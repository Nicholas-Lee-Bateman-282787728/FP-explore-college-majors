7341168,5,B011T0C71E,"BREAKING NEWS:
Doc Martin has been renewed for Season Eight, set to air in 2017.
For more information, read my comment dated January 20, 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------

Season Seven is the first time Doc Martin has been released on Blu-Ray.
Justified by the breathtaking scenery of Cornwall.
[also on DVD.]

I haven't heard of any plans to go back and re-issue the first six Seasons on Blu-Ray,

Season Seven includes nine behind-the-scenes featurettes (72 minutes).
All seven seasons have English SDH subtitles and are presented in the 16:9 widescreen mode.
---------------------------------------------------------

SERIES OVERVIEW:
Mr. Martin Ellingham (played by Martin Clunes) was a brilliant and prestigious surgeon in London,
who developed an unexplained aversion to the sight of blood (""Hemophobia"").
Unable to function, he retired to his boyhood home of Portwennn.
where he becomes Dr. Martin Ellingham, the brilliant General Practitioner.
No longer prestigious - local teens call him ""Tosser""
His receptionist is charged with drawing blood from patients.

TRIVIA:
Portwenn is portrayed by the picturesque seaside village of Port Isaac (population 721) in Cornwall, in the extreme southwest of Britain.
Impossibly beautiful real estate.
Port Isaac is nine miles down the coast from Tintagel, home of Tintagel Castle, legendary birthplace of King Arthur.*

""Mister"" = British surgeons are medical doctors, but in hospital they are addressed as ""Mister"" not ""Doctor""
(when Doc Martin visits his old hospital in Season One, a former colleague addresses him as ""Mr. Ellingham"" - before correcting himself).
This is a holdover from the Nineteenth Century:
Doctors diagnosed the patient's problem, then turned the poor fellow over to the Surgeon for treatment (usually amputation).
Surgeons were skilled craftsmen.
The faster they worked, the greater likelihood the patient would survive the operation.
Irony - In the Twentieth Century, surgery became the prestigious specialty.

""Tosser"" = British slang. A male who masturbates: An objectionable male.
Synonymous with ""wanker""

""Going Bodmin"" is a phrase sometimes encountered on the show.
Bodmin (population 15,000) is a town thirteen miles south of Port Isaac.
Home to the 200 year-old Bodmin County Lunatic Asylum.
""Going Bodmin"" means you are mentally ill.
Bodmin is also home to Bodmin Prison.

EARLY YEARS: DR. MARTIN BAMFORD
Martin Clunes originally played a character named ""Dr Martin Bamford"" in three prequels to the TV series.
- 2000: ""Saving Grace"" =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Grace/dp/B00003CXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Grace</a>
- 2001: ""Doc Martin"" (TV movie) and
- 2003: ""Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie"" (TV movie) =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOC-MARTIN-THE-MOVIES/dp/B0050N0UR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES</a>
The two TV movies  (but not ""Saving Grace"") are also included in the Season 1-5 box and the Season 1-6 box listed in the Buyer's Guide (see below).

Doc Martin is a minor character in ""Saving Grace"" (starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson), but he is the lead character  in the two TV movies.
Dr. Martin Bamford is a London obstetrician who discovers that his wife has been unfaithful.
Bitter and depressed, he moves to Port Isaac, a small seacoast town in Cornwall which he remembers from his childhood.
Filmed in Port Isaac, not yet known as ""Portwenn"".
The setting is the same, but the supporting cast is different (including a different love interest).
Martin Bamford is not Martin Ellingham.
He drinks and smokes (tobacco and otherwise), and has no problem getting his hands dirty by helping out on a local fishing boat.

SERIES 1-7: DR. MARTIN ELLINGHAM:
Dr. Bamford was not really going anywhere, so writer Dominic Minghella was called in to rethink the series' premise, and to create a new cast of supporting characters.
The first thing he did was change the doctor's name from Dr. Martin Bamford to Dr. Martin Ellingham.
""Ellingham"" is an anagram of ""Minghella"".

The revised series debuted in 2004 - New seasons have appeared at approximately two year intervals.
If you are new to Doc Martin, by all means start with Season One and watch the series in chronological order.
The plot line that begins with the first episode is still developing.
Save the ""Dr. Martin Bamford"" movies for last.  Though technically ""prequels"", they add nothing to the TV series.

2004 was also the year that ""House"" debuted on American television.
Doctors Gregory House and Martin Ellingham have a lot in common:
Brilliant physicians but dysfunctional human beings (House is also a secret Brit).
Each show is a combination of Medical Detective Story and comedy.
""House"" is much darker comedy - ""Doc Martin"" can sometimes seem a bit silly.
My two favorite TV shows of the 21st Century.
---------------------------------------------------------------

BUYER'S GUIDE
If you have not already  invested in the earlier ""Doc Martin"" DVDs, the most economical way to acquire the series is to buy the new Season 1-6 box:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Six-Surly-Seasons-The-Movies/dp/B011T0C5D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin, Six Surly Seasons + The Movies</a>
16 discs for $75 new.
Then buy Season Seven on DVD or Blu-Ray (reviewed on this page).

-- there was also a Season 1-5 box:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Special-Collection-Series-1-5-plus-the-Movies/dp/B00A27O0N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin Special Collection: Series 1-5 plus the Movies</a>
but you would then need Season Six (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Series-6/dp/B00FPPQYXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin Series 6</a>) in addition to Season Seven.

Both the Season 1-6 box and the Season 1-5 box also include the two made-for-TV ""Martin Bamford"" movies.
The Season 1-6 box is  packaged in two multi-disc DVD cases which slide into into an attractive cardboard slipcase.
The Season 1-5 box had six DVD cases (one for each season and the movies).
---------------------------------------------------------

* CAMELOT CONNECTION
Tintagel Castle (nine miles north of Port Isaac) is the birthplace of the legend of King Arthur.
Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falls in love with Igraine, wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall.
Gorlois believes his wife is safely protected within the walls of Tintagel Castle.
Under a spell from the wizard Merlin, Uther Pendragon assumes the appearance of Gorlois in order to gain entry.
Igraine believes him to be her husband, and ""in that night was the most famous of men, Arthur, conceived.""
(Geoffrey of Monmouth, 'Historia Regum Britanniae', written in 1136)

Prior to Doc Martin, Tintagel Castle was the most popular tourist attraction in Cornwall.
Photo 1 = Port Isaac
Photo 2 = Tintagel Castle
Photo 3 = Convenient footpath connecting the two (pay no attention to the broken footbridge)

The stretch of coast from Port Isaac to Tintagel is pretty isolated real estate.
The Port Isaac railway station closed in 1966.
Doc Martin is filmed in the summer, when the weather in Cornwall is almost Mediterranean.
Cornwall has the mildest and sunniest climate in the United Kingdom, due to its southerly latitude and the influence of the Gulf Stream.
Penzance, 55 miles southwest of Port Isaac, is the most popular seaside resort in Cornwall (thanks to Gilbert & Sullivan).

Photo 8 is a satellite photo of the Port Isaac region.
It shows a five mile stretch of coastline (Tintagel is a further four miles up the coast)
The inlet on the left is Port Isaac.
The next inlet is Port Gaverne, practically a suburb of Port Isaac.
Too shallow for fishing boats - Port Gaverne is basically a tourist beach.

P.S. I have a hopeless crush on Caroline Catz, the actress who plays Doc Martin's love interest Louisa Glasson.
Surprisingly, she has also had a parallel career in law enforcement:
In 2004, the year Doc Martin debuted, she was Detective Inspector Kate Ashurst in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-in-Suburbia-Complete-Collection/dp/B00KCA32XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder in Suburbia Complete Collection</a>.
This was a fairly lightweight (but enjoyable) police series.
In 2012, she joined the cast of DCI Banks, where she plays Detective Inspector Helen Morton, a much darker character:

7341185,2,B011T0C71E,"I jumped right in with Series 7 acting (rashly) based only on the large number of very positive reviews and a few snatches that I had stumbled on from time to time on the telly.  I should have looked a little closer before investing.

I understood that the doc had sociability problems although they didn't seem extremely off-putting from what I had glimpsed on TV.  I also understood that the series was ""quirky""  but did not expect that to be a problem based on Northern Exposure being a contender for my all-time favorite series.

Unsociable?  Let's just say that he is well along ""on the spectrum.""  You can care for and love such people but mostly if you have a blood connection.  I should say here that I only watched 1 1/2 episodes before I gave up, more or less in disgust.  What was true about the doc was also true about all the other quirky characters: There was nothing to redeem them; nothing appealing about them.  Nothing really amusing; nothing sympathetic; nothing interesting.

I thought about this series compared to Northern Exposure, and it was clear to me how different my response to the characters was.  Every character in NE has some reachable, sympathetic, likable side.  Every one, and they were seriously quirky, flawed people.  I felt nothing for the village idiots who populate Doc Martin's world as I felt nothing for Martin.  Nor did I find anyone funny.  It really is not funny when a moron does something stupid; it is funny when a person of some substance yields or is  seduced by an unwise course of action.

One of the things that attracted me to the series was the great location and photography.  That remains an attraction....but not sufficient, for me, given the characters and the writing that animates them.",1522886400,,1750,4.7161716171617165

7341206,3,B011T0C71E,"I have now seen all the seasons up through season 7. I really really enjoy all the quirky characters of Portwenn, and I hold out hope that poor Bert is someday going to catch a break. I really like Martin's Aunt Ruth, much more so than the Aunt Joan. It seems funny that there seems to be only one small knot of teen girls in town, all really rude and all with questionable fashion tastes. Morwenna is one of them, THIS is what she thinks is appropriate attire for work, but she isn't rude, just kind of really clueless. I like her much more than Pauline, who creeped me out. My favorite favorite character is Louisa, who I think has been pushing the boulder up the mountain for far too long, and IMO it is time for her to stop.

In seven seasons, Martin has not evolved in the slightest with his people skills. He is still insufferably rude to everyone, including his patients, and why they all put up with it, I don't know. He has said he loves Louisa, but he doesn't show it, he still goes on acting like, as she said, that he is convinced that he is better than anyone who is not as smart as he is, which he thinks is everyone. He sees no reason to be a partner to Louisa, but someone who still makes life decisions without needing to even mention them to her, let alone discuss them. He hurts her every day, and doesn't even see it. I know Martin is emotionally scarred from his own childhood, but he needs to get intensive therapy on his own before he can be a good husband, father and person. It has not been fun watching him treat everyone but Ruth like dirt, one season after another. I always hoped that he would evolve, but he never does, or even speaks of love, unless he is standing on a emotional cliff. Just telling Louisa he loves her isn't enough any more. I am hanging it up.

Also his constantly being able to diagnose disease on the spot, without any exams or tests, and have the needed medication in his bag, is getting really old.",1515801600,,1952,4.258760107816712

It is preposterous to suggest that whiskey is going to come out of Bert's still in the beautiful color of amber represented in the bottles, and to suggest (in series 8) that he can just fire up the still to satisfy a customer's order.

7341457,5,B011T0C71E,"This series caught our attention a few years back and we have become attached to the characters and the beautiful Port Isaac in north Cornwall on the England coast that is the setting for the fictional village of Portwenn.  The ""Doc"" is extremely obsessive, controlling, and incapable of showing emotion which makes for some poignant but mostly hysterical situations.  The episodes are best watch sequentially to understand all the relational dynamics.  However, if you've seen a few and get to know the characters, you can pick almost any of the episodes and be entertained by the mostly humorous interactions.  The writers do a great job of developing some very disturbed residents and adding occasional outside characters that add to the dynamics of the relationships between the main characters.  We really like the director's choices for the actors especially their range ages and their natural appearances which really makes the show more real or lifelike.  If this is the last series for this show, we will miss it greatly.",1481932800,6,1030,5.101190476190476

7341655,5,B011T0C71E,"Just what the doctor ordered, another healthy dose of the grumpiest physician ever loved by viewers. Martin Clunes continues his brilliant portrayal in this most recent season, as does Caroline Catz (Louisa) and the rest of the regulars. Dame Eileen Atkins as Aunt Ruth continues to deliver dry wit and wisdom, Baby James Ellingham is played by a succession of intensely adorable actors, and all eight episodes continue to ponder the question of whether Martin and Louisa can find happiness with each other. This season includes a wonderful cameo by Sigourney Weaver, who has admitted she's a Doc Martin fan (as is legendary children's book author Beverly Cleary!) No spoilers on these intriguing episodes, each more fun than the next, except to say, PC Penhale with a taser? Take cover! And never mind the Louisa-Martin question, what about the Martin-Buddy connection, can this fluffy, scruffy canine with Lassie-like loyalty make a dent in that Ellingham crust? Clunes, a real life animal advocate who adores all dogs, demonstrates his acting expertise by behaving rudely toward the little mutt who tries so hard and is determined to win the Doc's heart. Sit, stay, watch!
Acorn's beautifully rendered set of two discs includes a jam packed 72 minutes of superb behind the scenes extra features that will tempt you to pack for a trip to the fictional Portwenn, the glorious Cornwall location that is a character unto itself, enhancing the storylines. Each season, Doc Martin fans hold their breath, fearful that this may be the last..but so far we've continued to be rewarded with more happenings in a village populated by good people, quirky people and a doctor who treats them all. Season 7 may be the best yet, but we're still hoping for more, or as Martin would say ""Next patient!""",1462492800,,1788,4.983277591973244

7341707,5,B011T0C71E,"We love Doc Martin and watching Season 7 has been as enjoyable as we expected.  First there is Martin Clunes who never disappoints as the cranky offbeat Doc Martin, then there is the gorgeous Portwenn (Port Isaac a real-life place in Cornwall) and finally a wealth of eccentric characters that move in and out of Doc Martin's daily life.  Living for Doc Martin seems to require much more effort and worry than for the rest of humanity, and he can be exasperatingly fussy and rude to everyone in the process.  At the end of last season his wife has taken the baby and gone to Spain as a result of his bad behavior, she needs time to think about their relationship.  His patients and neighbors are equally unique personalities, taking the idea of small-town ""characters"" to the extremes, which in many cases makes it difficult for him to reform his own behavior as he feels he must.  If you have never seen Doc Martin, start with series one and you will be hooked as we are.....for those of you who are already fans, you will want to add season 7 to your collection.  Eight episodes with over 70 minutes of featurettes the trials and tribulations of Doc Martin make our lives seem easier, but perhaps not nearly as comical.",1459296000,,1221,4.552511415525114

7341714,5,B011T0C71E,"Series 7  premiered in the US on PBS in early 2016.  Doc Martin is one of those British programs that many Americans have fallen in love with. The Doctor is an uptight London surgeon who develops a fear of blood. He changes his specialty to GP and takes a position in rural  seaside village in Cornwall (filmed in Port Isaac).  Doc still has his surly moments dealing with the local populace. Even though he is rude to his patients he has an endearing quality that makes you like his character. The scenery is stunning and really another character in the story. The will they or wouldn't they of Doc's relationship with Louisa, a local school teacher, continues as they enter couples therapy.  This show falls under a combination of drama/comedy.  There are serious and comedic parts to each episode.  The issue of whether or not Bert Large and his son Al will ever catch a break and be successful at whatever they undertake continues with Bert on the wrong side of the law.  PC Penhale provides a comedic element without even trying. Aunt Ruth is still the stable force in Doc's life.  This series is filmed every two years and it has been said two more are on slate to be filmed in the future.",1459123200,4,1195,4.52093023255814

7341727,2,B011T0C71E,"Based on the first 4 episodes of this season, the show is pretty close to running on empty. What began as a witty and sometimes profound study of the human condition, in the early seasons, is now simply a soap opera, with a tangle of rather aimless plots and subplots. It would seem that a more frequent reliance on medical emergencies, in order to boost up dramatic tension/attention, has something to do with the lack of interesting chemistry between the central characters, the doctor and his wife.

I'm assuming that the absence of the brilliant and inventive series creator, Minghella, from these later episodes, has quite a bit to do with the show's devolution.",1458777600,2,667,4.850877192982456

7341745,3,B011T0C71E,"Since my view of season seven is clearly a minority opinion, readers should explore other reviews to get a balanced reaction.  I should also note that devotees of the show (and I am one) will certainly want to see season seven.  They may, however, wish to rent rather than buy or simply wait to see it on television.

The nature of my response is such that I should warn readers that the following comments are replete with SPOILERS and that they might want to wait until they see the series, lest they be disappointed in advance.

So here goes: season seven is the last season of the series (probably); it certainly looks and feels like the last.  There are eight episodes.  For the first seven the situation is entirely static.  Martin and Louisa are (painfully) unable to communicate; they are so dysfunctional that viewers may wish to reach into their television screens and shake them.  Bert is still struggling with his business and attempting others, with mixed results.  Ditto his son Al, whose romantic life is still going nowhere fast.  Ditto PC Penhale, whose police work continues to be feckless and his romantic life nowheresville.  Aunt Ruth is feisty but getting up there in years, trying to influence Martin (and trying to resist his influence on her).  Sally Tishell, the chemist, is still carrying a torch for Martin, still wearing her neck brace and still acting in a silly manner.  In other words, everything is pretty much the way its always been, but in spades.  The audience is put in a position of longing for change, longing for resolutions, longing for the eighth episode.  When it comes it is about 75% satisfactory but wholly unsatisfactory in its treatment of Martins relationship with Buddy, the dog who desperately wants to help Martin with his loneliness and who wants to save him, Lassie-like, when he falls afoul of some neer-do-wells.  The latter include Gemma Jones in a 2-episode appearance.  She performs her role expertly, of course, but her character is unpleasant at best, psychotic at worst.  Indeed, all of the characters in the season, with the exception of Aunt Ruth and Martins receptionist Morwenna, are relatively unpleasant, since they are stuck in their usual roles and manners.  Two other additionsRobyn Addison as the Ellinghams nanny, Janice and Emily Bevan as their therapist, Dr. Timoneycontribute relatively little to the small world of Portwenn.  Janice is twice married and flighty (thus making everyone nervous when she takes care of the Ellingham baby) and Dr. Timoney is strikingly young and, in a pinch, unreliable.  Everyone in the show talks about her seemingly-inappropriate youth, everyone, presumably, but the casting director.

There are some good savings by Dr. Ellingham, marching through muck, mire, thick and thin to treat patients, but there is very little humor.  Even in a quirky series you need some humor.  Instead, there is largely frustration, until episode eight.  Sigourney Weaver appears in a brief role as an ugly American tourist; again, all unpleasantness and no humor.  One tiny plot arc wrinkle involves the return of a man who was once in love (or at least in like) with Louisa, who he annoyingly calls Lou, until she orders him to stop.  He is there to make Martin jealous, but he is so obnoxious that he simply muddies the waters rather than clarifying the feelings.

I was disappointed with the season because I wanted more humor and better writing.  I felt as if my emotional response was heavily manipulated.  Worst of all, I felt as if I would be very unlikely to ever watch the episodes a second time.  I give points for effort; the actors are doing their bests but they are struggling with inept scripts.",1458000000,4,3700,4.90032154340836

This is the best of the delightful British series with the grumpy Doc and the village full of funny and quirky people that will not listen to his sound medical advice to his frustration.  If you have missed Doc Martin, this is worth investing in so you can enjoy the laughs and all the crazy characters around the central straight faced Doctor that rarely cracks a smile.  I can't wait for season 8, which won't be filmed until next year.  This is set in beautiful Cornwall on the English coast in a fishing village like no other.

Martin leaves his post at a hospital for a clinic in a seaside village. If to much is said you won't have the fun of finding out his quirks for yourself. You will come to love him and various people around the village.

The only complaint I have is that they are releasing new seasons of only 8 episodes only every other year - so it's a long wait between seasons, and the actors are getting noticeably older in what's supposed to be only over a couple years of time.

One mistake I made with this specific Blu Ray is that I played the second disc first - there's an ad sheet that is hiding the disc 1, and I didn't pay attention to the label on the disc to see that it was disc 2 of 2.  My wife and I were watching and felt like we were missing some episodes - we thought that since it was two years since we watched series 6 that we had just forgotten some details.  It wasn't until the season ended that I realized that we had been watching disc 2. Oops!!

Nevertheless, we were wary as we began to watch the episodes but were quickly relieved to realize that this season's episodes are stellar. Louisa does return early on in the season and she and Doc tiptoe around each other trying to get along. They do go to counseling, which is a real hoot with some surprising twists ... if you look deep enough at what goes on. The other characters are there and not too over the top: Aunt Ruth (still lovable), Bert Large (still annoying but lovable), Al Large (nice guy), Morwenna (lots of lines), and PC Penhale (a bit pathetic as usual). Sally Tishell has a lot to say, but things there take a refreshing twist as well!  The episodes (except for maybe one) are totally believable, though the Doc does have some rotten timing sometimes. Louisa is NOT a raving lunatic at all, like some say, and the Doc reacts (IMHO) exceptionally normal to some of the situations that arise between he and Louisa. What a GREAT season. And they've definitely set it up for a last season, Season 8, which has been announced for production in 2017. Sigh. I can't wait. Don't miss this season of Doc Martin and the lovable characters from beautiful Portwenn.",1454457600,3,1317,4.696969696969697

The relationships in the series are well developed, and always interesting. The characters are written with comedic balance which always plays well, and which are well-acted. Just binge-watched season 7.  If there were already an 8th season I'd segue right into watching that.  I hope it continues for many more seasons.

Martin Clunes is superb and utterly believable as this brilliant doctor with the rude personality.  And I looked forward to Aunt Ruth's wisdom except where her own health was concerned.  Spoiler alert: After a harrowing experience in the final(?) episode, I was very pleased with the outcome since I love happy endings.  I can only hope the producers will continue this series.

7342034,5,B011T0C71E,"""Doc Martin"" series 7 has already aired in the UK and will come to PBS here in the States early this year. But I couldn't wait; when the 2-disk DVD set became available in December, I bought it. This evening I finished the series and am left wanting more. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll only say the Series 7 features familiar veterans, an unexpected guest star, and a few new characters who bring with them an assortment of problems for Martin and possible romance for PC Penhale. I'll also say that the end minutes were beautifully done, and the final scene serves equally well as a final fade out or a possible segue to Series 8 if that should come about.

Martin Clunes has said he's willing to continue the character, but the final decision lies with ITV who finances the series. I'd love to see it continue, for it is everything I enjoy. So... here's hoping.",1451779200,99,877,4.447204968944099

I think I missed season 6. But I liked the previous seasons on the whole.

This one, 7, with its eight episodes, is badly directed and badly written.

The subplots were uncreative and held no interest. The main plot, the question of whether Martin and Louisa are going to get back together, goes on and on until the very end. At that point, Louisa becomes recognizable as herself again and so does Martin. Up to then, they each put on their worst personalities; it was impossible to like either of them (at one point Martin is on the verge of killing a small dog just because it follows him around, and is only stopped by Louisa walking in; why draw him as ruthlessly callous, when his limits had heretofore only been annoying thoughtlessness). Liking Louisa was hard to do due to the actor's face lift -- or something. Her face seemed hard, less mobile. [Actors should not have face lifts in the middle of a series they are involved in. In Modern Family the blond mother of three ('can't think of her name) has changed her face to such a degree in the current season I at first couldn't believe it was the same person for several episodes, and trying to figure out whether they'd put in a replacement was an extreme distraction. I stopped watching halfway through as I couldn't take her or her jokes seriously -- she seemed an unrecognizable cypher.)]

The young therapist for Louisa and Martin has some good moments (I am a therapist), at first, but then falls into incompetency, even before she hits her head and loses all professionality (she announces to Mrs Pitchel that they are her clients and tells her how they're doing! Like other teases nothing ever comes of this.)

The running story of the pharmacist, Mrs Pitchel (sp?), believing she and Martin are still in love (see season 2 or 3 or later) wore thin long since and is icky and insufferable. The bit where her husband comes back is unnecessary and uninteresting.

The bit where Louisa's old boyfriend comes to town is the same. The man is stupid, unbelievably intrusive, and he and the plot also lack interest.

The subplots with the policeman are also written uncleverly, although 'Joe' still manages to pull off as good a performance as possible, despite the script.

The other regular actors are also still good, although without much at all to play with. Eilene Atkins, as usual, however,  is interesting and perfect; she has a couple of sort of interesting interactions, with Bert and her own health -- about which a serious diagnosis comes, then dissolves into nothing! as if we'd never heard of it. (Wha?)

Two more well known actors show up towards the end: The estimable Jemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax as the sister of the bride, for one) shows up in two episodes; in the last one she turns up as a bad guy. She does fine, as expected of a seasoned actor.

And, Hello! Sigourney Weaver is in one episode, playing a quintessential American feminist who, needing a doctor, blows through Doc Martin's surgery long enough to give Morenna, the receptionist, a book on assertiveness training, which teaching figures in Morenna's later actions; but aside from that, not leaving a ripple. (Why did she take the super bit part? A mystery, always, no doubt.)

I had a laugh when someone fell down the stairs early on, I forget who -- maybe Martin; it must have been choreographed especially well, as I don't usually crack a smile at pratfalls of any kind.

Again: a waste of time. And my last dip into Port Wenn.",1450569600,10,3557,4.626984126984127

7342062,5,B011T0C71E,"I am utterly broken hearted. What happened guys? Even my hubby (who usually did other things about the house as I watched loyally) noticed the lack of energy in one of the main characters, Louisa.
He said, ""Why is Louisa (character) being so mean? Nobody wants to watch that. She isn't making any sense. Blows hot and cold. And MOSTLY COLD, especially as of late.
She NOW only seems to be interested in Martin because he was popular on the radio""???????
My hubby never really cared much for her callous ways before, but now, she is completely distant...
And I see it very clearly too... She is very uncaring...
To Martin and, seemingly, even to being on the show itself. We realize she doesn't write the show, but even her facial expressions were empty.
I don't know... Maybe that's the way they wrote those first few episodes of season 7,... Maybe the are building up to her leaving or something... but something isn't right. She even looks different. Honestly, she looks angry all the time. We wondered if she was ill (in real life) or maybe she is just tired?????
Anyway, I have to agree totally with him. She looks incredibly miserable... Like she doesn't want to be there. I WOULD GLADLY TAKE HER PLACE!!!! No... REALLY!!! LoL
But something has happened. Something is very different now and we, the viewer,  feel like we had possibly missed an entire season or some major event on the program.
BUT WE HAVEN'T!!! So, what gives?
Anyway gang, IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO SAVE THE SHOW, ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE SOME REDEEMING TO DO!!!
And PLEASE DO...
I LOVE MY BBC!!! I LOVE MY DOC MARTIN!!!
Bert Large (character) said once that they would keep going as long as we, the viewer, would let them.
Well... We are loyal fans and adore this wonderful British Comedy. So, please, ...get your groove back and realize how truly blessed you are by GOD above to have such an incredible opportunity, in doing this fabulous thing.
I was an extra for years at Wilmington, NC's Screen Gems (across the pond) and I know it is truly terribly hard work, and super long hours,... but you only go around once.
And if you are burnt out, as least ""go out"" leaving them wanting more. Please don't trash all these years of tv magic.
This show is far from out-of-story ideas... Especially in that gorgeous little village, with so much surrounding it.
So, I would just suggest that your writer's  hit or get off the plot... But please... Don't run it into the dirt.
Just a note:
 This show has given me a new bucket list dream: TO VISIT CORNWALL!!!!!
But sadly, with the current invasion of Europe erasing any sign of BRITISH CITIZENS, coupled with the fear of a flying issue, well... both just terrify me now...
But I would just love to visit (or live) in my ancestral home. AND... I'd give my left arm to be an extra on the show <3
I don't like criticizing my favorite show, but I am just so sad that it feels as if you are throwing in the towel, right when you were on top of your game!!!!!! Don't cha feel THE LOVE ANYMORE???????
If need be, get a replacement love interest for Martin.
But don't turn it into a horrible show about him always hurting or cowering to a mean, unloving woman who can't make up her mind what she wants... (or only loves Doc if he is continually impressing her)!!! If you ask me, Doc Martin is the normal one in that relationship! There's no satisfying her. Ok, I've said my peace. Please...

I am a HUGE Doc Martin fan and can and have watched every episode from season 1 to 6 atleast five times! I thought I would die from  excitement in anticipation for series 7, but I think I expected more than what I got...
I feel like the characters are no better off than the last couple of series ago. I was wanting to see more development between Doc Martin and Louisa, a little more connection and feeling. I think that all the distractions, disruptions and drama is just a little much. I mean, I know the writers don't want to make things too predictable or fairy tale, but my goodness.
I still love the beautiful scenery and all the townsfolk, but I have a feeling that we're drawing close to the end of this wonderful series, because how long can the Doc and Louisa keep having all these issues?

7342076,4,B011T0C71E,"It's a fun series.  However, I can't understand why anyone compares it to House, other than that the two shows both have doctors with social issues.  House is a much darker character, displays more genius, and is more seriously screwed up.  House knows what a normal life is but doesn't want it, and his constant acerbity is deliberately designed to inflict pain.  Martin Ellingham thinks he is normal but in fact doesn't know what normal is, when it comes to personal relationships.  ""House"" takes place in a high pressure institutional corporate environment that isn't even remotely similar to the quirky lifestyles of Doc Martin's Portwenn.

The real comparison is with Northern Exposure (another doctor in star role).  Both Northern Exposure and Doc Martin are light romantic comedies in a small town with eccentric characters, where the two would-be lovers can never quite get past their own inhibitions to make a serious expression of love and commitment to one another.  Northern exposure was a good show, this is too.  Dr. Joel Fleischman is exiled to Cecily Alaska because of the contract he signed to fund his medical studies.  Doc Martin is exiled to Portwenn by his blood phobia.  Both leave behind career paths in ultra professional sophisticated urban centers.",1449705600,2,1274,5.076923076923077

Doc's personality was a very large part of the humor. The whole cast knew their parts meshed perfectly. The whole thing in season seven seems as if they had never rehearsed because it is so amateurish. The writing is bad, the acting isn't up to snuff because they haven't anything to work with. We know their potential. They either need to start over, or pull this series because it's ruining the image of the first six. Louisa is hateful and mad all the time in these first three episodes
If you haven't already, don't buy it. You will be disappointed..Live with the memory of the first six seasons.
UPDATE: E-4 was very good. It's like they found their footing. After the first three, I about decided that I did not care to watch the rest. My wife asked that we watch and I'm glad we did.

7342084,5,B011T0C71E,"Doc Martin, Series 7. All eight brand-new episodes from the seventh and final series of the British  television comedy/drama series, made/broadcast by ITV in the United Kingdom, shown by PBS in the United States, which developed  massive followings both sides of the pond.  As ever, stars BAFTA winner Martin Clunes (MEN BEHAVING BADLY, ARTHUR & GEORGE), in the title role as the belligerent Dr. Martin Ellingham. Whose bad manners and unusual ways cause tension among the locals in the picturesque Cornish fishing village  Portwenn. In this season of the British Comedy Award-winning production, Martin tries to fix his marriage and raise his son James Henry. After his-now  wife Louisa (Caroline Catz, DCI BANKS, MURDER IN SUBURBIA), had decided she needed some time away, taken James Henry, headed to her Mums in Spain. Bert (Ian McNeice, DR. WHO, DUNE) tries his hand at making whisky, PC Penhale (John Marquez, JONATHAN CREEK), gets his very own police issue Taser. Martins formidable Aunt Ruth, (Emmy-winner Dame Eileen Atkins, CRANFORD, UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS), is in declining health. The Large family, Al (Joe Absolom, HATFIELDS & MCCOYS), and Bert, try various unsuccessful business ventures.  Jessica Ransom is back as beautiful Morwenna, in an on-again off-again flirtation with Al Large, and Selina Cadell, as the neck-brace wearing pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell, who suddenly remembers that she has a husband of her own. The episodes are: 'Rescue Me', 'The Shock of the New', 'It's Good to Talk', 'Education, Education, Education', 'Control-Alt-Delete', 'Other People's Children', 'Facta Non Verba' and 'The Doctor Is Out'.

With his marriage in trouble, Martin agrees to see a therapist, smart young Dr. Rachel Timony, (Emily Bevan, THE CASUAL VACANCY). As a know it all holistic veterinarian, daughter of the general practitioner Martin replaced, Caroline Quentin, BLUE MURDER, MEN BEHAVING BADLY), also creates trouble. Gemma Jones, (BRIDGET JONESS DIARY, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY), forcefully carries a two-episode arc, another high point of her long career.  Oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver, (ALIEN, AVATAR), puts in an appearance as a manipulative American tourist. Wha?  (According to IMDb, Clunes and Weaver were co-starring on a British TV chat show, talking up other vehicles.  Weaver revealed that she was a longtime fan, had gone to school with Selina Cadell [Mrs.. Tishell]. Hey, Presto, a cameo for Sigourney).

For anyone whos been living in a cave, Dr. Martin Ellingham, London-based surgeon, relocated to Portwenn, established himself as the area's general practitioner. He grew up there, as he had largely been raised by his now widowed Aunt Joan Norton (Stephanie Cole, in past seasons). The reason he left his high-paid London life is initially not clear, but we soon learn it is a blood phobia he had recently developed. He will, too, soon meet several locals, discover that eccentricity abounds. The doctor's situation is made more difficult by an almost complete lack of an acceptable bedside manner: he is caustic, gruff, abrupt, intolerant. Surly, tactless, self-centered, uptight.  Luckily, hes the only doctor in town. Still, he and the headmistress of the local school, Louisa Glasson, are attracted to each other; despite their awkwardness, slowly develop a relationship.

The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of eight episodes on two disks, running approximately 383 minutes, plus nine bonuses running approximately 72 minutes, a photo gallery. Beware, there are some graphic medical scenes; praises be, there are subtitles.  Well, somehow, during the separation of Martin and Louisa, they seem to this viewer to have lost some of their chemistry.  And the series seems a little heavier on drama than on comedy.  But the production retains its quirky charm, wit, zest for life.  Still addictive, after all these years: Portwenn's  a fine and funny place to spend the evening.",1448928000,4,3928,5.349025974025974

Instead, it rolled along into nothingness save for the last 10 seconds.  I could have written a much better season 7.  After the disaster of Season 6 where Martin goes goofy  and the last episode sitting poorly, I loomed forward to Season 7 redemption.  You Let us down.",1448150400,19,537,4.552083333333333
7342087,5,B011T0C71E,"Sweetly funny. Laid-back charm, I agree with Dame Eileen Atkins. Its amazing. Family fun comedy-drama. An ongoing continuing life story of Portwenn and all the quirky fishing village characters. This series is produced by Philippa Braithwaite, real spouse of Martin Clunes-Doc Martin. She and he also did the earlier TV films that introduced the series. They, along with a fantastic cast, keep this series prime and fresh. I strongly recommend every Doc Martin series, earlier series available separately or sets.

Caroline Catz (DCI Banks) plays Louisa the troubled wife. Atkins is Aunt Ruth, who not only acts to the level of her 'Dame' title, but is known for crating and writing classics Upstairs Downstairs and House of Eliott. Add the father/son Bert (Ian McNeice) and Al Large (Joe Absolom), PC Penhale (John Marquez), Rx Sally Tishell (Selina Cadell) yet in neck brace, and Morwenna (Jessica Ranson) even beautiful in her wild costumes. Its a team hard to perfect, but perfect Doc Martin does in series 7 with Emily Bevan as Dr Timoney and Nanny Janice (Robyn Addison). Why use guest starsbut they are on board too.

 SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes and bonus film footage

=5=Control-Alt-Delete ==Martin decides to rid himself of his stray dog Buddy. Louisa tries on a family leadership role. Ruth discovers Berts caravan distillery. Penhale holds a romantic BBQ. Well, in each case-almost.
=6=Other People's Children ==Baby Jamess 1st birthday bash collides with his moms ex-boyfriends return with a pack of kids. Of course the other village threads continue to unravel.
=7=Facta Non Verba ==Couples counseling failing-will Doc & Louisa be estranged forever? Bert fails at yet another job and goes to handyman. New art teacher in town. Sigourney Weaver appears as an American tourist. Gemma Jones (Duchess of Duke Street) as aged patients wife and will also appear in the final episode. Even PC Penhale looks for a change.
=8=The Doctor Is Out ==Make or break time for Doc and wife. First Doc is held hostage. Lives of Aunt Ruth, Bert, & Al all find yet another new twist, leaving Doc Martin fans begging for Season 8. Finale has a bit of everything & everyone youd expect-A super story.
Even Buddy barks his approval.

7342088,3,B011T0C71E,"Back in series one of Doc Martin, when Dominic Minghella developed this dramatic comedy, there were new, fresh characters, interacting and developing their relationships, even if rarely changing themselves. But we loved it, for the Cornish landscapes, the quirky people, the drama and the humour.

Things got cosy in the next few series, with everyone firmly where he or she belonged, and the odd character replaced by someone else mostly taking on the same role as before. But we still loved it, because the story evolved, albeit slowly.

Fast forward to series seven, and things have begun to go stale. This is not a necessity, as the dynamic between the two main characters is in dire need of growth and closure. Instead, what we get is more of the same. But worse, even though some of the scriptwriters from earlier series have done their job well on the individual episodes, things are off track when it comes to the overarching storyline.

In fact, it feels as if in a jack-of-all-trades-manner the star and the producer came up with this muddled chain of events that totally misses a third act. It might be that originally twelve episodes were planned and then production costs were cut. But that just would have meant adapting the story. That, however, has not happened.

What we are left with is more of the same, but with less love, engagement and professionalism on the big scale. Clearly, some people are caring less than before, and it shows.

Very good picture quality with the ROKU HDMI stick.  ACORN TV has available for viewing the entire series.  These two episodes were kind of sad with Louisa coming back from Spain and with no decent apartments available in town, Doc Martin moves out from the upstairs living quarters but keeps the doctor's facility on the first floor.  The aunt has some weird eye problem and forgoes her move to London.  The farm B&B finally has their first customers and that turns out badly.
There are enough loose ends begging for additional episodes so one can hope Series 8 gives us more .  Amazon says they won't release until December 2015 which doesn't make a whole lot of sense as well as no hint at their price for the complete season/series 7.
Amazon is now advertising 8 episodes for the 7th edition.  But they are also advising you should put this 2 episode item in your cart (for later delivery) at a cost of $26.99.
