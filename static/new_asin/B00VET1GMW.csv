8709863,2,B00VET1GMW,"The artwork on the DVD is way more satisfying than the film itself. I'm not picky when it comes to horror films, ill watch them from any sub genre to any kind of budget, but this was just bad.",1453075200,,192,3.948717948717949
8709864,1,B00VET1GMW,"The film was designed to be a campy slasher film. A masked killer is murdering teens simply because he can. Grundy County, Tennessee is the home of the Yellow Jackets and no amount of killing will stop the football game lead by obnoxious QB Sky Walker (Richard Chilton).

The film was low budget. It had bad sound, lengthy bad dialogue lasting far too long, bad acting, bad effects, and bad lighting. It also had the worst rap lip sync I have ever seen, perhaps the comedy highlight of the film.

A film that is ""so bad its bad.""

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Very fake male organ nudity.",1451520000,5,582,4.420560747663552
8709865,1,B00VET1GMW,"Remember ""Amateur Night At The Apollo"", where someone so bad would come out and sing so off-key that they would be literally booed off-stage? Well, this movie is the equivalent of that. This is one of the most amateurish films I have seen in the past 20 years and my only hope is that director/screenwriter/editor/co-producer Chuck Conry never gets behind a camera again (This was his freshman effort and, hopefully, his only film for all eternity. He even has the nerve to state that we should feel lucky that he was able to track down the ""lost"" footage. What lost footage? It was shot in 2012 and they added footage to the film for the next two years. They didn't take anything away!). After an on-screen warning that advises those with bad hearts or mental illness should not watch this film (it should have said anyone with a heart and a brain, period) and then a quote by R.D. Laing (A Scottish psychiatrist considered an expert on mental illness who passed away in 1989. I wonder what he would have said about this film? Throw Chuck Conry in a rubber room?), the film gets underway and we see two very bad actors talk about the merits of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978) over Bob Clark's BLACK CHRISTMAS (1974), George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) and Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 (1986) as being the scariest film. It's so badly acted, that when one guy explains that the reason Quentin Tarantino's DEATHPROOF (2007) failed was ""People don't watch horror movies for the witty banter."", I wanted to kill them both, not because of their movie references (many of them I agree with), but because their acting stunk worse than a fish left out in the hot sun (But, believe it or not, this is the best acting in the film!). Luckily, there a killer on the loose, dressed in a black suit with a red tie and wearing one of those white S&M hoods over his head with a zipper for a mouth. He enters the house through a bathroom window and kills one of teens while he is taking a shower and then takes the glasses off the second victim and stabs him repeatedly with the big knife he carries (the makeup effects are as bad, if not worse, than the acting). Yes this is a gore film, without any realistic gore and it is so cheap, when the news channel on ""Grundy TV"" (filmed in Grundy, Tennessee) breaks in for a special report on the two murders, the ""News 6"" sign was definitely made by some unstable person with a black magic marker. We then have the female newscaster (who is eventually disposed of by the killer with a ball peen hammer) go on to an interview with a drunk Sheriff Rollins (I refuse to name any of the actors in this film because they are not actors at all; just ""regular"" people trying to act and failing so badly that they should ride the short bus to school), who says they weren't murders at all, but actually a double suicide (!) because their house was full of horror movies (Way to perpetrate the myth Chuck!). The Sheriff then goes on to say that the football game will go on as scheduled and then goes on a long rambling rant about how great Grundy's ""Yellow Jacket"" quarterback Sky Walker is. We then see Sheriff Broshdursky trying to find the location of Sky Walker's house, since he thinks the killer is going to strike there (Hasn't he heard of Google Maps, GPS or just calling 411?). The killer then cuts the head off the girlfriend who steps out of his truck to have a smoke and then gets inside the truck while we watch someone throw a bucket of blood inside the truck's front window. We then see Sky Walker's ""huge"" party, which consists of about 10 people. Sky Walker talks about himself in the third person, which is so awful since he is such a bad actor, we hope his death comes soon. All the women at this party are ugly as sin, so this is one case when we hope they don't remove their tops (it comes close in one situation, but it is apparent that none of these girls wanted their breasts on-screen and I thank them for that). Thankfully, the killer makes Sky Walker his next victim after he loses a drinking contest. He goes outside to throw-up and has his head run over with a car (all we see is hamburger meat with a human eyeball in the middle). We then have to put up with a black & white ""tribute video"" of Sky Walker's best moments (there must not be many because it runs less than a minute) while the screen says ""In Memory Of Sky ""F*****g"" Walker: The Greatest Grundy QB Of All Time"", while listening to two d-bags playing a guitar and singing a tribute ballad (I threw up on my mouth a little). Rather than going on with the non-plot, I'll just give you the kills: * A boy gets stabbed in the stomach with the knife (it's apparent that the boy is holding the knife at his side with his arm and then has his arm cut off with a wood saw (the serrated edges of the blade never touch him and then we see the killer pulling off a fake arm). * The killer murders a girl by impaling her stomach with the boy's severed arm. * A guy is kneed in his stomach by his girlfriend (who has her midsection eviscerated by a crow bar, as the camera spends way too much time lingering on it) and then the killer murders the boyfriend by hitting him with an aluminum bat and then dropping the hood of his Jeep on him. * The killer enters Sky Walker's party  and two men are stabbed in the stomach. * One guy has his eyes removed (off-screen). * A girl has a knife shoved in her mouth.* The final girl says the killer must have a small manhood, so he opens his pants to reveal a three foot long manhood! He smacks her across the face with it a couple of times before Sheriff Brosdursky (who earlier gave a dying kid his cell phone to call the police station, which was empty!) empties his gun into the killer, the girl cuts off his manhood with some hedge clippers (and gets a face full of blood) and then beats his head-in with a brick. The film stops with ""THE END"" on screen, but we then see the killer get up and removed his mask. Just before we see who it is, the film then shows ""THE END?"" on-screen.  Everything about this movie is a cheat and I can't believe I spent $10.00 for this piece of crap on DVD. This film has a troubled production history and it shows. In 2012, it was supposed to make it's debut on VOD, but some technical glitches with the film stopped it from being shown streaming (this version ran 75 minutes), so Chuck Conry filmed more footage in 2013 & 2014 and released a ""Director's Cut"" which ran 86 minutes. It doesn't help that the final closing credits run over 5 minutes (most of it listing bad music by Facebook bands you never heard of that played on the soundtrack) and have the nerve to thank Astron 6 (MANBORG - 2011; FATHER'S DAY - 2011; THE EDITOR - 2014) and many other famous people that don't deserve this abuse (including Don May Jr., who wouldn't touch a film like this even if he were wearing a radiation suit!) This film is so bad, that one actor is listed twice in the opening credits and everyone else couldn't get a job in a burger joint, rather than another movie. Some people should be never be allowed to direct and Chuck Conry is definitely one of them. It's not even the type of film that is ""so bad, it's good"". It's just pitiful and I'm usually fair when it comes to reviews of movies. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of dog manure. A Wild Eye Releasing DVD Release (it lists that it is the 75 minute version, but it's the full Director's Cut.). Not Rated.",1446508800,6,7465,4.323823109843081
