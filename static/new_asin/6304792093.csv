This DVD (Previously launched  in VHS format) bring to us, update interviews with some of our heroes, an  interesting overview of the backstage of these productions, a brief history  of the creator and producer and a lot of fun and good memories. "" As  creator and producer, Irwin Allen's objective was not to over-analyze or  intellectualize the storylines, nor scientifically educate the viewing  audience. More often than not, continuity was an afterthought. The show was  purely and simply intended to be family entertainment ...""

938351,5,6304792093,"I love this documentary. It covers Irwin's whole life story and all his work over the years. It makes me want to search down all those classic sci-fi adventures. It covers his birth to his death. He created 4 classic TV series and many movies, all are covered in t his 90 minute program. So if you like classic sci-fi this is for you. Hosted by June Lockhart, Bill Mumy and the Robot. I never liked Dr. Smith. I always felt his performance it was way over the top. I know he was written like that, but that wasn't for me. He helped make Lost In Space a hit.",1371859200,,557,4.1192660550458715

938356,5,6304792093,"This documentary style presentation brings back delightful, innocent and much loved memories about the ""sixties"" science fiction shows we all watched and loved. The narration is perfect, the clips are entertaining and just long enough to really remember what it was like to watch your favorite show in the sixties. Irwin Allen is truly explained and documented, one gets a wonderful perspective of the man and the legend. The Bio on Irwin Allen fills in the gaps and also sheds light on his style, and why we liked certain aspects of his style. This compilation is truly satisfying and one would not be dissapointed.",1283299200,,616,4.9326923076923075

938360,4,6304792093,This is a good Irwin Allen documentary developed for television. Billy Mumy and June Lockhart host this history of Mr. Allen from his early days in radio to his later role as producer of television shows and movies. All of his well-known shows and movies are reviewed; however some of his less known shows are overlooked. The guest appearances by the robot and Dr. Smith are over the top and too camp.,1226880000,,401,4.583333333333333
938431,5,6304792093,"Definally for anyone who grew up in the 60s and was into fantasy science ficton. This documentary, hosted by Lost In Space co-stars Bill Mumy and June Lockhart, as well as the Robot, is about the history of series creator Irwin Allen. It details his earliest beginings in Hollywood, his long time association with Groucho Marx, his forays into filmmaking such as The Big Circus and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and his sci-fi tv series, Voyage, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, Land of the Giants, and the two big blockbuster disaster movies of his career, The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. This DVD also has some nice extras such as the behind the scene filming of this special, and to top it all off, a surprise appearance by Special Guest Star Jonathan Harris at the very end. As with other Irwin Allen productions, this DVD also contains star studded appearances by Barbara Eden, Red Buttons, David Hedison, Al Lewis, Steve Allen, Deanna Lund, Marta Kristen, Bob May, Mark Goddard, Angela Cartwright, Dick Tufeld and much much more.",1191542400,,1049,4.801104972375691
938432,4,6304792093,"I must confess, I wish there had been more time spent on Time Tunnel, which was the shortest lived of Irwin Allen's shows, but should have had the longest run.  I also enjoyed seeing James Darren in The Man From the Twenty-fifth Century, a demonstration film, which never aired and is admittedly only 17 minutes long.  I wish it had been fleshed out into a TV movie starring James Darren.  The parts with Jonathan Harris were fun too.",1183161600,,434,4.538461538461538
938433,4,6304792093,"_If you remember these televison shows and movies from your younger days then this is a pleasant nostalgic experience. I also found it amazing just how much of what I found interesting on TV as a boy came from one man's vision. I think this was because there was a genuine enthusiasm in Irwin Allen for the future- and for adventure and monsters. There is quite alot of biographical footage about Allen's life thrown in (it is afterall a biographical presentation) but enough clips of the television shows and movies are included to satisfy everyone.  The whole show is held together well by Bill Muny and June Lockhart- not too serious and not too hammy.

The show covers the early movies: The Sea Around Us, Animal World, The Story of Mankind, The Big Circus, Five Weeks in a Balloon, The Lost World, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (I remember the last three from Saturday matinees at the movies.)

Then it moves on to the four great science fiction television shows: Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, and Land of the Giants. The clips are well chosen- and there are plenty of interviews with cast members and guest stars.
There are even clips from two shows that didn't make it- ""Man from the 25th Century"" and ""City Beneath the Sea.""

The rest centers primarily around his block buster movies such The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno- as well as all the other disaster flicks that followed.

You know it is funny, even as a kid I recognised the overuse of stock film footage, and the inane dialog, and the lack of scientific accuracy in much of his work- but I still watched it. I guess that was because the dream and the enthusiasm of other worlds was still there- even if he tried to do it on a low budget.",1141689600,3,1756,4.492163009404389
938434,4,6304792093,"Basically I am doing research on TV shows and movies.  Irwin Allan was one of the true characters that spanned both TV and Film.

This DVD is everything that is advertised.  You also get bonus features that give you a look into Irwin Allen on the studio lot.

What I found as a great surprise in special features was the ""Pitch"" TV shows that didn't make it.  A great lesson in blending story boarding and live action to communicate your ""idea"" to the people who will buy it.

Film and TV people today might laugh at the series Irwin created.. But there is much to learn from even today.  Like all science fiction TV producers, Gerry Anderson, Gene Rodenbery, and others... Irwin threads the needle with his distinct vision of the future.

The music of ""the worlds of"" Irwin Allen is done from John Williams.. A true genius that everyone seemed to take for granted until Star Wars and Jaws.  Much of the special effects and the suspension of belief that is needed to enjoy ""Lost in Space"" and ""Time Tunnel"" was the music from Johnny Williams.

If you're going to make a sci-fi Indy film, TV show or ??  This DVD should be seen and studied.  This really goes for the new filmmakers that have never seen ""Land of the Giants"" or ""Voyage to the bottom of the sea"".

I would surely give this 5 stars if it wasn't part of a 1996 Sci-Fi Channel project.  (seen on the sci-fi channel) If you had a Timex watch.. Give it to the ""talent"" at Sci-Fi and surely it would STOP TICKING.

938435,5,6304792093,"Great fun to re-aquaint myself with these old shows. Hilarious line from Billy Mumy, and I paraphrase, ""Irwin Allen was always looking for ways to top himself."" meaning to improve on his work after the The Towering Inferno. Over here it means to commit suicide...

It's a shame that most of the tv material here is not yet available as DVD boxsets. My credit card is waiting in aniticipation!",1125878400,3,392,4.681159420289855

938438,5,6304792093,"Irwin Allen in the 1960s was the master of scifi, fantasy and disaster. He was known to think big on a tight budget. This DVD gives a true perspective of the works of Irwin Allen. I am also a fan of ""Lost in Space"", and so having Billy Mumy and June Lockhardt narrate the special was a wonderful treat. It was  also fun to watch the robot make an appearance (even though his right arm needed repair) and a cameo appearance by the late, great Jonathan Harris.
Although the special was meant to show Irwin's greatest accomplishments, the only small critical point I would personally make is that the special did not truly tell of the faults of some of these shows and films. But that did not take away from the true imagination that Irwin Allen truly had.
I was not disappointed with this 90 minute DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""Lost in Space"", ""Time Tunnel"", ""Land of the Giants"", ""The Poseidon Adventure"", ""Towering Inferno"" and the other films Irwin has produced and directed. I wish it were longer. I wish there were even more interviews and behind the scenes clips.
If you enjoy these films and shows, I can't imagine that you would not enjoy this DVD. Thanks, Mr. Allen, for your contribution to the entertainment field. You have paved the way for many other science fiction hit series and films. He did what he could with what he had in the 60s and 70s.
This DVD is a real treat and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reminiscing about the earlier SCI FI dramas.",1074124800,32,1532,4.413427561837456
938439,5,6304792093,"As a 60's teen, my sister and I had an ongoing debate over which was better, ""Lost in Space"" or ""Star Trek"". While I preferred the juvenile adventure of the former (with the exception of the awful second season), she was in the corner of Roddenberry's more ""adult"" baby. Both would last just three seasons, although ""Trek"" would prove to be a ""cash cow"" for Paramount through its later movie and television reincarnations.
That withstanding, this video documents, as others have stated, the career of ""Space"" creator/producer Irwin Allen with footage covering his four ""classic"" series, three successful theatrical films (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" ""The Poseidon Adventure"", and ""The Towering Inferno"") and the truly ""disastrous"" later productions ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"", ""The Swarm"" and the laughable ""When Time Ran Out"".
Fortunately, fond memories of the television shows, as recalled by cast members, and the cool effects (for the time) make this a keeper.
I can even forgive ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion""!

A nice look behind the scenes that you might enjoy better than the series episodes themselves.
