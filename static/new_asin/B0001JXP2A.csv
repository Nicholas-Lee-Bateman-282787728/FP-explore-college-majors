2005648,5,B0001JXP2A,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this DVD set, in more ways than one.

First, if I've ever seen these before it was when I was too young to remember.  I found the comedy fresh, and about as good as an Abbott and Costello movie.  Supporting stars in the various movies include Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, Gene Lockhart, Lloyd Bridges, Edgar Kennedy, William Frawley, John Qualen, Donald MacBride, and others.  But the performance by young Larry Simms as the precocious Baby Dumpling is outstanding, adorable, and hilarious, and so is Daisy the dog.  Between these two they put the Blondie movies in that league of films you ought to own - because you'll want to watch them over and over.

Second, two discs include TEN 70 minute movies (not short TV episodes - the total time is not correctly listed on the box).  That's $1/movie, about the best DVD bargain you'll find.

Finally, the sound is clear and the video quality surprisingly good for a cheap DVD.  I've got many older movies on DVD and they're often scratchy and noisy; not these Blondie movies which almost look like they've been re-mastered like the high-end DVDs.

I'm buying a second set for my brother's family for Christmas.",1093910400,22,1200,4.725961538461538
2005649,1,B0001JXP2A,"It was just a matter of time before the sharks came out to infest the DVD world with inferior ""product"" like they did a couple of decades back with VHS. There's a new rule in my house: if the name Platinum Disc Corporation is on the box, avoid purchasing the same way you avoid disease. No care has been taken to obtain good prints, the visuals are murky and the sound choppy, the constant corner bug to let you know what miserable company is responsible for the mess (PIP...what does that stand for? shouldn't it be PDC? Did they change their name? After their latest batch of releases, an even newer name change should be in order, if they are to ever get any one to buy their junk releases.)

Don't let the bright, attractive packaging fool you. Buyer beware! And by all means, film buffs beware!",1092960000,31,799,4.4353741496598635
2005650,1,B0001JXP2A,"I was appalled that these 1960's TV cuts were released to DVD.  When I bought this set, I was hoping for the original Columbia releases but no such luck.  I suppose these are better than nothing, but barely.  When (or if) Columbia puts out an offical release of these great films, I will promptly throw this set in the garbage where it belongs.  Why these films were butchered in the first place remains a 40 year old mystery to me.  And that opening theme song they came up with is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard!  Very disapointing!",1090713600,17,549,4.494949494949495
2005651,1,B0001JXP2A,"Don't take a chance on these discs as I did...wait for a studio release of the movies instead.
Platinum has done the type of job which could be expected of them...poor.
First, the transfer was made, not with the original films, but with the syndicated television versions of later years. Thus, each movie starts with excerpts from the movie to follow, and then with the King Features Syndicate opening credit sequence.
The picture on these transfers are muted grays. Never do any of the blacks look black, or whites look white.
WORST OF ALL, concerning the video portion....Platinum has elected to place a company logo ""bug"" in the lower right hand corner...just the type of nonsense that one buys DVD's to avoid!!!!
The sound is equally poor...a steady stream of background noise appears throughout the movie, and the volume must be turned up to hear the dialogue.
All in all, this is a set to avoid, regardless of your feeling toward these movies.",1088726400,55,949,4.828220858895706

I've been requesting TCM to pick up the films but so far no luck.  I found that the first 10 movies were available on DVD so had to get them to add to my DVD collection and I'm glad I did.

Not for everyone I'm sure, but if you don't mind black/white and old fashioned, they are great.

Well, I do like seeing these movies again and enjoy the antics of Dagwood. What I forgot (or didn't realize) is how corny these movies are. Okay, for the time (30's/40s), there were (and still are) good clean humor with some far-fetched plots. Maybe that's what makes them fun.

I will say, the restoration is really good for these old black & white movies. Each previews with a snippet of the film then goes into the opening credits to full movie. They are short films about an hour each so, you don't have to wait too long to escape the mundane plot lines. Don't get me wrong, these are pretty enjoyable films even for this day and age. Good clean family fun!

2005730,5,B0001JXP2A,"I remember when I was a child in the '70's and these movies were televised on weekend afternoons on my local UHF channel.  My sister and I loved watching them then and I have enjoyed re-watching them as an adult.  They are fun and silly, but also very interesting sociologically.  I find it fascinating to see what sort of dialogue, plot lines, and gender/racial stereotypes were considered acceptable at that time.  Also, it is interesting to see what sort of fashions, dances, songs and jokes were popular at the time (late 1930's-early '40's).  The quality of the films are not outstanding, but you get what you pay for, and for me this was really about reminiscing rather than about having an excellent copy of the original films.

As an adult I really love watching Penny Singleton's portrayal of Blondie Bumstead.  She is a joy to watch, and clearly loved performing.  Kids today might reject this as being too old-fashioned, and if they do watch it you might get some interesting questions from them about certain scenes that are not ""politically correct"" by today's standards.  Two examples: African-American characters are rare and when they do appear are presented as dumb, ignorant, and superstitious;  Blondie is frequently portrayed as a jealous shrew who is quick to threaten to leave Dagwood at the drop of a hat.  One must take these things in the context of the time in which the films were produced, though, which is why I find the series to be an informative historical ""document"" as well as nostalgic entertainment.",1394841600,4,1535,4.865384615384615

2005732,3,B0001JXP2A,As close as you could get to live versions of the comic strip characters. But the entire series was just too much for me to take. Perhaps if each title had been packaged with a 40s 'A' film. The concept would have worked with 'Blondie' a warn up feature. As they would have been when released. As is I soon stopped being amused and became bored. I would advise taking in small doses if a buyer.,1389571200,,394,4.197368421052632

As I recall  the 1950's series was funny and well done.  But the 1930's series is just not so good.  The acting is pretty bad.

2005762,5,B0001JXP2A,"The Blondie movies have been outrageously underrated by film historians but the public has been lapping them up for almost 70 years now. They are still wildly funny and unlike other ""family"" series notably the Andy Hardy movies, they are never cloying and smothering in phony sentiment. These little gems are outright comedies with laughs still potent after all these years. Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake are brillantly cast as Blondie and Dagwood, as a comic team they deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as their uptown contemporaries William Powell & Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy & Katharine Hepburn. Singleton and Lake also had the added assistance of an amazingly funny toddler, Larry Simms as Baby Dumpling, and Daisy, the funniest dog in the movies bar none and that includes Powell/Loy's beloved Asta.

This ten movie collecton is an absolute bargain - just $1 per movie. It is a bit disappointing that this DVD series uses TV prints with the sitcom-like theme song and the pre-movie preview clip of the film (which was used to pad out these shortish films into a 90 minute or two-hour movie slot on television) rather than the original film credits and the prints are not always razor sharp but still they are very good prints.

This DVD contains the first ten movies in the Blondie series in order of release 1938-1942. Each of these five films are excellent comedies - the early years were the very best ones although I do wish the remaining 18 would have be released in followup sets.  These movies are also available from the manufacturer in seperate sets of five movies, 1938-1940 and 1940-1942, at five dollars each and if you love collectibles get the special Lunch Box edition in which the ten movies and the plastic cases come in a gorgeous Blondie lunch box.",1290988800,,1785,4.788961038961039

2005765,4,B0001JXP2A,"I found this DVD set for an excellent price and it even included a little metal Blondie lunchbox!  For the price, I think it is a bargain although I guess the movies are edited for their syndication run according to other reviews.  They seem long enough to me and, according to the Internet Movie Data Base, they originally ran for just 68 minutes.  In fact, they often drag.  I don't know how they could be longer.  Syndication is how I remember watching these movies when I was a kid.  That quirky tune brought back a lot of memories as did all the running gags like Dagwood running over the mailman on his way to catch the bus every morning.  I also remember Baby Dumpling's hatred for washing dishes, that smart alec next door neighbor kid Alvin, the famous Dagwood sandwiches and, of course, that adorable family dog Daisy.

I do not remember the teaser movie segments at the beginning, though.  They run for about 4 minutes and are annoying (I fast forward through them).  I also do not like how the discs start playing the first movie automatically.  I like the selection screen music and would rather it keep playing until I am ready to watch the film.  I also remembered Blondie as being the bright one, but actually Dagwood and Blondie were both very ditsy.  Blondie was childish and over-sensitive and Dagwood had a violent streak I had forgotten.  He had a seeming ability to knock people out with one blow.  The later episodes are not as good as the earlier ones and the re-watchability isn't very high because they tend to drag.  Still, if you remember watching these movies on television back in the 1980s (in my case) or earlier and just want to go down memory lane, I recommend this set because the price is ""Incredible...Bumsteadable""!  Three stars for the films, extra star for the price.

Disc 1:
""Blondie""--This is a very complicated film.  The plot includes a new furniture set, a wedding anniversary, an unpaid note, a broken vacuum cleaner, a big business deal, a borrowed car, the police, etc.  It really goes all over the place.
""Blondie Meets The Boss""-- This is my favorite Blondie film.  The opening kitchen scenes are very funny.  The Bumsteads are planning their vacation but Mr. Dithers tells Dagwood he has to cancel it, so he resigns.  Blondie goes to meet Dithers to get Dagwood his job back but she is offered the job instead.  Excellent one-liners in this one.
""Blondie Takes A Vacation""--This movie has some heavy moments.  The Bumsteads finally go on vacation and end up helping an elderly couple who run a hotel that a heartless competitor is trying to run out of business.  The competitor's hotel catches fire with Baby Dumpling and Daisy trapped inside.  Oh no!  Poor Daisy!
""Blondie Brings Up Baby""--A salesman convinces Blondie that Baby Dumpling is a genius, so she enrolls him in the third grade.  Waiting for Baby Dumpling outside the school fence, Daisy is caught by the dog catchers.  Baby Dumpling tries to find her and meets a crippled girl who needs the inspiration of a dog and little boy to walk again.
""Blondie on a Budget""--Blondie is very tight with money and won't let Dagwood join a fishing club.  Her ire is up even more when an old flame of Dagwood's (played by Rita Hayworth) comes for a visit.  All sorts of misunderstandings in this one.

Disc 2:
""Blondie Has Servant Trouble""--J.C. Dithers is the executor of an estate claimed to be haunted.  He gives the Bumsteads the use of the mansion (complete with servants) to prove it is not.  One of the servants, though, is a lunatic out for revenge.
""Blondie Plays Cupid""--The Bumsteads go to the country to visit relatives and meet up with a young couple (the fellow played by Glenn Ford) whose plans to elope are thwarted by the girl's angry father.  The father blames his daughter's engineer boyfriend for digging a hole on his property in an unsuccessful attempt to build an oil well.  The Bumsteads help them get married and find oil so, I guess, oils well that ends well (heh, heh).  Strange, Baby Dumpling is referred to as Dagwood Jr. and not Alexander at the end of this film.
""Blondie Goes Latin""--The Bumsteads are invited to accompany J.C. Dithers on a South American cruise (why he would choose the Bumsteads on a cruise for his health is not explained) but Dagwood has to stay home to close a business deal.  In a mix-up that can only happen to Dagwood, he stays on the ship as a drummer in drag.  This is a very silly movie (even by Blondie standards) with too many songs.
""Blondie in Society""--The title of this movie doesn't describe the plot at all.  Dagwood brings home a destructive Great Dane who eats everything, angers the neighbors, and falls asleep during dog shows.  Coincidentally, a big client of J.C. Dither's is after (played by William Frawley) is a lover Great Danes.
""Blondie Goes To College""--This movie doesn't make much sense.  Dagwood and Blondie start college and pretend not to be married.  The plot is not realistic, but it is a ""Blondie"" movie after all.  Blondie is pursued by the captain of the football team and Dagwood catches the eye of a socialite.  Phew, and these are only ten of twenty-eight Blondie films!",1271548800,5,5165,4.676274944567628

2005769,4,B0001JXP2A,"Blondie, Volumes 1 & 2

It is rare for Hollywood to produce films from characters in a daily newspaper comic strip. The ""Blondie"" comic strip began in the early 1930s and is still published after eight decades. Many other comic strips from that time are long gone and forgotten. The comic situations which reflect ordinary realities continue. These films went on for 12 years with 28 films which says the public approved of Hollywood's portrayal of ordinary family life and its stereotypes. The back cover of each package lists the titles with a skimpy description. The two or three films produced each year were all good. Some of the details reflect the times like other films of that era. Have they aged well? Look at the family comedies of today for comparison.

I don't know the reason why Dagwood is portrayed as a bungler and Blondie as all-knowing, but it was acceptable to the audiences. Dagwood is shown as having a private office and the principal assistant to J. C. Dithers, the owner of a construction company. The shaky employment prospects of Dagwood as a white-collar worker must have resonated with the primarily blue-collar audiences. The Bumsteads live in their home, they are not renters in an apartment or tenement. Note how few own a car, the reality for ordinary people in those days when people lived and walked to work and shopping. These films provide a look at life seventy years ago. What did you notice? Note how conflicts over money cause most of the problems. Blondie handles the money and budget, as in many homes today. In real life Dagwood the cost analyst would have done this.

These five films are in Volume 1.

Blondie Meets the Boss (1939)

Dagwood (Arthur Lake) was such a loser that one has to wonder who would hire him or why.  It's never clear exactly what his job is--except coming in late and making gross errors.  Mr. Dithers treats him like an idiot, fires him frequently but keeps rehiring him.  And I have to wonder what Blondie (Penny Singleton) could possibly find attractive in him.  He's incompetent, whiny, deceiving, and unattractive.

Blondie, on the other hand, was the nice mom like Harriet from Ozzie and Harriet.  Her little ruffled apron is always neat and clean and she manages to keep a perfect house, cook wonderful meals, and tend to the children, yet stay perfectly unwrinkled.

The kids are unreal--just too darned cute to be allowed.  And there are racist characters of the Stepin Fetchit ilk.  Both were supposed to be humorous.  I don't find it funny to hear kids say things that adults obviously wrote, and I'm not amused by the ""Yassuhs"" from stumbling black actors.

This is directed by Frank Strayer, and the screenplay was written by the creator of comic strip Chic Young in collaboration with Richard Flournoy. A total of 28 films were produced from 1938 to 1950, with the two leading characters and their young son named Alexander ""Baby Dumpling"" Bumstead (Larry Sims).  This DVD set has 10 movies on two discs; Blondie (1938); Blondie Meets the Boss (1939); Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939); Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939); Blondie on a Budget (1940); Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940); Blondie Plays Cupid (1940); Blondie Goes Latin (1941); Blondie in Society (1941); and Blondie Goes to College (1942). The series regulars also include; Daisy, the dog, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Dithers, Danny Mummert as next door boy genius, Alvin Fuddle; and Irving Bacon as the postman.

""Blondie"" is the series opener in which Blondie plans a surprise anniversary party with new living room furniture as a gift to Dagwood, while Dagwood goes to meet the firm's client at his hotel. In the motel he meets a janitor named Clarence ""CP"" Percival (Gene Lockhart) and his daughter Elsie (Ann Doran), and ends up fixing his vacuum cleaner, and forgetting the reason of his visit. Soon Blondie finds out about this and suspects he is having an affair. Blondie, in the company of her mother Mrs. Miller (Kathleen Lockhart) and sister Dot (Dorothy Moore) gets Dagwood do some real convincing about their suspicion. As seen on the comic strip, Dithers fires Dagwood in this episode and many more times in later episodes of the series.

In ""Blondie Meets the Boss"" when Bumsteads are looking for their much anticipated  vacation, Dithers informs Dagwood that he is needed at the office until Dithers settles a construction deal in Washington D,C. Dagwood upset over the plan resigns, and Blondie finds herself hired to take Dagwood's place. Meanwhile Blondie's visiting sister, Dot (Dorothy Moore) and her boyfriend Freddie (Joel Dean) are in town participate in upcoming dance contest. The spoofs include; Blondie suspecting Dagwood of his infidelity after seeing a picture of him with a female singer of a club, and he ends up dancing with Dot in the contest. Both Blondie and Dagwood, unknowingly screw up Dithers business deal, which eventually turns out be beneficial to the company.

In ""Blondie takes a vacation,"" the Bumsteads get into trouble on the train with a passenger named Harvey Morton (Donald MacBride) who gets irritated by barking Daisy. Upon their arrival at their vacation motel, Blondie and Dagwood are refused accommodations by the manager, who is none other than Mr. Morton.  They find another motel run by an elderly couple who are in the middle of a fiscal crisis. When Bumsteads comes to know that Morton is behind this problem, they offer to help with Dagwood as the manager, Blondie as the hostess, and Baby Dumpling with the dirty dishes.

In ""Blondie brings up baby,"" Dagwood gets fired after bungling a business deal. Baby Dumpling is enrolled in school, which makes Blondie restless with her son away from home. In the meanwhile Daisy is caught by dog catchers and sent to the pound where she is adopted by a wealthy family living at an Estate. Then Baby Dumpling skips school and goes looking for Daisy, and worried Bumsteads call police thinking that their son is lost. Meanwhile the estate reports to the police that their wheel chair bound daughter has been kidnapped. While Dagwood is around the estate looking for Baby Dumpling, the family estate calls police thinking he is the kidnapper, and he ends up in jail. Blondie confused with situation thinks that Dagwood is missing too.

""Blondie on Budget"" is an episode in which Rita Hayworth stars as Joan Forrester who has some business with Dagwood. While on their way, her car breakdown and Dagwood spend the afternoon at the movies until the car is repaired. While at the theater, Dagwood enters a raffle, which he wins, and he decides to surprise Blondie with a fur coat she wanted to buy. Blondie sees Joan with Dagwood at the department store and misunderstands situation. She packs up her belongings, leaves a ""Dear John"" letter for Dagwood, and takes Baby Dumpling with her to file for a divorce. The spoofs of the show include a hilarious phone conversation between Marvin Williams (Don Beddoe), the next door neighbor impersonating as Dagwood, with Blondie, when she is under the impression that Dagwood is fishing at a lake with Marvin.

In ""Blondie has Servant trouble,"" Bumsteads offer to spend a weekend in a haunted house to prove to one of Dither's clients that the haunting is false. This show is appropriate for Halloween time as there are spooky instances. On the rainy night Dagwood greet a couple, Eric and Hannah Vaughn (Arthur Hohl and Esther Dale), a middle-aged couple whom the Bumsteads believe are servants. Strange things start to happen after the servants start working at the house. Clothing in the closet disappears, and Dagwood getting a flashlight stuck in his mouth when it is dark, Daisy gets shivers in due to fright. In addition to this, Bumsteads have to deal with a black man named Horatio (Ray Turner) who is staying at the house to get initiated into a club, also disappears in the night mysteriously, and reappears again. This is not only spooky but a lot of fun to watch.

""Blondie Plays Cupid"" is a hilarious episode, when the Bumsteads take a family break for the July 4 weekend to spend time with Blondie's aunt Hannah (Leona Roberts) and uncle Abner (Spencer Charters) at their farm. Dagwood nearly misses the train while the Bumsteads end up on the express train to Kingsley which is 72 miles from their destination. As the Bumsteads walk in the middle of nowhere; they are soon picked up by an eloping couple, Charlie Collins and Millie Tucker (Glenn Ford and Luana Walters), who are on their way to get married. Later when marriage ceremony is interrupted by the bride's father (Will Wright) with a shotgun, Blondie hatches a plan to get the two lovers back together again. When Dagwood climbs a ladder to get Millie from her room, he enters the wrong window and comes face to face with the old man and his shotgun!

In ""Blondie Goes Latin,"" Mr. Dithers takes Bumsteads on a cruise trip to South America. Before their departure a business call keeps Dagwood behind to attend an important meeting.  As luck would have it, Dagwood could not leave the ship in time, and instead he ends up as a member of the ship's music band. He masquerades in a drag dress as a lady drummer and entertains the passengers of the ship, and misadventures follow wherever Dagwood goes. Penny Singleton sings three songs in this movie.

In ""Blondie in society,"" Dagwood buys himself a Great Dane to cover a $50 debt, and Blondie enters him in a dog show. To everyone's surprise the dog wins the contest and previous owner wants the dog back which results in a big fight between Bumsteads and prior owner.  Penny Singleton sings two songs in this episode. Daisy and Chin-up (Great Dane) provide entertainment doing some doggie tricks.

In ""Blondie Goes to College,"" both Dagwood and Blondie enroll as students in a local college leaving Baby Dumpling at a military school. While at the college, they pose as unmarried friends; thus Blondie becomes a love interest of the college football hero, Rusty Bryant (Larry Parks), and Dagwood is romanced by pretty co-ed Laura Wadsworth (Janet Blair). The situation is perfect for another great screwball slapstick, which also casts two other well known actors; Lloyd Bridges as one of the students, named Ben Dixon; and Adele Mara as Babs.

This DVD set with 10 movies is a steal for what it is priced at, and the amount of fun and entertainment you get to enjoy; highly recommended to all fans.",1191196800,40,7922,4.8483727810650885
2005781,5,B0001JXP2A,"Not that many years ago, Blondie movies were on every Sunday.  Unfortunately, so much has been taken off the air and replaced with garbage...so it is VERY NICE to be able to buy DVD's like the Blondie movies.  They are as when we use to watch them on those Sundays. Great family movies, or great for a quiet weekend to remember when true entertainment was on TV.  Cute, light, & fun.

2005783,5,B0001JXP2A,"This 2-DVD set of 10 black & white movies bring back fond memories from my childhood in the 1960's when I discovered them as reruns on television. They are a good adaptation of the newspaper comic strip. This collection consists of the earlier films with Baby Dumpling as Baby Dumpling, before he becomes known as Alexander, and has a sister. My only criticism of the product is that each movie is prefaced with a preview, which is unnecessary and a little annoying.",1182816000,2,466,4.695121951219512
2005784,5,B0001JXP2A,Blondie Vol. 1 and 2 were wonderful!  Not only made me laugh but brought me back to my childhood when I used to watch them on TV!  If you are young at heart....and love the old sense of humor....this is definitely for you!,1168300800,3,222,4.1395348837209305
2005785,4,B0001JXP2A,"I paid $4.88 for each volume of this set because I really wanted to see the Blondie films.  When I was younger they only ever played in the middle of the night if at all. I wasn't expecting much from the set given the label that put them out and the fact that a DVD under $5 is usually not worth the money.  Also, the packaging said it was a TV Series and the total running time of the set was 72 minutes.

Having said that, I still give it 4 stars because it really is the Blondie movies and the quality of sound and picture are great.  Unfortunately they chop off the end credits but the movie is over by then so that's okay.  The stars of these films are really Baby Dumpling and Daisy but Dagwood and Blondie have their moments.  The only drawback is that there's only 10 of the 28 issued films!

I took off one star for the chopped ending and the fact that at the beginning of each movie you get a preview for a scene in the movie and that makes you think you've missed something.  Just fast forward through that and you're good to go.  My kids got a hoot out of Blondie Takes A Vacation and they want to see more.

You won't be disappointed.  Hopefully a restored box set will come out or at least a volume 3, 4, and 5 so we can get the remaining features.",1146355200,27,1262,4.048387096774194
2005786,3,B0001JXP2A,"Say what you will about the dupe quality, superimposed ID logo, etc. but these are NOT the original Blondie films as seen in theatres.

In reality, these are butchered versions from a mid-Sixties syndication package, apparently edited down to fit into one-hour TV time slots. The original Columbia Pictures titles have been deleted and replaced with an idiotic jingle and credits, plots seem to pick up in mid-scene several minutes after the original film actually began, and in several cases, key sequences appear to have been excised, resulting in baffling continuity gaps.

That said, Platinum packaging identifies these condensations as ""episodes,"" not movies--and the company is merely re-releasing an abomination, not committing one.  And, c'mon, what do you expect for $6?

Even in this chopped-up form, this rarely-seen series is still a lot of fun. The antics of Baby Dumpling, the dog and the neighbor kid are worth the price alone.",1140134400,31,942,5.218543046357616
2005787,5,B0001JXP2A,"One of the downfalls of cable TV is that the sort of black and white shows that stations used to broadcast on Sunday afternoons aren't on anymore. One reason for that, of course, is that film stock is very volatile, and it's only Ted Turner's efforts to preserve them that has resulted in so many great films on Turner Classic Movies, and now luckily making their way to DVD.

This is not one of those carefully restored films, and the complaints about Platinum Disc Corporation's DVDs are valid. Having said that, if you're not a purist, you'll probably greatly enjoy these films, originally run by King Features as the Blondie show. Here are ten episodes on two discs in a box set at a fantastically low price. I remember having seen a Blondie show and was very excited to get this set from Amazon, but I thought it couldn't be as good as I remembered it. I was wrong. It's better. This is one of the best black and white era shows. Penny Singleton brings Chic Young's comic to life, but Arthur Lake is also amazing as Dagwood.

These shows start with a preview which often gives away the show. Good time to make a sandwich (a Dagwood) before the opening titles come on. Platinum's versions are clearly not like the upscale Criterion Collection, but look at the price difference. I've found many enjoyable films in their inexpensive comedy collections I would otherwise never have discovered, the sort of thing they used to show on Sunday afternoons. Until Ted or someone restores these films, thanks to Platinum for Blondie.",1134345600,73,1527,4.672862453531598
