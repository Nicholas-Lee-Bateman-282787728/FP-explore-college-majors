8433783,5,B003AHKLL8,"Ok I've been trying to figure out the Turks head knot from books, the internet, you tube etc.
Robert Blacks videos are like having a personal mentor teaching you how to do it. What tools you need to get started, what kind of leather or cord  and a slow step by step visual on how it is done.
I suggest you get his Decorative Knots and Braiding Disk one and Disk two. That will be all you need to start making beautiful braided leather projects incorporating The Turks head knot that confounded me for months.  Thanks Robert for sharing your knowledge in an understandable way for a newbie.
