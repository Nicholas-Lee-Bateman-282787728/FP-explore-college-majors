1818071,5,B00007KK56,"Why oh why do they release the entire season of a piece of garbage like ""Sports Night"" (which Al would hate), and they only give us a few episodes of MWC????
I DONT GET IT????
This show helped build Fox...and what do we get in return????
We get a Full Season of Malcolm in the Middle,Sports Night,and freaking MAD ABOUT YOU????Whats next - The Complete ""Thirty Something"" Box Set?????CMON!!!!
I guess its a step in the right direction - but why they refuse to recognoze this show for the groundbreaker that it was - and give it the respect its due - is beyond me.
What next?A ""Dr Quinn Medicine Woman"" compilation?Or perhaps ""Cop Rock.""

1818072,2,B00007KK56,"When I first recieved word that Columbia/Tri-Star was releasing ""Married...With Children"" on DVD, I was overjoyed.  Finally, my favourite sitcom was getting the treatment it deserved.  This was until I found out about two weeks later exactly what capacity they were releasing the show in.  Instead of releasing this classic series in the form of season sets, what we have here is a so-called ""greatest hits"" compilation containing what are apparently the ""most outrageous episodes"".  I have no clue what they're trying to pull, but true fans of the show demand MORE.  This is a joke.  As an above viewer stated, you have shows like ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" which is released in full season sets.  Even ""The Larry Sanders Show"" has a first season on DVD for god sakes.
On a notorious website, there is a poll asking everyday people what series' should be made available in season sets on DVD.  MYC was in the TOP 10.  If anything Columbia/Tri-Star are going to lose money on this piece of garbage, because we all know that the show deserves better treatment.  Furthermore, the fans of the show deserve better.  They need to wake up and smell the toast.",1040342400,10,1153,4.7727272727272725
1818073,1,B00007KK56,"This is a disgrace to a great show. There are so many ""bad"" shows out there that have boxed set. This show, it's actors and it's fans, deserves much better treatment than this. Please do not support this stupid decision by Fox, by buying these ""outrageous episodes"". It's a darn fine show, arguably one of the best ever, but a ""bad"" DVD set.",1039996800,6,341,4.428571428571429
1818074,4,B00007KK56,"I've been waiting for a DVD release of ""Married...With Children"" for years and now that I've heard of this upcoming release I gotta say I feel cheated.  For a show that literally started the FOX network and put it on the map, a show that broke all the rules and paved the way for many other shows such as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Roseanne,"" and lasted 10 years with 11 seasons, for Columbia TriStar to only offer 'Best of' collections as opposed to seasonal sets is a travesty.  I mean, it's not like 'Best of' collections is all Columbia TriStar offers for their television library, they've released seasonal sets of ""All in the Family,"" ""Sanford and Son,"" and even god forbid ""Mad About You,"" so what the hell are they thinking here?  However, its good to at least get something for now, and this DVD does offer the classic lost episode ""I'll See You in Court,"" which never aired once in the US until just this past year on cable network FX.  So I will buy this release, and hopefully we'll be seeing The Complete First Season released sometime in the near future.",1039824000,12,1061,4.510416666666667
1818075,3,B00007KK56,"What the hell is ""outrageous episodes vol. 1"" supposed to mean? Since when are only SOME of the episodes of this magnificent show supposed to be outrageous?
This is a seriously bad treatment of a classic - to release a small subset of the real show is not only ridiculous, but an insult to its fanbase. MWC deserves to have all of its episodes (well.. the first six seasons anyway) released, instead of having the suits decide what goes on the dvd based on how much controversy the episode originally generated.
Married... With Children is a classic show that keeps getting hosed. It began with Fox treating it like any other show (not THE show that skyrocketed them to fame), followed by a series of events, not the least of which was pulling the plug on the series without even notifying the actors. Needless to say, this is the latest insult - a ""greatest hits"" ""ensemble"".
MWC was one of a kind. The original six seasons had what I can only describe as genius writers, combining hilarious observations with biting critique. Every character had philosophy that made them different and unique - like Al's constant tales about the ""Red Grinch that stole Uncle Al's life"", or Kelly's opinion on the usage of the word 'hussy'. Even Marcy, character I personally like the least had her charm, whether it was her El Pollo Loco disposition, or strange, borderline explosive libido.
This show deserves better. It deserves to have more than 3 items show up in the Amazon.com search (one of which is a book). Both Fox (especially Fox) and Columbia/TriStar owe it to the show's fans to release a decent, comprehensive collection, not just an insulting collection of episodes that will only satisfy the casual viewer. For fudge's sake - if something idiotic like Buffy the Vampire Slayer can have a DVD collection (and it's still running!) the show that single-handedly created the Fox network should've had it years ago.
As for myself, I'm not planning on buying this - I will wait until a comprehensive collection. Even if it means watching FX til the cows come home. 5 Stars because it's the best show ever, -2 stars for the crappy treatment it keeps receiving.",1039478400,26,2155,4.764705882352941

1818080,4,B00007KK56,"The infamous episode ""I'll See You In Court"" is on this one...it is the one deemed ""too raunchy"" for national TV...synopsis is the Bndys and the Rhoades secretly videotaped in their intimate moments in a hotel room..I believe my favorite had to be the two-parter about the air conditioner (or lack thereof) that forces the Bundys to end up squatting in a supermarket to stay cool after Al's mishap with a cheap lowgrade ac unit causes a power-out in the neighborhood so they move to the grocery store til the heat dies down (no pun intended.) When the gig is up they become the millionth shopper eligible to win a $1000 free grocery spree but Marcy thinks Al cut in front of her in the checkout line so she and her husband (the second, not the conservative mensch Steve) compete against them.
In No Chicken No Check, Kelly and Bud decide to go into the cost of a car together they get a deal on auto insurance by registering it as a farm vehicle) but their intended goals clash because Bud is trying to get some poon and he's got a Russian beauty on a hot date and of course hilarity ensues! In a Dump of My Own Al  puts his plans into action to build his own personal bathroom but finds his plans derailed by Peggy...Jerry Mathers guest stars in the supermarket-squatting double episode...Kelly and Bud manage to heckle the Beaver while their parents are duking it out with Marcy and Jefferson.
For what it is worth..this is a breezy and fun dvd to kill time...a funny family that proves once again that father does not always know best:-)",1424822400,,1540,4.5

1818082,5,B00007KK56,"The Cleavers they ain't, but this show is way funnier than anything you'd see on TV today that can be classified as ""comedy""-that is why I return to this one from time to time...Peggy's hair looked great back then-not as flamboyant as the later seasons. So did Kelly's--she is really platinum looking here and Bud is clean-cut prior to the mullet days of the early '90s. Steve and Marcy's comically intrusive ways never get old to me; I kind of yearn for a time when ""nosy neighbors' could be looked at as a good thing.  Lots of acerbic wit and dialogue between family members, the way the Bundys and the Rhoades banter with each other in different scenarios. It's a shame that in the entertainment world everything seems to be either dark, violent, or otherwise obsessed with the supernatural, or so push-the-envelope crude, and disgusting that nothing is shocking anymore.

Sometimes you just want to have a good laugh when it comes to TV viewing-not be grossed out or subjected to heavy-handed interpretations on whether or not we can talk to ghosts.

1818092,2,B00007KK56,"The show that became near and dear to my old and crusty heart starts with season 2. In S1 Al is talking in a weird, forced way (I think Ed was ""triiiin ta speak sha-KA-GUH"" and not pulling it off, they should have hired the late Dennis Ferrina as a voice coach: THAT man was the real deal!), Peg actually seemed to care about Al and the kids, Kelly isn't stupid yet, and Bud...Bud is just an annoying little pipsqueak. Steve and Marcy have arrived fully in their characters and have some of the best lines, but really this season is a generous 2 1/2 stars as far as entertainment goes. For $7 it's isn't a complete waste of money, but I cannot imagine anyone but the fanatics (like whomever is still watching The Simpsons and South Park as they ache painfully along in the twilight world of lost relevance) watching these episodes more then once a decade. This DVD is a Mill Creek production and they cheaped out and crammed 13 episodes on a single disc via the unholy magic of 1980s 240 resolution. If you are a real fan and I haven't convinced you otherwise, find the Columbia 2 disc set at 480p at a used store because the video quality of this low-rent product is distracting it is so poor.",1400976000,,1194,4.358744394618834

Not to forget Kelly who will broad side you right out of left field with the bumb blondski personality that only she can do. Precious.
Peggy is so predictable and Bud an on going go between of unpredictable laughter.

1818109,3,B00007KK56,"Just what the title says, this disc only gives you technically five episodes, but since one is a two-parter, it is actually only four. But I got it for only five dollars, so I can't complain too much.

This disc gives the observant viewer a good back-to-back display of the show's jump, from its days as a genuinely funny show to the parody of itself it later became. Don't get me wrong, all five episodes included here are very funny, but sometime in 1990, it derailed, and never fully came back. The two-parter is from 1991, and there is a marked decrease in the quality of the writing and directing in it. In fact, I can pin-point the moment the show derailed. It was the one where the two families went to England, on a bogus prize vacation. That episode isn't on this particular disc, but following the show's run, how it played out, that is precisely when it lost it.

I may start getting the seasons as available on Amazon, although I may stop after the third or fourth season. But, completionist I am, I will probably keep getting them, as finances allow.

Back to the product at hand. There isn't really anything in this disc that separates it, it is a so-so depiction of a show that itself could, and should be a whole lot better.",1237852800,2,1240,4.4298245614035086

1818113,5,B00007KK56,"Meet The Bundy's! a very dysfunctional family with Al (Ed O'Neil) whom is an incompetent slacker who's job is working in a shoe store. His wife Peg (Kathy Sagal) is your typical houseworking mother who happens to be a Couch Potato just like her husband and they have two children known as Bud (David Faustino) who is a horny kid and the gorgeous but airheaded blonde sister Kelly (Christina Applegate). They have many adventures through life as it gets tough on them even with the happy go lucky neighbors like the married couple Marcy (Amanda Bearse) and Steve(David Garrison) help out sometimes even to prove that the family is very dysfuctional in every way.

This show is one of the most influential and funniest TV shows in history! ever since it's debut on Fox in 1987 it became one of the raunchiest TV shows to hit the small screen. It broke tabboos yet it found great success which was different from any ""Perfect"" family sitcom. Here the family are a bunch of nitwits that are basically the family that stays together don't pay together, the characters are likable and the jokes are risque but funny, there's even the memorable ""Love and Marriege"" theme song by Frank Sinatra.

This DVD contains the first 13 episodes all remastered and on DVD here in this boxset. The episodes contain ""The Pilot"" where Al wanted to go to a basketball game is force to have dinner with the neighbors, ""Thinergy"" deals with Peg wanting to go on a special diet. ""Sixteen Years and What Do you Get"" where Al doesn't get the Anniversary present that wanted to get for Peg, ""But i Didn't shoot the Deputy"" has Al buying a gun for protecting then one night he shoots his neighbor's dog by accident as he feels guilty. ""Have you Driven a Ford Lately?"" is about Al getting the perfect car, ""Whose Room is it Anyway?"" has the neighbors going ape-crap over room addition. ""Al Loses His Cherry"" has him after an argument he gets seduced by a hot blonde bimbo, ""Peggy Sue Got Work"" when Al doesn't buy to buy a new VCR, she gets a job in a department store for money so she can get that new VCR. ""Married...Without Children"" deals with Al and Peg going away for the weekend as Marcy with Steve baby-sit the kids, ""The Poker Game"" has Steve being a jackass by using his mortage Payment Money in a poker game, ""Where's the Boss"" deals with Al thinking his boss has kicked the bucket as he threatens to quit his job but later discovers the truth. "" Nightmare on Al's Street"" has Marcy who's husband goes out for the week in a business trip she starts having bizarre dreams of Al and finally ""Johnny B. Gone"" has Al's favorite Hamburger restraunt closing down.

The DVDs give a nice transfer with extras like trailers and the ""Married with Children"" reunion special, a highly recommended program.",1231200000,,2774,4.588709677419355
1818114,2,B00007KK56,The first episodes were truly bad. But the writers got better with time. By episode 5 things got to where I remembered they had to be. Good comedy,1226966400,,146,4.25
1818115,5,B00007KK56,"Some TV series take a while before they find their stride, but Married...With Children does great at having a real funny first season. There are a lot of moments from this season that had me laughing out loud a lot. One of my favorite moments from the first season is when Al shoots Marcy and Steve's new dog and Steve has to describe how he knows the dog is dead. Hear Al shout ""Freeze creep!"" is hilarious on its own.

What makes this season so interesting is that it has a different take on their daughter Kelly. She isn't as dumb as she eventually becomes, and is more like a spoiled brat. It being only 13 episodes is the only downside about this DVD. You can watch the entire season in one sitting, I almost did. It is very addictive and you will find the season over real fast. So, I highly recommend this DVD and I would also recommend you buy the rest of the series that is out so far. Once you get finished watching this season, you are going to want more and it only gets better from here!",1217548800,,1000,4.208333333333333
1818116,3,B00007KK56,"Married With Children was my favourite show as a kid and today would still rate in my top five of all time.  My rating of this first season DVD is not of the show itself by any means, it is of the poor overall DVD package.  We fans deserve better than what those who owned the rights to this show have delivered.  They rely on the fact that this show has a huge fan base and that we will buy this DVD regardless of the fact that it comes with no commentaries or any special features except for the Married With Children Reunion Special which was filmed a substantial number of years before this was put on DVD I might add.  We also only get half of that special anyway, David Garrison (who played Steve) tells us we'll be right back after the break only that is when it ends, they don't come back at all.  You can't help but feel a little bit, well a lot ripped off!

How hard of expensive would it have been to grab at least one of the actors for each episode to commentate with some behind the scenes person as well? I don't think I've even watched a DVD with a TV show's pilot that doesn't at least have commentary for that episode. It would not have cost or taken much time but those who owned the rights couldn't be bothered.  For shame! Viewers might as well have taped these when they aired on TV and watch them on your old video player as there's no advantage to owning the DVD.

Season one aired with 13 episodes and even though most classic Bundy moments come from later seasons, season one is certainly worth watching.  In season one most of the on air time revolved around Al and Peggy and to a lesser degree their newly wed neighbours Steve and Marcy.  Bud and Kelly are of course here but obviously being younger child actors they didn't appear much so there characters aren't as well developed as they will be in later seasons.  Bud even has friends in this season and is certainly a lot cooler than he will be as he gets older and even Kelly isn't as bimboish as she will later become.  Other aspects of the Bundy life that will change in future seasons are that the Bundys have food in the house, Al is not interested in sleeping with other women when given the opportunity and there are also other staff at the shoe store who will change in future seasons.  There are classic lines such as in the pilot Al telling Steve if I wanted people to know what I was thinking, I'd be talking to them"".

Hopefully with future seasons those who own the rights give a bit more respect to the show which boldly turned TV on its head in an era of the what did we learn today family shows. It pioneered the way for later dysfunctional family shows such as The Simpsons, Roseanne, Malcolm in the Middle and My Name is Earl and much more respect should given to this great important in TV history show when putting it on DVD!",1209254400,,2826,4.257943925233645

1818120,5,B00007KK56,"One of the greatest sitcoms in T.V. history, ""Married...With Children"" lives on through DVD releases (the 5th Season is the most recent releases); Here we have the first season which first introduced the infamous Bundy clan.

They are:

1. Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill)-Father, shoe salesmen, who despises his wife, his kids, and his life.

2. Peg Bundy (Katey Segal)-Mother, unemployed. Despises her husband, loves her T.V.

3. Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate)-Daughter, alleged slut. Really stupid and hates her family.

4. Bud Bundy (David Faustino)-Son. Smartest member of family.

And their next door neighbors Marcy (Amanda Bearse) and Steve (David Garrison) who hate the family...The feelings mutual. Chances are you know all that stuff by now. Anyway, this first season is first rate. The episodes itself, I'm not referring to the bonus features. All episodes are great (some are better than others though), the picture and sound quality is great...Any fan of Married With Children should be quite pleased. Here's the episodes and some comments:

1. Pilot-The pilot episode is great. It introduces the Bundy  family and the neighbors Marcie and Steve nicely. It's hilarious.

2. Thinergy-Another great episode, although they're still spending time on character development.

3. Sixteen Years and What Do You Get-Has some great one-liners, but it's not one of my favorite episodes.

4. But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy-Very funny. Al accidentally shoots Marcie's dog. Priceless episode.

5. Have You Driven a Ford Lately?-Saying this is funny is pointless. They're all funny. This one, however, is hysterical.

6. Whose Room is it Anyway?-Another great episode involving Marcie and Steve's plans to build an extra room and Al & Peg trying to sway each of them to what kind of room it shall be.

7. Al Loses His Cherry-Totally cool episode, don't mistake the innuendo in the title for what you're no doubt thinking.

8. Peggy Sue Got Work-Peg gets a job. This is one of the funniest episodes. Although, they're all funny.

9. Married...Without Children-I think it ended to abruptly, but other than that...This episode is great.

10. The Poker Game-I can't say anything about this episode, I didn't say about the others. It's absolutely hilarious!

11. Where's the Boss-This episode has some of the best (and highest number of) one-liners. The stupid security guard is classic.

12. Nightmare on Al's Street-One of the greatest lines in MWC history. ""I'm horny Al, what are you going to do about it?""

13. Johnny B. Gone-This episode is not one of the best on here.

1818121,5,B00007KK56,"I just finished watching the Married...With Children Season 1 DVD set.  And honestly, it has to be the funniest show ever to air on TV.  Or, at least one of the funniest.  I would say the top ones are Futurama, Family Guy (the original 4 seasons), and the Simpsons (the original episodes).  What do all of these shows have in common?  They are all comedy sitcoms.  Al Bundy is the classic get-rich quick guy, who will verbally scorn anyone, but loves them dearly.  I wish this show was still produced.  Actually, no I don't.  Because  it would probably go the way of the new Family Guy's (nowhere).",1158796800,,598,4.5046728971962615

1818125,5,B00007KK56,"The most memorable episode on this DVD is ""I'll See You In Court"" from Married...With Children's third season(1988-89). Al(Ed O'Neill) and Peggy Bundy(Katey Sagal) retreat to a motel to try to ""put some spice"" back into their private life. They view a videocassette,recorded by a security camera,of their next-door neighbors Steve(David Garrison) and Marcy Rhoades(Amanda Bearse) engaged in a private escapade. It turns out that the camera violated the Rhoadeses' privacy,when they were at that same motel by themselves at an earlier time. So both couples sue the owners/operators of the motel but only the Rhoadeses were awarded a nice $100 grand because the Bundys' privacy was not invaded afterall. After the trial,Al and Peggy are making love underneath the presiding judge's podium with a security camera overhead! This episode was never aired on the Fox network during its original run because because of some of its content. The FX channel did once air it in 2002,though. In ""You Better Shop Around"",a two-part episode from 1990-91,Al,Peg and their children Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(David Faustino) seek relaxing shelter in a supermarket. Al accidentally wins a sweepstakes by becoming the store one millionth customer of the day. At the time,Al steps ahead of Marcy in the checkout line because he only had a pack of chewing gum. Balloons and confetti are falling and Marcy is bitching because she was originally the next in line. Al quipps,""What's the difference? You still are!"". Al checks out a headline on the cover of the National Enquirer which reads ""Steve Rhoades to marry Cher"". That immediately caught Marcy's attention because he's her ex-husband(this was after Marcy married her second husband Jefferson D'Arcy). The other episodes are awesome. This is a must for every MWC fan.",1132790400,2,1808,5.259515570934256

Okay, on to the DVD's, the eps screen quality is sorta dissapointing, I would've thought they'd clean it up a little but they don't look that bad, just as good as anything you'd catch on F/X which is good enough for me.

The Special Features are the real let down, with a bunch of trailers that are barely related to the show(one for the Sweetest Thing with Christina Applegate, the other only related by network for the quickly cancelled A Minute w/Stan Hooper.  The only payback is the reunion special that aired on fox is also on this set, so thats good, but I was craving some commentaries and deleted scenes, or atleast bloopers but oh well.)

Anyway, don't let that ruin the DVD's for you, because the series is still great and worth the 20 bucks if you are just getting into the show.",1116028800,6,1008,4.427027027027027
1818129,5,B00007KK56,"First premiering in April 1987, Married With Children became a staple of the growing Fox Network's original prime time programming, paving the way for further original creations such as The Simpsons. The total opposite of what a TV family should be, the original working title for the show was Not The Cosbys (a reference to the perfect family atmosphere of the popular 80's sitcom The Cosby Show). Paving the way for ABC's Roseanne, Married With Children more than lived up to its working title, chronicling the pathetic life of a Chicago shoe salesman and his equally dysfunctional family...

Married With Children follows the exploits of the Bundy family, a dysfunctional trailer-park trash family living in American suburbia. The family is headed by Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), a shoe salesman who's lewd, crude, sarcastic, and completely dissatisfied with his life as a loser. Al's wife Peg (Katey Sagal) spends her days watching Oprah and spending what little money Al brings home (she's also Al's greatest source of annoyance). Al and Peg's lives are complicated by their children, Kelly (Christina Applegate), a beautiful yet stupid teenager, and Bud (David Faustino), a sex-starved adolescent. With neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse), and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) dropping in on a regular basis, Al's dreams of a normal family life or a spare moment to relax are continually interrupted by the tortuous reality of his mediocre existence...

The Married With Children (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series pilot in which Peg and Al, worried because they have no friends of their own, meet the new neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhoades. Steve and Marcy have the perfect marriage, but the bad influences of the Bundys conspire to turn them against each other... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Whose Room is It Anyway?"" in which Steve and Marcy decide to add a new room onto their house while Peg and Al pit the couple against each other in order to serve their own selfish interests, and ""Peggy Sue Got Work"" in which Al's refusal to buy Peg the VCR she wants prompts her to get a job in a local department store...

Below is a list of episodes included on the Married With Children (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 1 (Pilot)

Episode 2 (Thinnergy)

Episode 3 (But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy)

Not necessarily a ""bad"" DVD or a ""waste of money"" per se, this was intended to gauge customer response. If response was great, more DVDs (and season sets) were to follow. I guess we can safely say that response was DAMN great! Aside from picture quality issues (I'm not gonna say it's great, I ain't gonna say it ain't), the subsequent season sets were quite great!

1818132,5,B00007KK56,"I have never seen Married.. with children until I catched an episode in syndicating in the mid-90s, and let me tell you I was hooked since that moment, the Bundy feels so familiar and funny and each joke made me laugh like crazy.

Season 1 stared in 1987 as a season-replacement show, with 13 episode, in a network which at that time was kinda of new and maybe this aspect let the show creaters use a lot of jokes and situations that were ricky at the time.

During this season each caracther is trying to find her/his rythm, so it seems slow at times but anyway you find very funny and riske.

If you are new to this show (where have you been!!) this is an excellent way to taste the show, since I am not very into details I really liked that the 13 episodes are in olny two discs so I do not to change discs every 6 episodes, just put one on an enjoy 9 shows in a row!!

I have recently purchased both the 1st and 2nd season and am getting nervous they may not make follow up season and the best is yet to come!

1818135,5,B00007KK56,"The first season was produced in 1987 (it's almost 20 years now!). It included 13 fabulous series.

I didn't have an intention to buy all seasons, and I wouldn't mind to have just the best of... But lately I discovered the complete first season on a DVD, and I decided to have just only this one! I thought, that since that was a beginning in a series of spectacular seasons, then it should have been definitely one of the best. Because lots of energies and efforts were given both by actors and the authors to make this new show popular so that it could win its audience in the late 80th. I bought this DVD and I am very happy about it. I enjoyed each single scene, each phrase and each pulled face. And I laughed a lot! This season is packed with 100% smart and witty jokes that worth to remember and cite!

Quality of the picture is just alright for 1987. I am glad it was not digitally re-mastered, otherwise it would lose the touch and the charm of the late 80th. Besides, re-mastering of a 302-minute show would make this DVD cost a fortune!

On the other hand, the quality of DVD's sound, which is Stereo Dolby Digital, is superb. First time I watched this show on TV dubbed in Russian and I couldn't really assess sound quality of original dialogues. But now, after I bought this DVD, I can tell you - sound is just great. All actors speak clearly and loud enough for one to hear each single word.... and to laugh!

It is so hard to pick a favorite episode, I would have a problem listing my 10 favorites. Married with Children was the best show ever made. It was not expected to be much of a show at all, I read that Ed O'Neil {Al} said that the show would be cancelled by the sixth show. I wonder what he thought when it went past six years? MWC is awesome, the Bundys are hilarious. The Bundys were the original disfunctional family. The kids are starving, the wife is lazy and the husband hates sex with the wife. The neighbors are perverts. No wonder they origannly wanted to call it ""Not the Cosbys."" Before MWC all T.V. shows were family orientated. The Bundys never remember birthdays,even Peg who gave birth. They do not vote or celebrate traditional holidays, they don't go to church, they have all been arrested. The true low class trailer trash family with a twist. Like Peg said.. ""Hey, we're Bundys, we don't call the police, people call them on us."" They have family rumbles on the freeway, in a park, at the movies, that's the Bundy way.

The Married ... With Children show did get a lot better once Steve was gone and Jefferson came into the picture, but these are still classic, great episodes.  You can tell these are the early days for Al seems a lot more affectionate towards Peggy and Peggy seems more loving to Bud and Kelly but they are still funny, especially when they do go off and insult each other.

So get ready for those outrageous Bundys in Married...with Children:The Complete First Season, featuring all 13 episodes from the show's debut. Though the funniest episodes are yet to come in the second season, season 1 is the groundbreaking season that completely changed sitcoms forever. This taboo-shattering hit series was often deamed too hot for TV, introducing everyone's favorite dysfunctional house hold. These are the 13 episodes:
1. Pilot-Peg forces Al to forfeit his coveted basketball game to have dinner with their annoying new neighbors, Steve and Marcy.
2. Thinergy-Hoping to rekindle Al's flame, Peg takes Marcy's advice and goes on a crash diet, much to Al's dislike.
3. Sixteen Years And What Do You Get?-After Peg runs his credit card to the max, Al is forced to show up at his own wedding anniversary empty-handed.
4. But I Didn't Shoot The Deputy-Mistaking it for a burgler, Al accidentally shoots his neighbor's watchdog.
5. Have You Driven A Ford Lately?-After restoring a vintage Mustang, Al discovers the backseat isn't the only thing ""hot"" about his cherry ride.
6. Whose Room Is It Anyway?-A battle between Al and Peg is waged over who has the final word on the neighbor's room addition.
7. Al Loses His Cherry-After a bad fight, Al vows to teach Peg a lesson by not coming home all night. Instead he's the one who ends up getting schooled by a blonde bombshell.
8. Peggy Sue Got Work-When Al refuses to buy Peg a new VCR, Marcy convinces her to get a job herself.(laughs)
9. Married...Without Children-When Al and Peg get away for the weekend, Marcy and Steve volunteer to baby-sit Bud and Kelly-but get more than they bargained for.
10. The Poker Game-When Steve sits in on a Friday-night poker game, he loses more than his shirt to Al.
11. Where's The Boss?-Fooled into thinking his boss is dead, Al threatens to quit his job unless he gets a little respect.
12. Nightmare On Al's Street-Marcy is living a nightmare when a too-sexy Al starts popping up in her dreams.
13. Johnny B. Gone- When Al's favorite hamburger joint closes, he must choose between family and food

However, DVD's like these are hardly worth the effort of releasing in my opinion. While they picked 5 funny episodes, they hardly are the funniest episodes ever.
I cannot help but feel as if this collection was meant as a pilot project; just to see whether people would actually buy Married with Children on DVD, rather than releasing the one of the seasons, and then finding out there would be no public interest.
Luckily, they realised their error by now, and released Season 1 and 2. I'd definitely recommend those over these 5 episodes.",1086480000,6,805,4.798561151079137

The only real bonus included with the Season 1 set is an interview with the cast - one too short. There is really no reason to buy this set other than for its face value - that it has the funniest, most original show of its time, with humor that is still relevant now.

Not sure why other reviewers found it so bad... May be it has to do with equipment they use. I have a SONY KV27FS100 TV and a SONY DVPNS575PS DVD player.
As far as the content of the DVDs goes, the funniest (in my opinion) episodes are yet to come in the subsequent seasons, but there are quite a few good laughs in these early episodes. The fans of the show will enjoy them for sure.

On April 5,1987,the Fox network was born and this megahit sitcom premiered. Not only that,the first 3 episodes of ""Married...With Children"" aired. The first three episodes of ""The Tracey Ullman Show"",which premiered the same night,followed each MWC episode one by one. Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal are Al and Peg Bundy with two children named Kelly and Bud(Christina Applegate and David Faustino). The Bundys are nothing like the Bunkers,the Bradys,the Huxtables or even the Conners. Al is a shoe salesman in a shopping mall and Peg is a housewife with on-and-off employment. Kelly is a fifteen-year-old attractive high-schooler who is dyslexic and incredibly dumb. Thirteen-year-old Bud still has not lost his boyish vocals. Kelly and Bud are often vocally at war with each other and Bud often teases Kelly. The Bundys' neighbors are newlyweds Steve and Marcy Rhoades(David Garrison and Amanda Bearse). They occasionally frown upon Al just like Peggy,Kelly and Bud. This ... family became so popular they delighted viewers for another 10 years. Garrison left MWC in 1990 and was replaced by Ted McGinley of ""Happy Days"" fame. When McGinley joined,Steve and Marcy were divorced and Marcy would later marry McGinley's character,Jefferson D'Arcy,who stuck with her through the series' demise.

also, when purchasing this dvd, i ignored the warnings of 'poor picture quality.' well, after watching the episodes, i can say that the picture quality is pretty atrocious. at the worst moments, the picture is fuzzy, and unclear.

Unlike some shows out there, this show is very funny, has great actors, and doesn't get tiresome to watch, no matter if you've seen the episodes before.  As for the DVD, it's pretty good for a first season.  The actors took awhile to figure out how they wanted to portray the characters (Al's accent in the first few episodes comes to mind), but once they did, the results were hilarious.  The DVD is lacking a bit in special features, but the sound and picture quality is good, considering how old the episodes are.  Can't wait for Season 2!",1073433600,2,604,4.555555555555555

1818160,5,B00007KK56,"The date was April 5, 1987. The day that TV and the way we see TV families was changed. At this point, we had 35 years or so of family comedies that showed us parents who had good jobs, always had a word of advice, upstanding kids, a nice car, a nice house, and had good neighbors in a nice neighborhood. Not that that is bad, 'cause I love some of those myself, but viewers were in need of a change. A show called ""Married With Children"" came along and showed us how the other half lived. The head of the household was dad Al, who was played by Ed'O'Neill. Al
was a schlumpy loser in life who has a dead end job working in a women's shoe store. Spent his time daydreaming of his glory back in his youth. Wife Peg(Katey Sagal)consisted of big red hair, spandex, bon bons, and an addiction to Oprah and the couch. The kids were Kelly(Christina Applegate), a blonde airhead who flunked lunch and gave out her special kind of love all over the town. Son Bud(David Faustino)was the closest to normal of the bunch. Smart, did well in school, but was sly and sneaky and a loser in love. The neighbors were Steve And Marcy(David Garrison and Amanda Bearse), uppity ups who both worked in banks. And thus, the show was set in motion. This collection has the 13 episodes from the show's first season, which was a mid season replacement kind of thing. The pilot is basically a set up of The Bundy's meeting the new neighbors(and by the way, Garrison left during the 4th season after getting a role in a stage play), and displaying the show's nasty brand of humor. There were a lot of great moments in season one, but it was the first season, and you can tell they were trying to find their feet and their way. ""Thinnergy"" sees Peg going on a diet and her trying to get the rest of the family to join in. ""But I Didn't Shoot The Deputy"", one of the best first season eps, sees The Bundy's and The Rhoades getting a gun and a dog after a series of break ins, which leads to an unfortunate accident. ""Whose Room Is It Anyway?"" is a forgetful episode about Al and Peg picking what room they want Steve and Marcy to add onto their house. ""Have You Driven A Ford Lately?"" has Al and Steve restoring a 1965 Mustang, and ignoring the wives in the process. Al and Peg celebrate their anniversary in ""Sixteen Years And What Do You Get"", and leave the kids with Steve and Marcy(uh oh) in the season one stand out ep, ""Married...Without Children"". A good one. ""The Poker Game"", ""Peggy Sue Got Work"", and ""Al Loses His Cherry"", all fine episodes, but nothing earth shattering. Another season one classic is ""Nightmare On Al's Street"", which finds Marcy having sexual fantasies about Al while Steve is out of town. ""Where's The Boss"" is a file and forget it episode about Al's never seen boss, and the season ends with the episode, ""Johnny Be Gone"", a one long scene episode dealing with Al and Peg trying to get to their favorite food joint before it closes forever, but the kids' problems keep getting in the way and stalling them. The show did a lot of things really well and they never got some of the credit they deserved. Ed 'O'Neill was a fine comedic actor, and he did some nice character work with Al over the years. However, you can easily tell from the start of this season that Al was a tad different. 'O'Neill spoke in the first episode or two like Al was some tough guy from the Bronx. Sagal was a teriffic comedic actress as well. Same goes for Applegate and Faustino. The Bundy's were a family that never held anything in. I think that was one of the founding reasons the world embraced them. They spoke and acted in ways that maybe we have thought of doing ourselves but never did. It was a great show to watch to get away from the world and watch characters who let it all out and didn't care. They may of been a little too extreme at times to be like any real family, but they addressed people all over the world who didn't have the perfect family and the greatest of upbringings. The show, throughout the years, always stayed on top of the times and made it seem like it could last forever. Anyways, season one is a wonderful beginner's guide to the world of The Bundy clan from Chicago. The special features are dysmal and kind of ruin what really is a great collection. You get the reunion special that they had a year or so ago and that's about it. This collection still gets the full five stars because I'm reviewing the show. Great show with good to great episodes and is truly wonderful. The full five stars there, but one and a half stars for the special features.",1071619200,4,4567,4.3489461358313815
1818161,4,B00007KK56,"Being a child of the 80's, it was hard to miss all the wonderful sitcoms on television. I still vividly remember watching ""Married...With Children"" every Sunday night, and I feverishly looked forward to each new episode. In the years since then, I have seen all the episodes many times in reruns, and I am now glad to own them (at least the first season) on DVD. It is one of the few shows I have never gotten tired of.
The first season is rarely the strongest in the series, but the first season of ""Married..."" has quite a few gems. The second episode, ""Thinnergy"", has Peggy putting the family on a crash diet, with Al obviously disapproving. The dinner scene always cracked me up, especially Al's sarcasm when he tosses out the salad. Another excellent episode was ""Where's The Boss"", where Al threatens to quit his job at the shoe store unless his boss meets him and commends him on his work. It has the first of the classic ""fat woman"" jokes (""Madame, when Shamu needs a mate...you'll be there!""). But my favorite episode is the season finale, ""Johnny B. Gone"", where the kid's problems prevent Al and Peggy from going to the closing of their favorite restaurant. Seeing Marcy in a towel and Al making fun of her (""Here's a mystery...what's holding that towel up?"") never dulls.
The first season contained 13 episodes, which you'll go through pretty quickly. My hope is that the second and third seasons find their way onto DVD soon.
The DVD package is light on the extras (most TV show DVD sets are), but there is one main attraction. The much-lauded ""Reunion"" special in 2003 is included here, which is a must have for fans. While is provides nothing of real substance, it is fun to see the cast out of their element, reminiscing about their experiences on the show. The only drawback to this is that very little is touched upon about the show's cultural impact in the 80's, which was not inconsiderable for the series. It is just a fun reunion of the cast, nothing more. Sadly, they did not include the E! True Hollywood Story that was done on the show. It would have been a prize addition to the set.
While better episodes were to come in later seasons, the first season is still very solid, and should satisfy fans of the series waiting for a proper release. And with the addition of the Reunion Special, it is a must have for fans of the series. Add this to your collection along with the two ""Most Outrageous Episodes"" DVDs that are already out.",1071360000,6,2458,4.55079006772009

In fact I wish there were more of them.  Some say that the last few seasons were weak. Not true. The show changed. It became different but it didnot get worst. So this is season 1.

1818168,4,B00007KK56,The first season of any show has it's ups and downs and MWC certainly did as well. Some of the episodes are hysterically funny. I particularly enjoy I shot the sherif where Al mistakenly shoots Steve and Marcy's guard dog. The characters changed and evolved over time and in the first series Al's avoidance of physical contact with Peggy is not quite as exaggerated as it would become in later seasons. This is a great start at having this show in a DVD collection and I look forward to other seasons becoming available.,1068940800,2,520,4.602150537634409
1818169,5,B00007KK56,"Finally, after a very long and restless wait, ""Married with Children: Season One"" is now available to own on DVD.  Considered one of the raunchiest and most vulgar shows in its time, these 13 glorious episodes are here for your viewing pleasure for the very first time on DVD.  These guys ain't the Cosbys, that's for sure.
The show revolves around a shoe-salesman, Al Bundy, and his lovely (lovely??) family.  His wife is always on his case about money and refuses to clean or cook the house.  The kids are always driving him up the wall with their constant bickering and getting into trouble.  The only sane one in the family appears to be sane is the dog (although he doesn't really do much).  Yep, it's ""Home, Sweet Hell"" for Al Bundy all day, every day.  You can just feel the love.
I forgot how funny the first season was.  I don't think a second went by where I wasn't laughing hysterically at the Bundy hijinx that was occurring in each episode.  Personally, I think Al Bundy has some of the funniest lines ever.  All 13 episodes are some of the funniest TV you'll ever see.  It's nice to finally see them earn a home in the DVD world.
Here are the 13 episodes that are included in this set:
""Pilot,"" ""Thinergy,"" ""Sixteen Years and What Do You Get,"" ""But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy,"" ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately,"" ""Whose Room is it Anyway,"" ""Al Loses his Cherry,"" ""Peggy Sue Got Work,"" ""Married Without Children,"" ""The Poker Game,"" ""Where's the Boss,"" ""Nightmare on Al's Street,"" and ""Johnny B. Gone.""
This 2-disk DVD set also includes extra features like bonus trailers and the ""Married with Children Reunion Special"" that aired on FOX awhile back.  The picture and sound quality is pretty good, considering how old the show is.
""Married with Children: Season One"" is a must-have for any Married with Children fans.  Hey, with Christmas coming up pretty soon, this would make a great gift.  The Bundys were a crazy family, but they were family nonetheless.

The DVD is littered with trailers for the new Norm McDonald show and some Cameron Diaz movie in the ""special features"" along with other shameless promotions.  The Reunion Special, which aired earlier this year on FOX, is cut in half and leaves out the more revealing parts like Sagal's terminated pregnancy and Bearse coming out of the closet.  Also the complete first season is somewhat misleading because there are only 13 episodes here (Seasons 2 & 3 had 22 each).
As for the episodes, it may seem like a different show to those of you used to the NO MA'AM episodes.  There's actually an understated tenderness between Al and Peg that makes them seem more human and less like parodies.  The writing was on point for this season and some of the best episodes include ""Al Loses His Cherry"" and ""Johnny Be Gone"".

It wasn't Ted's fault, it was the writing and the direction the show went.  The humor was blunt and lusty, but very funny. Later on in the series, it just became mean, and not nearly as funny.

1818181,5,B00007KK56,"""Married With Children"" was a show that defined limits on the structure of national television. It was television at its most bizarre and candor. Writing that never let you down or kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what else could appear in a world so distorted from the one we live in. The Bundy's weren't the Cosby's nor the Cleaver's and creator Ron Leavitt and Michael Moye wouldn't let us forget it. In a land where the idiot is king, Al Bundy (Ed O' Neill) perfected it. The Archie Bunker without brains, Bundy symbolized anybody's wish to live peacfully after death. Crude and unapologetic, ""Married With Children"" made an immediate stinch with the new Fox network in 1987. Lets's face it, ""The Simpsons"" owes alot of gratitude towards its ability to be as revolutionary as it was. It was the first of its kind and has influenced about 80% of television today.

Episodes like where Al and Steve played poker in a bank vault, when Al and Steve worked to restore a Mustang car, or the classic ""period"" episode where all 3 women on the show had their times of the month at the same time and made life for the men miserable on a camping trip.
I quit watching the show a couple of years after David Garrison left the show because the episodes had lost their dark humor.  Jefferson D'Arcy was too much of a pretty boy and a whiner.  The one really good episode featuring Jefferson was the one where the Bundys and the D'Arcys competed in a supermarket shopping spree.

1818192,3,B00007KK56,"If you are starving to get ""Married with children"" in your home viseo library, this and the next volume are your only chance to get at least some. And the episodes are pretty good. I've got this DVD and I like it.
That's to say that I agree with all the folks here, that the whole season would be much much better. That's the main reason, I give this DVD 3 stars only. And also, well, normally you expect more stuff on a DVD that just five episodes, right?",1049932800,2,456,4.134831460674158
1818193,4,B00007KK56,"Hey c'mon - sure they could have picked different episodes but for those of us suffering from Bundy withdrawal this is a great selection of very funny stuff. The Lost Episode is very good but the Bundys living in a supermarket during the heatwave gets my nod as one of the best episodes.
Would I prefer a boxed set of all the classic episodes..yes..but until it comes out this will have to do.",1047686400,,393,4.397260273972603
1818194,3,B00007KK56,"Well, what I think they are trying to do is copy the way South Park came out with there Volumes. Then later came out with the Season one DVD. But I think its gonna be a waste if they keep selling these volumes, then later come out with the Season one. So I recommend you wait till they come out with the Season one DVD.  But if you got some extra cash, this dvd is worth the price.",1046822400,2,381,3.8846153846153846
1818195,4,B00007KK56,"First I'd like to say that I certainly understand why all the low ratings for this DVD.  The stars don't go towards the show itself, but more towards the fact that this isn't a complete season and a lot of people were hoping for that.  I understand and I admit I'm disappointed as well.  However, I love the show and have absolutely no problem getting these DVDs for the meantime until they finally (and I know they will at some point) release the entire seasons.
Despite the obvious complaints, I was still able to enjoy this collection of Married with Children episodes.  This really brings back the old memories, being that I used to watch this all the time when I was little.  Now it's even more funnier being that I'm older and am now able to understand all of the jokes.  And hey, who couldn't love Al Bundy??  The man rocks!
The DVD includes 5 episodes, 1 of them being a lost one that was deemed ""too raunchy"" for TV.  The episodes are as follows:  A Dump of My Own, You Better Shop Around Parts 1 and 2, No Chicken No Check, and I'll see you in Court.  All of them are funny as hell, but my favorites have to be the two shopping episodes where the Bundy Family actually LIVE in the supermarket since it is a MUCH cheaper way of staying cool.  (In fact, I would've paid the price just for those 2 episodes alone!)  But they're all great, as far as I'm concerned.  And they're not in any order, so some of the shows are older while others aren't as old.
The DVD really doesn't have much to offer, other than the picture looking very good for being television shows.  There's a few bonus trailers, but even those aren't that spectacular.  And, I wished that they would've included a few more episodes.  5 just isn't enough.
All in all, the ""Married with Children Vol. 1"" DVD is a pretty nice package, although it would've been much better if more episodes were included.  Hopefully they will start releasing complete seasons soon.  That really is the way to go.  Again, I understand why the low ratings.  The only reason why I'm not giving it a low rating as well is because I enjoyed it and have no problem of buying the complete seasons when they finally decide to release them.  For now, these will have to do.  If you really want to wait for the seasons to come out, then do so.  I'm sure they will eventually release them.  If you can spare a few bucks and would like some quality entertainment despite the problems mentioned, then this is something worth thinking about it.",1046131200,25,2485,4.399122807017544
1818196,5,B00007KK56,"I want to write a review of what this DVD is, not what it isn't. I wholeheartedly agree that it is unacceptable for Columbia/TriStar to not release full seasons of this groundbreaking show. But I do not think it should influence a review of this particular DVD. I agree with what everyone is saying, but this still is nice to have until the morons at Columbia can get their act together.
These 5 episodes are all classics and highlight what made this show so funny and unique. Even the episode ""No Chicken, No Check"" from the weaker, later seasons, is a winner. The real gem here is the uncensored ""Lost episode"", which was never shown on TV until this past summer on FX. The other three episodes, especially the 2 part ""You Better Shop Around"" are very solid selections. Each episode is highly funny and gives avid and casual MWC viewers exactly what they want. People who are new to the show can get a good idea what it is all about, and this collection would be a great springboard to the series. The ""extras"", if you can call them that, are non-existent, so do not expect anything beyond the actual episodes.
""Married with Children"" is one of the funniest TV shows of all time and deserves to be released in a season-by-season format. Until that day comes, this DVD and the soon to be released volume 2 should hold you over.",1046044800,5,1328,4.491735537190083
1818197,2,B00007KK56,"I was so excited to hear that Married with Children had come out with a DVD.  I thought that this would include lots of episodes, but unfortunately it only had 5.  I thought that this DVD was overpriced for a mere 5 half-hour episodes of Married with Children.  However on the other hand, I wouldn't mind paying more for perhaps the entire season.
Overall, I thought this DVD was okay for those who want to see a glimpse of the Bundys, but for those that were wanting to see a whole season of the Bundys, this DVD was a large letdown.",1045612800,,534,4.267326732673268
1818198,5,B00007KK56,"I do agree with other viewer's. I don't know why they
didn't release all 9 season's of Married with children
seperately. I own the All in the family and Sanford and son
season 1 dvd's and why didn't Married with children get
the same treatment. Maybe they only wanted the funniest
episodes to be on each of the dvd's and not every episode.
I love all the episode's. It's cool to put just the funniest
one's on a dvd but it would be better to own every episode
and every season. The only dvd t.v. show that is better than
all the other's are the x-file's seasons. I wish they could
tell us why they didn't have all 9 seasons sold seperatley.",1045353600,5,640,4.254098360655738
1818199,1,B00007KK56,"I wasn't going to listen to the above advice columns and got this one. I should've listened. MWC is the #1 sit-com of all time. You get 5 episodes in this DVD (actually 4 because one is a 'to be continued' episode of the Bundy's living in a grocery store). Al's making of his bathroom one is a classic, but that's about it for this DVD. Please share the love with the MWC fanatics like me.
Much like M*A*S*H and most other sit-coms, I prefer the earlier ones. I'll buy the first 3 seasons, but after Trapper & Colonel Blake leave, I won't have much interest, just like when Steve leaves. Jefferson just never filled the part. The psychodad one's I'll have to find where to fine. Back to Steve, he's in two of the five episodes on this DVD. That's not going to do.
I could be wrong and the MWC people are making a poll on who'll purchase this DVD by giving out these. I bought #1, but, that's all I'll buy with the exception of an entire season.",1044835200,12,944,4.220994475138122
1818200,4,B00007KK56,"I am surprised that people who have never seen this DVD are reviewing it. This DVD came out on February 4th in U.S. and I bought it the same day. The first thing that surprised me was the quality of the episodes. They are all very funny and the storylines are good. However, I would not put them in the ""most outrageous episodes"" category. The only one which deserves that mention would be the lost episode ""see you in court"".
The only problem I have with this DVD is that it has no extra material, just a bunch of commercial's. Some history about the show and an interview with the cast would have been great.
In conclusion, I would recommend that you get this DVD only if you're a diehard MWC fan. Otherwise, you're better off renting it.",1044489600,,740,4.369565217391305
1818201,1,B00007KK56,"In My Opinion, Married With Children was the greatest tv show ever, I loved it... Nothin can replace that show for me....
I was thrilled about hearing of a dvd release, but what good is it? It should have been a Season set... Notice on the booklet of this dvd set that everyone of the shows they advertise has been given it's First Season Set, however Married With Children was the only one they gave the best of sets to...
I don't give about the other collections, I just wanted this one...  and this was just a huge slap in the face to the fans.
yes it's nice that we finally get the banned episode.... but big deal, this should have been a seasonal set.",1044403200,2,656,4.248
1818202,1,B00007KK56,"Just wanted to put my two cents in. If nothing else, they should have released the 1st season if they wanted to test demand. (""Test Demand?"" a show that ran for 11 years and is still in mass syndication everywhere needs to ""test demand""?) MWC is a landmark in TV sitcoms, even if the critics fail to recognize it as such.  This is one of the few times, when everything, writing, premise, characters, and actors fell into place.
WE NEED THE ENTIRE SEASON RUNS!

1818203,4,B00007KK56,"I do agree with just about all the reviews I've read, Married with Childen should be released by seasons, but just as vince did with WCW and the invasion angle, he signed the wrestlers in such a way to make him more money. Fox is doing the same, release a few good eps. at a time for a little extra money and when we least expect it, Season 1 will be released, for example, people, like us now for the dvds, have been asking for Goldberg, and Finally, at wrestlemania this year we'll see Goldberg v. Rock. So, join me in writing to fox in pushing for release of MWC by season NOW not later. By the way I gave it 4 stars just for the shows on this collection.",1044316800,,658,4.069230769230769
1818204,3,B00007KK56,"As said by everyone who is smart enough to know that this is the greatest sitcom of all time: THIS SHOW NEEDS SEASON BY SEASON SETS.
Now, while greedy executives and foul bureaucrats do push these lame ""best of"" collections in the hopes of squeezing more blue-collar blood out of our wallets, these ""best ofs"" also serve another purpose.
Yes, this is an attempt to get more bread out of us. It's the George Lucas trick (first release Star Wars, then Star Wars with extra footage, then Star Wars in widescreen with extra footage, then Star Wars with even more footage just made up, then Star Wars with everything plus a plush toy of George Lucas with money in his hands and going ""yippie-yippie"").
However, these ""best ofs"" also serve to test out the market for this title. If MWC ""best ofs"" sell well then the fat cats will release season boxes because they will see that it is profitable. Sure, we fans known it would sell, we recall that MWC was a huge sucsess, but these producers have short memories, they only understand the profitability of immediate trends. They have no respect for classics the way that we do.
So we have a catch 22 here. Buy it and you are giving in to marketing ploys. Don't buy it and you may be dooming the world's MWC collections to home-recorded television reruns only.
In all likelyhood this show, and every show that was ever sucsessfull, will eventually come out in season by season sets.
But for now this is what we get (and Most Outrageous Volume 2 is in the works as I write this).
As for the disc itself, it does feature very little, but the episodes themselves are well picked. They are some of the greatest, funniest MWC episodes ever. I will at least give the DVD that.
You'll just have to decided for yourself about this purchase.
Because I am a lunatic for this show I will likely buy it as soon as it becomes available. I hate to be a tool of corperate opression, but I cannot resist MWC memorabilia. The show means too much to me, I am at it's command.
Three stars because it's MWC (which always deserves ten stars) but it's just a stupid collection (one star) when the fans and the series deserve more respect.",1043539200,18,2156,4.474619289340102
1818205,1,B00007KK56,"I am puzzled why anyone bothers selling TV series episodes on DVD any more without releasing the entire season at once. It may be just as well, though, since at the glacial pace Fox is releasing MASH and the Simpsons (two seasons per year), it will be about 2008 before MASH is finished and at least 2011 for the Simpsons. Even if they start full-season releases of MWC now, at that rate it would be at least 2009 to get all of them! They should take a clue from Paramount, which is releasing seven seasons of Star Trek: TNG and Deep Space Nine in their entirety in a single year. There's no excuse for Fox to be so stingy with its series other than greed or stupidity.",1042934400,12,669,4.275590551181103

ON ONE DVD TO TOP IT!!!!!
i have to agree..why is it that they can release shows like ""buffy"" and ""freinds"" but they cant release MWC!!
it just proves that alot of these companys don't want to spend time on real classic tv shows..i mean sure theres seasons of the simpsons,M*A*S*H,hogans heros,etc..but theres more ""modern"" seasons then there are clasics..they won't even spend time on a wonder years dvd collection!
but they will for ""freinds""!
so people...please save your money! hope that we will see a season of MWC on dvd..NOT 5 MEEZLY EPISODES!
this is a piece of garbage..you (the fans) want a season...not this 5 episode piece of jargon!

Everyone knows what the fans want - a complete collection of all episodes, by season, on dvd, just like tons of other shows - most of which don't even compare to MWC.  So just give it to us!  Don't try to make a million bucks off a cheesy 'compilation', then turn around and make yet even more money on the seasonal release years later.  Just give us the DVD!  The technology is there, so just do it.  I'm getting this strange feeling of deja vu... *cough*georgelucas*cough*...
Ok I'm better.  Married has already made the networks so much money from ratings and sindication that they should be giving away the dvd's at this point.  Sorry for the heavy sarcasm, but the point remains the same.  The show is/was wonderful and ground-breaking, and its time the execs stop jacking around for more $$ and starting giving the fans a little respect.
I am giving 5 stars for the best sitcom ever to grace the airwaves, but I have to take away 4 stars due to the poor treatment of the MWC cast & crew, and the insulting treatment and exploitation of its loyal fans.  Its all about the money.",1040774400,14,1307,4.547008547008547

7977520,5,B00007KK56,"Married with Children was the first television program on a new network called Fox that aired in April 1987. The first season only had 13 episodes. In this first season DVD set, it includes the opening credits as they first aired in 1987. A series with basically unknown cast became one of the longest running comedy series ever with 11 seasons.

It began with the Bundys and their two children. Al and Peg Bundy are more like a lighthearted version of Edward Albee's George and Martha from ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? only with two children, teenage Kelly and her younger brother, Bud. If George and Martha had children like them, they might feel blessed to be childless. Their neighbors are newlyweds, Steve and Marcy Rhoades. They remind you of the young naive couple from the Albee's classic drama.

The two couples get together in the first episode much to Al's dismay. He would rather be at a basketball game. The thirteen episodes began a revolution about dysfunctional families. I can still watch the same episodes repeatedly and still do almost thirty years later. The cast reunion included Steve Rhoades (David Garrison) and Jefferson Darcy (Ted McGinley). The five cast members Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy), Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal), Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate), Bud Bundy (David Faustino) and Marcy Rhoades Darcy (Amanda Bearse) remained with the series for eleven seasons. David Garrison commuted from New York City to do the series and left on good terms with the cast and crew so much that he returned to reprise his role.
