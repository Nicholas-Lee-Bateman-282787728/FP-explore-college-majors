8225044,3,B000WPJT28,"This was a DVD set I really wanted so bought it suspecting it has not been restored/remastered and it certainly has not - while I am only up to the third of the 11 DVDs in this set I can say that it is ok to watch and at times I feel some of the footage looks fairly good but overall it suffers from having not been restored/remastered and I also found that the video can be a little jittery at times - it's not the worst I've seen in these old 50s/60s DVDs that have not been restored/remastered but hey Timeless Video, this one would really benefit from being digitally restored/remastered!",1360886400,6,592,4.294642857142857

8225046,4,B000WPJT28,"4 episodes on each disc gets you about half of the 104 half-hour episodes of this television western series; they were originally broadcast in local syndication during the 1951-55 television seasons. And it played for years after that on Saturday mornings.

The series fell into the ""Kiddie"" western category with shows like: ""The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"", ""The Lone Ranger"", ""Rin Tin Tin"", and ""Sgt. Preston of the Yukon"".

Blond, rugged, All-American action film hero (""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"") Bill Williams played the title character. Don Diamond played Kit's ethnic sidekick El Toro. Diamond is probably best remembered as Corporal Reyes on Disney's ""Zorro"" series although he would also go on to play ""Crazy Cat"" on ""F-Troop"".

The series was pretty straight forward with few surprises, occasionally villain would be presented with some shades of gray which made it more multi-dimensional than most similar series. Like ""The Cisco Kid"", the series served as an unlikely showcase for some of Hollywood's most attractive starlets. While none of these girls seem to have made it big, no other westerns of the period managed nearly this attractive a group of distaff guest stars.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1292976000,10,1239,5.144278606965174
