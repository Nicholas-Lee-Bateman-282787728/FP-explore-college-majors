1648161,5,B00005QCW3,"I highly recommend the Video Girl Ai series to any serious anime fan!  Ai is one of my favorite anime characters of all time.  Her interactions with the lead character Yota are very realistic and heartwarming.
Yota is attenage loser who encounters, Ai(which by the way means love in Japanese), who emerges from his TV screen when his VCR breaks down.  Ai helps Yota come to terms with his love for a classmate, and a love triangle ensues.
This video is among the very best when it comes to the romance sub-genre of anime!  The art is well-done and enjoyable; the story is intriguing and will tug at your heart.",971222400,,610,4.5181818181818185
1648162,4,B00005QCW3,"Video Girl Ai is a great manga and a great anime.  Though the manga provides a lot more character development; we still get treated to some nice interpersonal development in the 3 volume series.
The ending of the 3 volume series is a bit of a downer, but still a heartwarmer in a bittersweet way!  An excellent pick for an anime fan who loves the romance sub-genre.",971222400,,365,4.432835820895522
1648163,5,B00005QCW3,"This is an excellent series.  First Date is the 2nd in the Video Girl Ai trilogy.  It continues where the first left off, and shows that sometimes dreams are hard to let go of, and just how far friends will go (and how  much they'll sacrifice) for the people they love.
A very worthwhile title  to add to your video and anime collection.  Highly recommended.",959644800,,358,4.446153846153846
1648164,5,B00005QCW3,"This is the last of the Video Girl Ai trilogy, and, by far, one of the most touching I've ever seen.  It asks the quesition ""How far would you go to find the one you love.""  Ai has been taken, and Yuta must  travel to the Video World, a different dimention where not all is what it  seems, and where he must overcome the traps and snare set in his path to  rescue the Ai, the one he loves.
Make sure you watch to the very end of  the credits to find out what happens.
A great title to show the ability  of anime to express a very touching story.  An excellent addition to your  anime and movie collection.",959644800,,605,4.016806722689076
1648165,5,B00005QCW3,"First Date is a great romantic anime.  Picking up where the first set of episdoes ends, this continues to explore the idea of the love triangle, what people would do for the ones they love, and what happens when you  realize that something you really want you might never get.
It is an  excellent anime well worth putting in your collection.",959644800,2,341,4.557377049180328

body language it wasn't funny but that's what drives it. Lot's of body to body talk and who really ends up with who. The manga was great (somewhere on the internet, be careful this one gets scary) and acts just like the video in that respect. this is yet another title going way back in time but it's definitely a delivery you should expect. it's a trip back to adolecence when boys play with girls and funny enough no parents show up ??? :)",1160006400,2,587,4.149122807017544
1648169,5,B00005QCW3,"I liked this one a LOT. So loveable and sweet, and sometimes funny,sometimes depressing,yet this anime is so much fun to see. Not to mention lovely animation,sweet songs and a nice and surprising ending.",1147824000,3,203,5.0
1648170,5,B00005QCW3,"""Why do you look so sad?  I see, unrequited love.  Don't let it get you down.  She just doesn't understand.  You've got a lot to offer.  I know I'm not much, but I'll do my best to cheer you up.  I see, it's that bad.  You really need me, right from the heart.  That's it!  I'll stay with you for as long as it takes.""

So saying, video girl Ai Amano crawls out of Yota Moteuchi's TV set, becoming a virtual girl to a real living girl.  Moteuchi is thought of as a loser at high school, so he is called Motenashi (or unpopular).  The only two people he hangs out with are his friend Takashi Niimai, the way too cool guy who has the opposite problem of Yota, and the cute Moemi.  Yota has a crush on Moemi, but she has one on Takashi.  Yota kicks himself when he accidentally lets slip out Moemi's feelings about Takashi in front of the latter.  When Takashi says ""Sorry, you're not my type,"" it's a shot in the heart to both Moemi AND Yota.

Moemi is a pretty nice girl, and she braves the episode through, although still nursing a crush for Takashi.  But while Takashi won't do a thing to return her feelings, to the point of being cruelly insensitive, so too is Moemi clueless to how Yota feels about her.

The short-haired, tomboyish, and huskily voiced Ai herself is quite a character.  However, she has only one month of playback time, and that means Yota can't use his VCR, but at least he won't get bored.  Ai's mission is to get Yota and Moemi together.  ""She doesn't hate you, so you've still got a chance,"" she tells him.  She also lists his good points, such as his constant worrying about others and how despite her making him a yucky meal, he appreciates the effort she put into it and eats it anyway.

The trouble begins when Yota buys Ai a dress as a present for her cheering him on.  A touched Ai says that video girls aren't able to fall in love.  Yet a tear runs down her cheek as she thinks, ""But...what is this pain in my heart?""  Result:  she herself begins falling for Yota, which is conduct unbecoming a video girl.  After all, it goes against her purpose.

The scene of a fisherman catching a boot and saying that one never knows what one will catch is also thematic to finding that certain someone.  Yota originally wants to be with Moemi, but his time with Ai causes him to think otherwise.  And a scene of Yota trying to rescue Ai while climbing up a glass staircase that breaks under his feet, causing him to turn into a bloody mess, is an allegorical symbol of the pain of love:  ""What is the purpose of climbing that fragile, uncertain stair? ... The staircase itself may vanish.  Can your love is more than mere illusion?""  And Moemi later wonders ""Is love something you can be sure of?  It's not.  Everything changes with time.  You can look everywhere for endless love and never find it.""  In other words, love is fragile, painful, and most important, ephemeral.

The bonus vignettes between each episode are also funny, particularly a satirical take on Godzilla, via Lovedraconius Aizaurus, and a commentary on why anime is always in standard Tokyo Japanese, leading to a rehash of scenes from Episodes 1 and 2 spoken in the Hakata and Osakan dialect, which got a laugh out of me.  And there's a different screentone quality in the drawing, which matches the original manga-none of the standard large eyes prevalent in today's anime.

Based on Masakazu Katsura's 15-volume manga, Video Girl Ai is classic pre-digital anime-1992-and also one of Megumi Hayashibara's early roles as Ai.  It also benefits from the melancholy closing theme, ""Ano Hi Ni""-or ""On That Day,"" which sets the tone for what Yota and Moemi are going through.  For those who have or still have scars of unrequited love, or of the pure of heart, this 6-part series is for you.  A landmark in the history of anime and not to be missed.",1141603200,6,3837,4.458992805755396
1648171,4,B00005QCW3,"I loved it.  It summarized the plot in the 13 volume manga series very well, though it just skimmed over most of the major plots in the manga series.",1141257600,,149,4.137931034482759
1648172,5,B00005QCW3,"It really made me cry. I read the complete manga a couple of years ago and I agree that this DVD it's way too short to fit the complete story. The original manga has over 15 volumes and this DVD is set only on the first volume - shame =( -. Nevertheless, the story is really touching and the soundtrack has some of the best anime music so far (along with other works from Yoko kanno or Nobuo Uematsu). The plot I think has been already very well explained in the other reviews so I won't add anything further, just wanted to add the comment about the music.

1648174,5,B00005QCW3,"i had seen 'video girl ai' first on a local access channel - it had subtitles, which was the only thing i didn't like about it - but it kept my attention and towards the end it brought me to tears. after several years of trying to look for it on video i finally found it at a suncoast video store - AND THEY HAD IT DUBBED IN ENGLISH!!! - i was soooooooo happy (especially since i didn't have to be reading anything while i was watching it) - one week they had the first volume, then another the next, and the final one after that. i've looked on eBay to see if it was available on dvd, but the only dvd's i saw were only in japanese with subtitles - i'm just now seeing this on amazon now, but the description doesn't say anything about having an english language track - so if anyone owns this exact dvd - please tell me if it does also have the english track, and not just japanese, thanks!",1085616000,,892,4.073863636363637
1648175,5,B00005QCW3,"This DVD seemed to jump out at me while browsing the racks one day, compelling me to buy it, though I'd not even heard of it before...perhaps it was fate?
Because this is simply one of the best, most intensely romantic anime I've had the pleasure to watch, and yes, shed a couple of tears over.
Perhaps in part because I find myself identifying strongly with Yota ""Dateless"" Moteuchi, I too have fallen in love with Ai Amano, and in the three weeks since watching the DVD, I've acquired the 7 volumes of the original manga currently available in translation, and imported the soundtrack CD!
But I digress...others have covered the basics of the plot in their reviews, so I'll say that Katsura's designs and story are crisp, clean, and beautiful from start to finish, and have been translated to the screen with incredible faithfulness.
If you're a fan of the ""magical dream girl"" genre exemplified by ""Ah! My Goddess!"" and ""Chobits,"" you'll find this bittersweet tale to be just what the doctor ordered, perhaps even, as I've found, becoming your new favorite...",1082764800,4,1062,4.808743169398907

1648177,5,B00005QCW3,"Video Girl Ai is one of the shows that got me into anime to begin with. It's a charming story of the unrequited love of Moteuchi Youta, and the ""Video Girl"" who comes to life to aid him in winning his friend Moemi's heart. The gentle music of Noriko Sakai and the enthusiastic performance by Megumi Hayashibara as ""Ai"", her best character other than Lina Inverse, are some of the highlights of this production. Also noteworthy are the extra ""omake"" mini theaters that add a lot of personality to the show and it's characters. The English dub is quite well acted, though the Japanese track is not to be missed.
Although the ending is a little overblown, the hard lessons of adolecence that the charcters must learn are ultimately rewarded with a better understanding of thier feelings. This anime is the sort of production that is rarely seen anymore, truly one of the greatest OAV series. The whole 6 episode series on DVD is a must have. 5 stars.",1048636800,,947,4.609467455621302

Throughout you'll find yourself laughing at the antics of ""Ai"" (the girl from the video world), pulling for Yota (the ""Dateless"" male lead), and hoping that someone will end up finding happiness.  Through all the twists, your heart will be wrung of its emotion. Then when the final scene arrives and you look for release, you'll find none. The ending was NOT what had been expected.

1648179,4,B00005QCW3,"*
Can a ""cartoon"" be so sweet and so touching that it can actually make a grown man cry? It would seem that certain ones do indeed have that power. Two special cases of note are the Warner Bros. feature-length film, ""The Iron Giant"" ... and the 'nippon no anime' feature film, ""Urusei Yatsura: Final Chapter"" (not yet marketed in the United States) which never fails to have me shedding tears by the teacup-full whenever watching it through. Now add on to that list a third title: the Japanese OAV, ""Video Girl Ai""!
In typical Japanese anime fashion, ""Den'ei Syoujyo: Video Girl Ai"" establishes itself with the well-utilized ""love triangle"" concept -- but rather than following the same tired 'formula' to the letter, the storytellers break with the typical anime tradition and throw us some fresh, fast and unexpected curve balls.
The story bases itself around the painful double heartbreak of two of its main characters. School pals ""Youta"" and ""Moemi"" had decided to confide in each other as to the identity of their 'secret love.' Youta is terribly afraid to admit to Moemi that it is indeed she whom he holds this secret crush upon, and is further disappointed when she admits that her secret love is for the very popular ""Takashi,"" who just so happens to be Youta's best friend. But Moemi's heart is also shattered when, upon admitting her feelings for Takashi within earshot, Takashi responds negatively to her revelation.
Logic would state that Youta would follow this lead of Takashi's by pursuing Moemi more deliberately (especially in light of the fact that Takashi already knows that Youta has feelings for Moemi and, by his rejection of her, tries to give Youta that needed push in her direction). But Youta, being his own worst enemy in such instances, has two things working against him: He is terribly shy, and he is entirely selfless! Even in the aftermath of Takashi's rejection of Moemi, Youta's feelings for her are such that he even does what he can to try to bring Takashi and Moemi together for the sake of her happiness, though it kills him inside (Youta reasons that it is much less devastating that her feelings are for his friend Takashi than for any other person).
Heartbroken, nonetheless, Youta comes across a video store he had never noticed in the area before and decides to rent a video supposedly designed with lonely hearts in mind. He chooses one featuring a strangely costumed girl named ""Amano Ai."" When he plays her tape she literally comes through his television screen -- Her mission: To help those with issues of unrequited love overcome the issues holding them back (in Youta's case, his extreme shyness and uncertainty) and to offer assistance that might help bring the two together.
At least that's what would have happened under normal circumstances. In this instance, Youta plays the tape on a damaged VCR, which causes some serious complications for Ai when she attempts to cross over from her video world into our world.
The tape player condition which interferes with Ai's materialization also disrupts her hardwired programming in such a way that she progressively behaves less like a ""video girl"" and more & more like a real girl. For instance, rather than functioning as a conduit for bringing Youta and Moemi together as required, Ai instead becomes jealous of Moemi and actually makes efforts to keep the two of them apart, while her own feelings for Youta gradually begin to develop into her namesake...""ai"" (""love"") -- feelings and emotions unequivocally forbidden to be experienced or expressed by video girls.
Thus being judged ""defective,"" Ai is to be ""recalled"" by those who created her-- even well before her 'month-long rental' period has expired --which culminates into the emotionally charged tragic climax which unlocks the floodgates of every functioning tear duct.
Though the ending is a bit ambiguous and more-or-less left open to various interpretations, it raises any number of intriguing questions, such as, 'When is Love real?' and 'At what point do you pull yourself away and move on?'
As in most cases with anime, the dubbed ""English"" version changes the dialogue in several key areas of conversation where the meanings and motivations of the characters are completely altered and do not convey the original thoughts and feelings reflected in the original Japanese language version, but I would still recommend watching both versions just to experience two slightly different interpretations of the same story ... both emotionally powerful and effective.

1648180,5,B00005QCW3,"I can't believe how good this anime is. From the moment I saw the trailer inthePLEASE SAVE MY EARTH dvd, it instantly hooked me, and I was sure to have it, as soon as it was released (on dvd). It finally did, and I just bought it. It surpassed my expectatives.
  Besides the trailer I didn't know what to expect; I just new it was good, but way how good!!!! It's incredible fun and funny; it has a well amount of comedy, love and drama.
  Once you put the dvd on, you won't stop. It will instantly grab you from the very begining; so be sure to have 3 hours free.
  The story is as beautiful as well told. The animation is still very good and the music just pleases your ears.

  This dvd is TO BE SEEN BY EVERYONE!!! Everybody will like it, anime fans or not; animation lovers or not. Just know that this is not for kids, altough it doesn't include sex, or graphic nudity, it has some; the great thing about this is that the nudity here is justified, and not just for being there and isn't offensive.
  This one is really a jewel, and it's one you'll see more than once. Just be sure to watch it alone first, so you can grab as most as you can, and then watch it with your family and/or friends and look to their faces and hear what the have to say about it.",1013558400,4,1259,4.0772357723577235

The characters are cute and likeable, and the story is fun with enough depth to maintain interest, but not too serious.  It is lighthearted romance done very well.  The animation is very striking, and the character designs are what really set this series apart.
The series is on the same high-quality level as ""Oh My Goddess.""  This DVD is a really nice value, with the entire series on one disk.  Recommended.",1004486400,18,516,4.885057471264368
1648183,5,B00005QCW3,"This volume of the anime is based on parts of chapters 8-20 of the manga. Most of the plot comes from 8-11 and scattered bits from the very end of 15 through 20.
In the first volume, (for background purposes here) while watching her videotape, Ai comes out of the TV screen to help Yota with his love life.
In the first episode on this tape, Yota decides to enter an illustration contest for children's books to get my mind off of Moemi. Meanwhile, Moemi is trying to make a relationship work with Yota's best friend, Takashi. Ai discovers that she truly loves Yota and quickly learns the consequences of those emotions which she is not allowed to have.
In the final episode, Ai's creator has appeared and decides that Ai is defective. Her love for Yota violates her programming. Yota enters the surreal video world realm to rescue Ai.
The ending may not be enough for some people. It's not a clear cut ending like most anime I've seen. The moments during the ending credits provide hints at what might be in the future for the characters. What is shown has not appeared in the English version of the manga yet so I can't say whether it's loyal to the original or not.
When comparing this to the manga (comic), in some ways this feels rushed because so much was not used. It was severely condensed. However, it did seem great before reading the manga. It does work very well. Your own personal preferences will determine whether those missing plot elements will bug you or not.

Overall, I enjoyed this, but I'm not sure if I like some of the parts added in. When Ai finds a way to get some money so they can get home, that first guy taking his shirt off as if he's about to fight someone, when he's just doing Rock-Sissors-Paper, is a bit much. ...unless he's just getting worked up for a chance to kiss Ai.
Ai does seem to show her jealousy more directly here than in the manga. The fisherman story at the end fits well and might even describe Yota - ""too nice for his own good.""

Yota is in love with Moemi who loves Yota's best friend. His friend doesn't love Moemi in return, and Yota is actually more upset over Moemi's unrequited love than his own. On his way home, he finds a video store he had never seen before and rents an adult tape starring Ai Amano. (It's not an XXX tape.) While watching the tape, Ai offers to help Yota with his love life and comes out of the TV in order to attempt to follow through with her offer.
Yota's last name is very similar to the Japanese word for ""loser."" (In the manga, they chose to use ""dateless"" for the translation instead.)
I enjoy this series and bought all three tapes within a one week period. (I also saw the movie Loser in the theater the night I bought this volume so I was definitely in the right frame of mind that week.)
However, compared to the manga, I feel some elements of the story were a bit rushed or condensed. The characters are not as developed as in the manga. I would still recommend this tape though. I especially like the final little extra after the second episode showing a few scenes done with different accents and dialects - Southern, British, etc. Most of the episodes do have a ""Omake Theater"" following it. Here, both are humerous. Only the final episode of the series doesn't have one. (It's on the 3rd tape.)
Although I haven't heard about anyone not catching this, I feel I should advise people that the video distortion you see during the opening is normal. It's part of the story.

1648186,5,B00005QCW3,"Originally, it took me close to a year before I even considered picking this volume up.  I had mainly been interested in the werid and romantic plotpoints I had found in Rumiko Takahashi's series (Urusei Yatsura, Maison Ikkoku & Ranma 1/2), but upon coming to Chicago, IL, I took a chance and purchased the first volume.  AFter loving the story, I then purchased Vol 2 of the manga, before I bought all three video volumes in 2 days!  First, the basis of the story: Yota Moteuchi is the main character, a young man of 16 who is constantly referred to by his classmates as ""Dateless"" (which is what his last name can mean if misspelled a certain way in Japanese).  Yota has a major crush on a girl in his class named Moemi.  However, she has a crush on his friend Takashi, who is also a popular guy with all the ladies.  The problem is, Takashi has no particular interests in dating, and certainly not Moemi.  Hurting for both himself and Moemi, Yota walks into a strange video shop on his way home.  There, he rents a video featuring Ai Amano.  Episode 1: ""I'm Here For You,"" begins with Yota inserting the tape, and Ai giving her short introductory speech.  This scene palys out well, giving us the feeling that Ai is actually talking to us.  The video fazes in and out through static, and suddenly, we are immersed in Yota's room, as Ai comes out through his TV set.  Ai's first 2 minutes of screen time seem to indicate to us that she is a perfect angel, but due to a problem on Yota's VCR, she is somewhat ""distorted.""  Her figure has changed slightly, as well as her attitude and such.  However, she hasn't lost her touch, which is to try and cheer him up.  After a somewhat shaky start (including a not-so-pleasant dinner cooked by Ai), Ai agrees to help Yota win Moemi.  Episode 2:""Present""  This follows up the next day with Ai accomanying Yota to school to see about Moemi as well as who Takashi is.  There is a great item at the end featuring a segment where Ai tries hard to make a decent meal for Yota.  There are also tiny 3-5 minute segments after each episode that deal with Ai in a strange Godzilla creation, and one where the standard Japanese langauge is butchered to sound like all sorts of strange stereotypes.  The character design is very close to the manga storyline, with some minor changes made to make the characters easier to draw.  The girls are changed slightly, with Ai given a black shade in her hair instead of her more ""outsidish"" blond locks.  The mood and atmosphere the animators set up is very interesting, with several quiet mood changes that really make you feel for the characters, as well as draws you into the environment.

7950390,5,B00005QCW3,"I believe the anime gods blessed us from the heavens when they made this ova. Video Girl Ai is pretty much all of the things you would expect from a love triangle anime but its actually more than that. I am 21 years old but grew up reading the first 6 vols in my local libaray but couldn't find the rest i was saddened by this fact but moved on to some other great manga titles such as ranma 1/2,ceres,fusighi yugi,and etc. Video Girl Ai suddenly popped back up in my life three months ago thanks to a friend who said i should read this manga online and i asked what is it and sure enough video girl ai popped back up in my life i finished the series and then finished the series of I's as well both great classics with non-stop action and entincing drama through every page. my friend told me about both the ovas of Video Girl Ai and I's so i went and bought them and having regretted it since. The OVA made me happy and sad at the same time. I loved watching video girl ai on my tv screen but i would cry when the last episode would play because then i know there wasn't anymore episodes left grant it it was a ova. i would had loved to seen the series completed with more than six episodes but i am not complaning. i would recommend this to anyone who loves a good laugh, excitement, or to even help you when your depressed because it works for me. i also love the opening song to the ova i always get up and dance with my westie terrior max to the song and we both love it. i wouldn't miss out on this good buy.",1337817600,2,1515,4.0365448504983386
7950391,4,B00005QCW3,"I have read the manga a hundred times and found out about the show.  I decided to watch it considering its one of the most emotional stories I have read.  The show was very decent, but way to short and half of it was credits.  But they stayed true to the story and didn't get much further then the second book.  If you have never read the manga it is an amazing story so watch it first.

But if you want to get everything none diluted to fit in a time frame read the manga, you'll get hooked instantly and you'll never have another book touch you the way this one does.",1261008000,,569,4.044642857142857
7950392,5,B00005QCW3,"This anime has been most enjoyable and I marvel at its attention to detail and fluid motion, especially knowing it was produced in the early nineties before computers had a large role in animation techniques.

Secondly, the character buildup over the six episodes were well implemented for the title stars Ai and Yota, though more development of the secondary characters could have been touched upon in the anime. However, in six episodes this seems a worthy sacrifice to bring the audience closer to the title roles.

Thirdly, voice acting in both English and Japanese were top notch and not too goofy sounding, and in the more serious moments was very convincing. Ai's English counterpart was especially sweet sounding with that strange little way her words were drawn out, perhaps summoning her inner valley girl? All in all, very well done.

Lastly, I won't spoil it for anyone but the final scene is perhaps the best visual metaphor I have seen in an anime, ever, and its representation of the series' focus on love and its many meanings left me speechless the first time I watched it. This scene is also beautifully complimented by the song ""Frozen Flower,"" which can be found on the Video Girl Ai OST.

Definitely a must have for those interested in romantic anime and anime in general.",1244592000,,1293,4.83710407239819
7950393,5,B00005QCW3,"I was stunned by this series when I popped it into my DVD player. The characters, sound, everything about this release is fantastic. The plot is basically a love triangle with so many things thrown into it that it's no longer recognizable as one. Our hero Yota is always feeling for others and not himself. It is due to this that the video shop Gokuraku appears to him from which he picks out a regular looking adult video. When he plays it on his VCR at home, the girl on the tape, Ai Amano, comes out of the TV, except since the VCR was broken, her personality is a little glitchy.

Over the course of the OVA, it chronicles Yota's attempts to win Moemi, his love and trying to win her away from his best friend. It also chronicles how Yota and Ai steadily become closer, culminating in the love both have developed for each other. The music suits the moods in the episodes perfectly, from upbeat J-pop songs to melancholy music box tunes, everything fits. The animation is also a highlight, boasting detail and warmth and truly showing the character's emotions on their faces as they go about with their triumphs and defeats.

What really hooked me more than anything was the voice acting. The English dub is decent, but the Japanese track is sublime, with the actress for Ai delivering an absolutely sublime performance. I've tried to make it a point not to cry for anything animated or filmed, but Megumi Hayashibara's voice during Ai's scenes of emotional turmoil or true happiness made me shed tears on occasion.

I was really surprised at how good this OVA was, at first thinking it might be a harem comedy like Tenchi Muyo!, but I was clearly mistaken. Video Girl Ai is in a class all by itself, resting on a pedestal and blowing everything that tries to be like it away. I'd go as far to say this is the best anime money can buy. It's hard to find nowadays, but whenever it pops up, do yourself a favor and spend the money on it; it's something you won't regret.",1210723200,,1972,4.472222222222222
7950394,5,B00005QCW3,"I love this dvd! The story and video is exactly like the books. Plus they give you great intermediate ""plays"". the only thing wrong with this dvd is that it only covers half of the story, and the ending is a little confussing about AI.(If you watch the end credits and see them all together)",1196726400,,291,4.3090909090909095
7950395,5,B00005QCW3,This volume finishes the short story. The ending is a little strange but the idea of a video girl is strange to begin with. This is a show with feeling to it and some sadness yet very good. Highly recommend.,1193788800,,207,4.2
7950396,5,B00005QCW3,This if the first of three tapes a 180 min show which on VHS is so much cheaper than the DVD out there. You can save 75% off the DVD price going with the tapes if you can still find them. VHS is getting rare to find but worth converting to DVD. There is a little nudity in this but many cultures nudity isn't that big of a deal and the whole family hear liked it. But our youngest is 13+ so I told her some Japanese anime will have some of that. Other than that it was entertaining and that is what its all about. And its  a short story without so many twists you can't figure out what's going on.,1193788800,,597,3.8934426229508197
7950397,5,B00005QCW3,"I have read a lot of reviews on this video girl Ai, and I thought I would give it a watch but the DVD was 56 dollars on Amazon. So I looked to the three VHS tapes and converted them for my personal use and this is a real nice anime. The whole family loved watching it. The English dub is fine but the Japanese is nice to watch. You don't have much choice when ordering tapes but you concentrate more to read the captions. The ending was strange yet fit the show and all in all a great movie and for less than 4 dollars for each tape was great value and one I bought new. Great find.",1193788800,,582,3.899159663865546
