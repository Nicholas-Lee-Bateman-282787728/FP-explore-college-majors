7840074,4,6303139272,"Think about where yoga was 30 years ago. That is when this tape was made.  Suzanne Deason looks so young. She has two students along with her. She does a good job of teaching a yoga class.
  She gives a lot of instruction about doing the poses and there is some time where she demonstrates the poses before we (the students) join in the practice. This might be something of a waste of time for those who are familiar with yoga and want a steady workout but the pause between groupings of poses can be a time to refresh. Students hold the mountain pose while watching her demonstrate the next group of poses.
 Most yoga classes do not hold the mountain pose for very long. The best part is the end of the class. She talks quietly while in the savasana (relaxation pose). I have so many yoga videos where they say you should stay in savasana for 10 to 20 minutes but they only do it for 2 minutes on the video. I like that part.
The class itself is challenging as it consists of groups of poses (vinyasas). It includes a down dog, plank, side plank, lunge, triangle, incline plane, bridge, sun salutations and you get to rest in between sets with mountain or childs pose while she demenotrates the next sequence. Each sequence is repeated and lasts about 8 minutes. The tape is 50 minutes but the work out is about 40 minutes.
 It is a challenging work out for a true beginner but it is probably too slow for an experienced practitioner.  Nonetheless, I feel it when I'm done.
I do not have a local yoga class so I like using a lot of different videos including (but not limited to) Lilias Folan, Rodney Yee, Ravi and Anna Brett, and even the Raquel Welch yoga video. They all have something unique to share.
This one fits nicely into my collection.",1301529600,,1747,4.3765432098765435
7840075,5,6303139272,"I love it!  I've used a few other videos and attended several yoga classes (only to quit afer 1 or 2 sessions). Suzanne Deason is wonderful! I fall somewhere between beginner and intermediate. Some asanas are easy, others more challenging.  All I know is I feel great, calm and very relaxed after this video.  Also, it's not too long (about 40 minutes if you fast forward through the beginning demonstrations which you don't need to see after the first few times.  I actually look forward to my yoga practice!  Love it.  Wish I could find Level 3.",1038960000,,547,4.587628865979381
7840076,5,6303139272,"I have been interested in yoga for many years but have never established a consistent practice.  Classes can cost a lot of money, books are helpful but limited (i.e. you can't actually see the flow of the poses), so for me, videos have been my favorite way to learn, and this video is probably my favorite of the dozen or so I've seen.  I've only actually bought two--Yoga Journal's ""beginner"" tape, which was thorough but veeeeery looooong, and an old Raquel Welch tape, which was well done but probably a bit too advanced for most people--the rest I've gotten from the local public library system.
Anyway, this tape has become my favorite because the instructions are clear and precise, (but not so detailed that you feel you need to take notes), and because some of the more strenuous poses have *practical, doable* modifications for beginners.  Ms. Deason speaks calmly, explaining each pose and addressing some of the typical concerns about breathing, how much effort to expend, etc.  The poses move quickly enough that you're not just waiting around, but slowly enough so you don't feel rushed.  In almost every other tape I've tried--even the so-called ""beginner"" tape from Yoga Journal--I've ended up getting distracted by long sections of explanatory material, or I've gotten discouraged and stopped using the tape because even the ""modified"" poses proved too hard for me (e.g. the wide-stance standing forward bends).  It's one thing to say that beginners will eventually be able to do the poses, but it's quite another to actually show modifications that allow the beginner to actually *feel* successful where they are right now.  This video really succeeds at the latter goal, and I recommend it highly, especially to those who are just starting out.",1029715200,,1762,5.013698630136986
