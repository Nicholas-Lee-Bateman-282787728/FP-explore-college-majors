4587635,1,B00569I59I,I bought this one at Walmart thinking it would be well accepted by my grandsons.  The oldest one asked me to turn it off and the youngest one totally ignored it.  I am so disappointed and wish I had never bought it.,1350604800,,215,4.095238095238095
4587636,5,B00569I59I,"My daughter saw the preview for this and it always made her smile and sing whenever she saw it.  Then at bedtime she would sing ""one small voice"" . It was so cute I bought the DVD for her when we were on vacation so she could watch it in the morning while we were getting ready for the day.  Of course she watched it over & over but then I realized the songs were getting stuck in MY head. I enjoyed the songs so much. When I bought the kindle fire HD I thought this would be a perfect addition to it.  So now we have both the DVD and digital version.",1350604800,,551,3.8584070796460175
4587637,3,B00569I59I,Video was ok.  It's definitely for older kids with not much action from the star - Elmo.  Overall it was entertaining but didn't keep the attention of my 16 month old for more than a couple minutes.  I would be more inclined to buy traditional Sesame Street videos with more muppet action.,1346976000,,289,4.519230769230769
4587638,1,B00569I59I,"Bought this movie for my 1 year old, found it extemely loud & boring, left me with a headache...maybe he will enjoy it when he gets a bit older...should have stuck to the Baby Einstein and Baby Genius dvd's -they are fantastic.",1346803200,,227,4.428571428571429
4587639,1,B00569I59I,"We were extremely disappointed with this purchase.  Our 18-month old daughter LOVES The Best of Elmo 1 and 2.  These DVDS are full of songs she can dance and sing to.  This is mostly noise with little singing and very little Elmo.  We turned it off after 15 long minutes, and will be donating it to Goodwill.  Save your money and buy the Best of Elmo, especially 2!",1329350400,6,365,4.3088235294117645
4587640,5,B00569I59I,I bought this DVD for my 14 month old son who doesn't really care about watching tv but he loves listening to music. This DVD incorporates music along with learning opposites. My son doesn't watch the entire DVD but there are some segments that he stops to listen to including the Garth Brooks sing along. There are some great special guest appearances on this DVD as well which makes it entertaining for me as a parent.,1325894400,,420,4.5394736842105265
4587641,3,B00569I59I,"The dvd was advertised as including Jason Mraz, but unfortunately not so. Only found out after taking delivery of the dvd. One disappointed son.",1321315200,5,144,5.041666666666667
4587642,5,B00569I59I,THis is one of the greatest Sesame Street videos ever.  We loved this particular episode and watched it over and over.  This video takes the best parts and adds a lot of new things.  Great Buy!,1320105600,,193,4.305555555555555
4587643,5,B00569I59I,"This is one of the best Sesame Street videos.  We got it the day it came out and have watched it twice already.  It includes 13 songs including a never before song by Cookie Monster.
It also includes Will I Am's ""What I am"" song, which is amazing by itself.

It's a must buy!",1315267200,,275,4.055555555555555
4587644,5,B00569I59I,"One thing that makes most Sesame Street productions - including the PBS version, now over 40 years old - is that it reaches viewers on two levels: The kids learn things (numbers, letters, counting) and the parents are treated to some great puns, satires and well-crated songs (thank you Joe Raposo!).

This 45-minute DVD is a delight and will keep adults entertained even on repeated viewings with their kids. (This from someone who has no kids.).

It revolves around Elmo findings a ""magic wand"" that when waved turns things in to music. If he waves it one way people sing instead of speaking and if he waves a different way voices get higher or lower, or faster or slower. There is little dialogue here but at least 14 clever songs are performed by both Muppet characters or ""celebrity guests"" from all genres. John Legend does ""Sing a Song"", Garth Brooks does a ""silly"" song and Sugarland and jazz singer Diana Krall get numbers too. Cookie Monster sings ""Come Back Cookie"". Bert and Ernie do a high/low song Broadway-style and there's a very clever song about a shirt stain to the tune of the Isley Brothers' ""Shout"".  Even original Sesame ""human"" Bob McGrath is here to sing. The finale is Elmo's solo ""One Small Voice"".

The bonuses are worth mentioning too: The HIGHLY entertaining 2-minute video ""What I Am"" by hip-hop artist will.i.am and a ""sing along"" option which provides the lyrics (bouncing-ball style"") for the complete show.

I have but one gripe. The DVD is indexed into only five chapters so you can't jump to a favorite song (remember there are 14 of them) when you want.

If you love Sesame Street, you'll love this and so will your kids. Heck, even if you don't have kids, you'll love it.

4587645,3,B00569I59I,It's okay. The transition could have been edited better. My daughter like singing with the stars better.,1405382400,,104,5.176470588235294
4587646,5,B00569I59I,"I think this video is better than the Singing with the Stars DVD.
It has story and both my baby and I love the music more.
Some reviews here disappointed when comparing with the Singing with the Stars DVD, I like this DVD better because some of sing in the other DVD are kinda outdated. This one is more recent. Highly recommended.
It also teaches about some concepts through the songs such as fast and slow, loud and soft, high and low.
All in all the program is very well designed and directed.",1402617600,,496,4.344086021505376
4587647,4,B00569I59I,"My son liked it but I wish this one have the latest songs, instead repeats some of the first Elmo's singing with the stars.",1387411200,,123,4.166666666666667
4587648,3,B00569I59I,"My kid watched episode 4202 and her first favorite song was Jason Mraz's ""Outdoors.""  Its advertised to be on this, but it is not.

Still a great product, but mislabeled and disappointing.",1382659200,2,188,4.84375
4587649,4,B00569I59I,My daughter loves Elmo and music so you can't go wrong with this dvd. It is a little shorter than I thought it would be. I was hoping it would be at least two hours long and it wasn't. That is my only complaint.  Overall great dvd.,1375142400,,231,3.9148936170212765
4587650,5,B00569I59I,I reccommend this dvd for any kids who are about to go on a long road trip.  It is very edcational.,1369008000,,99,3.7142857142857144
4587651,5,B00569I59I,"My daughter cannot get enough of this movie - she sings along and dances with Elmo and his friends.

4587653,5,B00569I59I,One of Elmo's great hits - great artists and my 2 yr old loves it. I recommend it highly especially for music lovers...,1361750400,,119,4.217391304347826

8459289,4,B00569I59I,"I love this. And they took a bunch of old clips and made them new again.
My 2 year old is all about Elmo. This is my favorite to play.",1420848000,,134,3.5
8459290,5,B00569I59I,Our 3 year old granddaughter has loved this Sesame Street episode since she was 1 and a half. It is by far her favorite and it is ours and her parents as well. We love the emphasis on music and the songs are fun. I know our daughter (her mom) watches it more than once in a day often because she loves it so much. HA HA HA,1416873600,,322,3.75
8459291,3,B00569I59I,"NOT the same as the aired episode of the same name. I have an autistic child and she was obsessed with the aired episode of music magic from season 42. *On Netflix we watched it every day until they removed it* I was very excited to be able to buy the episode here on Amazon, but alas this is not it. It is PARTS of it, so if you have a neuro-typical child they will probably enjoy it, but if you have a child who notices when they change a show, be forewarned that they changed the arrangement of the Music Magic section to break it up all over the video, and some of the words and things Elmo sings and says. They offer season 42 on amazon but you cannot get this episode in its original air style here, yet, as of this review. Frustrating.",1413331200,4,742,4.089041095890411
8459292,5,B00569I59I,"This is our daughter's favorite Elmo video ever. We love it, too! The music is great, and we find ourselves singing the songs all the time. When the first DVD got played to death (literally), I knew we'd have to buy a replacement. So glad to find it Amazon for such a great price!",1412380800,,280,4.203703703703703
