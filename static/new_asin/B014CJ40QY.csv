8730235,3,B014CJ40QY,"Like the other reviewer posted the title is not exactly correct as only 5 out of 15 movies in this set are about werewolves.
 all the others are about similar monsters including yeti and...bears but the dude who gave the title to this set must have been transformed to a werewolf in a full moon that's why he gave that title to this set....LOL
 NEVER THE LESS ... The set is worth the money as u get 5 werewolf movies and 10 others most of those containing similar monsters for just a dollar per movie so that's a bargain if u are in to this B-MOVIE MONSTER STUFF.
 the set has 3 discs each containing....5 MOVIES but that's what u get at this price.
 what u pay......is what u get.
 your choice.",1485907200,3,696,4.242424242424242
8730236,2,B014CJ40QY,"I was impressed with look, but as another review states, it's a misfire. What hit me is I asked a number of sites on line and no one I MEAN NO ONE could give me the movie list. I found a copy and was DISAPPOINTED !!!!!. Better off putting your own collection together! I have done that since 1984. Where is WEREWOLF THE TV SERIES 1987-88? Try to release that again and I will buy a real werewolf collection gem !",1485820800,4,412,4.098765432098766
8730237,1,B014CJ40QY,"First of all if your going to call something the werewolf collection you have to at least make the majority of the movies in the set be werewolf related. 10 of the movies in this set have nothing to do with werewolves. You can't call something a Werewolf just because it has fur and teeth. Secondly when I buy a collection of movies I don't expect them all to be good but I do expect a few gems in the bunch. Even if it's just one. Other then 2 or 3 movies in this set that look slightly interesting it appears to be a collection of duds. Here's a list of the films in this set sinse they don't say above what they are.

The Dark (1993) Not a Werewolf movie
The killer shrews (1959) Not a Werewolf movie
Werewolf in a girls dormitory (1961)
Grizzly rage ( 2007) Yea cause bears and werewolves are totally the same thing.

Night of the blood beast (1958) Not a Werewolf movie
Lurking fear (1994) Not a Werewolf movie
