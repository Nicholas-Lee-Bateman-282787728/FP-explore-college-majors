Go For Broke:  The film begins in 1943 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, with newly commissioned Lieutenant Michael Grayson (Johnson) reporting for duty with the 442nd, then in training. He discovers that he has been sent to a unit composed of Nisei, when he had expected to return to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard unit with which he had served as an enlisted man. Having joined the war to fight against the Japanese, he is disturbed to find he is expected to fight alongside people whom he sees as Japanese, rather than Americans. From the outset, Grayson runs his platoon with rather harsh treatment of his subordinates, including an almost martinet-like insistence upon the strict observance of regulations.

He (and the audience) learn that ""Go for broke"" is a pidgin phrase (used in Hawaii) meaning to gamble everything, to ""shoot the works""  to risk ""going broke"" or bankruptcy. Eventually, Grayson also learns the meaning of the frequently repeated expletive Baka tare, which, loosely translated, means ""very stupid.""

The movie is a great watch and will not disappoint!

And Three Came Home:  American-born Agnes Keith (Colbert) and her British husband (Patric Knowles) live a good colonial life in North Borneo with their young son in 1942. After the Japanese invasion, they are interned and then taken to separate prison camps, one for men, the other for women and children. Amid the brutality of the internment camp, the camp commander Lieutenant-Colonel Suga (Sessue Hayakawa) is respectful to Mrs Keith because he is familiar with her work, and is shown to be kind to the children even when his own family has died in Hiroshima.

The rest of the movie is just as interesting and fascinating. You must watch to see how this great film ends. A really, great classic!",1385424000,2,1939,4.981424148606811
