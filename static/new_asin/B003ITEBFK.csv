I know my husband and grown children/family/friends will watch ""Chow Down"" because it is so well made--Informative AND Entertaining! Who could not be caught up in the lives of these three excellent individuals, their health concerns, and their families? The requisite inserts of doctors' comments are appropriate, clear, insightful, and delivered with wonderful humanity. The animated segments point up statistics and clarify relationships beautifully. This is quite a film!",1337126400,2,598,5.440860215053763
4128278,4,B003ITEBFK,"I love this dvd.  It touches the very heart of disease in families.  Heart disease and diabetes in particular, are the focus here.  The information in riveting and I am inspired to move forward with a healthy new lifestyle of plant-based nutrition.  The thing that bugs me so much about this presentation is Garnet.  SHE is the one with diabetes, but spends the entire time blaming her family for not supporting her enough!  I don't get it.  She knows where this will lead, as she mentions that she held her dying uncle in her arms as he died from diabetes.  Yet she is not moved enough to take full responsibility for her own situation.  I have to fast-forward through her parts because it is just so much whining!  Other than that...I watch it over and over to be inspired!!",1336176000,3,776,4.517985611510792

4128283,5,B003ITEBFK,"Americans and other people in industrialized countries are dying from different diseases than people in the developing world.  We suffer from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune diseases - ""diseases of affluence"" that are almost unheard of in developing countries.  This long overdue film explains a little of the work of Caldwell Esselstyn and Colin Campbell(as well as that of Dean Ornish, who is not in the film).  Our dependence on meat, dairy, high-fat and high-sugar foods is behind our degenerative diseases, but the health agencies we count on to advise us, such as the the USDA, the American Cancer Society, and the American Heart Association, have bowed to pressure from agribusiness and have not been willing to incorporate this information in the dietary recommendations they make to the public.  The film explains that it's really not that difficult for people to prevent or even reverse these diseases - they just need to switch to a low-fat, plant-based diet. Even the medical community does not bring this up with their patients.  Last year my husband suffered a condition called obstructive uropathy after having BPH (non-cancerous swelling of the prostate) for a decade.  For the entire decade he took medication for BPH, neither the internist nor the urologist who treated him ever mentioned that this disease is almost unheard of in countries where meat and dairy are not consumed in large quantities.  We found this out on the internet.  After a $30,000 surgery, we have changed our diet and likely would have done so years ago if we'd had this information.  Now with more books coming out and films like this one beginning to educate people, the information is slowly leaking out to the public.  People are going to become angry that they've been misled for years, and I believe the future of medicine will be different -- especially when health insurance companies decide to balk at paying for the care of preventable diseases.",1293926400,42,1970,5.052469135802469
4128284,5,B003ITEBFK,"I've been reading a lot about food this year: Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food and Food Rules, Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, and Mark Bittman's Food Matters, among others. They all seem to be telling us the same thing: Eat real food, not too much, grown locally, mainly plant-based. Now here comes a film that not only re-emphasizes that this style of eating is good for us, it shows us that it can actually reverse the heart damage caused by all those years of scarfing triple cheeseburgers and mainlining mayo.

Chow Down follows three people: Charles, the lovable family man, John, the wry, witty professor and Garnet, the professional woman whose family loves pizza. Each one has decided to try an extremely low-fat, vegetarian diet (developed at the Cleveland Clinic) to reverse their heart disease; the film provides plenty of data to back up the claims. (And yes, there are the usual ""talking heads,"" of course--it would not be a documentary without them, right?) The upbeat, lighthearted animation keeps the style informative, never preachy, and I really found myself rooting for the three as they ""eat as if their lives depended on it.""",1280361600,38,1167,5.015463917525773
4128285,5,B003ITEBFK,"Chow Down was, for me, a great capitulation to Forks Over Knives, Engine 2 Kitchen, and Eat To Live.  The stories in it really hit home to me, as my family (extended and immediate) has suffered almost every imaginable disease, from Alzheimer's, Heart Disease, Stroke (near fatal), Leukemia, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, Prostate Cancer, osteoperosis, psoriasis...you name it.  Though it didn't necessarily include all the details that were related in the other media I previously mentioned, it came down to the practical, which really brought it full circle.  We're talking about peoples' lives, after all.  The personal stories were very real and near to me.  After trying Body for Life, Slim Fast, EAS supplements, and the Paleo Diet, I sense I've found a lifestyle that is more livable and manageable than I ever thought I would find.",1420848000,2,831,5.125925925925926
4128286,4,B003ITEBFK,"I've come across three movies of this type that I think were better made.

4128294,4,B003ITEBFK,"I really liked this DVD and found it honest and truthful..particularly the part where the guy admits that its hard to eat this way sometimes..because in the initial transition it is hard even for a junk food vegan who is switching to plant based vegan BUT i wish they had talked more about exactly what meals they made; eg, the wife talks about ""12 peppers for lunch""..really...what did you make that took 12 peppers? Anyway...it is great and I was so excited about it that I showed it to a friend whom I did not realize was NOT ready to change her diet (even tho diabetic) and she would not watch it through the end...which surprised me because I thought the information was presented well and all three people were regular people trying to make a change and doing the best they could and had great success!!  I really liked the fact that their children actually enjoyed eating plant based.  See this DVD and you will come away informed and hopefully changed.",1376006400,,960,4.575581395348837

4128298,2,B003ITEBFK,"I've read ""The China Study"", seen ""Forks Over Knives,"" ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,"" and ""Super Size Me.""  I've read a couple of Joel Fuhrman's books and have fasted.  Due primarily to ""The China Study"" and ""Forks Over Knives,"" I have changed my own cooking to vegan, and have gone vegan for a full week at a time here and there.  I like the food by and large, but it's difficult because I eat out a lot; due to my singleness it's just so convenient.  And when I cook, I end up with a huge batch and have to eat the same thing for a while.

One thing I applaud this movie ""Chow Down"" for is that it doesn't pull any punches when it shows the difficulties of going vegan.  It's not easy to do in our culture.  But at the same time, I'm surprised at how black a picture they paint.  There's a lot of great vegan food, but you have to be creative and it helps to be adventurous with cuisine from other cultures.  You can get great vegan food at many ethnic restaurants.  And by that I mean Indian, Thai, Chinese....The Olive Garden is not ethnic. :)

But overall this movie is not well done.  There isn't much of a point to it, it is just a lot of rambling.  It doesn't make any kind of cohesive arguments.  The animations and the music are just hokey.  And the message seems too pessimistic about veganism and curing disease by changing your diet.  With the whining of the folks in the movie about how difficult it is, they virtually discourage you from trying it.  The only ones who were successful were the ones who got dire medical news.  Their prognosis was their motivation.  None of their friends or family members were able to sustain the diet change.  In other movies and books, they give good examples of people who -- like Campbell and Esselstyn, changed their diets pre-emptively to prevent disease.  There are plenty of people in the vegan culture who would have been great examples to motivate people to change.

There are many books and movies in this new vegan genre that are informative and well put together.  This movie isn't one of them, however.

Still, for the $3 price of a limited-time rental, I got myself a reminder that I need to eat more vegan.  To pick myself up and try again.  I know it's possible.  Most of the world eats vegan.",1362268800,21,2257,4.375903614457831
4128299,4,B003ITEBFK,"While it was worth watching, I've seen better, and that's why I didn't give it a full five stars. I think it could have been fleshed out a little more in terms of maybe how the viewer could proceed, etc.",1360281600,,203,4.1

4128302,5,B003ITEBFK,"Great movie, I really enjoyed it.  I like movies on health and nutrition that present research backed information.  A lot of nutritional information (most of it) is not backed by research and is frequently incorrect.  This movie seems to mostly reference research backed information which I appreciate.  Chow Down is also very entertaining to watch, a bonus.  The benefits of certain diets are almost unbelievable.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a healthy lifestyle, has an open mind regarding diet or has health problems and is willing to try a healthy diet.",1349654400,2,582,5.073684210526316
4128303,3,B003ITEBFK,"I've lost weight by deleting unhealthy carbs and unhealthy fats.  I am doing good.  There ARE healthy fats.  Dropping the fast food and the processed foods are important, and focusing on veggies is essential.  Saying that meat is unhealthy is not actually accurate -- but yes, certain types and sources of meat are indeed unhealthy.  The real nuances of total health are not present in this video.  But that they want us to go for real foods, and much less processed -- I'm on board for that.

Still, I am concerned that HDL and LDL dietary differences and how they relate to what cholesterol levels mean -- this was TOTALLY ignored in this video.  A shame.  A rip roaring shame.",1341532800,4,679,4.591666666666667
4128304,2,B003ITEBFK,"The film has some interesting information that probably isn't too controversial, and also probably isn't widely known by the public, so I was glad that those pieces of information were included (the history of the development of the USDA food pyramid, the conflict of interest of the USDA, many medical procedures and drugs are band-aids instead of addressing the root cause of an illness, etc).  I wish there was a lot more of that type of content in the film, but I'm assuming that they only inserted a few of these snippets to try to bolster the film's overall credibility.

However, it is very clear to me that the film was made with a vegetarian/vegan agenda from the beginning, instead of having an open mind when they began the project.  I believe that their goal at the outset of the film was to try to prove that becoming a vegetarian or vegan can improve your health, especially if you are starting from a point of very poor health.  I am not a nutrition expert, but I am an engineer/scientist, and I believe that I have common sense.  There is a complete lack of scientific method to virtually all of the claims made in the film.  Did the participants improve their health by changing their diets?  Sure.  Could they have done so by changing to any number of other non-vegetarian/vegan diets?  Of course.  Could there have been other reasons that they didn't actually have a heart attack in the few years following their heart disease diagnoses?  Absolutely.  Are there many other people in the world living with heart disease that don't have an immediate heart attack?  Sure.  But the film tries to get you to believe that the only way they could have become more healthy and avoid surgery was to eliminate animal products from their diets, and it doesn't even attempt to examine any scientific alternatives or use any controls in their case studies or in the other ""experiments"" cited in the film.  One of the dead giveaways for me was that the director of the CSPI was included in the film at several points to try to reinforce their message.  Watch the film ""Fat Head"" to learn about the lack of credibility and objectivity of the CSPI, and their vegetarian agenda.  The film also seems to stick with the lipid hypothesis (which states that eating saturated fat increases cholesterol and causes heart disease), which is crumbling very quickly as far as I can tell based on many studies over the past several decades.  I laughed out loud when the film claimed that the government guidelines on a cholesterol level of 200 is still too high, since in the Framingham Heart Study, participants with cholesterol levels of 150-200 still developed heart disease.  The main doctor in the film pats himself on the back for recommending a cholesterol level below 150 to his patients, without any scientific proof that this is the right number or that this particular measure of cholesterol even matters at all!  Just another example of the lack of science in the film, which made it very difficult for me to believe any of its assertions.

I have absolutely no argument that diet can significantly affect your health, along with some contributions from your genetics (exactly what this film states too).  However, I believe that the film delivered very flimsy arguments that vegetarianism or veganism is the answer.  Two of the three case studies in the film complained constantly about their new diet, and if you read other nutrition books, they will tell you that's the primary reason people can't sustain those types of diets.  You are inevitably going to return to some of your bad nutrition habits once you can't stand the new diet anymore.  The film didn't address this at all.  I believe they should have recommended that you need to find a diet that is both satisfying and healthy.  They seem to imply that is not an option, and you have to suffer through a vegetarian/vegan diet to improve your health, which I personally think is completely wrong.  How many people do you think you are going to convert to your diet if it is so undesirable to many people?  The film uses an example of a guy who had a quintuple bypass as the alternative to vegetarianism.  Can you instead find examples of many millions of people his age who eat both satisfying and nutritious non-vegetarian foods who haven't had a quintuple bypass?  Of course.  Look at the high rate of heart disease in countries like India to get an idea that simply becoming a vegetarian is not the answer to heart disease.  The film alludes to certain countries and cultures that historically have much lower incidents of chronic diseases to the US, and that people who immigrate to the US from those countries adopt the disease rates of the US, but they completely gloss over any of the details, since those important details (most of those cultures primarily eat meat/poultry/fish) would not support their vegetarian agenda!  Yes diet is clearly a major health factor, but the film doesn't use any scientific method to prove that becoming a vegetarian is the answer.

The film takes a very slanted view at nutrition and health, and if you do decide to watch it, I caution you to do so with a very skeptical eye, and to consult with other nutrition sources before you believe much of anything that the film is trying to push.  Other recent eye-opening diet/nutrition books that I have read and recommend are: ""Wheat Belly"", ""Why We Get Fat"", ""Omnivore's Dilemma"", and ""In Defense of Food"".  I also recommend the film ""Fat Head"" to get a more balanced view on diet and nutrition (although I agree there are some controversial assertions in that film too, but I think it is much more balanced than this one, and it will debunk several other nutrition myths that we have been fed).

Note: I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 star, since I did find some if the information interesting.  I don't agree with people who immediately review a product as 1-star if they find any fault with it whatsoever.  I believe the filmmakers probably had good intentions to try to improve people's health.  I just happen to disagree with the methods used to try to make their arguments.",1340064000,16,6137,4.724882629107981
