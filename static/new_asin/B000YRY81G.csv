So I'm a bit biased in my reasons for buying the film. The building was used for years as a fundraising haunted house for the March of Dimes in Salt Lake City. Those were great times, and gave a lot of kids something productive to do and kept most of us out of trouble. A fun film for anyone in an MST-3000 kind of way!......Kevin",1510444800,,497,3.97
8233988,3,B000YRY81G,"This movie is mostly just okay because one of the voice-over actors is someone I know. It's fun to hear them act. The movie itself is worthy of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment. Near the end is where you get the best acting from the actress who portrays an alien. The rest is like... well, it makes the kids in the first Harry Potter movie feel like Tom Hanks caliber actors.

The transfer quality to DVD is pretty bad. You'll feel like you're watching an 8mm film from a basement, there's even a part where you can see the film readjusted.

Everyone in this film seemed to give a genuinely good effort. I don't know what else to say. Put on your Tom Servo and Crow goggles and you'll enjoy yourself.",1490054400,,708,4.356060606060606

8233990,5,B000YRY81G,"I was in this movie, I played as Ray. The movie was made on an extremely low budget. I have a family background in the TV and movie industry. The cameraman/director was a cameraman for a local news station. The technical personnel were college film majors. There were a few experienced actors in the group but most were high school drama students.",1460592000,,347,4.612903225806452
8233991,4,B000YRY81G,"Yes, this movie is lame. There were only a few members of the cast with any real acting experience. The rest were extras with lines, which were mostly forgettable.

However, I have family members who were involved in filming it and I would like to be able to torture them with it...",1368662400,,282,4.423076923076923
