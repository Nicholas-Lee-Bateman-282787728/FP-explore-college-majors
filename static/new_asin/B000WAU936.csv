8221989,4,B000WAU936,"It's always great seeing early footage of Muhammad Ali.  The only negative here is that these are not complete fights as I was expecting.  The first fight with Archie Moore was complete (4 rounds) but the other three were select rounds only. Also, no bonus features or post fight interviews.",1466121600,,291,4.8

8221991,4,B000WAU936,I was really shocked that i found this dvd. i got it in a Three pack with Ali Rap and Espn 2009 highlights. Didn't even know this dvd existed. I really Enjoyed watching all the fights on this Dvd. Archie Moore was incredible to do as good as he did agaisnt Ali at the age of 48 or 51. Archie's Mother said he is three years older than his stated age and she should have known best. I also love having a Floyd Patterson fight. This man was a class act and i always loved his peekaboo style of fighting. I had never seen the Brian London or Karl Mildenburger fights. This is a great find for any hardcore boxing fan. The Patterson fight is not complete but part of the fight is better than none.,1343001600,,693,4.102941176470588
8221992,5,B000WAU936,"This DVD does not even have a bar code...it was obviously a ""bonus"" disc if you bought ALI RAP at some chains. The Ali V Moore fight alone is worth the cheap price this is being sold at...it was an interesting fight and the black and white footage is film quality ..not video or worse..really nice. Sure I'd love to have the whole Patterson fight but they have picked several exciting rounds and the film again is good. The last two fights feature lesser quality film/video but even owning a dozen ALI dvds I had not seen them so I'm a happy camper for my 3 dollar investment!

Fans of Ali and particularly his work in the 60's should grab this while they can.",1279929600,4,660,4.32258064516129
8221993,3,B000WAU936,"With the exception of the four round Moore fight, these are all snippets and highlights of longer bouts.  Archie Moore at 48, one of the most brilliant and cunning light-heavies of all time decided to square off with a prime Cassius Clay and the results are sad.  It was Archie's last fight.  I would have liked to have seen more of the Ali/Floyd Patterson bout.  Floyd was a small heavy who was over-matched, but he still had fast hands and skills.  Real fight fans would always like to see old fights in their entirety.  Perhaps the producers of this DVD think attention spans are short and that's why they cut the fights to pieces?",1212019200,7,634,4.517543859649122
