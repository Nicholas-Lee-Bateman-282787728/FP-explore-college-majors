7834325,5,6302995922,"Of the many screen versions of this story, most viewers are probably familiar with the glossy Lana Turner soaper from the '60's. While Turner's performance as Madame X was admirable, the one to beat is this spellbinding turn by Gladys George. This version,in writing and acting styles, is of course more dated---it was released in 1937. (Today, a woman like Madame X would be a media darling, and probably have her own talk show.) Like the original play, this story is set in France----and we have to buy the main characters as being French, even though they speak with distinctly American accents, unlike the supporting cast around them. All of that is made believable, however, by the fine performances---with Miss George outdoing them all as the tragic fallen woman who sacrifices herself for her son. The ending is a killer, in every respect. This is an ""old movie"", to be sure,and Gladys George didn't make a lot of big ones....but she single-handedly makes this one a true classic.",1475539200,,987,4.880952380952381
7834326,5,6302995922,"""Madame X"" is a 1937 melodrama from Sam Wood based on a 1908 French play. It was filmed as early as 1916 and 1929, and would be done again in 1954, 1966, and 1981. The most famous version is the 1966 one with Lana Turner, but this one is far superior.

Gladys George (1904-54) plays Madame X. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Valiant is the Word for Carrie"" (1936) but is probably better known as Jimmy Cagney's moll from ""The Roaring Twenties"" (1939) or Humphrey Bogart's dead partner's wife from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). She is billed above the title on this one, and deservedly so. This is an excellent performance and it is uncanny how she ages 20 years not only in appearance, but in manner, voice, etc.

Warren William (1894-1948) plays George's husband, a wealthy lawyer who is too proud to forgive Madame X her trespass, setting in motion the sad story. William is probably best known for his role as d""Artagnan in ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) and as the first Perry Mason in a series of mid 30s films.

John Beal (1909-97) plays George's son. Beal made nearly 100 films between 1933 and 1993, usually as a second male lead and mostly in B films. He's probably best known for his role as Judge Vail in TV's ""Dark Shadow"" (1970-71). He is effective in this role, meant for Tyrone Power.

Henry Daniell (1894-1963) plays a sleazy blackmailer. He made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1964, often as a villain. He played Prof. Moriarty, Joseph Goebbels, and countless evil Englishmen.

Reginald Owen (1887-1972) plays a friend of the family. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971). He has the distinction of having played Sherlock Holmes (""A Study in Scarlet"") as well as Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes).

Sam Wood directs. Wood began his career as an assistant to Cecil B DeMille and started directing films in 1920. He hit his stride in the mid 30s with ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), and ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939) for which he received his first of 3 Oscar nominations. Among the 80 films he directed ""Kings Row"" (1942), ""Pride of the Yankees"" (1942) and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1943) stand out.

1937 was a pretty meager year in films. The top grossing films were ""Snow White"", ""Saratoga"", ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"", ""Topper"", and ""Wee Willie Winkie"". The Oscars went to ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""The Good Earth"" (Actress) and ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor). Other notable releases that year were ""Dead End"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"",  the Marx Brothers ""A Day at the Races"", and ""A Star is Born"". Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland made their first film together (""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"") and 17 year old Lana Turner appeared in ""They Won't Forget"" and became ""the Sweater girl"". Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.

Bottom line - a memorable tear jerker with great performances all around.",1375142400,,3047,4.733962264150944
7834327,3,6302995922,"seeing Gladys George start off in this movie as the wife of a wealthy French lawyer, since the only other two times I'd seen her, she was far less lofty: she's the Woman Who REALLY Loves James Cagney's Eddie Bartlett in ""The Roaring Twenties"" and has a much smaller role as Dana Andrews' broken down stepmother in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" . So here, she's the unfaithful wife who must leave her home never to return in order to protect her husband's career and her son's place in society. Warren Williams turns in an appropriately starchy performance as her unsympathetic husband, but it's Henry Daniell who really steals the show as a dastardly fellow blackmailing Madame X about her real identity. Not bad at all.",996710400,4,720,4.677165354330708
7834328,5,6302995922,"LA FEMME X, that glorious old potboiler of thwarted mother love, served as a triumphant vehicle for everyone from Sarah Bernhardt to Tuesday Weld (!!!), but no version plucks at the heartstrings more effectively than the Gladys George starrer.  Remembered by many moviegoers for her nightclub moll in THE ROARING TWENTIES, George had rare leading roles in this film and her Oscar-nominated VALIANT IS THE WORD FOR CARRIE, and she really brings home the bacon here.  Perhaps a trifle world-weary for the straying matron and dispossessed wife at the picture's beginning, she's perfect for the gin-soaked wandering years mid-film, and incredibly moving in her final scenes.  A rock would shed tears at Madame X's fate; Gladys George embraces and transcends the melodrama inherent in this role and makes it something human and real and aching.  If you like weepers, lay in a big supply of Kleenex before you pop this one in the VCR.",982281600,10,928,5.0064935064935066
