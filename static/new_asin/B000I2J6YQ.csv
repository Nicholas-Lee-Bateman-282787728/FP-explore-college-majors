2652252,5,B000I2J6YQ,This guy is great... he's like a Hispanic version of Tommy Davidson for anyone that remembers his awesome stand up act. The voices and singing he can do add so much to his already hilarious act. I own the first DVD and after seeing this on Comedy Central ordered this one. Great stuff!,1163721600,6,285,4.39622641509434
2652253,5,B000I2J6YQ,"if you like immature humor(not like lameoid CArlos Mencia) this guy will have you cryin tears of laughter. I  had the privledge of watching him in Irvine CA(where he did the same bits) and it was hilarious. I was dying of laughter.  I saw the CC special were they edited  stuff but i guarantee the stuff you didn't see( which you will here) will  be  worth buying the dvd.
 PABLO IS THE MAN
 n/m the old timee review",1163548800,8,416,4.256410256410256
2652254,5,B000I2J6YQ,I don't know what those other people were talking about who reviewed this-Pablo is freakin hysterical. Especially on this DVD. Maybe they needed a slower paced brand of comedy like Carlos Mencia. If you want to seriously crack up get both of his DVDs.,1163548800,6,251,4.7272727272727275
2652255,1,B000I2J6YQ,"His jokes are awful.  He starts up one idea, (ie: Jakie Chan plays very similar characters in all his movies.) and then proceeds to do a stereotypical Asian accent where he states what he is doing as he plays Jakie Chan.  And it goes on, and on, and on, and on for like 15 min +. What he is doing is not funny, original, fresh or new, and he simply assumes if he moves more, and yells louder it will become funny.  BTW, this is his whole act.  The majority of his jokes make fun of Asian people.  Now I don't want it to seem like I did not think it was funny because I was offended.  I love controversial humor....  When its funny(Borat, Carlos Mencia, Dave Chappell, South Park).  Pablo comes off like a hyper active  old off his meds. If you want to watch a comedian sweet like a sprinkler and laugh, watch ""Robbin Williams Live on Broadway.""",1163462400,2,844,4.225
2652256,1,B000I2J6YQ,"I seen this when it aired on Comedy Central.  Let me correct myself, I watched the first 15-20 minutes of it and did not laugh once.  The crowd at the performace laughed, I am guessing to be polite, but I found it very unfunny.  Maybe it got better after I turned it off, but I had already wasted time that I could have spent talking to myself...and I am not all that interesting.",1163462400,2,380,4.178082191780822
2652294,5,B000I2J6YQ,I would have to say that Pablo Francisco is a very original comedian.  His impersonations are on the dot and his jokes are spicy.  He is a light-hearted racist.  I loved all of his references to movies and actors.  William Hung impersonation is also very funny and crude,1245110400,,270,4.5625
2652295,5,B000I2J6YQ,"Love it. If you are already a Pablo Francisco fan, this is a great addition to your DVD collection.",1210377600,,99,4.2631578947368425
2652296,4,B000I2J6YQ,"Have always been a fan of pablo francisco.
Absolutely loved the way he used the voice to create all the funny sounds.

His wicked sense of humor is really funny too.
Would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is in a moody state to have a quick cheer-me-up! :)

Ming Chern",1210377600,,282,4.403846153846154
2652297,1,B000I2J6YQ,"Pablo, you are hilarious!!!  So why would you put out a second DVD with the same material but not as funny.  This DVD is nothing but a cash grab and Pablo should be ashamed.  Needless to say, I will not be buying anything from Pablo Francisco again.  Buy his first one instead and avoid this one.",1209859200,,296,4.232142857142857
2652298,4,B000I2J6YQ,"This new dvd of pablo is funny but not as funny as his earlier specials. The stand up starts getting funny 15 minutes into the show. So you are already losing your money's worth. In my opinion the first few minutes the jokes were weak and not so funny but after that, get ready to laugh your butt off.",1199664000,,301,4.11864406779661
2652299,5,B000I2J6YQ,I highly recommend this!!! He's very funny and you will not stop laughing from the moment you start till it ends.,1190592000,,113,4.428571428571429
2652300,1,B000I2J6YQ,I've seen many of Pablo's performances but this one was just bad. I think he is hilarious especially with a lot of his impersonations but this was just bad. I don't know if he had an off night or what but 25 mins into it....I had to turn it off. I would look at other dvd's of his...definitely not this one.,1190505600,2,307,4.049180327868853
2652301,2,B000I2J6YQ,"Pablo what happened? Where's all the funny stuff you did on the first DVD (Bits and Pieces). I Loved the first DVD so much me and my friends actually quote alot of the material. It seems like Comedy Central had held Pablo back quite a bit. Alot of the material was not funny, or he would make comments that had little to no relevance of the joke he was making. The Jackie Chan and China town skit was really drawn out and very irritating ""Leave Me Alone"".. It just wasn't funny. The Brokeback Mountain Skit was entertaining as well as the William Hung and Ecstacy in South Beach. But this DVD does not even compare to his first... What a bummer.. But I still like you Pablo, your still my number 7 friend on Myspace..!",1189468800,,718,4.325925925925926
2652302,5,B000I2J6YQ,"Some say thats is the same jokes from the first DVD but updated. I think its all new, yes you can find relations to some of them but there is plenty of new material. Including you can notice that he tries to avoid the movie voice guy and the ""roommate"" stories got way better. Some of you will try a few of the things he says out and if that is not enough in the extras of the DVD when they show his house you get to see an actual bottle of HUEVO SPLASH ""you sexy mother fu****"" hehehe.",1189296000,,486,3.919191919191919
2652303,1,B000I2J6YQ,"I chose to purchase this DVD based on other reviews, and that he received good reviews for his appearance on the Three Amigos DVD (comedy with Carlos Mencia/Freddy Soto).  TOTALLY don't get how this got even 1 star...let alone 4 and 5! Maybe I'm just getting old! :)  My 18 and 20 year old found it funny...but me and my husband just didn't get it.",1188259200,,348,4.338461538461538
2652324,5,B000I2J6YQ,Arrived in good timing with no damages to the DVD or the casing in other words in new condition.  Great comedy and tons of laughter recommended for young adults.,1187827200,,161,4.551724137931035
2652325,3,B000I2J6YQ,"Pablo cranks out some new funny, going off about Goth people, Superheroes as cockblocks, Brokeback Mountain, and a bunch of other stuff you haven't heard on 'Bits & Pieces'.

If you love Pablo, get this DVD. If you're new to him, get the aforementioned one first.",1179273600,,263,4.717391304347826
2652326,5,B000I2J6YQ,Pablo can do more voices than any comedian I've ever seen!  His material is non-stop laughter and my friends and I can't get enough.  I think Pablo will become a household name soon because he's a genius.,1174867200,,204,4.486486486486487
2652327,1,B000I2J6YQ,this was not funny at all.i've seen pablo francisco's stand-up on HBO and was pleasantly entertained but this dvd was awful and boring as hell.,1173312000,,143,4.76
2652328,5,B000I2J6YQ,his video is so funny. Worth every bit. Pablo had me laughing until my face was hurting. Great job Pablo. I recommend the video.,1173139200,2,128,4.375
2652329,5,B000I2J6YQ,"Pablo is hysterical....!  His sense of humor,,,the sounds that he makes,,,,the imitations of ""Rosa"", his ""Roommate"", the ""Mexican Music"", the ""Techno club"",,,,and on and on....are the best!!  ""Ouch"" is another one of the best!!! Don't ever stop doing what you do, Pablo!",1168819200,2,270,5.404761904761905
2652330,5,B000I2J6YQ,i bought this dvd as a gift for a friend .. and we watched it together and its endless fun! Its seriously hilarious! ... pablo francisco is just awesome!!,1168300800,2,154,4.344827586206897
2652331,2,B000I2J6YQ,"This was a definite let down.  It is too bad that Pablo's first DVD since Bits & Pieces cannot nearly hold a candle.  Bits & Pieces was far more funny, enjoyable, and original.  I have seen him live once and am going to see him again in a couple of weeks.  Hopefully it won't be the same garbage.  If you are looking to laugh your butt off, don't purchase this DVD, purchase Bits & Pieces.",1168300800,2,389,4.133333333333334
2652332,1,B000I2J6YQ,"This was just embarrasing to watch, this guy is so uncool. this DVD was released in late 2006, and this guy is making jokes about a Cher video that came out in 1989. I bet some people watching this weren't even born when that came out. What other cutting edge jokes does he have? Beverly Hills 90210. When was that popular, around 1991? And Jackie Chan? Who cares? I didn't laugh once, and actually got up to turn off the DVD and throw it in the trash. The voices would be kind of funny for a minute, but he runs them into the ground.",1165795200,2,534,4.144230769230769
2652333,5,B000I2J6YQ,"I saw Pablo's CC special awhile ago when it first aired and kept up with other tv appearances like Jay Leno..and thought he was absolutely hilarious.

I showed his clips to my friends and they loved his act as well.

I got to see his live act and got to meet him back in Oct. and he definitely lived up to my expectations!

I saw his latest special on CC and had to buy this dvd as Christmas gifts for my friends.

Huge Fan of Pablo!",1165017600,7,433,4.0
8143473,5,B000I2J6YQ,One of his funniest sets ever!!,1484524800,,31,4.333333333333333

8143478,4,B000I2J6YQ,"First time I watched this guy perform on stage, it was called bits and pieces, that was so funny to me I've seen it several times. So i had to buy this one and his other 2 shows. These prices are cheap for how much you can laugh out of it.",1369267200,,239,3.7058823529411766
8143479,5,B000I2J6YQ,"I laughed so hard I almost soiled myself, really.  Pablo is painfully funny, this is, in my opinion, his funnest work. The part talking about old people getting it on just kills me every time.",1357948800,,192,4.485714285714286
8143480,5,B000I2J6YQ,"i first heard of pablo on just for laughs comedy festival of montreal.  years later, i forgot all about him, but i was on you tube just looking up comedians, and lo and behold there's Pablo.  the thing about Pablo, is that he says things people can relate to, he makes fun of nationalities, ethnic groups, and teenage girls.  i laughed my head off the whole time, it started to hurt. this is definitely one to have in a collection",1311811200,,430,4.35
