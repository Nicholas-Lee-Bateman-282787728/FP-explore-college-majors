7823376,5,6302265851,"There are 2 Episodes on this tape and one has Sonny & Cher. It is called ""The Hot Number Affair"" Episode and truly wonderful:

It shows Cher true-to-life, showing her initial interest in designing, right when her career in music had just begun to take off. And Sonny, WAY against character, is playing a tailor who is NOT married to her, but he is able to bank his jealousy.

In a way that makes for quite an interesting and comedic plot, with physics secrets, relating to Cold War with Russia of the 60's, undertones woven into a unusually styled, dress.

This is a definite must for people who are in love with the remarkable TONE of the voice of Cher, as a young star, with their song playing a bit in the background, but tastefully. I like anything with young Sonny & Cher but this is truly a hard to find treasure!

I also adore ""The Suburbia Affair"" Episode on this tape. A little deep with the math and the hiding of a nuclear researcher in suburbia but funny too, with some amazing milk trucks and milk men, from the 60's when they delivered to your door. The chase scenes are pretty good and some people getting sick from fumes in the lights is an interesting spy twist~~

Good segment and so humanly typical of the ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"" team--like when the other throws out the bread thinking it is a bomb but the partner really ordered a loaf of rye...The lady is such a Leave-it-To-Beaver-type woman and that makes it so Brady-Bunchy. I think the older kids of today may have a few good laughs at some of these non-R type scenes. My 8 year-old would laugh and laugh at certain parts.

The neighborhood looks an awful lot like the first neighborhood Sonny & Cher lived in before moving into Tony Curtis' place, according to the jackets of their LP's when they got their start: I had to wonder if there was any connection to this film location and them. (Besides the fact that they guest star on the joint episode on this great, classic VHS).",1206403200,2,1951,4.450980392156863
7823377,4,6302265851,"The Hot Number Affair is an episode about a dress( a hot number) with a pattern that is a secret code and the Thrush people want it. This episode is built around pop singing duo Sonny And Cher who play Jerry and Ramona. Ramona(Cher) wears the ""hot number"" and doesn't remember where she left it until it's brought in from the cleaners. Jerry(Sonny Bono) designed the hot number that Ramona wears and Jerry has a crush on Ramona. The popular Sonny and Cher song ""I Got You Babe"" plays in the background. The stock music uses kazoos throughout the episode which may be irritating to some but I found it to be humorous.
  ""The Suburbia Affair"" has Napoleon and Illya move temporarily to the suburbs. These two guys even divide up the household duties on cooking and cleaning. The so-called milkman sends them milk that appears to blowup. What a mess for them to clean up. Illya even gets to drive a ice cream truck. In one scene Napoleon and Illya almost sound like an old married couple when they begin to argue. I've seen a episode guide on ""The Hot Number Affair"" as an worst offering of the series. To me it's not that bad of an episode for 1967 compared to what tv executives put on nowadays.",1020038400,7,1194,4.447488584474886
