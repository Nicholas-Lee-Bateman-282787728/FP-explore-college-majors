It is b/w footage with the counter on the screen. It has mostly back and side camera angles.
The vocals are near impossible to hear at times over the guitar.

The dvd also contains other footage from Ed Sullivan 1969, Music Scene ABC TV 1969, Johnny Cash 1969,
and Promotional Film 1969. Audio Video varies on these from 5-9",1349481600,7,396,4.28
