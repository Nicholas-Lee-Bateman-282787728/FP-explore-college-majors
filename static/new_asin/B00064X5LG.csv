2168394,3,B00064X5LG,Goes to my collection. Had great effects. If you like fast drama on giant animals these are great. We enjoyed it,1358553600,,112,4.380952380952381
2168395,3,B00064X5LG,"I did not buy this dvd for myself but for a 14 year old nephew. It is not my cup of tea, he however loved it.",1356652800,,109,3.230769230769231
2168396,5,B00064X5LG,"These 2 movies are the best in the series with great animatronics and CGI. Great actors with great storylines. Anaconda is about a documentary crew searching for an Amazonian tribe while ""helping"" a poacher that needs a ride. Trouble starts as a crew member is fatally injured in an accident. Now they need to travel to help with the legend of the Giant Anaconda coming true. Anaconda Hunt for the Blood Orchid is about a pharmaceutical crew having to get their secret chemical for cell life fresh from the flower itself in the asian jungle of Borneo with the only Captain, and his friend, crazy enough to go down river in the rainy season. After the Doctors bribe, they crash and get stuck in the middle of the deadly proof of the secret chemical. Giant Anacondas created by prolonged cell life, meaning they have been alive long enough to never stop growing. Get these movies. It is worth it.",1344211200,,894,4.628930817610063

2168398,3,B00064X5LG,"I love campy horror flicks, and this was worth the money I paid.  The first one was good, the second one could have used better writers who knew how to research their stuff.  There were a lot of mistakes. (I know, what am I doing expecting a little reality in my monster snake movies.)  Anyway, still worth the money.",1273622400,,317,4.338983050847458
2168399,4,B00064X5LG,"This is the most exciting movies ever!  However, there is still room for improvement.  The biggest flaw is the pretty much expected ending.  Upon seeing the cliff with the anacondas at the bottom, people can usually guess who is going to fall in ""in the end"".",1103760000,,259,4.586956521739131

8038626,5,B00064X5LG,"This was a 2 disc movie.  A double feature.  The color was great and the sound was perfect.  I could hear all the jungle sounds clearly.  These movies were about giant anacondas and their hostility toward humans.  Nightmarish, but I enjoyed both of them.",1405036800,,254,4.681818181818182
