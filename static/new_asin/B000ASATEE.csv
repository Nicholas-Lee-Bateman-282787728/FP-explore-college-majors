2391606,5,B000ASATEE,"i saw this show about 5 years ago on tv, and until now i had forgotten almost everything about the series. I recently bought this dvd set a couple of weeks ago and im soo glad i did. This was my favorite anime back 5 years ago, and I would have to say it still is my favorite. Everything from the animations to the story is simply phenominal, and would I recommend this dvd set to any anime fan!!",1181520000,,396,4.025316455696203
2391607,5,B000ASATEE,"Kenshin is among the best animes ever produced. The story is epic and it has plenty of side story humor. The characters for both the good guys and the badguys are not generic typical people. Most of them have a complete past and a story behind them that makes all of them unique.

I gave this Anime a rating of 5 stars for the following reasons:

1.)Completed story

2.)Character uniqueness

3.)Side story humor

4.)Believability (I admit the sword fighting can seem over the top but I am refering to the stories.)

5.)Knowledge (it may seem somewhat silly but this anime is packed with excellent qualities. plus the characters make mistakes and work to correct them, nobody is perfect and it points that in their constant vigilance in making up for what they have done wrong.)

I strongly recommend Season one and Season two of Rurouni Kenshin. Season 3 has the lowest rating becuase the storyline is somewhat generic and the characters are not particularly amazing. This is amazing work and I would advise adding it to any anime collection. Worth every penny.

2391608,4,B000ASATEE,The uncut version of the show is much better than what was on tv.  The fights made more since and the jokes are funnier.  If you liked the tv show you will love this.,1167868800,5,166,3.8529411764705883
2391609,5,B000ASATEE,"This is another of the great classics of Anime. It combines several major elements (love, philosophy, and action) to form a story that is entertaining while still captivating and profound.

While there is some violence, this is a rare gem among anime in that there is nothing perverse or offensive thrown in to water it down. It sticks to its purpose and doesn't pander to baser interests.

The story spends the right amount of time developing its characters, keeping the cast relatively small so the series isn't devoted to constant introductions, but large enough for variety. It then leaves itself plenty of time to explore its characters and their past, and does a good job of moving between them.

Perhaps most interesting is the philosophy. Samurai are famous for being ""poet warriors"", possessing both a fighting spirit and a sense of deeper truths. This is expressed beautifully in Kenshin's persona and behavior, not merely in speech, but in his methods and actions.

This is one story that made me feel I had truely gained something of value by watching it.",1162080000,36,1067,4.911111111111111
2391610,5,B000ASATEE,This is a great series to spend your money; it is worth it! It has action as well as romance and comedy.

Iam an anime fanactic especially when it comes to story lines that has a little bit of romance and comedy but I'm don't like much action... it seems to boring and serious... but this is different.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative.

2391659,4,B000ASATEE,"I bought this season because I loved it as a kid on Toonami and I wanted to completely and fully rewatch it, which I still will be but purchasing it from Rightstuf as they have much cheaper prices for this season and the second one.

I rate the anime itself 5 stars but I give the packaging/case a 2/5 at the most, my reasons being I received my copy brand new, I opened it up the day after it arrived in the mail to the surprise that all 6 of the discs are literally stacked on-top of each other in the set which I thought was absolutely ridiculous because it can and did damage the discs themselves, it is annoying if I want to watch say the 5th disc, I have to remove the 4 discs above that one to get to what I want, didn't like that. I took out the first disc to watch it and I noticed the 2nd disc was incredibly scratched up on the top side of it (it was a different type of DVD disc too unlike the other five, it seemed to be the 'older' type of disc if that makes any sense, like a ""first print"" type of thing) and the bottom of the disc seemed to have slight finger marks like someone was handling it before me. But as I said, this was a brand new copy I bought from an official website, not a bootleg or anything like that. This only really effected my rating for this item because I like all of my anime/manga items in perfect condition.

Media Blasters / AnimeWorks just seems to take no pride in their items packaging I guess, I looked it up and others seem to have problems with their cases and whatnot. The dub of the anime is fantastic though, and a classic series which I would suggest to anyone who likes samurai/action animes.",1321315200,2,1646,4.108695652173913
2391660,5,B000ASATEE,"First of all, this set is Season 1, which is episodes 1-27. The best season is season 2, so if you've watched this one and are wondering if you should continue, the answer is yes! (However, forego season 3.)

Rurouni Kenshin is based on the manga by Nobuhiro Watsuki. The first 62 episodes follow the manga up to book 18 (the manga goes to 28), and the last 33 episodes (the 3rd season) are filler episodes (not based on the manga). While the filler episodes are OK, the series is great! The voice actors for the English and Japanese language are pretty good, and their lines (for both languages) are good too. Minor characters sometimes have really annoying voices in the English dub, and the filler episodes may make you cringe, but overall it's good and quite entertaining to watch. The first ending and beginning credits are done in English if you watch it in English, which is pretty fun (the ending is sung by Sanosuke's English voice actor), but all the ending and beginning credits are good -- I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-Theme-Collection/dp/B000058A7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best Theme Collection</a>.

Now for the series itself.
Himura Kenshin was once a Hitokiri Battosai, or man-slayer (kind of like an assassin), fighting for the revolution that proceeds the Meiji era. Now he is a ronin, or wandering samurai, who wears a reverse-blade sword and has made a vow never to kill.
Kamiya Kaoru owns a dojo that was once her father's, and tries to scrape a living by teaching others the Kamiya Kashin style of sword-fighting.
The two meet up when a man claiming to be the famous Battosai starts terrorizing the town and also claims to use the Kamiya Kashin style. Kaoru, angry at him for using the name of her sword style to kill, goes after him, even though she has no idea what he looks like. She runs into Kenshin, and since he's wearing a sword, she accuses him of being the Battosai. Once he's proved he's only a ronin, she goes after the real imposter. He's a bit much for her, though, and Kenshin comes to her rescue.

That's only the beginning. Kenshin stalls his wandering for a while to stay at the Kamiya dojo, and they go through many adventures. In one of the early ones they rescue a thief, Yahiko, whom Kaoru takes on as her student. Later on they meet Sagara Sanosuke, or hired sword 'Zanza', who has been hired to kill Kenshin. Some time after that they help a woman named Megumi, who sticks around.

The last story plot (in season 2) is the Kyoto arc, where Kenshin must battle Makoto Shishio before he [Shishio] can go through with his plans to take over Japan. It's at the beginning of this plot Kenshin meets Hajime Saito, one of the Shinsengumi during the revolution, and later he meets the girl ninja Misao.
Kenshin's going to need all the allies he has, because he's got a whole lot of enemies.

There is a lot of fighting in this series (except for important fights that fighting is mostly just flashes of light), but it's also a romance, and there are a lot of places where you'll laugh. And if you see the series and want to know what happens next, all 28 volumes of the manga have been released in the U.S.! I enjoy both reading the manga and watching the series. I really wish a less-expensive anime complete collection set would be released... but for now, this set or the Premium set are probably your best choices.",1296432000,,3426,4.722408026755853
2391681,5,B000ASATEE,I love story lines with a positive message or lesson behind them. I first found Rurouni Kenshin  through the Samurai X oav collection (Which is phenomenal) i highly recommend samurai x .. even if you don't want the tv series.  however I enjoyed every episode of rurouni Kenshin. Its a really cool  and interesting look at the mejing era. and how many samurai dealt with the new era...the first season set  up some really interesting story lines  for the second season which is awesome!,1273536000,,485,4.726190476190476
2391682,5,B000ASATEE,"Picture this: a feminine-looking, goofy swordsman who has vowed not to kill, but is secretly a lethal ex-assassin known as Battosai the Manslayer.

Yep, the title character of Nobuhiro Watsuki's ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is a pretty unusual lead for an action series, but then this series is really rather unusual -- a meditation on changing times, and on fighting to preserve peace and life rather than to bring death. ""Rurouni Kenshin - Season One"" is a brilliant combination of sword-swinging action, delightfully wacky humor and a teeny hint of romance. Okay, more than a hint.

Searching for the legendary manslayer Battosai, a young dojo owner named Kaoru assaults a sword-carrying stranger whom she assumes is the one she's searching for. Turns out his sword blade is upside-down, and he insists that he's just a wandering swordsman who won't kill anybody. Unfortunately someone using the name Battosai is disgracing Kaoru's dojo -- and they have their eyes on revenge for an old wrong.

It's only then that the mysterious Kenshin shows what he's really capable of, and who he really is -- the true Battosai.  Kaoru asks him to stay on, and they're soon joined by Yahiko and Sanosuke, a teenage ex-pickpocket and a young ""fight merchant.""

Among the other problems: a corrupt assassin who is murdering officials, corrupt police, a bogus faith healer, a sumo wrestler being bullied by his peers, a teacher being forced to take up his sword again, a band of treacherous pirates who capture Kenshin, train robberies, circus sabotage, an old friend of Sano's who is bent on vengance, and a fanatical swordsman who wants to make a warrior kingdom. On the grimmest note, they clash with an amoral businessman who is forcing a young doctor to create a super-potent opium... and has hired the Oniwaban Group (ninjas) to enforce his will.

Based on Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga, ""Rurouni Kenshin"" has become a classic for its story about overcoming the past, fighting for the sake of peace, and for the setting of the early Meiji era -- when Japan awkwardly leapt forward technologically and socially. But on a less epic scale, it's about one young man with a terrible and bloody past, who is now atoning for his past deeds by using his sword to protect instead of to destroy.

The first season starts off fairly light-hearted, but gradually gains some darker shadings (the whole opium subplot) and explores the sociopolitical corruption and strife of all these sweeping changes (Sanosuke's tragic captain Sagara). And obviously any series with a swordsman is going to have some action, and these scenes deliver a whirlwind of sword blows and superhuman leaps, which can do anything from smashing an opponent's arm to hammering a crowd of people to the ground.

But there's also plenty of comic relief in here, usually supplied by Kaoru's short fuse (and her perpetual spats with Yahiko and Sano), and Kenshin's sheepish space-cadet attitude and tendency to get in trouble by doing the right thing.

Kenshin is a lovable, rather odd hero -- he's goofy, spacey, eager to please and polite to a fault, with rumpled red hair and threadbare clothes. But when he fights seriously, he gets creepy empty eyes. Kaoru is blunt and strong-willed but also quite kind, while Yahiko is a sharp-tongued, good-hearted kid. And Sanosuke makes a good addition to round out the cast -- he's got a tragic past as part of the unjustly-maligned Sekihotai ""false army,"" but with Kenshin's influence he begins to move on.

The first season of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is a mixture of more lighthearted filler and darker, bloodier arcs from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga. A brilliant classic anime.",1263254400,2,3648,4.985197368421052
2391683,5,B000ASATEE,"Complete season one. High quality with a good translation, English dubbed or Japanese with subtitles. Its a bit annoying how Kenshin speaks half the time (in the subtitles) , ""I will go with you, that I will"" is an example. But since it it not the case when he gets serious or with any of the other characters at any time, I'm sure its done with good reason. It stopped bothering me after the first few episodes. There are tons of extras including linear notes which explains the context and history of what happens in the series. For example if there is a reference to the Boshin Wars then the linear notes will provide a short history of it to help you understand Kenshin's context. Extra's also include fanart etc. A really good buy if you are a fan.",1263254400,,753,4.424460431654676
2391684,1,B000ASATEE,"i jus finished watching the first season and all i feel is disappointment...the storyline was good, but the action, as little as there was, was awful and it was not as exciting as everyone says it is...it is childish and boring...i recommend to jus watch the ova's, they are awesome and extremely action packed...so pretty much jus save your money and use on a series worth watching...like full metal alchemist or bleach....",1261094400,,424,4.902777777777778

The 6 disks are NOT numbered, but you can sortof tell by the positioning of the disks in the box.  There is also a tital on each disk to give you a rough idea of what's on it.

The story has a pretty good conclusion (for season 1) it doesn't leave on a cliffhanger.. although there is more to the story and it shows that.",1254009600,2,544,4.454545454545454
2391686,4,B000ASATEE,"...Although when I bought it, the price was much higher.

To tell the truth, almost eighty percent of my admiration for the Rurouni Kenshin anime centers on season two. But season one is a fun series of episodic adventures that adequately introduces the characters and themes that the second season's epic story arc centers on, and watching it will help you appreciate that second season all the more.

My biggest complaint with this season is that the artwork and animation tends to be somewhat lackluster, especially early on, which is a shame when you consider that one of the highest points to the source manga is its fantastic artwork.

That said, many of the story arcs that appear in the manga have their events and even character motivations greatly altered for the anime, something that may be consider either a positive or a negative. While in some cases I consider the manga rendition more pleasantly down-to-earth, the anime holds its own in the storytelling department and offers a refreshing alternative take on the stories that keeps reading the manga *and* watching the anime from being terribly redundant. Of particular note are the first episode and the late-season Raijuta story-arc, both of which are almost completely different from the manga originals.

There are also a fair number of extra filler episodes, most of which occurs in the time between the ""Megumi"" story arc and the ""Raijuta"" story arc. They're fun episodes and give a little character development to some of the supporting cast, but don't really lend much to overall theme or plot.

While nowhere near the best anime out there, season one of Rurouni Kenshin is a charming and entertaining choice. It was an especially nostalgic experience for me, as I remember watching this show back when it showed on Toonami (you know, when Cartoon Network was actually decent). I recommend it to any anime fan who doesn't have a better anime series to blow money on at the moment.

A few gripes, though. First off, there's no indication on the disc labels as to what order they should be viewed in--no numbers, just the titles of the individual DVD releases the collection contains. This shouldn't be a problem unless you're stupid enough to take more than one disc out of the case at once for no reason at all. Also, I found it jarring how they just stopped using the English versions of the opening and closing songs for no discernible reason about three-quarters through the season, reverting to subtitled versions of the original Japanese songs. It's a shame, 'cause I think the English versions actually sound better--but that's just me.",1247702400,,2617,4.909502262443439
2391687,4,B000ASATEE,"I purchased the box set of Wandering Samurai because I have always enjoyed the series and this was a good price. I think I was expecting the usual type of box set packaging, with a booklet that listed episodes and numbered discs, this is not what I got. This box contains all of the discs for Season One, there are 6. Basically they are the same discs that you get if you buy them individually. The discs are titled, but not numbered, and there are no inserts in the packaging to tell you which order you should watch them in. I ended up putting them in my player in an order that I guessed at, then had to check the episode numbers on the main menu to see if I was right. The show itself of course is wonderful. The historical details are one of the aspects of the show that I find so intriguing. The turmoil and confusion between the ideals of a new nation and the practice of it are a really great backdrop for the series. The characters in the series are well developed. Some of the episodes are a little goofy, but loveable. One thing I like about the first season is that it prepares you well, without you even realizing it, to enter into the much more serious Kyoto arc.

I personally think that this series is more so for people of older ages, just because of the violent content but I'm sure that people of all ages can enjoy and appreciate this animation.

The scene is set in an era of Japan when Imperialism was on the rise while the dreams of Capitalism is in the minds of the common man. Several conflicts arise between the Patriots and the Traditionalists, and bloodshed is spread throughout the land.  In this land, the legendary assasin, Battousai, carved the way for the Imperialistic ways, but disappeared immediately after the revolution.  Assistant kendo instructor,Kaoru Kamiya, is distressed when a man begins killing innocents in her father's sword school's name.  The man claims to be Battousai.  Kaoru begins searching for this 'Battousai' and stumbles upon Kenshin the Wanderer.  After a rough encounter, she realizes that 'Rurouni Kenshin' is just a kind simpleton, and has nothing to do with the killings.  She invites Kenshin into her home after saving her life, but soon discovers he is the true Battousai! Kenshin assures her that he has changed his ways, and now will devote his reverse-bladed sword to save lives instead of taking them.  The action, humor, and growing romances are not to be missed!

Season 1 and season 2 are a must see, and if you're gonna get those two, you'll also want to get season 3 to complete the series (even though season 3 isn't as good as the other two).

2391708,5,B000ASATEE,"Rurouni Kenshin is in my opinion one of the greatest anime cartoons that i've seen. Honorable, honest, and sticks to his word (not killing anymore) is some qualities he has that not many people use in todays world and that's what makes him unique. I am definitely going to get the rest of the series.",1187827200,,300,4.472727272727273
2391709,5,B000ASATEE,"Have never been a big fan of anime in the past, though I think the images from Pokemon were the limit of my experience.  Rurouni Kenshin is awesome!  It has really serious themes, but deals with everything with lots of humor.  I especially like the emphasis on repentance and reparation as being superior (though also more difficult) to despair and suicide.

Even though Kenshin is the focus of the series and is way cool, all the characters are well developed and important.  I highly recommend this fun series!",1186617600,,512,4.7727272727272725
2391710,4,B000ASATEE,"This anime is a really great investment. The English dub is not that bad, and the story itself is just captivating. I'll definitely be purchasing the second season in the future.
My only complaint would be, that I picked free shipping, and when the package got here, the corner of the box was broken, so it doesn't snap shut on the bottom.",1185926400,,339,4.483870967741935

It's definitely worth purchasing simply for how amazing this show actually is, but be aware that the distributor really cut corners with this one.",1499385600,,317,4.678571428571429

8079492,5,B000ASATEE,"Rurouni Kenshin is, to me, one of the greatest samurai series ever made. Vol one gives you a complete understanding of the characters and build up for what has happened, and will happen.

Vol 1 and 2 are classics and deserve to be in every anime collectors collection.
I also recommend getting samurai X ova series. That ova series is one of the top 5 greatest samurai animes period.",1466640000,,383,4.550724637681159
8079493,4,B000ASATEE,"I'll skip the series since most of the people here already know the series. Basically everything about the dvds were satisfactory, but the one issue i had was that the disc weren't numbered. This made it a little hard to remember which disc was next. Other than that it was everything i wanted. Rurouni kenshin is one of my all time favorite animes so i was worried that the high price wasn't going to be worth the quality if the product, but I wasn't disappointed. If you're a rurouni kenshin fan and want to own the series this set should be just what you're looking for!",1458604800,,573,4.415094339622642
