7978750,3,B000083XJ3,Nice to see O-Sensei and very happy to discover the founder of Aikido .Unfortunatly it is just a mix of old footage without sound and without any comments or explanation .For historic purposes only.,1120780800,,198,4.852941176470588

DVD Volume one starts with a footage of an Aikido class in the 1930' in Iwana (?). We can see Saito Sensei Uchi Deshi with O Sensei, then we see footage of O Sensei in his latest years also with Saito Sensei assisting in supersing a class and with the first Doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba.

We also see Tohei Sensei, and a boken demonstration with O Sensei and Tamura Sensei.

We can see O Sensei in Iwana training, praying and drinking tea with wife Hatsu.

This DVD shows that O Sensei was truly living his art, and that his training was rigourous and constant (a great lesson for practitioners)

The DVD ended and I wanted to see more of it... Great and recommended purchase

I am looking foward to viewing Volume two...",1109635200,,905,4.2631578947368425
7978752,5,B000083XJ3,"This dvd, along with part two, is an excellent documentary of aikido's founder. There is no narration, and the music can get cheesy, but if you have a sense for what aikido is about, or just physics in general, this set is for you! The footage is black adn white, often of poor quality, but still a gem in the rough for all enthusiasts.

I would also suggest that you purchase the three disc set of Yoshinkan aikido founder Shioda Gozo, which is in part bi lingual, english-japanese, although the master sessions with Gozo are not translated or subtitled. The main point of what he says, however, is that if you just master the basics, you can do everything.",1104192000,,658,4.529411764705882
7978753,5,B000083XJ3,This is like the best footage I have seen with Morihei Ueshiba. Many of his techniques are beyond reproach and seem nearly invisible. Totally awesome stuff. Highly informative and I?m sure will be great in anyone?s video collection that is into Aikido,1090281600,,251,5.0
