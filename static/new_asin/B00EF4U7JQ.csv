It is good for adults based on some of the topics and language used.  It is a lot of fun to watch and the characters are very dynamic in acting out their roles.  This set is beautifully packaged like you would like to see a collectors set. The outer case is a pink case that looks like a leather purse and the inside even is made to look like leopard shin.  There are 10 disks and they are 20 hours and 35 minutes long. I show the disks and the packaging in the attached video so please take a look at it.

Here is what is on each disk:
1. Season One plus outtakes
2. Season Two plus outtakes
3. Season Three plus outtakes
4. Season Four
5. New York Special The Last Shout plus outtakes
6. Season Five Episodes 1 through 6
7. Season Five episodes 7 and 8 plus outtakes
8. 20th Anniversary specials
9. Bonus material
10. New bonus material

The quality of the video is very well done and it looks like it has been enhanced.  I especially like that the disks have subtitles on them.  Sometimes the accents and slang of British humor are hard for me to understand and I like the capability to be able to read the subtitles. Sometimes they just talk too fast! This series is very funny and hilarious.  It is great to have the entire series and specials all on one disk set.  Once you start viewing them you will not be able to stop.

Seasons 1 to 3 are all presented in small screen format but in high quality.  The other seasons are all presented in 16:9 formats including the new 20th anniversary specials and the new bonus material disk. Disk 9 is older bonus material so it is in the smaller screen format.  All the disks have subtitles but the outtake videos do not have subtitles. I liked this series a lot and so did my wife.  I rated it as a 5 star item.  This set makes a great gift for those that like British sitcom humor.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1386201600,110,2332,4.941025641025641
5911127,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"This was not what I was expecting.  Reading some reviews, I was a little worried to receive this over the Internet, but I did it anyway.  I'm so glad I didn't wait!  Looking at the Product Image, I was expecting the DVD Set to be as large as, say, ""Sex and The City"" (that packaging is huge!)  It's not- it's sort and thick, which is perfect for storing and moving!  The DVDs were in a plastic tray securely, and overall, I am very happy with both the product and the presentation.

If you're an AbFab fan, you have GOT to have this ,sweetie darling!",1383955200,13,550,4.240384615384615
5911128,2,B00EF4U7JQ,"The episodes look very good. You can tell there has been work done on them. The packaging is not user friendly. The discs are kept in a case that resides in a purse. It is difficult to get the case out of the purse. The discs are not well situated in the case. When I opened the case, one of the discs popped up. Some of the discs are difficult to take out, and the packaging has some of the discs on top of each other. It's very annoying.

The ""Absolutely All of It"" is untrue for the ""Birthing"" episode. The Chicago musical number is still edited out. This is a big disappointment, and since the cost of the set is high, they should have paid for the rights.",1383868800,66,660,4.116279069767442
5911129,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"I just finished viewing the first 2 disc and just loving it.
  But I also have to say that I'm very pleased that subtitles were available.
My hearing is not what it used to be and by not being totally familar with British slang,  the subtitles just make a great show even better for me. Because of this,  I'm catching a lot that I missed in previous viewings which just adds to the enjoyment.
  Thanks so much for including them in this set.",1383868800,42,441,4.253012048192771

5911133,1,B00EF4U7JQ,"I LOVE British comedy, but I don't understand how anyone with even a smidgen of brain power can find this show funny AT ALL!!!!!!! I've seen older eps when I dated a British guy back in the 90s, and they were funnier than the $&#% I just watched, but they were NO WHERE NEAR worth 5 stars in any way, shape or form!! I was surprised at the lack of bad reviews on here, and NONE were even for the show, just the disks or packaging, except that it doesn't have the theme song tho no one knows why!! I LOVE Black Adder, Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers, The Young Ones, and MANY more such shows where u have to appreciate British humour in order to enjoy them, but AbFab didn't make me laugh once, even the ep with Whoopi when they were looking for Serge in NY which I thot would have been one of the funnier ones, but I was wrong, SO VERY WRONG!!!!!!! Only reason I think there aren't any actual bad reviews is that someone has conveniently deleted them or those who watched it had ALREADY wasted time they couldn't get back and didn't want to waste anymore by writing a review!! I hope that my review will actually save at least one person from subjecting themselves to this extremely poor excuse of a tv show!!!!!!!",1492905600,,1207,4.275109170305677

5911158,1,B00EF4U7JQ,"**UPDATE**
Edited to reduce rating from three stars to one. The replacement set arrived today and disc 6 is still missing.

The show will always be great, but this set seems hastily thrown together. I ordered my set directly from Amazon (i.e. not from a third party). The set arrived factory-sealed, but when I opened it, disc 6 was missing (Amazon quickly shipped a replacement). The ""clutch"" also looks cheap, as it is just laminated cardboard, and the cover has bubbled in several places.

The subtitles are useless for anything more than providing a brief summary of entire scenes of dialogue. I'm not hard of hearing, but I do like to use subtitles when I watch British or Aussie movies or shows so I can keep the volume low while my daughter sleeps, and so I can catch any rapid-fire, heavily accented lines. I may as well not use these subtitles, because they leave out entire lines and summarize the rest. That may work for a drama program, but not so much in a comedy.

In sum, I'm happy to have the whole series in one set, but I'm not so impressed with the quality.",1482019200,,1076,4.507692307692308
5911159,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"For true Ab Fab fans, this set includes all televised content, plus plenty of supplemental materials.  One word of warning, Amazon will inevitably recommend purchasing this set along with one of the single DVDs containing the various AbFab specials.  Don't be fooled, with the exception of the 2016 film; this set contains EVERYTHING... no need to purchase anything else.",1481241600,6,371,5.271186440677966

5911162,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"I am American and I discovered this wonderful show only a year ago when I saw on yahoo news that Jennifer Saunders was make the film. I remembered Jennifer Saunders did the voice of Fairy Godmother from Shrek 2 so I was curious about this show. In the article's comments there was nothing but praise for the show. I saw a few clips on the internet and fell in love with Jennifer's comedy and Patsy's style. Without even seeing a full episode yet I purchased this set (which was about $100 when I bought it) and I was not disappointed!

The dvd set comes in an adorable/compact box that resembles a clutch bag. It's not only a cute stylish idea for a box but it's made really well, protecting the dvd case excellently. It's not like those other collection boxes made out of cardboard and start to wear out over time. And this set really does have EVERY episode including bonus material. The only issue I have is a few episodes have been edited in a way that some scenes are missing. Like in the Birthday episode, the karaoke scene is rather butchered because they cut out Patsy doing the mick jagger dance and removed a lot of the singing parts. Then on the episode wear Saffy gives birth, they remove the part where Bo is dreaming about singing in Chicago, which I thought was a funny scene. They also removed the ""Wheel's on Fire"" song from all the episodes because of copyright issues or something. These are just minor annoyances for me. Other than that, everything is in tact and crystal clear. This is a perfect set for a true Absolutely Fabulous fan!",1480809600,8,1556,4.47887323943662

Jennifer Saunders is still not a household name but she is far funnier than Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett and a lot of other people.  Her writing is brilliant.  The only downside to this set is that some idiot added a laugh track, which is horrible enough in itself, but it is loud and actually drowns out some of the dialogue.  The other thing is that the set is packaged very badly and you can damage the DVD's if you're not careful.",1470182400,,495,4.3478260869565215

5911185,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"I recently purchased a 65"" 4k TV and attempted to watch the ""Morocco"" episode from my old ab fab dvd. I was disappointed in the quality of the image stretched onto my screen, I  changed the size, played with the colors and brightness but was still not impressed with the quality. Since this collection states that series 1 - 3 has had ""some work"" done, I decided to give it a go and re-complete my collection. Although series 1 - 3, in this remastered dvd collection, isn't as crisp as series 4 and onward it's pretty darn impressive of the restoration in image quality. Reading other amazon reviews, saying that the restored series looks funny, I didn't notice that at all but have only watched on the large high res TV, If it were compressed down maybe that would become an issue? I also began to watch some of the new extras and found them very entertaining, a great bonus for any die hard fan.

And it's nice to have the entire show in a more compact design. But by the time it arrived at my door, several discs had fallen out of place. The ones that did fall had gotten scratches from this. I put in for an exchange and Amazon sent me another copy. This time it had bubble wrap, which helped a little. However, even on the second one a few discs became dislodged. But since they weren't in too bad shape, and it was pretty obvious that the discs were still gonna come out no matter what, I just kept it. They still play fine. But please, BBC, go for a more sturdy case for your DVDs.",1437091200,,931,4.149171270718232

5911212,3,B00EF4U7JQ,"I've been a fan of Absolutely Fabulous for a very long time. I was delighted to get this and I loved the packaging and the remastering that was done for the first 3 series. However the subtitles are awful. Long lines of dialogue have been simplified and shortened instead of being displayed exactly as they were spoken, several lines are missed and whenever characters are having conversations, their lines are combined into one, making it look like one character is talking to themselves. Also not everything was presented in chronological order. Instead of putting the The Last Shout in between the 3rd and 4 series and Gay after the 4 series, they are put onto a separate disc and when you press play all Gay which was from 2002 plays BEFORE The Last Shout which was from 1996. The same thing is done with the sketches, the 2005 Comic Relief Sketch is placed as a bonus feature on another DVD instead of being put after White Box and the Sports Relief Sketch from 2012 which should be between Job and Olympics is also pushed aside to another disc as a bonus feature, so the switching back and forth between discs instead of going through them in order is frustrating. But other than that, I actually enjoyed the box set. Although the later series weren't as good as the first 3.",1435708800,3,1281,4.573913043478261

5911214,3,B00EF4U7JQ,"The video image is jumpy in places, ""Wheels on Fire"" song missing, some episodes edited (as compared to my old VHS tape set)--apparently this is NOT absolutely everything. Makes me wonder what was cut out of the newer episodes (which I had not seen otherwise). The disc case  is a horror (forces one to scratch the dvd's when removing them, and then cannot remove them in proper order).  Glad I got this on sale--would be really mad if I paid full price.

Edina should not be very happy with this quality.  Eddie--sweety, darling--perhaps you can add some comments of your own?",1434672000,6,577,4.683168316831683

5911236,1,B00EF4U7JQ,"I did not like the remastering at all. The episodes looked good, but it's completely different from what I am used to seeing. That bright, live tv feel. I felt like I was watching a movie version where they re-made the entire series word for word, but it didn't seem as funny. I don't know how to explain it. It was the same, but totally different. No Wheels on Fire theme song. The theme song is as iconic as the characters and the show is not the same without it. I also did not like the dvd packaging. I returned it and ordered the seasons individually. I am much happier watching the show with the theme song and no remastering. That's how I remember it, that's how I want to watch it. I absolutely love the show. I've been watching since high school, so like 15 years. I know the show well and did not like the remastering to make it look different, even if it does look better. That's just my opinion and do think the set is great if you can get over the remastering and no theme song....I couldn't.",1418947200,47,1005,4.239583333333333

5911251,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"The American completist will still be frustrated by a few things:  still no ""The Story of Absolutely Fabulous"" from Jan 2004 with its great cast interviews, still no ""Chicago"" scene in ""Birthin"", and still no opening theme music, as the song rights are too expensive (and not worth it?) for this side of the pond (or something like that), which also results in some awkward editing/minor loss in the karaoke scene of ""Birthday"", the final cemetery shot of ""Death"", and the fashion show in ""Gay"".  BUT...I was pleasantly surprised to see Madonna lyrics put back into ""Death"" and ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"" put back into ""The Last Shout"".  The crisper resolution (and helpful subtitles) of the made-over Series 1-3 and ""The Last Shout"" is reason enough to invest in this collection.

There are several times when the disc will ""freeze"" and then it will restart.  Sometimes when it freezes, it WILL NOT restart, and I  have to stop and then fast forward to a point beyond the place where it stopped playing.  I know it's the disc and not my DVD player, because the freeze points are the same each time, if it was my DVD player, the freeze points would be random.
Very frustrating because the show is so fast paced, even a few seconds or even a minute of it freezing detracts from the enjoyment of watching.",1398902400,7,641,4.352941176470588

5911262,5,B00EF4U7JQ,"This Complete set of AB Fab programs and specials runs 1235 minutes! For those of you without a calculator, I clue you in that that comes to 21 hours of zany fun! Since Im trying to get through the holiday season and get other reviews posted, I obviously have not watched  the full set. A few other reviews have provided some info  which Ill comment on  and then add some more info.

Though there are 10 discs they are housed in a package just a bit thicker than ONE standard VHS tape.  Thank goodness. Though the producers created a clever red purse design, it is still stores easily.

A few reviews mention the English subtitles. Since I have not seen the prior ABFAB collections, I can tell if they were on earlier sets but the New bonus features  per the press release include FRENCH language subtitles  so the English ones may have been there before. Other NEW Bonus Features include:
A History of AB/FAB"" featurette
An interview with actress June Whitfield
The 2012 Ab Fab Comic Relief Special
Newly recorded intros by Jon Plowman for the 20th Anniversary Specials and three of the sketches
Video of Jennifer and Joanna carrying the Olympic Torch

If you love the show, and don't have the prior collections, this is a handy way to have them all. Honestly, if you own them, youll have to decide whether to upgrade and pass you older set on to make an new Ab Fab fan.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
