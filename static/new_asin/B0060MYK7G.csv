4914130,4,B0060MYK7G,See my review of the First season. I am not willing to repeat what I said  in my review of the First season.,1354147200,,108,3.6956521739130435
4914131,5,B0060MYK7G,"Firstly, know that I have always been fascinated by all things renassaince - to include the art of the period and its artists, Machiavelli and the Borgias whom I have never found to be any worse  than their contemporaries. The French come off no worse than they were
historically.  Much of the senario is not too accurate historically but,
what the hell, it's smashing theatre but Juan Borgia comes across as the
lout he was and all the females are charming. Caesere and his sister are
to well played for me to quibble and Rodrigo is as dangerous as he was
in life.
The production values are first-rate and the characters represent the mores of the time well = superb direction & writing. I've seen the 1st
season only but I expect the subsequent seasons to be as good.",1353715200,11,769,4.525179856115108
4914132,4,B0060MYK7G,"THE BORGIAS is back on screen and Season 2 is  a welcome return. As last season progressed the series became a bit fragmented, but those seeds of subplots are now coming to be fleshed out. The cast remains the same (except some of last season's actors have already been knocked off, like poor Paolo).  Neil Jordan still is the major influence and he is ably served by Jeremy Irons, (Rodrigo Borgia) the wonderful Franois Arnaud (Cesare Borgia), Holliday Grainger (Lucrezia Borgia), Lotte Verbeek (Giulia Farnese), David Oakes (Juan Borgia), Colm Feore (Giuliano Della Rovere), et al.  One major change that is very positive - the art of the opening credits are truly creative and historically informed and simply fine graphics.  Here is to another season with the cruelest family that ever lived!  Grady Harp, April 12",1334275200,100,818,4.985294117647059

4914382,4,B0060MYK7G,"Its a bit risky to get ones history from a television series but The Borgias is an interesting glimpse at the absolute corruption of the Roman Catholic church immediately prior to the Reformation. The Borgia clan is headed by Rodrigo, pope Alexander VI (Irons), whos ably assisted by his ruthless children, Cardinal Cesare (Arnaud), Lucrezia (Grainger), and Juan (Oakes).

In this season, Cesare ingeniously foils an attack on Rome by the French king. An attempt to avenge the treachery of the Sforza family backfires, leading to the eventual downfall of Juan. Rodrigo can no longer ignore the heretical opposition of influential friar Savonarola of Florence and plots his demise. Possible suitors for Lucrezia are considered for their political advantages, as Rodrigos arch-enemy, Cardinal Della Rovere, schemes to end the popes life with poison.

As I mentioned in my review of the first season, fidgety, irresolute Jeremy Irons is a fish out of water as the ruthless Rodrigo. Likewise, Arnaud cant pull off the barracudian intensity of the Machiavellian Prince, Cesare. Holliday Grainger is also a bit too sweet as the venomous black widow, Lucrezia, but were starting to see her fangs come out. The 15th-century sets and costumes are remarkable.

Murder, torture, treachery, fornication, heresy, the ruthless acquisition of wealth and political power; these were just a few of the earmarks of the Borgias reign. The history of the papacy includes many such dark and embarrassing chapters. See The Dark Side of the Papacy by Peter de Rosa. Praise the Lord for raising up the men and women of the Reformation  who sought to return the church to simple faith in Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. Many died for their stand for the Gospel while many of todays doctrine-lite evangelicals eagerly join arms with Rome in the interest of Christian unity.",1456790400,,1862,5.115131578947368

4914490,5,B0060MYK7G,"Season 2 of the Borgias continues the great entertainment of Season 1. The politically astute Pope Alexander VI, played by Jeremy Irons, continues to hold off the invasions of the French to the North of the Papal States while trying to control the great families of the Papal States that want nothing more than to be free of the dominance of the Papacy over their ancestral lands. Rodrigo Borgia must continually wage diplomacy and warfare just to maintain the status quo.  He relies on his Cardinal son Caesar for the diplomacy and he relies on his second son Juan to lead the Papal troops. The tension between the brothers adds to the stress upon the Pope who wishes for more family unity in the face of so many external threats. Jeremy Irons plays the role of Alexander VI very well, revealing all the brilliant political strategy in which Alexander engaged to maintain his Papacy.  In Season 2 the Pope is less lusty but remains astute at judging statecraft and continues to place family members into marriages advantageous to his family.

The series does take liberties with the actual facts but this is historic drama and the general picture is still revealed here.  The Italian peninsula was divided between multiple kingdoms and powerful families, unfortunately none of which could defeat the French. The series illustrates the rise of Caesar Borgia and in this interpretation he is a man who is never fully appreciated by his father who focuses great attention on his second son Juan and his daughter who moves from a mere childish adolescent in Season 1 to a more self-assured young woman in Season 2.

The series is about power politics made spicy by sexual affairs. The Papal States were in conflict and rarely in harmony with Florence and Tuscany, ruled by the Medici. However in Season 2 we see the rise of Machiavelli, a subject of Florence and part of the Medici court, but a brilliant man who is drawn toward Caesar Borgia and his political and military skills. Season 2 also explored the tension between the Papal States and the area of Italy called the Marshes, ruled by the Sforza family.  Pope Alexander VIs chancellor is a Sforza, his daughter Lucrezia was once married to a Sforza, and the female cousin in the family, Catherine Sforza is a force of nature in her own right.  The acting by the actress who plays Catherine is probably the best acting in the whole series; she is absolutely fantastic and brings this character to life.

Alexander VI continues to develop enemies and the determined Cardinal Della Robbia remains his primary enemy within the Roman Catholic clergy.  Will Durants book on the Renaissance points out the evidence that Alexander VI was also a religious man and Season 2 honors this aspect of Alexanders papacy. This series depicts Alexander as a Christian leader despite his considerable skills at consolidating power. Jeremy Irons is excellent at showing the many sides of Alexander.

Cardinal Della Rovere, later Pope Julius II, is played by Colm Feore to perfection. He is the outsider trying to undermine the Papacy of Alexander whom he totally despises. However in Season 2 we see the Cardinal, initially a highly devout man, develop the crafty ways of Pope Alexander, the man he hates. His careful plots make up much of Season 2.

Alexanders eldest illegitimate son, Cesare Borgia, had military aspirations but is always asked to be the diplomat by his father who asks him to assume the duties of a Prince of the Church while having to endure his younger brother Juan with whom e Pope Alexander has placed the responsibility of military protection of the Vatican. Francois Arnaud plays the role well. Juan Borgia is played by David Oakes and much of Season 2 is the deterioration of Juan. Season 2 sees less of daughter Lucrezia Borgia, played by Holliday Grainger. Lucrezia Borgia was a complex and highly intelligent character and her character matures in Season 2.

The rise and fall of Savonarolla, the evangelical monk of Florence, is a major theme in Season 2 and makes for exceptional drama.  I strongly recommend Season 2. The characters of Savonarolla and Catherine Sforza are wonderful additions to the mix. The films may at times play with historic fact, but for the most part it maintains the historic outline of events while richly entertaining.",1420848000,,4313,4.867667121418827

4914512,5,B0060MYK7G,"i really wondered what I was getting into when I purchased this set. My sister said she liked it but she had no further comment. I wanted to know things: Was it historically accurate? Did it convey a sense of the Renaissance? Was the dialogue banal or inspired? Did it - Well, you get the picture. Most of my doubts were allayed when I saw that fine Irish artist Neil Jordan was the producer, the writer and frequent director of episodes. I have only the highest accolades for his achievement in his many roles in bringing the series to life. It is absolutely wonderful see Jeremy Irons in a major role. Let me just say this - the waters part for him in every scene he is in, whether it is played for drama or humor. He is an actor of intelligence, imagination and depth - Enough said! The wonderful surprise was the excellence of the ensemble. The Borgia children all excellent, and Sean Harris who plays Cesare's faithful servant and killer on demand is splendid. However, do not think you are getting a History Lesson. The script plays fast and loose with historical events.
It may convey the spirit of the times, but not the actual events. Why? I don't know, and I was enjoying myself too much to care. If you want to see a film which re-creates the Italian Renaissance with accuracy and depth watch Roberto Rossellini's THE AGE OF THE MEDICI from 1972. It is brilliant and memorable.

This excellent historic drama focuses on the Spanish family that held the papacy and the Papal States in its grasp at the end of the 15th/start of the 16th centuries. While the music, sets and costumes are all excellent, this series is held together by a wonderful group of actors including the masterful Jeremy Irons as Pope Alexander VI, Franois Arnaud as Cesare Borgia and Holliday Grainger as Lucrezia Borgia. Two of the stars from the first season-- Lott Verbeek as Giulia Farnese and Colm Feore as Cardinal Della Rovere--get less screen time and that is a problem as both of them are excellent. The writing is fast-paced and generally comes together along with fine drama, tense moments and an epic feel. The special features continue to underwhelm but the second season has more than the first. Still, this is a great show. Highly recommended.",1402876800,,953,4.817073170731708

4914621,5,B0060MYK7G,enjoyed rewatching this show. Jeremy Irons is a wonderful central character playing the mult-fascited Pope as an urbane rascal with a big heart and a soft spot for babies and beautiful women.  Chesare and Lucritia are also fascinating and the story is like an ear-worm--it gets inside you and just won't quit.  Lots of fun and the clothes and sets are spectacular.

The series does take its liberties from the historical point of view, but it will probably be the only visual of high quality we will see in a long time.  What really is disturbing, is that they cancelled the series after the third season.  If you are not going to see the project through properly to the end, it should never have been started.

additional facts about the actual history.  Great casting,

4914641,5,B0060MYK7G,"Having watched every episode of HBO Network Rome Series, which wife and I thoroughly enjoyed, I disagree with reviewer who stated it was any better than The Borgias.

We picked up quite a bit of local history to include French Army's pillaging of Luca, Palazzo Farnese, Savonarola's followers huge Bonfires of the Vanities, Piazza Navona and Vatican Gardens.  It is no less historically accurate than HBO's Rome Series.

Warning:
Show is highly addictive.

Francois Arnaud takes up the slake, and there is plenty of that, as Rodrigo's son, a Cardinal.

This Pope was truly one of the worst; his family and their values were indicative of power!  This historical-fiction movie has great acting by all those involved, has more plot twists than Lombard Street in San Francisco, includes romanticism, war, sneaky liaisons, and just when you think the plot settles down ... it takes off again on another nasty turn.  Great stuff and it pretty much follows the history of the times.",1375920000,,524,4.725274725274725
4914881,2,B0060MYK7G,"It seems I'm in minority here, but I think Season 2 started the downfall of the series. Apparently, the writers decided that even the scant amount of history on display in Season 1 was much too binding for them. As it often happens, their dull, uninspired and predictable storylines are no match for the real historical events. The actors are doing what they can but don't expect any intriguing character development here.

Cesare, who showed some ambition and cynical attitudes in Season 1, is starting to become a knight in the shining armor who only acts out of vengeance or to protect his family. And he is not particularly adept at that. Aut Caesar, aut nihil? Forget about that. Rodrigo continues to be a vengeful idiot (points for having a busier sex life than his eldest son). Juan, who was a wastrel, but an easy-going one, inexplicably become so mean and overbearing that everyone wants to kill him. Lucrezia... she just wants to be loved. And to give cooking lessons to the cardinals. Della Rovere, tired of the assassination attempts on his life (who can blame him), decides to stick it to the Borgia and become a master assassin himself (I guess he could be a good character on Assassin Creed). Sancha and Joffre... they're not there anymore. And I mean, at all. They will never show up again. Not even when Lucrezia marries Sancha's brother. (Ok, I admit Joffre is not the most interesting Borgia man, but they could have at least mentioned him a couple of times). You can see how well they're paying attention to detail here.

What was good, aside from the production values? Cesare + Lucrezia is still going strong and the only reason I kept watching the series through Season 3. I also liked seeing Francesco Gonzaga who, surprisingly, resembled his portrait quite a bit. I'm still at a loss to explain why they gave him a fake wife instead of Isabella d'Este (sister of Alfonso d'Este, Lucrezia's third husband) who had a famous rivalry with Lucrezia. And Savanarola scenes were decent, although, again, they changed details for no apparent reason.

In the end, the second season of The Borgias is just a pseudo-historical soap opera with vaguely medieval costumes and sets and with one-dimensional characters who bear little resemblance with their famous Renaissance prototypes.

Once again, I recommend checking the other Borgia show (run by Tom Fontana with the European channels) if you want to see at least something that resembles history.",1375833600,2,2463,4.871121718377088

4914907,5,B0060MYK7G,"The Borgias is a Showtime drama set in late 15th century Rome. The specific focus of the show concerns Rodrigo Borgias' ascent to the papacy and his efforts to stay in power through the turbulent events of the period.

The show commences in 1492, the year that Alexander VI became Pope. Of course, most people will also recognize that year as the same in which Columbus discovered the New World. This date therefore provides an easy connection to the historical timeline that most people can easily relate to. Once Borgia becomes Alexander VI, the saga begins, and the show describes the machinations made to maintain Alexander six on the throne. This is a difficult and sometimes brutal history, and those that are familiar with this history will not be surprised at the events that unfold in the subsequent episodes. The show is largely historically accurate, both in the broad brush strokes and also in some of the minute details.

There is little reason to repeat the expensive information that has already been written about this series including the specific detail covered in each episode. We can easily echo, however, the extremely high-quality production values of the show. We can also echo the view that the acting in the show is extremely well done. As companies like Showtime and HBO and Netflix continue to make extremely lush, well-developed dramas, we see that this move has now become the pinnacle of television production at this current time, one that is now rivaling, and sometimes, surpassing full screen movies. This is also the case with The Borgias. This is a show that is supremely well done, and it shows in every scene. The art sets, the costumes, the colors, the settings, and on and on are superbly well done. In fact, it seems we are watching here something of a quality level that would not even normally be seen in a full screen movie.

The acting, of course, is of greatest importance, and we see with an outstanding cast including Jeremy Irons that the cast are up to every bit of the task and make the story come alive on the screen. It has been rumored that the show cost Showtime approximately $2.5 million per episode to make. That runs out to roughly $25 million per season. When you watch the show on a high definition television BluRay player, you can see where some of that money was spent. The show is lush, lavish, and it makes one marvel at how such shows are being made  today. Filming was carried out primarily in Hungary, and there is some use of CGI and certain scenes, but these are barely noticeable, and in fact sometimes are not noticeable at all. The architectural backgrounds to many of the scenes are simply superb, even when they are CGI.

The Borgias had a loyal following for the first three seasons on Showtime. However, in a trend that we have heard all too often before, ratings were not as high as Showtime had hoped, particularly in Season Three. The show was originally slated for a four season run, but because the ratings were slightly disappointing in Season Three, Showtime decided to cancel the series at the end of the third season. This means that the planned Season Four of The Borgias does not exist, and likely will never be made. (This is not unlike the situation that occurred with the critically acclaimed show Boss, starring Kelsey Grammer, which was canceled after two seasons because of low ratings, but was considered to be one of the best drama shows put on television in recent memory.) But in spite of the disappointment that no Season Four is to be made, this is no reason not to watch The Borgias and to follow those first three seasons as they are made. (The same is true of Boss, as well; watching its first two seasons can be an amazing experience, in spite of the truncated ending of the show.)

The Borgias is an excellent historical drama that will help you to learn much about the period, and the papacy of Alexander the sixth. It has some difficult scenes, but the show has seemingly done a reasonable job of attempting to portray the story without making it so consistently brutal that one would not wish to watch it. Watching the show in Blu-ray format with a high-definition television can provide some of the sharpest clearest and most colorful presentations that we've ever seen.

This is an easy five-star recommendation for anyone enjoying historical dramas, or for those interested in the period.",1374710400,2,4399,4.727509778357236
4914908,5,B0060MYK7G,"Just as in the first season, the drama continues with historical results!  Of course I was not there, but can believe that the time of the ""married"" Pope's life has been close to as real as it happened.",1374624000,,202,4.315789473684211

4914973,5,B0060MYK7G,"The second season of The Borgias definitely ups the intrigue, violence, and sex. Rodrigo has now secured his position as Pope, but he is by no means safe as Cardinal Della Roverre continues to work against him from the shadows. Lucrezia continues to develop and mature into a young woman and mother and comes to see her family and the world for what it is. The jealousy and tension between Cesare and Juan increases as Cesare continues to be forced into a cardinal's robes by his father while Juan is made Duke of Gandia and head of the papal armies.

This season is a very strong follow up to the first and in many ways surpasses it. I loved watching Guilia and Lucrezia take on more active roles and the relationship between Juan and Cesare grow darker. There are several turning points that will clearly affect the characters greatly in the future and ultimately change who they are.

As with the first season, I can't recommend this show enough to anyone who loves period shows or just intrigue and drama. The Borgias is a smart, well-acted show.",1372550400,,1050,4.609625668449198

Unbelievable that a pope in the Catholic Church could act in such a way, but no one ever said that all popes were holy and good.  A great series.",1372377600,,396,4.3561643835616435

4915079,5,B0060MYK7G,"The proper comparison for ""The Borgias"" is similar 10 - 12 episode costume dramas, historical or fantastical, such as ""Rome"" and ""Game of Thrones"", not what we find in history books. There are too many deviations from history to make that comparison worthwhile, with one big exception. The historical interpretation of the Borgias as vile and immoral may be inaccurate. This dramatization seems to err on the side of making the Borgia clan no more vile and immoral than their antagonists.

One thing which makes this production (both seasons) more exciting and engaging than ""Game of Thrones"" is that there is so much more light, color, and action, in spite of the fact that both lived in a world where the only light was sun and candle. Both involve battles and large armies; except that like ""Rome"", ""Game of Thrones"" keeps all that action off screen, and when it does appear at the end of season 2, it is at night, and mostly with close-ups of small groups of combatants, or with ships, done with models.

As I mentioned above, the Borgias are presented as no worse than their enemies. Some opponents, like the semi-factual Niccolo Machiavelli become their friends and some appear more virtuous, such as Caterina Sforza. Juan Borgia is both dissolute, incompetent, and cowardly, with no honor to speak of. Rodrigo, Pope Alexander, is seriously flawed, but he is true to his faith and its humility, which works to his purposes, as he see's God's guidance being effective in charming his most serious opponents such as the King of France, who is one of the most interesting characters in bot seasons. Juan is so corrupt he disgusts his own ally, a Conquistador captain from Spain. Cesare and Lucrezia fall between the two. Both are willful, but smart and ruthless. Cesare leaves a lot of the dirty work to his bodyguard, Michelotto Corella, but Cesare plans all the dirty deeds, and participates in many of them, with a mask.

In my review of the first season, I said it was hard to keep everyone straight, especially all the cast members who are cardinals (except for the distinct face of Derek Jacobi, who does not survive the first season.) It usually takes no more than a second viewing to sort everything out.

At the risk of revealing a spoiler, I will say one of the most interesting aspects of the series is the relations between the Borgia family members, which are often no less intense than the relations with lovers and enemies.

I suspect the production benefitted from being able to use buildings from the Renaissance in Rome, Milan, Naples, and Florence which are still around. When I walked the streets of Florence in 1964, it seemed as if I were walking them in 1500. Very little had changed.",1371081600,2,2710,4.757446808510639

The acting is brilliant.  The story?  Well, it has intrigue, greed, lust, sex--all the elements of great storytelling.  The characters?  The Borgias were absolutely ""out there.""  Not much else to say.  The thing that impresses me most is that this is based, albeit Hollywood-style--on real people and events, unlike that other blockbuster on the other channel.  I like both, but seeing actual historical characters and events tips the scale for me.  Jeremy Irons has never been better, and that's saying a lot since I've seen nearly everything he's acted in.  Watch the whole series, if only for him.  If you want to check for accuracy, get out a history book.  Here's the thing:  History is written by the winners, so can we ever know for sure?  What we can know is that this is a wonderful series with characters you'll love.  And hate.
Warning:  There's some full frontal nudity and lots of violence.  Well, I don't think even the most sanitized history books ever portrayed them as saints.  And some Catholics may be offended at this raw look at one of their popes.  I'm Catholic, and I've always known that popes have human frailties; some, like this one, had a lot of human frailties.  Sorry, but it's true.
Bonus:  The actor playing Cesare is not only a fine actor but gorgeous as well.

I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, so this was up my alley from the get go, then you ad Jeremy Irons into the mix and I'm engrossed. This is my type of soap opera! As always Mr. Irons is stellar ( and still soooo very good looking) and I'm now becoming a huge fan of Mr. Aurnad (sp?), who plays Cesare Borgia. I feel he plays the part well--I can see the rage inside of him as he struggles with his ambition, his father's ambition, which most of the time are in conflict, and his feelings for his sister.  The series visits situations based on history (with license) surrounding the Borgia Family. I give it five as an entertaining piece of historical fiction, there's violence, intrigue and forbidden romances, back stabbing upon back stabbing which, IMO, have all been portrayed with some class by all the actors.  Hope everyone who like historical fiction enjoys this as well and don't rely on it for historical fact, just enjoy!",1368144000,,997,4.497237569060774

4915286,5,B0060MYK7G,"The Borgias is truly one of the greatest television shows I have watched and the second season cemented that.

Stylistically, it is absolutely breathtaking in every manner.  The details paid to the costumes and sets are exquisitely rendered.  It feels as if every frame has been hand painted.  From the very first episode of the very first season, the audience is treated to a cinematic experience.

Jeremy Irons, of course, brings the drama with his bombastic portrayal of the calculating, power-driven Rodrigo Borgia.  Francois Arnaud steals the show with his often sinister manipulations as the strategic Cesare Borgia.  Cesare is the trusted son who finds himself confined by the walls of the Vatican in his unwanted cardinal robes.  He is to be his father's eyes and ears at every turn, but Cesare may not be the best individual to handle interpersonal relationships (a violent streak, that one... not to mention his companion, Michelotto, a deadly assassin). The envy he holds for his bumbling older brother Juan's (the phenomenal David Oakes) position as leader of the papal army serves as a constant source of conflict.  It is a position Cesare will do anything to gain.  Juan is Rodrigo's favored child and is fully aware of this.  He is spoiled and pampered, this season finds him at a serious loss when he reaches one excruciating low after another and struggles to find his feet.  Holliday Grainger brings innocence, sensuality, and charm to the infamous figure of Lucrezia Borgia.  Lucrezia must constantly adapt to her familial position as a mere bargaining tool in her father's political games.  She escapes one abusive marriage to an affluent husband during the first season through an annulment only to find her newly found freedom threatened by a second political marriage.

The Borgias is a show that focuses on an ambitious family and their struggle to essentially rule Italy.  It is thrilling and thought-provoking.  Some of the pacing and story threads can feel a bit rushed or even prodding at times, but the singular effect at the end of the season is that of completion.  I am currently watching the third season as it airs and it appears to be as equally magnificent at the second.",1367193600,,2207,4.951086956521739

Even though the horror of the excess they indulged in,
(in comparison to everyone else) is truly awful, you can't help but fall in love
 with the characters and sympathize with their tragedies and shortcomings.
It makes you think about your own failures and realize if you aren't one of
the rich and powerful then you don't have near as far to fall.

The acting is amazing and before long you are rooting for the bad guys.  Personally
I think the mark of a truly great actor is their ability to make you love them

4915436,4,B0060MYK7G,"I don't know the target audience for this show-- I suppose it's for people who like the Tudors, and may be interested in the upcoming DaVinci's Demons. As someone interested in the Catholic church, and a fan of Mario Puzo who supposedly found his inspiration in this family, I found it intriguing. The series is mostly quiet, with a lot of plotting in hushed voices, then someone gets a throat slashed or gets poisoned. Battles are either thwarted or mostly fought off screen, though individual murders happen all the time. I think there is enough sex, story and eye candy for most people.

A lot of people complain how the show deviates from history, just like the vocal Game of Thrones fanbase is locked in an eternal struggle between book fans and TV show fans. If you have doubts, I think Showtime has the full season 2 premiere free to watch on their website. The episode can stand enough on its own that you can understand what is going on and get a feel for whether or not you will like it.

SPOILER ALERT

There are a few stand out parts for me. We finally find out more about Micheletto the assassin when he travels to his home town with Cesare. The scenes with his mother are hilarious, and we find out why he doesn't ever seem to be preoccupied with a girl or brothels.

Lucrezia, the Pope's current mistress, and the mother of his children set out to make sure church funds go to the poor where they are supposed to go. It seems that all the women the Pope sleeps with ultimately become agents of his, doing favors for him like this. One is placed in charge of finding cannons when the French army approaches again. Lucrezia is in charge of the Vatican when the Pope has to go on a journey.

The tension between Juan and his two siblings, Cesare and Lucrezia, builds to a fever pitch upon his return to Rome after a hiatus in Spain. Juan kind of gets what he deserves, and Cesare more put him out of his misery than murders him. The scene where the Pope/Rodrigo Borgia buries his son Juan intermixed with scenes of Lucrezia's wedding was very well done. I hope the music score for the second season will be released, because it helped make that moment all the more poignant.

Cesare has longed to stop being a cardinal and to be a soldier in the Papal army since the beginning, and this season he dons a mask to avenge his dead lover and to steal gold in an effort to get the Pope to release him. I don't know if his costume was supposed to be true to the period or not, or if they intended it, but the scenes where he puts on his mask and runs about in his armor are hysterical. By day, he's a cardinal, by night, he's Batman! With Micheletto as Robin, and a band of outlaws and no-goods as their Merry Men, the Batman tortures, kills and steals to set right what once was wrong! The mask looks so bad that I couldn't stop laughing.

There are really no extras on the blu ray to speak of. The special features that do exist all seem to be on BD live, and you have to have an internet connection for that. I can't tell you how incredibly annoying that is. There are 2 episodes of Californication and 2 episodes of House of Lies that you can access through the BD live, but neither of these shows interest me in the least. They would have been better off including a couple of key episodes of the Tudors if they needed filler-- at least it would be a related genre. I really resent paying for the discs and then having to go online to ask permission to watch the extras. There aren't even any episodes with commentary as far as I can tell.

This show could benefit greatly form a slightly larger budget, and perhaps one or two more episodes per season to keep a better pace. If you're preoccupied by the problems in the modern Catholic church, if you're easily offended by most things that come out of an HBO or Showtime series, if you're an historical nitpicker, or if you're expecting the show to wow you on all levels, don't watch it. It is a solid 4 stars, not even coming close to 5, but it is entertaining and for me a worthwhile watch.",1364428800,4,4053,4.323684210526316
4915437,5,B0060MYK7G,This show really takes off in it's second season. the borgias were a interesting group and this show does them justice.

For all of the popes phlllandering the papacy could have done a lot worse than him at the time.  This season  is even better than the first one and frankly as much as I like the other show 'borgia' this one is much better and less about rumours and more about the a solid story of the middle ages. I watched this on intant video and therefore had it streamed to me. SO I can't comment on the dvd or blu ray. In had this show looks great streaming though. The actors really have fallen into character too. Jeremy Irons has become the controversial pope so well that it's hard to imagine anyone else doing it better. I do like the Borgia cast though. Although in season one they killed off Juan and borgias is smart enough not to go that route. (this show also does not have cesare kill him off etc).  There isn't a dull moment watching this cast eat up the scenery as the borgias. And he Borgias were a great subject to pick for a series to be sure.,1364169600,,1175,4.1902654867256635

4915440,2,B0060MYK7G,"I was very disappointed. This is nothing like the Tudors- this is just another bad soap opera, albeit set in Renaissance Italy.  What a waste of history and all that delicious wickedness.  Everything feels phony and staged.  There is no cohesion between scenes or story lines.  Sure, they wear the costumes, but I don't buy Irons as Pope for a second.  The two Borgia sons, nobles by birth, act more like the rednecks from Deliverance than royalty.  They are supposed to be master schemers, but I don't think either could wipe himself clean.  And their hair is feathered and blown out so big that the men look like singers from an 80's metal hair band! (Twisted Sister does Rome.) I did not know they had blow dryers in the Middle Ages.  Hilarious!  Some of the actors speak normally, some with bad Italian accents and the star Jeremy Irons speaks like his mouth is stuffed with a wad of cotton and he's trying not to spit it out.  It's very unnatural.  The only redeeming feature is that the women are stunning.",1362700800,3,1012,4.566666666666666

4915474,5,B0060MYK7G,"Note: I saw every episode of season 2 with XFinity On Demand.

After a thrilling first season, the historical drama THE BORGIAS continues to amaze and shock with their opulence and depravity. Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as Rodrigo Borgia, also known as Pope Alexander Sixtus, the patriarch of the infamous family. I've read that there are several historical inaccuracies, but as far as I can tell, this series is more accurate than The Tudors, Rome and especially the CGI-blood filled and inexplicably profanity-laced SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND (and the following seasons of that show). The costumes and sets are extraordinarily well-done. My only complaint in season II is the weird scenes between Micheletto, Cesare's condottieri, and another man...in a graveyard. The afore-mentioned part of both men was weird enough, but to set the scene in a cemetery...even weirder. There's no historical basis for that scene, that I'm aware of. That is my only complaint with season II.

RATED TV-MA for graphic violence, brief strong language (one use of the f-word) and copious amounts of sexuality/nudity.

Season III begins Sunday April 14, 2013, on Showtime with new episodes available the day after they air via XFinity On Demand and also available in HD.",1361145600,2,1275,5.179611650485437

It's definitely one of my favorite shows and is as good as any show I've ever seen in ALL aspects. I'm glad its extended for AT LEAST season 3 and perhaps beyond. I have not SEEN the European version called Borgia and the Tudors but I can PLAINLY say the US version The Borgias is an amazing show that demands to be watched. It's a tad boring in Season 1 but Season 2 is bigger and better in all aspects. The only gripe about the show is that only 9 episodes in season 1 and Season 2 only had 10 episodes they should have at least 13. I'm glad Juan is dead!!! yay!",1358812800,4,715,4.114285714285714
4915480,3,B0060MYK7G,"The Borgias, despite all the bloodshed, is a pretty film which is nice to watch but I feel the actors are going through their paces without much interest in what they're doing.  This made me wonder whether Irons and Jacobi (I guess he was in the first series) are out of pocket money and needed  pick-up jobs.  It isn't that their acting was bad (they are both too good to deliver truly bad acting) just lackluster.  Seemed a waste of their formidable talents",1358380800,3,459,4.493975903614458

For Seaon 2. Was Very Upset, to get a DVD release and No Bluray, while in Europe the Bluray has been there for 3-4 months already.
To Add to Frustration. Amazon UK/FR do not deliver in Qu&eacute;bec, and As French People Living in North America, we are also stuck with the NTSC format. In Short, This Crap blocking the Video Format is only impacting French peopleFrom Qu&eacute;bec. USA prefers English and Spanish while French movies distributed in France are Not Readeable because of this Zoning stupidity.
To Finish up.
Amazon.dot Com does not deliver Outside of USA.
What a Nightmare, especially where we are supposed to have Freetrade Agreement in Place for 20 years. Way to Go Amazon....!!!!
Amazon dot CA cost more, or does not have the same product available. Worst, the Suggested links driving you to amazon UK or else, you book the order and guess what? We only deliver to US Address. Fantastic...
I can order with E-Bay from Honkong, China, Europe, but Amazon US, Impossible!!!
Hope the Blu Ray The Borgia will be available within 6 month is Amazon.ca.

4915512,4,B0060MYK7G,"The Borgias' second season builds on the strengths of its first: plotting, acting and characterisation on the artistic side, costumes, sets and spectacle on the technical; this is a season in which everyone involved seems to have hit their stride, and whilst a production of this scope and ambition could always be better, consider me satisfied.

Here in Australia it's been out since late 2012, so I've watched every episode and some of the Special Features. With this sort of historical drama I'd happily watch a ten hour documentary of the times. It certainly wouldn't hurt the producers credentials if, in these behind-the-scenes docos, they highlighted more those events in history faithfully dramatised by the show (naturally glossing over the inaccuracies).

Overall this show has turned out better than I thought it would and is at least one star better than its closest rival, The Tudors, thanks in large part to a more charismatic lead in Jeremy Irons and a wonderful supporting cast. It may help that I'm less familiar with Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia than I am with Henry VIII, but even so, The Borgias has a natural energy and emotion The Tudors often struggled to achieve. It looks like a show made by people who wanted to tell its story rather than cynically cash in on its forerunner's success.

Highly recommended.",1358294400,34,1329,4.95067264573991

The first season came out last December, so I was hopeful that that would be the case with the second season.  Not so, apparently.  My guess is that the release will likely follow the trend of most shows and occur in the month before or the month of the premiere of the new season (i.e. March or April in The Borgias's case).  Will keep my fingers crossed but I'd much rather Amazon put me out of my misery with a definitive date.

4915521,5,B0060MYK7G,"Presently the Catholic Church requires its clerics to be celibate.  But, that was not always the case.

The Borgias is a story about a conniving ruthless Spanish family in Rome.  The head of which, Rodrigo, bribes, cheats and murders his way to become the Pope of Rome.

There is nothing religious about this series.  All the Cardinals have families or mistresses.  The Pope has four children. He creates one Cardinal, one general of the Papal Armies and marries two off to cement alliances that will keep him in the papacy.

He is despicable to everyone but himself.

We are introduced to his daughter Lucrezia.  Lucrezia's family later came to epitomize the ruthless Machiavellian politics and sexual corruption alleged to be characteristic of the Renaissance Papacy.

But it's gotten to the point where you are simply doing it for the shock factor!  I get it, you want everyone who isn't gay to see that gay people can look or be anything!
