1172964,5,9089701117,"Sometimes websites don't give enough information about a product to know what you're getting.  For this reason, I've bought a lot of nature and relaxing dvds that are not what I wanted at all.  I want good quality streaming video, not photographic stills, and scenes should transition naturally.  This title delivers just that, and provides options for lots of scenes to choose from.

Having the natural sounds of a scene is more important to me than music, although I don;t mind music as long as I can choose the natural suounds. Since I use these DVDs for relaxation while reading, and sometimes to watch then listen to as I sleep, sound is everything.  Nature's Alarm Clock is a favorite title for this reason.  This title features nature sounds on all of its tracks, and includes a wide selection of scenes that I can play all together, or choose a favorite.  Serene Stream is my favorite scene on this title, and it delivers as promised.

I have more than a dozen titles from this producer - just look at the photos in this ad, and you'll see some of the mesmerizing scenes you'll get to experience.",1297555200,27,1104,4.625641025641026
1172965,5,9089701117,"I love this video.....It has a great picture on my Sharp Aquos tv.....The sceneries are beautiful and very relaxing. I love the looping feature so that way I can replay a certain scene if choose to do so. There are many different scenes on this video...that you don't get to enjoy in everyday real life.... some of us will never get that chance to enjoy such sceneries that are presented on this video during our lifetime either...If you love nature scenery, beaches, running creeks and such, but you live in the city or you don't get to enjoy this type of scenery often, get this video!!! You won't regret it.",1261526400,15,610,4.554545454545455
1172979,2,9089701117,"Didn't like this DVD.  While I appreciate the fact that it didn't introduce music and left the natural sound, I didn't find the most of the images relaxing.  There is nothing wrong with this DVD- it just didn't appeal to me.  What makes one person feel relaxed might not work for someone else.  Try a DVD from this series before purchasing a few of them as I did.",1425168000,,363,4.294117647058823

1172983,5,9089701117,"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!  Something for every human mood

What a wonderful DVD!!!!!!  This is the 4th dvd of Tony Helsloot's that I have purchased, and honestly it is becoming my favorite.  I simply love it and I can play it all day long, while I read or do other things.  I stop from time to time and look at what is on the TV screen and it always causes me to just smile.  I love this dvd as much as I do my fireplace dvd that I play in the winter months.  As a matter of fact I am planning on buying his fireplace one this fall.  I simply cannot tell you how wonderful this dvd is.  All I can say is do youself a favor and buy one, I will be extremely shocked if you do not just love it.  YES, it is extremely peaceful!!!!!!! relaxing!!!!!!  soothing!!!!!! etc.  Will bring JOY into your life.",1407715200,4,788,4.078431372549019
1172984,5,9089701117,I've bought about a half dozens of these types of videos so far from the same producer.  Each of them is fantastic.  I have them playing on a big screen on the wall in my accounting office behind me.  Sort of like a moving picture.  People seem to really love it.  Highly recommended for relaxation.  Beautiful photography.  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this video.,1402444800,7,383,4.712121212121212
1172985,5,9089701117,"This DVD has  3 sections that are almost completely different except that they're all sunrise videos. They're all beautiful - Dawn Chorus is an amazing video - the scenery, the birds, the mist, and so on, SO peaceful - then comes Refreshing Water - different styles, rapid water, slow water, waterfalls, it's all there with the wonderful and peaceful water sounds. The third video is sunrise over a beach, which is quite different from the others, but still as calming and relaxing. The photography is superb again. All in all, another great video from Tony Helsloot and his Ambient Collection.",1394582400,,594,4.94
1172986,5,9089701117,"When it's so cold and snowing and dark outside, watching this dvd is like a little vacation from that reality.",1389657600,,110,4.55
1172987,5,9089701117,"I just got this a couple weeks ago and play it all the time.  It is so great to wake up and exercise to in the morning!  The videos are amazing. These are real videos with moving water, blowing trees, live animals, etc. Truly like being there.  I LOVE that there are birds singing in lots of them.  The ones that ""flow"" from scene to scene do so gradually and you barely even notice a difference in the sound.  It is so nice that you can choose from lots of different scenes to play.  Highly recommend!",1376870400,,502,4.177083333333333
1172988,5,9089701117,"BEAUTY everywhere. NATURE at its very best. BEAUTIFULY filmed. There are three main films on this DVD. DAWN CHORUS is the 1st track. It is early morning, you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees. Mist surrounds, and dewy spider webs are in abundance. Peaceful, with lovely birdsongs. SUNRISE BEACH is the 2nd track. It shows you a rugged and rocky shoreline. You hear the sound of laping water, then the picture slowly changes to a different part of the shoreline. Everything looks real, as if you are there too. REFRESHING WATER is the next track. You see water everywhere. Fast running creeks. Water gushing over large boulders in a beautiful forest setting. Very Picturesque to see these scenes of Rapids, Creeks, large Rivers and Waterfalls. All this is going to Unwind you. Relax you, Astound you. But there is more yet to come. Now go to NATURAL MORNING WINDOWS and Click the button. And you will see 9 more beautiful scenes. The one that i like the most is TRANQUIL LAKE a truely magnifcent sight. I haven't been able to stop looking at it. If you get this DVD, you are going to be very pleased that you did.",1338595200,12,1131,4.5763546798029555

7901564,2,9089701117,"If you already have Nature's Windows, I would stay don't bother getting this one. About 5 of the 9 scenes are also on the Nature's Windows DVD. Disappointing.",1458604800,,158,4.678571428571429
7901565,1,9089701117,"GARBAGE---DO NOT BUY ANY  ""AMBIENT COLLECTION""  DVDs - - - One star means ""I hate it.""  I returned it immediately after the first viewing.  It is not calming.  It is annoying.  It is cheaply made junk.  If this DVD is an example of the trash this ""company"" makes, then do NOT buy any of these DVDs, some of which can be identified by the name ""The Ambient Collection"" or the name ""Tony Helsloot.""  Stay away from all of these DVDs.

The first section of this video consists mostly of STILL images.  The entire section is completely colorized with a repulsive grey-green-yellow screen.  The images are grey and difficult to see because of this sickening color.  I think I may have seen one moving image of ducks/geese floating around.  All images are repeated on a loop.  Endlessly.  Cheap junk.

The second section is ocean waves and the third is a stream--long shot, medium shot, long shot, medium shot, etc... Same images repeated endlessly.

There is some revealing information on the front/back cover of the DVD package for Nature's Alarm Clock.  That high definition picture of sunflowers photographed in late morning/ afternoon that you see on the front cover - -  this image appears no where in the three main sections of this DVD.  I don't know about the filler pieces, since I found this DVD so irritating I could not watch any more of it.  So much for peace and calm.

The back cover contains the following information:  ""Package Design and DVD Content copyrighted by Isis Visuals.""  To the right of that is a logo that says ""ISIS Asia Ltd."" and ""The Ambient Collection is a registered trademark of Isis Visuals.""  And also: ""Made in USA.""  I wonder what part of this DVD was made in the USA.  And I wonder what ISIS Asia is.

I returned this video DVD immediately and Amazon refunded the cost of $12.95.  However, Amazon did not return the 91 cents state tax I paid when I bought it.  Does Amazon keep all taxes buyers pay for items they return?  Hmmm.

WARNING - Do not buy anything connected with this ISIS Asia ""company"" or with the words ""The Ambient Collection"" or with the name ""Tony Helsloot.""",1449619200,,2111,4.621621621621622
7901566,2,9089701117,"I was disappointed as it is not I assumed by reading reading wonderful reviews? The photography is done at night with controlled lights and camera settings as I myself is an armature photographer.
The worst part is that quickly it goes into loop which is annoying and i hate it. Same scenes are repeated over and over, no natural feelings as what you see is same trees foliage and video, watching again and again.
Sorry I can't recommend it and i wish I could get my money back, I only watched it couple of times. BAD",1449014400,,517,4.395833333333333
7901567,3,9089701117,"It was ok,however,without music,the constant bird chirping for entire session  wasn't as relaxing.",1441238400,,98,6.538461538461538
7901568,5,9089701117,LOVE this producer! I have purchased several for my mom who lives in a total care facility! Great for background! BEAUTIFULLY filmed accompanied great music and/or nature sounds.,1439856000,,178,5.392857142857143
7901569,4,9089701117,"This DVD filmed in HD and in a widescreen format is all about Sunrises.  There are three different 20 minute segments as they say to begin your day.  The first one is entitled, Dawn Chorus.  It is the early morning sunrise with birds singing in the background.  There are also filmings of a spider web and ducks on a pond.  (spiders and their webs always fascinate me!) You can hear a town clock chiming in the distance.  All the pictures have a rich morning orange glow to them.  I have to say after 20 minutes of listening to the birds I was ready to move on to the next segment.  (Keep reading, it gets better and better in my opinion!)

The next segment is entitled Refreshing Water.  There are filmings of water in different settings -  streams, waterfalls, etc.  I have to admit I got very relaxed watching and listening to this segment.  One thing I would note  adjust your volume to how loud you want the water sound.  At times I had it loud for a powerful water experience and then I would turn it down to just a nice quiet in the background kind of experience.  I love to look at the way the light shines on the water and the rocks.  There is a little bit of birdsong with some of the water (not all of it) and I enjoyed it more in that content than in the continual setting of the first film.

The third segment is Sunrise Beaches.  I have to tell you, I am a beach lover!  I can watch the waves for hours so this segment went by much too quickly for me!  It was tranquil and just meditative!  I could imagine myself walking down the beach in the early morning hours, breathing deeply the clean, fresh air and enjoying the beautiful sky.  I thought it had the most beautiful scenes of the three segments.
After these three segments there is what is called Natural Morning Windows. These are each five minute segments.  Just a window into each special morning scene.  For instance, there is Misty Morning Lake, Forest Falls, Serene Stream or Tranquil Lake to name a few.  One that is different from all the rest and the picture featured on the DVD cover is Sunflower Breeze.  It just made me smile to see all those sunflowers moving in the Breeze!

Another great DVD from the Ambient Collection!  I received this DVD free of charge for my honest review.",1439683200,2,2263,4.359712230215828
7901570,4,9089701117,"This video started out with beautiful scenery and great morning scenes, but then there is was.  A big spider web.  No spider, just the web.  If you are like me, I don't care for spiders and was uneasy with the the sight of it on my big screen tv.  But oh well, I can just ignore this scene and move on to more beautiful scenery.  And that worked for a while...until it happened.  A big web with the spider included!  It was crawling and spinning a web.  What a shame!  This was a beautiful video and I was loving it until I had to watch two different spider crawling shots.  No where in the description did it mention spiders!  This video would have received five stars had it not been for the spiders.",1438128000,6,702,4.203007518796992
7901571,2,9089701117,This video was not what I expected.  It moves too very slowly and doesn't have much variety of scenes.,1428278400,,102,4.368421052631579
7901572,5,9089701117,"I'm a therapist, working with trauma survivors.  This DVD is wonderful to have running quietly in the background.  I do not make copies to give out but I think several people have bought it.  When I first played it at home, even my antsy husband relaxed.",1425254400,,254,4.478260869565218
