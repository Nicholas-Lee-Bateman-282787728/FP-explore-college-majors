His criticism to bureaucracy is handled with a great sense of humor. I would definitely recommend it. Good asset for a Cantinflas movies collector.",1374710400,,280,4.73469387755102
8583739,2,B001D1CRSI,"Sadly, this movie was poorly transferred into DVD--poor audio and visual--, looks exactly as if it was transferred straight from a VHS tape.  Unfortunatelly, I will not be ordering other Cantinflas movies (as I had planned), until I get some evidence that these films have been transferred into DVD in the quality that they deserve.  I'm not exagerating when I tell you that you will get a much better and higher quality recording if you do it yourself from TV next time the movie is shown.",1341273600,2,490,4.686046511627907
