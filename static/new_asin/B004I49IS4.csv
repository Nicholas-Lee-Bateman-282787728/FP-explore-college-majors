8430029,5,B004I49IS4,"I love the Ramayan.  My family including two young children (we read the subtitles aloud) watch it together all the time.  This is how we learned the story of the Ramayan and it has many spiritual truths to show us, within an awesome storyline!",1373760000,,244,4.5227272727272725
8430030,3,B004I49IS4,"We bought one set and found that some of the DVD's were defective. We asked for a replacement and they sent one immediately without us even returning the first. But it is also defective in two or three of the DVD's (I haven't finished playing all of the DVD's). The first DVD when the four brother's are growing up and the DVD of Bharat coming back home to find Ram gone are very defective. Half of those two don't play at all. But, I can't find Ananda Sagar's Ramayana anywhere else. It is so wonderfully acted that I play it hour after hour. Ram! is a true Ram, and Laksman grows on you because he is so adoring of Ram, the mothers and fathers of Ram and Sita are all fabulous. Sita didn't impress me at first but she grew on me and does a stunning job, almost the best of them all.  Ravan is so perfectly egotistical and does a fabulous job. I will keep my defective set because I cannot give up this beautiful, well acted version of the Ramayana. Jai Jai Ram.",1370908800,,963,4.205405405405405
8430031,3,B004I49IS4,"Ordered and got this dvd set. I was shocked that the dvds were cased in plastic bags; quality is ok. I thought they would come up with a quality dvd set. While the print is better than the original Ramayan, it is not that much better.",1368576000,,234,4.108695652173913
8430032,1,B004I49IS4,"I fell in love with Sagar Arts Ramayan when it was broadcast in India. Living overseas I forced to relay on internet based screening of the episode. I wanted to share this new series with my grandma as she and I had watched the original together. I was therefore delighted to see the DVD set available and ordered it straight away. I cannot fault delivery, they were very quick to take my money and send the set. However the quality of the DVD's has been very poor. The scenes stop and start, they freeze mid action, the links on the menus do not work at times. I have tried emailing Planet Bollywood multiple times asking how I can have this rectified with no answer. I would not recommend this product",1320796800,7,703,4.415384615384616
