7597128,5,B01AB4Y74O,"I was totally excited when the 9th season of NYPD Blue came in the mail. Couldn't wait to start watching the dvd's. I had to pace myself to make the experience last, so I allowed myself one disc per evening. I'm in the process of re-watching the season 9 again. Can't get enough of the actors, the story lines and that Captain Fraker- what a despicable man. Tony was innocent of the accusation. I'm so thankful that Andy had connections to uncover the captain's real agenda. I love the addition of John Clark and Rita to the squad. Looking forward to what develops between Andy and Connie.",1460505600,3,589,4.514018691588785

Franz is great of course, but Morales gets a chance to crank it up and really lets it fly.  No trail-dragging; no spoiler here, just the best cop show ever, still.",1460073600,,280,4.346153846153846
7597132,5,B01AB4Y74O,"This is AMAZING news .
Once I learned shout factory released season 5 and I went out and got
It right away and then counted down the days until the "" subsequent "" ( a commonly Used NYPD WORD!) seasons were released!

Being such a die hard fan I couldn't wait for the remainder
Of series so purchased a region free DVD player and purchased seasons 9 through 12 overseas and had them mailed
To me.  I will still be purchasing from shout factory because these region one DVDS offer closed captioning .  The region 2 DVDS do not and since I watch my TV on low volume to not wake my wife up- it's critical I can have that option.

NYPD BLUE is the greatest cop show in television history.  There is nothing today or in the past that even comes close to this amazingly written show.  I can't wait for the April 5th release of this season 9 DVD.

We meet Clark JR and SR. In this season as well as some new good characters like Julian Pisano and the whole Mrs Hornsby saga as well as a bigger role for EDDIE GIBSON early in the season with his overly-aggressive approach.  Also this is lutentant Rodriguez first full season and he filled fancys shoes very well.
He was a great boss.

Thanks shout factory for starting with the season 5 release .  There's millions of BLUE fans out there !!!",1455062400,6,1283,4.264462809917355
7597133,5,B01AB4Y74O,"I have one word to sum it up....""FINALLY""",1453075200,3,41,4.25
7597134,5,B01AB4Y74O,"YES!! Finally, NYPD Blue resumes on DVD as Shout Factory has now scheduled to release Season 9. With only three seasons left after this, and with Shout Factory's previous release of Seasons 5-8, this can only mean they've obtained rights to the rest of the series. A representative of theirs posted in response to my question about that with, ""I'm not able to comment on anything beyond S9 at this point, sorry! But glad we could continue :)"" However, several months ago they were still flatly stating that they did not have rights to the show beyond Season 8, so I'm assuming the ""no comment"" is a good sign. Those of us who have waited off and on for years since those first four seasons came out have renewed hope that the entire run of the show will eventually be available without having to buy a region 2 set or get a region-free DVD player. As soon as I find out anything new, I'll pass it along. Here's the URL to Shout Factory's page: [...]  As for the show, this is another great season of NYPD Blue. Andy and Greg remain the only holdouts from the first season, but the writing continues to shine and make the show seem like a continuation of the early seasons. Connie McDowell becomes more of a focus as her character draws closer to Sipowicz. Baldwin and ADA Valerie Haywood continue their relationship from Season 8. John Clark, Jr., aka Zack Morris, takes over the role of Andy's partner following the discovery that Danny Sorenson's character was killed off at the end of Season 8. Despite the changes, the show remained as strong as it had ever been, and in this season they find some new creative tension betwen Andy and Clark's dad, John Sr, aka Dutch Boy. And since Mark-Paul Gosselar managed to finish out the series in Seasons 10-12, he ended being one of Andy's longest partnerships. This was a great show, and it's fantastic news that a new DVD set is on the way.

**UPDATE** Season 10 is now available for pre-order, to be released August 23, 2016! Only two seasons left after that! YES!!",1452816000,13,2013,4.542699724517906
7597135,5,B01AB4Y74O,"The last I knew of ""Blue"", Shout Factory had resumed issuing the series beginning with Season 5, after 20th Century Fox had given up after the first four. Shout Factory got as far as Season 8, issuing them every few months. We waited for Season 9, but no soap, radio. Another reviewer on this site reached them for comment, only to be told that they'd only gotten rights to that block of the middle four. Now they seem to have gotten rights to at least this Season 9. Which leaves the last three. Here's hoping Shout Factory has acquired rights to those as well as this one.",1452556800,6,574,4.373831775700935

7597204,5,B01AB4Y74O,"I used to watch this series on a regular basis back in the day - the older episodes would be shown late nite and on Sunday afternoons while the show was still running, so I saw most of the episodes up through the RIck Schroder years. I used to think it was Schroder that killed the series for me, his character Danny Sorenson was a major irritation, but now in retrospect I'm not so sure that was all.

I never watched a full episode with Mark-Paul Gosselaar until I bought Season 9.  Not only is his character an upgrade over Sorenson but the show feels like it regained some punch over the previous few seasons.  Much better writing. Charlotte Ross also was a better actress than I gave her credit for - not just a pretty face.

On the negative, the trademark shaky camera seemed to all but disappear. Too much lighting at times - like a soap opera. And I can't give Jacqueline Obradors the same credit I give Ross - not a very inspiring actress at all. Maybe that changes for Season 10.

But a great quality DVD - Shout did a great job. Hope they release the final three seasons.",1461974400,,1082,4.310344827586207
