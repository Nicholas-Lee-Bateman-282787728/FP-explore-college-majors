3774563,5,B001RAZD7C,"OK, I have to admit it.  I love Zorro.  It is all Guy Williams fault!  This series was as good as I remembered.  Of course I also love Tyrone Power and Antonio Bandaras in that same role.  Then of course there was Frank Langella in the remake of the Mark of Zorro.  That was good, too!
I had forgotten about the relationship between Sargent Garcia and his Corporal.  That is really funny.  Great Guests like Caesar Romero, Richard Anderson and Annette!",1236729600,3,452,4.493827160493828
3774564,5,B001RAZD7C,love it it was most enjoyable and i've always been a fan of this series since watching it late nights on disney channel,1374364800,,119,4.217391304347826
3774565,5,B001RAZD7C,This is the one and only True Zorro!  It will bring back childhood memories or you can create some new ones with your family.  Let's create a new generation of litte one's running around with chaulk tipped swords....  Thats the way it should be!,1372204800,5,245,4.5227272727272725
3774566,5,B001RAZD7C,"Most baby boomers made a date on Thursday night at 7:30pm for their weekly 30 minute adventure with the caballero ""who makes the sign of the Z---ZORRO (add echo effect here)!  Such a shame that Disney pulled the plug on the program after Year #2.  But within those 2 years we got to know the Masked Crusader with the flowing black cape and his alter-ego, Don Diego Delevaga (both portrayed by Guy Williams)...Diego's Dad (George Lewis), Diego's trusted servant, Bernardo (Gene Sheldon), Capitan Monastario (Phil Ross) and roly-poly Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin).  Garcia was usually the foil in many of these episodes. Capitan Monistario thought that his newest plan would finally capture Zorro and Garcia would inadvertently louse things up!

There seems to be a little controversy about Season #2?  Was it shot in black + white or color?  The box of 5 DVDs represented here says: Color Digitally Mastered. Which could mean a colorization or a clean-up of an existing color print?  Either way it doesn't matter.  All of the full screen episodes look very good!  And many of the actors...including a very special mouseketeer who passed away in 2013...are fun to try and identify prior to the closing credits!

This set was very enjoyable...particularly because I used all my Disney Rewards Points to obtain it.  If you're not so lucky, but enjoy self-contained tales about the early days of California and the hero who kept dreams alive...buy this set!  It's another reminder that Disney product continues to be very special.",1369353600,,1526,5.011904761904762
3774567,5,B001RAZD7C,"Although the real Zorro has become a legendary hero through Walt Disney's vision, the portrayal by Guy Williams has met any and all expectations. He set the standards high for anyone who would later take on the role of Zorro. The action sequences were bold, daring, and intriquing for their time of presentation. I have enjoyed reliving my time in front of the television set to watch each episode unfold again. Thanks for making this second season available.",1361404800,3,459,4.897435897435898
3774568,5,B001RAZD7C,"everything i remember it to be ""BABOSO!!"" It was great to see it again and enjoy it just as much as i did originally.",1357948800,,117,3.9166666666666665
3774569,4,B001RAZD7C,"Even though it's old, the quality isn't too good and some of the story lines of the single-epsiodes aren't the best, it's still an amazing TV show. The characters each have their own unique personality, presented so well by different actors that you just fall in love with. The acting is incredible! No movie, comic or TV show has captured the heart and spirit of Zorro better than Disney did. The 1st Season is the best one for sure, but the show isn't complete without this second one. There are some episodes with not very good story's (especially the single-story-episodes) but the ""to-be-continued"" episodes are usually pretty awesome!",1357084800,,640,4.935185185185185
3774570,5,B001RAZD7C,What more can I say than classic Disney's Zorro.  There is no other Zorro to compare with Guy Williams.  If you don't like this series then there is something wrong with you.  The best of the best!,1355616000,,197,4.27027027027027
3774571,5,B001RAZD7C,The item was shipped and received quicker than I thought I would get it.  No dings or dents on the box.  This was a concern since it is a collector tin.  I am very happy with item.,1346284800,,180,3.810810810810811
3774572,5,B001RAZD7C,"After a hard week at work I need something mindless to help me relax, so I prchased Zorro colorized version First season. It has been more fun than I even remembered as a kid and the color is great. Don Diego's outfits are just stunning in color. Best of all, Zorro is always a perfect gentleman. You won't have to worry about your kids getting bad ideas for these movies. These movies are classic Disney 50's, so if you are young you may think they are corny and slow but, to us old folk they bring back a time of simple pleasures and moral standards.",1342569600,3,552,4.266666666666667
3774573,5,B001RAZD7C,Zorro takes me back to my childhood when things were much more simple and the villians always received their just deserts. What a shame Zorro was only on the air for three seasons. The last season consisted of one hour episodes. I hope they release those in a colorized version like the earlier half hour stories. The colorization is first rate and looks like these were actually filmed in color. Each episode is well written and the settings and background look very authentic. This set is a must for any Zorro fan.,1340409600,,516,4.619565217391305
3774574,3,B001RAZD7C,"I bought this season first because of affordability. The adventures continue, this time picking up in Monterey. Somehow the stories have lightened up a bit diminishing the sense of intensity drama and adventure.  Still the performances are top notch and there is plenty of good action. It's good to own the whole series, but given the choice, Season One was much stronger and complete unto itself. For many people Guy Williams is the definitive Zorro and he's done nothing to dishonor that claim. There have been many actors that played Zorro after Guy Williams, but only one was worthy to carry on the full glory of being Zorro, and the name of that man is...",1312761600,12,660,4.739130434782608
3774575,5,B001RAZD7C,This is a collection my brother has wanted for years.  It's well worth the money if your into Zorro.,1293667200,5,100,4.2631578947368425
3774576,5,B001RAZD7C,"I recall watching Zorro with Guy Williams when it first came on TV in the fifties.  I was hooked from the start.  The hero was amazing and the stories were well written, very well produced, and they have held up to the test of time.  I watched them all over again when Disney ran the Vault series over 10 years ago and I got most on VHS.  However, I still yearned for the DVD version.  My sweetie got season one for me for my last birthday (63) and we have both loved watching them.
I am tickled to death with this release.  I am certain that Amazon will provide the best quality and price.
I use Zorro in one of my film courses at the U of Michigan-Flint and in a history of TV class.  He represents the classic heroic figure, part of the community, who stands up at great personal risk to defend right in the face of great wrong.  The Zorro series combines the best elements of the Robin Hood legend and upgrades it to the days of Spanish California.  Watch this and enjoy.",1283212800,15,975,4.198924731182796

3774579,4,B001RAZD7C,"I loved Walt Disney's Zorro as a kid and am delighted that I was able to buy the complete Second Season in a colorized version.  I've had the complete First Season (colorized version) for several years and have been looking for the Second Season to be released.  The original series was in B&W, and purists don't like the idea of colorization, but I find it so much more entertaining to see the show in color.  Admittedly, the colorization could be a bit better in some places (some of the horses are a very strange shade of brown!), and the quality of the images themselves is not as crystal clear as I'd like (after all the show was originally filmed in the mid-50's), but the people, the clothes, the sets all look great in color.  I just love watching this classic old show in the colorized version - you miss so much when it's just B&W.",1266796800,5,841,4.406451612903226

3774582,5,B001RAZD7C,"Zorro is one of those fun series that you can not stop watching.

But before plunking down a great deal of money for this Disney Club colorized version, be aware that the general Retail release, with a suggested retail price of $59.99, is coming this November.  Amazon will most likely discount this to around $40.00 or less.",1242086400,18,325,4.684210526315789
