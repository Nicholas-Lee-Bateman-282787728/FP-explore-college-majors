2445419,5,B000BY896C,"This is the most amazing DVD musical recording I have ever heard and watched.  Cincotti is an awsome talent, and Monster Music has produced an absolute gem.  I saw Peter live at Jazz Alley in Seattle a few years ago when he was still at Columbia University and was hooked.  But this album is just so much fun to watch. And it's very emotional.  The band is world class.  Everything about this video is world class. Finally, the HiDef video and surround sound audio sets it apart from most other music DVD's. And Peter's ""I Love Paris"" alone is worth the price of the album.",1244937600,,573,4.419047619047619

2445421,5,B000BY896C,"Yesterday was my lucky day! Out on a walk (and out of the blue)
I found this DVD/CD package, still shrink-wrapped, on a street
corner along with other stuff someone had left there.
As I love music and especially watching it performed,
I snapped it up. I had never heard of Peter Cincotti
before, but the cover looked very promising. This is
one case where the contents more than live up to the
cover!

I played the DVD that evening. I listened to all the songs,
including the bonus tracks. Then I listened to all the main songs
and a couple of the bonus tracks again. I couldn't believe my
luck in finding this gem. A musical gift from the universe, indeed!

This is not just good music, it's transcendent. Peter and
his band work beautifully together. Someone here posted
that Peter's inspiration is what makes it happen. He sure
is doing something right--they all are!

I enjoy all the songs, and in particular
 Peter's songs, On The Moon and He's Watching.
I did a bit of digging today, and learned that (like myself) Peter is a Cancer sun sign (July 11), ruled by the Moon. So appropriate!

The genre of the music is hard to categorize. Bluesy,jazzy... the most apt
label I can come up with is ""trippy.""
Peter's piano playing is mind-boggling, his singing smooth and expressive, and his energy and enjoyment are infectious, I found myself laughing
along with him at certain high points.

I am very grateful that I (literally) found this, and I look forward to
hearing and seeing much more from this prodigiously talented young man and
his amazing band.",1233100800,7,1556,4.619565217391305
2445422,5,B000BY896C,"Peter Cincotti is a great pianist and singer; his voice is full of emotion and very sexy.  I am so amazed at his arrangements, especially the upbeat ""I Love Paris""; I can never sit still and always feel like dancing.  From fast songs to slow songs, he draws me in.  It doesn't hurt that he's charismatic and quite dashing as well.  His band is also superb and beyond awesome.  I wish there were more interviews on the DVD, but I would recommend it absolutely.",1156636800,3,459,4.416666666666667
2445423,2,B000BY896C,"Sometimes you bought a DVD hoping a great sound.

Sometimens you ger some DVD hoping a great hi rez image.

In this one I hope for both and I didn't get none.

Boring, easy listening, fully marketing oriented.

The image is too lighting.

Forget about it.",1143072000,3,255,4.456521739130435
2445424,5,B000BY896C,"Peter Cincotti has continued to grow as a performer of tremendous natural talent and great ability.  His easy, engaging style makes him a singer and pianist that you will want to enjoy again and again.",1142294400,2,201,4.742857142857143
2445425,5,B000BY896C,"What a joy it is to watch Peter Cincotti and his band on this great DVD ""Live in New York""!  Peter breathes new life into the songs from both his debut album as well as his most recent release, ""On The Moon"" which is included with the DVD.  You can hear the Ray Charles influence on ""The Girl I Knew"".  So much so that I was certain it was one of ""The Genius""'s songs!  What a pleasant surprise to learn that the song was written by Peter himself!  The performances are nothing short of excellent.  I guarantee, ""A Night in Tunisia"" will leave you speechless!  In this world of lip sync and lackluster deliveries of songs, Peter Cincotti is like a fine glass of Cabernet after far too many years of grape juice.  And like Caberbet, he will contiue to grow better with time.",1140652800,14,773,4.319444444444445
2445426,4,B000BY896C,"I ordered this without really knowing what to expect -- a 'live' concert recording perhaps? -- but the final product did not disappoint.

I've been a fan of Peter's music since his debut album release, and caught his performances at a showcase in Singapore followed by a Rome concert a few months later.

His Live In New York DVD features a comprehensive collection of all his famous works, from I Changed The Rules to Sway to St. Louis Blues and On The Moon. Filmed outdoors on a small neighbourhood street in NYC, it starts off in the day, then mellows into a beautiful sunset, before picking up the tempo as the stars emerge.

Lots of great energy here, as Peter jams with his excellent band and displays obvious enjoyment in his mega-watt smiles and rhythmic head-bopping. The sound quality on this high-definition disc is amazing, so make sure you watch it in the evening in a nice, quiet setting for maximum enjoyment.

I especially love his performances of Sway, You Don't Know Me and The Girl I Knew ( the last a bonus track and as yet unreleased ).

Guaranteed to satisfy all Peter Cincotti fans adequately. But I'm still hoping for a proper concert recording in the near future. An appreciative 'live' audience would be the icing on the cake.",1139788800,16,1252,4.647058823529412
2445427,4,B000BY896C,"Saw this at Fry's. I was blown away by the sax. His musical restraint shows his understanding and maturity of music. He is not showing off. He is painting a picture and trying to paint something that will never be painted or copied again. That is memorable and the stuff of musicianship. The arrangements of Bali Hai, a Ray Charles classic and others are new and have that artistic fresh blend that doesn't come along often. Peter's piano technique is not only incredible but because of it, he has the capacity to blend, flex and push the limits of his ability while drawing on the potential and musicianship of the band, which he obviously trusts. Possibly his inspired talent is the impetus for the band to become more than just ""the band"". He comments on his inspiration by the likes of Billy Joel, Elton John, and other greats that I cannot recall at this time (my memory is not what I wish it was) is evident in his arrangements but without being overly obvious - subtlety. The drummer uses an African influence for one of the arrangements that is subtle and well placed. This band is probably one of the most artistically orientated because they neither overpower each other nor want to. I have to admit I don't care for Peter's voice but it's ok. I AM impressed with his choice of musicians and this DVD was a welcome refresher to jazz. Most jazz to my ears is muddied, muddled and over managed. I hope to see more of this restrained simplicity in the future. Besides, I believe it is more difficult to play clean than to slide all over the place in hopes of hitting a decent chord.  BRAVO!",1137196800,4,1597,4.506896551724138

8093903,5,B000BY896C,"Peter sings (like a young Sinatra) but not only does he play the piano, he becomes the piano.  Okay, maybe not the greatest vocalist, but his delivery and communication is off the charts on the upside.  Get this CD and his live DVD made in New York if you want a couple of hours of pure musical enjoyment.",1388188800,,305,4.241379310344827
8093904,5,B000BY896C,Awesome dvd of a great informal concert. This guy was born 50 years too late. Would have given Sinatra a run for his money.,1353715200,,123,4.166666666666667
8093905,5,B000BY896C,"""This is a great deal! This set is better than any of my Michael Buble takes! I have not been unhappy with any purchases from Amazon in 6 years! Peter really does a great job on this CD. The dvd is excellent, and early into it you, you can see that the editing was very critical to the quality of the sound. Filmed in the neighborhood he grew up in, the street noise is gone, and the overlay of the music to the actual performance is perfect.
After buying Peter's latest CD ""East of Angel Town"" last January,09 at Amazon's recommendation; I was hooked on Peter Cincotti. The only key board artist who has this much savvy,(to me) is David Sancious.
I came back this year to purchase any work I could find of Cincotti's. Amazon had it all, at a great price!

8093906,3,B000BY896C,"I couldn't wait to get the Peter Cincotti Live in New York DVD. The reviews here were good. The audio was really the best quality I've heard. The mix was excellent considering it was done outdoors. My biggest gripe is the way the video was done. It is very tiring on the eyes when every 3 to 5 seconds the scene switches and most of the time it is in and out of focus. Certainly, the technique such as going to a soft out of focus to another scene is a common transition but these out of focus scenes were not intentional.  Most, if not all video was done using hand held cameras, constantly moving around so you never get to settle in to watch a great performance. It's like watching home video. The video editors are trying to show us how fancy they can get but it doesn't work for me. It seems to me that the video people should go back to doing weddings and Peter Cincotti should find himself a professional team that knows how to produce a video that he could be proud of.",1250467200,,977,4.196808510638298
