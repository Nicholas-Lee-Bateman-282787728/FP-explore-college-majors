3120097,5,B0013XS88Y,"This is possibly the coolest guitar instructional DVD I own. It's shot like a seedy, grainy old horror film and has plenty of blood and, YES, T&A! I remember thinking Paul Gilbert's hot assistant in Intense Rock sequences was awesome, but this instructional is a lot newer, and is a lot more provocative. I'll say it's a great approach, and leave it at that.

The main meat and potatoes of the thing is John 5 performing some of the songs off his new album (the title track, Werewolf of Westeria, Black Widow of La Porte and others) and then showing you, the student, how to play some of the licks in the songs. Even though John 5 certainly falls in the category of shredder, he has his own distinct style (which is a real accomplishment, especially in shred.) He really doesn't employ three note per string scales that much. (I'm going to go out on a limb here and say he doesn't use them on the DVD). Rather he has a deep affinity for the blues, country, and metal with the odd neoclassical flourish. He also uses chromatics often, so he can maximize the number of notes used (which is very clever). The result of this odd and refreshing style is that guitar gurus can learn a lot from John's licks. The heavy reliance on legato, insane atonal tapping, chicken picking, and John's original approach to arpeggios may broaden your horizons.

Perhaps the most valuable part of the DVD is the ""Improv Licks Lesson."" Here John improvs, and shows the student how to execute behind the nut bends, chicken pick, pull off Banjo Rolls etc. I must admit I just got the DVD and I haven't been to able play for the past few days, since I injured my little finger on my fretting hand while doing a marathon session practicing pedal tones with wide intervals. However, I must admit that this is all new to me, and I'm looking forward to incorporating these tricks into my playing once I get them down. The only I was familiar with were the pedal steel style double stops. I still think that it's great that he went over such a simple little trick, since a lot of young players seem to lack good bending/vibrato skills. I should also note that he is a great teacher. John plays the licks up to speed and then slows them WAY down. He even goes so far as to tell you note names, and which fingers to use. This is the kind of detail that is more akin to a private lesson than an instructional DVD.

John 5's ""The Devil Knows My Name"" is a great performance/instructional that features both an offbeat cinematic approach and an offbeat guitarist that I couldn't admire more. John 5 has weathered tragedy after tragedy, and he still finds a way to persevere and rise to the top. I highly recommend getting this DVD if you are an intermediate/advanced guitarist and like John 5's style",1206230400,17,2765,4.482142857142857

8253196,4,B0013XS88Y,"Yes, this video has eccentric and questionable graphical content, but any fan of this musician knows that this video is exactly his style and what you would expect goes on inside his head. Definitely mature, adult content, but my boyfriend certainly enjoyed it, as he is a huge fan of John 5! I believe that his lessons are easy to understand and is worth having a look at this DVD.",1515024000,,382,4.4714285714285715
8253197,1,B0013XS88Y,"Not a very good instructional guitar did at all, I wasted almost $40 on this dvd because I wanted to learn the whole songs on the devil knows my name album but he only shows you how to play like 2 parts of the song and that's it he doesn't even teach you the riffs or anything it's like wtf? There's also a bunch of s*** happening in the background during the lessons that actually started to hurt my eyes.",1476748800,,406,4.0875

8253199,2,B0013XS88Y,"John 5 is guitar player I have learned a lot from. I was really looking forward to this instructional video. It is mostly cheap horror/pornographic clips mixed in with him teaching you to play a few of his songs. This DVD goes very little into technique and playing improvement. Also this product is not suitable for young audiences, by any means. I would recommend saving your money and looking for something else.
Thank you",1432425600,,425,4.756756756756757

8253201,3,B0013XS88Y,3 stars is kind of a stretch but 2 would be too harsh. A decent enough video but not much in the way of instructional material,1407369600,,126,3.8846153846153846
8253202,5,B0013XS88Y,"John5 is a guitarist that manages to remain unique, interesting and truly a one of a kind talent in the guitar scene. That scene, one fraught with ""artist"" after ""artist"" who equally believe in their own superiority and artistic originality. Most fall flat at the alter of John5.",1328486400,3,279,4.833333333333333
8253203,4,B0013XS88Y,"Ultimately, your enjoyment of this video will largely depend on what you think of John 5 and his music. I happen to love his inventive, technically demanding and highly creative tunes. Both rocking metal and swing'n country. If you're a fan of John 5 and a student of the guitar you won't be let down. But it's definitely not for everyone.

The video is filled with bizarre imagery (mostly as background filler. There IS nudity, but it isn't of the erotic variety. It's mostly just very strange. Ex: topless women strutting about with animal heads). Seventies horror style camera work, weird lighting effects, creepy actors, disturbing sound effects and sinister makeup are just par for the course in Johns world.

As a teacher, John is fantastic. He plays through each song in it's entirety and follows up with a tutorial/dissection of the more difficult or unique passages in that given song. Slowing said part down to retard speed so ""we the student"" can get a clear view on exactly what he's doing. John specifies NOTES on the fret board through the whole video (ie; rather than saying 4th string 6th fret, he will say play the G sharp on the D string). I thought this was great as I'm keen on fret board memorization and mastery. I really appreciated his emphasis on musicianship as well as ""shredding"". The majority of his tutorials regard his metal material, but there are a few country bits at the end showcasing things like banjo rolls, chickn' pickn', behind the nut bends etc. As well as some bonus live footage of John soloing.",1276560000,4,1539,4.7388059701492535
8253204,2,B0013XS88Y,"I love John 5. This video is very poor. I think musicians need to understand that not all people who are fans are MALE. I don't want to watch naked girls while I am trying to learn guitar. Very weak video and barely any training on the guitar, more like a bad porno movie.",1226620800,11,272,4.055555555555555
8253205,5,B0013XS88Y,"this dvd is an excellent guitar lessons, is like a private class right in your room. very explicit in the tricky parts of all songs that john 5 performed. I like that he perform the songs live. I wish that this dvd was more extended but it worth the money! because you never see this kind of technique in others guitar player.",1215648000,3,326,4.274193548387097
