The DVD itself is fine, works as it should. The case is actually of the highest quality cases. Not one of those flimsy ones that seem broken when you buy it.

The downside? PRICE. It is outrageous that A&E and Amazon (whom make the DVDs) seem to think $13.50 per episode is okay. A single season of a show from this era tend to cost $13.50. Or ya know, streaming only costs $1.99 per episode but A&E will not stream this show (nor American Justice). It also no longer appears to be rerun on CI anymore. Sad.

A&E PLEASE RELEASE THE ENTIRE SERIES ON DVD OR DIGITAL DOWNLOAD. Stop hoarding these on your shelves.",1487808000,,706,4.415384615384616
