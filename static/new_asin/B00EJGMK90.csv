8606014,1,B00EJGMK90,two women with fake breasts and possibally two very quick flashes of real breasts. The one woman you really want to see naked is censored. Saying this is a horrible movie is a put down to all horrible movies.,1436140800,,208,4.358974358974359

8606018,1,B00EJGMK90,"Michael (William Patrick Riley) and Kasey (Sasha Formoso) have sex issues, in that they don't have sex since moving into her uncle's house. A demon satisfies Kasey while she is asleep, so she doesn't want sex, while Michael chokes a barnyard full of chickens. The film consists of them attempting to film themselves having sex for which Michael hires various production assistants, union men to light off fireworks, and a fluffer (Aneliese Roettger). They are also trying to get rid of the demon.

The movie falls flat. The humor is idiotic and not in a good way. The nudity is light, which needed to be pumped due to the lack of humorous scenes. The film attempts to be sexy with minimum nudity, but doesn't make it.  It is not an inspirational spoof.

 For instance, one of the better jokes was when someone says, ""There's a tiger in your bathroom."" Michel runs up to find a Tiger Woods look-a-like sitting on the bowl. By the time that gag happened, I knew what he would find when he got there. I guess if you are 18 and haven't been seen a comedy before, you might find it funny. I found it pitiful.

Sex and silicon Nudity (Aneliese Roettger )",1387411200,5,1148,4.526570048309178

8606020,5,B00EJGMK90,"Paranormal Whacktivity movie review. It's very a funny spoof of Paranormal Activity films and other great movies like Avatar, Ghostbusters, Superbad, The Hangover, Inception, and 500 Days of Summer. I can't remember all of the parodies right now. I'll have to watch it again a few times to catch all the jokes. Most of the jokes were pretty good and very different from your average spoof. I would definitely purchase this one and check it out!",1382227200,,444,4.855263157894737
