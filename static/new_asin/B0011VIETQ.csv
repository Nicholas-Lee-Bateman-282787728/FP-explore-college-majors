8242739,1,B0011VIETQ,thought i was getting [streetwise]  sadly it was something else with exact title. i did watch it. it wasn't a total waste. how many times can u watch a homeless guy battle dis interested throngs tryin to sell these newspapers...then to chow down on a couple slices of pizza. that was the most interesting story...there are a few more not worth mentioning.,1257984000,9,355,4.725806451612903
