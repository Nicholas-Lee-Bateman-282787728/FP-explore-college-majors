4399031,1,B004KZP81M,"While Micheaux was a Black film pioneer, many of his films were poorly acted, poorly staged, terrible with continuity, poorly edited, and almost incomprehensible. This is one such film. A grand mess. Even if you watch this film out of historical curiousity, you will either fall asleep or you'll eject this video long before the end. The shadows and lighting are so bad that you can't really make out what's going on (as well as the roar of the poorly preserved soundtrack). Find grandma's home movies of her winning the flower arrangement contest at the county fair and I'll guarantee that you'll find that more entertaining than this!",1059696000,3,636,4.898148148148148
8433634,2,B004KZP81M,A government agent tries to save a young girl from a local crime boss and immediately falls in love with her. This film is an early talkie with a predominantly black cast. Slim plot with painfully amateurish acting. Showcases some singing and dancing acts. The only reason to watch this film is for historical curiosity.,1529193600,,320,4.836363636363636
8433635,5,B004KZP81M,I loved this movie black secret service man who gets the criminal and a soul mate. Music was wonderful and the tap dance routine was on the money. The chorus line  was jazzy. This was a good movie with an all black cast in1932 am impressed  Last but not least the opera singer in the beginning of the movie sang angelic. This was a well made movie for its era. Thank you Oscar!,1493856000,,377,4.1506849315068495
8433636,2,B004KZP81M,"Most of this movie is pretty awful, but there are understandable reasons for that as explained in other reviews. But,a couple of elements were interesting. Part of the story concerned playing a local Harlem numbers game, which apparently payed only 550, where I thought most games payed 600. The real treat was the Harlem nightclub. I really liked the number with the chorus line! The band was also interesting, consisting of alto sax, tenor sax, banjo, piano, and drums. I thought I could hear a trumpet, but couldn't see it. I wonder if that was common.",1485734400,,555,4.791666666666667
8433637,3,B004KZP81M,This director has always interested me and this movie gave me more information about his technique and style.  The movie also gives the viewer a glimpse into life in the South during the 20's and 30's.,1473552000,,201,4.583333333333333

8433642,4,B004KZP81M,"The beginning of the movie resembles a silent movie but persevere, it is a pre-code, 1932 talkie.  This movie is considered to be one of Oscar Micheaux's better movies.  As I watched, I thought that the acting was on a level with amateurs putting on a play.  Later I read that Micheaux did indeed use non-professional actors in this and most of his other movies.  I also thought that the musical and dance numbers were overly long and generally did not advance the story.  Later I learned that Micheaux's movies are noted for having numerous musical and dance interludes and that his audiences liked them.  This movie is not well preserved and the sound is scratchy.  The music was probably much better when the movie was new.  Rather than complain about the sound and picture quality, we should be grateful that the movie survived at all.  Apparently about 500 of these race movies or black cinema movies were made and only about 100 survive.  In the days of segregation these movies were made by blacks, starred blacks and played in black theaters where they were very popular even though they were generally made with a shoestring budget.  Considering the difficulties under which Micheaux labored this is a pretty good movie.  I suggest reading a bit about him on the web to better appreciate the movie.  I think that as a movie this one is two or three stars but as a time capsule giving us a glimpse into American history, I'm giving it four.

I decided to watch this movie because the description states that it is set in Mississippi and because I could stream it via Amazon Prime.  I was a little disappointed that nothing, other than a couple of dialogue references, let the viewer know that the scene was 1932 Mississippi.  I saw a girl from Virginia, not Chicago until the very end of the movie when Agent White's suspect declares that she is from Chicago.  Also the Secret Service was under Treasury not Justice.
I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1457049600,5,1996,4.641025641025641
8433643,1,B004KZP81M,This rare film of Oscar Micheaux's not viewable in this cheap and amateur transfer from Synergy Entertainment. The top eighth? of the screen is chopped off so that one cannot see the actor's heads.  Did no one look at the transfer before before marketing this item?,1358121600,2,265,4.760869565217392
