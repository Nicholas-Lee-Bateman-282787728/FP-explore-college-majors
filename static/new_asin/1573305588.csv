191225,5,1573305588,"Our task today, should we accept it, is to compare and contrast two Christmas classics: ""Elmo Saves Christmas"" (featuring the broken snowglobe and grumpy Santa) and ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" (the late Jim Varney meets a much jollier Santa and gets more frequent airplay on cable TV).  Both movies are tailor made for the typical American viewing audience--that is, children and adults aged two to ten.  Both stories have a Santa who is thinking of retirement.  There are other surprising parallels as well.  Could the rumor that Jim Varney was the brother of Jim Henson (and the original man inside the Big Bird suit) be true?  Yet despite the fact that Varney has considerablely more range than Elmo, who really is nothing more than a less ambitious Pee Wee Herman with a higher voice, it's the little red monster who steals the show.
To be honest, I find it a little frightening that my little girl was so instantly drawn to Elmo, just as the designers intended.  We watch Elmo save Xmas about twice a day.  Our favorite part is when Santa gets stuck in the chimney (Laura will come get me if I'm not in front of the TV for that part), but we also like the incredibly raspy Easter Bunny as well.  Meanwhile, our two copies (primary and backup, just in case) of ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" sit unviewed in the video drawer.  No doubt about it: Elmo wins this race hands-down.
Buy the video, watch it every day for several months, and THEN tell me it's too long, or Santa is too grumpy, or all snowglobes should be unbreakable.  Just remember that me, my little girl, and the people who give out the Emmys think different.",985046400,2,1618,4.606271777003484
191226,5,1573305588,"I was surprised to hear other reviews comment on the length.  Our daughter has had no problem sitting through this video and she enjoyed every minute of it.  Granted, she is a big Elmo fan, but the story and the songs are so nicely blended that we all have enjoyed the movie--at least for the first 100 times we've watched it now. So but what I really like about it is that it's a new story for Christmas.  It seems like the same Xmas stories are rehashed over and over again.  But this story is new.  And it helped our daughter to understand that Christmas is a special time of the year.  And that message is reinforced with a couple of sweet new holiday songs. So I say, if you're looking for something new and different give this one a try.  And, don't worry, we haven't lost a snow-globe yet.  Sheesh. And yes, Durning is a Great Santa.  So he's grumpy.",980380800,2,857,4.273291925465839
191227,4,1573305588,"Wouldn't it be great to have Christmas everyday?  That's what Elmo thought, when he used the one of his three magic wishes, granted by Santa Claus after Elmo helped him get unstuck from the chimney.  When Santa realizes what Elmo has done, he and Lightning, a cute little reindeer, take Elmo through time to show him what life would be like if it were Christmas everyday.
They travel in the future, where the Count counts 193 days of Christmas on Sesame Street. Elmo sees that Big Bird is missing Snuffy, who went to visit his Granny in Cincinnati.  Big Bird is sad, because he can't see Snuffy or mail him a letter (because there is no mail on Christmas).  The children are also not learning because there isn't school.  Then Elmo visits Maria, who is unhappy about buying presents everyday and not working.  Then Elmo realizes that maybe it shouldn't be Christmas everyday.
The video soundtrack is really catchy!  The songs include: It's Christmas Again, Every Day Can't Be Christmas, Give Your Friend An Easter Egg For Christmas, All I Want For Christmas Is You, Keep Christmas With You All Through The Year.
Celebrity Appearances include Maya Angelou (as the narrator), Charles Durning (who is an excellent Santa), and Harvey Fierstein (as the Easter Bunny).
One thing that I disliked about this tape is that it is a bit long (most Sesame Street videos are 30 minute tapes, and this is an hour), so I think some of the video could have been edited out.  (I usually fast forward through the part with the Easter Bunny, because my one year old daughter gets a little restless during this part).  However, I think that this is a great video for the holidays.  My one-year-old loves it!",975542400,18,1686,4.684745762711865
191228,2,1573305588,"Although some of the classic Sesame Street sytle is here, this is way too long leaving the viewer wondering if this tedious story will ever end..and a grumpy Santa to boot!  What my kids remember most?  That Elmo shatters his snowglobe(no I'm not giving away the story.)  Now, every single snowglobe that has entered our home in 3 years gets the ""wish,wish'wish"" and thrown on the pavement treatment.  We just got Tim Allen's Santa Clause.  Pick that over this!  The magic is real and the plot keeps moving at a wonderful pace.  Humor far excels Sesame Street's also.  If you liked Elmo in Grouchland, you'll probably like Elmo Saves Christmas.  We didn't like either.",973296000,10,668,4.7894736842105265
191229,4,1573305588,"I have a major Elmo fan in my home.  My child is only 15 months old but loves the music and Sesame Street sights and sounds.  In this video many of the songs repeat throughout the storyline, my child is able to make a  connection and stay focused for the duration of the story.  Since I have to  watch this many, many times, I have to admit it is well written, fun, and a  joy to watch.  Plus they included one of my favorite writers and  storytellers Maya Angelou...Hooray for Sesame Street!",947721600,12,492,4.271739130434782

They get watched on a daily basis, so I decided to switch things up a bit and get him this Christmas DVD to watch. Once the DVD started, he lost interest very quickly because Elmo doesn't come on right away. I think I was expecting a ""newer"" movie... The description says it was made in 2004 (which I checked before ordering, because I wanted a newer movie)... However, it's most definitely made before 2004. There is nothing wrong with that, my son just enjoys watching the newer, colorful Elmo - like Elmo's World. So if you buy this thinking it's like an Elmo's World DVD, it's not.

I personally thought the movie was cute and has a great Christmas message, so I do think it's a great dvd. However I wouldn't purchase again for someone my child's age (13 months). He just didn't seem interested. I do know he will appreciate it more when he gets a little older though, so I will be keeping it!",1417305600,,976,4.362637362637362

It was cute and a good lesson for kids about why Christmas can only come once a year (among many other reasons) but I guess something about the whole way it was presented just bugged me. Not a great fan of this one.
The Easter bunny sounds like he has TB and I know that the man who plays him was a 90s actor, but casting should have called for someone who didn't seem so distasteful for the part.
Elmo, as always, was adorable and charming with his childlike naivety.

I believe that this movie could not have been made better. It was perfect and I plan to keep watching it and having my kids watch it in the future. People that say that this movie is too long or not good obviously aren't watching it through or not seeing it as a KIDS movie. It was made for kids 0-5yrs. to understand.

191396,1,1573305588,"My daughter loves Elmo and has for some time now and she is 2. He is definitely her fav character and we have several Elmo DVD's. Her favorites are Wild Wild West (loves to dance along with songs and likes cowboys now and says yeehaw). The other is Elmo in Grouchland (mostly the songs and she sings along sorta..).

KK, so I am glad I rented this one first before buying it because not only was it a major disappointment but it was a tremendous let down as well. I really wish I could pretend we never watched it and we only saw the first 15 or so minutes before I took it out and promptly returned it.

Now I cant speak for my two year old other than she really loves Santa Claus, I mean really loves him, but she was not interested in this movie at all and I don't feel like she liked the Santa clause in this movie.

Which leads me to why I did not like it at all and took it out and have given it one star. I felt like the Santa Claus was about the worst one I have ever seen in a movie. In fact, I really dislike his attitude and the way he treats his dog that wants to be a reindeer that is hiding in his bag. It all starts with Santa getting stuck in the chimney which for a two year old is probably confusing as it is.. why is he stuck? What if he gets stuck in our chimney,etc. Talk about a buzz kill, I really feel robed of the magic of Santa and Christmas by this show. The Santa actor made Santa out to feel like one of those drunk disheveled Santas. I feel like he was really rude to his dog too, not the loving kind and gentle Santa we know. For example the Santa in Polar Express, awesome Santa. The Santa in Flight Before Christmas, another awesome benevolent Santa. They add to the magic and show the warmth that you would expect not cheapen him like this one does. It's just the way he looks or talks, but the script that was written for him obviously.  I'm really disappointed in this one. Hopefully the Xmas Countdown will be better.  I'm just glad my daughter wasn't a little bit older, I think it would definitely create a poor impression of Santa on any child 3 or older as it did for us. My wife was in the room but was not watching it and she agreed. We're both rather young and 1337 parents as well so it's not a case of uptight atards either.

p.s. If you read over the other bad reviews you will see they all say the same two things.. Worst Elmo ever and Depressing and or very disappointing story line. Kinda says something when all the bad reviews strike the exact same chords. Oh and a few point out that at one point Santa quits. Really? Santa Claus would Quit his job and walk out because he cant take it? Does this sound like the kind of Santa you want your kids to believe in?",1291334400,4,2712,4.069288389513108

191407,5,1573305588,"In Elmo Save Christmas, Elmo learns that no matter how much he likes it or doesn't like it, you just can't have Christmas every day. And that if every day was Christmas, there wouln't be Christmas at all, and even a lot of business that are closed for holidays like Christmas, would have work piling up, which evnetilyy leads them to go out of business. So if your kids want Christmas every day, or jsut ask for it every day, instead of explaing it to them, just show this video, and let them discover for themselves just why you can't have Christmas every day.

As the special opens, some of the Muppets and Maya Angelou, are openning Christmas when Telly decides that he wants to have Christmas every day, which promptes Maya ask Telly, if Elmo ever told him about the time, he save Christmas, and then almost lost it again, so she tells them the tale. Now on Sesame Street, Elmo has gotten some Christmas cookies from Mr. Handford (David Langston Smyrl) and is going home to leave them out there, but the Cookie Monster wants to eat a few of the cookies, to help ligten the load, but Elmo (voice of Kevin Flash) doesn't let him, and he brings the cookies home, and leaves the cookies by the fire, and settles in to watch It's a Wonderful Life on TV, but does fall asleep in front of the TV that is blacked out and all you can see if flash. But wakes up when Santa (Charles Durning) gets stuck inside his chinmony, and Elmo pulls him out, and saves Christmas for girls and boys all over the world, or at least the ones that celbrate Christmas. And when Santa goes to open his bag, a young reindeer in trainning named Lightning is in his bag, and is in trouble with Santa, and he gets grounded, and is ordered by Santa before to sit in the back of the slay, and to be quiet, but before he leaves Santa gives Elmo an extra speical Chirstmas gift, and his chocies are a bear or a magical snowgolbe that grants wishes, and Elmo takes the snowglobe, and his first wish, which turns out to be for a glass of water. He couldn't just get up, and get himself a glass of water, without wasting a wish.

So the next morning comes, and Elmo is getting presents from Gordon, and his family, and from Carlo, and a hug from Rosita, and then the idea for his 2nd wish, and that is Christmas Every day. While the elves are planning their vacation, all of a sudden the toy machine starts up and again, and the elves report to Santa, and Santa tells himn that he gaves wishes to Elmo on Sesame Strreet, and has to go to see him, and all the reindeer are sleeping form having to work hard all night long, remember it is Christmas Day. And his only choice of a reindeer to take is Lighting. So they hatch him up on a slay, so back on Sesame Street the gang is at Hooper's store, watching It's a Wonderful Life, when a breaking news store breaks in, coverage gets taken to Kermit T. Frog, where he reports that it is Christmas again, and then they have to start planning for Christmas every day, so they go out to do more shopping, and then Elmo meets up with Santa, and gives him the speech about having Christmas every day, and signs him a song. And then gives him the chance to go in the future, to see what Christmas would look like next spring, when it is warm, annd the summer when it is hot, and then next winter, when it really is Christmas, so Elmo gets the chance to see if he really likes the idea of Christmas every day, and along the way he sees Big Bird (voice of Caroll Spinney) that is missing his best frerind Snuffy who is in Cincinnati, visiting his granny for Christmas, and he spends them time writing postcards to Snuffy telling him how much he misses him, when he knows that it is still Christmas, and that the mail doesn't get picked up or delievered on Christmas. Harvey Fierstein has a cameo, as the Easter Bunny. The songs are It's Christmas Again, Every Day Can't be Christmas, Give Your Freind an Easter Egg for Christmas, All I want for Christmas is You, and Keep Christmas with you (all through the year). And this special will explain to kids whether they like it or not, why Christmas is best kept one day a year.",1127260800,,4126,4.288461538461538

See Big Bird, The Count, Maria, and Bob have a breakdown! See an upset Easter bunny trying to sell Easter eggs on Christmas. Grover sells the christmas trees into extintion. Nobody works and people and puppets wander Sesame Street. The Hooper store, Fix It Shop and Finders Keepers all go out of business, because of Elmo's wish for it be to Christmas everyday. Kinda like Groundhog Day but its Christmas everyday. I think it OK for the kids to see, but very funny for parents to see the puppets breakdown! See it and laugh!",1102377600,2,702,4.535433070866142

The story is engaging, about how it would be to actually have Christmas every day of the year.  The tune ""It's Christmas Again"" is catchy and my little one dances around in circles whenever it's sung.  The sets are realistic and colorful, the costumes adorable.  Charles Durning is a sweet and gentle Santa and my daughter loves seeing Elmo interact with him and the Easter Bunny (a hilarious Harvey Firestein in a bunny costume, raspy singing voice and all)  Though not your usual story of Christmas, and certainly not much learning will be done during this tape, it's pure fun to watch and the songs are catchy.  Also, it lasts an hour so if you limit your child's tv viewing to 30 minutes and under you'll have to watch this one in two sessions.",1096934400,4,860,4.509677419354839
191411,4,1573305588,"Our daughter has been watching Sesame Street and Elmo's World since she was three months old.  She is hooked so bad that the last time we purchased an ""Elmo"" dvd for her, she would not let it go for hours.  This title is the only one that captures her attention, uninterrupted, from beginning to end.  I grew up watching Sesame Street so it's just as enjoyable to me -- cookie monster and grover was the ""elmo"" of my time.
I've read some reviews about this title regarding it being depressing, Santa being a grouch and Elmo being selfish (if you think that's bad, check out his behavior at the beginning of ""Elmo in Grouchland"") but I believe it has a good message about Christmas.  What child doesn't wish for Christmas everyday?
My current running count of viewings of this title is about 24 so check out these ""got nothing better to do"" tidbits:
- ""Forget about it"" is said four times.  Once by Santa, once by Grover's Christmas tree customer and twice by Santa's tall, dark-haired and bearded elf.
- Why can't Elmo say ""Feliz Navidad"" back to Rosita after she says it to him?  Elmo sounds as though he's about to say it but stops after saying ""Feliz...""
- During the final song right before Big Bird and Snuffy enter the frame, the camera is zooming out to a wide shot of everyone standing in front of the decorated Christmas tree, you'll see a boy standing on the green steps, turn his head towards the older person behind him.  Then that older person slaps him in the back of the head!
I disliked the use of XMAS instead of CHRISTMAS for the Daily Mews headline ""XMAS AGAIN! -- it's just me; I've always hated XMAS -- it's laziness. I also didn't particularly care for Harvey Fierstein's gay Easter Bunny number.
Overall, it is highly recommended by our daughter.  The count rocks!!! and counts!",1076112000,3,1801,4.537037037037037
191412,5,1573305588,"This feature starts off with Maya Angelou reading a story to some of the monsters on Sesame Street during the holidays. Christmas is so much fun on Sesame Street that they wish Christmas could be every day. Maya then recounts the year that Elmo saved Christmas and almost destroyed everyone's Xmas spirit. Santa gets stuck in Elmo's chimney and when Elmo helps him out Santa gives him a magical snowglobe which will grant him 3 wishes. Elmo wishes for Christmas every day and soon comes to realize that too much of a good thing doesn't end up so good after all. Big Bird almost loses it waiting for his best friend Sunffy to return from Christmas at Grandma's....if Christmas would ever end. Santa's elves are in desperate need of a vacation, Santa's ready to retire and Grover has run out of Xmas trees to sell. Nothing's getting fixed since Maria's fix it shop is closed for the holidays and everyone gets tired of the whole Christmas routine pretty quickly. It definitely makes for some funny scenes and songs when we see Christmas on Easter and the 4th of July. Elmo finally decides Christmas would be better off left the way it was and he takes his sled and his reindeer back to the night he pulled Santa out of the chimney. He picks another toy as a reward and Christmas returns to its cherised one day status. In contrary to what some other reviewers feel, I think this story teaches us to appreciate the holidays and not take them for granted. The holidays are special because they only come once a year. If you're looking for a traditional Xmas tale with traditional Xmas songs then this isn't for you. It's good for a different perspective on the holiday and for some lighthearted fun. My daughter is 14 months old and has loved Elmo for quite a while now. She loves this episode and I've even caught her humming along with the truly infectious songs which I catch myself singing throughout the day.

If it were not for his part in the video, I would have to say that this is our favorite Christmas video and one of our favorite Sesame Street videos (along with Let's Make Music).

The storyline is really more suited toward an older child of perhaps 4 or 5.  Also, while I truly enjoyed Charles Durning's Santa, I think a more ""jolly"" old St. Nick would've been more appropriate for the kids.",1009756800,4,600,4.427272727272728

The story itself is rather good -- Elmo wants every day to be Christmas, and so, with a bit of magic, he gets his wish. And then we get to see what it's like to have Christmas EVERY day.
