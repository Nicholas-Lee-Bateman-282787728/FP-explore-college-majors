8595010,5,B00DNJ99AW,"I LOVE this guy! Nothing is too far-fetched for Bill, and he will stop at NOTHING to get a little publicity. Or attention. Bill has created one of his most ""normal"" films yet called INDIE DIRECTOR. Although ""normal"" is far from anything he does. And who wants normal anyway? This film is a sort of How-To manual on making a movie. He has been accused of making ""porn"", but the definition of that is not at all what Bill does. Yes, his movies are full of gorgeous babes, dark humor, and tons of laughs; But what Bill ""causes"" the audience to do, is to sit back and just enjoy an awesome piece of art, while laughing (in all the right places) at at his crazy antics and glib writing. Why? Because he has a very unique approach to film-making, and I love it! It's very refreshing from all the politically correct garbage that's out there.  Bill does not ""play by the rules""; he writes, promotes and does just about everything he can to get his films out there. All on a very low budget.

Bill shows us just how difficult it is to for independent film makers to get the money and support to well, do what they do. It's a ""spot on"" look into this film-maker's world, and just how difficult it is to create these amazingly entertaining films.  Mainstream hates him, video stores ban his movies, but does that stop him from creating? NO WAY!!! And I for one am thrilled that he does what he does and to get a little peek at how he does it.  We watch as Bill works at getting funding for his movies, directs his luscious leading ladies and mostly pokes fun at himself. Again, so refreshing watching someone who does not take himself seriously; except for his art, which I'm quite certain he does. I see the passion he has for art and applaud him for doing what makes others cringe and run away. Pushing the boundaries of film and well, art; he does what I suspect others might want to, but don't have the...well, you get the picture. He does not follow the ""social agenda"" of Hollywood; and I for one, hope he never does.

Basically, this movie, along with being highly engaging, will teach you a bit of the deep, dark, sordid inside world of micro budget independent cinema; this is definitely one to be hailed amongst all Indie film folks for sure!

Yeah, Bill pokes fun at everyone. Himself most of all; so support Bill Zebub and watch INDIE DIRECTOR. You'll laugh, learn and be completely entertained. Bill, keep on doing what you do, and don't let anyone ever, ever, ever, EVER manipulate anything you ever do! EVER!",1378598400,12,2513,4.452173913043478
