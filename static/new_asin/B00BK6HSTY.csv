8569817,5,B00BK6HSTY,"Due to my limited English it's difficult to react to the other reviewers. But if I compare this excellent Thielemann performance with the rather dull performance by Barenboim who seems sometimes not able  to bring an orchestra to a higher level, it's for me very clear that the best choice is Thielemann. He feels the depth of this music, and his clear performances with so many details are better than any other performance and the Dresden orchestra has reached a very high levels since they're playing under Thielemann's baton.",1501286400,,529,4.943820224719101
8569818,5,B00BK6HSTY,"Anton Bruckner was born in Ansfelden, Austria in 1824. His Father was a teacher and taught Bruckner music from an early age, he was playing the organ by age six. Bruckner was thirteen when his Father died, the family home, a ""teacherage"" then being given to a successor teacher. Bruckner was sent to the Sankt (Saint) Florian Monastery to become a choirboy. In addition to the choir his lessons included the violin and the organ. Bruckner was in awe of the Monastery organ, but, became proficient in playing it. He eventually became a renown organist and played on many of the most recognized organs in Europe at the time. In 1871 he gave six organ recitals at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He had been appointed the organist at the Linz (Austria) ""Old"" Cathedral in 1856 and served until 1868. As his studies had included counterpoint and theory, he devoted more and more time to composition. Though he developed an individual style he was caught in the controversial period of Brahms versus Wagner. Criticism of his work added to his feelings of inferiority and led to his regular revisions of his efforts which added to the difficulty of determining which version was actually his own original thought. A listener to a Bruckner symphony will ""encounter some of the most complex symphonic writing ever created"". Scholars studying Bruckner's scores ""continue to revel in the complexity of Bruckner's creative logic"". In 1886 the Emperor decorated Bruckner with the ""Order of Franz Joseph"". Also in 1886 he was summoned to play the organ at Bayreuth for Liszt's funeral. He improvised on themes from ""Parsifal"" and ""got so carried away that he went on for well over an hour"". Bruckner was a known admirer of the music of Richard Wagner whose widow, Cosima, was the daughter of Liszt. At least seven authentic versions and revisions of this Symphony No. 4 have been identified. Here we have the 1888 version as arranged by Benjamin Korstvedt. Although Bruckner himself gave it the title ""Romantic"". Franz Welzer-Most and The Cleveland Orchestra are currently recognized as one of the most able interpreters of the symphonies of Bruckner. This performance from the St. Florian Monastery Church has additional special significance as Bruckner lived here, studied here, performed here and is buried here in the crypt directly below his ""favorite organ"".",1469232000,,2352,5.002551020408164
8569819,4,B00BK6HSTY,"I first saw this performance on PBS last year. Wonderful performance by the Cleveland Orchestra in the renown Abby of St. Florian in Austria. I recorded the performance and played it back several times before deleting it after about six months. Later I ordered the DVD version thinking the video quality would be the same as the HD television version. But, in my opinion, it is close but unfortunately ""no cigar""....I perceive some blurring, especially in the distance shots inside the Abby. Still it's an excellent orchestral performance, especially enjoyable are the flute and brass instrument performances.",1420588800,,609,5.288659793814433
8569820,5,B00BK6HSTY,"A very thoughtful interpretation of Bruckner's 4th, with exceptional solo performances by the principal players, especially the principal horn. The performance venue is beautiful with excellent camera work distributed between the players, conductor and surrounding architecture.",1401926400,,278,6.75
8569821,5,B00BK6HSTY,"Franz Welser-Most is a Bruckner specialist.  And The Cleveland Orchestra, frankly, seems to claim rights to being ""specialist"" at whatever they do - what an amazing orchestra!  This recording is from a live performance at St. Florian in Austria.  The sound isn't what we would expect from a performance in Severance Hall, the orchestra's home-town venue; but it is really quite good considering what acoustics are like in most large cathedral-sized churches.  Microphones were obviously placed carefully to allow a certain amount of reverberation without allowing the sound, including audience sounds, to ""echo"" as other recordings I've heard from similar venues.  Of significance is that this a performance of the seldom-heard first edition of this large piece which makes it a bit more special addition to my library of Bruckner recordings, DVDs and Blue Rays.  This is definitely a keeper.  Interestingly, this recorded performance was recently broadcast on PBS, and although it was well worth watching, owning the actual Blue Ray disc with 5-channel sound coming from a high-quality speaker system makes purchasing the disc well worth the price.",1399334400,,1149,5.385474860335195
8569822,5,B00BK6HSTY,"This is another in the series of Bruckner DVDs by the Cleveland Orchestra under Franz Welser Most. The video and sound are outstanding. The picture is crystal clear and the director focuses on many of the orchestra's musicians. Welser Most has run into a fair amount of criticism during his career, but this effort is absolutely first rate. The pacing is excellent, neither too slow nor too fast and the symphony builds to its dramatic conclusion. For those who like Bruckner, this should be purchased and enjoyed.",1377216000,4,514,4.919540229885057
8569823,1,B00BK6HSTY,"Biggest problem is the video - if you like to stare at the ceiling of the hall instead of watch the talented musicians of the Cleveland Orchestra, this video is for you.  The opening horn solo, and every time he plays the theme again, you get to look at the ceiling, a statue, or a view from 300 yards away.  You don't know who played it until the end when he is asked to stand and take a bow.  Artistic video editing?? They think so - the credits at the end include the whole gang from the grip to the sandwich maker with never a reference to the orchestra members who actually produced the wonderful sound.  The video producer hasn't a clue who is doing what in the performance as we get to watch the second flute while the trumpets have a beautiful pickup of the theme.  Next is the muddled sound - not the Cleveland I know.  Microphone placement or jet lag - but the ensemble does not sound up to the Cleveland I know.  Get a CD of the Cleveland doing the Bruckner 4.  Save some money and some frustration.  Missed my return window, so I am stuck with this ""drink coaster"" DVD. (and yes, I do feel strongly about these DVDs of classical music where the video is edited by morons and the microphones placed by monkeys).",1376611200,8,1222,4.278260869565218
8569824,5,B00BK6HSTY,"Franz Welser-Mst and his Clevelanders are arguably the most outstanding Bruckner interpreters today. Their Fourth, captured live under the direction of Brian Large in brilliant video and excellent audio, in the Stiftsbasilika St. Florian on 1 September 2012, is not only a perfect new installment in their recordings of the Bruckner symphonies but a small sensation in itself. Welser-Mst, most likely today's foremost Bruckner authority, uses the version of 1888, published by the American musicologist Benjamin Korstvedt in 2004 - first recorded on CD by Osmo Vnsk with the Minnesota Orchestra in 2010 in a very fine reading - thus setting a clear precedent on DVD for future performances. And the Korstvedt edition holds quite a few surprises for those of us who grew up with Haas and Novak. There are never-before-heard figurations in the woodwinds, violas and celli, significant nuances in the brass parts, smaller changes from the 1880/81 version in the first and second movements, a substantial - not unwelcome - cut in the Scherzo and, most obvious, a restored cymbal crash (expunged by Haas and Novak, still retained in the 1960s by some conductors like Jochum, Karajan and Steinberg) in the finale's reprise of the main theme. The cymbal crash (as well as the two following brushes) is not only quite effective but also a perfect climax in the symphony's texture, not unlike the Seventh's slow movement.

St. Florian has a long reverberation which the recording engineers nicely tamed: a remarkable feat. In the first few minutes a very slight harshness in the upper register can be heard until it disappears for the remainder of the performance. The Cleveland musicians are wonderful: every note is not only given its due value, but it is played and sculpted lovingly and idiomatically. Solos are superb and the ensemble could not be better. Tempi are, in my opinion, ideal. The first movement is assertive and full of unresolved tensions, the Andante quasi allegretto sustained by ""romantic"" longing and nostalgia, the Scherzo incisive with plenty of sharp edges, but elegant as well, the Finale a grandiose resolution in every respect. Welser-Mst is one of the few conductors who are fully aware of Bruckner's proto-modernist elements - often particularly audible as a ""subtext"" in the secondary voices - and he highlights them. This is a great Fourth that will stand the test of time and captivate you anew every time. Enough said, I want to listen to it again...",1376179200,5,2476,5.083538083538084
8569825,5,B00BK6HSTY,This is a wonderful performance of Bruckner's fourth Symphony. The Cleveland Orchestra is almost flawless  they had such an incredible ensemble that every breath is felt by the entire group. Welser-Mst is one of the best conductors where Bruckner is concerned. This disc isn't is perfect as the performance of Bruckner's eighth Symphony with the Cleveland Orchestra (they had the advantage of performing in their own Hall) but it is still extremely wonderful.,1370649600,5,459,5.287671232876712
8569826,5,B00BK6HSTY,"Welser-Most has been supported by a major Upper Austrian bank for over 25 years now as a cultural envoy. This level of support suggests that Welser-Most has something special to offer in terms of Austrian music especially. In particular, Welser-Most has a passion for Bruckner that translates into meticulous orchestral preparation followed by performances of remarkable detail that manage to still come alive musically. These general observations apply to this new recording.

This recording is a performance of the 1888 version of this symphony in the new performing edition by Benjamin Korstvedt. The result is a performance of considerable splendour. The description of 'Cathedrals in sound' is easy to comprehend here, especially in the splendid setting of St. Florian in Austria. There are other versions of the symphony which may be more familiar but Welser-Most believes this new edition of the 1888 version is now the best.

I have grown to like this edition and interpretation very much indeed over several viewings. As with his previous recordings of Bruckner, Welser-Most's performance displays a typically very clear and long-term view of structure held under tight control but driven by a deeply held conviction. The climaxes are massive but this is balanced by considerable moments of delicacy, almost down to a whisper. There are times when woodwind lines are almost played like solo lines in a piece of chamber music. The orchestra is well able to deliver at this level.

The concert is well recorded by Brian Large and presented in DTS 5.1 surround and stereo sound formats. The sound in its DTS format is particularly spectacular in effect. The camera work is detailed without being invasive and is typical of the knowledgeable and sympathetic direction by Brian Large. The imaging is especially crisp and of good colour definition.

This seems to me to be a very fine entry in what is building to be a very significant series with a very personal and justifiable choice of editions. The standard of music making is of a consistently high calibre as is the recording quality. Welser-Most himself is clearly dedicated to his task and I would therefore suggest that this will give purchasers much pleasure and food for thought.",1365897600,10,2244,5.122950819672131
