1409755,4,B000059XY9,"i don't think anyone else has mentioned this, but the three episodes on this video are:
- mutant crush, feat. the blob and jean grey
- speed and spyke, feat. spyke and quicksilver
- and middleverse, feat. nightcrawler and forge
these were the orig. ep. 4-6 in season one of the evolution series and thus they were the first appearances of the blob (who gets recruited by mystique and who develops a crush on jean grey), spyke and quicksilver (former friends who get recruited by mystique and the x-men respectively), and forge who has been trapped in a place outside of time b/c of an invention gone slightly awry and who gets brought back when nightcrawler gets ported there.
worth 3 or 4 stars, although these episodes aren't nearly as good as the later ones, such as the ones late in season one and season two. if i were going to get just one of the vhs tapes i'd get one of the other two first, esp. since both of those inc. an episode w/ rogue.",1042588800,,949,4.3977272727272725
1409756,4,B000059XY9,"The original X-men did cover a few adult issues and was quite heavy for younger children. These new series are really well done though there is a hint of The New Batman-Superman Adventures style. Overall, quite well done. The new versions of Sabretooth and Wolverine is better although there are some disappointing things such as Toad's strange and scrawny body. It doesn't look like his figure was supposed to be adapted from any place, nor comic or movie. Magneto's boundaries are better at some levels and worse than others. But the fresh plot always wants you to view it over and over again.",1015545600,4,595,4.786407766990291
1409757,5,B000059XY9,"As a long time fan of the X-men, I love X-Men Evolution Just as much as the rest. I think any true fan will. The new spins on the characters are just fun.",996278400,,154,3.696969696969697
1409758,5,B000059XY9,"I've been an X-Men fan since I was 14 years old.  (okay so that was only 8 years), and I've seen the other X-Men cartoon.  I don't know about others, but I have to say that this cartoon gives a good story even if it isn't exactly like the comic books.  I like the way they present the characters; very much what I would imagine them to be animated.  Yes, some things change.  But that is to be expected.  I think X-Men Evolution in itself presents a very good story to follow, nice animation, and great characters to enjoy.",996019200,,523,4.232323232323233
1409759,5,B000059XY9,"For anyone who has read the original comics and seen the original series, you will be throughly surprised by this new installment.  The bad points: Almost every X-Man and Brotherhood member is either a high school student or teacher. Mystique is the principal. Toad, Jean, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Cyclops, etc are students. Wolverine is sorta a mentor for them at Xavier's home. The school they go to is not Xavier's. It is a public high school. So they must deal with hiding their powers and looks, for some of them.  Good Points: Animation is excellent. The best I have seen in a long time. I love the way Nightcrawler looks. The stories are well written. And for the most part, they have kept the key pieces of the original stories true. Wolverine and Sabretooth having a past, Wolvering not knowing everything, Rogue/Mystique and Nightcrawler/Mystique ties. Cyclops/Jean relationship.  I am a new fan of X-Men, brought on by the hit movie and I do like this show. I am unsure whether die-hard, long-time fans are welcoming it as much. I think for the kiddie set (I am 22 years old), it's a good show and teached valuable lessons, as the comics from yester-years have taught about racisim and family.",989020800,3,1200,4.78743961352657

7934401,5,B000059XY9,Again I am a major nerd - used to watch this show on KIDS WB on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal and the box and jug of milk by my legs. LOL! Its toned down due to it was geared towards kids - only draw back: it wasn't all packaged together like S3 which was all one set and they STILL have not realeased S4 on DVD! I love X-Men anyways!,1386288000,,348,3.7162162162162162
7934402,3,B000059XY9,The series start is decent.  Don't expect it to follow old story lines and you won't be disappointed.  A pretty good buy for any Marvel or just X-Men fan.,1257033600,,154,4.275862068965517
7934403,5,B000059XY9,"Being a fan of the early 90's X-men cartoon series we were loathed to give this new series a chance. However, after giving it a chance with an open mind we will say will say it did grow on us. No, it doesn't follow the comic story lines. It is more of a mixture of the comic book and the movie series. The Spike character is similar to the godson character in the 90's cartoon series in his relationship with Storm. Different powers, but similar idea. The volume is still early in the series so everyone is still being introduced. The series production was pretty good. Good theme song and the character development was done well. The only thing we disliked about this disc is the fact that you have to collect 5-6 dvds to get the whole season. Too bad the series wasn't collected until the third season. We know it lets them make more money, but by now the series should have been put in a collection.",1254787200,,902,4.34319526627219
7934404,5,B000059XY9,The DVD's X-men evolution is a mixed of interesting history (nearly to comic-book) with good draws and a lot of action. All DVDs are excelent to collection fan,1168473600,,159,4.714285714285714
