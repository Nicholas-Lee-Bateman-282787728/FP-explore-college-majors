8298562,5,B001EL4ICU,"I received the item in the condition described, packaged properly, and in a timely manner.  This course is an excellent overview of the Bible, and I recommend taking the course.  I purchased the videos and the study manual to use in our homeschool with our children, after my husband and I had taken the course at church.  I highly recommend this item and this seller.",1231977600,,368,4.630769230769231
