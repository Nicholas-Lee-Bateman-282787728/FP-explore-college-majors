8507323,4,B006ZYCH7O,"My son loves Elmo.  This movie lost his interest pretty quick though.  He loves Elmo in Grouchland and Best of Elmo 1 & 2 much more, this movie is now a back up movie if nothing else is available to watch.  I watched the whole movie and I thought it was cute but apparently it isn't quite enough to make my 2 year old sit still and watch.  :)",1365465600,,342,3.9130434782608696
8507324,5,B006ZYCH7O,"My son loves Sesame Street especially Elmo. There were episodes that he has never seen. They were cute, and the best thing of all they were all about ELMO!!! A great movie a must buy!!!",1349395200,,185,4.314285714285714
8507325,5,B006ZYCH7O,"My 15-month old is a little Elmo-obsessed, since getting this DVD as a gift.  All the stories feature Elmo, and everything is pretty recent.  There's a story about growth charts and Elmo wanting to grow faster, a story about Elmo being a butterfly, and a story about a TV show Elmo participates in called Cast Iron Cook (a spin-off of Iron Chef).  There are a few songs, but no celebrity guests.  Abby, Telly, Chris, and Alan also show up.  Refreshing and captivating for little ones!  Some Sesame Street episodes can be annoying for the adults after repeated viewings; not this one.  We highly recommend this one.",1345939200,2,614,4.735849056603773
