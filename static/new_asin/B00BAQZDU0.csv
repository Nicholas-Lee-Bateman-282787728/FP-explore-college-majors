5565077,2,B00BAQZDU0,"I love Mark Wahlberg and I bought this movie before it was available to rent because he always does a great job. His acting was great, but the movie just drag on and it wasn't one of those movies that was 'exciting'. It had a good ending, but I barely even watched the whole thing and with Mark Wahlberg in it that says a lot because hes one of my favorite actors. I would rent it maybe, but regret buying it because it was a waste of money.",1365552000,,441,4.0227272727272725
5565078,1,B00BAQZDU0,"Wow these actors (all great ones at that) must have really needed the money.  There was nothing unique, ground breaking or special about this movie in any way.  The same acting, script and style that has been done in every crime, action and cop movie ever done, minus the subpar script.

Private investigator Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) is struggling to make money. When Mayor Hostetler (Crowe) hires him to follow his wife to see if she is having an affair Billy is offered an amount of money he can't turn down. After his findings lead to a murder Billy isn't sure who to believe anymore. I have to admit that I wasn't all that excited about this movie going in. Not a big Russell Crowe fan and the movie looked a little too generic from the preview. While the movie isn't really anything that new I really did enjoy this and was entertained the entire time. There were enough twists and double-crossing going on that it kept me guessing who was telling the truth the entire time. That to me is the sign of a good movie. This is not a movie that will become a classic or win a bunch of awards but it is very much worth seeing and is very entertaining. I recommend this. Overall, a good movie to put in and try and guess the end. I give it a B+.",1364947200,51,1057,4.343434343434343

5565083,3,B00BAQZDU0,"""Broken City"" (2013 release; 109 min.) is a political crime drama in which we meet Billy Taggert (played by Mark Wahlberg), an ex-cop who is now a struggling private eue in New York. One day Taggert gets hired by New York's Mayor (played by Russell Crowe) to check out the Mayor's wife (play by Catherine Zeta-Jones), whom the Mayor suspects of having an affair. Taggert gets on it right away and wouldn't you know, he finds the Mayor's wife in the arms of the campaign manager of the Mayor's opponent in the upcoming election. Will this impact the Mayor's re-election prospects? Or will it torpedo instead the Mayor's opponent? Are there other twists and turns? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your vieweing pleasure, you'll just have to see for itself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are expecting an action movie (as I did, having seen the trailer in previous weeks), be forewarned! This is an all-talk, hardly any action, movie. The first (and just about only) action comes 75 min. into the movie when there is a brief car chase. Then there are a couple of fist fights, but that's about it. This is in and if itself not a problem, if the talking leads to a compelling drama, in this case a political crime movie (similar to, say, the all-talk ""All The President's Men"". Alas, this movie is no ""All The President's Men"".

There are several noteworthy performances, first from Russell Crowe, who seems to enjoy his role of the overly zealous Mayor. Catherine Zeta-Jones as his wife steals several scnes with her charm. But the biggest surprise for me was Alona Tal as Kathy, the office assistant of Taggert. I don't think I had seen her before. Can't wait to see where she goes from here. I also liked the soundtrack quite a bit (scored by Atticus Ross). Meanwhile ""Broken City"" is not all that bad, but not all that great either and it is not the action movie that the trailer had lead me to expect.",1358640000,13,1948,4.547008547008547
5565084,4,B00BAQZDU0,"Billy was supposed to be one of New York's finest on NYPD. However, his career and his reputation crumble to pieces, after a shooting took place. Some time later as an ex-cop, Billy accepts an offer he cannot refuse, the money was too good. His mission is requested by the Mayor to find his wife's lover. Billy takes the case as a private detective, but gets involved too deep to turn back, after realizing he made a mistake accepting this job. He tries to keep clean as he finds the odds are more-and-more against him. Billy then decides that with his freedom and his life on the line, he has to come forward to reveal the truth in the city that never sleeps. Compelling story, acting is good, filled with suspense, and unstoppable action. The drama becomes as intense as the scandals, and cover-ups. Overall, interesting mystery that holds your attention. Highly recommended!",1358640000,2,877,4.738562091503268
5565085,2,B00BAQZDU0,"A former cop with the New York City Police Department had been double-crossed and framed; seven years later he is hired by the mayor to track a (possibly) unfaithful wife.... Why does this sound so familiar?

...Sigh...There is nothing new in this l-o-n-g (109 minutes) R-rated action-filled mess. Dirty cops, corrupt politicians, unfaithful wives, deadbeat customers, you know the drill. My biggest problem was finding someone I could root for! Maybe that darling secretary? Maybe the lover?

I watched:
  * Mark Wahlberg (""The Fighter"") is Billy. We want to root for him, but we can't forget those first scenes.
  * Russell Crowe (""Les Misrables"") is Mayor Hostetler. His phony smile can't disguise that little twitch under his left eye when he is tense.
  * Jeffrey Wright (""Source Code"") is Police Commissioner Fairbanks, who has me confused: is he clean or is he dirty?
  * Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Rock of Ages"") is Cathleen, the Mayor's wife. Is she or isn't she faithful?
  * Kyle Chandler (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is Paul, a political operative who is, believe it or not, the most decent guy in the whole movie.
  * Alona Tal (Lots of TV) is Katy, Billy's Girl Friday in his private detective business. She's sweet and resourceful.

Expect gunshots, fisticuffs, vehicular mayhem and LOTS of talk, which, I was surprised to note, includes very little profanity. The R rating seems to be due to the violence of some of those fist fights. It struck me as funny that everyone is constantly drinking but absolutely no one smokes.

All in all, I didn't find this movie very involving; most of the characters seemed to be at arms-length. The talky script is Brian Tucker's first time out, so next time Mr. T. try the less-is-more rule and use two words instead of twenty, okay? Especially when you have them speak sotto voce and many of us in the audience can't make out most of that blasted dialogue. If you get the DVD from Amazon.com, at least it will have closed captions.",1358380800,15,1972,4.807121661721069

5565104,5,B00BAQZDU0,"I enjoyed this film. I am surprised it got so few reviews. Granted that the plot has been done before, but this time the acting is better and there are small differences that make the film enjoyable. I was not a fan of Mark Wahlberg, but I saw a few films where he starred recently and changed my mind. I think he acted splendidly in this film, as did Russell Crowe and the other actors.
The Wahlberg character killed a black man, and because he was white the city prosecuted him, of so some people said.  But then a film was revealed that showed that this was murder. The crooked mayor, Crowe, kept the film hidden. While Wahlberg was found innocent at his trial, the mayor fired him.
Seven years later, Wahlberg is a private eye. The mayor hires him for $50,000 to find out with whom his wife is having a sexual affair, or so he says. Wahlberg finds that the wife is seeing the man who is aiding the mayor's opponent in a new election bid, or so it seems.
The man is murdered.

5565123,3,B00BAQZDU0,"Broken City
 Broken city is a tight, intriguing crime drama set in the seedy, sinful city with two names, New York New York.  If we can believe the movies, New York is full of double dealers, two facers and worst of all, those in high places who stoop so low as to murder.  Money, filthy lucre, is the root of all evil and its lure is too strong for the characters in this film.
 Russell Crowe, in his second in a row role as the bad guy, plays the mayor of New York.  He is so warm, so charming, such a classically a New York politician that I am sure I would not only have voted for him but I would have worn his button on my shirt.  He is such a smooth and adept liar that he could buy your vote with your own stolen wallet then return the wallet for a reward.  Crowe is magnificent.
  He is backed up with fine work by Mark Wahlberg as the earnest young ex-cop who becomes His Honors unwitting dupe.  Wahlberg has the not too bright striver with a good heart down so well that I hope never to see it again.  He has perfected that role, time to move on.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is also quite strong as the wife of the dirty mayor.  She also has her secrets, as does the good hearted ex-cop.  The slow pealing back of the layers of double dealing and hidden agendas keep us watching.
  In a rare superior first time effort writer Brian Tucker has turned in the best script in the very young new-year.  Hollywood producers do not often trust first time script writers with a major production and in the few times that they do it is not often successful.  Tucker combines believable dialog with plot twists to give us a genuine entertainment experience.
 Mark Wahlberg and director Allen Hughes are the producers.  While they have done a remarkable job of movie making, this one hasn't found its audience.  Wahlberg and Hughes are likely to take a financial drubbing on this fine three and a half saw blade crime drama.  Their $35 million investment has returned only some $18 million in three weeks.  Hughes also directed the excellent Book of Eli.
 Broken City is rated R for some very brief nudity and adult themes.  It runs one hour and 49 minutes.  Fans of well done crime drama will like this one.",1469923200,,2201,4.333333333333333

I think both people were just as good and if any slower, would not be as good as a movie. Also, it was hard to picture Russell and Catherine as husband and wife, so the relationship-or lack of, was perfect in this one. I actually had to watch it all over to  put all the pieces together. But, this was a good movie that made me think. Also, Mark and his smart-mouth, sharp-tongued assistant had good chemistry in the film. I wouldn't own it, but it's definitely worth watching.",1434067200,,617,4.318965517241379
5565175,5,B00BAQZDU0,"This movie is kind of a modern ""film-noir"" about New York City, involving the exact kinds of characters one would expect to see in a 1940s film of such type: the private detective with a troubled past, who gets ensnared in a crooked plot; a dangerous femme fatale; a deadly murder; wealthy bigshots making illegal deals; a corrupt administration; a tightly-fought election; and a lot of double-dealing.

New York is mostly seen at night (like most film-noir), overladen with evil and menace (like most film-noir), all the characters have hidden agendas (like most film-noir), and the good guys take it on the chin (like most film-noir).

There are modern touches -- the 1940s films, with their Hayes code restrictions, could barely touch on sex, let alone adultery, interracial sex, and homosexuality -- but the scenario is pretty much the same. Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet, and Mary Astor could easily replace this film's characters.

What makes the film enjoyable for me are the characters and the acting: Wahlberg, Crowe, Zeta-Jones, and Barry Pepper put a lot of energy and depth into their roles, and come off as highly recognizable and very real people, all caught in a trap of their own devising, ultimately all becoming victims of their own plots. The title is very apt: ""Broken City,"" as they all try to repair their situation, and cannot.

I'm surprised this film got mixed reviews when it came out...I enjoyed it immensely, and I think fans of both film-noir and New York City will enjoy it, too.",1433203200,,1535,4.937984496124031

While the story may be fictional, the screenplay was written by a young, African American writer whose first screenplay was on Hollywoods black list, which in itself is an interesting tale.  The storyline is similar to The Lincoln Lawyer--a client who hires a criminal defense lawyer to represent him because he committed a murder for which another client, of the same lawyer, was serving on death row.  Broken City uses that same kind of twisted manipulation by the Mayor of New York (Crowe).",1428883200,,568,4.835051546391752

5565241,3,B00BAQZDU0,"Broken City has fine cinematography and a heavy-weight cast including Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The crime drama also benefits from solid supporting performances from Barry Pepper and Jeffrey Wright. But the film somehow lacks something that would have made it another L. A. Confidential. Perhaps it needs a more interesting story and characters.

Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg), a disgraced NYPD officer, now working as a private investigator, is hired by NYC Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) to find who is having an affair with his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Of course, thinks are not what they seem, and as Billy investigates, he stumbles upon a few nasty aspects of the Broken City, or a web of conspiracy.

The idea looks great on paper, but Broken City suffers from the lack of originality and storytelling skill. There are a few twists and turns in first-time screenwriter Brian Tuckers screenplay, but they are either predictable or implausible, or even silly. What is worse, the subplot about Billys relationship with his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez) goes nowhere.

After all, while Russell Crowes performance keeps mesmerizing, you really don't care whatever happens to those characters in Broken City.",1404345600,,1285,5.447236180904523

5565248,4,B00BAQZDU0,"Two things set this movie apart from all other renditions of a similar theme:  Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe.

The basic story has been done infinite times:  husband hires a private eye to follow his wife and confirm his suspicion that she's having an affair.  That's not a spoiler, folks, you learn this in the first few minutes.  What makes this story interesting tho, is where it goes from there.  You are pulled into an increasingly complex story of dirty politics and lost loyalty by compelling performances from Wahlberg and Crowe.  It's a good movie, well worth the money to buy and watch more than once, especially if you're a fan of these two actors.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  Wahlberg gets annoying with his lack of expressions.  His face could fit on Mt. Rushmore because it always looks carved in stone with the creases between his eyes to show...what?...determination?  Anger?  Worry?  Yep to all three.  But I think he might have taken some acting classes, or maybe he watched how Crowe did it.  Whatever, he is much better than usual in this movie.  And of course, R. C. is always watchable.  He was born acting and this movie was no strain for him.  He's able to command the viewer's attention with no effort, it seems.

The twists to this story make it memorable, enjoyable and interesting.",1394582400,,1331,4.683982683982684

5565255,3,B00BAQZDU0,"The late Massachusetts Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tip ONeil, was always fond of saying that all politics was local, meaning, perhaps, that the great struggling issues of the day did not mean a thing if some constituents potholed street was not paved. The truth of that proposition, if it ever was true, has certainly been eclipsed on the national and international levels by the huge increase in media technologys ability to create messages and sway opinions. The one place that Tip statement may still retain some validity is, well, at the local level, at the level of city politics. And that premise was on display in the film under review, Broken City, although one could argue that the city involved, New York City, as an international city would conform to that latter statement.

So be it, though the story line of this film pits an old-time machine up from the ward- heeler ranks to the mayors office politician played by Russell Crowe. His honor though is up for a tough reelection campaign against the inevitable clay-footed liberal reformer. So every trick in the urban politicians handbook comes into play. That and a little murder, mayhem, and dirty tricks. Just like the doctor ordered. Except this film is billed as a suspense film and so the plotline has to be developed a little.
His Honor finds that he needs to purchase the services of an ex-cop, rogue cop, (played by Mark Wahlberg) who after being pushed off the force became a private operative with a specialty in keyhole peeping. Seems that, on the surface anyway, the Mayor was trying to find out about who his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was having an affair with behind his back and thus placing him in an awkward political position with Election Day right around the corner. And so our key-hole peeper does his work, does it well, except a guy, the supposed lover who also is the campaign manager for that reform candidate eating into the Mayors gravy train is murdered right in front of his house, an obvious political hit job.

Of course that event turned things on their heads since our key-hole peeper was set-up by the Mayor to be the fall guy, and/or patsy to the real grift, a huge pot of gold for the Mayor and his cronies with the turning of a low-rent neighborhood into a high- rise city skyline playground for the Mayfair swells. Despite the reform candidate, despite the ordered murder, despite the graft and corruption come Election Day the Mayor wins. Except in the background our hero private operative gets the goods on the Mayors deal, fills in the dots, and His Honor is finally led off to his just desserts. Yeah, you know Tip might have been right even, maybe especially about New Jack City, follow the money, all politics is local on that score.",1392508800,,2773,4.739130434782608

It's broken all right, with talented actors squandered and going through the motions in this paint-by-the-numbers, largely dispirited and listless, meandering melodrama.  Crowe is miscast as the mayor.  Not much he can do when the script is utterly lacking in dramatic edge.  Wahlberg bounces hither and yon, a disgraced cop who is summoned by the mayor who fired him (in a ridiculously unconvincing scene -- someone forgot to tell the screenwriter that mayors don't fire cops) completely out of the blue years later, to spy on the mayor's wife and see who she is sleeping with.  Why summon Wahlberg?  Makes no sense.  And when Theta-Jones, the mayor's wife, who is being spied on, confronts Wahlberg, there's about as much energy and involvement as yesterday's soggy lunch.

It wasn't bad, and the plot developed well with several nice twists and turns. However, Catherine Zeta-Jones seemed a needless add-on. The film could've been complete without her. Mark Wahlberg has developed into a fine, solid actor and he holds the film together. If you had to keep the volume down lower, Russell Crowe was nearly impossible to understand or hear, because his speaking voice is so low.

Every character has his flaws and his secrets.  The entire cast turned in outstanding performances, but Mark Wahlberg, Katherine Zeta-Jones and Russell Crowe were all at their best.

He's good and pure, while Crowe (hetero, part of the establishment) is evil. And the film being a modern ""film-noir"" masterpiece? Gimme a break.

It ended like a Perry Mason TV show, with little fanfare and the bad guy just gives up.  I always can tell when a movie is having trouble when the background music and sounds muffle the dialog.  Watch some Tarantino or Coen Brothers movies to see how dialog s/b handled.  Over all, it was an OK movie.  I probably wouldn't watch it again.

5565351,2,B00BAQZDU0,"Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors who have a career that feels smaller than it is, mainly because all of his film roles run together.  Whether he's playing another cop, or another criminal gone good, or another arrogant Bostonian, Wahlberg seems to regurgitate the same character over and over again, film to film.  The sad thing is that, for the most part, he chooses a slew of forgettable films to grace his familiar shtick with.

To tell you the truth, `Broken City' is no different.

Directed by Allen Hughes, one of the Hughes Brothers who made a name for themselves back in the early 90's, `Broken City' is your standard `bad cop gone good caught in a web of lies told by even badder (I know that's not a word) men in higher places' type stories; you know, the kind that Marky Mark has made a thousand times before (or so it would seem).  In this film you have him sparring off against Russell Crowe, who plays the mayor of New York who hires former cop Wahlberg to spy on his wife, who he claims is having an affair.  If you saw the trailers for the film then you basically know the whole story already.  Zeta-Jones (the wife) isn't really having an affair, but that is just a cover story told by Crowe, who is the real bad guy here.

Don't you hate it when trailers give away the whole plot?  This is one of those situations where I actually feel like the film itself may have been a better experience had the trailer left it at `Crowe thinks Zeta-Jones is having an affair' and cut out all the `but it's obvious that Wahlberg is being strung along and don't miss this shot of Crowe giving the camera a look that spells out the fact that he is a deceitful villain'.  I hate obviousness, and trailers cut like that take all the fun out of a film, especially since Crowe really doesn't play his part too obviously and actually strings us along rather well for the first half of the film.

I don't know what happened to Allen Hughes.  I mean, `Menace II Society' was one of those films that took me by complete surprise and wound up being one of the highlights of the 90's for me.  This just feels so pedestrian.  There is no spark here.  Nothing is thrilling and all of the high tension moments feel ripped from other films.  How many times is there going to be a late night car chase by the river?  Seriously?  I've seen that scene before, done much better in another Russell Crowe film.  Sadly, everything about this film feels borrowed and because of that I can't recommend it at all.  It is not a bad film, it just is so forgettable.  Even the political aspect of the film felt so apathetic.  At the end of it all there is nothing to care about here.

The acting is decent.  Wahlberg does what he does, which is the same thing he did in the last movie but we're used to it.  He is not a bad actor, he just has no range.  Zeta-Jones does nothing and pretty much could have been played by any actress.  Crowe is in fine form, but the character is such an empty shell that I wish he would have walked away from the film altogether.  He completely devours Wahlberg in their verbal sparring scenes, especially in the final one, but even that isn't enough to save the film.  The highlight here is easily Kyle Chandler, who makes so much out of a very small role.  His few scenes are the best in the film, and the naturalness is lends to his every word (that train scene is magnificent) makes for a very flowing presence.  I wanted to see more of him, but I really wouldn't have wanted him to play any other role than the one he played, since it was the best in the film.

I wish I could give this a higher grade, but a D is really all I can muster.",1376524800,2,3655,4.267441860465116

5565353,4,B00BAQZDU0,Typical for Wahlberg and I liked it.  Russell Crow played a really good Mayor.  Worth watching as it keeps to the end.,1376438400,,118,4.318181818181818
5565354,4,B00BAQZDU0,"The impressive cast of name actors Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mark Wahlberg, Barry Pepper and Kyle Chandler is what drew me in to checking out this movie on DVD. The story will grip you as it's a tale of political corruption but all the characters are not quiet what they appear to be which makes it all the more appealing.

The look, as explained on the excellent 30+ DVD extra is that classic film noir only on color stock. This to me gave it a far more grittier '70s feel to the setting of New York City. It works in many scenes especially the bar scenes. I didn't think it worked so much in others and I can't really put a finger on why.

That's the thing. This movie could have been great. Don't get me wrong it's very good but it's not a classic by any stretch. In a strange way I actually found two lesser female characters much more interesting than the leads. Walhberg's secretary/assistant played by Alona Tal was that sassy ""broad"" you see in the old film noirs but updated and came across as a real strong female presence in Wahlberg's life now as a private detective.

The other is Wahlberg's girlfriend in the movie played by Natalie Martinez nailed her part but she's gone halfway through the movie (no, she doesn't die so I haven't spoiled much).

The whole movie just seemed slightly off kilter and not in a good way. Also, I hate to say this but I felt Michael Beach as police commissioner incredibly hard to understand. He's a mumbler in this movie. Half the time I was having to turn up the volume to hear him say his lines. Very very odd because he plays a crucial role in the story.

To be blunt, Crowe also had the mumbles in some of his scenes. Maybe they should have hired a better sound editor or just told the actors to speak up.",1376438400,,1766,4.355623100303951

I found the movie pretty good overall, but lacked that little something that would've made it a way better movie. The story was interesting and it definitely not slow with the story/action, but it seemed like you kind of knew how the plot was going to play out the whole time. Definitely an interesting twist, but I hate to say it...there could've been a little more drama focused on the issue Mark Wahlberg's character was dealing with, because the ending seemed a little lack luster. Overall, good acting and story, but not one I would rewatch or buy for my collection.",1373241600,,746,4.374100719424461

Russell Crowe mumbled half his lines so I had to turn the volume up to hear him, then of course the next scene would start with some obnoxiously loud noise like sirens and I couldn't turn the volume down fast enough.  I don't understand why in this modern day the film industry won't do volume leveling so as not to totally frustrate their audience.  Louder isn't better, and straining to hear an actor mumble is ridiculous since in a theater I can't rewind and turn up the volume to understand what was said.  3 stars for average plot and bad sound editing.  Mind you, this had nothing to do with the quality of the sound delivered by Amazon, this was a problem with the actual sound editing when the film was made.

5565406,2,B00BAQZDU0,"The acting, lines, and setting were good, and Walburg played himself well -- as he does in every movie.  However, the writing and story themselves were pretty poor -- it was very liberal/politically correct, pushing political agendas and stereotyping characters along party lines. Hollywood is pretty far to the left, and in bed with both the Democrats and the gay agenda, so it's no surprise how they stick to demonizing the right, making the left out to be blameless heroes, and having good ol' Marky Mark drive the leftist propaganda home.  Basically, a bunch of gay and Democrat agit-prop staged as a movie.  If I had known it was basically a Democrat campaign video, I would have saved my money -- and you should, too.

Liberal themes:
* Characters promoting the gay agenda, and even inserting the tax-funded gay activist group HRC into the movie
* Stereotyping the ""conservative"" politician as bad -- corrupt, murderous, ""homophobic"" and deserving of having his wife cheat on him
* Stereotyping the liberal politicians as good, earnest and ""of the people""
* Rehashing the Obama campaign's taxation agenda in movie form",1372550400,2,1124,4.994652406417113

5565422,1,B00BAQZDU0,"We rented this movie from Amazon last night. We found the speech dialogue in many places to be garbled and unintelligible. We have a very good quality home theater system that we have fine tuned to emphasize movie speech dialogue intelligibility. This movie from Amazon was not available in Dolby surround sound nor was closed captioning available. I just cannot believe in this day and age that a recent movie release, such as this one isn't available in Dolby surround sound, which promotes clear speech dialogue through a home theater system's center speaker. These short comings of this movie from Amazon are ridiculous considering that Amazon charges a $4.99 rental price, the same price that you can rent an actual DVD copy of this movie, which would have most likely Dolby surround sound as well as closed captioning. Four of us watched this movie last night. Everybody was saying, ""I can't hear it, what did they say?, turn up the volume"". All, which of course seriously detracted from enjoying what was probably a good movie with decent acting performances from big name actors. It's a shame that their good work was mired with this problem.

We have also found unfortunately that most of the movies that we have rented and streamed from Amazon have had similar speech dialogue intelligibility problems. We have complained to Amazon about this problem several times in the past. Amazon has yet to do anything to solve this problem, just continue to raise rental prices. These ongoing problems have limited our movie rentals from Amazon. Instead we stream movies from Netflix (unlimited rentals for about $8.00 per month), which do not have these problems. What we don't understand is why Netflix has effectively addressed these issues and Amazon seemingly cannot or doesn't care to.",1372464000,,1791,5.010067114093959

fiction, civic corruption and political skulduggery.

Wahlberg plays an ex-NYPD cop turned private investigator who's hired
by the mayor (Crowe) to find out if his wife (Zeta-Jones) is fooling
around on him. But is there more to the case than meets the untrained
eye?

You know right off the bat that your script (in this case, by Brian
Tucker) is in trouble when the key point hinges on a real estate deal
so arcane and esoteric in its details that you would need to be a city
planner yourself to fully comprehend it.

Filled with characters, conflicts and conundrums we couldn't care less

I enjoy watching Wahlberg and Crowe both and, while it's not their best acting to date, they still turned in performances that were fun to watch.  Broken City is a mess; there is no question about that.  But if you're just looking for a good time, it's still a helluva lot better than a lot of other so-called ""thrillers"" out there.  Yes, it has serious plot flaws, but for me, they were not fatal.  I will watch it again, which is more than I can say for many other films I have recently watched.",1371340800,,675,4.2015503875969
5565455,2,B00BAQZDU0,"""Broken City"" is a movie where the trailers really made me want to see this movie in the theaters, but I never got around to it.

I picked the Blu-ray up on sale for 15 bucks or so at Target thinking that with the cast (despite some hit and miss movies, I've really come too like Mark Wahlerg and think he's a very capable actor, and Russell Crowe is usually pretty good) it had to be worth the price.  Truth be told, I wish I'd spent just the ten bucks in the theaters nstead of buying the movie for 15.

I went into this movie really wanting to like it, really believing that I would.  Is ""Broken City"" a bad movie? No?  But it's not a particularly good movie, either.  That's really the major problem.  There's absolutely nothing about the movie that differentiates itself from the hundreds of other movies just like it: crime dramas with a twist ending, someone gets double-crossed by someone they thought they could trust, one person thinks they hold the cards only to find out someone else is holding an even better hand.  It's a plot device that we see at least ten times a year in the theaters. And ""Broken City"" doesn't even feature any outstanding performances to make up for the over-used plot devices.

Heck, even if the movie were spectacularly bad, at least it would provide something worthy of conversation.  But all it is is just an OK popcorn flick...nothing more, nothing less.  Something to rent and pass a Saturday morning with. Just another movie on Russell Crowe's filmography.

This movie will be forgotten in a year, if not sooner.  If you must see it, rent it from the red-box.",1371254400,,1602,4.520833333333333

5565508,3,B00BAQZDU0,"Broken City (2013)

After all this time, I have to finally admit it: I like Mark Wahlberg. He's grown on me with each new role, even when the movies he's starring in aren't exactly masterpieces. He seems to have embraced the Tom Cruise mode of stardom where, while not stretching too far out of his comfort zone, he manages to play interesting variations on the same persona from movie to movie, and usually delivers an entertaining product. I've always loved Russell Crowe, a great actor who can either be subtle or chomp scenery like a champ (as he does here), and who can make even the lousiest movie he's in (think Man With the Iron Fists) into something at least watchable. It was on the strength of these two that I decided to watch Broken City, even though it didn't get the best reviews when it came out.

Wahlberg plays private investigator Billy Taggart, an ex-cop who was booted from the force in disgrace seven years prior for the questionable shooting of an accused rapist and murderer. Crowe plays Nicholas Hostetler, the wheeling and dealing mayor of New York City with whom Taggart has a bit of history. When the Mayor hires Billy during a re-election campaign to find the man with whom his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, Billy thinks it's a simple adultery case. But as is often the case in movies like these, nothing is what it seems as Taggart uncovers a web of lies involving not only adultery but political intrigue, murder and a shady land deal that may be tied to his own troubled past...

The problem with Broken City is that it isn't sure what to focus on. There are just too many running subplots stuffed into this 100-minute flick: one involving Billy's aspiring actress girlfriend (who also happens to be the sister of the victim of the criminal that Billy shot) who is excited about starring in her first indie film, one involving the Police Commissioner who has his own reasons for wanting to investigate the Mayor, one involving Billy's young assistant and the ""will-they-won't they"" dynamic they have, one with the Mayor's opponent Jack Valiant (played by Barry Pepper with a freakin' sweet mullet) and his campaign manager (Kyle Chandler), one with the dysfunctional relationship between a powerful land developer and his son, and so on and so on. It's too much. The movie just kind of lurches from plot to plot and as a result, none of them are particulary satisfying.

Then there are the little implausibilities which took me right out of the movie. Since there were a bunch of them and I've already written a lot here, I'll stick to three main examples: **SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**

-The hilariously abrupt breakup between Taggart and his girlfriend. Basically, the girl does a pretty graphic love scene in her movie and apparently didn't forewarn Billy about its intensity, so his simmering jealousy about the relationship between his girlfriend and her co-star boils over and Billy, a recovering alcoholic, starts getting trashed at the after-party. Then his girlfriend confronts him after watching him have three drinks and says that it's over, and the only thing tying them together is the memory of her dead sister, and blah blah blah. Then she disappears from the film, never to be seen again. This after we've just spent the previous 40 minutes watching them engage in a tender, mutually loving relationship. It felt like the writer was writing the script and thought, ""Oh well, time to move the story along, she hates him now!""

-At one point, Billy stakes out the Big Bad Corporation behind the shady land deal and sees a worker take a box of trash to the dumpster. He checks out the box and finds the ""smoking gun"": blueprints and projections for the planned real estate development in pristine condition. Not thirty seconds later, he looks in the office window and sees the office workers shredding every document, destroying all evidence of their misdeeds. WTF? Did this one guy just say, ""ah, the heck with it, it's my smoke break, no need to shred these""?

-Evidence of Billy's shooting the rapist emerges in the form of an old videotape taken at the scene. I'm sorry, a videotape?? Even if you take into account that the incident took place seven years before the film, that still only makes the year 2006! I was waiting for the mayor to break out the BetaMax next. (Though I must say, I did like the wrinkle it presented for Wahlberg's character; in the end, he can't take the mayor down without implicating himself.) **END SPOILERS**

Reading all that, it seems like I didn't like the movie all that much, but that's not exactly the case. I liked it well enough for what it was: a modestly entertaining, B-level time-waster with some decent acting. It's the kind of film that would have played well on a rainy Sunday afternoon on TNT in the late '90s. In fact, it did remind me strongly of another movie from that era, the somewhat forgotten City Hall (1996) with Al Pacino and John Cusack. Come to think of it, maybe you should watch that instead.

Picture quality on the Blu Ray was, as expected for a newer release, very good with lots of deep blacks and no noticeable artifacts. Sound quality was good, particularly during the handful of action scenes. No extras of note aside from the usual fluff.

2.5 of 5 stars, rounded up to 3.

Needless characters, the whole relationship with the girlfriend was pointless.  I know there is a connection but it seemed like filler. The gay relationship seemed to be thrown in there for no reason what so ever.  It had nothing to do with the plot.
The whole plot and build-up just kind of falls off. What Russell Crowe is hiding is not that monumental.  Yes it is illegal but I think it is something that goes on all the time and wasn't really that surprising.
The acting throughout was flat.
I would not recommend unless you have some time to waste on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1370476800,4,812,4.534246575342466

5565533,2,B00BAQZDU0,"Like many viewers, I was disappointed by this movie. It's hard not to have high expectations when both Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe are in the cast. Throw in Catherine Zeta Jones, and how can it not be great??? I wish I knew....but it wasn't great. It wasn't even very good.

The actors brought nothing new or engaging to their parts. They spoke their lines, yelled occasionally, and left us wanting more. The story was needlessly complex in places, with 6 or 8 different unfamiliar character names thrown at the audience in one or two sentences of dialog, and the entire middle portion of the movie dragged to the point of boredom.

The entire subplot involving Wahlberg's girlfriend added nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie, imagine for a moment how much better it would have been without the time wasted on this needless plot complication. The entire ""independent movie"" subplot was far-fetched and poorly rendered. Meanwhile, his relationship with his secretary was much more interesting and promising. I felt nothing for his girlfriend, while I really liked his secretary; and, to be honest, I found it unrealistic that he didn't share my feelings, at least until the end. Maybe his frequent (and tiresome) guzzling of booze after ""falling off the wagon"" dimmed his judgement.

Finally, a movie like this is only as good as its villain. A truly great villain can elevate a mundane production to a much higher plane; but in this case, I feel that Russell Crowe, one of the strongest, most dynamic, charismatic, and menacing characters to ever appear in cinema....simply didn't deliver. I don't place the blame for this failure entirely on him. Much of his strength was smothered in weird hairdo's, odd costumes, varying accents, and the phoniest spray-on tan this side of Dancing with the Stars. It was like watching Anthony Hopkins trying to play Hannibal Lecter in a tutu and clown shoes....no one could have pulled it off. The flawed script, weak dialog, and director's lack of vision simply would not allow it.

In conclusion, look at the analysis of ratings, with a large majority of viewers giving it 3 stars or less. This movie fell far short of both audience expectation and its own potential, and is not particularly enjoyable to watch, despite a great cast and interesting premise. BOTTOM LINE: Your viewing time can be better spent elsewhere.",1369958400,,2374,4.912718204488778
5565534,3,B00BAQZDU0,"I've become a fan of Mark Wahlberg over the years. It's fantastic that many have finally gotten past the whole Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch persona that could have been a career ender when it came to acting. The truth is that Wahlberg has shown he has the chops to perform in a dramatic role and make it truly believable. So going into BROKEN CITY I had high hopes.

The movie takes place in New York and opens with Wahlberg as Billy Taggert, a police detective who finds himself in the center of controversy after gunning down a supposed rapist in project area known as Bolton Village. While asked to step down by his superior Taggert is praised by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe). Even though he leaves the force, the mayor makes sure to let him know he'll keep an eye out for him.

Fast forward seven years later and Taggert is now a private eye with a ton of bills and clients who more often ask for leniency than pay their debt to him. Then one day he gets a call from the mayor to come see him. Hostetler hires Taggert to follow his wife and get any information on her that he can. Is she cheating on him or is something else going on? The mayor isn't saying but Taggert can't refuse the money he's paying him and begins surveillance.

But that surveillance leads to something else going on that is far beyond a simple fling for the mayor's wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The man she meets is tied into the mayoral campaign of Hostetler's main opponent. When that same man is murdered after Taggert passes along the information to Hostetler the entire concept of the film changes from a simple wife having an affair to the complications that go on in an election year.

Along the way we are shown that Taggert has been dating the sister of the woman who was raped by the man he killed in the movie's opening. But things don't go well with the two of them and that portion of the film seems wasted. Another reference to the past isn't though as the mayor holds something over Taggert's head, a piece of hidden evidence that he is using to force Taggert to stick with his plans and follow instructions. Only an honest man could find a way to cut through this and take on the most powerful man in New York.

The cut throat world of behind the scenes back stabbing and manipulation take the forefront in this story and Taggert's decision to either go with the flow or stand up for what is right are found at center stage before the film ends. With so much on the line and with the murder of an innocent man resting on his conscious just what he will do is pretty much a given but then some movies have taken the opposite direction you expect.

So with all this star power as well as the direction of Allen Hughes, half of the brother duo behind hits like THE BOOK OF ELI and FROM HELL, why is it that this movie didn't pull me in and hold me there? Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining film that delivers the goods, but it just doesn't have that oomph feeling that one would expect with the pedigree involved.

Both Wahlberg and Crowe seem to be walking through their roles without putting something new into them. These characters as portrayed by these actors feel like we've seen them before. Nothing new is added. Sure they do a great job but as a viewer I expect more from an actor than simply sleep walking through a role. Zeta-Jones is wasted in a part that offers her little. That could be a blessing seeing what the others did with their parts.

The movie also has a predictable feel to it, like we know what's coming long before the characters involved do. That may be because films with a story like this have been done before and this one adds little to make it different than the rest. As I stated earlier, this doesn't make it a bad film, it just makes it feel like been there, done that. For Wahlberg and Crowe fans you won't be disappointed. For the rest go in with low expectations and the movie will no doubt satisfy.",1369958400,,3950,4.357336956521739

5565550,3,B00BAQZDU0,"Broken city is a movie about ex-cop Billy Taggart (Walhberg)seeking redemption and revenge after being double-crossed and then framed by its most powerful figure Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Crowe).

Both Walhberg and Crowe play solid roles with Walhberg especially comfortable playing the cop type role, which is something we have seen from him before.

The movie itself is entertaining, although a bit slow at times, but brings nothing to the table that surprises or brings  some dramatic twist.  There are times that the plot drags a bit and opens plot lines that are never really answered (i.e, Taggart's girlfriend issues) but its biggest issue is that it doesn't bring anything new and retreads some basic plots that have been done before and better.

Sure, the testosterone overflows, but Crowe and Wahlberg have both been much worse.  One thing I could have done without is Wahlberg's scenes as a drunk.  Not convincing.

Taggart was kicked off the force for shooting and killing a rapist/murderer who was turned loose by the courts.  The victim's sister Natalie (Natalie Martinez) becomes Billy's girlfriend but inexplicably departs midway through the movie.  It's like the filmmaker's just decided to change plots.  Taggart is hired by the mayor to follow his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is suspected of having an affair.  Alas, there is more to her activities than sex.

She has the goods on her hubby and would love nothing better than for him to be defeated in the soon to be held election.

5565626,2,B00BAQZDU0,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Broken City, for me, is one of those films that knows where it wants to go, but the execution is underwhelming. You have big names Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe together in a political cop-drama and that should be a recipe for success, but somewhere along the line things fell out of place and what we're left with is Broken City. A film that attempts to be more complex than it needs to be and, ultimately, more complex than it can handle.

Broken City starts with NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) killing Mikey Tavarez, a man accused of raping and killing the sixteen year old sister of Billy's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). After getting arrested and going to court, the verdict was that Billy killed Mikey in self-defense so he couldn't be charged with manslaughter. However, he was forced to quit the force.

Seven years later we find a near-bankrupt Billy who's now a private detective. Then one day he gets a call from Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Crowe) who was responsible for getting rid of Billy's convicting evidence seven years ago. Hostetler is convinced that his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, so he wants Billy to find out who she's seeing behind his back. Billy finds out that she's seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler). Andrews is the campaign manager for Hostetler's election rival Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), a man who's doing everything in his power to prove that Hostetler is as crooked as they come.

Now I'll stop it there, but judging from that brief summary it's safe to say that this sounds like a pretty entertaining movie, right? Maybe a little clichd, but one that could still be enjoyable if done right. Unfortunately that's not the case because as soon as we find out that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews the entire thing gets out of control and before you know it everyone and their mother is involved in some convoluted scheme to bring down Hostetler. If you ask me the movie derails about halfway through because once you reach that 50 minute mark that's when it started to get bad.

What turned me off even more is that there's not one interesting character in here. Scratch that, I loved Billy's assistant Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal). Unfortunately, her role is as minor as they come so it's not like she has enough time to save this train wreck. Billy struck me as an annoying ass who didn't know how to handle things like an adult and Hostetler was your cookie-cutter crooked politician. There's just an extreme lack of creativity in the character department because it feels like we've seen all these characters before in other films of this genre.

Honestly, the only positive thing I can say about the film is that everyone involved did solid job. Wahlberg gave another Wahlberg performance. So if you're not a fan of his don't expect to have your opinion swayed with this film. Zeta-Jones gave a nice performance, but she doesn't get a lot of screen time. Crowe gave an enjoyable performance as well, but was crippled by the generic-ness of his character. This was my first time seeing Alona Tal in a film, but I really liked what I saw. Then again, I think part of that had to do with the fact that she was the only cast member with an interesting character.

Overall Score: 4.5/10 - My biggest problem with this film is that it lacks anything unique. We've seen these scenarios before and almost all of them have been done better. Then it suffers from a second half that lacks any sort of cohesiveness which makes it feel like a punishment to get through the entire thing. I would have a hard time recommending this to anyone, but if you're really itching to see it I would suggest a rental or Netflix if they have it.",1368576000,,3762,4.699544764795144

Parts did not make sense. Why get a detective to check on a wife committing infidelity that may have dramatic effect on an election a few days away? If it has not come out it probably would be better to leave it till after the election. A detective that did an amateurish job of trailing someone secretly.

Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-cop turned Private Detective after leaving the force because the Mayor helped him out of a jam.

Lots of violence, guns, harsh words, drinking, either The Mayor or Whalberg are always downing the whiskey. The mayor hires Whalberg to find out who his wife is having an affair with. But that is just the beginning of this con game. Not all or much is what it seems and Whalberg finally figures it out.

What kept me interested in this film was trying to figure out if Russell Crowe was wearing a wig. Yes, a partial wig, pretty good one, but not good enough. The wig looked silly on Crowe, not natural. Other than that, the plot has been seen thousands of times, different actors,,different places. But, this one only kept my interest for a short period of time.

However, the day after I found myself thinking ""It's really not that good...""  Some of the plot seems contrived, much of Crowe's dialogue is muddled and hard to understand, and the movie's big twist leaves a bitter taste.

I will say this plus to the blu ray/DVD combo.  At least the blu ray had some extras.  I was not expecting that since the film was not successful at the box office or with critics.

You could not follow the story.  Yes, surprises BUT they have to make sense.

Did we really need to follow Wahlberg's personal life with the girlfriend/wife, whoever she was.  Made no sense and was unnecessary.

5565716,4,B00BAQZDU0,"For those who remember how tightly written and brilliantly acted television's BOSS pushed the covers back on Chicago's gamey political tales the perhaps BROKEN CITY will be a disappointment.  As written by Brian Tucker and directed by Allen Hughes this film comes off as a bit disjointed with some very confusing story developments that are so mumbled by the cast that subtitles might be necessary to stay involved.  But do we want to be involved in a story where every character is crooked? Usually there is at least one redeeming force that makes the light shining on all the evil around seem justified, but not here: everyone involved is essentially a bad guy.

NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who raped and murdered the sixteen-year-old sister of Taggart's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). His friend, Captain Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) asks Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for help, and Hostetler eliminates the evidence against Taggart. Tavarez's death is ruled as self-defense, and Taggart is forced to leave the police. Seven years later, Taggart is a private detective on the verge of bankruptcy when he's hired by Hostetler to find out who his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair with. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Ta, the one bright light in the film), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). But even that is a sham and a mistake that drives everyone into even deeper depths of evil.  Even our given hero Billy Taggart returns of his alcohol abuse and despite his efforts to make things right meets all manner of surprise changes that simply don't hang together.

The cast of fine actors do the best they can with this creaky story and in addition to the stars mentioned, the smaller roles are well filled by Michael Beach, James Ransome and Griffin Dunne. The film is dark, tosses in the usual car chases, and in general entertains but leaves a bitter aftertaste about American politics. Grady Harp, May 13",1367366400,,2180,5.078212290502793

Plus with Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Marky Mark also in the cast ... it had to be pretty good.  Right?

Well ... not so fast.  Out of all of Kyle Chandler's released, post FNLs films (Super 8, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty), this one isn't in the same league as the others.  It starts off at a good pace, a good reveal, but it quickly loses its way all the way through to its less than satisfying end.

This is a corruption drama. Mark Wahlberg plays a former cop turned private investigator hired by the Mayor of New York City (Crowe) to investigate the mayor's cheating wife (Zeta-Jones). It's a pretty standard story set against the backdrop of a mayoral race. It proceeds as you would expect - there are very few twists and turns in this paint by the numbers mystery. That said, is it a bad film? No. It's worth watching once - that said, I don't think this is a must have.
