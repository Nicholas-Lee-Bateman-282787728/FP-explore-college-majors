8535788,4,B0094AH3PM,"A fine and convincing performance. The stage directors (Karl-Ernst & Ursel Herrmann) should be congratuladed for managing to set this opera on such a small stage. One really feels ""at home"" in this setting. Svetla Vassileva (Violetta) both sings and acts well. Massimo Giordano (Alfredo) is not bad, but at times his voice sounds a little strained. Vladimir Stoyanov (Giorgio) has a fine voice, but acts without affection. The sound is a bit tinny and detract from the overall experience.

Being Verdi's most performed opera, the competition is strong from other video performances. Of recent versions, the setting from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Scala-featuring-Gheorghiu-and-Vargas/dp/B00FUBCJKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Scala featuring Gheorghiu and Vargas</a>&nbsp;is most recommendable.

8535789,5,B0094AH3PM,"A very good La Traviata, this production is quite small as it was performed in a smaller opera house. However, this makes the performance much more intimate. The sound could be better, but the voices shine, and there are times where they are drowned out. The production itself is a bit on the darker side, but nonetheless realistic because of the performances.

Svetla Vassileva makes a fantastic Violetta, her portrayal is a bit spicier than most, and feels almost a bit like Carmen at times with her split purple dress and fishnets, but given the more modern setting of this production, it really suits it. Her voice is strong, and she has a stage presence like no other. Not only that, this woman can act, she has you by the strings the first 3 quarters of it, and once her final scene is in place, it tears you down. I have never seen a more tragic portrayal than this woman, especially in a modern production. She puts a lot of expression into her performance, not only in the vocals, but in her acting as well, her eyes truly cut into you.

The other characters are very good too, I will leave this part short, because Violetta truly stole the show.

To put it bluntly, I have never heard or seen a Traviata that made me cry (feel, yes, but cry... no). Get it! This production is quite incredible.",1421712000,,1303,4.466386554621849
8535790,4,B0094AH3PM,"This Parma 2007 production is by Mr. and Mrs. Karl-Ernst and Ursel Herrmann, who are among the founding fathers of the German regietheater. The German Directors conceived it in the early `90s but this is their first work in Italy. The set and costumes (also by Karl-Ernst Herrmann) are traditional, and their approach to the drama is now becoming traditional, in that other directors borrow from their ideas and their depiction of Violetta.

The action takes place in mid-nineteenth-century Paris, planted firmly in the hedonistic demimonde, with its gambling, high spending and sexual promiscuity. Act I takes place in a richly upholstered dinning room with a domed ceiling and a rich chandelier. During the prelude there are six men in the room. Violetta is lying on the dinning room table, her beautiful legs in black stockings, caressed by two men, dancing with a third, etc. Once one of them leaves money bills on the fireplace mantle for services rendered you realize that they are all her clients (in various combinations). She uses one of the bills to light up her cigarette and throws the rest of the bills into the fire.

This is just the prelude. I'll try to describe what happens just until the brindisi. The introduzione section starts with the guests bursting in: they seem like ballet dancers forced to moonlight as sex workers, accompanied by their shady patrons. When Alfredo is introduced he offers Violetta a...pot of flowers, a very strange choice as the Baron presents her with an expensive diamond necklace. So we get a first clue about Alfredo's navet, romanticism and immaturity. There are a dozen interactions and subplots unfolding between the guests. The girls giggle loudly; everyone is quite boisterous (all these extraneous sounds are superimposed on the music). Suddenly eight waiters appear in a back foyer, arranged in two rows, carrying trays with food festooned with sparklers. This business elicits more cheerful din. The guests are seated; Gastone constantly provokes the Baron who has to give up his seat next to Violetta to Alfredo. When Gastone offers the brindisi to the Baron,he plucks out a bouquet from the latter's suit. The music stops. The Baron takes back the bouquet, can't make up his mind, and then throws it to the floor and storms out: loud cheering. Two waiters carry Alfredo on their shoulders, and a dozen more tiny dramas unfold in the few seconds before we get to the brindisi. Violetta sings it standing on the table. She shows off her legs, starts a striptease, and throws off her garters to the guests. One of them fondles her leg; another gives her money bills that she shows everyone and then throws them around. The guests quickly stand up and form two camps on both sides of the table, some girls expose their legs as if they are about to dance cancan---OK, I think you get it. I needed to rewind the disc several times on that scene just to get all the details. It would take me a year to note and appreciate every idea, psychological insight, stage business, extraneous noise and detail the directors embellish the drama with. They clearly worked very closely with the entire cast, including the chorus, to flesh out the story as they wanted to present it. The acting of everyone is quite impressive. Every moment is very carefully shaped dramatically. It's up to you to decide whether all these details overwhelm the drama or clarify it.

And so I was going to trash this production. I wouldn't have bothered to give it a second spin if not for this review, but to get all the details I had to rewind every scene again and again. I appreciated details I did not notice and my reaction to the production gradually evolved and eventually made a complete U-turn from contempt to admiration.

Act II scene I (in Violetta's country house) is powerful and heartbreaking. One example: Alfredo's character is fully portrayed here. He is impulsive, immature, unpredictable, unstable and possibly a little crazy. While Germont pre sings ""Di Provenza"", his son slowly collapses and then regresses until he lies on the floor in a fetal position. When his father tries to prop him up you can see the insane rage and despair on Alfredo's face. Flora's party has its share of surprises. Gatone sings part of the matadors' chorus as a drag queen. Since he sings like a character tenor in a high-pitched voice the result is perverse. There is a topless dancer, someone in a lobster mask, the croupier is cheerfully dealing bad cards and two-dozen other ideas. But the interaction between the protagonists is very strong psychologically; the drama is cutthroat vivid. Violetta sings ""Alfredo, Alfredo, di questo core non puoi comprendere tutto l'amore"" as if her will to live is sucked out of her. She is lying on the floor face down, singing into the floor. The effect is so sad that Alfredo is visibly shocked and devastated. Act III is even more even depressing than usual; there is hardly a gleam of hope. Alfredo comes in with a large bouquet, which he drops to the floor as soon as he sees Violetta. They sing ""Parigi, o cara"" with their backs to each other, unable to look each other in the eye - they both know this is the end.

The singers would not be my first or second choice for their roles (in a traditional production), but it's fair to say that they acquit themselves quite well in this production. Neither Vassileva nor Giordano have the sweetest timbre, but their voices are just ideal for this production. Vassileva has a dark voice with a strong center and she overcomes all the technical challenges of the role (yes, she caps ""Sempre Libera"" with a high Eb).I heard Giordano's Alfredo at the MET a year later and thought his raw, bright and open sound made Alfredo sound eager and impulsive, but he may have had his Alfredo burnt into him in this production. His phrasing lacks style or elegance but that suits this Alfredo just perfectly. The best of the three is Stoyanov's Germont pre: a sizable voice, whose colors change with the context, a refined delivery with a beautiful, firm, secure line. The conductor decided to keep the standard cuts that were used in this production before it arrived to Parma. This is definitely a blu-ray I will play again and again despite, and even because of the imperfect singing.

Video and sound are good, but the camera sometimes can't catch up with everything that's going on simultaneously in multiple spots (during the parties), and that on a small stage! Tiziano Mancini's video direction became more sophisticated in the following years (and he also had more sophisticated toys to play with). The sound engineers are the same fine team from later productions (Paolo Berti, Michele Ruggiero, Alessandro Marsico). The sound is not without subtle problems - I moved a more detailed evaluation of the sound to the comment section.",1363564800,8,6843,4.8294970161977835
