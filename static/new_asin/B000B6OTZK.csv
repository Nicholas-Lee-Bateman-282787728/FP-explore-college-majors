8082583,5,B000B6OTZK,"A logical and solid approach to building jazz piano voicings that can be used in many popular songs. Based on a concept called Open Position Chord Voicings, you learn how to build these chords from a lead sheet using the melody, root, 7th and 3rd. Gradual;y, in later levels 5ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths are introduced as well as substitution and chromatic chords. The goal is that you ultimately develop a vocabulary of chords whose positions you memorize and can recall as easily as sight-reading notes. You will be able to apply this technique to other pop and jazz standards allowing you to fluently play your favorite songs from a fakebook.",1436745600,,645,4.81981981981982
8082584,5,B000B6OTZK,"Having taken more jazz piano lessons than I can count and causing the eyeballs of my piano teachers to roll back into their heads as I made the same mistakes again and again, this course by Bill Susman is jazz piano-learning-heaven for me.

I can play the same measure 100 times again and again and Bill Susman on the DVD doesn't groan or look at his watch or beg me to find another teacher.

Because I'm not as advanced yet as the other reviewer who wants to play all the special riffs that is heard in the demo, this course still allowed me to learn Manha De Carnaval at the simplest level 1 and then levels 2 and 3--and I not only sound good but I understand what I'm playing.

The course uses a unique method of repeating the lesson automatically until you are ready to start a new lesson.  In so doing, you find yourself playing the measures of the lesson again and again, following Bill's hands, until you surprise yourself that you can play the entire measure exactly and competently.

The sheer repetition causes memorization to happen without you forcing yourself to memorize the chords; but it is not boring.  Because you only keep repeating until you have the chords down pat.  Then you move on.

I have never seen another video or dvd based course that automatically repeats the lesson on screen--this subtly encouraging you to try again and again.

After 3 days of doing this course, I played the entire jazz piece--albeit, haltingly--but i played it and I understood what I was playing.  I have since played the song at speed and am very impressed with Susman's technique that helped me do this (and my ability to show off my jazz playing for my husband).

What surprised me most was that I picked up a general jazz fake book and was able to play some simpler jazz tunes in the book without a guided lesson.  The jazz chord techniques that Bill Susman teaches in Manha de Carnaval work for all jazz fake books.

I have given this course as a gift to 5 other friends who also have been frustrated in learning jazz piano; and to some friends who are current jazz piano teachers.  They have then had their own students buy the course to supplement their private classes.

I was also impressed by personal answers I received when I put in questions on their website ([...]  I wanted to know the theory behind some of the chords used in Manha De Carnival and got an immediate and comprehensive response from the author, Bill Susman.

It doesn't get much better than this for me for $19.95.",1135209600,10,2498,4.515555555555555
8082585,4,B000B6OTZK,"This is a very good and clear presentation of how to develop jazz chords from a lead sheet.  Susman goes through each measure of the piece on three levels.  The progression is excellent, as each level is slightly more complicated than the previous, and it is very clearly presented on the DVD.  I really like this measure by measure, go at your own pace approach.  I also like the explanations of  how the various chords are built.  For me this DVD was definitely worth the money.

Susman goes through all the measures of each line and then he plays the line in its entirety.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that sometimes he would come up with different fingering playing the whole line than he did for the individual measures, which was sometimes confusing.  Also, when he plays the song in its entirety, stylistically, he uses some very attractive runs and riffs that sounds very professional.  I would very much like to learn these, but there is no sheet music for the runs he is playing and there is no explanation of them on the DVD.  I would have gladly paid more for them, or even bought them separately as an add-on, but they are not offered.  Normally I wouldn't be  upset about this point because I can appreciate a performing artist not wanting to give away his signature runs.  However, the major selling line for the DVD is  ""Play Like Me.""",1132099200,7,1371,4.516260162601626
