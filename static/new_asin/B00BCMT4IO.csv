8566163,4,B00BCMT4IO,a dark film. I know Finland really isn't like this,1412985600,,50,4.1
8566164,5,B00BCMT4IO,"I ordered ""Priest of Evil"" after seeing Peter Franzen in ""Ambush"", where he was fantastic.
He certainly did not disappoint in this either. ""Priest of evil"" is a thriller and the movie really keeps you hooked every minute. This movie is in Finnish (not Danish as written in product details ) but with English text. I will highly recommend.",1410307200,,338,4.745762711864407
