But I do think it's what decided me to major in French, back when I first saw it at age 16.
And it still makes me giggle.",1233446400,,138,3.6333333333333333
686384,4,6303593380,It took me years to get a copy of this movie and was well worth the time and energy. Thanks to Amazon and their contacts!!!,1231200000,2,123,3.96
686385,5,6303593380,"This comedy/mystery is simply delightful. You can call it a masterpiece of its genre(s) or you can just enjoy its great timing, hilarious physical comedy, its story that involves spies, murders, and a sexy blonde (Mireille Darc) in a dress you have to see to believe. Pierre Richar is excellent as the blond man of the title who one day became a ""person of great interest"" for two rival departments in the French secret service. As we know, it is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room especially if the cat is not in the room and that's what the experienced employees of the secret service try to do - to find the sense in the routine activities of a man they are convinced is an important spy and who is in reality an absent-minded and oblivious violinist and the object of the practical jokes by his fellow musicians.

If it is not enough, there is a soundtrack written by Vladimir Cosma and performed by the King of Pan Flute, a famous Romanian musician Gheorghe Zamfir. Cosma recalls that when he was composing the music for The Tall Blond Man, he was thinking of the movie ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" and he wanted to use the elements of the Eastern European music. His idea to use the themes of Romanian doinas played by Zamfir was a stroke of genius. Once you hear the melodies, you won't be able to forget them.

5 to the movie and 5+ to the soundtrack",1166486400,18,1380,4.344961240310077
686386,1,6303593380,"After years of trying to get a copy of this wonderful movie and checking on Amazon, suddenly it became available on VHS at Amazon last summer and I ordered a copy. What arrived, is NOT an original studio release. Instead it was a generic tape with a typed white label. When I put it in to view, what I found was a very grainy image with a dubbed English soundtrack. I was very disappointed.

My guess is that someone found a copy of the 1972 poor U.S. release at a flea market somewhere and has taken a position that the copyright has entered the public domain after 28 years as per statutory section 17 USC 303 of the copyright law and is publishing copies of that worn out flea market copy.",1103673600,35,692,4.282442748091603

My first copy was loaned to a friend, who loaned it to a friend, who circulated it among all their family and friends, who have passed it on out of my reckoning.

686388,5,6303593380,"This is one great, classic, comedy! When it was released in 1973 it became such a hit in France that it was quickly released internationally, where it became a major hit in the US as well. The story of an unwitting schnook who is thought to be a superspy by warring factions of the French secret service provides ample fodder for farce, both slapstick and otherwise. This original version is MUCH better than the American remake starring Tom Hanks and Tom Arnold, and the casting is so perfect as to take your breath away. Among other things, I defy any male with a pulse to keep his jaw in place when the stunningly beautiful Mireille Darc (later to be Alain Delon's girlfriend) turns around in a certain black dress [grin].
For trivia buffs, it is interesting to note a few facts such as (1) the part of the conductor during the concert scene was a cameo by the director, Yves Robert; (2) the score was one of the first showcases for the pan-flute music of Zamphir; and (3) the film was such a hit that it spawned an immediate sequel (The Return of the Tall Blond Man).",1030838400,16,1071,4.441624365482234
686389,5,6303593380,"Robert's comedy equals the best in the farce and satire. The script is well honed, and the direction is is sharp and subtle -not a wasted moment.

686469,5,6303593380,"Great, funny,  story.  This was the 1972 movie from which 'The Man with one red shoe' (1985) with Tom Hanks was based.  The storyline is much the same.  However, it IS only in French, and there are no English subtitles available (sigh).  BUT - the story is SO visual - you can easily follow the plot.  There was also a sequel to this - ""The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe"" also in French.  Often sold together.

This was a great product, ran easily on my computer - no issues with Regions.

686473,5,6303593380,"I'm not going to bother talking about the movie.  If you're familiar with it, you probably love it.  I first saw it in the '80s on VHS, and I still have the tape though I lusted for a DVD version.  Fortunately my wife bought one for me for Christmas, and equally fortunately she really combed the reviews before buying the Russian release.

GET THE RUSSIAN RELEASE!  Yeah, sure, most of us don't read Russian, but it doesn't matter!  Once you get to the menus, the first option is Play, so just press Select or Play on your remote.  And by default it comes up in French soundtrack with English subtitles.  And it is a BEAUTIFUL transfer!  We finally bought a 1080p TV last year (after a tree was blown through our roof from a lightning strike which blowed up my old 26"" Panasonic) and it is an absolutely gorgeous transfer.  It kinda blew my mind that a 40 year old film could look so good at high-def.  It is also rather timeless, though I imagine Paris traffic is somewhat heavier these days.

Absolutely worth the money, now if I could find Return also done by the Russians....",1395532800,2,1080,4.426395939086294

USA.  There were no warnings on the site to advise me, or any one else for that matter, about this situation.  It's basically a loss, and I don't want to take the time to deal with it.

I would advise anyone buying through this seller to be very cautious about buying films that are done outside the USA,  as they might run into a similar problem.

I suppose a person could have a dedicated computer to play films from other countries....but I am not up to that whole process and expense.  Pity ....I have heard that this is a terrific film, one I'm sure I would have enjoyed.  IF...IF, only it would have played

While the film story is a rather dated farcical treatment of Cold War intrigue, it was fresh when it came out and would be enjoyable still.  It certainly deserves a more professional format than this.

Love the movie, disgusted at the production values of this DVD copy.",1371513600,4,428,4.916666666666667

686628,5,6303593380,"I saw this movie in a theater when it first came out in the 1970s.  I laughed so hard my sides hurt.  It was the funniest movie I had seen to that time (and it has *THAT* dress).  I went back and saw it a second time with my college dorm room mate and my girlfriend (who is now my wife of 33 years).  It was my introduction to the genre of French farces.

Years later, I started buying DVDs of old films I loved, especially French farces.  No collection of French Farces would be complete without this film.  But this film was particularly difficult to locate.  Finally I found it on Amazon, the original French film with English subtitles, just like I'd seen in college, but with Russian DVD menus and extras.  Fortunately for me, I studied Russian in school too!  So, this DVD was made for me.

The good news: you don't need to know any Russian to enjoy this DVD.  Let's face it, a monkey could navigate DVD menus to find ""play"".  The only ""extra"" you'll miss is a filmography of Pierre Richard entirely in Russian (Cyrillic) text (no pictures - not too exciting).

I highly recommend this DVD.  You won't find it on NetFlix.",1267920000,9,1127,4.350961538461538

686631,4,6303593380,"I've loved this classic French farce forever and was very pleased to finally find it on DVD.
The VHS dubs previously available were very low quality, with enough sections missing, mis-matched color, bad English dubbing, and awful sound quality to genuinely distract from the movie.
  This DVD is a BIG improvement, though not without its defects. The DVD's label and packaging are amateurish. The English dubbing is still distracting and given that it is a DVD I assumed that it would have both French and English audio tracks, but it does not. This DVD has not been ""restored"" (the listing did not suggest that it had been) and damage to the original film from which it was made is considerable. I believe the audio quality of the original film was poor even by 1972 standards. No Dolby surround-sound here.

But having said all that this is a hysterically funny film and this DVD is good enough to make a pleasure to watch. Of course, I am not talking about clever intellectual repartee here. This is not Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. This is a French Farce! More in the line of The Marx Brothers. If you like your humor broad, this is for you.

  In 1972 spy fantasies like James Bond were all the rage and Le Gran Blonde plays on the popularity of these ""spy movies"", but the title character is not a spy, he is an innocent violinist unknowingly being used by spies as bait in an internal rivalry.

This film is simultaneously clever and low-brow, sophisticated and crass, sometimes subtle and sometimes as direct as a cream pie in the face. You are unlikely to ever again be this stunned by a dress, laugh this hard over a trip to the bathroom, or snicker so much while watching someone serve coffee.

But here is my review of the 2015 RESTORED VERSION. I hope this is helpful.

Honestly, it's been well over 40 years since I saw this 1972 offbeat French comedy but I remembered how much I liked it then and I loved it just as much this time around. This was the period when everyone was making spy films and satires on them. The plot is inane - it's not a spoiler to tell you this much. A drug dealer is trying to get his competitors (or is it the police - I don't know and it doesn't matter) off his trail. So he tells them he will be the 9:30 plane at the airport. He then has one of his henchmen pick an average guy getting off the plane and pretend that HE is the smuggler. He picks out the mild violinist and from then on everyone chase him. (He has no clue!), the real centerpiece of the 90-minute film is the seduction scene with GORGEOUS and SEXY Mirelle Darc. That alone is worth the price of admission.

I saw a bunch of reviews of this film here on Amazon and all talk about the quality of the print. This is a BEAUTIFUL RESTORED print being issued by Film Movement  as part of a new line of Film Moment Classics. It's great!

The only extras are the trailer - and a few other trailers. But there's also a 12 page booklet with a 5-page essay and a full page color photo of Ms. Darc (in THAT backless dress!).

If you remember the film, you'll want to see it again. If you like slapstick comedy (think Peter Sellers in ""The Pink Panther""), I think you'll like this one.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
