3445257,5,B001A33ZIK,"My daughter and I had watched and thoroughly enjoyed the original showing;
Dick Francis remains one of our favorites authors.  We then later shared the
cost and the viewing of the videos. This order replaces our tapes and
provides a Christmas gift for her.",1350518400,,256,4.818181818181818
3445258,4,B001A33ZIK,"Very good plot and well done for the 1970s. Now (at this review date) sells used at 75% orig retail. Cheaper than rental/streaming per episode. The 6 episodes do have a 70s look, quite nostalgic. The main downfall is some difficulty catching all the accent dialogue as this DVD set was produced before this distributor began putting subtitles on all their products. But it is a DVD set, so you can stop, reverse, and listen again, if needed. It's PBS Mystery!

An ex-race jockey takes a fall and gets his hand trampled. It's crushed beyond use. This just after his wife walked out. with racing no longer an option he puts his efforts toward solving crime as a Private Investigator around the race course. Halley (Mike Gwilym) bets on plenty of horsing around to fill his days. Based on stories by real jockey and author Dick Francis. PI sidekick is Barnes (Mick Ford) and there are a number of guest stars.

Episodes average 51 minutes each:
1 ODDS AGAINST
A takeover attempt on a race course needs uncovered to save the track. It's the duo's 1st PI case, hired by Halley's father-in-law.

2 TRACK DOWN
Halley loses his bet and is sure a race was thrown. Even more is uncovered as Halley learns to use his new bionic arm and hand. Short flash of nudity.

3 GAMBLING LADY
A horse put down after accidentally being hit by a milk tanker. Halley & Barnes are hired to check out insurance fraud. Halley reconnects with wife Jenny (Susan Wooldridge).

4 HORSES FOR COURSES
A tip on a long shot--a win--then a very poor bookie. Needs investigating and then gets deadly.

5 HORSENAP
A kidnapped horse puts the Pvt. Eye Duo on the trail of Leapy lad. Why no ransom demand?

6 NEEDLE
Winner horses running badly. Can Halley connect syringes with performance?

Expect a bit of language and criminal violence along the way, and plenty of beautiful horses.",1338076800,3,1843,4.631901840490798

3445260,5,B001A33ZIK,"I am a big fan of Dick Francis' books.  I started reading them over 20 years ago and now listen to the audio version on my iPod.  When I discovered that there were British TV shows based on Dick's books, I could not wait to get a hold of them.  This purchase came in advance of the delivery date and was in excellent condition.  For what they charged, it was a great purchase.",1316304000,2,376,4.109589041095891
3445261,4,B001A33ZIK,I loved the characters and story.  It was put onto film nicely from the book.,1247443200,2,77,4.133333333333334
3445262,4,B001A33ZIK,"As a long-time devoted fan of the complicated Dick Francis books, I was hesitant to try a TV version of the stories, wondering how any of his  stories could be condensed into an hour. I need not have worried, the stories are up to standard and the Halley character with his ""bionic hand"" is well done and believable.
Well worth the purchase!",1239667200,10,341,4.5
3445263,3,B001A33ZIK,"Fairly well done adaption of the novels.  Production values only fair, but a gritty portrayal.  Worth watching if you are a Dick Francis fan.",1231632000,5,141,4.833333333333333
3445264,5,B001A33ZIK,"Loved this series.  Very true to the Dick Francis Mysteries that featured Sid Halley.  I've seen the other ""movies"" that were based on Dick Frances works and they were horrible.  Barely recognizable as being based on his books.  Watching this series was pure pleasure.  Well written and well acted.  Sure wish there were more!",1224028800,16,326,4.944444444444445

I just couldn't come to like the star, the Welsh actor, Mike Gwilym; although he did a fair job here and is a fine Shakespearean actor.  Even though this is not one of the best, it's worth watching for the stories.",1428969600,,268,4.448979591836735

8275799,5,B001A33ZIK,"Love love love Dick Francis books, was so excited to find these shows converted to DVD;

I read another review that said the picture quality wasn't so great, but we had no problem. Considering its conversion from 1970s TV to DVD, we thought it was excellent.

The shows themselves are gripping, too short by a mile, just like the books.",1372723200,,336,4.583333333333333
8275800,5,B001A33ZIK,"These were basically enjoyable. I've always wondered why they didn't make movies from Mr. Francis' books, and here they are. His books are longer, of course, but these vignettes are still enjoyable.",1372204800,,198,5.21875
8275801,5,B001A33ZIK,"When this set came out years ago, I got it right away because I fondly remembered this mystery from PBS.  I have rewatched over the years, but the quality was very, very poor.  I saw that this was reissued by a new owner, so purched the set again.  What a difference!  Good quality and sound.  A real pleasure to rewatch now.  You will not be sorry you purchased this much loved mystery series!",1362096000,4,394,4.328767123287672
