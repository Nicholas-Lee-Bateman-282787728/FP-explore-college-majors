6994032,5,B00SWZIZIO,"I'm an avid Tracy Anderson fan so I ordered this DVD as soon as it became available . I'm a stay at home mom with a toddler and a newborn so the six , ten minute segments work perfect for me.
 This DVD has many of the same moves from her mat and precision toning DVDs along with new exercises. I don't believe you could get a full workout by just doing one ten minute segment, I would need to do at least three to feel accomplished . This isn't her toughest workout but I still felt a burn. Most exercises in this workout have around 10 reps, much less then her others. I think this would be a great introduction to Tracy's method or add on to cardio.",1427328000,48,651,4.046511627906977
6994033,4,B00SWZIZIO,"I just received this dvd yesterday and was so anxious to try it,as the YouTube clip of the excercises looked very promising! There are many things I liked about this workout-the set was very bright and I loved the background. Plus Tracy was very cheerful in this(she can come across as snooty)and her cueing was much better. I have many of her dvds and sometimes the moves are hard to follow,due to lack of cueing,especially when you're on your knees. I enjoyed all the segments,with the exception of Abs. Normally I love her abs moves,but I just didn't care for the moves in this part,plus my Abs didn't feel worked. So I substituted the Abs part from her Mat workout. Overall,I would recommend this and see myself doing it often,especially since each section is 10 minutes. I know people have a love/hate relationship with Tracy's workouts. I base my opinion on what she does for my body-I especially love her arms moves-I have always done heavier weights workouts and for some reason,lately my arms tend to look bulky in photos. Due to some injuries,I have moved on to workouts using very light weights with high reps and find that my arms look so much more toned,but not bulky. I als love the Tonique workouts,although the most recent ones are too difficult for me. I am 48 and am starting to see my body take on a more toned,sleeker look thanks to Tracy's workouts.",1426464000,82,1370,4.6419753086419755

6994037,3,B00SWZIZIO,There are no modifications for the shoulder/arm workouts. Be very careful if you have shoulder injuries and back problems. The moves are done fast which can cause accidental jerky movements. I would recommend no weights for people with shoulder and back injuries and then progress to 2 and 3lbs weights when you have mastered the routine. Tracy should offer modifications........ that's why I'm giving this DVD a firm 3 stars.,1511654400,5,426,5.1

6994043,5,B00SWZIZIO,"The best 10 minute routines that can get you sweating.  Tracy goes quickly, 10 counts each rep, and exercises every muscle in the particular routine.  Perfect for those days when I don't have time for 30 or more minutes.  I actually do the 2 arm routines in a row.",1500681600,2,264,4.346938775510204

6994046,5,B00SWZIZIO,"I haven't worked out in quite sometime, and after having my third child the workouts that were once effective were not making a difference anymore. Needless to say, I became very discouraged. I've wanted to try Tracy Andersons exercise programs, and finally decided to try one. I've only worked out ONE TIME, and I feel muscles that I've NEVER felt in all of my various workouts (I've tried SO many). She moves quickly, and time moves by so fast, you don't realize you've done 20-30 minutes of a workout, except for the sweat pouring down your face! I'm hooked, and excited to continue...I've NEVER been excited to continue a workout!",1497657600,10,634,4.7727272727272725

The moves are good and the instruction is clear and easy to follow. One thing I wish had been mentioned in the description or featured in Amazon's ""people who bought this also bought"" section is THREE POUND WEIGHTS. I had some 8lb dumbbells at home, but they are too heavy to use with these exercises. You have to go out and buy some 3lb. dumbbells.",1494201600,9,532,4.174757281553398

6994051,5,B00SWZIZIO,"I want to start off by saying I think Tracy Anderson is a genius. I think most of her harsh criticism comes from people who purchase her DVDs without understanding her method and expect it to be like every other workout they've tried. This is one of my favorites, the moves are not too complex but feel very effective. It's fun with 10 minute segments and has nice flow, I usually pause in between to stretch. If you like Precision Toning this is similar, but better.",1489622400,18,467,4.441860465116279

6994054,4,B00SWZIZIO,"This video has some unusual moves as does most Tracy Anderson videos.  I like the way the videos are categorized by type of exercise.  Some of the upper arms exercises I do have some concerns that if not done properly could cause injury.  The speed of the movements is kind of fast.
The exercises were difficult at first.  It's a workout in a short amount of time.",1481328000,2,364,4.388059701492537
6994055,1,B00SWZIZIO,The most boring work out video I have ever purchased.,1479340800,,53,4.4
6994056,5,B00SWZIZIO,"the ""express"" series from Tracy rock comparing to her earlier releases that are would be on high-advanced level. If you are new to Tracy's approach and are average fitness level, this video and others from 2015 series are great to start with. she changed her approach where there's verbal cues as to the moves (vs. some of her early releaves from back in 2006-08 such as metamorphesis series). I've started with the ""express"" series and got my endurance built up after 2 months of regular 1 hr/per day 7 days a week workout regime. Now I am doing metamorphosis series, which when I first tried I almost gave up. I consider myself on the average endurance level since I've been doing J. Michaels for over 1 yr and Insanity regularly (5-6 times a week).

Tracy's method is great if you are looking for a dancer's fit body with high endurance. It does not give you huge or eyepopping muscles which are common with other heavy weight lifting programs. So, keep that in mind, if you goal is to have a lean dancer-like all-over-toned body with having your fitness endurance built up where you can jump and run like back when you were a child, go with Tracy's method.",1477699200,12,1160,4.576923076923077

6994058,5,B00SWZIZIO,I've been a fan of Tracy since I saw her with Gwyneth on Oprah years ago!  She was the only trainer who would admit that certain exercises do make you bigger!!!  Thank you Tracy!  I love the 10 minute breakdowns in this video.  The time goes by faster which is always a plus!,1474588800,6,275,4.132075471698113
6994059,5,B00SWZIZIO,I have been doing her workouts on YouTube but wanted something I could pop in my DVD player. I love that they are quick and to the point. I actually enjoy doing these workouts and can feel it in a good way. Started to see some changes :),1473897600,3,237,3.9583333333333335
6994060,5,B00SWZIZIO,"This is an awesome workout DVD to do when you are pressed for time. I have a 6 month old baby so needless to say it's hard to find time to workout. I started with her post pregnancy workout DVD (which is the best! I have a better body now than I did pre-preg, lost all the weight and got long lean muscles all over) and switch to this one when I want to squeeze a workout in. Each section is only 10 minutes but the moves are super efficient and if you do them right you will break a sweat. I love Tracy's workouts. Between this one, the post preg one & her Met set I have gotten into the best shape of my life in just a few months and gone from a size 8 to a size 4. If your looking for great results quickly buy this and use it to compliment her longer, more intense dvd's.",1473206400,6,775,3.85
6994061,4,B00SWZIZIO,This is a good workout IF you don't have any back issues. I have 2 herniated discs (from a car accident) and this messed up my back again. I believe it was the planks I had to go get shots from the doctor (could barely walk). Nothing beats her Mat workout which I will go back to doing and I continue to do walking workouts.,1471478400,10,324,4.0
6994062,5,B00SWZIZIO,Love Tracy Anderson and her method! I purchased this as a gift for my sister and she loves it.  She said it is super fun and easy to follow and loves how it is broken down.  You can't go wrong with TA!,1471392000,,201,3.761904761904762

The first sessions are great, but beware that you won't get the full DVD.",1471305600,2,244,3.764705882352941
6994064,5,B00SWZIZIO,Love Tracy Anderson hands down. This video however gives the option of picking the parts of the body I want to work based in time available to me. The ten minute segments are focused and concentrated. She did it again!,1469404800,,218,4.475
6994065,5,B00SWZIZIO,I really enjoyed this one.  The moves are so different than what I do now.  I divided it up into two days 30 minutes each.  I was sore in places I had never been before.

I'm coming back from an injury so I can't yet to the full hour, so I do two 10 minute sections and then I do some type of cardio each day.  I was really surprised with my arms, because I didn't feel like I was doing much until I could barely move the next day!",1468627200,3,320,3.8333333333333335
6994068,2,B00SWZIZIO,"Awkward movements, felt like I was aggravating my joints trying to do her poses and exercises. I like Jillian Michael's 30 day shred better.",1468108800,5,140,4.875
6994069,4,B00SWZIZIO,"I rotate through about 6 workout DVD's and just recently added TA's Method Express to my rotation.  I like that the moves are different than what you do with many other workouts.  I feel the muscles while I'm working and afterwards.  I like that the music and Tracy aren't cheesy like a lot of other DVD's that I've purchased.  Some people don't like that she just counts off the reps, but I don't mind that because she seems real and isn't trying to fake being super energetic, which gets on my nerves.  The only negatives that I have are that the moves are difficult because most of them are unlike anything that anyone else is doing...I like that, but she doesn't do a good job of setting you up or walking you through the moves.  I've completed the entire DVD 4 times now and I still don't think I'm doing all of the moves correctly because she goes so fast and you try to keep up while watching her form.  Most moves are only completed for 10 reps, so when I feel like I've figured out a move, she is already moving on to the next one.  I really feel like it's working though, so I'll be sticking with it and hoping that over time, I'll master the moves.",1467849600,3,1159,4.260273972602739

6994073,5,B00SWZIZIO,"This video is great for me. My time for working out is very limited, no time for me to hit the gym. The ten minutes can be done anytime of the day and you can challenge your self if necessary. A couple of dumbells and you are done!

6994080,5,B00SWZIZIO,"Great workout but i highly recommend doing the entire DVD for 1hr or at least 4 of the first 10min (arms, glutes, abs, and legs) together for a good workout. And if short on time doing the last 2 full body express workouts (upper and lower body) together since some moves are repeated from the first few sessions. I have most of her DVDs and this is now one of my favorites. She does less reps than usual (5-10, and 20 for a couple of glute/leg) but I felt it more than some of her usual routine so I enjoyed it. This DVD can be broken down into two great 40 or 20min workouts. I wouldn't do just 10min, unless you are combining with other exercise.",1463184000,5,649,4.158730158730159

It is great if you're short on time or just want to work on one part of your body. I love to use this video in addition to her other video's to tone my arms. It is very easy to follow. You do need weights for this video 3 and 5 pound weights, and ankle weights. Overall, I love this video, and I would suggest it to anyone who wants some variety in their workout routine.",1463184000,2,546,4.11214953271028
6994082,5,B00SWZIZIO,"What worked for me:
-the format: the 10 minute segments allowed me to do 2x 30 minute sessions or 3x 20 minute sessions, ie, it was easy to fit the workout into my schedule
-i found the segments effective for the target areas
-nothing jarring or high impact

What I didn't like
-the stretches didn't seem enough
-more instruction

I am a fan of Ballet Beautiful, Bar Method, Ellen Barrett, Exhale, Yogaglo - I work out 5 hours per week.  I guess I am expecting a more fluid workout that is a little more natural.  This felt really awkward, annoying and unnecessarily complicated.  I finished it, but I miss the quality stretching between sets that all of the above include, I felt stiff and cranky when I finished this, not what a dressage rider needs, I need to have strength that is fluid and moves with my horse. I started with the 20 minute cardio that was too dancey so that probably didn't set me up to love this workout.

6994089,4,B00SWZIZIO,"I own many of Tracy's DVDs, and like this one, although it does have some flaws. First off, the arm section is mostly with weights, unlike her usual arm routines. So if you want the no weight option, you will have to use a different DVD. During her leg section, she only does 10 reps and switches sides several times. Therefore, I feel like I'm not getting a thorough workout. Even repeating the section or chapter, is not enough. I do like having new moves, even if I don't like some of them. As I've stated in another review, Tracy patents her exercise moves, so I'm not always a fan.. I use this one as an add on to another workout.",1457740800,2,635,4.256198347107438
6994090,4,B00SWZIZIO,"Maybe it's not her best, but I really enjoyed this new Method Express DVD by Tracy. It's a great solution for those who have not much time to workout. The DVD is made up of 6 sections: 4, 10 minute long sequences which work different parts of the body (arms and shoulders, abs, legs and butt) and 2, 10 minute express versions of the workouts to tone up your upper and lower body.

The first 4 are great if you have time to do them all and to add some cardio for a full 1 hour workout; the final two are the perfect solution if you're in a hurry for work or a date, because you get your daily workout session anyway.

Level: all levels and it's good even for those who tried Metamorphosis (less challenging, but not too easy).
Equipment needed: a set of 3 pound weights (optional: another one of 5) and a set of ankle weights.
Suggestion: Mix this up with the sequences from Tracy's Slim + Sculpt DVD.",1456876800,7,901,4.232558139534884
6994091,4,B00SWZIZIO,"This is actually my favorite Tracy Anderson dvd so far. Maybe I'm just out of shape enough and with enough injuries that I can only handle 10 minutes at a time. In all seriousness, I am not a total wimp but I do have a toddler and some days it's pushing it to even have 10 minutes without him hanging on my legs. Plus I also like that Tracy has some original moves that I haven't seen in other exercise DVDs and they seem to be effective. My only complaint is that there are a couple of points where the background music just abruptly stops in the middle of the workout but then randomly starts again a few minutes later. Weird.",1456444800,4,628,4.198347107438017
6994092,5,B00SWZIZIO,"10 minutes. It's been 10 minutes. I've been working out all my life, doing lots of strength training (and unhappily bulking up), floor pilates (and happily toning up but not losing much weight). But after 10 minutes with Tracy, I can tell I'm getting the best of both worlds. This S#!t *hurts.* It is no joke.

Tracy doesn't break down every single move, but I feel that this is part of the magic. Your brain has to work, too, which is critical to benefiting from any workout. Though challenging, the moves are, however, not ridiculously difficult; but they're intense and clearly fatigue the muscle in a good way.

I'll come back and update once I'm on week 5 or so.",1455840000,9,667,4.55

Hand me a pair of weights and traditional cardio moves and I will do it to stay fit but it's annoying.  Put me on a treadmill, forget about it.  I like activities that are precision movements that require mastery to really utilize and keep you mentally stimulated.  Tracy Anderson's workouts are exactly that. I change the DVDs (routines) up every 10 days like she does with her membership programs.  I do 1 hour of her muscular structure type videos so 1 whole dvd like Method Express, Precision Toning, Targeted Training Boot Camp, etc.  Then I do 20mins of Cardio Dance Express (6, 10min routines) or Slim Sculpt Cardio (3, 20min routines) then I cool down with stretching for 10mins.  This routine 5-7 days per week has shown me incredible results.  I'm nearing the end of my first month and I can see the shape of my body changing.  My thighs are starting to narrow and are definitely firmer.  My really skinny calves are getting bigger and my butt is lifting and rounding out in a good way.  My abs aren't hard yet but they have those long grooves down both sides and my stomach is flatter.  My arms are toning up all over and my pectoral muscles (boob lift) are gaining mass. If I keep this up my body is going to look like a model and since college I have always been slightly on the verge of chubby.  Also, most days I changed my breakfast to a power smoothie with Milk, a little whey, fruit and veggies.  Lunch is lots of veggies and lean protein like a salad or grilled veggies with chicken. Dinner is whatever I want and however much I want before 7pm, even bread and dessert!  I didn't want to count calories and I wanted my health habits to be about balance, fun, and energy.  I gave up my scale and desire to lose weight and made it about feeling good and it has been amazing.  Working out first thing in the morning + eating lean for breakfast and lunch keeps my energy up throughout the entire day so I am really productive and energetic.  I love cooking or eating out and ordering whatever the heck I want for dinner.  I can't wait to see my body after month two and feel so lucky to have found a routine that really fits me.  I will say you get what you put into these workout.  The first time around you are getting through the routine but as you get better you realize how to get the most out of each move. Tilting your foot this way, lifting it just that much higher so you feel your butt engage. . .it's little things like angles and height, toe pointed or flexed, rotation of the leg, adding up to 2.5lb ankle weights when ready.  As your perfect and grow stronger there is always a way to get more out of a move so you can get a lot out of these DVDs no matter what your fitness level.  Hope this helps someone out there that is searching for something unique like this :)",1454025600,37,2985,4.308243727598566

6994110,5,B00SWZIZIO,"I am on week 5 and I have always been pleasantly plump even when working out 6 days a week doing cardio and heavy lifting. Everyone nowadays claims that women need to lift heavy and it is a myth that we will bulk up. Well for me, that is a lie. I bulked up considerably. To the point to where I gained weight and got bigger all over. I was eating healthy/Paleo so I know it was my fitness routine.  I was so fed up with trying everything under the sun to change my body and I started to feel defeated. I realized that I may have to settle for this body. Once again, I saw something on Tracy Anderson and as always I was willing to try anything but really did not have alot of hope. I started by using her YouTube videos and they were very unusual compared to what I am used to. I was thinking to myself how all of these weird non-weighted movements would do anything to transform my body. She has a very unusual method and I thought what the heck. I would give it a go. I stopped lifting weights the first time in over 2 years and after a week of doing this funky method my body was slimming out for the first time in forever. I even wondered if it was all in my head. lol Now  after 5 weeks I am receiving compliments from people and my husband who always responds vaguely because my body never changed before. I am more flexible than I ever have been and my body is getting tiny. ME...TINY?! WHAT? Don't knock this until you try it. I don't know why after everything else I have done that these workouts work for me but I don't care. They work and I won't go back. I really enjoy the workouts and I actually just do my own cardio. I eat the majority of the time Paleo and ecstatic to buy more workout videos from Tracy. Who would have thought that these odd angle movements would be hard work and make the changes they do.

6994126,5,B00SWZIZIO,"I just received this dvd today. The main reason I started doing tracy Anderson is because she normally doesn't have you doing  squats ( squats tend to bulk me up) but in this video she does. So that part I don't care for.
For the most part most of her  moves are new but there are some you will recognize from previous dvds.
I do like the fact that there tends to be less reps because I have a hard time doing forty reps like she has you doing in some of her other videos.
I find myself buying a lot of her videos as I tend to get very board doing them and I switch every couple of days instead of every ten days like she recommends.
She is a lot more explanatory in this dvd and I think it will become my favorite so far out of all her videos.
Tracy Anderson works, you just have to be consistent and watch your diet and you will see results !
Though I am confused on why she had a sudden change about  using five pound weights when before she said it was a big no no to go above three pounds.",1436140800,7,994,3.910891089108911

I've heard these things in every workout video I've ever seen, except for Cory Everson's. Tracey says it at least 15 times halfway through. I lost track after that.
