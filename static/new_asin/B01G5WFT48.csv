8762346,5,B01G5WFT48,"Tremendous feat of casting makes this an unstoppable must see TV with intertwining tales of prison life in a women's penitentiary that involves not only the inmates but the guards and head honchos in charge, and many glimpses of family life before and after. Scriptwriters must have had a field day with this one and it definitely shows. I have seen all seasons and was never once disappointed. Absolutely great, and the only downfall is it kind of makes you want to visit one, and it would be a shame to find it isn't this much fun.",1498780800,,533,4.505154639175258
8762347,5,B01G5WFT48,"Brilliantly done series that over time explores the stories of women who have been imprisoned.  Their lives are attended to with respect and compassion, and it all has the sweep and feel of a great novel.  I laughed a lot and cried a lot while watching Orange is the New Black, drawn deeper and deeper into the characters' interior and exterior realities.  Dostoevsky would have dug it.  I have since given a copy of the first three seasons to my sister and her partner.",1493942400,,470,4.559523809523809
8762348,5,B01G5WFT48,"Lovin it. No what I expected. It's more of a drama that a comedy, which is not what I expected. I love the characters. Still watching first season. I bought daughter 1-3.",1484438400,,170,4.34375
