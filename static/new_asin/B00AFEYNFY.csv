But it must be said that the quality looks like that of a cassette tape.",1485648000,,132,4.115384615384615
8550910,5,B00AFEYNFY,"Sidney Lumet leads a brilliant cast through a fine adaptation of the great work.  As always, Lumet's direction is understated, perceptive and ultimately eloquent.  The cast is remarkable and the film, an overlooked gem.",1440288000,,219,5.411764705882353

8550913,3,B00AFEYNFY,"Just not that interesting a movie.  Chekov was a wonderful writer, capturing the foibles of the middle and upper classes of Russian society.  Simone Signoret was a marvelous actress.  But this dvd bored me.  It just comes off as too chatty, too intellectual.",1395273600,,258,4.930232558139535
8550914,3,B00AFEYNFY,"Sideny Lumet is among the best directors of the past 50 years but this is one of his rare misses.
Things pick up in the second half but Simone and Mason and Warner are miscast.",1391472000,2,176,4.057142857142857
8550915,2,B00AFEYNFY,"With Mason, Redgrave, Warner, Andrews, and Signoret, this movie had to be good.  Right?  Wrong.  The actors sleep walked their way through the story.  Mason, in particular (who can do no wrong in my estimation) appeared to have wandered in from another set.  Stilted, overly mannered, and, did I mention, boring,  The long shots were fuzzy - did Lumet do this on purpose?  I couldn't tell if the fault lay in the dvd or the director, but I suspect the latter.  If I were to designate the culprit in this profligate waste of talent, I'd blame the director.  Bad show, all around.",1389571200,4,578,4.588235294117647
8550916,5,B00AFEYNFY,"FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! The wait is over. Sidney Lumet's long last masterpiece is finally gonna be available to own. This is 1 of his many great 60's films.
Their once was a guy cooler then Sean Connery who despite being 50, Almost actually played Bond originally until the director found Connery.

Needless to say that man Is James Mason. Almost everything he's in he brings his cool classy swagger. You can insert him in almost any time period & it works more then the whored out Leo DeCaprio who mostly just looks like a guy from the 90's acting.

Besides 1 of the greatest directors of all time with 1 of the greatest actors of all time. What really helps this movie is the genius work of Gerry Fisher. This man is responsible for pioneering 1 of the greatest things 2 ever hit Epic films & period pieces. Of course I'm talking about Flash Fogging. If you need an example, I'll name some. But the most famous case is Deliverance. The effect was made bigger by Vilmos Zsigmond.

However Gerry has shot some great films including The Ninth Configuration, Dead Bang, Highlander, Original Man On Fire & Yellowbeard. Even Mel Brooks meets Monty Python type movie like Yellowbeard has a great epic look to it compared to modern films.

Now hear is the main reason not to miss this. James Mason gives a great speech about why being a writer sucks. It's so poetic & genius much like his rant about alibi's in Evil Under the Sun. That alone is worth the price. Now all We need is The Appointment which isn't as great as this but still pretty good.",1355616000,9,1537,4.517985611510792
