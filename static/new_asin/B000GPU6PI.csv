Put simply, two women fall in love with Padayappa (the lead guy played by Superstar Rajinikant, of course): one really bad, and one relatively good. Who wins? That's for you to find out. You'll also see a more serious, charismatically cool and take-charge kind of Rajini in all his usual shining glory as he struts in slow-motion through the movie's dance numbers, particularly ""Vazhkayil Aayiram"" and the title track ""En Peru Padayappa."" The dance scenes are exciting and fun, especially the sexy and catchy ""Suthi Suthi"" with its lovely costume changes and cute dance moves. But the most moving for me was the death/jealousy dance of Nilambari (played brilliantly by Ramya Krishnan) an emotionally-charged take on the god Shiva's ""Dance of Destruction,"" slightly (but not co-incidentally) reminiscent of the same dance performed by veteran actor Shivaji in the old classic Kollywood flick ""Thiruvilaydal""(1965). (And yes, that's Shivaji himself playing Padayappa's dad in this movie, his last cameo film appearance before his passing in 2001).

Rather than stunning sets or innovative cinematography, which is somewhat lacking in this film, the emotional quality of the acting and the interesting twists in the plot carried my interest through to the end. ""Padayappa"" is a decent mix of action and romance but it could've seen that fifth star had the editing been a little cleaner. Other than that, this is one of my favorite DVDs that I'm proud to own.",1161734400,2,1575,5.104651162790698
