6266248,5,B00IJLNQYY,"Kudos to the previous reviewer, excellent job! I can't remember the color of the pill Neo took in the movie ""The Matrix"". I only know that most Americans have taken the other pill, the one the Mainstream Media and the Power Elite have jammed down their throats. Hopefully the real truth will come out one day before our Children and Grandchildren become enslaved in the Matrix of deceit that has been perpetuated upon them.",1400112000,9,423,4.72972972972973
6266249,5,B00IJLNQYY,"This thriller tells the story of how the destruction of the World Trade Center towers and the attack on the Pentagon might have been accomplished as an inside job.  The story is told from the viewpoint of the participants and how they intended to establish the frame of Muslim Terrorists as the cover story. The whole operation is done as a top secret project started at the direction of James McCullough, an elite member of ""The Council"" (conspiracy buffs will immediately recognize who they are).  The project is coordinated by a small team of CIA agents who are assigned the job with Aaron Delgado as its leader. A team of aerospace engineers is assembled to design the remote-controlled planes for the attack and is sworn to secrecy, even to the point of not specifying how the planes are to be used. (""That information is above our pay grade."")  Delgado and fellow agents, Phillip Singer and Chase Jordan, work with a group of unsuspecting engineers to develop unmanned jets that will hit their assigned targets.

The Army and the FBI begin to uncover the plot, forcing Delgado to intervene. The CIA agents also have to deal with an increasingly suspicious George Poole, the lead engineer working on the drones, who becomes skeptical on how the remote controlled planes will be used. A battle between good and evil ensues as the plot to attack America becomes a hard-hitting reality.

The filmmakers went to quite some trouble to use as much publicly available information about 9/11 as possible, such as Secretary of Transportation Norman Maneta's account of what took place on 9/11 in the Presidential command center deep beneath the White House, using the exact dialog as given by Maneta. 9/11 may not have happened exactly as depicted in this film, but it does conform to what most of us have been able to find. Kudos to director/actor Paul Cross and producer Art Olivier for getting the most ""bang"" out of a shoestring budget.

I recommend watching it twice ... first as the ""Political Thriller"" that it is ... and a second time with the Producer and Director talking about each scene and which scenes are based on testimony and interviews and those that are fictional ""to fill in the blanks.""",1393027200,21,2203,4.814814814814815

8642624,5,B00IJLNQYY,"This movie was one of the few that I sat through the entire film without taking any breaks. It was both entertaining and educational as far as having many ""true"" events not told to the general public. It was just as good if not better than any large budget hollywood film. I hope to see this director and filmmaker do other true, big events like maybe from the book, ""Nobody Died at Sandy Hook - It was a FEMA Drill"". The actors in this film were wonderful!!",1449100800,,458,4.275862068965517
8642625,3,B00IJLNQYY,"Dated, vague and missing depth. There is so much that's been unfortunately left out of context in this movie. Unless you're a real ""MIHOP Truther"" there is no point of reference for the much of the content. That's truly unfortunate, because if you're going to take the time and effort to make this movie at all, then you may as well have expanded on the generally accepted facts to the point that makes sense to a lay person. This movie just speeds through them. I was disappointed and expected more. Hats off to the makers for their bravery for at least attempting some rendition of of what very well may have been the most horrific false flag operation in history.",1437696000,,666,4.558333333333334

8642628,5,B00IJLNQYY,"I am involved in the 9/11 Truth Movement, and was very impressed with this movie. It's hard to believe that this movie was done on an estimated $100,000 budget. It's NOT a documentary, but shows how several events on 9/11 may have been pulled-off, in the form of a story (similar to a spy-thriller). It touches on the concepts of: compartmentalization, plausible deniability, nanothermite, the corporatization of the elitist media, Norman Mineta's testimony, the whistleblower Barry Jennings, how oil acquisition relates to the War on Terror, different government agencies not being on the ""same page,"" the outrageous official story of Flight 93, the ridiculous story of Flight 77 and the insensitivity/arrogance of our behind-the-scenes ruling elite. I don't think everything in the movie actually happened, but I KNOW that what happened on 9/11 was distorted in the ""9/11 Commission Report."" The Family Steering Committee reported that roughly 70% of their questions to the 9/11 Commission were either insufficiently addressed or completely ignored. The White House and their lawyers aggressively tried to block the creation of an investigation (originally) into the greatest attack on our nation's soil in history. It was the Jersey Girls who lobbied our representatives into the eventual establishment of the 9/11 Commission. Kean/Hamilton eventually would write about their questioning of the validity of their information in a January 2008 article in the New York Times, as well as in their book, ""Beyond Precedent."" We know that the report was: underfunded, set up to fail, was lied to by various government agencies, had multiple conflicts of interest and omitted and/or distorted much witness testimony (Mineta, Edmonds, LCDR Shaffer, Jennings, Rodriguez), and was a cover-up from start to finish. Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth is comprised of approximately 2,300 architects and structural engineers who question the NIST official explanations of the 3 buildings that collapsed on 9/11 (the Twin Towers and Building 7). Some of the 9/11 victims' family members were involved in creating the video ""Zero,"" which describes their successful efforts to demand an investigation and their problems with the official story of 9/11. They helped create a TV commercial about the collapse of Bldg. 7 (which wasn't hit by an airplane, but collapsed in under 7 seconds at approximately 5:20 PM on 9/11, which was announced before it occurred by CNN and BBC). I wish the great men that made this movie (""Operation Terror"") safety and prosperity!",1427155200,4,2549,5.359102244389027
8642629,4,B00IJLNQYY,"It was great, I agree with how the movie says things happen and that the elites initiated this but a lot of details were left out including
all the Israelis that were involved in this False Flag event.  This needed to be a mini series not a movie but I understand the limitations.",1425945600,2,280,4.283018867924528
8642630,5,B00IJLNQYY,This was an excellent video.  It depicted just about my complete idea of what really happened on 9/11.,1422576000,3,102,4.666666666666667
