8173852,5,B000N1AFJ2,"Youg Boy turns super hero, defending his natural habitat from destruction! And from an unexpected source. Beautifully shot, lovable kid; who gets himself in deep trouble trying to defend local wildlife in the wilderness' whilw other interests are trying to trap and destroy. A fabulous film. The kid is amazing. The old Indian is just right (old Indian? In Scandinavia?) This you've got to see! IF you can play the PAL (non-US) Standard. Good image quality. Try to see it with the whole tribe (ah, family). Highly recommended.",1252713600,,526,4.988636363636363
