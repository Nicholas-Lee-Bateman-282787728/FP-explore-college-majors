7950478,2,B00005QFGJ,"Following the controversial documentary, ""Welcome To Death Row"", the notorious head of Death Row Records, Suge Knight decided to tell his version of the story. This authorized version really doesn't tell much at all about most of the events covered on ""Welcome"". In fact, it is just a couple of old interviews with Suge edited together with some classic Death Row videos (most of which were already shown on ""Death Row Uncut""). The most entertaining stuff is pulled from an exclusive BET interview with Knight just a few weeks prior to his prison release in which he claims that Dr. Dre told him that he wanted to be white and details how Snoop Dogg and Tupac had a serious falling out before Pac's death. Most of this video is dedicated to Knight trying to make his enemies look bad and plug his musical catalog as very little time is spent speaking on his own life and the start of his label. Only die-hard fans should bother with this one.",1082851200,,942,4.579881656804734
