4083056,1,B00383XYUO,"MOTHER'S DAY MASSACRE doesn't take place on Mother's Day---and that's not the only thing that doesn't make sense.
e.g.  The gynecologist in the opening scene later turns up as a perverted hypnotherapist.
e.g.  What does the snuff film have to do with anything?
e.g.  Why would anyone put up the $500 budget for a mess like this?
As usual, the world's oldest teenagers are typically obnoxious and unsympathetic.
The attempts at humor include the reference to Michael Myers' hometown of Haddonfield even though this howler is supposedly set in the South but filmed in New Joisey.  Add the cookie making sequence and the killer's huge boner to the list of flaccid failures (pun intended).  I guiltily admit I enjoy a cheesy movie but not when they're this moldy!",1307577600,3,759,4.8984375
4083057,1,B00383XYUO,"There have been many horror movies with ""massacre"" in the title. My favorites are The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Remake), and Slumber Party Massacre 2 (!). However, I won't be adding Mother's Day Massacre to that list.

There is only one bright spot in Mother's Day Massacre, and it has nothing to do with a massacre. It has to do with Greg Travis, who plays a profanity spewing redneck who gets all of the films best lines. Other than him, it's mostly a badly scripted, badly directed low-budget gore-comedy with not enough gore and even less comedy.

Watch Mother's Day or Texas Chainsaw Massacre again, or for the first time. Those are obviously the movies this wants one wants to be like...and fails at.",1275868800,7,734,4.771653543307087
4083058,4,B00383XYUO,"Right off the bat I see someone get their head smashed in by a pan full of bacon ... I know I am in for a treat. It's a classic story of teens, boobs and blood - with a lot of twists and turns along the way. This is your classic B movie filled with classic moments. If your into creepy B movie horror this is a good buy.",1273881600,6,320,3.652173913043478
8391031,1,B00383XYUO,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2007 and directed/written by Jeff Roenning, Mother's Day Massacre is a slasher revolving around a group of New Jersey teens going to Redneckville to find the long lost mother of one of them. Havoc ensues when a couple of psycho rednecks attack.

The catchy oddball rock song by House of X that plays over the creative opening credits and the girl who plays Steph (whose role is brief) are the only reasons for maybe watching this trash. The other two females are okay and the overall filmmaking isn't bad for amateurs. There are attempts at goofy, crude humor. It could've worked, but it's brought down by irrelevant, nonsensical scenes and a sleazy, vulgar degenerate tone. Too much of the runtime takes place in a rank dilapidated house.

THE MOVIE RUNS 77 minutes and was shot in northern New Jersey.

Hmm, it looked pretty big - was it real or wishful thinking?  hahaha  - what a stupid movie, almost too stupid, so dumb, so retarded.

8391038,1,B00383XYUO,"This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. It feels like it was written by a group of frat boys during a weekend party at college. The plot, if you want to call it that, is dumb high school boy has a douche bag for a father. His girlfriend talks him into going to the wilds of New Jersey to find his long lost mother. Four other dumb friends come along. Once they are in the town of Johnsville they split up to explore the houses in the abandoned town where they eventually meet two psycho hicks who kill a few of them and three get away and go back home. Eventually the psychos and their mother come looking for the one's that escaped. There's a little more to it than that but I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure of this piece of industrial waste if you ever get desperate enough that you'll stick absolutely anything in your DVD player.",1365724800,,854,4.213414634146342

I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE IT A STAR, BUT IF I MUST I WILL.  I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH HOW BAD THIS IS.",1324684800,,265,3.6140350877192984
8391040,3,B00383XYUO,"This is a grindhouse style movie. 1990: A woman is at her gyno (David Chen) who claims she has a mild case of VD, maybe she got from a public toilet seat, according to her ill informed doctor. She knows the woman who infected her husband and goes to her house for some kind of justice, only to get her head smashed in with a frying pan. Key grindhouse death metal music, run opening credits.

We now come to modern day. Jim (Adam Scarimbolo) is at home with his girlfriend Doreen (Emily Grace). They are taking a bath together, apparently as a prelude to their first time together. Then suddenly his dad, Tex (Greg Travis, a native of Texas whose accent sounds fake) is home and an instant later in the bathroom with them as the girl ""hides"" behind a frosted glass shower door, her outline clearly visible. Dad demonstrates he is somewhat psychotic. The incident however does not deter teen hormones and 8 weeks later Doreen has morning sickness...in the afternoon.

Doreen located Jim's mother, who abandoned him, on the Internet as his dad's crudeness escalates. Jim finds an old 8mm/16mm film in his dad's private shed which he shares with the neighbor Jen (Heidi Kristoffer). Meanwhile his dad visits a hypnotherapist friend Sid (Albert Insinnia). They take turns sexually assaulting a hypnotized female patient.

Jim and Doreen head into the Piney's to locate his mom. Jen and her bf Bobby (Noah Fleiss)come along because they saw some pot fields down that way (dark green with red hairs oozing with resin). Their dork friend Gary (Bryan Farrell Wilson, normally a stunt man) joins them as well as his gf Steph(Lauren Waisbren Nathanson) who we discover has vaginal dryness issues.

Our cigarette smoking beer drinking group  arrives at what appears to be abandoned homes (with mowed lawns) and decide to play hide-n-seek. They enter through busted out windows and use the word ""disgusting"" frequently to describe the smell and surroundings. When Jim and Doreen find a bed with blood stained Polaroid snuff pictures they decide it is time to leave. But wait, they are missing 2 people and Bobby wants to see the snuff photos....

It is now a question of who lives and who dies and how does this all tie together with that early 1990 scene.

One Piney has a pop-eye, sign of inbreeding, at least in the movies.
Another Piney wields an ax. You know someone is going to die when his death metal theme music is played.

About this time the movie takes a twist and ties up some plot points, but creates plot problems.

The plot is very weak. The acting weak. The music good, but not enough of it. While these are characteristics we expect in a grindhouse film, this one didn't meet the standard. This is a good first attempt for Jeff Roenning, but clearly he has not mastered the genre.",1308182400,5,2786,4.692622950819672
