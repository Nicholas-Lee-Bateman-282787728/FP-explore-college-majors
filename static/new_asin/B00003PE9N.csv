 I give it four stars firstly because its the original Transformers and secondly because both episodes are from the first season.
The title confused me on how the two episodes are connected but I guess they are.  I hope to see more episodes coming out later on, keep up the good work Kid Rhino.",987379200,,382,4.291666666666667
