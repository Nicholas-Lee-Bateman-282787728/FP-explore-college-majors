8508287,5,6304571429,"Lost in the shuffle between the BETTER TOMORROW phenomenon and Woo's collosal,rep-cementing THE KILLER,this GODFATHER-ESQUE saga is oft-slighted in Woos'Canon of films,if mentioned at all. And that's too bad. Excellent  performances abound from Danny Lee,Chen Kwan Tai,and an intense,early star  turn from soon to be goofmiester Stephen Chow. Possibly/Probably because  this was a collective acting epic instead of focusing on one or two certain  charachters(e.g. Chow Yun-Fat),it's not percieved as accesible as Woo's  other films. Strangely,co-directorial credit is given to HK charachter actor  Wu Ma but Woo's fingerprints are all over this one. From the  brilliant,pre-credit gunfight in blazing daylight to the then-obligatory  destroy-all-mansions shootout,Woo's engaging,hypnotic style is clearly  evident. Thoroughly enjoyable ""heroic Bloodshed"" from the man who  made it a household name. Don't miss it.",957052800,,913,6.174603174603175
8508288,2,6304571429,"I would really liken this film to the Replacement Killers. Antione Fuqua had a real feel for the Hk style gunfights and editing, but that all has to be backed by good characterizations. This film was much the same way.
Co  directed in part by Wu Ma and John Woo (it's obvious Woo didn't write  this). The plot concerns itself with the death of a head triad and the  internal struggle over who will take over. There are many doublecrosses and  scenes of nervous gangsters. But I really couldn't follow the film well. I  have watched it twice now and I still can't remember any characters names  and the causes of some of their actions.
Overall, the plot is cofusing-  VERY confusing. The gunplay sequences are perfectly filmed and show much of  the technical skill he later had perfected in Hard boiled. one big problem  in the end is a very unfunny sidekick who makes jokes (mostly slapstick  uuuggghhh! ).",949449600,,906,4.60625
