It only makes him the legendary cowboy most of time if not all time. That sense of humor does not try to make you laugh like quite some comedians did today, you will laugh when you see Terrence Hill, he is funny in nature in his movie, not try to sell tickets earn big box office records that most comedians did today, that makes him one of a kind and unique, I recommend this movie along with trinity series and my name is nobody.",1476576000,,606,4.45945945945946
8195647,4,B000QCUZRK,"If you like old spaghetti westerns with a bit of comedy, I'd say give Lucky Luke - Nobody's Fool a try. It has a dated sit-com feel to it, which I see as charming. Teens may be too ""sophisticated"" for it, but for those of us of a certain age it will be entertaining.",1472860800,,266,3.9444444444444446

8195649,1,B000QCUZRK,"all Mr. terence Hill's films are great. Mr. Bud Spencer and Mr. Hill are always great together. I think Americans lost  a great actor when Mr. Hill moved to ITALY to make his name, as a great star. I wish Americans can all enjoy the team movies like My Name Is Nobody with Mr. Henry Fonda. So People look up all his films, and enjoy.",1404691200,,333,4.123076923076923
