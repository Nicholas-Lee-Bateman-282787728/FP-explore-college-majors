1790225,4,B00006RCQG,"You cannot go wrong with any of the Firm's workouts.  These new tapes are slightly different than the ""classic"" Firms, but still very effective.  The moves are simple, the music never obtrusive, and the instructors are very personable.  You do need some equipment, but I substituted a Rubbermaid 13 inch step for years with great results.
To respond to the reviewer that said she got bad customer service from the Firm:  The solution is clear -- this is Amazon.com.  Just buy the tapes here and you can be sure to get these great workouts AND excellent customer service.",1038873600,20,570,4.775510204081633
1790226,1,B00006RCQG,"These are not the best Firm tapes that I own, not by a long shot! The music is beyond un-motivating, entering the realm of `WARNING DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC AND WORK OUT OR USE HEAVY EQUIPMENT'! The set is post industrial ugly, like working out in an air conditioning duck, a sad departure from the nice sets they use to use. The workouts them selves do not flow well, the moves made up by instructors looking for anything new, even if uncomfortable and stiff. A much better choice is ""The Firm Total Body- Maximum Body Shaping"", and ""The Firm Cross Trainers: Super Cardio"", those are great videos.",1038787200,25,601,4.522935779816514
1790227,5,B00006RCQG,"First let me say that I have had two babies in the last two years (one in 2001 and one in 2002).  My body needed some serious work.  I used Firm Body and Firm Heart to get back in shape after Baby #1.  It took only about a month.  After Baby #2, my body was so exhausted I couldn't do anybody's tape for the first 3 months.  After 4 months I started using this system and everything is coming back together.  My stomach is flat, my waist is tight and most importantly for me, my hips, thighs, and behind are returning to normal.  These tapes were too difficlut for me when I was extremely out of shape (6 weeks - 3 months after the second baby).  But once I regained my strength using Quick Fix Total Body I needed a better aerobics and toning workout and I knew that is what I would get with The Firm.  You might have to practice the tapes 2 or 3 times before getting the hang of some of the moves, but once you get the hang of it it is actually fun and inspiring.  The tapes keep you moving, sometimes your muscles get exhausted, but you know they are working because you get up in the morning and you feel that wonderful ache that says ""progress is being made.""  In two months I lost 30lbs and went from a flabby 12 to a fabulous 8.  I swear by the Firm.",1038268800,32,1257,4.044534412955466
1790228,1,B00006RCQG,"I have to get word out that if you order from The Firm, you better hope that you paid for what you wanted and no more.  I have had an ongoing battle since March of this year to get refunded 3 times through them after being charged extra for stuff I didn't order.  After several phone calls and letters, I got no response and empty promises.  I reported them the the better bussiness bureau to try and get my money back and they still didn't follow through.  I am beyond angry and very upset and wanted to let everyone know before it happens to someone else.  Even though it has nothing to do with the workout, there are so many other workout routines and tapes that are just as effective.  I hope this at least lowers some of their sales and gets a message across and lets people see that THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIER CUSTOMERS!",1038096000,18,827,4.269230769230769

1790249,4,B00006RCQG,I had purchased VHS tapes years ago. I diet and exercise all the time and always fall off the wagon. I noticed when I did these workouts that I did see results. So I thought I  would purchase the DVD and start again.,1411257600,,216,4.023255813953488

1790262,5,B00006RCQG,"I have a variety of workout DVDs, but this classic firm set is a staple that I always return to. I bought the DVDs after originally having the videos many years ago, but I don't have a VCR anymore.  The invaluable thing about this set is that you will always get an intense workout, no matter your fitness level, by simply varying your weights or doing the modified versions shown on the dvd. The music is upbeat and the instructors are pleasant without being annoying, as can be the case in some exercise DVDs.  This is one of my fav Firm series. Every time I use it consistently for an extended period, I get compliments on how good I look.  Most times, the weight loss is minimal, but the toning that comes with firm workouts makes you look so much more fit!  You won't be disappointed if you're looking for results. Be warned, if you are a beginner, start at your own pace and work your way up.",1365811200,5,898,4.3273809523809526
1790263,5,B00006RCQG,"My mom got me the firm when it first came out almost 10 years ago. And ive been doing this set of videos since then. My vhs finally gave out and I needed to replace them and im glad they still have them. Dont forget you need the step stool with this particular set. But great workout,  I also use insanity and just got zumba to rotate with sinceive been doing it so long its nice to change it up every now and then!!",1359244800,2,416,3.9523809523809526
1790264,3,B00006RCQG,"Rotating through these gives you a pretty good work out and plenty of variety.  Different muscles and different exercises are used in each video so you're not bored super easily.  As with all Firm videos, you have to jump right in.  The first few times may be a little challenging to keep pace until you know which moves to anticipate and kind of have the videos memorized, but they're easy enough to learn.  I have a number of Firm videos, and in every review, I rave about Maximum Cardio Burn plus Abs.  It was my first, my favorite, probably the most difficult, and the most enjoyable.  I use that video to determine the quality of all other Firm videos.",1353888000,,657,4.4789915966386555
1790265,4,B00006RCQG,"I bought this work out at least 7 or 8 years ago on vhs and couldn't find anyone to copy it onto dvd for me so I bought it again! I have a collection of work-out DVD's and haven't found anything that even comes close to this work out. It is just what you need, easy to follow and you really do see and feel results right away - IF YOU STICK WITH IT!",1338336000,3,349,3.72972972972973
1790266,5,B00006RCQG,"I've owned this workout since it came out in VHS format.  It is STILL my favorite workout!!  Glad to find it on DVD so I don't have to worry about the tapes breaking. Granted, you gotta have the fanny lifter...but if you can find it, it is so worth it!  This workout does what it promises for sure!!",1315612800,5,299,4.120689655172414
1790267,5,B00006RCQG,"This is the best set of workout videos I have ever used.  Have been using them a few years and have not found anything better.  Have worn out the VHS tapes and had to replace them with these DVDs!  Challenging, but not impossible to do and you feel like you have gotten a great workout when you are done.  Do this 3X a week and you will definitely see a difference in your body and feel much stronger.  I custom tailored a 1 hour workout for myself using the whole ab workout, Jen's arm workout and the fanny lifter step portion of Allie's lower body workout.  I don't have the fanny lifter, but have found anything sturdy of that height and shape will work.  Like Allie, but not a fan of the faster, grapevine, etc., dance type aerobic section of her workout and always skip that part, although the step part is great and you will get results - stronger, toned, etc.  Same for the arms and abs workouts.  It is nice they have modifications on the exercises for beginners and advanced so anyone can do this workout and increase at their own pace.  Get this set.  You will not be disappointed.  Arrived just as described, in the time frame that was promised.",1305504000,4,1157,4.380281690140845
1790268,5,B00006RCQG,"The only thing I'd add to all the other 5 star reviews, is to use the box segments SEPARATELY if you are out of shape. Yes, the box has a 300 pound weight capacity, but a very heavy person should not do the fanny lifting portion of the workouts with the box fully assembled. It is extremely difficult and could be dangerous. (If you have any issues with your heart, I highly recommend reading Dick Quinn's ""Left For Dead"" to reverse the condition.)
Anyway, take your time and use the purple segment for a while, then the blue and one day you'll find you're ready to move up to the full box.  That's what I did anyway, and it helped me stay with it and not quit.

I have owned my set of Firm workouts since seeing them on tv in 2002 and I love them.  My favorite is body sculpt with Jen. I like Cardio Sculpt with Allie, too but it does have some difficult sequences to follow when you're just beginning. But she ques you verbally at the right times so you know exactly what move is coming. After several times, you get the hang of it and it's fun. I do the ab sculpt once a week and love it, too. Yes, it's a long ab workout (25 min) but it's a good one.

Another bonus - no wasted words during these workouts! No annoying chatter or conversation - just pure training and great tips to proper form. You need to get some dumbells (3, 5 and 8 lb) and buy a fanny lifter - and believe me it is worth the purchase!

These are really excellent workouts that use all the muscle groups and produce amazing results. I prefer this set to the newer ones I got later that use a stick.  And I haven't even tried the wave.  These do it for me and I'm sticking with them.",1300233600,2,1657,4.1114551083591335
1790269,2,B00006RCQG,"Despite the reviews I had read, I decided to buy this Firm pack. I am a big fan of the Firm but this is my least favorite set of workout videos. The routines are very complicated and you can barely hear the instructor's voice over the music which makes matters worse. It's hard to hear the queuing and I got very frustrated. Unfortunately, I wouldnt recommend this workout collection to anyone.",1298851200,,394,4.563380281690141
1790280,4,B00006RCQG,I used these DVDs as a replacement for my old VHS tapes which have served their purpose.  The used DVDs work just fine!,1288656000,,119,4.173913043478261
1790281,3,B00006RCQG,"I don't have all the step up things for this dvd but I use little step stools and it works ok. Not as intense as some other workouts I have done, but it is good to mix it up some days",1273622400,,183,3.4878048780487805
1790282,5,B00006RCQG,"I was very pleased with my order. I have these on vhs but wanted them on DvD, due to my tapes are wearing out.",1271203200,,110,3.625
1790283,5,B00006RCQG,"I have tried several work out videos, and this one is my favorite. The video and sound quality is excellent and I'm always sweating after the workouts. I love that there is an instructor you can follow in modified exercise moves if you are not used to exercising or weight lifting. The music is not annoying, for the most part. The cardio sculpt and body sculpt instructors are likable.

When I first tried the cardio segment of the video, I felt like the moves were too difficult to imitate without rewinding the video several times. However, after using the videos several times I can say that the moves have been mastered. The fanny lifter exercises are intense and difficult when I add weights but completely doable without the weights at this time. I love the variety of exercise moves in the videos and get the impression that the instructors are knowledgeable and not trying to scam me. They repeatedly remind the viewer of safety tips and instructions during the routine. If you eat healthy and use the cardio or body sculpt video for a day you can lose a pound.

I would recommend this exercise regimen to anyone who wants to lose weight and get back into a moderate exercise regimen.",1266883200,,1193,4.649289099526066
1790284,5,B00006RCQG,New and sealed. Great condition! Fast shipping. I've been looking for this on DVD for a long time so thank you a lot!,1251331200,,117,4.130434782608695
1790285,5,B00006RCQG,"I really liked this series.  It helped me to lose a lot of weight within 3 months.  I did do a workout everyday...either the Cardio or Body Sculpt.  The Ab Sculpt on occasion to supplement.  You need to do both workouts to get the maximum results.  As with everything... calories in = calories out ... so the more you eat the more you need to work out HOWEVER, the more muscle you gain the higher your metabolism so at rest you'll expel more calories.  This is why I recommend this DVD set.  I enjoy doing it everyday and I go both the cardio and the resistance workouts to get the results I want faster!!!",1248998400,2,606,4.2631578947368425
1790286,3,B00006RCQG,"These are great workouts. They are hard, they are mixed with different exercises and always moves. You won't get bored. I would have rated higher but the music in all three discs was so loud you have trouble hearing the cues.",1243641600,,225,4.512195121951219
1790287,5,B00006RCQG,"I've been trying to shape up all my life (so it seems).  I keep trying different videos and different programs, but somehow, this is the one I keep coming back to.

The videos recommend that you have a set of light weights and the fanny lifter (which I do also own).  I have friends who do these videos with a step stool or a fitness stepper, but it is easier if you have them.  Cardio Sculpt is my favorite and it has me work up quite a sweat (my fitness level is more on the lower side).  These videos do work out all the major parts of the body.

One thing I do recommend is watching the video or just lightly doing the motions one time before just jumping in.  Some of the movements are not explained as well as they could be, but with watching are easy to pick up.",1228003200,,769,4.052980132450331
1790288,4,B00006RCQG,"Excelente producto, ya lo he utilizado antes en VHS y ahora lo confirmo con el DVD, lo recomiendo ampliamente",1226275200,3,109,4.7894736842105265
1790289,5,B00006RCQG,"this is a great purchase!  I love doing these workouts.... the cues are on task when it comes to identifying with each muscle to be worked.  I appreciate this aspect of these workouts.  It will take all y'all some time to find this out, because you have to view any  workout routine that you do to become accustomed enough to listen.  Hopefully you know this.  Anyway.... I liked them, and I've been working out my whole life.  Enjoy!",1224460800,,434,4.487179487179487
1790300,5,B00006RCQG,"I have been using thefirm cardio workouts for 5 years.  I love them.  I have shape and muscle tone that I have never had before, and after 5 children, I am the same size I was in highschool and college.  I would like to have two or three different cardio dvds so I can have a little variety.  I have literally used mine until it has worn out.  Even after doing them for so long, I still prefer not to use the heavy dumbells.  I use 3 pound most of the time and occasionally 5, sometimes I still don't use any at all and focus on technique and I still feel like I had a great workout after.",1221868800,3,589,3.9491525423728815
1790301,5,B00006RCQG,"'Wow' is all I can say about these workouts!  Initially, I gave myself less than three months to quit this video and find another one to exercise to because I felt like I would die whenever I did any of them. Not only am I with the program to this day, both my boyfriend and my mother say I look as 'fantastic' as I did five years ago! So much so, in fact, that I have to go shopping for new clothes this fall because most of my jeans and shirts are too big for me!  As I said in my original review for this product, Cardio Sculpt with Allie Del Rio and Body Sculpt with Jennifer Carman are the hardest to get through (Despite the length of time, I like Cardio Sculpt best of all); I quit halfway through both of them on my first try.  Today, I get through them by reminding myself of where I was before and where I am now; it was the commitment to working out that got me to where I am today and will keep me there.  As the manual included says, slowly work your way up (Every instructor was a beginner once), stay with it, and you can and WILL get fit.  I initially gave this video four stars for its difficulty.  This time out, I give The Firm a 'firm' rating of five stars!",1219536000,4,1177,4.0085470085470085
1790302,4,B00006RCQG,"I love The Firm workouts, and the instructors are quite good at what they do.  However, the company that distributes these videos needs to work on their consistency.  First off, you can get these same 3 videos all on one CD if you buy from The Firm Direct, for a much better price.  However, their customer service is in India, so don't expect much help if you want to figure out what is happening to your order.
However, when I returned this 3-pack video set to Amazon, they charged me a $22.00 re-stocking fee, which is half the price I paid at first.  What is that all about???????????????  The total was $45.00, as opposed to the $20 I paid The Firm Direct for the all-in-one CD, and then Amazon goes and charges me a restocking fee, which I've never experienced before.
Wow.  I'm not buying from Amazon nearly as much as I had before, especially after this little re-stocking fee incident.  Cya, Amazon!",1209340800,2,908,4.533742331288344

I called AND emailed the company, they said it's all most ready to be shipped, hummm.  Needless to say, if you want the dvd anytime soon get it from Amazon.  BTW, I had the VHS set and the fanny lifter and LOVED it.  I lost 50 lbs, went from a size 18 pushing 20 to a size 6.  I did however do weight watcher and walked too.  But I give the Firm with fanny lifter credit for the toning.  These are killer tapes (DVD's) after doing what I call ""the butt buster"" where you lay over the fanny lifter and put a weight behind your knee and lift your leg over and over... I couldn't sit down for a few days.  Just wait, you'll see.",1203292800,2,795,3.91875

1790305,5,B00006RCQG,"I own Turbo Jam and several FIRM series. I have to say the Firm is the best one I have ever tried. Its more challenging than most workout videos and I love it. When I first got this set I used it for several weeks. I didn't lose a lot of weight in numbers, but I lost inches off my waist, I looked more toned, lost a few inches off my waist and my jeans fit better. I could definitely tell a difference!!! Great, challenging workout. I like Cardio Sculpt the best!",1186704000,4,464,4.054347826086956

The Firm Body Sculpting System has been the best workout I've ever had.  Keep in mind you have to buy the fanny lifter and three sets of weights (I have 2,5, and 8 pounds sets) but even those light weights get hard towards the end of the workout.  I haven't tried any of the newer versions of The Firm because I'm happy with this one.  Finish the three videos sometime throughout the week and I swear you will drop pounds.  Warning....start off slow and easy because it can get difficult depending on the kind of shape you're in.",1179187200,9,766,4.366197183098592
1790307,5,B00006RCQG,A great workout - one that covers all major areas of the body - allows for progress i.e. you may not be able to do everything initially but you can watch your progress as you keep using them. The best thing is that the work outs deliver the results - even if you don't do each exercise to the level and with the weights demonstrated  A downside - there is a piece of equipment used similar to a step -  it comes in 2 heights that is used - I assume that can also be purchased on line.,1168300800,2,484,3.9285714285714284

I own other exercise videos/DVDs (some also in the series), but I love these because they are challenging, basic and approachable, and THEY WORK. There are no impossible-to-follow combinations and no tricky dance moves to frustrate even new users. Yes, it's good to invest in the fanny lifter and sets of dumbbells, but I started with an adjustable aerobic step. There was a booklet with a calendar showing you how to rotate the workout in the original fanny-lifter set with some good information. This set really pushes you and as long as you heed the advice and follow the recommended program, you will benefit without burning out or hurting yourself.",1165276800,2,731,4.71875

1790320,4,B00006RCQG,"This set is an excellent start up Firm workout.  I have owned this since 2003 and whenever I have skimped on my workouts this series gets me right back into the swing of things.  Allie is a great instructor and her choreography is easy to follow.  If you are just starting out the downside is that you will have to invest in 3 sets of dumbbells eventually, however beginners are advised not to use weights due to possible muscle soreness.  Other than the need to buy additional equipment this is a great series.",1159833600,,511,4.462365591397849
1790321,5,B00006RCQG,"These videos are excellent! I started these workouts after I had my first son, and I am beyond belief with the results.

If you're new to The Firm, I would recommend starting with Allie del Rio's Cardio Sculpt. It introduces you to virtually all the moves commonly used in The Firm workouts. The main reason I liked starting out with it, however, is that for the most part, she alternates upper body and lower body movements. This is perfect for beginners who are trying to get acclimated to increased physical strength and endurance: alternating gives you a chance to recover and momentarily rest the muscle groups you just worked. Then, after you've been doing this workout out a while, you'll find that you can challenge yourself by using heavier weights or going deeper with your movements. The end of the workout features a short abdominal section. Great! As always, you need the Fanny Lifter and dumbells: for this particular workout, I use 3, 5, 8, and 10's. This workout is 55 minutes long. Allie's cuing is great in this video. It's not as ""scripted"" as some of her earlier workouts. She seems more relaxed and confident, and I every time I work out, I enjoy every minute of it.

The Firm Body Sculpt with Jennifer Carman is also a WONDERFUL workout. Even though Body Sculpt is shorter than Cardio Sculpt, this is a more intense workout because you do not alternate between upper and lower body: you warm up, do back to back lower body exercises, stretch, and then back to back upper body exercises, and cool down. You could certainly do this workout as a beginner, but you would find it a real challenge. Don't be discouraged, though. If they can do it, you can do it. No abs featured in this one...just hard core upper and lower body. Again, this workout is intense, but the results are well worth it. This workout is 30 minutes long. It requires the Fanny Lifter and dumbells: I use 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10's. Rave reviews! This workout is a great challenge! I often do a few minutes of this workout after the Cardio Sculpt if I'm feeling particularly cocky! The dvd menu allows for you to do this entire workout, or upper/lower body only.

The final workout is Ab Sculpt with Lisa Kay. For me, this one has been the most challenging as I seldom work my abs. This is a great strength and endurance workout. This workout is also about 30 minutes long. This is probably one of the most important areas to work since a strong core upholds the rest of your body while you work out. Great workout.

Overall, I LOVE this series. These are the workouts that made me fall in love with The Firm. I have lost over 15 pounds thus far. But the main ""side benefit"" that I am most grateful for is the strength and endurance and overall increase in fitness that these workouts have given me. I am stronger, can do more, sleep better, have decreased appetite, etc.

I definitely recommend getting the Fanny Lifter (if you can) as opposed to trying to use substitutes. The Fanny Lifter is so perfect for all the movements (of course, they made sure of that so that you would buy it). But no sweat. It's well worth it. Give this one a try, ladies. You won't be disappointed... you will, however, be sculpted, toned, and FIRMED! Thanks for reading! :)",1139788800,14,3239,4.52991452991453
1790322,4,B00006RCQG,"Actually, the review that mentions that the dvd is cheaper on the firmdirect website, IS correct. The dvd on firmdirect combines the three dvds onto one dvd and the description is as follows:

Includes:

Ab Sculpt-Lisa Kay (25 minutes)

Body Sculpt-Jennifer Carman (45 minutes)

Cardio Sculpt-Allie Del Rio (55 minutes)

That seems to be the same exact set of workouts as described for this 3 pack and it is only $19.95.

These are great workouts, but I definately recommend getting the Fanny Lifter to get the most out of them.",1137024000,6,528,4.811111111111111

1790324,4,B00006RCQG,I have started doing The Firm body sculpting system again after a 2 year break and I can definately see results after the first 10 workouts. My favorite tape is Cardio Sculpt. I find it easy to follow and quite a good workout. I don't really like the ab sculpt. It seems kind of easy and long. Body Sculpt is extremely hard! I remembered why I quit the Firm before- this video is killer on the knees.  It moves so fast it is hard to protect your knees. This video also has a section on upper body which is really good- you can skip the lower body if you want.  Also the hard plastic step is a pain in the but to move around on the carpeting. I find the instructor (on all of the videos) is moving on to the next move and I am still taking apart or re-assembling my fanny lifter or switching weights. The music does suck and the set is strange. Why are the girls kneeling on and lying on the wood floor-kind of stupid-bad for back and knees. Looks weird! I don't recommend to anyone with bad knees.,1123027200,2,997,4.134020618556701
1790325,2,B00006RCQG,"I bought this set after someone recommended it, so I went ahead and tried it. Well, for starters, the instructors are fake, fake, fake - everyone is smiling while doing the workout, but ok I can tolerate a lot as long as it works, but that's the problem. The fanny lifter is a good concept, like the step, but smaller - almost too small for cardio, and just using that will get your legs in shape if you stand on it over and over - which will save you from watching the lame videos... the cardio video sucks - once you start getting your heart rate up, you stop to lift some weights, move the fanny lifter, remove the top part of the fanny lifter or change it out for the bottom part, or put the stupid thing back together (why not coordinate the workout so you group the parts with half a lifter together more?) or do something stationary and this continues throughout.

You don't get a cardio workout really, plus then they start putting in all this footsie work, that has absolutely no bearing on shaping anything - the samba, immediately followed by some lame footsie thing - which does not lift your heartrate cuz it's kind of stoppy-starty, because it's all kinda dancy, so I tried simpler moves I took from Susan Powter (which is an excellent step workout- HIGHLY recommend), with an alternate knee lift, hamstring curl, etc, and it was much better. The power sculpt video isn't horrible, but the section where you sit down on the fanny lifter and get up is hard on my knees - I'm 5'11"" and that's like a kiddie stool.

That and it leaves a lot of muscle groups out. The 3rd is abs sculpt and there is nothing sensational about it - yet the video is long for an ab workout - a waste of time, really.

The videos are just fruity and smiley, the instructors are fake, during some segment, you can see one of them wants to strain, but instead, she smiles in a strained way, like she's constipated... and really the workout is just a gimmick takeoff on prior Firm videos, of course you're going to work on your legs with the lifter - or a staircase, or an elevated Rebok Step, but that's about it - how about some cardio? Then how about a full body strength training workout, then how about some abs and maybe hips or buns or something with some intensity within the same video, instead of kinda ok abs for this length of time. All in all, mediocre.",1108944000,2,2352,4.365296803652968

1790327,4,B00006RCQG,"I bought these tapes about a year ago and have had good results.  If you are a beginner, take your time. You may not be able to get through the complete tape(s) at first.  These are challenging workouts (unless you are exceptionally fit, I suppose) and can easily be adjusted by adding heavier weights as you become stronger.  The instructors are easy to follow and the choreography is fairly simple, even for a klutzy person such as myself.

I actually prefer the stretching sequences here to the ones in the Body Sculpting System 2.  In these videos they do not require you to do stretches while on your knees.

My quibbles:  1.  The instructors usually don't give cues as to how many reps you have to do.  Sometimes they do, but most of the time they don't.  (In System 2, the instructors are much better about giving you an idea of how many reps you will have to do with each exercise.)

2. The person doing the modified exercises is hard to see on occasion.  Most of the time she is visible, but sometimes she is not.

You do not need the Fanny Lifter to get results.  I used the videos for a few months before I had the Fanny Lifter and had good results. If you have really short legs, you can use only  the blue section to do the leg presses.

You will want to keep your remote handy, as the instructors move very quickly from one sequence to the next.",1097366400,5,1359,4.312252964426878
1790328,5,B00006RCQG,"The Body Sculpt workout (with Jennifer Carmen) is worth the price of the set! I have been doing the Firm videos for over a decade, and I still saw results with this tape in only a week! Once I moved up to my heaviest weights, I added a weight belt during the leg workout for added resistance. The music is great, and Jennifer's style is encouraging and upbeat--she is right up there with Tracie Long as one of my favorite instructors! :)",1093564800,2,437,4.341463414634147
1790329,5,B00006RCQG,"I have been using these videos for about 10 weeks now and I must say  that I am very pleased with my results so far. The first few weeks were very difficult, but I perservered and it paid off. Being in my forties and having been inactive for several years, these tapes proved to be quite a challenge. Luckily, I was determined NOT to turn into a marshmallow person and kept using them faithfully. I now look forward to my workouts and the resulting feeling of wellbeing. And yes, you will see a transformation if you do these tapes in rotation. I noticed a difference after 10 workouts, after 10 WEEKS a much more dramatic one though. I can't wait to see myself after 10 more weeks! You really should have a fanny lifter if you want to get the maximum results.",1092096000,3,760,4.352112676056338
1790340,5,B00006RCQG,"I purchased the entire package, along with the fanny lifter, almost two years ago and I am still doing the workouts to this day.  I have even branched out and bought other Firm workouts, which are also very good.  These workouts mark the first time that I have ever been truly challenged by a workout and it is possible to increase the difficulty almost infinitely by using heavier free weights.  The first time I did these workouts I couldn't lower myself onto a chair for a week - that is how intense they are.  But now that I have been doing them for a long time I will never stop.  I even quit going to the gym because the weight training is so effective.  In order for it to be truly effective you need to use heavier weights than what they recommend.  I use 15 and 20 lb free weights with the workouts.  I will use 10 lb weights on some of the shoulder exercised because they are just too difficult to add more.  I don't really recommend the ab workout, though.  Pilates is much better for the abs.
These workouts are an excellent investment!",1078444800,7,1048,4.328205128205128
1790341,2,B00006RCQG,"These new Firm series, are just not challenging enough.  By the end of the tape, I barely worked up a sweat.  It felt as though I wasn't working hard enough.  I much prefer the older Firm series, they are more challenging.  The new Firm series are good for someone who is a beginner.  I swear by the older Firm series.",1075766400,3,318,4.233333333333333
1790342,5,B00006RCQG,"First - you really do need the ""fanny lifter""  I tried doing without it for about a week and then bought it.
I have been doing these for about 3 months and have noticed a significant difference in tone and strength.  There are 3 workouts and I enjoy them all.  The ab workout is about 25 min and is much less intense than the others.  Cardio sculpt is about 55 min. and a great workout.  I like the interval training of aerobics and weights.  Body sculpt is 45 min. This one is my favorite and it has the option to do only lower body or upper body, which is a big plus.  That makes each workout 20-25 min. if you do them individually.  This is well worth the money.",1075075200,10,665,4.10077519379845
1790343,5,B00006RCQG,"I bought this 3-pack because the ""See results in 10 workouts"" guarantee caught my eye.  I thought that was certainly too good to be true, but was bored with the workout videos I already owned.  It took me a while to warm up to these workouts.  I didn't have the Fanny Lifter to start with and tried to substitute my regular step and a heavy kitchen chair, but soon was sold on the Fanny Lifter.  Once that arrived, my FIRM experience was much more pleasant.  It is a little inconvenient to take apart, reassemble, and push the Fanny Lifter out of the way during the workout, but the girls on the tape have to do the same, and after a couple workouts, you'll find you move in sync with them as they transition from one exercise to the other.  I do these workouts on a three-day rotation, six days a week.
  The most intense Upper and Lower Body moves are on Super Body Sculpt.  You'll focus on Lower Body first; expect lots of leg presses and hover squats.  You're either standing or doing squats for this section.  There is no floorwork.  The lower body cool down is the upper body warm-up.  In the Upper Body section, you'll do some push-ups with your hands at different positions on the Fanny Lifter, bicep work, overhead presses, and exercises specifically for your back muscles.  There's a short cooldown stretch at the end, but in all the Firm workouts I've used, they intersperse the stretches with the exercises so you can't skimp on them at the very end.  With the DVD, you can go right to the section you want to work, when you're short on time.
  Cardio Sculpt mixes some of the exercises from Body Sculpt with low-impact cardio.  You don't go into as much detail on each muscle, but this workout is good because you get into a little of that famous FIRM four-limb action, and at the end, you work your abs some.  This workout's a little long (55 minutes), but you get upper, lower, and abs, plus cardio, all in one shot.
  The shortest of the three, Ab Sculpt, features crunches done with the fully-assembled Fanny Lifter, then with the bottom blue section, then with no Fanny Lifter.  You'll work your obliques and lower back muscles as well.  The exercises flow from one, right to the next, so the half hour goes by fast and your abs will feel well-worked.
  Although the beginner modifier doesn't get much camera time in these workouts, you won't be a beginner for long with these workouts, and usually, the only modification is that she's not using weights or is keeping a plyo jump grounded.  You don't need your eyes glued to those modifications to do the workout.
  The great thing about the FIRM videos, especially the newer ones, is that once you have your Fanny Lifter (and Sculpting Stick for the more recent ones), there are a lot of FIRM videos that use that very equipment.  You might have to pick up heavier dumbbells as you progress, but you'll always have a wide array of FIRM workouts to choose from to keep yourself motivated.  collagevideo.com has just about all the FIRM videos known to exist, in case you've exhausted Amazon's offerings.
  P.S. While I don't remember seeing dramatic results after just 10 workouts, I have seen dramatic results after a few months of using FIRM consistently.  I dropped a jeans size, my abs are starting to ripple, and a little muscle popped out on my arm that I didn't even know was there before.  As long as I stick with it, I can only get better results!  I hope you find the same, no matter which workout you choose!",1073779200,14,3486,4.5232
1790344,4,B00006RCQG,"I love this system, I finally found a video that combines strength and cardio, because I cannot afford a gym membership and following magazine strength moves can be confusing if you don't actually see it.  The Firm is very effective, my butt is getting very shapely!!  The only problem I have is that the first few times doing this, the moves cued happen immediately and they don't tell what they will be, so after 5 times, I know what I'll be doing next, but at first you have to stop and realize what they want you to do.
(...) my Fanny Lifter fits perfectly together and taking it apart and moving it out of they way incorporates more squatting and even just a slight, but hurried, break from the strength moves.  Why would you complain?",1067817600,2,740,4.466666666666667
1790345,5,B00006RCQG,I HATE working out - but I love this video set.  I did it once and 2 hours later I wanted to do it again.  I feel the results.  It is great.,1066694400,,140,3.3125
1790346,4,B00006RCQG,"I really love the firm because it includes both weight training and cardio to help you keep your heart healthy and lose pounds while toning and firming (and thereby losing inches).  If you do not have a step of your own, I recommend buying this WITH the fanny lifter (it will save you money in the long run to buy them all together).  If you like this system, you can add the new Body Sculpting System 2 later by going to The Firm's website and getting the videos plus just the sculpting stick (and not the fanny lifter).
The set contains 3 videos - Cardio Sculpt: My favorite, and the one you will do the most.  This contains light to moderate weight training combined with sessions of cardio.  What's great about this is that none of the cardio sessions are so long that you become totally exhausted and the weight sections allow you to catch your breath between cardio sessions.  Allie is also a very good instructor and she includes plenty of modifications for beginners.  I find the cardio in this tape fairly easy.  The only section that I had trouble with was the step section, but after doing the tape 3 or 4 times with no arms, I got it.
Body Sculpt: I really like this one as well.  Jen is the instructor and she does a really great job.  This is a VERY difficult video and includes just sculpting/weight training and no cardio.  The first half is lower body and the second half is upper body - you can choose to do just the first or second half of the video rather than the entire workout.  I actually dislike this aspect because your lower body never recieves a break as it does for Cardio Sculpt - one difficult lower body exercise after another wears me out and makes  me dread this video.
Ab Sculpt: I don't like this one.  It's only 30 minutes long and focuses on abs.  I find it boring and I have only done this video twice since I bought the system.  I substitute other videos that include cardio and abs rather than do this one.  The instructor is Lisa, who is not my favorite Firm instructor.
The only other issue that I have with the tapes is that there is no mention of drinking water and the instructors do not drink water at all (In any of The Firm tapes, from what I can tell).  So, I'm telling everyone now - Drink your water!!  There are also some times where there is not enough time to put down your weights, set up the fanny lifter and then get ready for the next set before the instructor has started on the set.  This can get irritating.  In all, this is a great set.  It would get 5 stars if it were not for the pointlessness of Ab Sculpt.",1066521600,9,2572,4.283643892339544
1790347,4,B00006RCQG,"I bought the VHS version of this pack in March and combined with a proper diet and some other workouts at the gym, this set of workouts has been great!  I've tried other videos in the past that left me loathing working out at home, but I know that when I pop one (or two) of these in, I'm in for some hard but rewarding work!
The only thing I don't like is that sometimes the instructors seem to move a little too quickly from one exercise to the next and you find yourself scrambling to get the fanny lifter into position as well as yourself.  Other than that, these workouts do what they say they do!  In six months I've dropped 40 pounds and four dress sizes and I'm so convinced that these workouts were a large part of that success that I'm ready to buy the new set that just came out!",1064880000,4,790,4.116883116883117
1790348,5,B00006RCQG,"This workout system really works!  Since I've been on it for about 2months i've dropped 4 dress sizes and have really stuck with this system.  It's challenging and the instructors speak to you and encourage you through out the tough sets.  They also show proper from and sweat right along with you. ( yes they sweat and work hard, no cuts done to re-do makeup and make them look flawless)
The workouts are invigorating and target the areas on a woman's figure that we all tend to complain about.  This is truly an investment in a healthy and fit lifestyle.
The Cardio sculpt is thelongest of the three at 55 min.  It is challenging and has low impact aerobics as well as challenging lower and upper body exercises to hit different muscle groups.
The Body Scuplt is more of a weight training program and it will hit your muscles deeper than the carido sculpt.
Ab Sculpt will challeng you lower back and abs and also prepare you to properly breath through the exercises.  The stretches in this tape  are very relaxing.
All in all this is a life changing set of DVDs which are well worth the investment.",1062374400,15,1100,4.525252525252525
1790349,5,B00006RCQG,I purchased the videos in March 2003.  I worked out for a month without the Fannie Lifter.  I agree with another review... you must have the Fannie Lifter to get the best results.  After my Fannie Lifter arrived I was set to build my best body ever! I will be turning 33yrs old this year and decided it was time to get in shape. I used to be athletic and thin before I had children. After having children I blew up and was out of shape.  I've tried other videos through the years and nothing could build muscles for me like this set!  I have muscles and definition that I've never had in my life!  With a (now) healthy diet I've lost 50 pounds since March and feel better than I have in my life!  I thank the Lord for these tapes... they are a God sent to me.,1059091200,4,759,4.053691275167785

1790351,3,B00006RCQG,"I think this is a perfect introduction to the Firm.  But as one review stated if you are new to working out best try something like Kathy Smith.  Also some may not like the moving the box around, picking up different weights, etc. all the time.  All The Firm workouts are long and intense so if you are pressed for time, you might want to subsitute.  BUT The Firm workouts really leave you strong so if you can invest in the time and sweat its well worth it (I'm unemployed right now and addicted to Firm workouts).
However, this set of workouts is definately not as challengeling as many other Firm workouts.  The earlier Firm's are far by one of the most intense workouts I have ever done (besides trying boxing).  The second volume still kicks ...!
I'm not sure why they name one of the DVD's ""Ab Sculpt"" since one can get a better ab workout  in 10 minutes from many pilates moves.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it as there are some core strengthening and stretching moves that leave one exhilirated but I would hardly call it ""Ab Sculpt""
The 'Fanny Lifter' (...) is a great investment.  Those with weak knees should consult theire doctor first or use the lower height steps.",1050192000,22,1178,4.441860465116279

Not only do they get my heart pumping, they offer fairly intensive strength training, particularly the Body Sculpt video.  For over 7 years I've belonged to a gym and just recently I let my membership expire, since I was tired of making the commute. But with these tapes, my 8, 12 & 15 pound free-weights, and the Fanny Lifter, I don't feel as though I'm missing out.  Every time I do one of these workouts, I feel just exhausted enough to know I've put forth a good effort and expended a sufficient amount of energy.  I'm pretty lean, so I didn't purchase these videos to lose weight, but to tone up what I have, and I've been very pleased with the results.  While my weight hasn't changed much, I have a few pairs of pants which definitely feel a bit looser in the waist, and my abs, thighs and upper arms are becoming more sculpted.  I've been using these tapes for 3 months and still love going through the routines on each of them. This is quite a feat for me, since I usually tire of workout videos after one week!

I love that the tape does its cardio and strength training in intervals - (circuit training) and that helps to get you through the long tough workout (the Cardio Sculpt is a 55 min workout). The video does show all of the trainers doing the exercises in different variations and levels but it is hard to see them (all of them, or the beginner guide)doing it as you follow the main instructor. This is okay for me because I'm not new to strength training and exercise, but a true beginner may need more visual of the other levels being worked as you follow along. The only thing I don't like was having to purchase weights to use at home along with the tapes and as  I progress I will have to get heavier weights, but the benefits from using the system will make that pale in comparison.",1046908800,5,1228,4.1991525423728815
1790356,4,B00006RCQG,"This three-pack of workouts includes:
- Cardio Sculpt with Allie DelRio (60 minutes)
- Body Sculpt with Jennifer Carman (50 minutes)
- Ab Sculpt with Lisa Kay (30 minutes)
These workouts require dumbbells and The Firm's Fanny Lifter. For dumbbells, they suggest 3-lb., 5-lb, and 8-lb. weights to start. The Fanny Lifter is a total of 14"" high, so if you have knee problems you may want to work on strengthening your legs before you attempt these workouts. The Fanny Lifter has two parts: one 6"" high, and one 8"" high. Throughout the workouts you use the Fanny Lifter in different combinations, a regular step will not substitute for it.
Each of these DVDs is a challenging workout. If you are new to exercising at home, you may want to start off with something easier, such as Kathy Smith's Personal Trainer Sculpting Workout or Lift Weights to Lose Weight. If you already have a foundation of strength training, these workouts are going to push you further and harder, helping you build muscle and endurance.
The Cardio Sculpt workout runs about 60 minutes. There are no special features on the DVD, only the workout itself. The workout uses 10 - 15 minute segments of strength training, mixed with 2 - 3 minute bursts of low-impact cardio exercises. The strength training includes every area of your body: lots of squats for the lower body, push-ups for the chest as part of the warm-up, 4 minutes of non-stop sit-ups for the abs, and the tricep French press. There is a 4-minute warm-up and a closing stretch. Throughout the workout, Allie guides you through stretching out the muscle groups that you just worked. This is an excellent combination of tried-and-true muscle conditioning and sound exercise principles.
These three workouts will help you to tone and condition your body. The manufacturer also guarantees ""visible results in 10 workouts."" Bear in mind that you have to alternate muscle groups. You cannot do total body strength training every day. So be sure to alternate lower body with upper body, or vary your routine with cardio workouts on your ""off"" days.",1046131200,83,2076,4.88385269121813

The Fanny Lifter is the key to The Firm's success. Without the Fanny Lifter, The Firm is a typical cardio+toning workout that can be purchased at a much cheaper price. The 14"" (6"" + 8"") step is higher than any stepper that I've ever used doing step aerobics. I felt the ""good hurt"" in my hips and inner/outer thighs after the very first workout. After several workouts I began to feel the difference in jeans, though I still have a ways to go to reduce by derriere. I'm also gaining definition in my arms. As long as I continue to see results with The Firm, I don't plan on renewing my gym membership.
The Firm isn't perfect. Each video shows participants at various levels. In each video not enough camera time is given to the beginner. If you purchase the DVD it lacks scene selection. The only way to return to a segment of workout is to rewind it just like a VCR. The plus over a VCR - three workouts (cardio, upper body, abs) appear on one DVD. Finally, I wouldn't purchase the DVD or tape without buying (or already owning) the Fanny Lifter.",1044403200,14,1254,4.4094827586206895

1790369,5,B00006RCQG,"I have about 20-25 work-out tapes, my first being Jane Fonda's very first one. Of all the work-out tapes I have, The Firm is the best. I have several of the older ones, and while they are different from the new ones, I still think the new work out is tough and very effective. I have been telling people about The Firm for years, and those that have tried it agree, they are tough, but that's the only way to get results. I would recommend this workout to anyone. One of the best things about The Firm, is there isn't alot of instruction that you have to get thru at the beginning. You just learn it as you go, and everytime you do it, it gets easier and easier. Because if you are doing a work-out several times a week, you don't want to see the instruction everytime, and that's what I like about The Firm. It's still the best around. By the way, I'm from the South, and don't have any trouble understanding the instructors.",1043539200,3,926,4.267045454545454
1790370,4,B00006RCQG,"While I only have 4 of the other FIRM tapes, I have to say that I was not impressed with them.  The work outs are great, yes, but the mixing in from other tapes.. the roman-isc scenery and music.. The stepford personas and fake smiles..No thank you! I was SO happy to find that the new ones are just that - NEW! One instructor all the way through, a simple background and a great, no-nonsense workout! I've just started using these new ones and will never go back to the older ones.",1043020800,8,482,4.239130434782608
1790371,5,B00006RCQG,I've owned many excercise video's but the only ones's comparable to going to the gym are the Firm tapes. What more could you ask for? Cardio and weights. That's all I need. I really don't care about the music. All I care about is results.  Yes I agree with some of the reviewers that some of the songs and moves are repetitious..but...MY FANNY IS FIRMER!! So who cares about it. I don't particulary do excercise videos for fun I want to be in pain and sweat hard. So if you're buying the Firm tapes just for fun you're better off excercising to a Gloria Estefan C.D.. So there.,1041811200,8,577,4.342592592592593
1790372,5,B00006RCQG,"I'm not an athlete or even a person who exercises often.  I bought these tapes to lose weight and they are absolutely wonderful!!  They are super challenging and I can feel ""the burn"" while exercising with the Firm's master instructors.  It took me about a week before I could actually complete the entire workout.  For a beginner, the moves are difficult to keep up with on the CardioSculpt.  Especially for someone like me who is not real coordinated.  But, the instructors are very good about telling you what to do next, before you actually do it and how many counts of each move to do.  Once you get the hang of the moves, it is very easy to follow! It took me about a week to be able to keep up, but it was well worth it.  I have had the system for about 2 weeks and am following the rotation calendar suggested by the instructors.  It is definitely not boring.  It is designed so that a beginner could use it as well as someone who is much more advanced.  The more advanced, the more weight you use and even on some of the moves, the instructors show you how to do more advanced moves and for beginners, they show moves that are easier.  It is a GREAT workout!!!  Definitely your moneys worth!!",1041638400,14,1201,4.331838565022421
1790373,5,B00006RCQG,"I LOVE these tapes!  The Bodysculpt is the best with Jenn Carman.  Even though they market this as a sculpting tape I was breathing heavily throughout the entire workout so I think it is a cardio workout as well.  YOU will not waste your money and time if you buy these tapes.  I highly recommend you get the Fanny Lifter step that you can buy as a set with these tapes.
My muscles ache for days after each workout.  I sweat more than when I do the treadmill.  I have been doing the Firm tapes for about 15 years, even though I stopped here and there.  These tapes are GREAT!  I don't get bored with them unlike all the other tapes that I use only once.",1041638400,7,653,4.126984126984127

1790376,3,B00006RCQG,"These tapes are awesome. I do like the new firm tapes.  I get a nice workout.  My favorite is Cardio Sculpt.  Allie is a great instructor.  Ab sculpt is the tape i use the most and I don't think its worth more than 10 dollars. Though I do like Lisa Kay, this workout is just boring.  Now these new tapes aren't like the old firm videos. The background is really really boring and so are their costumes.  And the instructors don't face the crowd like the old ones.  The music isn't that motivating either.  I own about 30 excersize videos and they all have the same songs on them.  The older firm tapes had different music, which made them stand out even more.
All in all, these tapes are fun and challenging.  But if you want something more exciting and different you might want to get the older firm tapes.  They are truely the best on the market.",1040083200,15,848,4.30379746835443

7972825,5,B00006RCQG,"I originally used this firm workout about 15 years ago on VHS and ruined my cassettes. When I found these DVD sets it was really nice to get back to the workout program that started me on my exercise journey. The cardio is moderate and low impact so there's no knee damage. My favorite part though is when I get to pickup my hand weights....and the sweat starts pouring out! I love this particular FIRM series because its not fancy, its not fashionable, its simply the best workout I've ever used. Truthfully. In the first 10 workouts, you do see results. First you'll notice you feel stronger, and suddenly you'll be getting dressed and notice how your shoulders are getting defined. Followed by your hips developing a curve that only muscle and strength can provide. With the multiple weight's (starting 3, 5, and 8) you are able to increase the weight as you get stronger and the better you get, you can increase the weight specifically to focus on a part that needs developing.
