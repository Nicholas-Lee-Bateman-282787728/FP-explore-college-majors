2958760,4,B000VZC4NU,"It was great that we got all the seasons of this fun show. Too bad the studios don't do that for all the shows they start. I got the first two seasons from Canada, so I don't know what they did, but the only disappointing thing about season three is that there is no episode discription in or on the box. And this season has some of the episodes we all remember.
A good fun reminder of Stephen Cannel's car chase show and one of the best of the buddy shows. Worth watching.",1195603200,2,473,4.096774193548387
2958761,5,B000VZC4NU,"Fans of this show were told explicitly some time ago that this series would be never be released on DVD. Well! Fortunately, something was worked out and here we are, to the delight of hundreds of original fans and even more new ones.

VEI has done a marvellous job of retaining all the original music (and there was a _lot_ of it), of restoring old ""source material"", of including a short photo gallery. Unfortunately, due to a printers' error, the DVD insert was left out, but you can get one to print out by contacting me by email. The insert includes the episode guide, some trivia info, a few photos. The STAR for Brian Keith group was mentioned briefly on the insert and we were sent a copy to approve and now VEI has agreed to allow us to share it with anyone who's bought the DVD. Just email me offline about it, or contact any of us at the starforbrian site.

Then, settle in for a great ride with the judge and the ex-con!",1194307200,2,931,4.314285714285714

8220626,5,B000VZC4NU,"I was too busy to watch this show on its original run--but fell in love with it through reruns.  The relationship between Hardcastle & McCormick makes the show good no matter the age.  There's the mandatory ""car chase"" in each episode.  And it's absolutely the 1980s.",1393200000,,267,4.760869565217392
8220627,1,B000VZC4NU,I thought I ordered a New copy of Hardcastle and McCormick Third season. What I got was a used open copy with all the disks a little beat up.,1387411200,,141,3.896551724137931
8220628,5,B000VZC4NU,HARDCASTLE AND MCCORMICK  IS ONE THE BEST SHOWS THAT I HAVE SEEN . I LOVE BRIAN KIETH  BUT I LOVE THE CAR. THIS DVD BOX SET IS ONE TO OWN.,1352851200,,138,3.566666666666667
8220629,5,B000VZC4NU,This show brings back so many great memories! I wish I could have all the episodes! Thank you so much!,1352419200,,102,4.15
8220630,5,B000VZC4NU,MY HUSBAND AND I ENJOYED THESE EPISODES EVERY DAY AND WERE SORRY TO SEE THEM END. GREAT PROGRAMS,1263081600,,96,4.388888888888889
8220631,4,B000VZC4NU,I loved the Hardcastle and McCormick series growing up. I was thrilled when they finally came out with them. I got the first two seasons right away when they were available and waited patiently for the third and final season. I finally recieved it for Christmas and I was a little disappointed that the box it came in was a little cheaper looking than the previous two seasons. It also has all 5 disks in one plastic multi disk box and comes with no book describing the episodes like the other two seasons did. The menu layout is nicer however and the episodes are just as great as the other two seasons so if you can get passed the cheap packaging you will still enjoy the shows as much as ever. I just don't think Amazon should be charging $50 for this set when we were able to buy the other two seasons for less and had better packaging. Thats the only reason for the 4 stars.,1202601600,,879,4.269461077844311
8220632,5,B000VZC4NU,"The packaging for this 3rd season of Hardcastle & McCormick is downright shoddy, but that's not the fault of Amazon.  The purchasing experience and delivery of the product was great.  Many thanks.",1202428800,,196,5.09375
8220633,5,B000VZC4NU,"This is my favorite show. It is the chemistry between Mark & Milt that lifts it above the average car-chase, good guy/bad guy type show and makes it a pleasure to watch. I wish there had been more seasons. Anyway, thank you VEI for releasing all of the seasons and doing it right. If you want to see the best show from the 80's, buy this (and the first and second season too)!",1199923200,,376,4.164383561643835
8220634,5,B000VZC4NU,"Others have posted excellent reviews of this great 80's series, so I'll not rehash the same territory. I would however like to thank VEI, the company responsible for releasing this series. Here's why:

Contains all the music as originally broadcast!
They released all three seasons quickly!

Those who have had the misfortune to purchase other DVD releases of classic ""Stephen J. Cannell"" series (Hunter, 21 Jump Street, The Greatest Amrican Hero, etc.) will know that Anchor Bay basically -RUINED- these series by altering the music or editing whole scenes out of the show!! Honestly, some episodes have been CHOPPED TO PIECES because Anchor Bay didn't want to pay for the music rights!

VEI has shown that it's not only possible to obtain the music rights, but it's the RIGHT THING TO DO! If they were able to do this for Hardcastle and McCormick, there is NO REASON that Anchor Bay shouldn't have been able to do the same for the other titles!

Do you even realize how lucky we are to have ALL THREE seasons of Hardcastle and McCormick? There are other series, like T.J. Hooker, Night Court, Simon and Simon, (and MANY others), that had MAJOR television runs, and yet the DVD releasing studio REFUSES to release further seasons! Just remember that when a DVD releasing studio makes the statement, ""further seasons will not be released because of poor sales"", they're actually saying, ""sorry, we're just too GREEDY"".

VEI has shown that it's not only possible to release ALL SEASONS (quickly), but it's also possible to release them UNEDITED. I will buy ANY future release from VEI without hesitation. Thanks for caring VEI! fans of 80's entertainment (such as myself) truly appreciate it!

Any chance that you can make a deal to re-release the other Cannell titles properly? I'd be happy to throw my Anchor Bay releases into the trash and buy them from you instead!

P.S.

Anyone else notice that the ""Coyote X"" starting in season two is actually a different car than in season one? Also, two slightly different versions of the SAME ""new"" theme song for season two. Check out Mark watching that Bangles video in season two also! :)
