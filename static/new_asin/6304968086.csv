The tape itself is densely packed with simple concepts, but these simple concepts are not present in the instruction of most martial artists. He does a thorough job. Bravo!",1048118400,2,277,4.791666666666667
7882045,4,6304968086,"All martial arts make a ""mission statement"" of sorts. For example:
1) Judo: If you push I'll pull, and vice versa. I'll add my power to yours, so it won't matter if you're stronger, you'll still fall down.
2) Ju-Jitsu: forget Judo, this is not a sport, I'll break your arm as you fall, just to be on the safe side.
3) Aikido: I'm a pacifist, so if you break your arm as you fall, it is  really your own fault because you have violated the harmony of the cosmos . . .
4) Boxing: Try and hit me and I will dance around you, find weaknesses and methodically grind you into dust.
5) Karate: Try anything and I'll hit you so (expletive deleted) hard that I'll send you flying. Then I'll step over your corpse and invade Manchuria.
6) Tae Kwon Do: Any resemblance between karate and TKD is purely coincidental, our art is zillions of years old.
7)Kung Fu= Ha! TKD is to Kung Fu what pop music is to Mozart.
Etc.
Which brings us to Silat, and its 'mission statement'= What if he's got a knife?
Developed in the jungles of Indonesia--where folks usually carried knives on their belt--Silat is fast, applied geometry.
 Up close and predicated on the notion that you won't have time to 'put 'em up'.  Even though , like other Ma's, it defends against punches, kicks and grabs--the movements won't make much sense without the knowledge that its main focus is anticipating a surprise attack from close range, usually against a blade.
In this video Guru Plinck does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating the basic principles of this little known art.
 Silat may well have been the 'ancestor art' of Philipino Kali.
Some LEO's (law enforcement officers) are beginning to adopt Silat principles, most notably the 'wedge' style of closing in.
 And the last time I heard Marc mc Young, dean of the 'been there done that school of fighting'
(*serious plug: Marc's books are available ...as are those of Geoff Thompson, Peyton Quinn the others who've had real world experience---get them! )
He was currently studying Silat with Guru Plinck. It would seem as if the 'smart money' is starting to take a very close look at this art.",1046736000,10,2121,4.58575197889182
7882046,4,6304968086,"Steven Plinck ,a Washington based pentjak silat instructor, explains and demonstates the principles and concepts of this esoteric system .While not a technique loaded video , he spends alot of time succesfully explaining and demonstrating how the laws of the body and leverage are taken advantage of in this style of silat .One believes him when he says that it was developed for smaller people fighting larger people. This tape was definitely well worth the time and money; I'm just surprised that he never produced any more.",1018396800,5,526,5.057471264367816
7882047,4,6304968086,"For those who have the slightest idea about what knife fighting is all about, this video is for you. Mr. Plinck is a very professional Silat practitioner that introduces his very stylized martial art, then goes on to show the finer points of Silat & how the knife is implemented into this strangely effective art. Excellent video on Silat. I also recommend Steve Gartin's video.",1013990400,2,378,4.8307692307692305
