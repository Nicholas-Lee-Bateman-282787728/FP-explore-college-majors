My face hurt from laughing...I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD since Comedy Central cut out alot of funny stuff.  My favorite is Christian Rap..

4046668,5,B0030U1TUC,"I immediately followed her on Twitter after watching this.  Have since watched this comedy special about 3 times since the first time I watched it and still laugh out loud at different parts each time.

4046684,5,B0030U1TUC,"Anjelah Johnson's stand-up special was first on Comedy Central, then I found the DVD. This dvd has even more that you didn't see on Comedy Central and is definitely worth the money. She is outrageously funny and isn't too far out there. She doesn't have a lot of inappropriate material so almost everyone can enjoy her show (unless you only like inappropriate).

4046688,5,B0030U1TUC,"I'm always looking for female standup comics to enjoy, and Anjelah Johnson is one of the best of the best of the women in that business.

""That's How We Do It"" was recorded at the Verizon Theater in Houston. It is Anjelah's debut standup album with a major label. Every minute of this show is full of energy and wild humor. Anjelah is a former professional cheerleader for the Oakland Raiders, and it is a humorously unexpected choice for a woman this gorgeous to perform standup routines based in self-deprecation. She pulls off that schtick brilliantly. One of her specialties is to do imitations of the accents of various ethnic groups, both males and females. She's dead on and howlingly funny at it.

In her opening riff, she describes herself as half Mexican and half Native American. She says that people ask her all the time, with that heritage, how did she end up with a surname like Johnson? After the audience waits a beat to hear some kind of explanation, she shrugs and says, she has no idea--to great laughter. And *then* she launches on a series of colorful stories about living with a totally unexpected last name. This is the flow of her stories on this album:

1. What's Up Houston?
2. My Name
3. Growing Up Poor
4. Married Couples
5. Technology
6. Nosey Sister
7. Sneak Into A Club
8. Oakland Raiders
9. Nail Salon
10. Blue Shirt
11. Head Nod
12. Big Butt
13. That's How We Do It
14. Church
15. Roscoes
16. Karate
17. Kill 'Em With Kindness
18. Hollywood Homeless
19. New Car
20. Valet
21. Southwest Airlines
22. Beat Freaks Intro
23. Family Oriented
24. Fortune Cookie
25. Dating Habits
26. Christian Rap
27. Talking To Married Couples
28. Meet Tia Mary

If you are looking for a wonderful time, filled with hysterical laughter, you couldn't do better than this talented comedian.",1362441600,,1800,4.598130841121495

4046690,5,B0030U1TUC,"At first I only bought this because my favorite dance crew ""The Beat Freaks"" were performing in this, but as I watched through, I found myself really laughing at the jokes and relating to them in some way.",1356739200,,205,4.421052631578948

4046693,5,B0030U1TUC,"My friend knows how much I LOVE anything that has to do with comedy. Especially stand-up comedy. I'm not a big fan of female comedians though. From what I've seen, I only like Anjelah Johnson, Whitney Cummings, Chelsea Lately/Handler, and Natasha Legerro.

I watched this, not expecting much, but I was very surprised! For 40 minutes straight, I think this was very funny! The remaining 19 minutes were pretty funny too. A lil less, but still funny. After seeing this, she's now my 2nd fav female comedian.

It doesn't hurt that she's good looking too :).",1334448000,,555,4.770833333333333

4046696,3,B0030U1TUC,"Simply put, she is hilarious! It was only 10 minutes into the show on Comedy Central and I knew I had to have a copy so I bought two...one for me and one for a friend.  My favorite comedians are George Lopez, Freddie Soto, Pablo Francisco, Brian Regan, Chris Rock, Dom Irrera and now Anjelah Johnson.  She is a rising star.  All of her material is original and she can take ordinary mundane life circumstances and make you fall down laughing.  Everything she says is funny but true.  You will enjoy this video and watch it over and over again.",1318982400,,543,4.39
4046697,3,B0030U1TUC,"Anjelah Johnson delivers a few good laughs in the comedy special. She still needs to work on her comedic timing as some of her bits suffer from lack of activity. But, this talented performer is an excellent mimic and has good material. I expect to see her become more popular as she's attractive and funny. If you like comedy concerts this DVD is worthy of your collection.",1301616000,,373,4.582089552238806

Anjelah is hilarious and a rarity; as it's hard to find a funny, clean, female comedian.  She brings her experiences with dating (though she's now married), cheering for the Oakland Raiders, a little bit of beatboxing, and the infamous Nail Salon joke to this DVD.  I also love her dance routine at the end.",1490313600,,482,4.494252873563219
