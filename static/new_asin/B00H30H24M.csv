8629344,5,B00H30H24M,"I'm in ongoing physical therapy for hip flexor tendonitis and periformis syndrome.  My PT recommended somatic exercises and I found Hanna's book and Knight's video.  Knight's video has been especially helpfuls as the lower extremity exercises are exactly what I needed for my conditions.  Additionally, I am gaining flexibility which should help prevent re-injury to my hip flexor and periformis. The exercises quickly relieve acute pain, but like other physical therapy/conditioning methods, it takes time to get one's body in balance. Miraculous stuff that worked when typical PT hasn't.",1514246400,,589,5.595505617977528
8629345,5,B00H30H24M,I can't believe I didn't already post a review! I suffered with Chronic pain endless Chiropractor visits (I have been diagnosed with Scoliosis) though regular exercise helped I still had severe pain that lasted weeks at times. Out of sheer desperation I purchased this dvd after reading up on Somatic exercise. After the first day I was actually very sore but after three day's I was PAIN FREE! I was and still am amazed at how well this works! I tell everyone I know! So grateful that I can finally live pain free w/o medication! I have found if I sustain a regular practice of a minimum of 1 day a week (for an hour practice of G.S.Y.) I am pain free and never worry any longer about how to resolve my back pain and how I will ever pay for all those Chiropractor visits... all a thing of the past! Thank God and Somatic Yoga my pain is gone!,1486512000,5,843,4.275
8629346,5,B00H30H24M,I purchased this to go along with James Knight's first dvd.  It is an excellent addition without being repetitive.  I'm currently rotating through the sessions - they are about 20-25 minutes each - which fits my busy schedule.  Who are these people who have an hour or two a day for yoga?  I'm not one of them.,1465171200,3,310,4.385964912280702
8629347,5,B00H30H24M,"Fabulous! I've suffered with chronic neck and back pain for years. Tried acupuncture, PT, chiropractic adjustments, massage, pain patches, even drugs.... nothing has helped as much as these yoga moves. Can't thank you enough!!!",1464220800,7,227,5.705882352941177
8629348,5,B00H30H24M,I absolutely love this DVD. For stretching and relaxation it is incredible.,1455321600,,75,5.333333333333333
8629349,5,B00H30H24M,Gentle Somatic Yoga w/James Knight is a great addition to my yoga practice. After less than two weeks of practice I have noticed reduction of pain in my trouble spots (neck/shoulders from desk working). The alleviation of pain and increased flexibility has contributed greatly to my regular yoga and other exercise practices. An unexpected and welcome bonus of Knight's teaching style is that he provides equally detailed verbal instructions along with the visual.  This allows the practitioner to concentrate inward to notice what is happening in the body. As a long-time practitioner of walking meditation I find this CD also provides a meditative experience for those of us who enjoy mindfulness meditation through movement and breathing. I highly recommend somatic yoga practice and Knight specifically for those who are looking to enhance their existing practice or begin a new practice (of course checking with one's physician first).,1452902400,7,940,5.394557823129252
