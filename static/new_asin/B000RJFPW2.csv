8200999,5,B000RJFPW2,"I bought a new DVD player that will play both PAL and NTSC DVD's. I read that SHED productions has no desire to make the DVD's in NTSC format which is what the US/Canada DVD players are. If you love this series invest the money because there will be more foreign films you may wish to view. Funny how only season one is offered in NTSC format. I guess just to wet the appetite of US and Canadian viewers.

(The character development is wonderful. Gives you insights into the various levels of society. Whomever picked the actors/actresses for the parts was spot on. Each role is completely believeable.) Bad Girls introduced viewers to the world of female inmates inside HMP Larkhall. Of course all drama's need corrupt officers, vivid story lines, tragic and sweet lives, strong bonds between not only prisoners but among some of the staff as well. You will laugh and may shed a tear or two.
I have really enjoyed this entire series. As soon as my friends buy an all region DVD player I know many will buy this entire series first.",1280966400,2,1032,4.548387096774194
8201000,5,B000RJFPW2,"They continue the great multi-contributable writing from many people to keep this series jumping and twisting.
I understand they are going to make this series in the US. I wish them luck, but you can't replace these great accents and attitude. I am glad I saw the original series 1-3, but I believe one of the main stories of Nicki and Helen has ended in series 3- contractual disputes. Oh well. It is hard when you get used to seeing some strong main characters- because of Bad Girls, I also watched Wire in the Blood, where Simone Lahbib ended up eventually. Fell in love with Robson Green's character. Another series they are going to try to do in US too. The UK is much better about producing in depth characters from actors instead of flooding the screen with models that act.",1268697600,,781,4.546099290780142
8201001,5,B000RJFPW2,"Can't get enough of ""Bad Girls"". The disks arrived quickly and all are in like-new condition.",1252713600,,93,4.875
8201002,5,B000RJFPW2,"The first three seasons of Bad Girls are wonderful.  Let's hope Shed Productions will produce a Region One format so all of us in the USA and Canada can enjoy it.  Bad Girls is an atypical depiction of life in a British prison where some lovable and some nasty characters are coping with life behind bars.  The story lines are entertaining, poignant and sometimes painful but always well developed and mostly believable.  Once you start watching, you will be hooked by their humor, pathos, pain and will to survive.",1199664000,8,515,4.752808988764045
