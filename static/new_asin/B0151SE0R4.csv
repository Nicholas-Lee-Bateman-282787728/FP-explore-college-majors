7425417,5,B0151SE0R4,"Kimberly Parkers Lost in Sound: A One Woman Play is an amazing story about life and the journey into hearing loss and back out again.  Her courage to share the deep vulnerable challenges along with her talent in portraying the numerous roles of the individuals along the journey is very impressive.  I appreciate the humor, authenticity and valuable information that is dispersed throughout. Kimberly effectively shares her gift of drama on stage and the woman she has become is very inspiring.",1444608000,,494,5.08641975308642
7425418,5,B0151SE0R4,"Thank Goodness for digital technology! Without it, we wouldnt have the assistive technologies that draw hearing-impaired people out of social and emotional isolation, into aural rehabilitation, into full participation in their families and communities. Digital technology also brings us DVDs  and this beauty by author, actress, and educator Kimberly Parker.  LOST IN SOUND: A ONE WOMAN PLAY is a heart-rending journey with one hearing-impaired person through decades of progressive hearing loss.

The play is moving, not just in the I laughed and I cried sense. I recognized the ring of truth  the story of a bright young woman who was able to compensate for her disability through childhood and college years, into years of marriage and raising a son. The story is as gripping as a punch in the gut. (Yes! There is strong language!) Kimberly is talented as an actress and a story-teller. We experience with her the embarrassment and awkward humor of communication breakdowns. We suffer through the resulting years of depression, fear, and guilt. We rejoice when she chooses to live life to the fullest and takes advantage of assistive technologies that are available. Kimberlys energy jumps off the screen! She seamlessly shifts from scene to scene, from a tent on a lonely mountain top to an intensive care unit. Kimberly portrays a wide range of people, from a hidebound astronomy teacher to Kimi the child who dreams of a rewarding future.

Filming of LOST IN SOUND: A ONE WOMAN PLAY took place Downstairs at Town Hall in Seattle, in January 2015. The venue is as important as the play itself. The auditorium is fully-wired with hearing loop technology! Check on-line for Hearing Loops at Town Hall Seattle. An historic building was renovated so the facilities would be accessible for hearing-impaired people.

I recommend this DVD to families, teachers and guidance counselors. This story is a valentine for any family that has overcome  or is just becoming aware of - hearing loss or other communication disability.",1444608000,2,2022,5.127659574468085
7425419,5,B0151SE0R4,"LOST IN SOUND is a heart warming and emotionally stirring account of Kimberly Parker's journey through a life long struggle with hearing loss.  Her story is one who anyone experiencing hearing loss will be able to identify with and feel encouraged by; if you don't have personal experience with hearing loss, you will learn more about the reality of this issue and how it affects everyone who comes in to contact with a person living without hearing. Kimberly, an accomplished actor despite her hearing challenges, skillfully and professionally acts out her story with humor and honesty that is both educational and entertaining. In addition, if you are an individual who is a candidate for and considering the possibility of using a COCHLEAR IMPLANT to treat your hearing loss, Kimberly Parker is an example of a person who has received positive results with this device and is more than willing to share her experience and knowledge with anyone looking for hearing loss support.",1442966400,,980,5.049382716049383
7425420,5,B0151SE0R4,"Lost in Sound: A One Woman Play by Kimberly Parker, is an excellent performance by the artist, as well as being quite unique.  First, it is a rendering of the playwrights own journey through hearing loss, told with both sensitivity and humora subject rarely seen on the stage. Next, it contains statistics and facts gained through Parkers graduate work at Washington D.C.s Gallaudet Universitythe school for the deaf and hard of hearing. This is information valuable to all, as it enlightens not only those who are hard of hearing, but everyone with whom they come in contact.

In addition, Parkers impressive theatrical skills make viewing this play a joy as she makes it easy for us to absorb new information while raising our awareness about what it feels like to be hard of hearing in our society.",1442361600,2,801,4.839416058394161
7425421,5,B0151SE0R4,"Incredible! Educational, plus captions included makes this accessible for all. Strong, clear voice. Kimberly is a lovely woman and her story is told so beautifully, not to mention what a great advocate and representative she is. Gives such great insight to what it is like living with a hearing loss. I would recommend this in schools! I would recommend this overall...GOOD WORK.",1449100800,,379,5.129032258064516
7425422,5,B0151SE0R4,"I saw Kimberly Parker perform this play in Seattle.  It was both informative and entertaining.  She portrays scenes from her life, unfolding the understanding that she has hearing loss and how it impacts her life.  I was totally engrossed for her entire performance.  I strongly recommend this play for viewing.",1448582400,,311,5.16
7425423,5,B0151SE0R4,"I've watched this performance twice. This DVD is now part of my permanent collection.  It will be a ""go to"" when I crave inspiration and a great treasure to loan others as they, too, face challenges.  Humor, facts, personal stories with a well-spun dramatic performance weave an entertaining experience.  Then, with reflection, I realize how carefully selected and threaded each moment is in creating a universal message.  Only when each one of us believes ourselves important can any one of us nurture our dreams and dreams of all members of society.  We need others, want others and CAN be a part of the universe.  But first, we must believe in ourselves.
Thanks to all that made this dream a reality to be shared.

7425424,5,B0151SE0R4,"A true hero's journey! A woman who is standing in her truth and giving herself grace through the struggle and standing strong for others with disabilities. Kimberly is a gift from God and the deaf community, thanks for sharing your story and vulnerability it's remarkable.",1446076800,,272,5.066666666666666
7425425,5,B0151SE0R4,"I had to pleasure to watch this short but powerful and informative one woman play recently.  Kimberly is able to share the confusion and frustration of growing up with undetected and untreated hearing loss.  She then goes on to share the perceptions of her hearing loss to those around her from her mother, sister, son, husband and even a college professor.  Kimberly's work really drives home the impact that hearing loss has on the entire community and in the end Kimberly also educates us as to what we need to look for, within ourselves and our loved ones.  I walked away with a sense of hope that experiencing hearing loss can open the doors for us to learn new ways to communicate, technologies that are available and most of all providing love and support to those around us (and ourselves) if we find ourselves in such a predicament.  Kimberly also shows us how our personal challenges do not have to drag us down.  Kimberly has accomplished so much and the fact that she wants to bring awareness and hope to others with her message is nothing short of inspiring.",1445904000,,1071,4.64021164021164
7425426,5,B0151SE0R4,"This play makes one aware of the difficulties and limits that hearing impaired people live with, and the loneliness and isolation caused by not being able to fully participate in ""typical"" life due to hearing loss. Kimberly Parker uses both humor and drama to tell her story, so there is variety and interest.",1445731200,,309,4.849056603773585
7425427,5,B0151SE0R4,"An incredible performance and story in which she brilliantly weaves different family perspectives and ages all while showcasing her remarkable talent.  Kimberly's story is emotional, triumphant and inspiring.",1445731200,,208,6.428571428571429
7425428,5,B0151SE0R4,"This true heartfelt story with Kims journey and discoveries about how she unlocked pain, confusion and hearing loss are poetic genius! Bravo for the insight, talent and courage it took for her to step into her lifes purpose! With Passion! With Results! It not only speaks volumes (pun intended!) to the issues facing hearing loss, for those who have it, those who live with those who have it, but to the masses, with many of lifes pressing issues, which does affect us ALL! Thank you Kim for having the Leadership to bring this life changing video to the world for awareness, education, and simply making the world a better place for all to dwell, live, love, share, connect, and Thrive together!

7425429,5,B0151SE0R4,"I want to give my highest recommendation to the play Lost In Sound. It is a fabulous tale of one persons journey through life on a search, on a quest, for the key to unlock her fullest potential. That journey is one, which we are all on, and all seeking for.  She found the missing key and shares the celebration of wholeness that she has found so far in this part of her journey. This DVD will inspire you on your quest to live your fullest life through the thick and thin of things.  It will bring you resilience of spirit!",1445299200,,525,4.188118811881188

8732292,5,B0151SE0R4,"I didn't think I needed to watch this play.  My hearing is fine.  How selfish.  As I watched it I realized, wow this is my dad. This is my dad's friends.  This is my friend's mom.  About three quarters of the way through, tears started rolling down my face. This is my 24 year old son! MY SON. At age 5 he was diagnosed with 60% hearing loss on one side and 90% on the other. He had several surgeries between then and age 12.  Some annual check-ups and then I forgot about it.  As I watched this video it occurred to me, his sister, his dad, his girlfriend all complain that he doesn't listen to them.  I say, ""He has a hearing problem, he's not ignoring you on purpose"". I say that...and do nothing! He has an appointment next week to see his ENT doctor.  Thank you Kimberly for sharing your amazing experience.",1458604800,,812,4.220779220779221
8732293,5,B0151SE0R4,I was moved and brought to a new awareness.,1457049600,,43,3.888888888888889
8732294,5,B0151SE0R4,Kimberly did an amazing job capturing her journey through hearing loss and showing the affect it had on her entire family.  Points were made that I never would have thought of if I had not seen this DVD.  I now have a great appreciation for the hearing impaired and realize just how many obstacles they need to overcome.  I also have amazing respect for a friend who has raised her hearing impaired daughter in such a way that we never thought of it as a disability.  We were shown what was necessary from us in order for her daughter to understand us clearly.  I can now see that without her educating us her daughter would have missed out on so much.  Thank you for the awareness Kimberly!,1456185600,,691,4.4015748031496065

8732296,5,B0151SE0R4,"I was moved and inspired by Kimberly Parker and her life's journey as depicted in her play.  Her talent as a performer drew me in.  The multitude of different characters portrayed were each so clearly represented, it was as if there was another performer playing the part.  Her performance gave me a new awareness of the challenges of the hearing impaired and of the isolation from human connections. The strength Kim has to overcome her challenges is inspiring for anyone with any obstacle in life.",1456185600,,499,4.847058823529411
8732297,5,B0151SE0R4,"This performance is riveting to see many perspectives of a woman and a family dealing with hearing loss and deafness.  It is powerful for me to hear that a blind person can stay really connected with others using their other senses; however, one with hearing loss gets shut into their own world.

The most profound was to realize this happening in my family with my 93 year old grandmother who raised 6 boys, all a year apart, by herself.  Her disability?  Her hearing and watching her struggle with this (AND WHY ON EARTH ARE THESE FOLKS DISABILITY COVERED BY INSURANCE?) to continue on living in her home on her own, and this is her only true health ailment.  All the while losing her memories to dementia and I do believe is simply because of HEARING LOSS.

Bless Kimberly for stepping out bravely and courageously to bring awareness to this cause!",1456099200,,851,4.64

She takes you through her journey of not even knowing she had hearing loss and how that impacted her relationship with herself and those around her.  Beautiful peice of art by a beautiful soul.
