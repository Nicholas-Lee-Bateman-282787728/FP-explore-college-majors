6243484,5,B00HYZ11R0,"A fascinating BBC intellectual and entertaining look at the historical origins of medicine. Film drama and novel plots often focus on this topic with raved results. We all use medicines and the history is as astonishing as sci-fiction. This documentary uses archival footage, photos, reenactment, and interview to demonstrate the dangers encountered in historic medicine inventions. Herbal to synthetic--a 200 yr trek. Narrator Dr. Mosley samples/tests many of the dangerous drugs in front of the camera. Don't try this at home. ""Blimey, wow.""
Not just for health care workers. Something for everyone with the rapid health changes taking place.

SDH SUBTITLES provided.
~~~~1-PAIN: Definition and control is looked into. Pain's history, as well as past attempts at remedy. But with discoveries like morphine comes new problems of addiction. Nitrous oxide is a humorous segment of this episode. Heroin & aspirin were accidents. The Mickey Finn quite intentional.
~~~~2-PUS: Better than the unfortunate title implies. Medieval practices concerning infection began improvement in early 20th century. Microbes' awareness was the answer. Smallpox. Plague. TB. Gangrene. Typhoid. Syphilis. Spanish Flu. Germ theory saved millions. Bacteria war. Penicillin's WWII story. Antibiotic bliss-till viruses visited.
~~~~3-POISON: It can become treatment. When a killer substance turns cure. Curare, a poison, proved to be muscle relaxant, thus a modern surgery aid. Arsenic, Victorian murder favorite, spurs the pharmacy industry. The ""chemist's war"" of WWI. Mustard gas transforms into 1st drug cancer treatment [chemo]. Medicine can become poison too, such as Germany's thalidomide. Botox = the worst poison, yet it is used.

6243527,5,B00HYZ11R0,I have watched this documentary 6 or 7 times and it never gets old. Everyone should watch it! Michael Mosley does a fantastic job as the narrator/presenter/producer. I retained the information and stories I learned because of how the documentary was presented. It is fascinating to watch. I love the fact that Michael Mosley tests some of the drugs out to show how they work....whether he is doing it for real or not...it gets the point across and works well in this show.,1458259200,,472,4.698795180722891

6243554,5,B00HYZ11R0,"This is a Fabulous production. It is wonderfully done. The producer is a genius, I have never seen anything like it in my life,
I can die now, because I have seen the story of our struggle to survive and I understand it.  We escaped by the skin of our teeth. .
I always suspected that our first President.was killed by his doctors -- where the entire British Army could not touch him. This remarkable
program tells us why and how they did the deed.
I am ordering these DVDs from Amazon as I write this review. Thank the furies for my ROKU and ACORN for making it available to me.
If you do not watch anything else for the rest of your life, let this be the last thing that you watch. OR YOU COULD READ THE BOOK.",1407974400,,711,4.115107913669065

6243560,5,B00HYZ11R0,"I am interested in the history of medicine and this series from the U. K. takes a look at some of the most helpful advances made in that field.  Beginning with pain and the earliest pain killer, opium, Dr. Michael Mosley traces the development of quicker acting and better formulated medications.  Moving on to infection, and then to poison, he gives the history of what physicians tried, and what failed, and then the amazing discoveries of agents that will actually help.  This is a highly entertaining series, an interesting way to learn more about medical practices in the past, what changed medicine for the better, and where we may be heading.  The DVD is accompanied by a viewer's guide that contains additional information on history, longevity, pandemics and poisons.  A nice package, from Athena, it is quality production and information.",1397001600,8,848,5.0285714285714285

8637353,5,B00HYZ11R0,"Interesting and instructive. Includes personal stories and background that adds human interest. Travels to the locations where historical finds occurred. England, Germany, America, to the very houses or laboratories where discoveries were made. Makes story come alive.

Shows the operating theatre where ether first used. Developed by two dentists, who failed in the first attempt (one committed suicide). Interesting.

Video divided into three parts,

1) Pain - that is the development of pain treatment, starting with laudanum in the nineteenth century. Later refined into morphine. Explains that aspirin and heroin came from the same research.

1. Opiate Origins
2. Surgical Anesthesia
3. From Coal Tar
4. Specific Compounds
5. Pain Relief

2) Pus - penicillin mentioned by Fleming, but only really developed by British as treatment for soldiers during WW2. Thereafter, huge effort to find additional antibiotics. British companies decline to manufacture it. Scientists travel to Brooklyn and penicillin is mass produced just in time for invasion.

1. Microscopic Killers
2. Treating Disease
3. Fighting Infection
4. Greater Challange
5. Eradication

3) Poison - arsenic used as treatment for syfillis. Bella Donna used by women to dialate pupils to attract men. A poison that also attracted coroners. Covers the unique cures and uses of curare, venom, scorpions, etc.. Mustard gas invented for WW1. Later the first chemical used in cancer treatment. Start of chemotherapy.

1. The Eccentric
2. Creating Chemists
3. Another Battle
4. New Drugs

Also presents the difference of bacteria and virus. Shows how the recent understanding of human genome will enable individualized medicine.

These three episodes last 159 minutes.
 Also includes extra 27 minutes on ''Seven Wonders of the Microbe World''.
1. The Black Death
2. Food Preservation
3. Nitrogen Fixation
4. Antibiotics
5. Genetic Engineering
6. Life on Mars
7. Beer
These were short, interesting and educational. Great!

This is not chemistry class, but closer to history of medicine.

Enjoyable and educational. Plan to watch with my grandson.",1484611200,5,2125,5.501538461538462
