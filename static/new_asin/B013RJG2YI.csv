8728562,3,B013RJG2YI,"Great footage of the Phenomenal Jay Graydon, however the DVD  case that it was packaged in is aweful. The 4 DVDs are all stacked on one single spindle, and all fell off during shipping which caused some scratches. I kept it because they all seem to play, but for this kind of money, they could have packaged them better. A++ for content, F for packaging.",1469232000,,354,4.446153846153846
