7825376,5,6302373972,"Prime-time Lou Reed performance. The Man is captured here at the definite peak of his powers. One would think it's impossible to improve upon a masterpiece --- the ""New York"" album --- but Lou & his crew manage to accomplish that very feat in this concert. The studio recordings are 'bested' by the fiery, passionate playing by the musicians & the totally committed 'take-no-prisoners' vocals delivered by Mr. Reed. Live Rock doesn't get better than that documented on this video.

My favorite segment of the show is when the band plunges in to ""Busload of Faith,"" ""Sick of You,"" ""Hold On"" & then follows those up with a thunderous reading of ""Good Evening Mr. Waldheim."" A transcendent musical moment indeed.

I've wanted to add this video to my collection for nearly 23 years. Now that I think about it, I've really desired some form of visual documentation of Lou's ""New York"" Tour ever since I attended his show at the Palace Theater in Columbus, Ohio in March, 1989. That gig was a stellar performance, like this one, & was also filmed. Where is that footage today?

While I absolutely love this video in its 'as is' state, I do have two suggestions for improvements on a reissue of this title. 1) The entire concert needs to be released on DVD. The performance of the ""New York"" album, in its entirety, was only the beginning of the show; other selections were played, encores need to be included. In Columbus, I recall a very potent version of ""Vicious"" being offered as the final encore. 2) A 'deluxe edition' DVD(s) of this concert (filmed at Montreal's Theatre St. Denis on August 13, 1989) should be made available to the general public, with bonus discs containing interviews & the complete March, 1989 Palace Theater gig in Columbus.

Dear Laurie Anderson, are you listening? Will you please be so kind as to treat us to a gift such as this?",1385856000,3,1854,4.695384615384615
7825377,4,6302373972,An evening of Lou Reed's second true film for the ears (his first being the 1973 Berlin album) caught on the aging VHS format. The music comes across with more depth and passion when performed live than on the already vivd and staggeringly poetic recording. A Must for Reed disicples,1037232000,3,283,4.68
