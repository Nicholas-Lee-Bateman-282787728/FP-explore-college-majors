4216089,5,B003X8597A,"This is the first performance of Rienzi to be recorded on DVD. Any Wagnerite is going to jump at the chance of seeing it.

Fortunately, this is a very entertaining production. Admittedly, cuts have been profound and sweeping; out of the five hour original only 2.5 hours remain. I'm not familiar enough with the full version to comment on whether the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater, but to my ear, what was left was strongly Wagnerian, with none of the fluff described in many accounts of the original. Clearly, the scenes have been selected to match the premise, that Rienzi was a proto-Fhrer. Again, I don't know whether this is a distortion of the original.

The opening scene, where a somewhat acrobatic body double performed during the overture, was reminiscent of Obersaltzberg, complete with panoramic window and Mussolini fireplace, although the director, in the 'making of' interview, claimed that this wasn't intentional. Much use was made throughout of a bi-level stage, with the main action taking place above the lower section - a concrete bunker. There was also copious use of monochrome video, giving a strong flavour of Leni Riefenstahl.

Musically splendid, with some outstanding performances. Torsten Kerl was the perfect despot, incorporating many of the mannerisms of those chaps from the beginning of last century.
Kate Aldrich, as Adriano was amazing. Just amazing.

Strongly recommended.

On a second viewing, there was a particularly strong scene where the chorus removed their grotesque masks, and normal street clothes, and replaced them with uniforms, complete with stylized 'R' symbols. The individuals were now identifiable, but made anonymous by the costumes.

The more I watch this, the more I like it.",1286150400,29,1746,5.195729537366548
4216090,4,B003X8597A,"Normally an abridged version of an opera would not be something one would find acceptable, particularly when the production itself has been updated and modernised, but Wagner's 1842 opera Rienzi (Rienzi Der Letzte Der Tribunen) - almost forgotten but certainly eclipsed by the composer's next opera Der fliegende Hollnder - is an opera in serious need of rehabilitation, not least because of the infamy of it supposedly being Hitler's favourite opera.  Cut down in half from its original five hour running time, the five acts compressed into two parts, this 2010 Deutsche Oper Berlin production, conducted by Sebastian Lang-Lessing and directed by pop-video and film director Philipp Stlzl, does however manage to give a new lease of life to the opera, or at least bring out elements in it that suggest that, for all its flaws and its troubled history, it's time the opera were confronted to determine whether its worthy of reconsideration and re-evaluation.

As the story deals with the rise and fall of the 14th century Roman dictator Cola di Rienzo, it seems appropriate in this production to emphasise the uncanny parallels that the opera has with the rise of Hitler and his downfall.  To not do so would be unthinkable, according to the director Philipp Stlzl, and indeed it's impossible not to see the remarkable coincidences in the common circumstances that give rise to a Rienzi here and those of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin or Ceausescu.  Accordingly, being a German production, the opening part of Rienzi with the struggles between the Orsini and the Colonna factions, is clearly set in Germany's interwar years.  In the midst of these troubled times, Rienzi appears, promising to bring the people freedom, lead them out of their shame and make them a great nation once again, despite the warning from Adriano that ""to reach your proud ends, you shall leave a trail of blood"".

Brilliantly, the staging absorbs the cultural references of the times, Rome/Berlin looking like a backdrop of Fritz Lang's Metropolis with German Expressionist angles, while the warring Orsini and Colonna followers are masked and distorted like figures out of a colourful George Grosz painting.  This soon changes unsettlingly into the militaristic imagery of a fascist dictatorship, with propaganda films influenced by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will playing out in the background.  As Rome enters into war in the second part of the revised opera, an increasingly embattled Rienzi is seen in a underground bunker, planning his grand vision of a new Rome while the reality above the ground is something quite different.  The parallels between Rienzi and Hitler are eerily premonitory, arising as much from the text of the libretto as the production design and never feeling forced.

Apart from the association of Wagner with the Third Reich, in almost all other respects, the Grand Opera of Rienzi scarcely feels like a Wagnerian musical drama.  The busy crowded staging and the huge rousing choruses are a recognisable feature and there are one or two prototype Wagner characters in this early opera, but otherwise the drama and storytelling is concise and to the point.  Not being familiar with the full 5-hour version of Rienzi, much of this however could be down to the tightening of the focus by the cutting down of the opera for this production, but the decision to revise the opera considerably seems justified by the results.

This is not a great Wagner opera by any means, certainly not when compared to Der fliegende Hollnder which immediately followed it, but musically it's not a bad opera in its own right, with a beautiful overture, some wonderful symphonic passages, and there is a strong study of the conditions that give rise to a dictatorship in its drama.  It at least has a certain curiosity value in the fact that Hitler would have seen in this opera the means of his own rise to power and a premonition of his downfall, but it also has an interesting place in the history and development of German opera.

The Blu-ray edition of Rienzi has a 16:9 image that is just about flawless.  There's a strong 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio mix, althuough I didn't notice any LFE subwoofer activity at all - your neighbours however will probably be thankful for this considering the force of the performance and the recording that is still evident.  The PCM stereo mix is also terrific.  A 27-minute Making Of is not particularly in-depth, but covers the background and the concept of this production through interviews and rehearsal footage.",1284336000,18,4540,5.0066401062417
4216091,4,B003X8597A,"This DVD presents a bold re-interpretation of this early opera by Richard Wagner. The title character is re-imagined as a 20th century dictator with a uniform fetish, who rises to power on the back of the common people, only to be killed in an underground bunker in the last act. (Sound like anyone you've heard of?) It's fitting that this brilliant staging by Philipp Stlzl was filmed at the Deutsches Oper Berlin in 2010. It's the first Rienzi on video, and the first essential Wagner DVD to be released in some time.

Rienzi is Wagner's third opera. It is his longest work: (five acts, six hours) a gigantic grand opera in the manner of Meyerbeer.  Philipp Stlzl cut the score severely for this performance, chopping out ballets, finales, choruses, processions, and whole swaths to get it down to a lean two and a half hours.  The truncation of the score is clever, if ruthless.

This music is very different from mature Wagner. He wrote it when he was 26, and by time the opera was premiered (eight years later) the ever-restless composer had moved on to Der Fliegende Hllander and was already planning Tannhuser. The Deutsches Oper Berlin orchestra plays brilliantly under the baton of Stephen Lang-Lessing. The decision to  retain Wagner's early (and sometimes clumsy) orchestrations intact gives the work charm and shows the care that went into this performance.

Heldentenor Torsten Kerl gives a moving performance in the title role, singing with a high, penetrating tone that blooms into moments of sweetness. This part has hellish difficulties written into it by the young, ambitious Wagner. Much declamatory singing is required, forcing the tenor to be heard over a heavy orchestra. Mr. Kerl rises to the challenge, soaring to an impressive height for the moment when Rienzi rejects the crown in Act Two.

His best singing is in the final act, during Rienzi's prayer. This famous scene (its main theme is the backbone of the Overture) unfolds with a warm outpouring of tone as it rises to its climax. In the final scene, Mr. Kerl loose with his full instrument, and the effect is devastating.

Soprano Kate Aldrich is a potent figure in the trouser role of Adriano Colonna, the would-be assassin who is also in love with Rienzi's sister Irene. As Irene, soprano Camilla Nylund sings with hard, bright tone that fits the role of Rienzi's chief lieutenant and collaborator. There is the chilling suggestion of incest in their sibling relationship. The other star of this show is the Deutsches Staatsoper's main and auxilary choruses, who do remarkable work in this opera's many public scenes.

The production makes extensive use of back-projected films by fettFilm (Torge Mller and Momme Hinrichs). Cribbing from the films of Leni Riefensthaal (most notably Triumph of the Will) the films are used as on-set propaganda and a narrative device throughout.

The costume design (by the team of Kathi Maurer and Ursula Kudrna) is also clever. In the second act, the onstage mob of Roman citizens takes off their civilian colors to revealchiaroscuro uniforms, emblazoned with the ""Diamond-R"" rune that serves as the symbol of Rienzi's government. As the dictator comes to power, all color is bled out of Rome. The effect is terrifying.

Rienzi was Hitler's favorite opera. In 1905, the 16-year-old dictator-to-be attended a performance in Linz, Austria. That may have inspired much of the iconography, (and some of the the political philosophy) adopted by the former house painter as he led Germany down the path of genocide and destruction. So it's understandable that it doesn't get performed much. By re-imagining the work in this radical new way, the creative forces behind this staging may have actually redeemed it. Wagner would have been pleased.",1314403200,9,3756,5.022508038585209
4216092,5,B003X8597A,"According to the notes in the booklet included with the opera,Hitler borrowed from the opera Heil Rienzi, and turned it into Heil Hitler. Also, the  idea of staging rituals and mass rituals came from this opera. The overture to Rienzi became the unoffical anthem of the Third Reich. I would have thought the staging would use Mussolini as its center piece. Thus, the opera is modern staging, set in the 1920's upwards. I could not see  the traditionalists would have any problems with the staging, unless they wanted the staging set in Rome in the 14th Century. I was wrong. This  early opera had its first performance in Dresden 1842. This night was the most sucessful of Wagner's life. More of this opera later.

Because of the ideas behind this staging of this opera, I will attempt to explain Wagner. He was a contradictory character. He wrote articles on vegetarianism, but ate meat and berated people who did not. He composed Parsival,which was about celebrate knights, some of whom are gradually seduced by flower maidens. When Wagner was asked about this he stated,"" I would like to be a Saint but I am a artist. To compose I need to be as I am"". His attitude towards Jews was not the best. His first article on Jews, was because he felt Meyerbeer should have done more to help him. But later on he did write more negative articles. He was forced to allow Levi to conduct the first performance of Parsival. Many Jews admired his work. He did feel they should be intergrated into the Fatherland, through his work. He was friendly with a number of people of this faith.  Unfortunately, for Wagner, Cosima,his wife was completely anti semitic. She became friendly with Houston Chamberlain, who believed that the future lay in Germany's hands. He also believed that Jesus was not a Jew but an Aryan.(?) He wrote the book 'Die Grundlagen' on this subject which even King  Wilhelm 11 read. A book that made this dangerous brew of nationalism and anti semiticism, palatable to the middle class, proud of Germany and hostile to Jews. This book was popular in Britain and France. In fact Houston was revered by the Nazi's. When he died in 1927 the Nazi's milked the death for all it was worth. He was seen as their Guru figure. Eventually, after many years of marriage,Houston married Eva,Richard and Cosimas daughter. Winifried married Siegfried, Richards son and she became an early follower of Hitler and probably his lover. The  rest is history. Hitler and his views, with the Nazi's, wiped out 6 million Jews. Wagner is seen as partly responsble for this. The reasoning is that his writings and music influenced Hitler. It is more complicated then that. If anyone did, it would be Houston Chamberlain. Hitler quoted great chunks from him in 'Mein Struggle' Thus, because of this situation characters in the Ring, such as Mime are seen as Jewish. While Wagner saw Mime as himself. A classic case is Klingsor and Kundry, from Parsifal, seen as basic Jewish characters. However,if you study Parsival carefully, you will find that it is based on Buddhism and symbols of Christianity. Act I, the 4th Squire states""she (kundry) is a heathen,a sorceress"". Gurnemanz replies"" Yes,she may be under a curse. She lives here now perhaps reincarnated to expiate some sin from an earlier life, not yet forgiven there. (Here Wagner is discussing Karma). Klingsor sings about who she had been through her many lives. Not very Jewish. Unfortunately, for Wagner, Hitler liked his Music.

Cosima was French, both Winifried and Houston Chamberlain were English and Hitler were Austrian. More German then the Germans. The only true German was the Saxon, Richard Wagner. Whereas when Richard died and she eventually took on the running of the Bayreuth theatre,she would change nothing. Her reasoning was, that this scenery is that the Master laid his eyes upon. She was a rigid person. Whereas, Richard said ""Kinder create anew."" He also wanted new German operas to be played along side his in Bayreuth. He was unsure of his staging of the 1876. It has been recorded that he seemed disinterested. Wieland Wagner,once said that Richards works cannot be staged. Because in life he was changable, contradictory and vented his spleen through writing, he has had a bad press. Even Father Owen Lee, has written, you can like his music, thats fine, you do not have to like the man. The man and his music are interwined. I have explained in my review on the Valencia Ring, some of Wagners Philosophies, also,Tristan und Isolde with Stemme Singing. All on Bluray, what else.

Because this opera has used the rise and fall of Hitler to interpret Rienzi, it is best to understand a little about Wagner, which I have attempted to show. Now we get to the opera itself. For myself, I like it. You can see the beginnings of the future music coming through now and again. The Beginning of the work shows early 1920's and goes through to the Nazi period in Germany. I think this was a way for the director and designer, to bring Hitlers life before the audience. After all, the opera is live from the Deutsche oper Berlin. Act I has the crowds dressed like figures from Expressionistic painters Otto Dix and George Grosz.""The opera owes less to Meyerbeer and more to Spontini and Auber. Also styles ranging from Bellini, Weber to Beethoven Symphonies"".(The Penquin opera guide.ed Holden Viking 1995) Conductor Lang-Lessing's tempi is fast. Brings to the fore the emotion and tension in the piece. Torsten Kerl, Kate Aldrich and Camilla Nylund are  sublime. A dream team to use a sporting term. The staging makes utter sense. The rubbish written by those who do not like this rendition of the opera in the DVDs is unbelievable. I mean why order it. You do not like modern staging, thats fine. I happen to like traditional and modern works.",1309824000,7,5803,4.7997997997998
4216093,2,B003X8597A,"Wagner wrote three early operas that are relatively unknown since they are rarely performed, including die Feen, das Liebesverbot, and Rienzi. They are operas that are not typical of  Wagner's mature style, but do show development toward the final Wagnerian style. Rienzi is the opera that launched Wagner's career as a musician, and several of the pieces including the overture are still occasionally performed. There were no available movie versions of this opera until this performance came out, so I decided to buy it, especially with the reasonable reviews given to it by Amazon.com reviewers. This performance has its merit. The singers were faultless, acting and singing well. The recording was high quality, though there were often problems with mixing of the sound of the singers and the orchestra, in that the orchestra tended to drown out the voices on stage.

My problem with this performance is the staging. I don't object to modern versions of operas, so long as they don't distract from the story and theme of the original opera. If the staging is such that it creates another theme or story than the original opera, or if it restricts itself to being solely a commentary on either the opera or the composer, then it should not be considered as a legitimate version of the opera. I recall the Peter Sellars versions of various operas that attempted contemporary contextualization of 18th and 19th century operas, yet they were never sold as straight opera renditions. Creative license with modern European staging tends to destroy the composers intent, and this should be overtly stated. It would be like re-writing a Beethoven symphony for a Jazz band but calling it the original symphony. Liszt did not have the audacity to do that, but was willing to call his transcriptions something else, and bizarre creative staging should be called something other than the original opera.

The staging used in this performance is indeed bizarre. The citizens of Rome come out masked at first, eventually removing their masks and donning suits that looked more like Soviet peasant outfits. Rienzi and his daughter appeared more like Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun than a noble Roman tribune. The themes of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini prevailed, forcing the entire opera into an entirely other interpretation. Adriano, the traitor, is made into the hero, and Rienzi is reduced to totalitarian scum. The final scene, with Rienzi in Hitler's bunker and Speer's model of the new Berlin before him was exceptionally distractive to the aria ""Allmchtiger Gott..."" and completely out of place. The videos of Rienzi as a totalitarian propagandist before microphones appearing on television were seriously distracting. Wagner's character development in the opera was completely re-written. The behind the scenes slaughter of the assassins at the end of act 1 altered the story of the opera. This is not the way Wagner intended the opera to be, and the staging was too divergent from the actual opera story to be legitimate. I'd rather just listen to a recording than to watch what Stlzl has given us.

Whatever one may think of Wagner, I suggest that performances should leave Wagner alone. It is true that Wagner was a truly despicable  egotistical, racist person, yet his composing is sublime. It is quite easy to see his anti-Jewish sentiments throughout his operas, which must be overlooked. Thankfully, many Jewish Wagner conductors and performers have been able to do that, producing some of the best performances of Wagner in existence (eg., James Levine's Ring, Leonard Bernstein's Tristan und Isolde). To be obsessed with mid-twentieth century totalitarianism when performing a Wagner opera deprives the opera of its legitimate interpretation and reduces the performance to just another case of Euro Trash",1306713600,10,3807,5.1537216828478964
4216094,2,B003X8597A,"The fact that Hitler liked this opera does not make it an opera about Hitler and the nazis or Mussolini and his fascists.  This is a director's 'take' on the opera completely changing the motivation and actions of the principals.  As such it is a travesty though well sung, played and acted.  But never believe this is Wagner's Rienzi - you only have to read the libretto to see how falsely this version represents the drama.

4216096,4,B003X8597A,"I too am a Wagnerphile extreme and have been waiting 20 years for a video-DVD-Blu-Ray of Rienzi. I don't mind updated staging if they magnify the themes and plot of the opera under the lens of more recent historical events. The lens of fascist/totalitarian war-time Europe in the 20th century is quite enlightening for the debut DVD/Blu-Ray of Rienzi. Does anyone really want to see an opera set in 14th century Italy, especially an opera that , likely none of us have ever seen?

My biggest diappointment in this set is the tragic cut of my favorite choral scene 'Der Tag ist da, der Stunde naht...Auf Roemer auf'  This version retains a few quotations of this Act III scene 3 choral music, but the rousing 7 mins of music (Disc 3 track 1 of Staatskapelle Dresden/Heinrich Hollreiser&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Rienzi/dp/B00001SVM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Rienzi</a>is tragically cut.

4216097,5,B003X8597A,"First off let me say that this cut Rienzi is not a desecration of Wagner, and I am a major Wagnerholic. If you have made it through the entire Rienzi (there is a CD available by the BBC) you know that it is a numbing work - chorus after chorus, ballets that never end: enough material for two operas.  Do you really want 5 hours of second rate Meyerbeer? This is not mature Wagner, and anything that helps Rienzi work in the theater is welcome. This DVD delivers.
 Yes, the work is brought up into the 20th century and casts Rienzi as a fascist dictator. But it works. Due to the cuts this streamlined Rienzi makes more of an impact than the sprawling original.

This production is a surrealistic presentation of a composite of all the dictators of the 29th Century and then some. From the very start we see Rienzi hallucinating his colossal office flying into space and suspending Earth in space awaiting his virtues than are neede3d to save it along with Rome. Over the course of the opera you see his break from reality as he genuinely wants to make life better for the people.

I wonder if the noblemen who turned against him because he pardoned them for treason are a warning against what we see in Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito.",1289088000,,810,4.5793103448275865

One wonders why he actually wrote it so long in the first place. I believe that the first ever production took place over two (2) nights.
As a staunch Wagnerian, I would gladly sit through the 6 odd hours of Rienzi, as it contains some of Wagner's most lyrical music.
This is the only music drama that Wagner never ever wanted to be performed at Bayreuth, it had to be performed elsewhere. No reason was given.
Will we ever get a COMPLETE studio recording of this wonderful music drama.
(I use the term `Music Drama"" as Wagner's works are not Operas, they are Music dramas, even he refers to them as such.) I doubt it.
Back to this production from Deutsche Oper, Berlin:
I HATE modern stagings of Wagner. The production does nothing for me at all. It might as well be a completely different music drama. Nothing like what Wagner had in mind when he wrote it. However: the singing is brilliant and the cast exceptional. Torsten Kerl makes a wonderful  Rienzi, Camilla Nyland is excellent as Irene and Kate Aldrich does justice to the role of Adriano Collono. The orchestra and chorus are under the baton of Sebasitan Lang-Leesing (our very own Chief conductor of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra). One of my many complaints is that you never see the orchestra and the conduction is not included in the curtain calls.  The sound quality is exceptional. But sadly the production didn't cut it for me. The cost to do these weird productions is just as much as a traditional one, so why do it. I though the idea was to draw people to the theatre, NOT drive them away with these STUPID childish productions.
I turn the TV OFF and just listen to the music, that's how I cope with this production. It's much better that way as there really in nothing to see. You might enjoy it, but I didn't and make no apology about it.",1287532800,18,1975,4.4986072423398324

8407875,3,B003X8597A,"Before someone reports me to Amazon, let me point out that ""Grosser querschnitt"" is German for ""highlights"" (literally ""greater cross-section"").

Wagner conceived Rienzi for the Paris Opera, with lots of choruses and ballet music, which the French insisted on.
The actual premiere was in Dresden in 1842.
Rienzi lasted about six hours.

Subsequent performances shortened it considerably.
The original score was lost in a World War II bombing raid.
A roughly two-and-a-half hour version was thought to be all that survived - until the 1970s when musicologists pieced together an additional two hours from surviving fragments.
This was the basis for the BBC's pioneering 4 hour, 40 minute broadcast in 1976, the single most important performance of the opera since 1842.

There are two competing performances on Blu-Ray, both featuring Torsten Kerl in the title role:

2010: 2 hours, 36 minutes = Berlin Opera conducted by Sebastian Lang-Lessing: The Blu-Ray under review.

2013: 2 hours, 56 minutes = Toulouse Thatre du Capitole conducted by Pinchas Steinberg:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Rienzi-Blu-ray/dp/B00DERONLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Rienzi [Blu-ray</a>]

(actual timings are less due to curtain calls and production credits)

Rienzi was Wagner's most popular opera during his lifetime.
Adolf Hitler may have inadvertently killed Rienzi when word got out that it was his favorite opera.
This seems unfair:
After the war, his valet reported that Hitler's favorite movie was ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""
yet Snow White seems to have survived unscathed.

Though he lived in Italy in the Fourteenth Century, poor Rienzi has suffered for his supposed Nazi connection.
An irresistable temptation for trendy opera directors with a keen grasp of the obvious.
The 2010 Berlin performance is especially clueless.
Silly, really.

The 2013 Toulouse Thatre performance is more abstract in its staging, therefore
Less Silly.

- Toulouse has twenty minutes more music than Berlin.
- Toulouse has smarter staging than Berlin.
- Toulouse has a 55 minute documentary vs. 26 minutes in Berlin.
- Both Blu-Rays have the same tenor in the lead role.
- Both Blu-Rays have 5.1 surround sound and subtitles in all the usual languages.

If you need Rienzi on Blu-Ray, Toulouse Thatre du Capitole is my recommendation.

However, there is always a catch, and that's where Grosser querschnitt comes in.
Both Blu-Rays are heavily cut.

I wouldn't mind it if Opera Houses wanted to present abridged performances, if only ONE uncut Rienzi was available on CD or DVD/Blu-Ray.
CD recordings ranged from 1 hour, 58 minutes to 3 hours, 38 minutes.

The 4 hour, 40 minute BBC broadcast under Edward Downes, with John Mitchison as Rienzi, used to be available as a 4 CD set on the Italian label Ponto,
but unfortunately Ponto forgot to get the BBC's permission and the CDs have been withdrawn.

The Ponto version of the Downes/BBC Rienzi is available as a download (6 euros) on opera-club.net
Recommended as a stopgap.
And if the BBC ever decides on an official release, I hope they don't forget the libretto and translation
(now that I'm at it, I wouldn't sneeze at a new uncut recording conducted by Barenboim, Janowski or Thielemann).

For the time being, your best bet is Hollreiser/EMI, with Rene Kollo as Rienzi, the longest of available performances, at 3 hours, 38 minutes.

For one thing, it takes a tale set in ancient Rome and puts it in a II World War type setting, transforming the typical Wagner grand vision into an anti-fascist fable.  But for me it works.  And in a way, even makes the piece more acceptable.  This was Wagner in his youth, when spectacle and soaring melodies were his gods, but still a bit beyond his reach.  The original opera ran over some five hours, and that would have been pretty unbearable to me.  There is frankly only one really memorable song in the piece, but what a melody.  Sung by the hero Rienzi, a Juan Peron type despot, it is the prayer of a self-deluded man who dies in ruins.  I didn't believe his sincerity for a minute, but I did believe his pain.  This Rienzi is the Reader's Digest version, but it still runs around three hours long.  It is visually satisfying and the performance is first class singing.  As drama it is inclined to be static - but Wagner is usually far more interested in music than in action.  He gets better about that in his later masterpieces.  (I understand this was one opera he banned from his opera house in Bayreut as not up to his mature standards.)  But if you love Wagner, and always wonder about the neglected opera, here's as satisfying a way to sample it as you could find.  I give four stars, not because I have any problem with the performance, only because I believe Wagner was right.  This will never be an opera I would be willing to say I love.",1368403200,2,1520,4.336879432624113
8407878,1,B003X8597A,"I was very excited to buy a DVD of Rienzi, but this was a great disappointment.  My husband and I are opera fans, but we both found this staging and presentation oppressive and unpleasant, and quit watching after enduring the first half hour.",1362268800,,242,4.627906976744186
8407879,5,B003X8597A,"Terrific modern rendition of Wagner's Rienzi! Having seen it live, this recording masterfully captured the essential aspects of the production with powerful performances by all, especially that of Rienzi and surprisingly Adriano. A must for the hardcore Rienzi fans!",1358208000,3,266,5.846153846153846
8407880,2,B003X8597A,"I agree with K. Feucht's review (also two stars). The singing and orchestra were superb, but the onstage actions and attitudes had little resemblance to Wagner's score. I had expected to experience Wagner's opera. Instead I got Stolzl's re-interpretation. I don't want that.

My problem is not with the abridgement, the modernist setting, or even the masks. I object to misrepresenting the characters based on Stolzl's view of what they ought to be.

Does the fact that Hitler loved this opera justify changing it into something Wagner wouldn't recognize? Not to me. Give us the opera as Wagner created it, and let us decide its merits.",1356480000,8,636,4.990566037735849
8407881,4,B003X8597A,"So, I bought it because I'm a big Wagner fan and I knew and liked the famous Overture.  Perhaps, above all, I bought it because I wanted to have as complete a collection of Wagner DVDs as possible.  A nice surprise.  The ""modern"" setting worked very well.  The casting and music were very good and Camilla Nylund is gorgeous.  While I would only give 5 stars to something so great that it warrants getting out of your sick bed to buy it, my four stars mean it's very worthwhile and I thoroughly enjoyed and strongly recommend it.",1354838400,4,529,4.412371134020619
8407882,4,B003X8597A,"Good quality of dvd, two discs, very good tenor, orchestra and chorus from Berlin Opera. Unhappily the modern staging, as in use these days, with tasteless associations from recent history, does not reflect the real sense of the libretto.",1326931200,4,238,5.128205128205129
