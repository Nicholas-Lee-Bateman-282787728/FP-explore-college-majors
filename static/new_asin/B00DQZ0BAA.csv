8596515,5,B00DQZ0BAA,"I love this yoga workout DVD. Lilly is one of my favorite yoga teachers on the North Shore of Oahu, and I was so happy when she developed this DVD, so that I could take my yoga practice with me when I moved away for school. She combines strength and grace to create a unique and meaningful practice that is challenging for both the body and heart.",1373414400,,347,4.1940298507462686
