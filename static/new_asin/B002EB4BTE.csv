8367470,3,B002EB4BTE,"I recently purchased this collection and was underwhelmed by the packaging. As a few reviewers have stated, it is a bootleg version of the originals. It provides both Japanese and English language tracks as well as English subtitles. However, it becomes quickly apparent that these films were burned the moment you open the packaging. I originally bought this set after I had bought Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust. I bought it with the intention of replacing that DVD because I'd lost it some years ago. Yet I still remember the DVD graphics and special features the original Bloodlust DVD contained. The ""Collection"" does not have an intro, but instead takes you directly to the main menu where it provides ""Language Settings and Subtitles"" as well the option to play Vampire Hunter D or Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust. I watched Bloodlust first and was surprisingly happy to see that the graphics were still good despite it not being an original copy. However, when I watched Vampire Hunter D, the film was a little grainy and dark. I had originally paid $17 for this copy which is the cheapest price I've been able to find online. Would I have bought it a second time had I known this was a copy? Probably not. I like collecting DVDs and knowing this was just an amateur made copy being advertised as an official collection was disappointing.",1386460800,6,1337,4.842794759825328
8367471,1,B002EB4BTE,"As another reviewer said, this is just a bootleg version. The fact that its listed as ""All regions"" (DVDs aren't region free), makes it obvious. If you're going to buy this, you might as well just download the movie illegally, burn it to a disk, and print out some cover art and stick it on... Cause that is exactly what this is.",1383955200,4,329,4.32258064516129
8367472,5,B002EB4BTE,had trouble finding the first vampire hunter d on dvd but this had that and bloodlust great find at great price,1361836800,,111,4.333333333333333
8367473,4,B002EB4BTE,Reason i rate this a four and not a 5 is because there is 2 in one. The first vampire hunter movie is an old one but still a great movie. You can tell it's dated but the story is solid. Now the second one (bloodlust) is an amazingly put together movie. It's about a vampire who is hired for odd jobs to be a mercenary.,1361145600,,318,3.8333333333333335
8367474,1,B002EB4BTE,"This ""collection"" is nothing more than Vampire Hunter D the VHS version, ripped onto a computer and converted to MPEG-2 format, and Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust (found on DVD) ripped onto a computer in MPEG-2 format. All the thief who ""produced"" this DVD did was burn those two MPEG-2 files onto a blank DVD and put a cheap graffic to label the disc. The DVD case is a generic black case with a grainy printer copy of the original box cover art for Vampire Hunter D, that was home shrink wrapped.

The disc plays on a computer, but will not play in any standard DVD player, so you can't watch it on your regular TV. The quality is sub standard and grainy because you're getting old school VHS quality on a DVD, along with the garbage analog audio.

Had I known I was buying a cheap bootleg copy of a movie, I probably would have passed on the purchase; because bootlegs are always so low in quality that they are usually only worth watching for free.

Skip this purchase and try to find something better quality or a free bootleg elsewhere.",1359936000,2,1038,4.424083769633508
8367475,5,B002EB4BTE,"Awesome set! I loved the first Vampire Hunter D and have that in VHS. I was delighted to find both the first movie and Bloodlines on one disk. Plays like a dream and they kept the imperfections of the film of the first D in the DVD. I liked watching it like it was back then, rather than having the creators ""George Lucas"" it. Great movies and nope, I'm not going to give any spoiler details, just watch it. You won't regret it!",1357603200,,428,4.168674698795181
8367476,2,B002EB4BTE,"Well firstly I have a very old dvd of the original, aka vampire hunter D.

This ""collection"" includes

1. Vampire Hunter D

AND

2. Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust

Now lets get to what this has. It has no special features. It is only the two movies and it includes an audio and subtitles set up with english and japanese. Very Simple. Nothing else.

Now I do not own the Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, so I can't compare it to an earlier copy. The Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust though was a good resolution. Good contrast and light and darkness. The Story line is a bit cheesy.

~~SPOILER ALERT~~
Vampire man and human girl (in love) want to run off to a old vampire spaceship that will take them to a mythical city of night in the sky where vampires and humans can live together as a couple? I guess? O.o Cause nothing says fantasy horror vampire movie like spaceships, but hey, it wasn't horrible. Oh and they are being per-sued by vampire hunters of course.

Now as to the Vampire Hunter D original. For it being made in 1985, we can say even now it was way ahead of its time. I don't really have to say anything about the story line because I'm sure you all ready know. It's in itself an anime classic. BUT...

As to this copy included in this dvd ""collection"". It has horrible contract, light and darkness, and the resolution is much to be desired. Now that's taking into account that at the time 1985s' animation was limited. BUT I have like I said the original all ready on dvd and it still plays fine. As I was watching it on the collection dvd, I noticed, on most of the dark clips on the original, I couldn't see anything! It was completely dark. The darkened colors on the original collections version only come out as complete blackness. No details are seen at all. I found myself saying, this cant be right?! The original isn't like this ...is it?!

So after the original finished on the collection, I popped in my original I have and played it. Its a dvd version as well, and surprise surprise, the colors were crisp and clear, and the what was total darkness on the collections version were totally visible on the original. The color resolution is way off, and even with tv adjustments they could not be fixed to be seen.

So in summary.

Vampire hunter d on this collection, sucks, not the story line, but the copy itself. Its flawed, and hard to see. The contract and resolution are off and even if you adjust your tv its still hard to make out the dark colors without them only being seen as complete blackness.

the Vampire hunter d bloodlust, on the other hand is a pretty good copy imo, even though I have nothing to compare it to. It seemed crisp and clear. Though the storyline was a bit cheesy, The copy itself included is a good version.

Sadly I don't know what I'm going to do. I was hoping to get rid of my older dvd version of the original and replace it with this, but now I can't. The Vampire Hunter D original on this collection is horrible. There is no way I would replace it for my original which has crisp clean color and good darkness and light contract. Oh well I guess =/",1355184000,2,3099,4.348353552859619
