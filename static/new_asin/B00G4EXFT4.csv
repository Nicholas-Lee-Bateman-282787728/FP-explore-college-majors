8620590,5,B00G4EXFT4,The romance in the story was so sweet. The scenery beautiful and the heartbreak of both sisters were mine too. And the ending was surprising and most welcome. I had to tear up. Great movie and I love David Morrisey.  What I didn't like is that there was really a time when girls wouldn't be considered for marriage unless they had money or a title.,1511568000,,348,4.3538461538461535
