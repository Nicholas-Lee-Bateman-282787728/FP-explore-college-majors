7923168,3,B00004TWWK,"I LOVE the artistry, craftsmanship, creativity & whimsy of Harmony Kingdom so it was interesting enough to watch, however, it IS very SHORT, not even a full 12 min as described.  Only 11 min, 17 secs to be exact, including the ""The End"" screen & short list of credits.  Buyers should know that this video is more of an extended commercial and FAR from an actual documentary on the company, or its talented artists & very enchanting pieces.  SHAME on Amazon for describing it as ""Encompassing all aspects of Harmony Kingdom"" and for not DISCLOSING what it really is -- a promotional video that was probably sent (Free?) to retailers who carry the Harmony Kingdom lines.  The 11-min clip REPEATS itself 6 times on the tape!  It was obviously designed to play on a LOOP next to the items on display on a little VCR/monitor.  It is somewhat forgiven that the piece was shot in 2000 but the narration & quality of the tape is also quite amateur-ish, as if it was shot using a home video camera & duplicated the same way.  I don't mind owning the video only because I DO like Harmony Kingdom, but I doubt many H.K. collectors would consider it worth the $12 I paid.  I would've given it 4-stars if it weren't so overpriced & the description weren't so misleading.  Harmony Kingdom/Harmony Ball Co. would do well to produce an updated, longer & more professional version.  I DID enjoy it the brief content that was actually about the artists & the pieces but in my opinion, this VHS would be more appropriately labeled as a vintage promotional piece & should selling for no more than $3 on ebay.",1275350400,,1588,4.559859154929577
