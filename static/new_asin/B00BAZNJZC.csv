8565115,5,B00BAZNJZC,"For all it's popularity, Xena has been tremendously underestimated as a layered story of the growth and complexity of two women and the connected characters. Despite a sometimes tongue-in-check tone and outright silliness and goofy humor, it's about Xena and Gabriellle finding themselves with all their internal conflicts. Nobody but Lucy Lawless could have played Xena-she is complex, can pull out deep emotions from god knows where and also Lawless played it a little machisma-deliberately she remains stunningly beautiful and sexy. But it's the synchrony between Renee O'Conner as
Gabrielle and Lucy that totally makes the series one of a kind about all people finding themselves despite conflict and adversity. There are hundreds of thousands of Xena fans from all walks of life around the world. Every year since 1995 there is a Xena Convention held by Creation first in Pasadena and then Burbank California. Most of the artists come and talk with the Audience-free form and are very much their real selves. The highlight is of course Lucy and Renee-they are extremely funny, highly intelligent and beautiful woman do Q and A with the audience and no holds barred in their answers- they did a hilarious skit cold reading by one of their popular  writers, Missy Good, that the audience on their feet screaming and laughing-there is a wonderful feeling at these conventions of warmth, welcome, generosity and openness -and that comes from Lucy and Renee, Rob Tapert-exec producer, all the writers and incredible team work actors input in developing every episode. Tapert created a brilliant series, picked precisely the right actors as a family and every year fans get to share in the ""Xenaverse"" And the opportunity to chat with the cast.this year was particularly funny and warm-one of the best",1391990400,,1800,5.143344709897611
