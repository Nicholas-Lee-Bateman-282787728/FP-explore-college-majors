7370398,1,B013PSLVGA,"At  90 minutes this film  is  very overlong and tedious. It would have been better as a 30 minute short. The shaking  ,hand  held camera can be  annoying at times. A couple of  lengthy night scenes (possibly love making scenes) are so dark that  you cannot see what it going on. The screen is void of anything - almost completely  black. Very amateur camera work and photography and lighting. We have seen better gay films from Argentina.",1451088000,6,438,4.584415584415584
7370399,5,B013PSLVGA,"Jess & James is a captivating movie.  It follows the line of a road trip film, divided into chapters, but it often goes off road into strange placesa herd of cows on a dirt road, for example, a cemetery, a large estate seemingly occupied only by one woman with a chapel, ripened citrus fruit, sheep, and a ghost child also part of it, the under pass of a bridge as a train crosses it above the two young men, and so on.

In one town, the two young men meet a third.  They become a trio of sorts and a part of their courtship, the courtship between Jess and James, but also a courtship among all three, Toms included, is for two of them to dance on a narrow promontory as the third watches.  Toms is merely teaching each of the other two in turn  how to dance while the other one looks on.  But the moment, with its movement, its implications of both jealousy and adoration, takes on some of the rhythm of a rite.

None of these moments is, in a way, driven by plot, though there is a narrative underlying the movie.  The heart of it, in every sense, is the developing, deepening love between Jess and James.  That is what the trip is about.  But this is a film clearly influenced by the Latin American admiration, even love for magical realism, both in literature and film.  That influence means that the movie is more given to what happens in and through its images, however strange or inexplicable, than in either character development or a driving plot.  Its meanings are more lyrical than narratively logical as they might be in an artwork created from a stricter, more rational understanding of 'realism.'

Magical realist film is hardly new.  It has been an important part of Spanish and Latin America film making for decades.  What is new is how Jess &James uses it for a gay love story.  Or I should say it is almost new because Marco Berger has made use of it in several of his remarkable movies, too, though subtly, with less of an emphasis placed upon it.  And there are others, many as good. Jess & James is wondrous, but in any work of magical realism, one ought not emphasize the magic at the expense of the realism.  This film does not.  Its feel for the real, what is true and necessary in all of its three main characters, keeps it grounded as well.

It is in many ways a movie following the path of an archetypal road trip, one of the oldest narrative conventions in the world.  Think Gilgamesh or Odysseus.  But this is no epic.  It is a gentler film, quiet, subtle, poignant, lovely, arresting.  It is about love found and thereafter deepening in ways that are mysterious without being entirely inexplicable, in ways that are clear while also being, in a sense, miraculous and strange and  imaginatively generous.  It is a way of seeing love opening into its reality, a reality which includes love's lyric overflowing, its happiness.",1445817600,15,2853,4.48062015503876
7370400,2,B013PSLVGA,"Moments of brilliance and moments of needless confusion. I am a very sophisticated viewer and reader. If you are not, you will wonder what is going on. Tread softly.",1445472000,6,165,4.724137931034483
7370401,4,B013PSLVGA,"Jess is described as a Bohemian youth who is struggling, in Argentina, to live up to the expectations of his parents and wants to be who he really is  and that is gay. Then there is James who is a disgruntled waiter and is fed up living with his yoga loving and judgemental mother. The two guys hook up  and after some graphic, if simulated, rutting they decide to go on a road trip.

This is the story of that trip and the good and bad times that ensue including meeting Tomas and what he brings to the relationship. Now this is a small budget affair  they even have a Citroen for the road trip and the music is a bit electro annoying in places and for me was the least enjoyable part of this film  others may disagree. Despite that this is still an accomplished effort.

It is though fairly stylish and depictions of sex and the emotions that are evoked are all done extremely well. A relatively unknown cast did not show any limitations by their lack of experience and all manage to do convincing performances. It is also very beautifully shot with a keen eye for an arty angle and very good use of colour and texture to add to the mood and depth of the scenes. It is in Spanish with OK sub titles and runs to around 92 minutes. This is for those World Cinema fans who don't mind a bit of sex but also want the story to be the main pull and enjoy a smattering of arthouse on the side.",1444780800,22,1387,4.176029962546816
7370402,4,B013PSLVGA,"This is a beautiful film. This narrative is structured like a rubber band stretched to its limit; the further the characters get away from their lives back home during their road trip, the more the band threatens to snap them back.

7370407,5,B013PSLVGA,"This movie took me 3 times to appreciate it.  The first time, I didn't like the music at the beginning, and how the movie started.  But as you stick with the movie, you are taken on a journey.  I got absorbed into their journey and travel.  I thought all 3 main characters were playful, and hot (attractive).  There was some good interaction between all of them, which I liked.  Movie made me wanting to be with them.

7370418,4,B013PSLVGA,"This one really rings true. While you wonder what will become of the boys as they make their way through life, as a road movie, representing a brief portion of their lives, it works. And they are so polite and have good manners in dealing with all the folks they meet along their journey through the Pampas of Argentina. Having some time where you don't have to be somewhere or do something specific all the time, there's time to just explore where you and make the most of it. And that's what they do. Would be interesting to see if they make a sequel of the movie, this time 10 years later, where the guys have moved to Buenos Aires and have jobs and a life together. And I really liked the music in the film. All the discordant notes seemed just right for a road picture.",1459641600,9,774,4.272108843537415

7370420,5,B013PSLVGA,"SPOILER ALERT:  there is a happy ending.  The movie avoids cashing in on the well-done, realistic  family psychopathology to generate a morbid outcome.  Sure, there are continuity problems, etc.  So what?  James has the ""best orgasm ever"", and this convinces him to love Jesse forever, and even to welcome a third to their trysting.  A scene in a chapel lines up a shot of a cross with Jess leaning back over his pew while James works on him below, to produce an anti-crucifixion image of pleasure,",1455840000,10,498,4.72093023255814
7370421,5,B013PSLVGA,"""Jess & James"" is a road trip movie through rural Argentina, with two gorgeous leads, and it's an absolute joy.

The boys have various adventures along the way, encountering eccentrics and, yes, homophobia. And they also meet a third boy, Toms, leading to a steamy (but not gratuitous) mnage  trois.

The soundtrack is odd, like a 1970s ""Doctor Who"", but it's pleasing, not jarring or intrusive, and a welcome departure from the irritating Indie warbling often favoured by arthouse productions.

Better yet, ""Jess & James"" doesn't end with one (or both) of boys murdered in an act of homophobic violence. Thank you for that, writer and director Santiago Giralt. And thank you for an absolute gem of a film, one I'll be sure to return to, often.",1451260800,10,744,4.834645669291339

After meeting for a sexual encounter, the two young men set off on a road trip across rural Argentina to visit Jess estranged brother. After the first encounter between these 2 young men James wants more but Jess (Geronimo) didn't expect that and tells James to shut up and once James does Jess comments that he is submissive just as he likes and that leads to more time together. On the road they meet another man and they have a threesome. This is a short trip but one that brings a lot of things to light especially for Jess. This is a wonderful movie and lets you think about what these characters are thinking and what they are all about. Beautiful scenery adds to the movie, I have never and won't ever go to Argentina but I feel as though I have.
