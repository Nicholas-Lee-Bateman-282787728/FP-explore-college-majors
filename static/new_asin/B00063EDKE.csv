8037823,4,B00063EDKE,"Fun to watch and interesting just like Part One, which we also recommend. I can't really put my finger on why 4 stars instead of 5, except that perhaps some aspects were a bit corny. That said, it is entertaining and educational, and we are glad we purchased.",1402185600,,259,4.416666666666667
