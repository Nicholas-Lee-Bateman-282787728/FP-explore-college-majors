8170645,2,B00002SWEE,"Having seen the excellent picture quality of the Jack Benny Shows when they went to film in the mid fifties (there were 104 0f them), what a pity that these shows are taken from the kinescope versions - or are they kinescopes of the film versions, its hard to tell.  Jack Benny is great in the two programmes featured, but in 2002, shouldn't we get better picture and sound quality. Worth having, but a big disappointment.>",1034726400,14,423,4.565789473684211
8170646,5,B00002SWEE,"Coming from England,I took a risk in buying this dvd,not knowing that much about the artists. After seeing Jack Benny in his own show for the first time,I realised how fantastic he really was. His first episode Christmas shopping is the best,turning the clerk (Mel Blanc) into a nervous wreck! Jack Benny's second episode is about New Year. The Beverly Hillbillies Christmas Day episode is good,even if it's just to see Granny trying to figure out what she thinks is a washing machine,but is infact a tv. I'm sure Ozzie & Harriet never aired in England,it's not so much funny,but very strange acting,it's so innocent and wonderful, almost like another world compared to todays teen garbage,where morals are unknown. I do hope someone releases many more Jack Benny shows,and more American Christmas shows from the wonderful 50s.",987811200,35,827,5.043795620437956
