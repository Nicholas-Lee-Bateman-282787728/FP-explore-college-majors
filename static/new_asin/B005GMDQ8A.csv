8471869,4,B005GMDQ8A,I love to see mule deer and I have seen many in my hikes. Seeing them during hunting season is a special thrill to me. I think they are a beautiful animal. It is exciting to see the huge deer that roam the wilds. It is unfortunate that the public does not realize how beautiful these mule deer are and how devastating to the fawn crop coyotes and lions are. I hope we are able to see big mule deer when my Great Grand Kids roam the wilds and not just coyotes eating out of dumpsters.,1397433600,,483,4.041666666666667
