7860186,5,6304049463,"""Peachboy"" is a wonderful story about a young man named Rumotaru who engages on a journey along with an ape, a bird, and a dog, in order to save the children from a pack of ogres on the mountain. Sigourney Weaver's beautiful reading makes this story extremely exciting yet tender and Ryuichi Sakamoto's music brings the story an exotic feeling and makes the story extremely comforting to hear. I love this story because the main character of the story is courageous and friendly and only wants to see the children and his family again. All the children and the adults will love this story for it is considered the best Japanese children's story on the face of this planet.",1114214400,2,672,4.65546218487395
7860187,4,6304049463,"Although not an ""animated"" movie, it tells the story with rich, authentic-looking illustrations and is narrated very well by Sigourney Weaver.  The background music is good too, and helps evoke a sense of place.  Good intro to oriental music for the kids.
This whole ""Rabbit Ears"" series is very gentle and great for younger kids.  A nice break from the often manic and inferior storytelling on TV.  I liken them to really top notch ""Reading Rainbow"" presentations.  They are all worthwhile.",1073865600,2,491,5.012345679012346
7860188,5,6304049463,"Peachboy, a traditional Japanese tale with wide exposure in Japan, is narrated by Sigourney Weaver to superb music by Ryuichi Sakamoto. It is a heroic story of the finest character and would be enjoyed by many families. The film is both short, 30 minutes, and sparse - the tale is told with the camera focusing in on still pictures. No Disney characters here! Ms. Weaver's telling of the story makes the characters spring to life. Sakamoto's music carries the moment and all who watch will rejoice at the victory of good over evil. As a Japanese tale, I was pleased and surprised to see traditional Christian themes appear in this story. Along with the typical epic characterisitics of strength and bravery, Peachboy also contains elements of communion and resurrection - a bonus for Christian viewers! This film is a gem for any family with young children. A cassette soundtrack is also available with the narration/music on one side and the music alone on the other. My copy came with a poster depicting the action seen in the film.",1014163200,4,1034,4.814606741573034
