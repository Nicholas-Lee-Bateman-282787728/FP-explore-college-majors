Part one covers your major , minor and pentatonic scales, plus a few triads.

Part two brings in the blues scale, thumping and plucking, double thump, ghost notes and natural scales. I've only just begun to absorb the info on this disc, but it should keep me busy for a while. Of course, I'm taking it really, really slow- I typically learn one scale, technique etc, then practice that for a minute at a time between rounds while I play call of duty. I don't move on until it is solidly in my head, and I can play it well enough.",1274313600,,676,4.1923076923076925
