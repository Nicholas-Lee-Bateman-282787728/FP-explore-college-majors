8044319,5,B0006ZXJKC,We love Arthur. Marc Brown never ceases to amaze me and my family with his choice of topics for Arthur's adventures. Such well written stories with good morals. Kids's of all ages seem to relate to the stories. We have been reading them since my daughter was 2 1/2.,1361577600,,265,4.428571428571429
8044320,1,B0006ZXJKC,"This DVD is full of complaining and whinning! its terrible! I have a 2.5 year old and she started imitating the characters. Not to mention one of the episodes is about Buster the bunny and his mom. His mom is breaking up with her boyfriend and its all this drama that little kids, nor anyone really needs to watch. I just wanted some good wholesome videos that would teach some cute lessons. This Dvd went right into the trash. I don't need to fill my kids head with that stuff. Jesus Christ is the King and His return is drawing near!",1246147200,3,535,4.306930693069307
