8490614,5,B0060OQ4XW,One of those animes that you start watching and don't want to stop. On the second watch it is so much more engrossing because you watch as the characters change and know how they will be affected by the beginning.,1390780800,,213,4.35
8490615,5,B0060OQ4XW,"Blue Exorcist is exactly what you would expect from the new wave of anime. I highly recommend reading the manga first if you're into manga. Getting to watch the show after reading the manga is a juicy bonus. The idea of spirituality has an interesting take in this show. The characters go through a lot of hardship and survival. Humility saves them all. It's a riviting story you can't put down. Lot's of action, lots of mystery. (KURO SAN IS AWESOME!!!) ENJOY!",1360368000,,461,4.634146341463414
8490616,5,B0060OQ4XW,"I adore this show, it caught my attention very quickly with the humor, action, and interesting twist on a demon with a heart so to speak. I was really sad to see that they haven't put out a complete collection of this series, so sadly the only way to own it right now other than an import is through single dvd's which there are 4 in all. I love the covers, and slipcovers, it looks great on a shelf and it's clean and streamlined. The outer slipcases are a dark blue, and on the dvd case itself the picture is reversible (a different set of characters on each side). Each volume comes with a different poster (which is a superb bonus) that is double sided with a different picture on each side.

Overall a great release of the series, if you can't like me wait for the complete collection to come out.",1356998400,2,802,4.276315789473684
8490617,4,B0060OQ4XW,"Rin Okumura is a relatively nice guy, but he has temper control problems. Always getting into trouble fighting, and recently fired from his newest part time job, Rin's future doesn't look too bright. It gets darker when he discovers that he is the son of Satan and becomes the target of demons and exorcists alike. But its ok! He has a plan! He will become an exorcist and defeat Satan! Rin has the determination, but does he have the patience and fortitude to stay awake during class, finish his homework, and actually learn something? Probably not, but being the son of Satan does grant you some cool powers, so who needs to study?

I first heard about Blue Exorcist when it first started airing. I thought it sounded like pretty good fun, but I didn't expect it to be anything special. I put off watching it until there were a reasonable amount of episodes available, then I kind of accidentally started it. And once I started, I found it hard to stop. The premise is entertaining - half demon kid hides his identity and trains to defeat other demons. But in addition, it also has good, solid, likable characters, and humor that doesn't rely solely on stereotypes! I was surprised to find myself really liking Rin, sympathizing with his situation, and rooting for him to win. If that wasn't surprising enough, the supporting characters are also well developed individuals.

However, when the anime caught up with the manga and their paths diverged (I think this was around episode 15), things went downhill. I've never read the manga, but I assume it continued on with all the stuff I liked, while the anime took a turn towards the weird and messy ending. Don't get me wrong - I still enjoyed the show. I didn't hate the ending. But I was very disappointed. And the show fell a star. I went from planning to buy each of the expensive DVD volumes, to not wanting to buy any of them. If there is a boxed set available at a reasonable price I will probably pick it up. Otherwise this show will never grace my shelves.
I would still recommend the show to people. But I would also recommend checking your library for the DVDs or watching it on Crunchyroll.",1334707200,4,2154,4.577720207253886
8490618,3,B0060OQ4XW,"This review covers the entire series (though it's completely spoiler-free) and is divided into five parts: Plot, Animation, Music, Characters, and Overall. I'm going to assume you at least have a general idea of what the show is about (Amazon has a quick summary above), so I'll dive right into the review itself.

Plot: 5/10
Blue Exorcist had a lot of potential, I'll give it that. The opening episodes of BE are the best I've seen for any anime--there's no shortage of action, drama, intensity,  an ever thickening plot, and even a few characters deaths. It sets the tone for the rest of the story to come: dark, violent, and tragic. If Blue Exorcist had held to that promise, I'd give the story a solid 10 without any thought.
Unfortunately, the actual show ends up being quite different. After episode 3, the story slows to a crawl and goes down several notches; instead of the tight plot that was introduced in the early episodes, we're given a slice-of-life, episodic monster of the week series. Of course, it's pretty much a given that the story will slow down for a few episodes to show the main character's normal life, and then pick up again once the viewer is acquainted with the characters. The problem with BE is that it never picks up again; it's stuck in its slice-of-life rut for almost the rest of the series. Each episode is only loosely connected, with a very thin overarching plot (that being Rin trying to control his demon powers, if you can call that a plot). This in itself wouldn't be such a big deal, if it wasn't for the way the show was introduced; the series started out as a solid seinen and nose-dived into the realms of shounen.  Let me put it this way: the first three episodes remind me of Claymore, Higurashi, and Elfen Lied (in tone, not blood/gore). Everything after that is like Inuyasha, Naruto, or the first season of Bleach. It's almost as though the writer had this great tragedy in mind, but then the publisher knocked on their door and told them they had to tone it down. The result: a typical, clich-ridden shounen. Given what was promised at the start, this is a huge disappointment.
Even worse, BE ends up suffering from the same fate as many anime: ending before the ""end."" The manga of BE is still ongoing and is nowhere near ending, so of course our favorite animators decided to do what they think they can do but can't: come up with their own ending. The ending is completely rushed, ridden with plot holes, and fails to answer many of the questions raised earlier, which takes away the last shred of enjoyment. In short, what we're left with is a stereotypical shounen, a butchered ending, and lots of unfilled potential.

Animation: 8/10
Blue Exorcist's animation is exactly what you'd expect from a late 2000 anime series: smooth, fluid frame rates, decent shading, and a very stylized flair. While it's nothing we haven't seen before, it's consistent throughout the show. The fight scenes are drawn out well with minimal animation cheats (black screen with sword strike, straight on camera shots, etc), and are done from various angles to give the battles an intense feel. Unlike other anime that have tried this, BE doesn't suffer from character deformation or warping. Still, this no Soul Eater or Bleach, both of which dominate the shounen fighter genre; the battles lack variety and easily could have been cut and pasted over one another, as the same
effects and attacks are used every time. By the end, the fights have lost their freshness and seem far duller than they did at the beginning.

Music: 9/10
 Blue Exorcist sports the best soundtrack I've heard in a while, especially for the fight scenes and dramatic moments. There's no end of electric guitars, opera vocals, full-orchestrated pieces, and creepy chanting. The variety here is astounding, along with the high-quality work of each song.  The songs also have an equal amount of play time; there were never any that were overused or left under the table. The only weak part of the OST lies in the quieter scenes, as most of these songs are very forgettable and drab. However, the high-energy battle music more than makes up for this. If a soundtrack for this show is released, I'm buying it.

Characters: 4/10
Nothing new here. Almost all of the characters are card-board cut-outs ripped straight from the Shounen 101 Handbook. We have the rebellious, hot-blooded protagonist with the desire to protect, the protagonist's equally hot-blooded rival/friend, the ditzy, helpless love interest, the tsundere, the overprotective brother, the school teacher who's not all that they seem...if you've watched shounen before, you know how often these are recycled. BE's rendition of these characters is even more mundane due to the predictable character interactions and trite back stories; after reading the character list above, I'm sure you can easily spell out just how Character A will interact with C, or why tsundere is such a jerk all the time. In short, more clichs, and BE doesn't do a thing to step away from them.
I will say that there are a couple of interesting characters, namely Shura and Arthur. Their backstories are hinted at early in the series and seem to offer more than the stereotypical pasts of their peers. Due to the rushed ending, however, these backstories are never addressed again. Why did Shura have a demon sword? How did she meet Shiro in the first place? Why was Arthur so devouted to the Vatican? I appreciate some ambiguity, but in a show where most of the characters are lifeless, failing to follow through with the only unique characters is a huge blow.

Overall: 6.5/10
To sum up BE in a couple of words: Mediocre. Clich. Average. There's nothing here that even a newbie anime fan wouldn't have seen before. It's even more of a pity considering how the series started out; I can't help but wish I could take the first three episodes and write my own version of the story from there on. How such a great concept could be reduced to mere mediocrity is beyond me, but that's exactly what Blue Exorcist is. If you're looking for a seinen, this isn't it. If you're looking for a shounen, you could do much better. BE fails to satisfy either way.

UPDATE: If you're going to thumb down my review (as a few people have already done), would you mind dropping a comment and saying why? Silently thumbing down a review and walking away doesn't help anyone; I have no idea whether I made a mistake in my review or if it's merely the work of fanboys. Please let me know what you didn't find helpful so that I may address it.",1329091200,5,6565,4.715780296425458
