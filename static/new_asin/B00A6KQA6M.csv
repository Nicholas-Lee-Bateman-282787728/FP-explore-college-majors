5384275,5,B00A6KQA6M,This documentary is wonderful.  I am fairly a newbie in the sheep herding world.  My smooth coated border collie and I have been taking lessons herding for the past 2 years.  This film shows the incredible bond between dog and handler as well as the deep instinct and talents of these dogs.  Not only is the trial well filmed but the human interest aspect of following three of the handlers in their countries on their farms gives a great window into the daily lives of these people with their dogs.  The cinematography is beautifully done.  I recommend this movie to anyone.,1357171200,4,575,4.643564356435643
5384276,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This movie is  beautifully filmed, fun for those with birder collies, those who go herding, or anyone who wants to see dogs and the people they own doing what the are meant to do. Fun and informative.",1357171200,6,200,4.405405405405405

5384278,5,B00A6KQA6M,"Away to Me is a great documentary film, and not just for dog lovers. Although the DVD is a can't-miss gift for your canine-inclined friends, the film presents touching story lines too, even though it's all ""reality"" at its best. Loved everything, from the opening archival footage capturing the historic significance of the training of this extremely intelligent breed, all the the way through the special features.",1357171200,12,415,5.208955223880597
5384279,5,B00A6KQA6M,"I saw the premier of this during the summer. It is a very accurate portrial of sheepdog herding and sheepdog trials. It follows three top sheepdog handlers, Faansie Basson of South Africa; Haley Howard of California; and Amanda Milliken of Canada at their homes and at the Soldier Hollow (Oregon) sheepdog trial. If you are interested in border collies and sheep herding, you should enjoy this. Andrew Hadra did a wonderful and accurate job of directing this movie.",1354579200,24,465,4.9743589743589745
5384299,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This is an excellent DVD for seeing the working relationship, which can be developed between humans and canines.  Border Collies are far and away the most intelligent, self-motivated breed of dog and it takes your breath away to watch them herd nearly wild, free range sheep.  They have a zest for work and a zest for play; plus, they are the most steadfast loyal beings in God's creation.  Watch this before selecting a Border Collie to be sure you are worthy of sharing your life with one.  Quality filming, highly recommended.",1444435200,,529,4.78021978021978

5384324,5,B00A6KQA6M,We  thoroughly  enjoyed  viewing  this informative  and  beautifully  produced  story describing  the  tremendous  effort  that  is  required when  training  border  collies  to effectively  participate in Sheep  Herding  trials. The story  was  greatly enhanced  by  focussing  on three  very differently  and  interesting  personalities which  added  a  human  element  to  the story.  The frankness  and  honesty  of  the  three  different  trainers  made  viewing  this story  a  very  real  life  experience.,1412035200,,513,5.794117647058823

5384327,5,B00A6KQA6M,"I loved this film.  Away to Me was a fascinating look at the indescribable bond between dogs and people, one that is especially intense when it is also a working relationship.  I am relatively new to the world of sheepdog trials and this documentary took me right to the heart of it and four competitors.  The film profiled three handlers and their border collies and included an interview with a fourth in the bonus materials. Beautifully shot and edited, we learn the back stories of the three competitors and their border collies and follow their runs during the Soldiers Hollow Classic, an invitational and international sheepdog trial in Utah.  The film gave me the best seat in the house for all the action and festivities. The course and challenges the handlers and dogs had to deal with are explained in the film and bonus materials and supplied an impressive amount of information in a way that was engaging and enjoyable.  A real treat were the separate bonus commentaries on the winning run by the judge of the competition and the winning handler that gave unique insight into what they were thinking during the competition.  Also, the puppy training demonstration and the archival footage from a trial in London in the early 1900s were great additions.  I was especially moved by the handlers and their awe and respect for these intelligent and beautiful dogs.  Of course, I would highly recommend this film to any dog person and anyone interested in sheepdog herding and trials.  I would also recommend it to anyone who just wants a break from their day and to completely escape into a unique world filled with people who are passionate about what they are doing, with some gorgeous scenery, and absolutely amazing dogs. Bravo to all involved with the making of this this film and the people and dogs appearing in the film.",1408665600,,1836,4.803174603174603

5384341,4,B00A6KQA6M,"This movie starts out like a documentary, telling the story of a few different people and their Border Collies. Then it almost turns into a dog show as it shows the dogs competing in herding trials. I love seeing Border Collies do what they were born to do; to work and herd. It's nice to see true BC's working and herding sheep rather then seeing them prance around in a show ring. Fans of ""true"" working BC's will love this movie. It really shows what Border Collies can really do, and what they were born for. I'm happy to see that there are people out there keeping the breed on its real roots as a working dog. You can just see how happy they are during the herding trials. There's an extra that explains a little bit about raising and training young BC's to be around sheep too.",1396483200,3,784,4.304054054054054

That aside, this is a great flick!  My herding students and I watched it one day after training and loved it.  First, the cinematography is outstanding.  Second the stories are very interesting.  This is a dog story for anyone, herding fan or not.  Third, the extras are icing on the cake - hearing the judge's and handler's narration of the winning run is priceless!  This film gets SIX stars out of five LOL!",1378771200,2,634,4.508771929824562
5384363,5,B00A6KQA6M,"We loved this movie.  It was so much fun to relive our experience of watching the sheepdog trials at Soldier Hollow this summer.  In the movie, top handlers were chosen to demonstrate their methods of teaching and working their dogs and it was so good to see these amazing dogs up close and personal and to hear the signals coming from their handlers.  We loved everything about the movie: the dogs, the handlers, the photography and how it all flowed together.",1378684800,2,461,4.666666666666667

5384379,5,B00A6KQA6M,"I really enjoy watching working dogs, so I ordered this as soon as I heard about it.  The movie follows several dogs and their owners through training and a big herding competition.  There's a lot of fascinating information, and mostly some great shots of herding dogs at work.

My Australian Shepherd was absolutely enthralled!  He sat riveted, watching the screen, with occassional barks and yips during exciting parts...  and a couple of lunges at my TV screen to help head off some sheep.

Sit back with your dog (and some popcorn and dog treats) and enjoy the show!",1371859200,5,570,4.76530612244898
5384380,5,B00A6KQA6M,"I bought this video not knowing anything about it other than it featured Border Collies and their handlers working at the peak of performance. I have Border Collies, I follow trialing, and I can put up with a lot of poorly made work if it features either.

But I have a strong background in broadcast video and it instantly became obvious to me in the first few seconds of this work that this documentary is one stunning piece of video and story telling art.

The composition of every frame is perfect. Every shot is taken from a rock solid tripod. The sound is pristine. The story line is clear, with beautifully interwoven interview actualities. It is so well edited and focused that there is no narration at all. (If you can tell a strong story for 1 hr 38 min without needing to throw in some announcer voice over then you have pulled off a coup.)

This is video story telling at its highest level and the production team deserve to be buried in awards.

I would not hesitate to recommend this to people who normally have no interest in dogs. At its core it is a tale of how Border Collies and humans can fuse to become something more; a tale of transcendence.

This is not a sheep trialling instructional tape, it is not a dog training video, it is a piece of video art.",1371168000,3,1275,4.385593220338983

5384383,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This is not a documentary about Border collies. And it's not, at its core, a film about ""herding"" (working) sheep. So you don't have to own a Border collie, nor do you have to have gotten sucked into the world of sheepdog trialing, to appreciate this film.

Instead, it's a film about the relationship between dog and human: a relationship so profound that to attempt to describe it within the context of a review for Amazon would demean it. Sheepdog trialing is NOT ""obedience with sheep"". It's about the intense, fast-moving, three-way communication between handler, dog, and sheep, a relationship in which the dog is fully an equal partner with the handler, and (at least with the very best of dogs) assumes responsibility for its actions on the course.

This film captures many of the aspects of this relationship with exquisite sensitivity and sensibility. Even those whose four-legged companion is ""just a pet"" should watch this film, simply in order to see what their relationship with a canine is capable of attaining.

The story line is transfixing; the cinematography fabulous; the editing is perfect. Kudos to Drew Hadra, for a masterful first film! He is definitely someone to watch...

I do own/am owned by a Border collie. I often encounter individuals who, amazed at my dog's relationship with me, state ""I'm not even sure whether my dog knows its name"". Watch this film. Then watch the bonus material (alone worth the price of admission). It may open your eyes to the universe that is possible.",1367798400,21,1510,4.909803921568628

Neither of us knew much about sheep herding or trials, and were fascinated with the deep connection the handlers and the dogs share, and with the beauty of skill involved in working with sheep.

I had to learn about the trials the slow hard way.  The movie does an excellent job of explaining the trials and by showing three different trainers, shows there are different ways to arrive at the championship.  It shows the relationship between handler and dog can be unique and special.  Overall an excellent movie with a kicking sound track.",1358208000,4,521,4.733333333333333
5384436,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This is a beautiful film about herding dogs, their handlers, and how competing in trials brings an additional dimension to the wonderful stories about four people living with their Border Collies.  I think that some of the other reviewers really hit the nail on the head by mentioning that this DVD would make for a great family evening - most kids would absolutely love this film and the bonus tracks.  What I would add is that this DVD not only tells a wonderful set of stories and has first rate visuals and soundtrack, but that it shows the subtleties of the dogs' skills and trial performances, and explains course strategies and scoring in a way that few people ever understand from watching a trial in person.

I have been to a number of sheepdog trials and compete with my Borders in agility; I have observed at trials that people are fascinated by the abilities of the herding dogs and the amazing connection between dog and handler, but have a very hard time understanding the event, how it is scored, and what the dogs are doing right or wrong during their runs.  Much of the action takes place hundreds of yards from the observers and is barely visible, and there is no scoring done until the entire run is over and results posted, much later.  Many people watch a run or two and then come over to watch us demonstrate agility or head to the concessions, I think because it is difficult to really understand what is going on in a trial run.  This film does an amazing job of covering the dogs on course better than you will ever be able to see in person (think NFL games on TV with close-ups vs. in person from the upper deck)and the bonus tracks with the handler and judge's narratives are absolutely the best explanation of what is going on during the run that I know of.  I would have bought this DVD just for those tracks, but the movie itself is wonderful and the stories and subjects that it revolves around are, for me, very engaging.

Dog lovers, family film night, anyone who has ever tried to teach their dog a skill, and those who just enjoy magnificent scenery and wonderful stories about real people should pick this up.  Highly recommended, I hope there's more to come from the people who put this together.",1358121600,,2233,4.521091811414392

I'm SO in awe of this sport now, especially of the dogs and their trainers, the time it takes to excel, the bond between the trainers and their dogs, and the fact that these working dogs give their all--what in the world would people do without dogs?  They are the most wonderful creatures in the world and deserve our utmost kindness and respect. I have four dogs myself, and I cannot give them enough hugs and love.
I really enjoyed the personal day-to-day life of the trainers portrayed.  They are not just in it for the sport, the competition, the medal, etc. but truly have a wonderful and close relationship with their dogs and have a fulfilling life in addition to their involvement in their dogs and livestock.
Lastly, I also enjoyed the bonus features, which to me made it all come together as to the how's and why's of it all.  Truly educational and entertaining.  I will watch it again and again!!",1357603200,,998,4.527777777777778

When we saw the poster at the trials last year we got excited about seeing the movie.  I was in no way disappointed by what I saw when we watched the movie the other night.  The three handlers they followed live very different lives but they all obviously loved what they are doing, and we came to care about them.

Today I watched the special features that came on the DVD.  They were worth it in themselves.  Showing the gold medal run from the points of view of the audience, the judge and the handler added so much to my understanding of what goes into the trials.  I am going to watch the judge's commentary before we go to the Soldier Hollow Classic this year.

One last thing, as I was watching the segment on training young dogs my own dog came up and intently watched the TV for several minutes.  She has never been interested in the television before, so it was fun to see.  This movie really is for everyone.",1357603200,,1089,4.320197044334975
5384461,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This documentary is so well done. The cinematography is gorgeous, the soundtrack delightful, and all of that's before we even get to the subject of the documentary: Beautiful, intelligent, cooperative Border Collies herding sheep. The documentary follows a number of participants in the Soldier Hollow Sheepdog Classic in Utah both at home and as they compete.

Contestants from South Africa, Canada, the US and other countries work with their Border Collies in the age-old art of sheep herding. Along the way, you'll learn some of the commands (left, right, away, etc.) and the accompanying whistles that the humans use to communicate with their canines.

If you've had the fortune to see sheep dog trials in person or on television, some of this will be familiar ground to you. If you haven't, you'll be in total awe of how well these partnerships work out. One of the competitors describes the way the shepherd and the dog work together as a dance. Indeed it is, and what a beautiful dance.

I loved this movie and the extras on the DVD. Seeing a 12-week-old BC work with sheep was amazing!

I live with and write with a Border Collie named Angelo who sat on the couch with me as we watched the movie. He was just as enthused as I was. Now I just have to convince him that we really don't have enough land to keep sheep.

to conversations about the close and loving relationship between handler and dog a we witness three contestants prepare for the National Sheep-herding Finals in Heber, Utah. As only they (the handlers) understand how many things can go wrong in any event, Drew brings forth the message that the true passion of the sport, for the handlers, lies in the pure ""fun of the run."" The movie lays before you an idea of the level of expertise each dog and handler must have to qualify for this event. I'll never look at sheep-herding again without this new-found respect for it's participants.

What we didn't expect is that we would get totally hooked on it.  Watching these hard-working dogs run uphill at full speed and higher altitudes is incredible.  What's even more amazing is that the dogs manage the sheep without barking at or biting them.  The movie does an excellent job of portraying what these dogs do.  The only thing the movie doesn't show you is how hot it was during the filming at Soldier Hollow--an even greater testament to the dogs!  The three handlers that were featured really provided insight into the bonds they have with the dogs and how the dogs are trained.  Great movie.

5384479,5,B00A6KQA6M,"This is one breathtaking documentary film about sheepdogs and their handlers. Three handlers were accompanied by the camera to the famous ""Soldier Hollow Classic Sheepdog Trial Championship"" where many of the world's best sheepdogs take on Utah's wicked sheep on the toughest hillside in the US-West. It's not only the trial (competitive herding) in the foreground, but definitely a big part. It's about the strong relationship of the TEAM ""Dog-Handler"" and their lifes on the farm/ranch.
Nothing comparable out there! It's a must have, a collector's item anyway for all people around the globe.
The film brought a tear to my eye rolling across my cheek because of PURE JOY. Truly amazing - what would men be without dog! I appreciated the inputs of the days gone by at the beginning, the portrait of the different handlers at home and the emotional end with Scottish pipes and tartan as a part of the award ceremony.
You've all done such a great job that it was, is and will be an honour to watch the film again, again and again - Thank you so much!",1357344000,2,1050,4.711956521739131

I loved the ""at home"" interviews and seeing how the dogs are used at home. I also like the interview with Bill Berhow, and how he tried to explain the bond these dogs have with their handlers, how it is in some ways closer than a marriage and how you and the dog after working together daily for years, know what each other is going to do before they do it. I loved that they took video of the South Africa landscape and the dogs working there , got to say I wasn't expecting it to be so beautiful.

We see in this film a display of this intimate connection, where the working dog pleases the handler by following signals and whistles. No word is spoken, and ends are accomplished through mutual love and affection, discipline, respect and reward. Beyond this, the film shows one of the finest aspects of ranching life in the American West and around the world.",1357257600,5,441,4.815789473684211
5384483,5,B00A6KQA6M,"I've attended the Soldier Hollow Sheepdog Classic Championship for 10 years now and this film comes the closest to capturing the nature of the Border Collie's work.  The dogs are amazing and this documentary follows three handlers and their dogs.  You learn how the dogs work to the handler's commands and see how differently each of the handlers approaches this task.

The extras provided include the winning run, along with a commentary by the owner and the judge of that run.  You'll also get to see three puppies in the beginning stages of being trained to work with sheep.

The three successful handlers couldn't have more different styles and attitudes towards their dogs.  You'll enjoy hearing their philosophy about working with dogs and sheep.

It also shows parts of the runs at Soldier's Hollow of some of the top handlers and dogs. (Saw my dog's daddy in one of the segments!) This movie really lets you see what herding is all about and the tremendous skill required of the dog/handler team.

5384485,5,B00A6KQA6M,"The opening of the film is an early black and white British newsreel about a sheepdog trial.  It's entertaining from a sheepdog handler's point of view to watch the kneeling competitor direct his dog to put sheep in a pen that he was standing a few feet away from - not holding on to a pen rope.  In an interview, the handler  turns out to be the great Alex Millar.
The film then turns to modern day.
It follows three sheepdog handlers from three different countries to their destination at the Soldier Hollow Classic Trial at Midway, UT.  Although this movie is about sheepdog handlers, it's not really about the dogs.  It is more about these three people from different places who's lives are shaped by their love of herding.  Amanda Milliken from Ontario, Canada is eccentric and humorous at her beautiful farm.  There is no doubt that Amanda's dogs are well loved and the center of her life.  Faansie Basson from South Africa, is composed and noble as he speaks about his daily work that is dependent upon his dogs.  The heart of the film is Hailey Howard, from Northern California.  Hailey's class and beauty are accented by the great vistas of the mountains and high desert of her home.  We feel like we are her best friend as she shyly tells us of her courtship by her cowboy fiance. In the background of these characters is their bond with their dogs and it's this that brings them all together.
The film has some beautiful images of the world that these handlers live in with a strong Western thread.  The climax of the film is at the Soldier Hollow trial and we are led along with their runs by the great narration of Ray Crabtree as he explains it for the spectators at the trial.",1357171200,7,1691,4.490196078431373

You gain insight into what training goes into a Trial for the dogs and the handlers by following three competitors from three countries. Each with seperate techniques trying to achieve the same goal: Championship. We have sponsored Sheepdog Trials and have attended them for over sixteen years. We have also owned Border collies for fourteen years. For us it was great fun to see our friends competing. But anyone interested in learning about border collies, sheepdog trials and the people who compete will do so and be entertained in this well paced and told story. On the bonus feature of the winning run there are three audios to choose from. It is facsinating to listen to the trial judge explain the reasons for deducting points from a run. Equally interesting to hear from the winning handler what was going through his mind at certain points in the course. A game of strategy between human, dog and sheep.
