8592403,5,B0006877L6,This is a very good dvd for the young magician who is just starting out .  The tricks are simple and the teaching is good as well. Highly recommended!,1475712000,,150,4.172413793103448
8592404,5,B0006877L6,"This is the third MagicFrank DVD I have, and like the others, consists of 21 tricks you can learn quickly and easily.  (other magic dvd's have maybe 9-15 tricks, tops)  The emphasis here is like the Magic4Fun DVD, where there is a mix of card tricks and ones where you only need household items.  MagicFrank places an emphasis on building children's self-esteem, and this DVD is great for that shy little one you have.  Soon your child (or you!) will be performing magic in front of crowds without a second thought.  Buy this DVD!",1110153600,7,530,4.595744680851064
