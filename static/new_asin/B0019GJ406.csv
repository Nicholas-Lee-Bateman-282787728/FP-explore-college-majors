8273995,5,B0019GJ406,"This is an exellent collection of black and white movies starring Richard Attenborough.
I especially enjoyed ""The ship that died of shame"" always a favorite of mine, Dunkirk was really good with John Mills.
and the quality of all the movies in this collection were excellent,
If you are a fan of Attenborough then you need this collection.",1345075200,3,339,4.862068965517241
