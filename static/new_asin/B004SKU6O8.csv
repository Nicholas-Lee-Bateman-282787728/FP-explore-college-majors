Nos encanto este groupo de DVDs.  Esta  mejor que la primera parte--llena de suspenso.  Sigue a varios personajes y tramas.  Lo recomendamos totalmente y no nos gusto que se terminara.",1388620800,,345,5.277777777777778

4463951,3,B004SKU6O8,"The video and packaging are great i'll give them that but I hate when companies decide to cut everything out of a show. If they do it to not use so many dvd's charge $5-$10 more, i'll gladly pay it knowing that im seeing the show how it was meant to be seen. You never know if you just missed a minor detail or something crucial in the plot, because of this you'll be watching a scene and in the next episode people pop out of no where across the country or people who have never met before are now best friends or enemies, and you miss everything that lead to that. It's frustrating. If you're in the US you can watch this series legally without anything cut out just search mun2 el cartel la guerra total. I wish I would've known that instead of wasting $15 on something that's highly edited.

No gasten su dinero! La calidad es excelente pero le cortan como 10 minutos a cada capitulo y uno se pierde de muchas escenas importantes.",1345161600,2,934,4.27683615819209
