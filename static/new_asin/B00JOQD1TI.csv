8652628,1,B00JOQD1TI,"One of the worst movies in the history of bad movies. Would be laughed at as a high school movie, beyond the valley of amateurish. Everything about this movie is bad, the script, the photography, the acting and maybe above all, the editing! whoever made this travesty should go to film school, something that doesn't seem to have happened. This tops my list of the worst ever.",1416960000,,376,4.626865671641791
