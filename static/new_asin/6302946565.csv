524849,3,6302946565,"Tapping into the youth culture of the mid-1960's, I'LL TAKE SWEDEN (1967) showcased Bob Hope as the harrassed father of a beautiful blonde teen, whose decision to take a business re-posting in Sweden opens an even bigger can of worms...

Bob Holcomb (Bob Hope) is severely worried about the future wellbeing of his teenage daughter JoJo (Tuesday Weld), when she announces her plans to marry unemployed ""trailer-rat"" Kenny Klinger (Frankie Avalon).  On the spur of the moment, Bob arranges to relocate his business base to Sweden, and drags JoJo along for her own protection from randy American lads.  In Sweden, the land of IKEA, teeny-tiny cars and...*gasp* even looser morals concerning sex...Bob once again faces the unthinkable when JoJo is keenly pursued by one of his young business associates, Erik (Jeremy Slate).  In desperation, Bob calls Kenny over from the States...

It takes a while to gather steam, but I'LL TAKE SWEDEN is a charming romantic comedy.  Dina Merrill co-stars as Karin Granstedt, Bob's new Swedish love interest, and adds a great deal of elegance and dignity to the proceedings.  It would have been marvellous had the producers managed to snag someone like Ingrid Bergman for the role, but I think Ms Merrill does just fine.  She also shares a delightful chemistry with Hope.

Frankie Avalon and Tuesday Weld, two of the hottest ""teen idol"" talents of the day, are fresh and appealing; Avalon sings the title song along with several other musical numbers that give the movie something of a ""Beach Party"" flavour.  A fun way to spend 90 minutes.

524850,4,6302946565,"I can only imagine what Swedish people made of this movie way back when but anyone who watched it in the US must have had the urge to go there, for the amazing cinematography shows us a land without a single flaw--well, maybe some of the architecture looks a little bland.  Jeremy Slate (as Erik, the Swedish lothario) is driving Tuesday Weld (as JoJo, the American surfer girl) on a tour of Stockholm in a bright red Volkswagen, pointing out all the scenic sights, and he says, ""And there is our Royal Palace, of which we are very proud.""  The screen shows a squarish and rusty building that looks as though it were part of a drinking fountain.  Tuesday Weld looks sour as she replies, ""You must be very proud.""  Actually I wonder if any of the stars made it to Sweden, for they could easily be on Hollywood sound stages or up in the hills around LA when they are supposed to be consorting in resort hotels in Sweden.

The movie gets a little tiresome with Bob Hope's obsession, that is, preserving JoJo's virginity at all costs.  He seems like a man with an idee fixe and it isn't very healthy.  Still he encounters an interesting and opposing point of view, that of Karin, the decorator (Dina Merrill), whose divorce has given her a melancholy wispiness, a divorce she blames entirely on the fact that she and her husband were ""strangers"" to each other sexually speaking when they wed.  Thus, she like every other Swede in the story, is avidly in favor of premarital sex as a way of testing relationships.  I wonder if Britney Spears saw this movie...  she seems to have drawn on it for relationship advice as well as for fashion tips.

God made the fashions in this movie, God and Paula Giokaris, the little remembered designer responsible for some of the 1960s most outlandish screen costumes.  Here there is always something fantastic to watch in every frame.  Just the little pink hat in which you first see Dina Merrill would be enough to establish her in the couteriere's hall of fame: the hat that has nothing to do with the yellow skirt and blouse thing Merrill is wearing.  Tuesday Weld has one amazing outfit after another; one of the best is a black lame evening gown with Nolan Miller bugle beads and witchy, Steve Nicks style white egret feathers at the end of each sleeve: it looks like a pack of white birds is trying to swallow each of Tuesday's hands.

Jeremy Slate spends the last half of the film trapped in an iridescent plaid-ish sort of sport jacket with subtle rainbow shades of green, blue, violet, and aqua--he looks like a walking rain forest.  I can't even describe the various off-white and cream colored suits Bob Hope gets to wear, but Giokaris' masterpiece has got to be the baby blue speedo she manages to encase what looks like plenty of Frankie Avalon in.  I had never really thought much of Frankie as an actor before, but seeing him stand up in this baby blue swimsuit, I've changed my mind.  It;'s the kind of swimsuit any other man who found himself wearing it would be trying to hide, all bunched up in a knot in some shady corner of the set.  But Frankie not only stands up in it, he prances around singing a complete title tune number, on a wooden float overlooking a beautiful Swedish lake and surrounded by two and a half dozen Swedish beach bunnies in wonderful swimwear.  ""I'll take Sweden, ja, ja, ja,"" is the theme of the song and indeed of all of fashion history ever since then.",1231027200,,3430,4.519417475728155

I can't decide what was worst: the very dated plot, the overacting, the literally laughable special effects, or the worst Swedish I have ever heard!

524854,1,6302946565,"Wow, this movie is bad.  I'm a huge Bob Hope fan, and I really like some of his later films... The Private Navy or Sgt. O'Farrell, How to Commit Marriage.  But this movie is the PITS!  The story centers around Bob's surf goddess daughter and the obsession Bob holds for her virginity.  Uncomfortable.  People who where alive for the sixties may be amused by how incredibly off-base this movie's depiction of the era's youth culture is, and fans of music will dig the lyrics to the films title song, as crooned by Frankie Avalon:  ""I'll never get bored, of smorgasbord, I'll take Sweden, ya-ya-ya.""  So, so bad.  But it is a shade away from craptastic.",1121472000,4,651,4.6
524855,3,6302946565,"This film is in the style of Doris Day films that feature compromising sexual situations and innuendo while on the surface everything remains innocent fun. That may have been titillating in 1965 when you couldn't say the word ""pregnant"" on TV and Rob and Laura Petrie had separate beds, but now it's just boring and adolescent. I get tired of this innuendo quickly, but it's always fun explaining each joke to my wife, because the entire thing goes way over her head.

This film features blatant sexual material centering around the question of Bob Hope's daughter: will she or won't she?

The film presents Sweden as a sexually free place, while America stands for a higher morality. On the surface the movie preaches this higher morality while actually presenting and capitalizing on the intriguing images and ideas of a free-lovin' society.

One problem with this type of film is that the writers think that the innuendo will carry the film. They think that just the fact that they are covertly, or in this case, overtly, talking about sex will keep us nervously giggling and entertained, gasping in shock or winking at each other. It's like a comedian whose act relies on dirty language. Ok, they may get nervous laughs, but after some time it gets boring or even distasteful. In this film, because the writers are overconfident, they don't bother with good characters, a good plot, clever dialog, motivations, or any thing else that makes for good drama or comedy, they just let the subject of sex carry it. That just doesn't cut it, especially not in modern times when any shock value it might have had is completely gone.

An example of good writing is ""Frequency,"" where the writers did not assume that a time travel gimmick would carry a weak story, but instead gave us a long eventful ride with a triple your money's worth climax in addition to the front and center gimmick.",1059609600,3,1884,4.769938650306749
524856,1,6302946565,"First, let me say that I am a true Bob Hope fan. He is the funniest man who ever lived and ranks up there with WC Fields and the Marx Brothers as an immortal comedic deity.  In fact, his was the first celebrity autograph that I got back in 1973.  I think that he was a true comic genius and a consummate old-world gentleman and a wonderful, selfless, giving human being who never forgot his humble roots.  I have most of his films on DVD and think highly of him and his work as an entertainer.

But, I have to admit, in all honesty, that I hated this film.

I realize that in 1966 when this film was made, it was designed to make teenagers appear as revolting, obnoxious undercurrent denizens who would ruin the established, tried-and-true American way of life; but this portrayal of teenyboppers was too much for me to stomach.  I was only 14 years old when this film came out so, theoretically and demographically, I should have identified with its teen characters, but I didn't then and I don't know.  I hated the teenagers portrayed in it.

Frankie Avalon's character is disgusting and sickening to the max and beyond.  He is a total, burned out pre-hippie, beach bum idiot with no redeeming qualities what-so-ever.  If he were after my daughter as he is after Tuesday Weld (herself then 22 years old and still playing Hope's adolescent offspring), I would take him out and execute him and go to prison for homicide rather than let him get his hands on her - even if she wants him to.  When Avalon was almost 30 years old, he played a teenaged recreational drug abuser in the terrible, banal, insipid and pedestrian film HORROR HOUSE in 1969.  At the end of that film, he got stabbed in the balls by the homicidal maniac villain.  It's too bad that this didn't happen to him in real life before he made I'LL TAKE SWEDEN.

Tuesday Weld is a pre-flower child simp and to say her character is vapid is high praise and much too charitable.  If she and Avalon were supposed to represent clichs of the counterculture generation they did a good job as shiftless, aimless, MINDLESS, mentally deficient trash who accept abject stupidity as the norm (as well as accepting bad ""music"") and wear it as a badge of identity.

Jeremy Slate appears as the ultimate lecherous Euro trash lothario and it makes one wonder how - in a cinematic world that then (in the 1960s) still sought handsome, virile, desirable, good-looking men as male leads - that someone as physically repulsive as he was could get a role as a romantic lead.

Dina Merrill plays Hope's possible love interest and her phony Swedish accent is as obviously pathetic and fake as Slate's is.

I seem to remember watching - or at least trying to watch - this film when it was released to television in the late 60s or early 70s.  But this time around, I only made it through the first 40 minutes of its 97 minute running length time before shutting it off in disgust and revulsion and going to another film in this Bob Hope set of DVDs.",1394668800,2,2989,4.491682070240295
524857,4,6302946565,Not one of my all time favorites... but not bad.  The sexual innuendos are a bit much for youth... but by today's standards very tame.,1375833600,,134,4.36

524860,1,6302946565,"By 1965, Bob Hope stopped trying when it came to his movie career - cranking out an endless stream of dreadful comedies. Rapid Robert's downward spiral began with the misguided ""I'll Take Sweden."" Everyone has seen better days, including director Frederick de Cordova (who wisely traded in low-budget cinema for ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson""). Frankie Avalon's title song is cringeworthy.",1338249600,5,400,5.467741935483871
524861,3,6302946565,"Bob Hope is a father trying to keep his daughter from growing up too fast, in I'll Take Sweden (1965) a romantic comedy that explores both the sexual morality of different generations, as well as different cultures.

Single parent, and oil company exec Bob Holcomb (Hope), returns home from a business trip and discovers that his daughter JoJo (Tuesday Weld) intends to marry Kenny Klinger (Frankie Avalon), a guy who lives in a trailer, and who's primary talents appear to be singing, and riding a motorcycle.  Looking to put an end to the romance, Holcomb takes an assignment in Sweden, and brings his daughter along.

JoJo's depressed spirits are lifted when she meets Erik Stenson (Jeremy Slate), a handsome playboy type who works at her father's firm.  While Holcomb was looking to cool things in the romance department, the liberal atmosphere in Sweden seems to have the opposite effect on both daughter and father, as Bob finds himself smitten with Karin Grandstedt (Dina Merrill), an interior designer who is redecorating Holcomb's residence.

Morality has a double standard, in this sex comedy directed by Fred DeCordova (The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson).  We observe that love is not very predictable, no matter how much a father meddles.  Upset that Erik plans to take JoJo away on a tryst, Bob has Kenny hop on a Lufthansa Air flight to Sweden, so he can try to win JoJo back.  But this does not go as planned either.  After forbidding his daughter from running off, Bob and Karin slip away to a resort, the same place that Erik and JoJo have also sneaked off to, setting the stage for the film's comedic conclusion.

I'll Take Sweden is mostly a light fun romp that has an agitated Holcomb trying hard, but not succeeding in managing the situation.  Tuesday Weld (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looking-for-Mr-Goodbar-VHS/dp/6300216853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looking for Mr. Goodbar [VHS</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Poison/dp/B000G6BLY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Poison</a>) is very solid, as is Jeremy Slate as the amorous Swede.  Dina Merrill is a good match with Hope, though her Swedish accent isn't always convincing.  Frankie Avalon provides a teen appeal, but his musical numbers while certainly energetic, do not have the greatest lyrics.  The film is included in the Bob Hope MGM Movie Legends Collection, providing an alternate way to acquire the film.",1325980800,,2490,5.501312335958005
524862,1,6302946565,My wife and I are long time Bob Hope fans so naturally we sought out all of his movies. It's unfortunate that Mr. Hope consented to play this role because this movie is the absolute bottom of the barrel for Bob Hope. The whole movie revolves around finding someone to have sex with and the comedy is just poorly written. It's sad to say that long time Bob Hope fans should never see this one.

524865,4,6302946565,"The Bob Hope character never really aged but the body and film parts did. Here he plays the single father of a teen-aged daughter who, in the traditional way, was having trouble adjusting. The problem for the viewer in 2010 is pretty much the same as the problem one would have watching (or reading about) Marjorie Morningstar deliberating as to whether she should surrender her sacred virginity before marriage. Happily, no writers for Bob Hope would dare slip in a serious three minutes, perhaps they would be allowed one, if there were a big laugh punch line following it. Of course, these are not kids abusing illegal substances, living in communal cesspools, or being hassled by the police for a variety of ""out of their mind"" deviances. They are kids who are doing early rock and roll and some of the fun dances of the day. Who could accuse the Frankie Avalon and Tuesday Weld of this film of anything worse than....well, perhaps it was the fate worse than death. At any rate, the film is very light fun with Dina Merrill looking beautiful, Tuesday Weld being a model upper middle class teen-ager in love with the next good looking guy who comes her way, and Bob Hope, being the bewildered, funny, father who still gets his girl as well.

But Bob doesnt realize that Sweden is a lot more liberal as far as romance goes. Bob manages to fall for attractive interior decorator Karin Granstedt (Dina Merrill), but once again has to interfere in his daughters love life when shes pursued by notorious Swedish lothario Erik Carlson (Jeremy Slate).

The 1965 film is an excuse for Hope to make wisecracks and sarcastic comments. The story is negligible and attempts to titillate with a milieu of sexual freedom but is constrained by the Production Code, still in effect at the time (it would collapse three years later). The Nat Perrin screenplay comes off as kind of creepy, with the father a little too concerned with his daughters love life.
