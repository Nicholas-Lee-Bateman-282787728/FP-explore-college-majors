Overall, a very good representation.  What would have given it a five star rating?  Better
acting, but more importantly, when doing the exorcism, speaking directly to and confronting
the powers of darkness in the name of Jesus Christ.  However, since the couple is portrayed as being somewhat weak in the faith, it is understandable that they speak in a more indirect way while saying the prayers that are intended to rid their home and lives of demonic presence.

This is a courageous and successful attempt at covering this topic.  Recommended viewing.",1354406400,,640,4.94392523364486

I think the info in this video review will be helpful in deciding whether to purchase this DVD or not. This is one of those DVD's where the bonus features are just as interesting & entertaining as the film itself! NOTE: Because there are scary elements in this movie, it may not be suitable for younger audiences (elements explained in video review).

8366997,1,B002EAJNHU,"This dvd movie is so stupid, I rate a grade F if I was grading it like homework. This movie put me to sleep it didn't keep in suspense and the actors need more trainging on there acting careers. This move wasn't worth spending a penny on it but there will be other people who will like it but that is ok I don't care for this and I felt I waisted my money",1254009600,,355,3.810810810810811
