8104886,4,B000E373OE,"The Bill Kurtis hosted AMERICAN JUSTICE episode ""Dealing with the Devil,"" is the sickening story of a violent sociopath, Marion ""Mad Dog"" Pruett, who while in a Federal prison cut a deal that got him into the Witness Protection Program. Pruett revealed the name of his informant cellmate's murderer. Entry into the program protected him from possible retribution from other criminals, but it also shielded Pruett's true identity and his long rap sheet from city and state police forces.

While he was living in New Mexico under the assumed name of biker Sonny Pearson, Pruett brutally murdered his common law wife and burned her remains in the desert. With the US government uncooperative and the name Sonny Pearson showing NO PRIOR ARRESTS, local police could do nothing about their main suspect in this murder.

And that's where the story really begins, a trail of homicides and bank robberies in several states committed by this maniac who later claimed his 4K a week coke habit had made him insane. Find out in this 45 minute series chapter just what crimes he committed, how Pruett was finally apprehended and what ultimately became of him.",1445212800,,1145,4.958333333333333
