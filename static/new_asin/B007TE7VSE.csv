I would write a more detailed description, but I figure I shouldn't waste anymore time on writing about it as I did watching it...as I struggled through about 40 minutes before cutting it off. Those looking for a modern take on ""House Party"" should keep right on looking.

A VHS version of ""House Party"" is FAR superior to this High-Definition disaster.",1360713600,,452,5.026666666666666

5897769,3,B007TE7VSE,"Hendrix (Mandela Van Peebles) is a high school student. He works at parties as a DJ to earn money to buy a car. He has done the guy thing and entered into a ""first one to loose their virginity"" contest with 4 friends. Meanwhile he wants to date Cheyenne (Simone Battle) the Phoebe Cates of this teen movie. Cheyenne's dad (Michael Jai White) is a policeman and won't allow his daughter to date anyone below a 3.5 grade average. Hendrix makes an arrangement to have Cheyenne tutor him so he can get his grade point average up and take her to the prom.

The film also has some party rappers, an up skirt cell phone cam, a school project that interfaces with poor people, and a token 20 year old near thug (Y.G. who pays C.C.) in class. Snoop Dog listed in the credits has a minor role.

Peebles has no problem quoting Malcolm X (just called Malcolm in the film to fool us white folk) and gives a grand lecture on consumerism, aimed at both Hendrix and the audience. The acting and story line were just fine, it just seems to be underdeveloped. Maybe I have just outgrown these films.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-Bomb, off screen sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars",1344643200,5,1145,4.3915094339622645

8602806,5,B007TE7VSE,"This movie is not for kids but it has all elements of a great movie. It has a good plot, good acting, it's funny, great soundtrack, and the story is good too. The only thing troubles me is one of the actors is supposed to be attracted to an actress who in real life is his sister. But that doesn't take from the movie in anyway so disregard that haha. I say it's worth a look if you're ok with a story based on a younger generation.",1392336000,,432,3.9770114942528734
8602807,5,B007TE7VSE,"Saw this movie on BET and I think it's a realistic display of the things that children go through, now. The young actors are really good and I think this movie would even do well as a series!",1377475200,,191,4.052631578947368

8602809,5,B007TE7VSE,"Let me begin by saying ""know history"" what was the first movie made about blackmen  for black people? ""Sweetback,Sweetback Badass Song"", it changed Hollywood for those mentioned. Melvin did it for everyone. Mario attempts to pay ""Raspect"" to his Dad and keep it honest with his children. If you watch the movie and know ""true story"" you will see how deeply moving this movie is for Black men and black people.",1372377600,,409,4.76056338028169

8602811,4,B007TE7VSE,I truly enjoyed watching this movie.  The mesage that it is sending out to our younger adults about the company you keep is important.  To treat people the way you want to be treated at all times.  I will watch again and share with others that visit me and want to watch movies.,1366588800,2,278,4.2075471698113205
