Some things I liked:  Some moves help build balance.  The moves build muscle while being a good cardio workout.

Things I didn't like:  Warm up was too long.  Some of the combo routines were too slow.",1271116800,,370,4.352941176470588
8292890,5,B001DDY6X0,"Lynn has done it again. I recently purchased ""Punch"" which I loved, so I thought I would try ""Kick"".

There are two workouts and one can do one or the other or combine them.

There is a modifier for those who would like to keep this low-impact.

The moves are designed to get the heart rate up but without a lot of fancy moves, so the learning curve is not a long one.

I highly recommend this DVD",1228262400,,397,4.051282051282051
