8251717,3,B0013LCO6S,"This video is a the story of the 2001 season, not the actual game.  It is narrated by Martin Sheen and the story is told by Adam Vinatieri, Tom Brady and Lawyer Milloy.  I enjoyed the video, but was hoping to see the game or highlights.  The highlights in the video are few and just punctuate the stories.  It's okay and I would recommend it to Patriot fans, but don't expect to see the game.  This video has no bonus material.",1495238400,,427,4.222222222222222
8251718,2,B0013LCO6S,I thought I would be watching the entire game the real McCoy  not other people talking about it. I only watched a few minutes.,1494288000,,126,4.25

8251720,1,B0013LCO6S,"What a joke. I bought 4 of these dvds for my husband for x mas. We opened the first one today and was quite surprised to find out that this is not the super bowl game itself.  It's a stupid commentary from the couches and a couple players with snipers of the game. I believed thsee dvds to be the actual games. I'm very upset.  I paid $57 for 4. Who cares what people had to say about the game, we wanted to WATCH the game. What a scam.",1485648000,,436,3.8876404494382024

8251723,4,B0013LCO6S,"I chose this dvd for my husbands' birthday, this NE Patriot's Superfan LOVED it. The highlights of the games to the lead-up of the Super Bowl was almost as exciting as seeing the whole season for the 1st time. & of course, that Super Bowl victory, a game that now, with this dvd, we can watch again & again. Well done!!",1443225600,,319,4.245901639344262
