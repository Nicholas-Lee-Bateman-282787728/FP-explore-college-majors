Englund cast great actors in this movie such as Andy Milonakis and Hector Jimenez. One of my favorite scenes is when Doug and Craig see Joey Lawrence dead and they say ""Joey Lawrence came to our party!"" and then they do a queer sissy high five. LMFAO!!!! This movie has some racist moments such as when they first go to their house and the 3 guys see what they think is the Grim Reaper and Doug says ""..I think it's just a Mexican.""

Some of the credit naturally goes to director Robert Englund, but it's really the cast who carry this movie on their backs without ever letting it fall or flounder.  The trio of losers at the center of the story could easily have become tediously annoying or unbearably stupid, but that just doesn't happen.  Heck, I actually liked these guys.  Yes, this is definitely a dumb comedy with horror overtones, and, yes, it will primarily appeal to adolescent males, but that doesn't mean that the rest of us can't enjoy it, too.

After some initial housing problems, local real estate agent Winnie (Bobby Lee) hooks them up with a sweetheart of a deal - a low-cost mansion located at 666 Perdition Road.  The place is a portal to hell, but the guys think the fiery pit in the basement is a sewage problem and blame homeless ""squatters"" (like the Mexican dude who keeps trying to warn them that the devil lives there) for whatever problems creep up.  With bodaciously fine neighbors like Lucy (Emily Foxler) and her friends Delilah (Noureen DeWulf) and Jezebel (Corri English), these guys aren't going anywhere.  In fact, they start planning a killer party for their killer pad, hoping to score major points (or really just to score, period) with the girls.

It is a truly happening party.  Lucy managed to get Demon Semen to perform (the girls just love Demon Semen, don't you know), and the partygoers include a bevy of beauties (including a couple of porn stars and a gang of Catholic school girls) and even Joey Lawrence (as himself).  Unfortunately, as the party really begins to heat up, a series of unfortunate, freak party ""accidents"" leave several people quite dead - but the guys aren't going to let a little thing like that ruin such a killer party, especially since they haven't scored with their hot chicks yet.  Will the guys ever realize what is really going on inside their house?

Quite frankly, I don't understand this film's R rating.  There is no nudity to speak of (apart from a couple of male back sides), the language is far from extreme, most of the toilet humor is limited to one scene, and none of the deaths are really gory.  I don't like the DVD box cover, either, as it makes the film look cartoonish.  It's dumb, but it's not cartoonish.

Obviously, some viewers consider Killer Pad to be unwatchable rubbish, but I loved it.  Maybe some, seeing that the film was directed by Robert Englund, expected this to be a horror film, and others just didn't appreciate the type of humor on display here.

8234437,2,B000YV1Q3U,"Robert Englund, a man most of us know as Freddy Kruger, directs the Horror/Comedy entitled ""Killer Pad"". Englund does an ok job having fun with the genre and the script by Dan Stoller has about one real laugh, everything else is just silly one liners and lame fart jokes that we could easily have found on Nickelodeon. There are some amusing side characters played namely by Joey Lawrence, Hctor Jimnez and Andy Milonakis but they aren't big enough stars to really drive the picture home. The one really humorous part in the entire movie is when Joey Lawrence does his impression of Bruce Willis, it really is almost uncanny. To get to the plot of the movie, three friends buy a huge house in the Hollywood Hill's, the only problem is the devil lives in the basement. The friends decide to throw a house warming party, but since the devil lives in the basement people at the party start dieing and things start going terribly wrong. In premise this sounds like there should be a lot of fun involved, and ""Killer Pad"" is at times a pretty amusing ride but not very much at all sticks or is worth watching again. Watching this movie again would be a fate far worse then death. This being said I did semi enjoy myself, for about five minutes, when the end credits started rolling. One aspect that really detracts from the overall enjoyment of the movie is the stupidity of the all the characters. Dan Stoller made the three main characters so stupid and idiotic that it's almost unbearable to watch. There is Boss battle against Satan at the end of the movie to the sounds of KISS but it's really anti-climactic and just frustrates me even more. I expected more from Robert Englund who is so seasoned in the genre, and although he does do an ok job of directing his actors, because the acting wasn't terrible, the question I find myself asking is why on earth Englund would have agreed to have anything to do with this movie. The real flaws are in Stoller's script, in which he keeps giving the same jokes over and over. I expected more from Daniel Franzese, who in this played Doug, one of the idiotic poorly written leads. It's sad to see Daniel Franzese in such a horribly unfunny role when we've seen him so funny as Damien in Mean Girls. The other leads, played by Eric Jungmann and Shane McRae do what they can with such a poorly written script. Aside from the horrid script the next biggest problem is this movie does not deserve its ""R"" rating. If this movie was going to get an ""R"" rating anyway I expect more nudity, blood, gore, raunchy humor, or something to hold the ""R"" rating or even my complete attention, but instead we are left with a movie that barely should have earned a ""PG-13"".

8234439,4,B000YV1Q3U,"Killer Pad (Robert Englund, 2008)

I rip on bad horror movies all the time, but I'll tell you what--I'm a sucker for a bad horror movie that's played for its badness, and I have been ever since discovering such classic horror parodies as Night of the Creeps and Return of the Living Dead back in the eighties. The latest one to cross my path is Killer Pad, the second feature directed by Robert Englund (the first, way way back when, was the cult hit 976-EVIL...and I'll bet three-quarters of those reading this are too young to get what that was a reference to). Yeah, Robert Englund. Freddy Krueger. You know the guy. So the director hasn't made a movie (behind the camera, anyway) in twenty years. What about the scriptwriter? Dan Stoller, a former production assistant turning his hand to writing a script for the first time. Oh, yeah, this is gonna be good.

Surprisingly, it is.

Three friends from suburban Chicago, Doug (Mean Girls' Daniel Franzese), Craig (Not Another Teen Movie's Eric Jungmann), and Brody (relative newcomer Shane McRae, who will be in the upcoming adaptation of monster literary hit The Help), flee their parents' houses for various reasons (which we can't get into here) and head for Los Angeles. After they're turned down for the rathole where they already paid their deposit because they have a pet, they come across Winnie (MADtv's Bobby Lee), a shady real estate agent who finds them a great deal on a house. And what a house it is, one of those massive modern-art all-glass mansions up off Mulholland. On Perdition Lane. At 666. So, you think there's a portal to hell in the basement? Well, maybe, but the boys stop caring when they meet their next-door neighbor Lucy (Legend of the Seeker's Emily Foxler) and her two best friends, Delilah (The Taqwacores' Noreen DeWulf, one of Maxim's Hot 100 in 2007) and Jezebel (Unrest's Corri English). Brody figures he's in LA, it's time to throw a house party, so aside from inviting the entire city, they call their old pal Backwater (The Sarah Silverman Program's Jeff Bryan Davis), the biggest partier they know. Except Backwater is now a priest-in-training and plans to use the party to convert the faithless...

Yes, you've probably heard a lot of these jokes before, though they've been updated. And yes, the whole thing is predictable and silly. But it's also very funny; I laughed out loud as many times while watching this as I did during The Hangover, at least. The actors are in general pretty good at what they do (and there are some hilarious cameos), Englund's directorial technique has improved, not that it was all that bad, and Stoller has a good sense of comic timing backed up very well by the actors performing the material. While it's not in the same league as Return of the Living Dead, it's miles better than something like Saturday the 14th or any horror spoof directed by and/or starring a Wayans brother. If you like bad horror flicks, this is a must. *** ",1285027200,2,2958,4.735922330097087
