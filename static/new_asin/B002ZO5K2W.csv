8385198,3,B002ZO5K2W,"This silent version of Kismet is watchable.  Just keep in mind that it has had no restoration and you have to accept it as it is.  It may be the best we can ever see it.  Titles are sometimes hard to read, print damage abounds, missing frames and segments.  You can easily follow the storyline and see a more dramatic version than some of the later remakes.  My only real complaint is that on at least two of the intertitle cards during the film, the name Grapevine Video was added.  I have not seen that on other Grapevine releases, so hopefully that is not commonly done.  DVD-R.",1379894400,2,581,4.373831775700935
