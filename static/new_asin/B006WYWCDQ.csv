8505973,3,B006WYWCDQ,"This disc appears to be the same as 'Live in London' but without the song 'Superstar'. Both have misleading packaging. The performance is from 1971 and the photos on the covers are from much later. However--if you don't already have one or the other of them, I would suggest Live in London (which includes Superstar). There are not many Carpenters DVD live performances out there so at least one of them is definitely a must for fans.",1354924800,14,434,4.64935064935065
8505974,5,B006WYWCDQ,"Since I went to this show when Page/Plant where in LA @ The Great Western Forum this show has a special place in me. Show overall is good, audio is fair, but some of the Video is below Par video quality. But I would recommend it for a Fair Price.",1352505600,,246,3.94
