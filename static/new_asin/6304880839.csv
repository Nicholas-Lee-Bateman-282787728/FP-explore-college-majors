7878642,5,6304880839,"I absolutely adored this video. I purchased it several years ago, trying to get a sense of the real Ireland and found that Donleavy's  portrayal was enthralling. His knowledge and passion for his beloved Ireland came though clear and consise, his eloquent words leaving the listener grasping for more. I recommend this video to any having an interest in the emerald isle we know as Ireland. It will not disappoint!!
