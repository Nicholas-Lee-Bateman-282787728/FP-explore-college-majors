Finch's work, and this film, should appeal to artists, bikers, air brush artists,historians,metal workers and so many more. His original creations runs from exotic motorcycles to bizarre creatures. His former studio, made of green glass, Studebaker windshields, and whatever else he could find, was worthy of a film devoted strictly to it and the people who visited there over the years.
Interviews with friends, family and other bike-builders give great insight on the likeable Finch, his struggles, and the era he lived in. The interviews are well-done and often humorous, and I loved seeing where the ""Big Names"" are now. The people, the artwork, the history--it is amazing.
The ONLY reason I did not give this TEN stars was because of the much-too-long intro and the unnecessary special effects throughout, which looked very amateurish, not psychedelic 60s, and came out of nowhere (Think bad Green Screen in a movie). I almost turned the video off, worried the rest of it would also look like my own attempts at Photoshop Version One. Even the footage of Finch riding, also at the beginning, went on waaaaay too long. We were all getting uncomfortable waiting for SOMEthing to happen.
 The DVD is 91 minutes long, and could have devoted more of that space to close-ups of Finch's incredibly detailed work. My non-Finch friends did not even ""get"" the flying winged eyeballs at the start-up, and also wanted to turn off the video.  I'm glad we hung in there, and I hope others will, too. Finch, family and friends are not reality show jerks; they come across as very real, funny, talented and grateful to have lived during an interesting era.
As for Finch, he is the guy that almost everyone else copies today. FOUR Big Stars!!",1365552000,,1952,4.966360856269113

Fantastic footage and no bull accounts of the best bike builder/painter in the world. Ron Finch was a legend when I was just a teenager and in my 20's I visited his shop in Auburn Hills. My mind still goes to the cat carcass in the cage and the leg bone that moved on the wire when the door opened. The iron in progress, the BBQ cooking,and watching Ron create paint and pinstripe my bike. I watched in awe at the hands as he pinstriped. Ron isn't just a famous person to me...he was also the man that donated his metal creations to our motorcycle safety program to be auctioned off so we could buy bikes to teach others to ride. This video gives the opportunity to still see the faces of people in some of my fondest memories and the masterpieces that were created. Ron Finch - my favorite ""troll"" (he worked below the Mackinaw Bridge)and this video shows how creative visions can take you all over the world. A video for old riders, new riders, and those that appreciate art, from a master.",1360800000,2,1088,4.391089108910891
