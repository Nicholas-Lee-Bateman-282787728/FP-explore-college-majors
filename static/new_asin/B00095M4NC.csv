8607620,5,B00095M4NC,"This movie gives an excellent overview of all aspects of Muay Thai, right from the source - Thailand.  The cultural and country coverage was fascinating. There is a good mix on the background and rules of the art, along with some awesome ""live"" fight footage.  The training camp shown in the DVD seems like a great place to study the art.  I hope to train there one day.",1114214400,2,370,4.411764705882353
