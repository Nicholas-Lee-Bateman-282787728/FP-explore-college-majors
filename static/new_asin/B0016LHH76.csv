8263090,3,B0016LHH76,"I bought this set mostly because of the ""Witchcraft"" Movies.  I remember getting them as free rentals years ago but never thought they were excellent just fair B Movie fodder.  However, to my surprise they were actually better than anything found on this dvd set.  The three movies in question (Witchcraft X, Witchcraft XI, Witchcraft XII) are actually other ""C"" or ""D"" movies retitled as Witchcraft.  So in reality they only share the same Name and familiar Witchcraft symbol with the original series.  In fact only Witchcraft XI could be considered filmed well enough to be part of the series.

So what are you actually getting in this set of movies.

The best way to describe these movies to someone is that they are equal counter parts to the trash produced by Pendulum Pictures.

The effects are below amateur at best, and many times the fight scenes are weak with the sound effects out of sync.

Normally you can find large 50 - 100 movie boxsets of these films distributed by Millcreek for around $15.00.

So basically unless you find this set for less than $5.00 do not bother getting it.  I am sure Millcreek / Pendelum Pictures will have them rereleased soon enough in a much larger boxset for a better price.",1257292800,4,2246,7.370786516853933
