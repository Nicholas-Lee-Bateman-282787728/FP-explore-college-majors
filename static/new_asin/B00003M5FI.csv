1331871,5,B00003M5FI,"My son absolutely loves this dvd.  It is the only one that truly keeps his attention.  I bought it because my son is 19 months old and fascinated with animals.  The songs are catchy and he loves seeing all of the animals and the kids too.  This is the one video that my son will consistently sit down and watch.  I just got a couple of the other Baby Songs dvd's and he doesn't pay as much attention to those, but I hope that he will eventually enjoy them just as much.",1109721600,2,469,4.054347826086956

They get so excited when they hear the opening song, and they know that Baby Songs is coming on.  I would recommend this video to everyone!! I can't understand why somone wouldn't like this video, even other children that have come to my house (children that I might babysit or my neices and nephews) all love this video.  Singing old MacDonald, and seeing all the animals, B-I-N-G-O.... they love it!  Maybe I'm a goof ball, but even I love to sing along.",1048377600,7,634,4.384615384615385
1331873,5,B00003M5FI,"I don't know exactly why, but my 2 year old twin boys love this video.  It doesn't seem particularly well made, and the songs are a little on the annoying side.  But this is one of the few videos that I can count on to keep their attention while I get something done - which ranks it 5 stars in my book!",1019520000,,303,3.870967741935484
1331874,3,B00003M5FI,"I bought three video cassettes from the ""Baby Songs"" series: ""Baby Songs"", ""More Baby Songs"" and ""Baby Songs - Animals"". I did this because of the wonderful recommendations from the other reviewers. Now that I have them and I have tried several times to get my child interested in them, I have no idea what got everyone excited. The lighting/colors of the videos are not so great, the songs on other videos I have seen are much better quality, the kids themselves don't sing so you have more of a background song with something on the screen and my kid never really found these cassettes attracting. The only reason I rated the cassettes 3 stars instead of 2, is because the songs are still of good quality and there are lots of children on the cassettes. Who knows, maybe my son will start liking these cassette when he grows older (he is now 2 and loves all the other song cassettes).",1015632000,,886,4.509316770186335

1331877,5,B00003M5FI,"This is an enjoyable video for young kids.  It contains some original songs and some classics (Old McDonalds's Farm, BINGO, etc). All of the songs are done in an upbeat tempo and  they hold our two year old ` s attention.  This is one of her favorite videos.  The video portion is well done and shows both wild and domestic animals.  Many of the shots show children interacting with animals.
In addition to being fun, this video is a good way to help children identify many kinds of animals.  As different animals are shown, we like to say the name so that our daughter can start to connect the name with the animal.  Although our daughter is probably still too young to pick up on it, the tapes also  have a positive message about animals and nature.
The tape comes in a durable plastic case (no the cheap cardboard cover that some come in).  Our daughter likes to bring us tapes to show us which ones she wants to watch - and thet get dropped a lot.  The case protects the tape from getting broken.  I wish that more children's tapes were packaged like this.",970185600,16,1060,4.384615384615385
1331878,5,B00003M5FI,"When we received this video in the mail, my 3-year-old son, who loves videos, couldn't wait for me to get it out of the wrapper and into the VCR. He didn't even know what the video was, but he sure wasn't disappointed.  The first day we received this video, we watched it twice. And we only  watched it twice because we ran out of time! The following day he took the  video with him to the babysitters house and he, along with 5 other  children, ages ranging from 14 months to 6 years, all loved this video.  They danced and sang and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It is a perfect  children's video, made just for children. A wonderful addition to any  child's video collection.",950659200,34,678,4.463414634146342

1331956,5,B00003M5FI,"Ok, to begin with I had no idea who Hap was.  I just knew that I didn't want my triplets hooked on broadcast TV stuff that was full of marketing, commercials, etc. So we ordered BabyFirstTV (kinda like HBO for babies) and during the programming they would show these videos.  It didn't take long for me to notice that my kids were MESMERIZED by Palmer's music videos.  I quickly recognized the prints and hairstyles from my own childhood (80's kid) and went on a search until I found the DVD's here.  The kids LOVED them and now that they are almost two they actually ask for them by name.  I would HIGHLY recommend these DVD's to anyone who is interested in exposing their children to music, rhyming, social skills, development skills, sillyness and laughter via your DVD player.  I am not saying they take the place of actual experiences but they sure do enhance them.  You don't know how handy it is to get your triplet toddlers to quickly cooperate and follow instructions by just singing a simple song to them. Anyway, long story short....  WE LOVE HAP PALMER AND THESE DVDs!",1180742400,2,1080,4.588541666666667

She loves all the animals & the music too, she'll dance around to it or pull her chair close to the tv & sit staring at it intently.  Hap Palmer's recipe for entertainment has definately worked for my kids.  I appreciate the simplicity of the arrangements...simple props and ordinary kids (no actors) are choreographed into the videos.  Great, quality entertainment!  A+++ series...highly recommend them all.",1168819200,,582,5.010416666666667
1331979,5,B00003M5FI,"We love baby songs at our house. I have a three year old and a one year old and Hap Palmer's songs never fail to put a smile on their faces. I was first introduced to Baby Songs as a teenage babysitter in the early 90's. The toddler for which I babysat had 2 Baby Songs videos which he loved to watch. I found that songs like Today I Took My Diapers Off and Sitting In My Highchair would be running through my head for days. Years later, after having a child of my own, I was delighted to discover that many of those same catchy tunes that I remembered from my babysitting days had been compiled in DVD format. We started by renting at the library and then purchased our own copies of Original Baby Songs, Baby's Busy Day, Baby Songs ABC, as well as this Baby Songs Animals video. I prefer Original Baby Songs and Baby's Busy Day to the other two we own, but in all fairness, my kids seem to adore all four equally. Yes, the songs are a bit corny and the hairstyles and clothes are a bit outdated (which I find endearing in a nostalgic sort of way), but your baby, toddler, or pre-schooler is sure to adore it. Isn't that what really matters? Be aware that this video contains only 9 songs, excluding the Baby Songs theme, which runs at the beginning and end of each Baby Songs DVD. This is roughly half the number of songs on the other Baby Songs DVDs we own. Our copy has been mislabled as having a running time of 45 min. I timed from the start of the Baby Songs theme to the end credits and it was actually only 25 minutes long. I don't mind this since I think this is a very appropriate length for a DVD designed for the pre-school set, but you definitely get less Baby Songs for your buck with this one. The songs are all very Baby Songsish, sweet and corny, wholesome and fun. Our personal favorite is ""Amazing"". Each verse of this song names a bunch of different animals and flashes a picture of each animal as it is named. My kids looooove the real animal footage and I do too since it is something like a trip to the zoo minus the slimy sunscreen and overpriced snacks. My only criticism of this song is that when they name chickadee they flash a picture of a fuzzy, yellow chick, when in reality a chickadee is a bird that looks more like a fat sparrow than a baby chicken. Still, we can't get enough Baby Songs and I would buy this DVD again in a heartbeat.",1147824000,10,2369,4.197368421052632
1331980,3,B00003M5FI,"Positives -

Happy & friendly, none of the harsh sarcasm seen on many kids cartoons nowdays.

Soothing on the nerves of a baby and mommy sick of Barney and puppet shows!

Nice background for keeping playtime mellow or white noise for napping in a busy house.

Negatives -

Video isn't very interesting, very generic. My son adores animals but he snored through this.

Songs are VERY VERY long and complex for baby songs. Itsy Bitsy Spider congradulations, your epic adventure has been imortalized with this new ballad of your saga! Good luck learning them all I get the warm fuzzies being right occasionally while singing this with my baby, but we aren't exactly video freaks.
