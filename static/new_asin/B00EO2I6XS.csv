But in both cases, the flaws have nothing to do with Sukowa, whom I had never heard of before Vision but who I now see is one of the world's greatest actors. She is perfect in both roles, in both movies. Since she dominates both movies, she is so good that she earns the movies five stars from me despite the serious flaws.

The flaw in this movie is that many of the supporting roles are filled by terrible actors, and they're so bad that they can't be ignored - when they're on screen they completely derail the movie, and it doesn't recover until Sukowa returns and they leave. The very worst of those incompetent performances are by actors (Megan Gay, Harvey Friedman and Janet McTeer) who have been thoroughly competent in other movies, so the problem must be with von Trotta's direction of them.

The fact that all three characters are Americans (only one of the actors - Friedman - is) probably isn't a coincidence. Von Trotta evidently doesn't have much sense of how Americans tick, or even talk, so she doesn't quite know how to create credible American characters in a movie. Germans - of any era - she does great; Americans: no.

A secondary but related flaw is that she should have hired an American production designer. I understand why she filmed all the New York interior scenes (which means practically the whole movie) in Germany, but, unfortunately, they all LOOK like German interiors, not at all like real New York interiors, even in the early 1960s.

Although I'm very glad she made this movie, if she plans to continue filming American stories she really needs to get help from people who know how to create a believable America and believable Americans on film. She's a great director, but she needs help if she intends to keep making movies about America.",1385424000,2,2040,5.0625

5929423,5,B00EO2I6XS,"I saw the film's U.S. debut at the Santa Barbara Film Festival last year.  It's a masterpiece.  Sorry to disappoint the critics, but like 90% of the audience you didn't understand it.  True , Hannah in the flick - a bit sexier than in real life - I lived in the Village at the time. And Mary McCarthy - a lot less - in life, she used her astounding beauty to intimidate men. But if you want to find out what Philosophy is about - see this film.  Having taught the subject for a decade and a half, that's my opinion anyway.  The film also explains the concept of ""the banality of evil"" - on which perceived truth Ms. Arendt staked her career - as well any document short of Eichmann In Jerusalem itself.",1382918400,10,702,4.208955223880597
5929424,5,B00EO2I6XS,"If you are not interested in philosophy or in grand questions such as, how can humans commit almost unimaginable acts of inhumanity? then you should not bother with this film. You very well might be, as one reviewer wrote, ""bored to death.""  But if questions of this magnitude interest you, then there might not be another author who explores them with more intensity of focus than Hannah Arendt. This film merely skims the surface of her exceedingly complex and often misunderstood philosophical interpretation of Eichmann's crimes. The subject of this film is the social controversy surrounding her initial publications of her theory about Eichmann and the Holocaust. However, the ambition of the film must also be to bring attention to Arendt, one of the most talented philosophers of the twentieth century, and who, like most women of genius, is usually given short shrift in favor of less talented male counterparts. The acting is so perfect that I remained haunted by the characters. There are many other strengths as well: the script, beautifully folding in Arendt's relationships, including her friendship with Mary McCarthy; the sets of her apartment and classroom; the footage of Eichmann. But I think one of the final touches of insight was to have no real ending to the film thereby reminding the audience that the inquiry into the large questions tackled by Arendt will always remain open and unfinished.",1382140800,68,1417,5.107758620689655
5929425,1,B00EO2I6XS,"No genre of films has so consistently misrepresented famous women, but this one sinks to new lows. The director has utterly failed to capture anything of the uniqueness of Hannah Arendt as a philosopher,mor her complexity as someone who courted Heidegger, and so had her own ghost in the closet, yet had the courage to argue the unspeakable truth, that Eichmann was bot a monster or psychopath, but an utterly ordinary burocrat. The truth of that statement still has to sink in. But anyway, the dialogue in the movie is too stereotypical and you will not gain any new insights into the woman,mor the philosopher.

5929426,4,B00EO2I6XS,"As a former student of Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, whose expertise regards the Holocaust, the theological implications of the Holocaust, and decades of studying mass murder and genocide, this film was a must see for me.

Fortunately, All Saints Cinema in Tallahassee, Florida, our independent films site, showed the film last weekend and will be again this upcoming weekend (today being Wednesday, September 25th).

The film provided me with a deeper knowledge of Hannah Arendt, the trial, and the aftermath for her professional reputation.  Substantial raw footage of the trial was a critical aspect of the film.

Her books include ""The Origins of Totalitarianism"" (1951). Revised ed.; New York: Schocken, 2004. (Includes all the prefaces and additions from the 1958, 1968, and 1972 editions.); ""The Human Condition"" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958); ""On Revolution"" (New York: Viking, 1963); ""Men in Dark Times"" (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1968); ""On Violence"" Harvest Books (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1970). (Also included in Crises of the Republic.); ""Life of the Mind"", unfinished at her death, Ed. Mary McCarthy, 2 vols. (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978). ISBN 0-15-107887-4; ""Love and Saint Augustine"". [her dissertation] Edited with an Interpretive Essay by Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott and Judith Chelius Scott (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1996/1998).

""In her reporting of the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for ""The New Yorker"", which evolved into ""Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil"" (1963), she coined the phrase ""the banality of evil"" to describe Eichmann. She raised the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions and inaction. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel. She also was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably M. C. Rumkowski, acted during the Holocaust. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Shoah, also known as the Holocaust.

""Due to this lingering criticism, her book has only recently been translated into Hebrew. Arendt ended the book by writing:

  'Just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations -- as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world -- we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.' ""

Thank you to Wikipedia.  And I refer the reader to begin learning more about Hannah Arendt through Wikipedia and the rest of the Internet.  As well as, of course, the film; her books and articles; and those about her.",1380067200,33,3215,5.056710775047259
5929427,4,B00EO2I6XS,"Early while watching this film, a scene came to mind from the novel ""The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H."" by George Steiner. An aged German judge, in the S.S. during his youth, listens to his daughter and her friends, in the next room, playing the piano. Their playing is technically accomplished but too safe; they're afraid, in music as elsewhere, to cross boundaries of convention, to dare the unexpected, the rash, the exceptional. Therefore their music is mediocre. He doesn't blame them. After all, his generation had dared, made a fetish of, stepping over boundaries, crossing lines, boldly going into the unprecedented. No. Better play safe. Be nice, good, unassuming Germans.

For a German director, presumably non-Jewish, and her friends to make a film about Hannah Arendt, Adolf Eichmann and his trial in Israel, questions about the Holocaust and evil, and the reactions of New York intellectuals, mostly Jewish, was an audacious start. But everything after that seems to have been very concerned with playing it safe, polite, to avoid any potential for serious offense from the likely audience, to please the people one would afterward meet at dinners, parties.

What would make for a more daring film? Into mind drifted a near-riot I witnessed years ago over the Italian film ""Immacolata and Concetta"". Some of those storming out, very very upset, threatened to tear down the theater. Some had pieces of the theater in their hands. What bothered them so? Most said they had a expected a pleasant soft-core lesbian romance -- but instead felt subjected to abuse, torture. It was torture of sorts. That film adeptly used conventions of cinema realism, psychological manipulation, to lure us, the audience, into that relaxed state of pleasant surrender we usually want, over and over and again. But just when it had us there, so soft and pliant, that film, again and again, abruptly, by visual and auditory means, applied shock, psychological cruelty, to viscerally alienate us, as audience, out of passive compliance, and attempting, in a manner likely inspired by Artaud and Brecht, to move us away from that warm oceanic passivity toward sharp thought especially about our own psychological habits, our routine patterns of response, of seeking escape from the world of harsh power-relations into private utopias. To instead no longer at ease confront, examine delusions and truths.

But this film, this ""Hannah Arendt"", doesn't dare. Staying safely within banal conventions of cinematic documentary realism, it doesn't try much to make visible the invisible surreal irreal life of the mind, as more daring directors have. But this avoidance is fascinating. Interest in, movement toward the proclaimed overt issues, themes, seems only simulated, a head fake. Instead there's much more attention, care for female faces and bodies, clothed and elegant, not lascivious, but as if searching there for something else entirely, somewhere between physical desire and abstraction on the way up Diotima's ladder toward the opposite of evil and banality. But this remains too much an undercurrent hidden under a too-circumspect, too polite, too determined to be conventional, surface. Sticks and stones and Nazi thugs may hurt our bones. But words and mere shadows on a screen? There, we can and should dare.",1379203200,,3311,5.208255159474672
5929428,4,B00EO2I6XS,"Making a film about a philosopher presents challenges. Philosophers and the life of reflection are internalized and often require patience and discipline to understand. Movies for a wide audience tend to depend on action. Directed by Margarethe von Trotta and starring Barbara Sukowa in the title role, ""Hannah Arendt"" has the famous German-Jewish migr philosopher as its subject. If understandably slow in places, ""Hannah Arendt"" is worthwhile. The movie played in an independent theater in Washington, D.C. to appreciative audiences. It is valuable that it will soon available and accessible on DVD, and that the film is now available for review and discussion here on Amazon. The movie is in part in English and in part in German, with subtitles.

Hannah Arendt (1906 -- 1975) studied philosophy in Germany and wrote her dissertation (on St. Augustine)  under Karl Jaspers. She became an American citizen in 1950, and taught and wrote widely.  In 1961, Arendt covered the trial of Adolph Eichmann in Jerusalem and wrote what became her most famous book, ""Eichmann in Jerusalem""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eichmann-in-Jerusalem-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039881/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eichmann in Jerusalem (Penguin Classics)</a>&nbsp;which was and remains highly controversial. The book became known for the term ""banality of evil"" which Arendt seemed to use to characterize Eichmann's activities.

The movie ""Hannah Arendt"" focuses upon Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trial and the controversy her book engendered. Much of the book is set in the rarefied world of the New York City intellectual as Arendt is shown with her dear friend Mary McCarthy (Janet McTeer), her beloved but philandering husband Heinrich (Axel Milberg), and others. There are scenes of Arendt teaching her classes and less effective scenes of the philosopher alone with herself thinking and writing.

Then there are scenes of Eichmann and the trial using original footage. I found these scenes effective. Arendt observes and ponders, less facts than theory and motivation. She studied the trial transcript but did not observe the trial in its entirety.

The movie tries to capture something of Arendt's thoughts, at the inevitable price of over-simplification. It captures well the furor resulting from the book, with some readers thinking that Arendt trivialized Eichmann and perhaps even the Holocaust.  The movie includes a ringing scene in which Arendt defends her book before a skeptical university audience.

Flashbacks show Arendt's affair as a young impressionable college student with the famous philosopher Martin Heidegger, married and many years older than Arendt.  Many years after she became famous herself, Arendt got back in touch with the aged Heidegger and visited him and his wife.

Arendt's claim about the banality of evil emphasizes the ease with which people can be ensnared. Many today would argue that Arendt said something difficult and important about the ""banality of evil"" while she misjudged radically the character and deep personal culpability of Eichmann.

""Hanna Arendt"" is thoughtful and captures its time and characters, including the chain-smoking philosopher, but it plods at times. It remains a good rare attempt to think about philosophy through film.

5929429,4,B00EO2I6XS,"""Hannah Arendt"" (2012 release from Germany; 109 min.) is NOT a biopic of the German ""political theorist"" Hannah Arendt. Instead, it brings us the story surrounding Hannah Arendt (played by Barbara Sukowa) in 1961 when she is hired by the New Yorker Magazine to cover the trial in Jerusalem of ex-Nazi Adolf Eichmann, who was famously abducted by the Israeli secret police in Buenos Aires to stand trial for his crimes/atrocities against the Jews. Arendt soon creates a controversy within her circle of friends, and later, when her articles are published, within the Jewish community at large, with her controversial, yet misunderstood, views on the trial. It was in those articles that Arendt coined the now famous term ""the banality of evil"".

Several comments: this is another historical drama, say along the lines of the recent ""Emperor"" movie. But there are differences. First, there is the amazing performance of Barbara Sukowa in the title role. She is simply outstanding. Second, this is directed by the legendary German director Margarethe von Trotta, now in her 70s if you can believe is. (Sukowa and von Trotta have teamed up before.) Third, the movie makes ample use of historical footage of the actual trial of Eichmann, and it is fascinating stuff to watch. Fourth, while there are a number of flashbacks to Arendt's earlier days as a philosophy student and her involvement with professor/philosopher Martin Heidegger (who eventually joined the Nazi party), there remain much more to be said/shown about Arendt (which of course is not the scope of this movie). Fifth, this being set in 1961, people are smoking cigarettes non-stop in virtually every scene of the movie, it is just beyond belief. Lastly, a weakness in the movie is that there is no enough real drama to be felt, even with all the controversies going on, reason that I rate this ""only"" 4 stars, as I still enjoyed the movie quite a bit.

I saw ""Hannah Arendt"" a few weekends ago at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and the matinee screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, tilting heavily towards seniors. Alas, the movie didn't play very long on the big screen (it's already gone). That said, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, or simply interested in the historical context of this topic, I would readily recommend you seek this out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.",1376956800,48,2390,4.8697788697788695

5929433,3,B00EO2I6XS,"I admit that I was very disappointed with the 113 minute 2013 film about the unusual very controversial ideas of Hannah Arendt about Adolf Eichmann and the 1961 trial that found him guilty of his involvement in the mass murder of some six million Jews and others. Hannah Arendts reaction was The Banality of Evil, the idea that something simple causes evil. It seems to me that this is a simplistic idea.
I was in Israel in an Israeli bus in 1960 when an announcement was made over the bus loud speaker that Adolf Eichmann was captured by Israelis and was brought to Israel to stand trial. I saw the reactions of the Israelis, the tears, the cheers, and their quiet moments when the passengers recalled slain love ones. Hannah Arendt ignored the tragedy and focused instead on her unusual idea.
Hannah Arendt ((1906-1975) was a Jewish German political theorist, a title she gave herself who was able to escape being killed in Germany, and settled in the US and taught in various colleges. She was a disciple and apparently the long-time lover of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) who was a controversial figure because of his affiliation with Nazism. This relationship is acknowledged in the film, but the film has many scenes where she and her husband are expressing love of each other  with statements such as, how can you leave the house without a kiss  apparently to cover-over the Arendt-Heidegger affair. Although people, especially Jews, described her as a Jew-hater after she wrote her book about the banality of evil, where, among other things, she wrote that Jewish leaders were guilty of cooperating with the Nazis, there is no proof that she shared the Nazi beliefs.
She was hired by the New Yorker magazine to cover the story of the trial. The New Yorker issued several articles by her about the trial and she later published a book on the subject. While there were people who praised the book, most people felt her ideas were disturbing and wrong.
I disliked the film about these events for primarily two reasons. First and foremost, I think the film failed to fully explain her views. Second, I think the film spent too much time showing she had many friends before the book was published and lost a lot of them after its publication. I think this over-emphasis was an unnecessary attempt to make us identify with her and feel sorry for her. More of the 113 minutes of the film could have been better used to help us understand her views.
I think that Hannah Arendt trivialized the views of most people. She argued that Eichmanns problem was that he did not think. Eichmann repeated frequently that he was only doing what he was told by the government to do. Had he thought about the evil that was being done, that he was involved in the murder of millions, he would have, according to Arendt, abandoned what he was doing. In essence, she wrote, evil is not satanic, it is bureaucratic, it is the failure to think about what one is doing. I have the impression that Eichmanns claim of innocence was untrue and an invention of some lawyer in an attempt to save him from being executed; and I think Hannah Arendt accepted his claim as being true.
It seems to me that Arendt overly focused on her idea that evil occurs because of the failure to think and failed to realize that while it is true that the failure to think and realize the consequences of our acts is one cause of evil, most of the evil that is caused by others is satanic, to use her word. There are people who are evil and have ideas and do things that others consider wrong, such as the sociopath who kills cats and dogs simply because it gives him pleasure. One cannot say Hitler did what he did because he did not think about the outcome.
I do not understand why Hannah Arendt stressed the one point and not the other. In fact, had she spoken about the various causes of evil, I do not think her ideas would have been controversial.
One further word. Arendt has not convinced me that Eichmann was simply a bureaucrat. When his bosses told him to stop sending Jews to the concentration camps to be killed, he continued to send them, and he did other acts which show that, contrary to Arendt, he did think, he knew what he was doing, that he was sending people to their death.",1490227200,2,4273,4.577023498694517
5929434,5,B00EO2I6XS,"Hannah Arendt book on Eichmann is one of the most famous books on this trial and is frequently quoted.

The story is good, and it is the story of her life mainly centering on her book on Eichmann, but her earlier and later history is also addressed. The  . The main emphasis in this movie is how much did the Jewish Councils under NAZI rule help in the extermination of the Jewish people? I have read several books upon this subject, and the answer which I think that most modern scholarship would agree is that in this, is they were minor. The NAZIs killed with and without them. That, however, is an answer in 2017, when  Eichmann  was being tried people were still debating this question, and it was a major argument then. The other question the film asks is what was Eichmann, a small official or a symbol of something much more.

The film itself is skilfully acted. I thought that  Barbara Sukowa played very ably. For someone in 2017, it was weird to see so much smoking but that is what it was then.

5929442,3,B00EO2I6XS,"Hannah Arendt, directed and co-written by Margarethe von Trotta, casts an eye on the controversy that erupted, when famed political theorist Hannah Arendt, a victim of Nazi persecution herself before she emigrated to the United States, wrote about the banality of evil in The New Yorker in 1963, in her series of articles covering the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann in Jerusalem. This was followed by a lot of hate mail and spirited public as well as academic debate on, not only the origins of evil, but the allegations of the complicity of Jewish leadership in the fate that met many European Jews under Nazi power. The film begins as the trial begins, in 1961, when Hannah Arendt (Barbara Sukowa) lived in New York with husband Heinrich Blucher (Axel Milberg) and lectured at the New School for Social Research. She asks for and receives an assignment to cover Eichmanns trial for The New Yorker, with great expectations from editor William Shawn (Nicholas Woodeson).

The expatriate community of German intellectuals in New York included Arendts old friend and rival Hans Jonas (Ulrich Noethen), who studied under Martin Heidegger, before the philosopher aligned himself with National Socialism, just as Arendt had. Arendts affair with Heidegger is legendary, but it is marginalized here, in favor of Heideggers influence on the role that thinking and thinking about thinking- plays in how Arendt interprets events. Though Im sure Margarethe von Trotta intended the ideas she presents in the film to be universal, the arguments over the legality and morality of Eichmanns trial among those German expatriates in New York seem like something that was immensely important to Germans in a certain time and place but of little interest to anyone else. Eichmann, of course, portrayed himself as a small part of a vast bureaucracy who was just following orders. Arendt concludes that he was a small man who was simply unable to think.

Her position placed her between people who wanted to see Eichmann as evil incarnate, a different species from themselves, and those, like her husband, who thought the whole thing an illegal farce. Her assertion that Jewish leadership had often been complicit in Nazi persecution, based on what she heard at the trial, made a lot of people angry. The climax of the film is a powerful speech in which she defends her concept of the banality of evil but brushes off questions about Jewish leadership. Its difficult to make a film about real people debating political philosophy. Its a topic more suited to metaphor. I like Barbara Sukowa in this role a lot; she radiates warmth and great force of personality as Hannah Arendt. But, ultimately, this is an extended vignette of Arendt. We never really understand her. The ideas are problematic, because 50 years later, the argument would be different. We now know more about Eichmann and about collaboration and reluctant cooperation.

Though we are more capable of testing the facts than was possible in 1963, the arguments in the film cannot be resolved. Hannah Arendt insisted on the accuracy of her observations in order to defend her ideas from attack. Consciously or unconsciously, she was never writing about Eichmann the person except in biographical details- but about the ideas that his defense unleashed in her mind, based on what was there already. It doesnt matter if Eichmann was as she described. Similarly, those who offered emotionalist rebuttals and accused Arendt of being all arrogance and no feeling were defending the world order that they believed in for reasons other than what they said. These parties talked past one another, because their arguments were awkward stand-ins for something else. It doesnt accomplish anything to put this in a film, unless the film is about the context that created the two (or more) sides to the debate. We get no context here just the arguments and a good cast.

You need to know quite a bit about Hannah Arendt to make any sense of it and even if you do, you'll still be confused. Firstly, who are all these people who keep popping up? We're never introduced to them properly and never learn what importance they held for her. That is, except for her husband, who keeps kissing and fondling her.  Very romantic, I'm sure, but it doesn't help untangle the awful plot. The acting is uniformly poor and the Arendt character spends far too much of the movie lighting cigarettes, giving off unconvincing laughs and staring intently at the screen as Eichmann testifies. The only reason l give this two stars rather than one is that some of the archive material from the trial is gripping and her final speech to her students, explaining why she had written her famous article about the trial, is well done.

5929459,5,B00EO2I6XS,"I have read many books about the Holocaust and its aftermath. I have seen many films and documentaries on that subject. Few have attempted to examine or explain the mentality of the people who were responsible for it and willingly participated in those crimes.
They have been usually branded as ""monsters,"" and there is an end to it.
While there have been, and still are, too many monsters loose in the world, too often human beings reply upon that label to abstain from thinking about it. Crimes there are, and have been. Trials might occur; justice meted out and sentences passed.
Can a correct verdict be given, but for all of the wrong reasons?
Can a person behave monstrously and participate in monstrous actions, yet not be a monster?
The film ""Hannah Arendt"" attempts to answer these questions, to substitute a dispassionate evaluation of facts against hysteria and mob mentality.
German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt ( herself an early victim of the Nazi regime ) chooses to report on the Eichmann trial for ""The New Yorker"" magazine.
Arendt is fearful that the trial will be nothing more than a ""show trial,"" with a predetermined verdict based on passion rather than the facts: witnesses brought forth who survived the Holocaust, but with no personal connection to Eichmann whatsoever.
While convinced that Eichmann deserved the death sentence, Arendt believes that he was convicted for the wrong reasons.
Her articles about the trial in ""The New Yorker"" and the subsequent book provoked an uproar in the Jewish community because she also apportioned blame to the Nazi-organized Councils of Jewish Elders for their share in the Final Solution.
She refuses to accede to their demands that she recant her magazine articles and abandon the upcoming book.
Arendt ultimately saw Eichmann as a human being, a ""little man"" who behaved monstrously, referring to this concept as the ""banality of evil.""
In laymen's terms, ""I was just doing my job.""
We hear that phrase used every day.
This film is a brilliant portrayal of a victim of the Nazi regime attempting to balance her own experiences and inner demons with the need to be indifferent to all but the facts of the case. A call for reason in the face of passion.
That is something that should be taken into account after the recent tragedies in Ferguson, Missouri and the ensuing national uproar it produced.

5929465,4,B00EO2I6XS,"I first saw this film in 2013 in New York City at the Quad Cinema shortly after its release and I liked it.  I've now viewed it for a second time & found it to be equally absorbing.  Before seeing this movie I'd only heard of Hannah Arendt -- via Camille Paglia -- Thus I wanted to find out more about her (I haven't read any of Arendt's books).  I was enamored as much with the ideas discussed / questioned raised within this film -- As I was with the accompanying performances, cinematography, interiors ETC.  Whether or not Arendt was ultimately correct in her assessment of Adolf Eichmann's character -- Still doesn't invalidate her concept of ""the banality of evil"" which has ongoing relevance for the state of the human condition.

Previously I'd only been familiar with lead actress Barbara Sukowa (Hannah Arendt) -- Having seen her as ""Mieze"" in R. W. Fassbinder's ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" (1980).  In that German TV film, comparatively speaking, she was an ingenue -- Playing a character that is the complete opposite of Hannah Arendt.  Sukowa as Hannah may have been cast against type; nonetheless, she does an excellent job with tho role.  Also noteworthy is Janet McTeer's portrayal of Arendt's friend and staunch defender, author Mary McCarthy.  I do plan on watching the film again and hopefully / eventually reading Arendt's book ""The Origins of Totalitarianism"".

5929469,4,B00EO2I6XS,"There will always be a problem capturing a philosopher through film. This appears to capture the person well but does not clarify the bones at the centre of her book ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"". Put aside the over used 'banality of evil"". This does not appear to be the gist of what she was saying regarding Eichmann but more the human condition which enables many to do harm through a process of dehumanising 'the other'. The role of decent society; the acceptance of the majority of such a society to accept crimes against humanity under totalitarian rule. She notes the Eichmann trial was an opportunity lost for moral debate and the conclusion from the film, is that she blamed the victims of the Holocaust for their passivity and some Jewish leaders for their collusion with the Nazi and German operators of the machinery of mass murder. The book is different, it is more philosophy than reportage and the philosophy of morality, ethics and individual responsibility, culpability and actions. it makes for uncomfortable, but thought provoking and absorbing reading. The film does not adequately capture this and so never appears to be at grips with its subject matter-philosophy through the lens of reportage. But as a portrait of a complex woman and thinker-it works. It encouraged me to go back and read ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" and see it is not as contentious as it would have appeared in the 1960s. If there is a flaw in Ms Arendt's construct it is how remorselessly degrading people to being worthless would reduce the greater majority of us to a state of helplessness. And it is not morally difficult for others to take advantage of this and build a construct that justifies them doing so. The enormity of this construct in Nazi Germany and the accompanying lack of remorse or responsibility of the majority of the generation who were part of this and the indifference of the world to pursue justice on behalf of those murdered still resonates in her book but is clinical and dispassionate. I prefer to read the personalised stories from this time as they remind me each life lost had a story, connections, a potential future which was ripped away. And there were so many who to this day have left no trace of their history. For them it is worth remembering and continuing to bear witness to the right of their existence which was torn away by the legitimised, state and society sanctioned business of murder.",1411862400,2,2416,4.810096153846154
5929470,3,B00EO2I6XS,"Other reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of Margarethe von Trotta's portrayal of Hannah Arendt (Barbara Sukowa) and her opinion of the Jewish leaders as expressed in her NEW YORKER articles on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961.

As a piece of film-making, however, HANNAH ARENDT grabs the attention and does not let go throughout its 113-minute running-time.  As portrayed by Sukowa, Arendt comes across as a forthright person, not frightened of expressing her opinions and responding to any intellectual challenges from close friends such as Kurt Blumenfeld (Michael Degen).  Yet beneath that tough surface lurks a profoundly disillusioned person, as she discovers to her cost that her great teacher and mentor Martin Heidegger (Klaus Pohl) does not practice what he preaches.  Although insistent on reinforcing the distinction between ""reason"" and ""passion,"" Heidegger takes the ""passionate"" decision to associate himself with the Nazi party, and thereby embraces their totalitarian values.  Like Eichmnann himself, he chooses not to ""think"" but to commit himself to an ideology that actively discourages individual thought.

The sense of shock and disillusion Arendt experiences inevitably colors her view of the Eichmann trial.  Director von Trotta includes several close-ups of her sitting in the press-room listening to the testimony of Eichmann, his accusers and the witnesses, a quizzical expression on her face, as if she cannot quite make sense of what she hears.  She cannot condemn Eichmann, because he has simply followed Heidegger's course of action.

Once the articles have been published, Arendt experiences an almost unprecedented campaign of vilification.  Although she is given a climactic scene where she defends herself in front of her students (and her accusers within the university faculty), we get the sense that she is only doing so on the basis of abstractions; her personal feelings are somehow disengaged.  She is far more affected when her one-time close friend Hans Jonas (Ulrich Noethen) vows never to talk to her again on account of her views.  Philosophers might be able to make sense of the world, but they often neglect human relations.

Consequently our view of Arendt, as portrayed in this film, is profoundly ambivalent.  While empathizing with her views about the banality of evil, which reduces people to automata as they claim they were only carrying out orders, even while being involved in atrocities, Arendt herself comes across as rather myopic, so preoccupied with her ideas that she has little or no clue about how they might affect those closest to her.  It's a wonder, therefore, that Mary McCarthy (Janet McTeer) chooses to stick with her through the worst of circumstances.

Ingeniously combining archive footage of the Eichmann trial with color re-enactments of what happened during that period, HANNAH ARENDT is a thought-provoking piece, even if we find it difficult to identify with the central character.",1410393600,5,2978,5.372043010752688

Add to this the number of times we see the actress walking, smoking, sitting smoking, talking smoking, lying down smoking, well, just smoking, smoking, smoking - oh my God, how dull and irritating..  The whole thing is an ad for Philip Morris and RJR.

The most interesting thing for me would have been the relationship between her and Heidegger.  But, alas, no such luck, just walks and smoking there, hugs.  What did that Nazi do to the Jew?  We are not told.

I guess it is a foreign film, much of it is in subtitles, which, for me, just make the whole thing more tedious and alienating.

That most evil is done by banal people just doing their job to me is a no brainer.  Take a look around: spy programs in your computer, in your games, in your browser, in your chat rooms, in your phone in your Angry Birds app, nude photographs of almost all airport passengers are held by the government just waiting for the time to use them against you, and being laughed at by those just doing their job.  We have engaged in torture and called it ""enhanced interrogation"" with almost all news outlets following suit.  We have a president who gives trillions to bankers who launder Mexican cartel drug money, break sanctions to Iran, defraud millions of home owners and retirement accouts and do not go to jail.  Instead their bonuses ensured by the President at the same time he lies to us and says he is blocking them.  He has now killed American, including children, overseas without established due process, a court, a judge or a jury.  And most of us sit silent.

Then there is the horror that is Israel: that society seems to have lost it's moral basis, seems to have established ghettos for Palestenians, an Apartheid, and reacts to stone throwing with bullets through the heart or heard, taking more land, taking more land, taking more land, all this with billions of US aid!  Our tax dollars being used to deprive Palestenians of their homes - all bureaucratically done.  Think of the wonderful cuts, and counterpoint that could have been done.

Hanna Arendt had some courage by pointing out horrendous crimes are done by little people.  This film is not.

However, I believe that one of her points was precisely that monsters can be banal, inflicting unspeakable suffering and putting people to death just as if they were shuffling papers or handing in some bureaucratic report. And indeed psychopaths (which is what I consider Eichmann to be) are banal: they walk around acting just like ""normal people"" (Dahmer, Bianchi, Rumsfeld, Bush, Cheny, BTK, to name a few), fitting into their families, churches and work place with no problems. They have the capacity of completely dehumanizing their victims, which is what makes them monsters in my mind. But I see no contradiction in calling monsters banal: in a sense, the human capacity  to inflict unspeakable atrocities on other human beings is the most commonplace, predictable behavior of all. I just wish that this film had delved a little bit more into that issue and less into Arendt's affectionate relationship with her husband and her smoking...",1393113600,4,1433,5.067796610169491

5929496,5,B00EO2I6XS,"I read The Origins of Totalitarianism as an undergraduate in the early 60s. On the one hand I was blown away by the sheer brilliance of Arendt's mind; on the other I often felt a tendency to become so enamored of an idea that it blinded her to counterexamples, caveats and ""yes but"" nuances. Most importantly, however, she did her own thinking. She never kowtowed to conventional opinion or fellow-travelled with the majority.

A number of years after Arendt's death some small-minded dogmatist invented the concept of ""political correctness"", the notion that all ideas have to pass through a sieve of acceptability, defined by the prevailing ideological current of whatever in-group is in charge, before they are eligible to be debated. Arendt would have recognized the fundamental totalitarianism of this pernicious concept.

This film, as brilliant as its protagonist, deals with that period of her intellectual life in which she became a victim of PC. Her ideas were attacked not for their content but for their consequences. Her criticism of the Judenr&auml;te was interpreted as blaming the victim; pointing out Eichmann's mediocrity was seen as an excuse. Von Trotta's sympathies clearly lie with Arendt, but she lets the opponents speak. The controversy is presented in a span of minutes as well as a debate can be that lasted for years, with the emphasis on the personal price Arendt paid for her intellectual courage.

The virulence has passed, to some extent. Eichmann in Jerusalem was finally published in Israel, some forty years too late. The role of the Judenr&auml;te continues to be debated and I think it is fair to say that Arendt's treatment of a complex question lacks nuance.

Ironically, we now know that her assessment of Eichmann the man was wrong. Documents that came to light only after Arendt's death make clear that he was not the faceless bureaucrat he pretended to be while in the glass box. He did not merely follow orders, he issued them. He was not devoid of thought, rather he was a committed Nazi who after the war was active in efforts to reestablish the regime. He was as great a criminal as any of those condemned at Nuremberg.

None of this invalidates the notion of the ""banality of evil"", which still seems necessary to explain why thousands of Germans and other collaborators calmly carried out the orders of Eichmann and his fellow monsters. Well, no, not to explain it: it is beyond explanation. But no attempt at comprehending the incomprehensible is complete without Arendt and her fearless attempt to look evil in the eye.

Capturing that courage through the performance of Barbara Sukowa is only one of this film's virtues. It also portrays that enclave of German emigr&eacute;s that made such an impact on the intellectual life of the day that it was called ""The Fourth Reich""--ironically, of course, as it was composed mainly of Jews, social democrats and Communists, all of whom would have been Hitler's victims had they not fled in time. (For this reason, the film is best appreciated with the original soundtrack, a mixture of English and German as it prevailed in that circle--though Sukowa's English is less accented than Arendt's was, nor, incredibly, does she smoke as much.)

This is a film about ideas and their consequences, some of which are deeply, even tragically, personal. That's a difficult thing to pull off but Margarethe von Trotta has done it.",1391472000,3,3414,4.968476357267951

This is not exactly a biographical movie. Directed by Margarethe von Trotta (Rosa Luxemburg), Hannah Arendt covers an important episode in Arendt's life, her writing of the article about Eichmanns trial (commissioned by the New Yorker magazine) and its consequences. In flashbacks the film also deals with Arendts relationships with her mentor Martin Heidegger (Klaus Pohl) when she was in Germany.

In Hannah Arendt the philosopher is depicted as a very interesting person, someone complex as her different interactions with her supportive husband Heinrich Blcher (Axel Milberg) and outspoken friend and novelist Mary McCarthy (Janet McTeer) show.

This is not to say the film gives us an insightful look at what made her what she was, or the controversy her writing had caused, but thanks to the strong performance of Barbara Sukowa as Hannah Arendt, the film presents a credible portrayal of a determined philosopher who keeps thinking.",1389052800,,1170,5.115183246073299

I happen to believe murderous gangsters took over Europe & the Jrws did an incredible job of saving lives & standing alone in all the world...NO ONE made a single protest or offered help...while they were massacred by the millions.  The Vatacan enabled Eichmans escape after WW II when the U S wanted to try him for war crimes!  Arendt was a shameful arrogant woman & I'm sorry I spent any time learning about her life.

It was not an accident that Hannah Arendt, a German, took apart the theory that the evil is a genius. Arendt realized that the evil didn't sing like Cesare Siepi. The evil, instead, had an annoying falsetto voice.

My first impression was how simple this movie was. I missed some epic elements. But at the end I realized the complexity of the story that Margarethe von Trotta told us. It is a movie made with ensembles. It is not easy to put 5 and 6 people around a dinner table talking about politics and current events. Or a professor speaking at a classroom. Or someone reading a letter or talking about his or her feelings with someone else. It looks simple because everything is done naturally. We witness these people talking to each other and all of a sudden we are there with them. Thats what I call director talent.

Kafka said it again and again both Process and The castle. So, when someone is able to give up the ability to think , essential quality of every human being who claims to be and voluntarily becomes a single piece of a gigantic clockwork , the banality of evil occurs .

In this regard, it should return to a keen observation bounded by Mircea Eliade who defines the triviality as the absence of psychological stress . In other words, the triviality waive the most important value of the human condition , the supreme good : freedom. Failure is not a simple consequence of my will, I don't domain it, escapes from me, before me and holds me. Is another. Me and the other. But as I only obey, I don't exist. It is the other.

Nietzsche predicted that historical science was reduced to the role of assistant state nihilism .

5929513,4,B00EO2I6XS,"German screenwriter, film professor, producer and director Margarethe Von Trotta`s thirteenth feature film which she co-wrote with American screenwriter Pamela Katz, is inspired by a biography from 1982 by American author and psychotherapist Elisabeth Young-Bruehl (1946-2011) and real events in the life of a 20th century German-Jewish political theorist. It premiered in the Special Presentations section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the German Cinema section at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on location in America, Israel and Luxembourg and is a Germany-Luxembourg-France co-production which was produced by producers Johannes Rexin and Bettina Brokemper. It tells the story about a 54-year-old emigrant and thinker named Hannah Arendt who lives in an apartment in New York City, USA with her husband and professor in philosophy named Heinrich Blcher. In 1960, SS lieutenant colonel Adolf Eichmann who had been helped by the Roman Catholic Church to escape from Austria to Argentina is captured and kidnapped in Buenos Aires, Argentina by Mossad agents and taken to Jerusalem, Israel where he is to be convicted for crimes against humanity. In the summer of June in 1961 whilst the world is awaiting the upcoming trial which is to be broadcasted on Israeli television, Hannah is given the demanding assignment of covering the event by American journalist William Shawn at The New Yorker.

Distinctly and precisely directed by German filmmaker Margarethe Von Trotta, this finely paced and somewhat fictional, though probably as truthful as possible, tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character`s point of view, draws a conscientious and revering portrayal of the adversity a University teacher and former Zionist is faced with after writing a ten-page essay about a war criminal called Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil"" which becomes very controversial, and how her interpretation of this widely discussed historical event and its subject matters affected her friendship with a German-Jewish philosopher named Hans Jonas whom she studied with at the University of Marburg, Germany in the 1920s and a German-Jewish Zionist leader named Kurt Blumenfeld whom she worked with in Germany in the early 1930s. While notable for its distinct and atmospheric milieu depictions, reverent and distinguishable cinematography by French cinematographer and director Caroline Champetier, production design by production designer Volker Schaefer, costume design by costume designer Frauke Firl, make-up by make-up artist Astrid Weber and use of colors and light, this character-driven and dialog-driven story about the importance of independent thinking, the historical consequences of totalitarianism and the origins of evil where the narrative is driven by the protagonist`s consistent contemplation and an incisively intellectual and profoundly humane woman from Hanover, Germany is wrongfully accused of having defended one of the ""many"" participants of the extermination of Jews whom she regarded as a mediocre nobody and bureaucrat who was incapable of thinking due to his unconditional obedience to his leader and of blaming the Jewish people for what they were subjected to by the Nazis during the Second World War, depicts a refined and eloquent study of character and contains a timely score by composer Andr Mergenthaler.

This revising, informative, quietly romantic, at times humerous and ingeniously and virtuously anti-totalitarian character piece which is set in Germany, Israel and America in the 1920s, 1950s and early 1960s, which reconstructs poignant events in Hanna Arendt`s life and where a prominent author who had a romance with one of her most significant teachers in philosophy named Martin Heidegger, who after being arrested by the Gestapo in the 1930s for her Zionist activities fled from her homeland to Paris, France where she began rescuing young European Jews, who managed to escape from an internment camp in Gurs, France in the early 1940s and who had friendships with a German expatriate named Lotte Khler and an American writer named Mary McCarthy, confronts a 55-year-old father, husband and SS-Oberststrmbannfhrer and writes a thesis which addressed critical questions and both challenged and changed peoples` perceptions of the Holocaust, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, rhythmic continuity, efficient use of archival footage, concentrated and commanding style of filmmaking, atmospheric flashback scenes, the masterfully understated acting performance by German actress Barbara Sukowa and the engaging acting performances by English actress Janet McTeer and German actors Axel Milberg and Ulrich Noethen.

5929515,4,B00EO2I6XS,"If you only use the two words ""Good"" and ""Evil,"" I can easily prove that half of the people are the former and half of the people are the latter, regardless of population.  Don't believe me?  With any population, all of the individuals of that population, no matter what trait you are considering, fall into a standard bell curve.  Let's just say that the people that we call ""Evil"" fall into the left half, and the people that we call ""Good"" fall into the right half.  It's that simple.

And this holds across time as well.  As time moves forward, the bell shifts as well -- I would argue that the bell has shifted continuously to the left over time, but even if it hasn't it's not important -- and the center of the bell just shifts the same amount either way.  Yes, sad but true; half of the people in the world are ""Evil"" if you only take into account these two black and white possibilities.  But then again, half of the people are ""Good"" as well.  At least the glass is half full.  Or is that half empty?

But in reality, only allowing the concepts of ""Good"" and ""Evil"" is an either-or fallacy.  Surely there are other options; surely some people fall somewhere in-between.  Even Adolph Eichmann himself surely wasn't completely ""Evil,"" if you consider pure evil to be someone like, oh, say, Satan.  Surely Mr. Eichmann must have had some good qualities.  And to some extent, this was Hannah Arendt's argument, although I believe that she would just say that Mr. Eichmann was rather boring.  And typical.  Even banal.

There were several themes going on in this film, one of them perhaps being, ""Those that are not guilty may throw the first stone.""  But I believe that irony was actually more important here.  If you watch this film, and you think about it (Ms. Arendt believed that people were losing the ability to simply think and that made it impossible for them to have morals; I think that she was onto something) you will suddenly realize the unbelievable irony that she found herself in after her essay was published in the newspapers.  Mr. Eichmann was punished by the establishment for NOT taking a dissenting opinion, from the Germans' perspective; while Ms. Arendt was punished FOR taking the dissenting opinion, from the American's and Jewish perspective.  Sure, you could easily argue that both were wrong -- it wasn't necessary for one of them to be right -- but I believe that Ms. Arendt was strictly speaking fact, or at least a reasonable version of it, without emotion.

I have not read Ms. Arendt's book ""Eichmann in Jerusalem,"" but I have now pushed it onto my shopping list, and plan on reading it someday, especially after watching this very thought-provoking movie.  Yes, it will make you think.  But wasn't that the original idea, at least according to Ms. Arendt?  Even if she was ""wrong"" -- a tricky thing to prove either way as, by definition, opinion can never be wrong -- she, and this film, accomplished the main goal.

This film is surely not for everyone.  If you don't like to think while you're watching a film, it's definitely not for you.  But if you want to contemplate strictly the meaning of ""Good and Evil"" (and surely more than that), then I'll go with a big recommendation for you here.",1386633600,2,3236,4.618213660245184
