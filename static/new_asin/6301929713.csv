7816735,5,6301929713,"Sonny Liston was the hardest hitter of all time, with George Foreman a close second.  If you look at the number of first and second round knockouts of champions and top contenders, then you will agree with me.  Floyd Patterson and Cleveland Williams at the hands of Sonny; Joe Frazier and Ken Norton at the hands of Big George.

The problem with these big punchers was that they lacked defense at the hands of a skilled boxer, who stayed out of range of their big punches. Another problem was their lack of stamina or endurance.  Since most of their opponents were knocked out by the third round, they did not really train to go the distance, although Sonny Liston's performance in the twelve-round fight with Eddie Machen was commendable. A third problem was that they could not really take a punch and if you could sneak in a good one, then they would fall down. A fourth problem was that they did not have the will to keep fighting right to the last minute.",1176768000,,960,4.5

7816738,1,6301929713,"The video itself was OK, but failed to mention the greatest punchers in boxing history! Max Baer, Ron Lyle, and the hardest puncher of the 20th Century (Earnie Shavers) If this video intended to educate those who didn't know, it failed miserably. Just ask ""Big George"" if Ron Lyle can punch or not!",975024000,10,298,4.6415094339622645
