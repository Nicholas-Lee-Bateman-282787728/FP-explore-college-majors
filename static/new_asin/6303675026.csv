699532,5,6303675026,"Those zany guys at National Lampoon's have topped even Animal House with this one. I have watched Loaded Weapon 1 in excess of 100 times, and my brother and I still rewind and see some of our favorite parts again.  An  all-star cast spoofs many movies, but some of the best parts are the  wittisms that run through this movie, like the Chiefs response to Luger's  request to take the York case.
Luger: York had uncovered a drug  operation, I think that's what got her killed.
Chief (eating): You don't  think it was bullets?
 In my personal opinion, which I consider to be the  right one, Loaded Weapon 1 is one of the greatest cinematographical works  ever.",921283200,,658,4.555555555555555
699725,5,6303675026,"Saw this again last night, having watched it when I was a kid when it first came out.  This great parody movie of the Lethal Weapon movies as well as a lot of other cop buddy flicks, has a lot of great lines in it, I was surprised I remembered most of them just before each was delivered. I've always remembered the ""I'm You're Worst Nightmare"" response, and its still as funny after all these years.  I'd forgotten the sheer number of cameos that were in this film too, from Charlie Sheen to Bruce Willis.  Basically if an actor was employed by this studio and was either a parody movie or an action movie/TV star, they were in this for at least a few seconds.  Of course Emilio Estevez and Samuel L Jackson play the two main Riggs and Murdoch parody characters and really had a lot of fun with this one.",1485302400,,805,4.276315789473684

My fav is the Bruce Willis cameo. So Bruce, so LW.

Great cameos, great moments revisited. No worries about getting bogged down with plot. You know it already. The villains are even the same. If you take LW, Die Hard, seriously, you might get upset about this one. If you enjoyed the ridiculousity of those classics, you'll enjoy this. A few breaking the fourth wall moments, but not overdone.

I don't know why, it wouldn't tell me about the double feature at least on the disc. I could understand if they sent me the wrong movie by accident, but wtf?

700735,5,6303675026,"This is a very funny movie.  National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon, a take off spoof of the Lethal Weapon series, is a hilarious, often slap stick comedy that is certain to entertain comedy lovers everywhere.  My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we are already planning a second viewing.

Two troubled detectives, Sergeant Colt (Emilio Estevez) and Sergeant Lugar (Samuel L. Jackson) are reluctantly teamed to track down a criminal organization that is spiking Wilderness Girl cookies with drugs.  Colt is deeply troubled by the loss of his loving dog, and Lugar is haunted by the death of his former partner (played by Woopie Goldberg in a cameo).  Their psychological problems occasionally lead to memory flashbacks as side scenes that almost steal the movie.

The bad guys are brilliantly played by William Shatner as General Mortars, psychotic crime boss, and Tim Curry as the General's bloodthirsty, but rather inept, enforcer.  Kathy Ireland is excellent as the head of the Wilderness Girls Cookies.

Loaded Weapon 1 is replete with sight gags.  If one carefully watches you can see objects out of place, strange writing on walls, pictures on appliances, sub scenes just barely off center stage.  You see references to other movies in which these actors  starred (like Star Trek, Police Academy, Stakeout and Beverly Hills Cop)

National Lampoons Loaded Weapon1 is a fun film.  I recommend it for a good laugh to cheer you when you are sad, and to comedy lovers everywhere.",1308441600,2,1476,5.0

Thankfully it's one of the few in the genre that's not produced by the Waynes brothers so it has some real laughs. Corny yes but it fits the time period so well. You know what to expect under the National Lampoons name. To us it's an old classic in the good youthful days of the 90's.

The film takes stabs at quite a few classics from the 90's including Leathal Weapon, Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct, and Wayne's World. It's centered around a rogue cop named Jack Colt (Estevez) who teams up with Wes Luger (Samuel L Jackson)to bring down a girl scout cookie ring suspecting of lacing their product with cocaine. In order to bring down the Wilderness Girls cookie corporation a lot of cheap laughs must happen along with so many b cameos including Charlie Sheen, Tim Curry, William Shatner, Dennis Leary, Kathy Ireland (the ultimate redneck dream woman), and that ain't no sock in my crotch John Lovitz.

Just a lot of laughs courtesy of a fine b comedy. If you haven't seen this one yet then we must suggest that you do it now, do it now. They intended to make a sequel to the film shortly after it's production. They signed on the cast and even had promotion posters made up, but due to lack of sales they never followed through. Makes us ponder what may have been. Imagine if they never made a Wayne's World 2? To Sid the 2nd installment was far superior, but it may not have worked for Loaded Weapon. I guess we will never know. Well that is unless we decided to start writting the script which we may do at some point.

Finally, you see a beaver materialize in the style of a ""Caddyshack Gopher.""

And then the shootout that York (Estevez) and Luger (Jackson) come upon while looking for a suspect; with the ""Chips"" guys, Ponch and John (who never pulled their guns out during the real show). The shootout is so loud and intense that Ponch has to shoot at John (narrowly missing him) just to get his attention.

 Anyway, Loaded Weapon 1 (a joke in itself) uses the ZAZ approach (you know, the guys who did Airplane! and The Naked Gun), parodying buddy cop movies, mostly the Lethal Weapons. Emilio Estevez is Colt, a loose cannon who leaves a mini-mart in shambles at the start (the highlight, in my opinion) and is obviously supposed to be Mel Gibson. Samuel L. Jackson is Luger, a by-the-book family man (cough, Danny Glover) who's paired with Colt to nab a drug czar (William Shatner) who is smuggling drugs through Wilderness Girl cookies, which gets Luger's old partner (Whoopi Goldberg) killed. Oh yeah, and Colt falls for Kathy Ireland, a babe who should always leave her hair down. Other Lethal Weapon references include Jon Lovitz (YES!) as the Joe Pesci/Leo Getz character, who appears to be dead many times but keeps showing up, Denis Leary has a cameo as someone like Michael Hunksacker in the first Lethal Weapon, and there's other great references, like Colt finding Luger on the toilet (LW 2), Luger yelling ""Cigarette!"" instead of gun like in LW 1, Colt having a dead dog instead of a wife, and so on.
 This movie really is underappreciated. It mocks all the cop movies that are getting old with ease, and even though it's not up to par with Naked Gun or the other ZAZ tries (well, actually, ""Mafia"" and ""Scary Movie 3"" may conflict with that), it does what National Lampoon used to do: make us laugh.",1138147200,,1676,4.60200668896321

701008,4,6303675026,"I'm not a huge fan of slapstick spoofs. I love ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" films, but it's not my favorite genre.
Ironic, then, that I find most spoof movies enjoyable, at the very least, because they're all really, really stupid. There's more quality in ""Airplane!"" than, say, ""Hot Shots!"", but both films are enjoyable, because you have to do absolutely no thinking whatsoever. All you have to do is laugh a few times. And with the millions of jokes (okay, hundreds) per film, you're sure to find at least a handful of things worth laughing at.
""National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1"" is one of my favorite spoof flicks. Why? It's stupid, silly, funny, and one of the most enjoyable films available to see. Yeah, it's stupid, like I already said. But it's loads of fun, too. And I don't care if critics bashed it when it came out -- it's still a very fun movie.
Everything gets lampooned in this: ""Lethal Weapon"" to ""Die Hard"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" to ""CHiPs."" And, alongside ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""; ""Austin Powers in Goldmember""; and ""The Player,"" it has some of the most cameos/stars to date. Get this: Emilio Estevez, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Curry, Jon Lovitz, William Shatner, Denis Leary, Erik Estrada, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Bill Nunn, Kathy Ireland, Corey Feldman, J.T. Walsh, Paul Gleason, F. Murray Abraham, Bruce Willis, Phil Hartman (R.I.P.), Whoopi Goldberg, Charlie Sheen (Emilio's half-brother)...am I missing anyone? Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci would have completed this cast. I wonder if they rejected cameos.
Wes Luger (Jackson) has been assigned a new partner, the loose canon Jack Colt (Estevez), who lost his dog long ago and is now mentally unstable. Luger lost his partner (Goldberg), too, and the effects of the past often catch up with him, so far that he finds it impossible to fire a gun without shaking violently and spastic-like.
General Mortars (Shatner) is planning a devious scheme of running drugs through a Girl Scout cookie-type company, and Colt and Luger try to thwart his plan and save the day before it's too late. Meanwhile, they come to appreciate each other -- while lampooning everything in sight.
The most puzzling thing about ""Loaded Weapon 1"" is the fact that, if you look at most user comments on the Internet Movie Database, they're all quite positive. It has a low standing at 5.3 stars, yes, but the user reviews for the film are pretty decent. A lot of people found the film ""funny for what it is."" I do, too.
Spoofing a spoof is kinda pathetic, I'll admit. ""Lethal Weapon"" always was more tongue-in-cheek comedy than anything else. Even as a hard action film it was always winking at the other films of its genre. ""Wayne's World"" isn't exactly a drama of epic proportions, either, come to think of it. Even ""Basic Instinct"" is a hard film to spoof, if you take a moment to reflect -- it's never exactly horribly serious. Just sleazy. (I won't ruin how ""Loaded Weapon 1"" pokes fun at the famous Sharon Stone interrogation scene.)
Yet, in my honest opinion, ""Loaded Weapon 1"" does a pretty darn good job of spoofing everything in sight. Estevez is a good Riggs-type who pines for his lost dog (not a wife, mind you, but a dog). Jackson -- who's usually great -- is decent as the Murtaugh-type character, although he is shoved aside by the screenplay to make room for Estevez. (Whose brother was just as good in ""Hot Shots!"", although I think this is a funnier film.) Lovitz, hair bleached (impersonating Joe Pesci from the ""Lethal Weapons""), comes across as an irritant sidekick who appears out of thin air only when the plot needs him -- which I suppose was the point. (Was ""Loaded Weapon 1"" assuming that Joe Pesci's Leo Getz character was an irritating co-star placed in the film as nothing more than an easy plot device? Probably.)
And in one of the simplest -- but also one of the most effective -- scenes, we get the famous bathroom bomb sequence from ""Lethal Weapon 2"" told in an entirely fresh perspective. Here's how it goes: The door to Jackson's house is wide open. Estevez walks in and calls him. ""I'm up here!"" is the response. Estevez walks up the stairs, gets to the bathroom, opens the door, sees Jackson on the toilet and says, ""What are you doing?"" Safe to say, he's doing exactly what it looks like. His blunt reply is one of the highlights of the film. (Let's face it, that scene from ""LW2"" was destined to get poked fun at some time or another -- I'm just glad it got spoofed in this.)",1073520000,3,4480,4.657828282828283

You know, kinda like the `Naked Gun' flicks, but even more over-the-top. Only problem is, most of the gags fall flat, or were just plain dumb. Add Jon Lovitz (a poor man's Leo Getz) and William Shatner (the leader of the bad guys), two of Hollywood's most sure-fire movie-killers, and you'll be looking to UNload your weapon on the fools who came up with this nonsense!
There are a few upsides, however. I thought Emilio Estevez and Samuel L.

But, other than these few bright spots, there's not much else to like about this subpar spoof.

This movie is a rollicking good time, especially when you are drunk.",1002672000,,735,4.935483870967742
701298,4,6303675026,"Man oh man is this a funny movie.  Some of the jokes are a little flat, but this movie will definitely get most people laughing.  The DVD is pretty impressive, you wouldn't think a comedy like this would have such nice picture and sound quality.  Movies like The Naked Gun have far worse quality.  But it sure is great to see Samuel Jackson in a goofball role when all you see him in now are serious roles.  The scene where they take the kids bikes is definitely my favorite.  Look for lots of cameos also.",996364800,,506,4.273684210526316
701299,3,6303675026,"Make that 3.5 Stars. Now this isn't the perfect spoof movie (It's no Airplane or Naked Gun) but it does have it's moments and a cast that almost always succeeds in being funny.  Samuel Jackson and Emilio Estevez play detective/partners Lugar and Colt (Yes, they're names of guns) in this send up of ""Lethal Weapon"" (Duh).  It also finds time to make fun of films like ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Basic Instinct"",and ""Wayne's World"", among others.  If you have never seen Samuel Jackson in a comedic perfomance - you're missing something.  Also, if you've never seen Samuel Jackson headbanging to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" while driving, then you are really missing something. Jackson basically plays straight man to Emilio's psycho.  William Shatner steals his scenes as the Detective's arch nemesis, General Mortars.  Look for the scene where Shatner and Curry pay Mike (Leary) a visit after they find out he's a snitch.  Shatner dunks his head into a tank of vicious pirahna and comes out with one in his mouth - Priceless!  Also look for a hilarious cameo by Bruce Willis, when the bad guys accidentally blow up his home instead of Colt's.  ""Yeah, no problem, no problem!""
Other cast and cameos you will laugh it:  Tim ""Where is the Meecrofilm?"" Curry,  Jon ""money laundry"" Lovitz,  Kathy ""Miss Demeanor"" Ireland,  Lance ""Dry itchy scalp"" Kinsey (Proctor, from Police Academy),  F. ""It means I'm pretentious"" Murray Abraham,  Denis ""You really got me"" Leary,  Phil ""Stand up cop"" Hartman,  Whoopi ""No, no, I'll beg now"" Goldberg,  Dr. Joyce ""This loser took the chicken sh-t way out"" Brothers,  James ""I'm giving her all she's got, Captain"" Doohan,  Cory ""It was me, Sarge"" Feldman,  Richard ""To the right, right!"" Moll (Bull from Night Court),  Erik ""Ponch"" Estrada and Larry ""John"" Wilcox from ""CHiPs"",  and  Charlie ""the valet"" Sheen, who says to Lugar (Jackson) in response to his tip for his valet services, ""Got anything smaller?""  Lugar: ""Keep it.""  Valet: ""Got anything larger?""  Lugar: ""Yeah.""
More funny dialogue? Ok:
General Motors: Sea Monkeys?  Mike: Pirahna.  GM: Their lives exude a beautiful simplicity; savage, ruthless; existing only to devour and destroy; to taste blood; to rend flesh.  Sounds like me right?
Lugar: What do you have, Irv?  Irv: Oh, I'm not sure Sarge.  It's a nagging, itching, burning sensation.  Lugar: What the hell do you expect? Your foots on fire.
Lugar: Coffee Ted?  Doris Lugar: Ted is from a disfunctional family.  Lugar: Oh, so no coffee.",995760000,5,2487,4.997555012224939

There are so much hidden jokes who makes this movie brilliant. I hope this review will make you, ... has made you curious enough to lend it for a funny afternoon. CU",993513600,,297,4.137931034482759
701301,4,6303675026,"Many critics have reviewed this film as being a disgrace to the National Lampoon name. How can they claim that? All National Lampoon films are based on slapstick humor, and most are spoofs on other serious films. Loaded  Weapon 1 is no different, taking off of Mel Gibson and Danny Glovers' rolls  in Lethal Weapon 1 & 2. There is even a take off from a famous Silence  Of The Lambs scene with F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Leacher.  With all the  spoof and slapstick moments, the requirements for a National Lampoon film  are definitely met with this hilarious, underrated comedy.
Emilio  Estevez is Jack Colt, a trigger happy, individual who has it out for  everyone since the dog napping of his Golden Retriever. Colt's soon to be  partner, Wes Lugar, is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who's about to retire  from the force. The two become partners when Sergeant York (Whoopi  Goldberg), is murdered.  Tim Curry is hysterical in this scene as the  Wilderness Girl murderer. From there the plot thickens with numerous take  offs from famous films, guaranteed to crack you up.
To say the least this  is one of the funniest National Lampoon films to date. It may also be one  of the best slapstick/spoof films as well. Don't believe the critics when  they say Loaded Weapon 1 is one of the worst Nation Lampoon productions. Go  rent it and see for yourself . If you are a true lover of spoof comedies or  slapstick in general, this film will be extremely enjoyable and possibly a  favorite.",964051200,5,1483,4.630769230769231

Jackson) try to stop thugs from  sending Girl Scout cookies around with cocaine in them. Funny at sometimes,  but get's old at some points. Also stars Jon Lovitz (who is hilarious as  always), Tim Curry, Kathleen Ireland, William Shatner, Charlie Sheen, F.  Murray Abraham, Denis Leary, Phil Hartman, Whoopi Goldberg, Corey Feldman,  Larry Wilcox, and Charles Napier.",959990400,,526,5.365853658536586

LOADED WEAPON 1 is chock-full of laughs just like those found in THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE! The cutest part is at the very end...headbanging in the  car!
Sgt. Colt (Estevez) and Leuger (Jackson) go on a case to find who's  behind the murders in which Wilderness Girls (or... ""Vvvwwilderness  Girls"") Cookies were found on the scene laced with Cocaine.
