530122,5,6302999782,"This is one of the best episodes of Ranma1/2.  In the first episode, Ranma, Genma, and Soun are at one of the many temples in Nermia and are helping a guy put back on a spirt ward to keep the evil orge in a wooden box.  But the orge doesn't stay put and comes out.  They all fear the orge until they see that it is  a freak in a diaper.  The orge possesses people by entering in them.  The only way you can get the orge out is by hitting the person and Ranma has no trouble doing that until the orge gets Kasumi...buy it to find out.  The second episode is my favorite one of all times.  The whole crew (Minus Mousse, Kodachi, Kuno, and Happosi) go to a resort call ""The Doll In.""  The reason the place is called the doll in is because there is a doll that has been there for a long time but the doll is cursed.  Whoever is disrespectful around the doll will be punished.  Of course, Ranma and Genma have a battle for Ranma's milk and are disrespectful in front of the doll and something bad happens to Akane.... It is a must see and if you are a true Ranma fan, you have to see this one",976579200,,1087,3.9631336405529956
530123,5,6302999782,"In this installment, we find out about the one guy Akane did like besides Daddy. And how she has to deal with the fact that his heart is for another meanwhile Ranma learns that Akane can be really nice when he's not making fun of her. We also get a taste of how Ranma really thinks of Akane as well. Do you think that Ranma thinks of Akane as only ""uncute""? You might be surprised that his hard headed stubborness might just have a thing for Akane.",976320000,2,448,4.160919540229885

In the second half, a mysterious  camera-toting stranger comes along and steals the special techniques of the  best martial artists in town!  Will Ranma be able to defeat... himself???

530126,4,6302999782,This is the start of ranma. It's about a boy named Ranma that fell in a cursed pond and now he turns into a girl whenever he touches cold water and turns back when he touches hot. This is one of the best anime series ever.  If u haven't seen this your missing out. This anime show has alot of action  and comedy.

530129,4,6302999782,In this volume we find out that Akane has a crush on Dr. Tofu but Dr. Tofu already has someone that he loves. This tape has one of those rare scenes where Ranma and Akane actually get along...untill they start fighting again  that is.  This tape has some brief nudity.,949968000,,268,4.34
530130,4,6302999782,"I just recently saw this video for my first time.  To be perfectly honest, I really enjoyed it!  I like the way that the first episode (""Hell Hath no Fury Like Kasumi Scorned!"") seemed to pay attention to the  more neglected charactors in the series, such as the loveably oblivious  housewife Kasumi.  The first episode deals with an ""evil"" demon  wandering around people's bodies.  Ironically, it freeloads in tranquil  Kasumi for the longest time.  There is a hilarious scene in which Ryouga is  possessed.  The second episode (""The Two Akanes.  Ranma, Look at  Me!"") takes a more sinister approach to demonic possession.  Ranma  desturbs an eerie-looking porcelain doll who holds vendettas.  She  retalliates by possessing Akane and using her body to get Ranma into a  compromising position.  This contains haunting images which stayed with me  for a while, and is quite scary for a Ranma video.",944784000,,898,5.02054794520548
530150,5,6302999782,This is just as good as the first Ranma 1/2.  I mean I am a huge fan of Ranma and this shows Ranma at his best.  I would have to warn people thought that the content of the video is sort of mature (it should be a 13+  like battle athletes.)  Still this is a great video and very fun to watch.,931392000,,292,3.661290322580645

In the first OAV, Kasumi is taken over by a strange little demon, which nobody can get rid of, since the only way to remove it is by hitting someone. ^^;; (don't worry, they figure it  out ^.-) In the second OAV, Akane's body is taken over by a doll, and her  soul is placed in the body of the doll. How will she warn Ranma if she  can't even talk? This tape is very good, but I wish I had gotten in  subtitled. ~*sighs*~ I recommend it to any Ranma 1/2 or anime fan, but get  it subbed!!",915840000,,527,3.980952380952381

7833371,4,6302999782,"This is the video of the anime only ""Egg catcher man"" I like this episode because it focuses alot on Kasumi/Dr. Tofu relationship. THe second episode os like the manga, where Kuno wins the Wishbringer. The magical sword will grant its owner three wishes, so Ranma*Pigtailed Girl*goes on a date with THe ""Blue Thunder"" to get him to wish away a ""feminine problem"" TEE HEE! Both episodes are great!

7833372,4,6302999782,"This one is one of the best in the Hard Battle series. Back to the Happosai is really funny and you even get a little insight on Happosai and Cologne.
Happy is having a garage sale and he's having no luck selling anything until Shampoo shows up on a delivery to the Tendo dojo with some special ramen for the Tendos. Shampoo offers Happy 10 cents for an antique mirror and then Happy realizrs that it's his Magic Mirror. When a single tear drop from the holder touches the mirror, the holder will go back to the time he most likely wants to be. After a chance of luck, Shampoo, Cologne, Ranma, Akane, Soun and Genma find themselves in Cologne's village... 300 years ago!!!
This one is great and it has one of the funniest lines that I;ve heard so far...
""but Master, we thought you looked like this?""
""You go Tendo!""
Episode, the Tendo Dojo is flat broke and down to nearly nothing. Now it's up to Ranma and Akane to find a way to make the dojo some money. However overhearing this, Sasuke brings the news back to Kodachi and she decides that there is only one thing left to do and that's marry Ranma! Will Koadchia gfet her way and marry her true love or will Akane be able to make Ranma and Genma see the light?
Like I said, great tape, very funny and a lot of laughs. I took off a star for the usual reason whenever I have to hear Kodachi's voice. Seriously, I can deal in the Japanese version slightly better than the English version. That laugh just pierces my ears whenever I hear it. Anyway, still a vwery good tape. Check it out!",1047600000,,1537,4.285223367697594
7833373,4,6302999782,"This tape is all about Akane and the neighborhood chiropractor, Dr Tofu. Some new plot twists here like how Akane sees Dr Tofu as more than just her doctor and also how Dr Tofu feels about someone else. Oh and his skeleton Betty!
Also in this one, Kuno admits defeat and tries to proclaim his love to both Akane and Ranma (girl). This one also has one of the funniest lines in the 1st TV series...
""Tatewaki Kuno was Furinkan High's greatest champion""
""He's also the biggest PERVERT!""
""WHO ARE YOU CALLING A PERVERT?!""
I'm not really too fond of how Akane feels about Dr Tofy because it's not told really well it's a little boring. But the laughs that come with this tape are priceless. Check it out!",1047427200,,700,4.434108527131783
7833374,4,6302999782,"By coming into contact with the comic books a few years back, the TV series was what I would expect from a Janpanese animation basing on the story books.  I won't go into the details of the actual story, I'm sure if you are deciding to buy this box set, you must already have some idea about the story line. Overall, the quality of the actual animation is upto a Janpanese TV series standard, although the graphics are inferior to the movies, but the imaginative story line have more than made up for this.  However, what only give it a four star is that the series itself was too short, each tape just containing 2 episodes, which I think, is slightly over priced.  But on the other hand, the series have great humour through out, and adding a ""difference"" to it from all the other animation I've seen, which make this abit less childish, this cartoon is definetly not for kids, because it is aimed at a higher age group audience.  Ranma 1/2 is a must see, but try to get a used copy if you can, provided it is not damaged in anyway, which makes it a better valued buy.",999561600,,1070,4.308457711442786

And all when they are doused with cold water. This is the plot of Ranma 1/2. The story of a boy named Ranma who, ever since falling into a cursed spring at ""Jusenkyo"", turns into a girl with cold water and a boy with hot water. He returns from China to meet Akane... his fiance (which was decided by thier fathers when they were young) Watch as Akane and Ranma's ""relationship"" is put through many (most of which are extremely odd) hardsdhips, like Kodachi.
