7892803,3,6305641005,"In the early 80's, local television stations broadcasted various martial art films, apparently during the so-called kung fu craze.  Aside from Shaw Brother films, some lesser movies made it on the airwaves, which included Crack Shadow Boxer.  The basic plot follows the traditional story that is enlisted in allot of kung fu films.  Two weary travelers, one played by the immortal Ku Feng (probably the single actor that has played in the most Shaw Brother and kung fu movies) and Kwok Choi Hon (a Gordon Liu, master killer proto-type) enters a small town in the controls of an evil gang, mistaken the travelers for two fighters hired by the town.  Ku Feng and Kwok Choi Hon are essentially free loaders, passing off gimmicker medicines, trying to make an unhonest buck.  With a failed attempt of the gang weeding the travelers out, they hire a killer to annihilate them.  True to their form, the travelers leaves the town, in fear of their own life.

Even though it sounds mellow dramatic, the films is essentially a cantonese comedy.  What sets it apart from other kung fu flicks is it impressive martial art fights, with Kwok Choi Hon displaying his impressive acrobatic skills.  A funny supporting character envolves a woman know as ""The Tigeress"" that has had eleven husbands, which have all unceremoniously died, to the unfortuneness of Ku Feng becoming the twelve husband.

I personally enjoyed this movie, not by it sophistication as an kung fu flick, but by the humor and good martial art fighting sequences.  If you like senseless kung fu comedy action, check it out.  The Crash Cinema dvd version is presented in widescreen, with a surprisingly good transfer.  The original film print seems to stand up very well, making it that much more enjoyable.",1173398400,,1760,4.905405405405405

7892805,3,6305641005,This movie could have been better if the actors weren't so goofy. Humor in kung fu films is usually a standard. But the two main stars in this one sometimes makes the movie unwatchable. Good fights scenes though.,1005177600,,212,4.605263157894737
