This film was made with such heart, honesty, and intelligence.  It tells such a fascinating story, in such a  beautiful way.  The content is challenging and breathtaking, but the story told is also thoughtfully subtle and sincere.  Do yourself good and buy it!",1272412800,,389,4.347222222222222
4042210,5,B002ZTQV98,"This is a nuanced and fascinating look at the life of civil rights lawyer William Kunstler. Especially for those who came of age since the 1970s, this film will provide an education about some important moments in American history. It encourages us not to avoid confronting racism and other kinds of discrimination both within ourselves and all around us, and it is as relevant now as the activities of William Kunstler were decades ago. His daughters, the filmmakers, keep his spirit alive both by celebrating and questioning their father's activities. You won't quite look at the world in the same way after taking this journey.",1272412800,,630,5.0095238095238095
4042211,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film touched me in so many ways. As a student of human struggles for freedom and justice, this biography of Bill Kunstler actually opened some new doors for me. I think everything covered in this documentary was either never mentioned in school when I was growing up or was only casually glossed over. Emily and Sarah Kunstler deal with it from an intimate perspective that brings these events to life -- many of them pivotal moments in American history of the 1960s, 70s and 80s -- in a way that fleshes out some of the difficult moral decisions made by this man, who was often at the center of it all.

I predict ""William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe"" will become required viewing and as vital to the movement as Howard Zinn's ""People's History of the United States."" Why aren't these events discussed more often and more openly? This important film offers some insights as to why. Definitely get this DVD!",1272412800,,918,4.701863354037267
4042212,5,B002ZTQV98,"Distrubing the Universe documents the life  of William Kunstler . Written and directed by the daughters Kunstler, it is both personal and asks us to not only remember and preserve  the past but to also use this example  to think about what to do now. It is entertaining in the best sense and deeply moving.",1265155200,5,306,4.527272727272727
4042213,5,B002ZTQV98,"This is a fascinating, engaging, and balanced portrait of the civil rights attorney William Kunstler. The film documents Mr. Kunstler's life and career from his military service during WWII to his early years practicing law in Westchester County to his transformation into a leading civil rights figure and his eventual career as a criminal defense attorney in NYC. Made by his two daughters, the film also tells the story of both the challenges and the inspiration that resulted from growing up with Mr. Kunstler as a father. The filmmakers are not uncritical of their father and don't hesitate to question the motives behind some of Mr. Kunstler's decisions.

The film includes interviews with an impressive cast of individuals who knew Mr. Kunstler or were involved with the cases he argued. These include well known figures Jimmy Breslin, Bobby Seale, and Julian Bond, among others, and lesser known figures including a juror from the Chicago Conspiracy trial and an Attica prison guard. The filmmakers also make excellent use of archival footage and photographs, both from mainstream media and from Mr. Kunstler's personal life.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in civil rights history, activism, and American justice.",1265155200,10,1247,5.261306532663316

4042215,2,B002ZTQV98,"I was mesmerized by Kunsler until he came to my university campus during the height of student protests in 1970.  He pontificated and got students in an emotional uproar with no real message except to take over an administration.  He weaved his words over and over so that he couldn't be accused of inciting a riot. He continued and continued on and on hoping the students would engage in anarchy.  Instead, the crowd got tired and the emotions lost out to reason.  He wanted to be in charge of a movement, but there was no real cause except for his self-aggrandizement.  I never felt positive about him after that.  I know he championed some causes, but underneath he did it for personal glory and profit not because he had deep convictions and that showed during his speech at my campus.",1321660800,3,789,4.6
4042216,5,B002ZTQV98,This is a moving and amazing view of Mr. Kunstler. Every American should see this. It's sad that we have nobody to replace him .,1317254400,,128,4.16
4042217,4,B002ZTQV98,"Caught this documentary on William Kunstler on PBS today.
Made by his daughter's it is a fascinating account of a lawyer that shaped the times I was raised within....certainly I recall him there in the times....at the end his daughter's state they were looking for a single unifying theory to present their Dad. Perhaps they got that right in his standing up to injustice.
He speaks to his willingness to do that when it isn't easy. The film clips, the cases recounted, the life history is utterly fascinating. Maybe because I lived in these times more so to me. Perhaps the strongest moment is late in the film when he talks of all the injustice cloaked in ""legality"" that man is capable of doing, has done. Presented after the timeline of his life, after his death as an enduring message. It makes you stop and think.
After the movie I'm watching his daughter talk about the love her father had for the jury system, as well as the obligation a person has to speak out and speak to injustice. To make choices. A lesson they feel taught to them by their father. A fascinating POV.",1302912000,,1080,4.543589743589743
4042218,4,B002ZTQV98,"Don't let the fact that the documentary ""William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe"" was produced, written and directed by his two daughters, Emily and Sarah, lead you to assume that this is just some reflexive puff-piece on the man and his life.  Indeed, with a scrupulous desire for balance and fairness, the filmmakers acknowledge the controversial nature of their father and his work, while at the same time evincing the love and affection any daughters would feel for a devoted parent.  In fact, they even admit that, as youngsters, the sisters often disagreed with the types of cases he was willing to take on and the types of people he was willing to defend (gang-rapists, assassins, Islamic terrorists), and often lived in fear for their own safety due to those choices.  But with maturity comes the longer view, and now the Kunstler girls are able to appreciate more fully their father`s unwavering belief that true justice can be achieved only when it applies to everyone equally - those we love and admire as well as those we hate and fear.

Kunstler was, of course, the civil rights attorney who became a household name when he served as lead counsel for the Chicago 7 in the late 1960s, an act for which he served several months in prison on charges of ""contempt of court,"" a sentence that was later overturned.  But it was this trial - and the obviously unjust way in which the defendants were treated (especially Bobby Seale) - that forever ""radicalized"" Kunstler, making him see the American legal system as a racist machine hell bent on discriminating against minorities and the poor and those who lacked favor in the eyes of society.  After this crucial turning point, Kunstler dedicated his life and his career as a defense attorney to full-time anti-war and civil rights activism, which garnered him the near-constant attention of an ever-suspicious FBI.  Kunstler was actively involved in trying to bring peaceful resolutions to the famous standoffs at Attica (where he clearly did not succeed) and Wounded Knee (where he did).

It was in the second half of his career, when, in his capacity as a criminal defense attorney for the city of New York, he began defending some pretty loathsome characters - he is even shown physically embracing John Gotti - that many of his former supporters, including his daughters, began to question his moral convictions.  But Kunstler, who died in 1995, always maintained that every person accused of a crime was entitled to a vigorous defense, and it is this philosophy that ultimately won over many of his critics and even his daughters in the end.

A mixture of file footage and interviews with numerous people who both knew Kunstler personally or were deeply affected by his work, the documentary itself is fairly conventional in style and form, but its portrait of a man who insisted, often at great personal risk to himself and his family, that all people be given a fair trial - and of his daughters' growing understanding and eventual acceptance of what he was all about - makes it truly inspiring.",1297036800,,3061,4.869230769230769
4042219,5,B002ZTQV98,"Yes, William Kunstler was right and you were wrong, even if you are one of his two daughters who made the engrossing documentary about the late, great attorney, WILLIAM KUNSTLER: DISTURBING THE UNIVERSE.  The children of Kunstler and his second wife, Emily and Sarah Kunstler were too young to remember his most noteworthy acts and not yet born for some.  The striking exception is William Kunstler's final great work defending Yusef Salaam, whom New York authorities wrongly accused in the 1989 Central Park Jogger assault, as we see the Kunstler sisters, coming of age, not wanting their father to take the teen-age defendant's case.

Emily and Sarah were wrong.  William Kunstler was right.  Not that the sisters or their father could prove guilt or innocence, though.  The point is, the Kunstler daughters were wrong to think Salaam was not worthy of due process.  William Kunstler, regardless of what he felt in his heart about the accused, was right to think he was.

Many describe William Kunstler as a ""radical attorney,"" but all that means is he understood the right of every American to a fair trial.  When your emotions and prejudices have you so sure of otherwise, remember what everyone thought about Yusef Salaam and the other Central Park Jogger assault suspects that summer of 1989.

4042220,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film is a biography of William Kunstler, a notable civil rights attorney who came to national prominence in America during the ""Chicago 7"" trial and who subsequently defended many famous clients including the American Indian Movement, the prisoners of Attica prison in upstate New York, Catholic anti-war protesters who burned draft board records and many others.  Kunstler's legacy is one that will inspire us for generations!",1278460800,,432,5.447761194029851
4042221,5,B002ZTQV98,This was a well done documentary.  My husband is a criminal defenmse lawayer and gained so much from this - it helps those who aspire to be like Huntsler - thank you for this!,1278374400,,175,4.147058823529412
4042222,5,B002ZTQV98,"One of my most memorable evenings of theater was seeing  "" The Chicago Conspiracy Trial"" at the Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles, a quarter-century ago.  The play is based entirely on transcripts of those infamous courtroom scenes, and I `d been so young at the time that I went with no ""position"" on what had happened.  So I just watched it all unfold --  Judge Hoffman, Bobby Seale with the gag in his mouth, the other defendants , and their inspiring defenders;  by the end I was on my feet in tribute.  As the actors were greeting members of the audience, who'd been seated as if in the jury,  the man who played William Kunstler, attorney for the defense, started to walk by.  But then, maybe because he saw the tears streaming down my face and sensed my wish to connect, he back-tracked and leaned in to shake my hand.  I felt so honoured, I have never forgotten that moment.

So when I heard of this film, of course I went to see it, and am very glad I did.  I learned a lot more about this legendary defender of so many who came up against an unjust system, and was reminded of the bravery of many people who take on unpopular defendants .  The law must be equally applied, and everyone - guilty or not - needs an attorney who will fight for them - a point we often forget when we don't like the accused.  Everyone should see this if only for the story of the Central Park Jogger case and Kunstler's defense of those initially blamed and convicted in the ""court"" of popular opinion.  I recommend it most highly; it teaches us about both the law and history in a memorable and inspiring way.",1278374400,,1601,4.328859060402684
4042223,5,B002ZTQV98,"I enjoyed the movie, and it brought back a flood of memories from days gone by. I grew up in the 60's-70's, and I remember Mr. Kunstler well. I cherish most the time when I met him at an environmental conference in Carbondale, IL, back in 1991, if I'm not mistaken. I also had the privilege of having an interesting discussion with him, and a couple of my fellow environmental activists. He was not pretentious, at least when I met him, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. I remember when, during a discussion panel we were having, someone asked him what political party he was a member of, thinking of course he would say democratic, or liberal, or green party. But no, none of them he said, he didn't belong to any political party, and then went on about people he had known who were idealistic and all that, but once they got elected to office and went to Washington, they all fell into the Washington trap- Their priority became getting re-elected, rather then their own idealistic agenda. They became political whores, although that may not be Mr. Kunstler's original words. He also talked about finally doing the paperwork to get his Social Security. Overall, it was a memorable moment and time in my life, almost 20 years ago.
Finally, Mr. Kunstler's daughters, filmmakers Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler did a great job. It was beyond my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although I just might be a little bias. Keep up the good work.
Best wishes always,

4042244,5,B002ZTQV98,"This is a look into the life and cases of William Kunstler. A fascinating man , who chose to take on some of the biggest cases (Chicago 7, Wounded Knee) of his time. I loved it!!",1278374400,,178,3.9722222222222223
4042245,5,B002ZTQV98,"William Kunstler made a difference.  He also made some mistakes along the way....but for the most part the guy was ""right on"".

This gem of a film shot and narrated from the POV of his two daughters captures Kunstler and a human being and as a family man trying to relate to Sarah and Emily as best he could given his schedule.

Clearly, at points he took cases just for the money (even a John Gotti is entitled to a competent defense......so long as he can pay for it) but he also took cases where money was clearly not flowing his way.  The case of the ""Central Park Jogger"" turns out to be one in which a measure of belated justice eventually prevailed...that may never have been pursued but for the efforts of William Kunstler.

Kunstler's exchanges with ""Judge"" Hoffman in the Chicago trial section of the film were painfully hilarious....talk about a kangaroo court!

Sadly, there are too few William Kunstler's in the legal profession.  If there were a thousand like him in that era, America would be a very different place......again, even the efforts of one Kunstler made a difference, and it was good.  Enjoy the movie!",1278288000,,1129,4.63819095477387
4042246,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film is so poetically done, which is not so easy for a historical account. It contains important history that we don't learn about in school. Deeply moving and inspiring.",1277856000,,175,4.866666666666666
4042247,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film is a moment in time that I feel many younger people know little about.  History has a way of skipping generations, especially when the subject is too close in time and very sensitive. Emily and Sarah have brought a time in American History to light in a very sensitive and real way.  It not only touches on the past, but the struggle two daughters have with the present and the past, as they look back on their lives growing up in the home of a man bigger than life.  As a person who grew up during the period that this film looks back on, I am reminded of the turmoil of the times, in a very real way.  At the same time, I am moved by the sensitivity that Emily and Sarah portray the struggle trying to find their place in his life, and in the history of this country.",1277856000,,779,4.105263157894737
4042248,5,B002ZTQV98,This film adds a personal perspective to a turbulent and defining period in our recent history. It is both warm and questioning of the role played by William Kunstler as reflected in the eyes of his two daughters. Highly recommended.,1275091200,,233,4.85
4042249,4,B002ZTQV98,"This is a great documentary, especially for people already interested in Kunstler and/or the law and/or recent American history. As for his last few cases, Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler, the directors and narrators, seem to have trouble understanding why he represented some of the people he did. People like associates of the Gambino crime family and El-Sayyid Nosair, the assassin of the late Jewish leader Rabbi Meir Kahane. It may have something to do with love of law, or love of truth or some other high ideals. But I would guess that he also felt that the whole legal system was faulty and corrupt, and that these high profile cases could reveal the system's problems and deficiencies. In a way, maybe he continued the defiant ""legal theater"" of the Chicago Seven trial, only in a less shocking, more conventional manner.  I'm just guessing, but this documentary seems to be missing something about the man and his ultimate motivations, and it's a bit frustrating. Maybe I'm asking too much to expect the daughters to neatly wrap up the story of their father's innermost thoughts, but I would have preferred that they got closer to the truth than is revealed in the documentary. I'm certainly still thinking about it, and that seems to be one of the aims of this film. Not the last word on Kunstler, though.",1274832000,5,1318,4.8061674008810575
4042250,5,B002ZTQV98,"An excellent movie- my only question- did Kunstler have a previous marriage with children? What happened there? Otherwise, having met Bill myself and agreeing with all of his causes, with only a couple of exceptions- (1st trade center bombing for example),  I felt saddened by the fact that here a unique and rare lawyer is portrayed. Think of this- what is the golden law? it is- ""them with the gold writes the laws!"" This movie portays Kunstler in the best/most known trials of radicals thru the 60's and 70's. It shows what his family had to endure. We can be thankful that K existed as long as he did, bercause in many other countries he would have been killed right away. The U.S. stifles progressive lawyers in its other way- offering up such inducements as money and giving progressive lawyers no recognition or prominence or jailing them. In a country with a right of center Supreme Court- one is happy to see Bill winnning before the highest court in the land. The film ends with a speech by K in which he exposes a system that cloaks itslef in the so called ""respectability"" of the law. But was Jesus killed legally?, he asks-Yes, is his answer? . He posits the possibility that through history more innocent individuals have been killed by courts than by criminals.
Hopefully more such films will be made. We need them in a country where this viewpoint, this perspective is kept very, very quiet by the powers that be.
Daughters, Sarah and Emily have given us a wonderful memorial to a wonderful man. Should be shown in all law schools.",1273622400,16,1547,4.645985401459854
4042251,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film is truly amazing!  What an inspirational life, brilliantly explored by Kunstler's daughters.  I saw DTU at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, and everyone I spoke to afterwards agreed it was one of the highlights of the festival!",1272412800,2,246,5.125
4042252,5,B002ZTQV98,"As this film is put together by two of William Kunstler's daughters, it's a very personal way to view some of the landmark civil rights cases in the US, as they combine their family's history with the history of this country.  The film is indeed the perfect combination of a family's story, civil rights-era history, and an examination of the distinction between legal and just.  It also reminds us that people's actions aren't always black or white, and that sometimes you need to probe beneath the surface to discover the motivations behind certain behavior.  I was born after most of Kunstler's cases took place and don't remember learning much about any of them in school, so for me, the film was a fascinating and enlightening portrayal of the stories that are often glossed over in mainstream history textbooks, which are often the stories that are most worth telling.  It's also a great way for non-history buffs to absorb some knowledge of US history and our legal system, as the personal narratives interwoven throughout the court cases will hold the attention of those drawn more to human interest stories than historical or legal documentaries. I saw the film in theaters twice, and both times the crowds have left the theater chattering about the film and really enthused about the questions that it raised.

I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to examine US history through a very personal and unique lens.",1272412800,3,1436,4.917355371900826
4042253,5,B002ZTQV98,"This film is an inspirational piece about the life and career of William Kunstler. The film covers his transition from a liberal icon, defending the the Attica Prison rioters and Chicago Seven, to his perhaps more controversial involvement in cases, such as the defense of Yusef Salaam, a black 15-year-old accused of participating in a savage attack on a female jogger in Central Park (later exonerated in 2002). It is an educational film that serves as a reminder to question your own assumptions and remain a defender of mankind.",1272412800,2,532,4.98876404494382

He may have loved attention but he always found time to give to those from the boomer generation. Still a teenager, I traveled from his law office to Grand Central Station to his Mamaroneck house (while he penned part of one of his many books on a yellow legal pad). There I met and met Lottie and Jane and Karin, and spent a couple nights there while he caught up on his personal life. He was in the midst of his landmark victory against the Washington DC School Board for their defacto segregationist policy called the ""tracking"" system. Even though it remains relatively unknown in the light of his later work, he always described this case as perhaps the sweetest victory he ever attained. I was there and I understand. Judge J. Skelly Wright's Hobson vs Hansen ruling changed the DC school system forever, for the better!  Even though Emily was not yet of this world at the time, to my delight and amazement she has brought Bill back to life - warts and all -  so that the many who berated him might take another look at this lawyer who rewrote American legal history.
