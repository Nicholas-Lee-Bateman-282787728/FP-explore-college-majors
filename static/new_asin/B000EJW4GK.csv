This film serves as a powerful reminder how far the  Judeo-Christian West has evolved beyond that.  Even so, it is still quite dated for India (2004).  It would be great to get a glimpse of 2017 India  not that marriage equality will be coming anytime soon. Id much rather be reincarnated as a cat in a Jewish household.",1510704000,,463,4.464285714285714
8110757,2,B000EJW4GK,"Since the only 'review' is provided by the distributer, let me at least warn unsuspecting customers of how truly awful this film is.  I got it from the library and so wasn't suckered out of any $ to watch it, but still felt cheated of the 40 minutes of my life (the entire film's running time) I sat through.  While the production values are adequate (barely), this is  really a very stereoptypical and cliched view of one small corner of the Indian homosexual milieu, namely two homely overweight drag queens who roll their eyes and engage in bitchy banter non-stop, while vying for the affection of a dumb would-be actor.  It might provide some small sociological value as one of the few Hindi films depicting gay life, but trust me - it doesn't exactly promote tolerance or understanding.  And it offensively has to trot out an AIDS diagnosis towards the end to provide some sort of emotional response.",1334966400,2,905,4.7025316455696204
8110758,5,B000EJW4GK,"Intimate, sad and humorous simultaneously, Gulabi Aaina, deals with a historical friendship in the purest Bollywood style. Music, songs, choreography enhance a love tangle of a very special quartet. An excellent example of Indian cinema, and it is surprising to know that it has been prohibited in its country.

Sridhar Rangayan's two-year-old short feature ""The Pink Mirror,"" one of the most delightful films in the festival, was the first film about transvestites ever made in India and is banned in its native land. Bitchy banter, drama queen drama, handsome studs, dances and songs--and a dose of grim, health-related reality (to a melodramatic motif from Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly"")--fill its 40 minutes.

To me Gulabi Aaina seems like bridging a gap between say, Fire and Bombay Boys, more so its in Hindi, that in my opinion is adding that breadth of reality that people seem to bypass, the language of the masses... it reminds me of Benegal's Mandi, the black comedy, which is less of a story and more of character plays set in an unashamed, gaudily portrayed, in-your-face bordello.
