3774401,5,B001R8I31W,"I purchased this DVD for my son at a young age, about 6 months old and he has been enjoying it ever since. It includes animation and real footage of the different animals that the video is highlighting which is a nice combination and seems to keep my little one interested. It also has little children that sing a few nursery rhymes that me and my son enjoy together.",1352678400,,367,4.333333333333333
3774402,1,B001R8I31W,Cheaply made and very short videos for the price it is not worth even trying. My kids got bored watching it so fast i am very disappointed,1338422400,,138,4.148148148148148
3774403,3,B001R8I31W,"I'm not an Arab, neither is my husband, but we both studied classical Arabic at a University, and spent almost a year in Syria, so decided to introduce our little daughter (almost 3) to this language. She loved this DVD, and always asks us to put it for her, she enjoys looking at different animals and even memorized them in Arabic, but the songs on this DVD are not in classical Arabic, but in dialect, which makes it extremely difficult for us to understand them and sing along to help her memorizing the words (or even making sense of the song). To make matter worse, there are no subtitles. There is a CD with these songs, but unlike LaliLali CD, that has lyrics printed on its back, this one doesn't contain any. So if you aren't fluent in dialect, tough luck!",1312070400,5,766,4.439716312056738
3774404,5,B001R8I31W,"I got the whole set include animals, shapes, colors and numbers. These are DVD that fit us the best because we want something that teach arabic not religious and have the right acent. I introduced to my baby since he was 6months old now he's 13months old. He can do hand sign follow the animal song since he was 8months old and now he use his tonge make sound along chicken song. I let him watch only once a week change DVD around.
I love the numbers the best. It kinda fun but look like my baby love the animal the most. He got to dance with them.
However, the colors one doesn't pull attention that much. I think the color itself a little bit fade if compare with others.",1301356800,,673,4.184615384615385
3774405,5,B001R8I31W,"I put the DVD in the car's dvd player and in two weeks I realised my daughet knew her animals. that's an excellent DVD. My daughet is 4 years old ans my son is 2. For both of my kids arabic is a third language after english and french.
The DVD has really good picture and nice songs. My kids laugh when they watch it ao id also fun.",1297555200,2,332,3.8260869565217392
3774406,5,B001R8I31W,"I bought the whole series for my son when he was one ( colors , shapes, numbers and animals) and he still watches them at age 3. They are all very well done and I give credit to those DVDs for teaching my son to love the Arabic language. I suggest to start with animals when they are very young then go on to colors then shapes and numbers. The DVDs get more sophisticated and you can track your Childs development through the series.
The songs are easy to memorize, the graphics are good and from experience it's a great gift item. We are really looking forward to the upcoming alphabet DVD!",1296950400,,592,4.294642857142857
3774407,5,B001R8I31W,"My son loves this, as well as the ""Colors"" video.  My husband's first language is Arabic but I only know a handful of works. My husband travels a lot, so our son has very limited exposure to Arabic. I can't say that my son has learned a ton of speaking by watching these, but at least he's getting a little more exposure to it. Animals and Colors seem to be more interesting to him than Shapes. We got them a bit before he turned two and he's almost three and still loves to watch them.",1287792000,5,486,4.11578947368421
3774408,5,B001R8I31W,Very difficult to find quality products of this type in Europe. So was extremely please to have found this & my 3 year old loves the songs and characters.,1263859200,3,154,4.344827586206897
3774409,4,B001R8I31W,"I bought the animal around us CD for my nine months old daughter to teach her the Arabic language. It is good, good quality and nice music and just like the English baby genius movie except i wished that they spoke more Arabic. I still recommend it because there are not many good quality CDs like that. I liked this product and for that i just purchased the color and shapes CDs.",1261958400,,380,4.291666666666667
8337549,5,B001R8I31W,I purchased one and it was not working properly but the return was easy through Amazon. And by mistake I bought 2 of this one originally so we opened the other one and it worked perfectly. Love it and love that it has hal seesan song :)),1489017600,,237,4.0638297872340425
8337550,5,B001R8I31W,great to teach kids arabic,1473811200,,26,4.4
8337551,4,B001R8I31W,"Great for teaching very young children, bought this for 15 month old to watch with her Dad.  He says it's good.",1468540800,,111,4.285714285714286
8337552,5,B001R8I31W,"My baby really really loves this dvd. It's about 20 mins of songs, puppets, and kids talking about animals, in the garden, in the desert, and in the farm. Very educational, and it is the ONLY thing my baby would watch and enjoy, and leaves me to tend to some housework.. :)",1462406400,,273,4.269230769230769

8337554,5,B001R8I31W,my daughter loves this. she sings with it. at first I was iffy but she loved it and learned from it. I speak arabic but not great. this helps to teach the proper arabic. I learned too :),1427241600,,186,3.9210526315789473
8337555,4,B001R8I31W,"It's true, the quality isn't great.  Steady camerawork with the puppets would have helped a lot.  But it is what it is, and it serves its purpose.  It holds my daughter's attention well enough and it exposes her to Arabic.",1395532800,,222,4.5
8337556,4,B001R8I31W,My kids know some Arabic but not a lot so this was a good video.  It repeated simple vocabulary multiple times and had cute pictures and puppets to go with it.  Similar style to a Baby Einstein video.  My kids are ages 3 and 5 so I don't think it would work for kids much older than that but we all watched it together and tried to learn new words that we didn't know before.  This is ideal for kids who are learning Arabic as a second language or for very young kids who hear a lot of Arabic but want to expand vocabulary.,1381104000,,523,4.0
8337557,2,B001R8I31W,",my n gets bored watching this - it is made badly , looks cheap , is a very short DVD and very expensive",1376697600,,104,3.5652173913043477
