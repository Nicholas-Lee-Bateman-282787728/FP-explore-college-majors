8217010,5,B000V78S4M,"""Journey by Heart"" is a short, but fascinating, account of the work being done at Alzheimer's Services of the East Bay, a center that works with adults who have Alzheimers. Rather than presenting the disease as a frightening tragedy, it shows how people in the right environment can still lead dignified and happy lives. The people at the center are loving and creative, and there's a genuine affection for the lucky men and women who come to this place. One hopes that this film is shown everywhere as an example of what can be accomplished to help both those with Alzheimers and their caregivers.",1191024000,3,598,4.759615384615385
