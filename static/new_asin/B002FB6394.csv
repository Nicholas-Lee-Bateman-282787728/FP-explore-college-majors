8368909,5,B002FB6394,Pat Perry's approach to spaniel training will provide the beginner with a step-by-step process. It is clearly demonstrated during an actual training seminar in which experienced as well as less experienced English Springer Spaniels and their owners participated.  The DVD will also be an excellent refresher for owners of experienced dogs wishing to sharpen their dogs' performance in the field by utilizing the techniques and training exercises that are explained and utilized throughout the seminar and are summarized in training notes throughout the program.  The 2 disc set will be a very useful addition to any spaniel owner's training tools.,1247356800,2,647,5.46

I had heard of Pat Perry as an excellent trainer but living in New York City, it is hard to go up to New England to train. This series takes the training fields to your living room.",1247011200,4,278,4.264150943396227
8368912,5,B002FB6394,"After viewing this 2 disc gun dog training video, I was amazed at all the new training and development that I had learned. I was excited to practice the same training with my cocker spaniel. This video has examples of dogs that are beginning training all the way thru a finished gun dog. The key point i picked up while watching the video was the patience that Patrick had for each handler and dog. Practice with both the handler and dog makes perfect. I have a cocker spaniel that just turned 2 and this DVD set was a great learning tool and has been part of our daily routine. The video is very informative with breaks to take notes on key points and examples of real handlers and their dogs. Unlike other training DVD's this has handlers and dogs that make mistakes and Pat is there to guide them on how to fix it. I would highly recommend this DVD to all handlers, trainers, and dog owners.",1246924800,3,894,4.359281437125748
