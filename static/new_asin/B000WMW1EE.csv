2987653,1,B000WMW1EE,"This movie was basically a vehicle for Sammy Petrillo and Duke Mitchell, who were kind of a low-rent Martin & Lewis. Sammy had, in fact, appeared on a Dean & Jerry TV show as Jerry's infant son. He was 17 at the time this movie was made and shamelessly imitates Lewis in it, but he does it very well! He looks amazingly like him and although his voice gets grating when he yells (which he spends a lot of the movie doing), his imitation is first rate.

This movie was obviously knocked off in about a week's time (including writing, no doubt) and made it into theaters despite threats from Jerry Lewis to sue the studio. I think we would have been better off if they DID burn the prints.

BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA is about as good as it sounds. It has a simplistic, not-a-thought-in-its-head story, incredibly unfunny jokes, dull direction, dinner-theatre level performances, and

*SPOILER*

in the end, it all turns out to be a dream!

  If only I could chalk watching this movie up to being a nightmare, we'd all be happy. Absolutely not to be missed under any circumstances.",1225152000,,1089,4.553846153846154
2987654,2,B000WMW1EE,"All the black and white comedy teams have one thing in common, they have all been in movies or shorts with a guy in a gorilla suit; The Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Mitchell and Petrillo, ........ what you have never heard of Mitchell and Petrillo? Then my friend you have been fortunate enough to have never seen ""Bela Legosi meets a Brooklyn Gorilla""! Folks, this movie is bad, bad, bad.

We'll start off with Duke Mitchell. Well he wears his shirt like a flaming homosexual for one, tied in a knot in front like Daisy Duke or something. He is supposed to be the 'straight guy', pardon my pun. He sings somewhat, and is the love interest of the chief's daughter on the island of Kola Kola. Kola Kola by the way is an island somewhere in the Pacific, along a flight route to Guam. But on the island there are lions, girraffes, and many other African animals. Go figure.

Sammy Petrillo cannot be described in one word, it takes several; nincompoop, buffoon, child-like, idiotic, and goofy, but I prefer the word retarded. I can't stand Jerry Lewis, and the only thing worse than Jerry Lewis is a poor, second-rate imitation of Jerry Lewis. I wonder what the French think of Mr. Petrillo? Anyway, he is the love interest of the other chief's daughter, the obese one.

Bela Lugosi comes along for the ride in this inane film. I do not know if it was sepcial effects or bad photography, but all of his bottom teeth look black. Well anyway, 30 years after starring in the movie Dracula, Duke and Sammy think he's Dracula in Bela's very first scene.

The chief's daughter (the hot one) is the eye candy of the flick. She has great legs and shows uite a bit of cleavage.

Probably the most talented cast member of this movie is the chimpanzee. She can open doors, turn keys in locks, and a number of other things.

I would recommend this movie for Halloween night for very young children or the extreme elderly. Anyone above the age of 5 would find very little entertainment value and anyone over the age of 79 is probably too tired to care what is on.",1190592000,,2071,4.480106100795756
2987655,3,B000WMW1EE,"This film is not as bad as the title would make it seem.
Duke Mitchell & Sammy Petrillo are the poor man's Martin and Lewis.
Petrillo's ""humor"" makes Jerry Lewis appear understated in comparison and I'm sure Dino never felt threatened by Duke.
Bela Lugosi turns in his usual credible mad scientist performance.
Charlita plays the love interest and is smokin' HOT, scantily attired in her best South Sea togs.
The video and audio quality are very good as was the print used for the transfer.

2987656,3,B000WMW1EE,"This is a stunning film in both concept an execution. The premise is simple: two talentless hacks...I mean...entertainers, parachute onto a primitive island, Cola-Cola. There they meet crazy natives, beautiful girls, and an evil genius in a castle. Mayhem ensues, comedy erupts, the entertainers sing, the natives dance, and Bela Lugosi turns Duke Mitchell into a gorilla. Nefarious schemes are hatched, romance rears its ugly head, and slapstick is in vogue. Lugosi gets his comeuppance and love conquers all. The end.

Seriously, this film is an absolute abomination. I once heard that Bela Lugosi thought this was his worst film; I can't confirm that, but I can believe it. This is a stunning find, unavailable for a long time, but now available to all camp lovers. The movie is definitely in the ""so bad it's good"" category, and the single worst feature is, without doubt, Sammy Petrillo, the poor man's Jerry Lewis. I personally find Jerry Lewis insufferable, but Petrillo is like a caricature of Lewis: even worse, and infinitely less funny than the original. The French would love this guy.

The standup routine and songs are especially noxious. I would have given this film five stars as a perfect camp classic, were it not for the two star penalty (one each for Mitchell and Petrillo) for the ""live entertainment"" performed within the film. You have to be pretty hardened to be able to tolerate Petrillo, especially when his partner turns into a gorilla leaving him an even higher percentage of the lines. Adding a predictable twist, Mitchell (the Dean Martin wannabe) romances the pretty islander, Nona, which leaves the morbidly obese island girl to chase stick-like Petrillo about, finally driving him into the clutches of a chimpanzee. Meanwhile Dr. Zabor (Lugosi at his most crazed) is doing evolutionary experiments and wants to stop the budding romance between Nona and Mitchell. I was grateful that he transformed Mitchell, as it stopped all the singing (for a while anyway.) In a dramatic finale, all subplots are resolved and we are able to contemplate those 74 minutes of our lives which we'll never get back.

This movie is a grade-Z cheesefest, and I recommend it to all lovers of tacky, stupid camp films; just be advised that Sammy Petrillo may be the most annoying man in show business. With that admonition in mind, enjoy the cheese.",1171152000,,2359,4.982233502538071

2987660,2,B000WMW1EE,"And the award for Most Annoying Actor in the History of the Universe goes to ... Sammy Petrillo for his shamelessly bad impersonation of Jerry Lewis in Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. About the only thing this film accomplishes is to prove that Jerry Lewis was a comic genius. Lewis was funny, but Sammy Petrillo doing the same shtick is dreadful. Duke Mitchell isn't exactly Dean Martin, either. Petrillo's first line in this film is ""Ah lady, you got us mixed up with two other guys!"" Wrong. Try as they might, these guys are a painfully bad substitute for Lewis and Martin. Lewis apparently threatened some sort of legal action over this bomb, thereby helping ensure that Duke and Sammy never made another movie. Jerry, you have our eternal gratitude.

The only reason anyone should contemplate watching this movie is for Bela Lugosi alone. Lugosi is one of my favorite actors, but there's no denying the fact that he hit rock bottom in his later years. Just out of rehab and desperate for work, he had little choice but to take on roles such as that of Dr. Zabor - especially when the filmmakers promised to put his name in the film's title. Sadly, he would soon have one foot in the grave and the other on the rotten banana peel that is Ed Wood. I think he's pretty good in this film, but he really has nothing to work with here. William ""One Shot"" Beaudine didn't earn his nickname by directing theatrical masterpieces. Charlita isn't bad as Nona, aka the poor man's Dorothy Lamour, but the only genuinely impressive performance in the entire movie is that of a chimpanzee.

So what's the story here? Well, Duke and Sammy are on their way to play for the troops in Guam when they fall out of the airplane and land in a jungle paradise (the island of ""Kola-Kola""). A tribe of extremely white natives finds them and, unfortunately, do not go along with their Bird Man's advice to kill them. Nona, the chief's educated daughter, takes quite a shine to Duke, and that doesn't sit well with her mad scientist employer Dr. Zabor, who lusts for young Nona himself (and who can blame him, what with all those revealing outfits she wears?). I won't bore you with all the silly details, but the upshot is that Dr. Zabor turns Duke into a gorilla. Then, just when you think the movie can't get any more ridiculous, it does.

This whole film boils down to Sammy Petrillo spewing out one-liners left and right, seemingly oblivious to the fact that nothing he says or does is remotely funny.",1128124800,,2489,4.5887640449438205
2987661,1,B000WMW1EE,"I'll admit to a fondness for bad movies.  Call it my inner Tom Servo, but I enjoy watching really hopeless films and pointing out all the places where the filmmakers blundered.  And if there's one thing I've learned in watching bad movies it's that there is nothing worse than a film that's simply boring.  And if there is one thing that's worse than that, it's a comedy film that isn't funny.

BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA manages to capture both of those dubious honors without breaking a sweat.  This is a wretched movie with absolutely nothing to recommend about it.  It's film prints exists purely to use up atoms that could be of better use as food for starving children, as gold to bring developing nations up out of poverty, or, to set our sites somewhat lower, as prints of better movies where the human actors aren't actually out-acted by a trained monkey.  (To be fair, the trained monkey in this film is rather adorable.)

First of all, let's begin with a look at the main cast.  The ""comedy"" duo which stars this film are Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, who are a blatant rip-off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.  And when I say ""blatant rip-off"" I mean that (according to legend) Sammy Petrillo was ordered to refrain from future performances as this character under threat of legal action from Jerry Lewis.

And you can understand where Lewis was coming from.  I mean, Jerry Lewis' standard character was more annoying than an eight-year-old on crack, but this guy is Jerry Lewis turned up to 11.  He's so mind-alteringly aggravating that I can only imagine that he had to hold off a lynching from his fellow cast-members with a well loaded machine-gun.

He's whiny.  He's annoying.  He hops and skips and warbles his way through the film.  He's awful, really.  He makes me want to revise my opinions on capital punishment.

He, incredibly, is actually the most entertaining thing about the movie.  And he's horrific.

See, the problem is this.  If you're making a comedy movie (and if you're giving your film the title of ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla"", you damn well better be making a comedy), then you really need to put some jokes in it.  I'm not asking for much.  Good jokes, bad jokes, corny jokes, silly jokes.  Anything will do.  But, really, virtually all of the jokes fall under the jurisdiction of the Sammy Petrillo character.  Everyone else is in a sort of holding pattern waiting for the jokes to fall from the typewriter of the writer.

But the jokes never came.

And we all grew weary and sad.

But now we must turn our attention onto the eponymous Bela Lugosi.  Oh, the poor man.  I have no idea what he was doing in this film, and judging from his performance, neither does he.  He deserved better than this.

I haven't mentioned the plot yet, because the film barely has one.  Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo fall out of a plane (yeah) and land on an island somewhere in a Pacific Ocean populated by a bunch of white looking ""natives"".  The production of the jungle doesn't look half bad, but the extras are clad in very cheap fake animal skins and in at least one scene I believe these primitive people are actually wearing Hawaiian shirts in an attempt to look native.

Anyway, the plot, as I was saying, involves these two dopes on a primitive island.  Also on the island are the obligatory love interest (a native girl), the obligatory love interest's father (the chief of the village), and a mad scientist who is supposed the ""only white man on the island"" (a statement true only if you discount everyone else living on the island).  Oh, and the comic relief comes in the form of the love interest's enormous sister who for some reason falls in lust with Sammy Petrillo.  (Two problems with this.  First of all, if you're making a comedy film and your script requires an obvious comic relief, then the story isn't as funny as it needs to be.  Second, no, the large sister isn't the most attractive woman on the island, but, hey, Sammy Petrillo is the most annoying man on the planet.  Where does he get off turning away anyone's advances?)

You see, the story revolves around Duke Mitchell being in love with the Chief's daughter.  The mad scientist (you didn't need me to tell you this is the Bela Lugosi role), apart from being mad, is also in love with the same girl.  And since he runs experiments on evolution (you're hearing Darwin on spin-dry) you just know we're in for some ""hilarious"" hijinks involving monkeys.  Or people in unconvincing gorilla suits.

The actual trained monkey is arguably the best thing about this movie.  And my understanding is that he actually is the same chimp who appeared in much better movies of the era, so if you're a big fan of the monkey you can see him in something else better.

Don't be fooled into thinking this might be a wonderfully fun, camp bad movie.  This is a horribly annoying awful film and no one should waste their time watching this in hope of finding even some unintentional laughs.  Avoid at all costs.",1120953600,,5020,4.608352144469526
2987662,3,B000WMW1EE,"Don't be fooled by the stupid title. This is an amusing, efficient B comedy of 1952 starring the young nightclub comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo. If you like Martin & Lewis, The Bowery Boys, or Abbott & Costello, you've come to the right place, because the stars impersonate Martin & Lewis; the director, writers, and leading lady were moonlighting from the Bowery Boys series; and the cameraman and editor worked on Abbott & Costello pictures. This silly jungle comedy is no worse (and sometimes better) than a 1950s effort from those higher-budgeted comedians.

The 69-year-old Bela Lugosi is an excellent comic foil, and even plays romantic scenes persuasively. The playful Petrillo improvises to confound Lugosi, but Lugosi -- ever the professional -- never loses command of the scene. The crew gets the maximum value from the budget, with good photography and musical score, and here's a small mark of authenticity, as jungle movies go: ""Ramona the Chimp"" is really Cheeta of the Tarzan series.

Digiview's DVD edition is an extraordinary value. Picture and sound quality compare favorably to the premium laserdisc editions; the Realart logo is missing from this DVD, but everything else is here.",1119571200,,1212,5.178571428571429

""That chimp is the best actor in the flick!""

The chimp performed complex comic actions, room-to-room walkthrus, and used perfect timing. Much of it in long, uncut sequences. The chimp never missed a beat and always ""hit his mark.' Let me tell you,  I almost thought it was an human in a suit, if not an inserted, contemporary CGI character.

But nope, it was a real chimp - none other than CHEETA, of Tarzan movie fame (portraying ""in drag"" as ""Ramona"" - like Lassie did, I guess, and billed with a screen alias - maybe it was a legal thing).

And get this - Cheeta is ALIVE and turns 74 this year. He's the oldest chimp on record and mentioned for it in Guinesses. Moveover, he's happily living in Palm Springs at the Cheeta Primate Sanctuary, Inc, with the nephew of his original trainer!

He looks amazingly like him and although his voice gets grating when he yells (which he spends a lot of the movie doing), his imitation is first rate.

This movie was obviously knocked off in about a week's time (including writing, no doubt) and made it into theaters despite threats from Jerry Lewis to sue the studio. I think we would have been better off if they DID burn the prints.

BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA is about as good as it sounds. It has a simplistic, not-a-thought-in-its-head story, incredibly unfunny jokes, dull direction, dinner-theatre level performances, and

*SPOILER*

in the end, it all turns out to be a dream!

  If only I could chalk watching this movie up to being a nightmare, we'd all be happy. Absolutely not to be missed under any circumstances.",1225152000,,1089,4.553846153846154

Then my friend you have been fortunate enough to have never seen ""Bela Legosi meets a Brooklyn Gorilla""! Folks, this movie is bad, bad, bad.

We'll start off with Duke Mitchell. Well he wears his shirt like a flaming homosexual for one, tied in a knot in front like Daisy Duke or something. He is supposed to be the 'straight guy', pardon my pun. He sings somewhat, and is the love interest of the chief's daughter on the island of Kola Kola. Kola Kola by the way is an island somewhere in the Pacific, along a flight route to Guam. But on the island there are lions, girraffes, and many other African animals. Go figure.

Sammy Petrillo cannot be described in one word, it takes several; nincompoop, buffoon, child-like, idiotic, and goofy, but I prefer the word retarded. I can't stand Jerry Lewis, and the only thing worse than Jerry Lewis is a poor, second-rate imitation of Jerry Lewis. I wonder what the French think of Mr. Petrillo? Anyway, he is the love interest of the other chief's daughter, the obese one.

Bela Lugosi comes along for the ride in this inane film. I do not know if it was sepcial effects or bad photography, but all of his bottom teeth look black. Well anyway, 30 years after starring in the movie Dracula, Duke and Sammy think he's Dracula in Bela's very first scene.

The chief's daughter (the hot one) is the eye candy of the flick. She has great legs and shows uite a bit of cleavage.

Probably the most talented cast member of this movie is the chimpanzee. She can open doors, turn keys in locks, and a number of other things.

I would recommend this movie for Halloween night for very young children or the extreme elderly. Anyone above the age of 5 would find very little entertainment value and anyone over the age of 79 is probably too tired to care what is on.",1190592000,,2071,4.480106100795756

3222153,3,B000WMW1EE,"This is a stunning film in both concept an execution. The premise is simple: two talentless hacks...I mean...entertainers, parachute onto a primitive island, Cola-Cola. There they meet crazy natives, beautiful girls, and an evil genius in a castle. Mayhem ensues, comedy erupts, the entertainers sing, the natives dance, and Bela Lugosi turns Duke Mitchell into a gorilla. Nefarious schemes are hatched, romance rears its ugly head, and slapstick is in vogue. Lugosi gets his comeuppance and love conquers all. The end.

Seriously, this film is an absolute abomination. I once heard that Bela Lugosi thought this was his worst film; I can't confirm that, but I can believe it. This is a stunning find, unavailable for a long time, but now available to all camp lovers. The movie is definitely in the ""so bad it's good"" category, and the single worst feature is, without doubt, Sammy Petrillo, the poor man's Jerry Lewis. I personally find Jerry Lewis insufferable, but Petrillo is like a caricature of Lewis: even worse, and infinitely less funny than the original. The French would love this guy.

The standup routine and songs are especially noxious. I would have given this film five stars as a perfect camp classic, were it not for the two star penalty (one each for Mitchell and Petrillo) for the ""live entertainment"" performed within the film. You have to be pretty hardened to be able to tolerate Petrillo, especially when his partner turns into a gorilla leaving him an even higher percentage of the lines. Adding a predictable twist, Mitchell (the Dean Martin wannabe) romances the pretty islander, Nona, which leaves the morbidly obese island girl to chase stick-like Petrillo about, finally driving him into the clutches of a chimpanzee. Meanwhile Dr. Zabor (Lugosi at his most crazed) is doing evolutionary experiments and wants to stop the budding romance between Nona and Mitchell. I was grateful that he transformed Mitchell, as it stopped all the singing (for a while anyway.) In a dramatic finale, all subplots are resolved and we are able to contemplate those 74 minutes of our lives which we'll never get back.

This movie is a grade-Z cheesefest, and I recommend it to all lovers of tacky, stupid camp films; just be advised that Sammy Petrillo may be the most annoying man in show business. With that admonition in mind, enjoy the cheese.",1171152000,,2359,4.982233502538071

About the only thing this film accomplishes is to prove that Jerry Lewis was a comic genius. Lewis was funny, but Sammy Petrillo doing the same shtick is dreadful. Duke Mitchell isn't exactly Dean Martin, either. Petrillo's first line in this film is ""Ah lady, you got us mixed up with two other guys!"" Wrong.

The only reason anyone should contemplate watching this movie is for Bela Lugosi alone. Lugosi is one of my favorite actors, but there's no denying the fact that he hit rock bottom in his later years.

A tribe of extremely white natives finds them and, unfortunately, do not go along with their Bird Man's advice to kill them. Nona, the chief's educated daughter, takes quite a shine to Duke, and that doesn't sit well with her mad scientist employer Dr. Zabor, who lusts for young Nona himself (and who can blame him, what with all those revealing outfits she wears?). I won't bore you with all the silly details, but the upshot is that Dr. Zabor turns Duke into a gorilla. Then, just when you think the movie can't get any more ridiculous, it does.

3222158,1,B000WMW1EE,"I'll admit to a fondness for bad movies.  Call it my inner Tom Servo, but I enjoy watching really hopeless films and pointing out all the places where the filmmakers blundered.  And if there's one thing I've learned in watching bad movies it's that there is nothing worse than a film that's simply boring.  And if there is one thing that's worse than that, it's a comedy film that isn't funny.

BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA manages to capture both of those dubious honors without breaking a sweat.  This is a wretched movie with absolutely nothing to recommend about it.  It's film prints exists purely to use up atoms that could be of better use as food for starving children, as gold to bring developing nations up out of poverty, or, to set our sites somewhat lower, as prints of better movies where the human actors aren't actually out-acted by a trained monkey.  (To be fair, the trained monkey in this film is rather adorable.)

First of all, let's begin with a look at the main cast.  The ""comedy"" duo which stars this film are Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, who are a blatant rip-off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.  And when I say ""blatant rip-off"" I mean that (according to legend) Sammy Petrillo was ordered to refrain from future performances as this character under threat of legal action from Jerry Lewis.

And you can understand where Lewis was coming from.  I mean, Jerry Lewis' standard character was more annoying than an eight-year-old on crack, but this guy is Jerry Lewis turned up to 11.  He's so mind-alteringly aggravating that I can only imagine that he had to hold off a lynching from his fellow cast-members with a well loaded machine-gun.

He's whiny.  He's annoying.  He hops and skips and warbles his way through the film.  He's awful, really.  He makes me want to revise my opinions on capital punishment.

He, incredibly, is actually the most entertaining thing about the movie.  And he's horrific.

See, the problem is this.  If you're making a comedy movie (and if you're giving your film the title of ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla"", you damn well better be making a comedy), then you really need to put some jokes in it.  I'm not asking for much.  Good jokes, bad jokes, corny jokes, silly jokes.  Anything will do.  But, really, virtually all of the jokes fall under the jurisdiction of the Sammy Petrillo character.  Everyone else is in a sort of holding pattern waiting for the jokes to fall from the typewriter of the writer.

But the jokes never came.

And we all grew weary and sad.

But now we must turn our attention onto the eponymous Bela Lugosi.  Oh, the poor man.  I have no idea what he was doing in this film, and judging from his performance, neither does he.  He deserved better than this.

I haven't mentioned the plot yet, because the film barely has one.  Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo fall out of a plane (yeah) and land on an island somewhere in a Pacific Ocean populated by a bunch of white looking ""natives"".  The production of the jungle doesn't look half bad, but the extras are clad in very cheap fake animal skins and in at least one scene I believe these primitive people are actually wearing Hawaiian shirts in an attempt to look native.

Anyway, the plot, as I was saying, involves these two dopes on a primitive island.  Also on the island are the obligatory love interest (a native girl), the obligatory love interest's father (the chief of the village), and a mad scientist who is supposed the ""only white man on the island"" (a statement true only if you discount everyone else living on the island).  Oh, and the comic relief comes in the form of the love interest's enormous sister who for some reason falls in lust with Sammy Petrillo.  (Two problems with this.  First of all, if you're making a comedy film and your script requires an obvious comic relief, then the story isn't as funny as it needs to be.  Second, no, the large sister isn't the most attractive woman on the island, but, hey, Sammy Petrillo is the most annoying man on the planet.  Where does he get off turning away anyone's advances?)

You see, the story revolves around Duke Mitchell being in love with the Chief's daughter.  The mad scientist (you didn't need me to tell you this is the Bela Lugosi role), apart from being mad, is also in love with the same girl.  And since he runs experiments on evolution (you're hearing Darwin on spin-dry) you just know we're in for some ""hilarious"" hijinks involving monkeys.  Or people in unconvincing gorilla suits.

The actual trained monkey is arguably the best thing about this movie.  And my understanding is that he actually is the same chimp who appeared in much better movies of the era, so if you're a big fan of the monkey you can see him in something else better.

Don't be fooled into thinking this might be a wonderfully fun, camp bad movie.  This is a horribly annoying awful film and no one should waste their time watching this in hope of finding even some unintentional laughs.  Avoid at all costs.",1120953600,,5020,4.608352144469526
3222159,3,B000WMW1EE,"Don't be fooled by the stupid title. This is an amusing, efficient B comedy of 1952 starring the young nightclub comedians Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo. If you like Martin & Lewis, The Bowery Boys, or Abbott & Costello, you've come to the right place, because the stars impersonate Martin & Lewis; the director, writers, and leading lady were moonlighting from the Bowery Boys series; and the cameraman and editor worked on Abbott & Costello pictures. This silly jungle comedy is no worse (and sometimes better) than a 1950s effort from those higher-budgeted comedians.

The 69-year-old Bela Lugosi is an excellent comic foil, and even plays romantic scenes persuasively. The playful Petrillo improvises to confound Lugosi, but Lugosi -- ever the professional -- never loses command of the scene. The crew gets the maximum value from the budget, with good photography and musical score, and here's a small mark of authenticity, as jungle movies go: ""Ramona the Chimp"" is really Cheeta of the Tarzan series.

good movie. It's funny and charming and Bela Lugosi gives a excellent performance even though it's not The Raven or Dracula! The two guys
who star in this are Martin and Lewis clones but they are pretty good especially the Lewis guy! the Martin guy is so hilarious when he sings and
nobody can take him seriously and I wonder if HE took himself seriously as a singer! It's one of the funniest moments of the movie. Lugosi is in
most of the picture which makes it better than some where he just has a cameo. This movie is also better than some of Martin and Lewis movies
maybe all of them! This one has Bela Lugosi and theirs don't! So If your a Lugosi or horror mystery comedy B movie fan you will love this one.",1430697600,,858,4.206060606060606

8224310,2,B000WMW1EE,I would not recommend this movie for everyone only because it's one of those sometimes nostalgia pieces from the 50s but the two main characters gave me a few chuckles.. And of course seeing Bella Lugosi school who played Dracula in the 1930 s film by the same name is worth the price of the dvd by itself in my opinion.,1400544000,,320,4.262295081967213
8224311,3,B000WMW1EE,"I hafta admit, this movie, when I saw it on the Turner Classic Movie Channel, was dopey and predictable,..but,...one thing that surprised me were the two primary protagonists in the movie, who do a copycat performance of Jerry and Dino. The guy who imitates Dino's character, only vaguely looks like Dino, and does not sing quite like Dino. But the guy who imitates Jerry Lewis' character in this movie is a Dead Ringer for young Jerry Lewis. Looks exactly like him. Mugs exactly like him, and even laughs like him. If you didn't know better, you might think it IS Jerry Lewis. That is why I bought the movie. The whole movie is a spoof on Jerry and Dino, and the cheesy Musical/Horror/Suspense type movies of the genre. How they made this movie, without being sued by the REAL Jerry and Dean, is beyond me. I put it in with my Jerry Lewis movies section of my DVD Library.

If you can get this movie for a reasonable price, it's worth a look, for Jerry Lewis Fans.",1376179200,,965,4.451977401129944

8224313,2,B000WMW1EE,"This movie was so bad, I even had a difficult time riffing it. The two night-club actors do a nails-running-across-a chalk-board kind of annoying imitation of Lewis and Martin on an island filled with natives that were whiter then white. The only actors in this film that could actually act were the chimp and Lugosi. This flick makes Ed Wood seem like Spielberg.",1332028800,,363,4.777777777777778

Total schlock comedy that is soooo bad , it's good. If you aren't a little warped yourself you may not like it. Doesn't hurt to be a little high either while watching it. You have to be able to appreciate the bizarre. VERY hard to find item.",1299456000,,383,4.12
8224315,4,B000WMW1EE,"What a pleasant surprise DIGIVIEW's slim-line cased DVD of BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA (1952) is.

The transfer is positively flawless: great sound and a clean, break-free full-sized picture throughout. Of course there's no extras, but who needs some erudite analysis of this simple movie, anyway?

Sammy Petrillo as Jerry Lewis is nothing less than remarkable. No wonder Jerry hated this younger man on sight! The kid had his act down to the tiniest nuance. Especially enjoyable is when Sammy drops the ""la-la-la nice lady"" voice to do a corny stand-up routine in his natural baritone and manner. Just like that (snap) Jerry Lewis vanishes.

Conversely, Duke Mitchell is no Dean Martin, and he clearly knows it. Twice, Mitchell sings in a near-operatic vibrato. The balance of the time he's content to let Sammy carry the load, which the kid does admirably.

Evidence of a 'C' grade budget is everywhere-- in the cheap sets, store-bought wardrobes, jungle animal stock footage and lack of retakes. Example of the latter: once they enter Lugosi's home, Sammy flashes a tiny grin after sarong-clad 'Nona' (Charlita) mentions how brilliant 'Dr. Zabor' is. He matter-of-factly replies, ""Anybody who'd live in a creep joint like this must be a moronic idiot."" Duke glances at him, breaks into a broad smile and Sam responds in kind. These men must like each other. At very least, they're enjoying themselves and so can we, thanks to the inclusion of an imperfect but cute 'take.'

""Brooklyn Gorilla"" is mindless fun. It belongs in the home libraries of Lugosi and Lewis fans alike. This fine-quality dub guarantees you'll never seek a 'better' copy elsewhere. Buy with confidence!",1251244800,,1685,5.068592057761733
8224316,1,B000WMW1EE,"Sammy is often deemed a cult hero for his work in this film. While he is a funny man, he is far from being a hero. He left his wife and four small children in 1969. They came home to find that he had moved back to New York. He did at least leave them with a dollar. I know, I was 7 years old at the time. I'm one of the 4 sons he left. The oldest. Our last names are slightly different as he changed his to try to benefit from the current head of the musicians union at the time; who bore the last name Petrillo (same name as my brothers and I, new spelling).",1242777600,,559,3.7457627118644066
