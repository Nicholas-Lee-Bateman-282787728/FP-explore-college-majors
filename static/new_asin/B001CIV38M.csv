8287901,5,B001CIV38M,I have been a fan of Freddy since I was a kid... Jason.. well.. not so much.. he has made how many movies? 20?.. lol.. its all the same stuff with him.. Freddy does things a different... Freddy vs Jason the first time I seen it was a little confusing... lol.. it would go from one hellish nightmare to the next... but after seeing it a second time.. yes yes.. it was overall pretty good!... The only Jason I ever liked was Jason X... Jason becomes some unstoppable robot monster!.. now thats thinking a little.. lol.. but then there was another Jason after that which came Freddy vs Jason... (He wasn't a robot in this movie) Kidda took the fun out of Jason X.. but if your lookin for a nice scare night with some humor.. well here ya go!,1226793600,,738,4.2785714285714285
