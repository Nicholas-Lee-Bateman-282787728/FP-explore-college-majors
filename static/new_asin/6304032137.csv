7862254,3,6304032137,"This was part of a collection for our son.  The condition was acceptable, and was shipped in a timely fashion.  It is a great way to add to collections, without having to spend a lot of money.",1375315200,,192,4.162162162162162
7862255,5,6304032137,"Contains ""The Law of the Jungle"" (from ep. 10), ""Uganda Be an Elephant"" (from ep. 5) and ""Be More Pacific"" (from ep. 11).

This is the fifth volume in the series. The Editorial Reviews is incorrect and is actually the content from Vol. 2: Grub's On. But despite that I recommend this.",1346112000,,284,4.461538461538462
