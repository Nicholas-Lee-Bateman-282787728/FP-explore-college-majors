4310817,3,B004AR4WE4,"My 2 year old daughter loves Calliou so I bought this DVD along with two others. There are too many ads from PBS and not enough of the actual Calliou show. I have to fast forward ALOT.

4310818,5,B004AR4WE4,"My two-year-old loves the video and we are thrilled with the pace of the action. I often worry that other shows move too fast and may lead to attention problems. Actually, I read research recently comparing Caillou to Sponge Bob and this was verified.
The themes for different family vacations helps our little one understand going to simple places such as beach or camping for vacation. We are non-traditional family but all families can relate to the themes of Caillou.",1318204800,12,471,4.9

4310872,2,B004AR4WE4,Grandkids are 1 1/2 and 4 and they will both watch it over and over. I like it because it teaches as well as entertains,1389398400,,119,3.8
4310873,3,B004AR4WE4,"There are Puppets who pose as Teddy, Gilbert and the dinosaur. It's bizarre and distracting.
There are chucky cheese announcements and random children songs; if I wanted ""commercials"" then I wouldn't have purchased a dvd.
I would assume dvd's of a show come without interruptions-I can't figure out how to fast forward them either; they just take you to the next set of puppets. ugh. My daughte loves Calliou so much that she just says ""what happened, who's that"" every time the puppets come on.",1388966400,,495,4.8352941176470585

4310878,3,B004AR4WE4,My main problem with this DVD is that they have the stuffed animals talking between shows. I don't understand the reasoning behind this and I feel like it was a waste of time. They could have used that extra time for more shows.,1378512000,,228,4.325581395348837
4310879,5,B004AR4WE4,NOT!  Just kidding.  If you haven't seen anything Caillou think Sesame Street without all the furry puppets.  My 3 yr old granddaughter is obsessed with Caillou so she was a happy camper to unwrap this little DVD.  The last 2 Caillou DVDs were well received and have been watched over and over and over.,1378512000,,303,4.555555555555555

They play a 4 minute episode, then creepy puppets, then kids singing annoying songs, then another 4 minute episode and so on....  Please, save your money! The 7 dollar DVD is not worth trying to console an inconsolable toddler due to unexpected puppets.",1375488000,,370,4.522388059701493

4310890,1,B004AR4WE4,Seriously do not waste your money for a dvd that puts a commercial every 3 minutes! The show was only a 3-4 minute episode and it would go to a 3 minute commercial!,1373414400,,164,4.0

Well I was mislead, 3 of the 4, 30 minute sets are the old version and we have to do alot of fast forwarding to keep those puppets away, and it does not fast forward like a regular DVD it skips like 30 second blocks, kind of strange!!",1339545600,35,467,3.9263157894736844
4310904,1,B004AR4WE4,"This is not episodes of Caillou as seen on TV. It has random puppets -- non cartoon - in there too for long periods. Also, and more importantly, it TOTALLY duplicates a DVD I have gotten previously from Amazon. Normally a DVD will be of ""new"" episodes or note otherwise. We were very disappointed. And I could NOT tell from the description on Amazon that the episodes would be the exactly the same as included on other DVDs. I have repeatedly ordered DVDs of series and have never had this problem.",1332633600,7,498,4.483516483516484

4310911,4,B004AR4WE4,This is a good dvd for any Caillou lover. I bought this off amazon for my 3 yr old son after not being able to find any Caillou dvds in the stores. There is about 4 or 5 different little episodes. The only reason I rated it a 4 & no a 5 is that there is a few little commericals & some other little cat puppet that comes on b/t episodes. Maybe this is a plus so it looks like they are on tv.,1325376000,,391,3.611764705882353
