A woman receives an envelope for Christmas from a man. Afterwards this man uses his shotgun. Later a group of swimmers find the body of that woman! The police find that woman's wallet in the possession of a homeless man living in a storm drain. Case solved? Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested. Miss Kathleen Riley is his Public Defender. They start off on the wrong foot. The accused is ""deaf and dumb""! Two politicians discuss a farm bill in Washington. Its not easy for Miss Riley to converse with her client. He describes ""Michael"" who found the body. Can she find this man with a private investigator? Miss Riley examines the jurors. Mr. Sanger is a lobbyist. The private investigator finds the man described, but he escapes. The trial goes on.

The Prosecutor does his job against Anderson. [Why was nobody around at this parking lot?] Anderson suffered from contracting meningitis at a VA hospital and became handicapped. The pathologist waffles on a point of evidence. Is the judge biased against Riley? Juror Sanger talks to a Parking Lot attendant. Then he talks to a homeless woman about an identification pin. [Would such actions get him into trouble in the real world even if he was not a juror?] There is drama from a sudden attack at the Union railway station. [Believable at a busy public place?] Anderson writes he is ""innocent"". Riley and Sanger meet again. The Judge threatens Riley over meeting Sanger. Sanger has an idea where that pin came from. They find the body of another murder victim. Will this affect the trial? They find the lock for that key in a Justice Department locker. [Could strangers gain access to this building?]

Riley and Sanger meet in a library. The trial judge arrives. They use a computer with a light pen to let Anderson testify in court. This brings out his past actions. In the rainy night someone breaks into a car in a parking lot and takes a tape cassette. [Would someone really put a confession on a tape cassette?] A fire alarm goes off in a building. Riley goes to a courthouse for research. Who is following her? Kathleen marks his arm. The next day there are conflicts in the courtroom! Will the guilty person be identified as ""red handed""? Will the defendant be cleared when Riley accuses the real murderer? [Do you find this ending believable?]

It is a good story except for a plot that could have had a better ending. The 1963 novel ""The Seventh Juror"" had a similar plot. A better writer and script would create a better story. This was made just after the ""Contragate"" scandal when the Reagan-Bush administration was enabling drug smuggling into the USA. The details are in the book ""Compromised"" by Terry Reed. Who was the Governor of Arkansas then? Senators approve all Federal judges. Can this power be used to affect trials?",1393200000,,2807,4.722448979591837
