8708204,4,B00USQR9AU,"The disc is an important and very welcome addition to the operatic canon available on blu ray and dvd.  For many years the only LP recording available was a pirated Radio Torino performance, and now we have the first video production, from Palermo's Teatro Massimo----one can only say: bravo Italy!

The musical performance adequately (but not more) captures the first flowering (after Guntram's Wagnerian excesses) of Strauss's operatic genius: wonderful orchestration, a unique musical voice, and a soaring soprano line.  I'm less happy with the production: the director appears to have transported the action from medieval Munich (which appropriately fits with the plot line of both Strauss's and his ""Meister"", Wagner's, having early in their careers been knocked about by the critics and audiences of that city) to a 1940s/50s Palermo tenement to which is added a strange mix of Fellini-esque  fantasy and Italian cinematic neo-realism.  Too often, too much stage business distracts from the music and at times the story.  Indeed, some viewers will want to skip the first 10-plus minutes of the disc entirely and begin watching from the conductor's initial downbeat.  I was lucky to have seen in 1980 two performances of a production at the Bavarian State Opera, which was set in a believably medieval Munich and played the story straight, without choreography, and with the fear inspired in provincial folk by the magician Kunrad entirely believable.  It would be  nice to have such a version available to us.  Having said that, one is thankful to have this one.",1468368000,4,1568,5.16205533596838

8708206,3,B00USQR9AU,"For devotees of Richard Strauss operas, this fills a gap.  The production is not perverse, and the performance satisfactory.  It is easy to see, however, why the piece is not often done.  It seems to have been willed into being rather than imagined or inspired.",1443052800,3,261,4.7555555555555555
8708207,4,B00USQR9AU,"History hasn't been kind to Richard Strauss's first two operas Guntram (1894) and Feuersnot (1901), both of them better known now by reputation than through actual performance. It's common knowledge that the influence of Wagner was still very present in Strauss's early operas, slavishly so in Guntram, self-consciously in Feuersnot. Not that you would have had much of an opportunity to reevaluate these early operas. One welcome exception, thankfully recorded and preserved for release on Blu-ray, is the rare staging of Feuersnot at the Teatro Massino in Palermo in 2014. Directed by Emma Dante and conducted by Gabriele Ferro, it's a thoughtful and entertaining production that plays to the strengths of the work and overcomes many of the problems that prevent it being staged more often.

The main problem with staging Feuersnot, I imagine, is that it's hard to know quite how to pitch Strauss's undoubtedly self-indulgent attempt at parody in the work, and actually make it entertaining. Strauss isn't exactly obscure about his intentions in how he sets himself up as the successor to Wagner writing his own version of Die Meistersinger von Nrnburg, and presenting himself, in the guise of Kunrad, as something of a stud into the bargain. Musically, he makes a more persuasive case, taking Wagner's mystic spiritualism and giving it a more earthy sensuality.  It could be considered vulgar, but this is entirely in keeping with other Strauss works of this time (Ein Heldenleben in 1898 and Symphonia Domestica in 1903) that would elevate the personal and the domestic to grandiose levels. Or simply find them subjects more worthy and relevant to the present day.

The 'legend' of Feuersnot is a thin one, even for a one-act opera (a 'Singgedicht in one act'), with little dramatic drive. Emma Dante however recognises that it's about music and not magic, and brings that not terribly well concealed subtext out in a number of ways. She also attempts to capture the huge variety and dynamic that lies within the score and represent that on the stage with circus acts and dancers to give an impression of constant colour and movement. This can be entertaining and sometimes annoying, but it does certainly bring some liveliness and a certain tongue-in-cheek irreverence that adds to the tone and enlivens a staging of work. The final 'fire dance' scene in particular more than justifies the approach, finding a colourful and meaningful way to represent the otherwise problematic ending.

The musical performances all contribute to making this an 'illuminating' production of a rare Strauss opera. Gabriele Ferro underplays the Wagner and emphasises more of the familiar later Strauss characteristics in the score. Nicola Beller Carbone has Wagnerian strength aplenty in the role of Diemut, and although Dietrich Henschel doesn't quite have the force or the volume for a heldenbaritone he sings and plays the role of Kunrad with a mischievous sparkle and verve. None of this is perhaps enough to see Feuersnot reconsidered as canonical Strauss, but it is unquestionably Strauss, and presented in the best possible light here.

The 2014 Teatro Massimo production of Feuersnot is released on Bluray by Arthaus, and it looks and sounds terrific in High Definition. The BD has a 12-minute 'Making Of' that gives some insights into the work and the approach to it, and there is also an informative essay on the work in the enclosed booklet. The disc is region-free, but subtitles are in English, German and Korean only.",1435276800,15,3517,5.120209059233449
