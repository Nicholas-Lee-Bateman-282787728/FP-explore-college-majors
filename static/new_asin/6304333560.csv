849071,5,6304333560,"I last saw Ultraman on television when I was five years old in 1970.  His heroism and commitment remained etched only in my memory until I stumbled across this video. What wonderful memories flooded my mind as I traveled  back in time to my innocent childhood and relived the wonder and  excitement. An must-have for any original Ultraman fan. VOLUME 2, PLEASE!",961891200,5,361,4.790322580645161
849072,5,6304333560,"Any fan of the original Ultraman television series (1966) should treasure this collection of the first four episodes.  Just listening to the opening music and watching the first scenes brought back wonderful childhood  memories.  I even remember some of the dialogue and many of the specific  scenes from the multiple times I watched the syndicated series as a child.  Don't purchase this tape if you are looking for first-rate special effects;  part of the joy of watching these episodes is to be charmed by the  ""primitive"" audio and visual effects.  I've searched the internet  for additional episodes and have yet to find more from a reputable company.  To the video's producers - Expressions in Animation and Tsuburaya  Productions - please release more of the original series' 39 episodes.  This collection of episodes is a pop culture gem.",956707200,19,846,5.094890510948905

849074,5,6304333560,"Of all the Television shows I watched when I was growing up, ULTRAMAN is far and away my favorite. I started out with Godzilla but when I discovered Ultraman I knew I'd found something special. This video release of the  first four classic episodes of the 1966 Japanese import is a true treasure  as I haven't seen the seies run on television in years. My only compaint of  this video, other than a somewhat sub-standard audio track, is that it only  contains 4 episodes. Where is volume 2?",951436800,13,490,4.534090909090909
849075,5,6304333560,"Just about everybody in the US and Canada have now heard of Godzilla.  Most people, however, have never heard of the Japanese super-hero that is as popular there as Superman is here.  That monster-fighting hero, created by the special effects studio that first brought the irradiated lizard to the world, is Ultraman!
This tape brings the first 4 episodes of the original Ultraman back to American viewers.  Dubbed in English, these shows were syndicated in the late 60's in America. This tape restores the classic episodes to better-than-original quality. As a bonus, the tape includes an interview with one of the actors in the rubber monster suits, plus the original Japanese intro music.
Anyone who remembers lifting a stick as a play ""Beta capsule"" will want a copy of this collection.  END",899856000,10,795,5.0
7868565,5,6304333560,"I also watched all 39 episodes of the original Ultraman TV series as a child of 2 and being an Ultraman fan, I enjoyed watching Ultraman defeat the evil monsters who meant to do the city of Tokyo and other parts of Japan great harm.

Since I have copies of the original series on both video and DVD (I purchased them on eBay - I did not record the episodes myself), I watch them whenever I get the chance and it allows me a chance to relive that particular time in my life once again.

Today, at the age of 41, I still get a kick out of watching Ultraman beat the monsters who try to get in his way.  GO ULTRAMAN!!!",1142985600,2,615,4.024590163934426
7868566,5,6304333560,"I watched all of the original Ultraman episodes back in 1966;at the tender age of 5,this really made a definitive impression on my mind,turning me into the horror,sci-fi,metal and hardcore punk consumer grown up (43 and counting) I am today. The picture is nearly perfect (remarkably well remastered) but I had to work hard at the sound in order to make it listenable,but hey,remember that was 1966. The first four episodes compiled onto this 2 hours tape are not the best of the series (further ones would feature much better special effects and production) but are enough to make a fan cry from emotion. Plus I got it for U$ 5.50 !!",1110240000,4,634,4.669642857142857
7868567,5,6304333560,This is the real Japanese hero he is to Japan what Superman is for us in America. When I heard the music it brought back memories when I was a kid. When I saw the first episode I remembered almost every dialoge this is incredible. This is a must for every Ultraman fan. He started all the next series like Ultraseven for example. Please release more titles of the original Ultraman on DVD or VHS. I can't wait for the other volumes. Every Sci fi fan must have this video. This is a cult Japanese series.,1026864000,6,503,4.25
7868568,5,6304333560,"This video really brings back some wonderful memories.  I was a kid all over again while viewing these episodes.  I love the special effects(the rubber monsters,etc.)and the fight scenes. The effects were good (considering it was the 1960's.) It is a must have for any Ultra Man or super hero fan.  I just wish that more volumes of the original Ultra Man series would become available for purchase.  I would buy them all!",1013472000,11,421,4.726027397260274
7868569,4,6304333560,"I just remember as a little boy, running home and turning on Ultraman. This video allows me to re-live those ""Good 'ole days"". This video is now a classic, and rare since all the episodes will not be seen in reruns, because they were all shipped back to Japan. A must own for all Ultraman collectors!",1006387200,2,300,4.375
7868570,5,6304333560,"Hayata raises the Beta Capsule, pushes the button, and here comes Ultraman!!  I looked forward to that part of the show every Saturday.  From the lousy special effects, to the corny dialogue, to the familiar background music of the Science Patrol springing into action.  It's all good!!  This was one of my favorite shows as a child and I thought this video was great.  I can't wait for volumes 2, 3 ,4 ....... I used to tape episodes (wish I still had them!) when I was a kid and watch Hayata turn to Ultraman over and over.  If you watched this show as a kid, you owe it to yourself to buy this video!",997315200,5,603,4.245614035087719
7868571,5,6304333560,haven't seen it since I was young can't wait for Volume 2 to come out. Ultraman fans this is a must to get,981676800,,106,3.652173913043478
7868572,5,6304333560,"No high-tech and fancy gadgets, extremely primitive transformation effects, and no computer graphics, but that's exactly what makes this video so special.
For both ""matured"" (and young) Ultraman fans, this  video is a must to complete your collection on the shelf.  It is composed  of the first 4 episodes of the first and original Ultraman series, which  was first shown in Japan back in 1966.  In these episodes you can see how  the original Ultraman came to Earth and the reason for him merging with  Hayata.  In addition you get to see the original rubber monsters, the  original special effects for the Ultrabeam, the original Ultraman's costume  with its zipper... and last but not least, the original, very rough-looking  Ultraman's mask (which apparently, was originally designed such that  Ultraman's mouth can move when he speaks or when he shouts  ""Schwartz"" in his battles, but didn't work too well).  The mask  was soon replaced by a more favorable fixed type with a much smoother  surface, which is the type you see most often nowadays.  All these elements  enable you to relive the memories of the original ultra-hero.
In short,  this is a classic!",963792000,21,1163,4.963541666666667
