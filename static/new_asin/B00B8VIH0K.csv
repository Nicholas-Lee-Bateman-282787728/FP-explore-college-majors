8564281,5,B00B8VIH0K,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this is a worthwhile set for the Superman aficionado, the super hero lover in your family, but they can't call it, or should not have called it, a BEST OF collection.

to be a ""best of"" collection, it should contain the best episodes of each series. Yes the first seasons are often the best, but there are key episodes that are better than the rest. H.G.Wells visits to Lois and Clark are among the best, as is the episode where the angel marries them. There are too many other examples.

If you already have all the series, or you have a friend or library from which to borrow them, you might prefer to binge watch each series when you have time, but if you need to have a good introduction to all the televisions series that have focused on Superman in his various incarnations, then this is an excellent way to go.",1451174400,,853,4.3924050632911396

On the whole it is a fan-boys Superman DVD dream. worth it at any price

One would hope when 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers arrange an agreement,so  Batman the TV show (yes that Adam West show) would be released to DVD..then they can do a BATMAN box like this
