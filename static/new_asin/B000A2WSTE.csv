8681958,4,B000A2WSTE,"Just got this 5 DVD set (purchased here) in the mail and watched PRETTY BOY FLOYD.

Picture quality is GOOD, far better than PD stuff from MILL CREEK, ECHO BRIDGE and others, but not pristine. Sound is clear, with no heavy filtering. There were no edit repairs that I noticed, but you can see occasional white spots, certainly not enough to condemn the transfer, and it's to be expected in unrestored celluloid that's over 50 years old.

A heavy paper slipcover holds all five individually packaged discs. Each is in a standard, sturdy DVD case. There's 16 chapter stops on all films, easily accessible from a list on a single page. No subtitles or other extras are provided.

Spot check of other movies:
LET 'EM HAVE IT, the oldest here, looks and sounds wonderful. Roger Corman's I, MOBSTER is similar to PBF in condition. Points off for a full screen transfer of a Cinemascope film. RAW DEAL looks good and plays at normal speed. (Don't be fooled!) You can tell by the pitch of Raymond Burr's voice that it's OK. Anthony Mann's T-MEN has slightly lower audio fidelity, but still looks fine.

I definitely recommend this interesting DVD set!

8681959,1,B000A2WSTE,"Don't let the discounted price and the Sony label fool you. The transfers of these classics are no masters at all & look like s**t plain and simple. Speckles and jumping images abound throughout all the 5 movies. Worst of all,""I mobster"",originally in Cinemascope,is reformated in full screen and ""Raw deal"" is running at wrong speed. Avoid at all costs.

The five titles,available as singles,are:
