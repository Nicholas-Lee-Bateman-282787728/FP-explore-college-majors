3787787,4,B001T21R50,I have been waiting for Telefon to come out on DVD for a long time and now it is here.  The quality is OK due to the age of the movie and the technology is dated but It is still as good as ever with some nice twists in plot.  I had never seen St Ives before but it was a fair movie and you get both for a nice price.  All in all I give Telefon 5 stars and St. Ives 3 stars hence the rating here.,1246233600,10,395,3.465909090909091

3787814,3,B001T21R50,"Telefon is a classic of two sadly overlooked actors: Lee Remick, & Charles Bronson, not to mention one of the stand-outs of those seventies, post-Bond, less boom-more plot, spy movies. I'd searched for ages for a copy of Telefon, and so was pleased to find it on a low-cost double feature with St. Ives, a less subtle, but still entertaining Bronson movie. It was therefore a disappointment to find that, on this disc, the transfer of Telefon is very poor quality, low focus. It was not so bad to prevent enjoyment of the story, but seriously detracted from it. In fact, the worst part is that from time to time the film jumps into perfectly sharp focus for never more than a minute only then to fall back into low focus mush.

As for St Ives, it is a much better transfer of much lesser film. An acceptable second feature, but let's leave it that J. Lee Thompson was no Don Siegel.",1461283200,3,882,4.444444444444445

3787846,4,B001T21R50,"Telefon is an above-average espionage film with a disturbed Russian bureaucrat ""triggering"" former agents back into acts of aggression.  Charles
Bronson and Lee Remick are bith Russian agents trying to stop the disturbed fanatic.  Entertaining and reasonably well done.  Good performances
by the two stars who worl well together on screen.

St. Ives is a rather effective police drama about a former policeman, now writer, trying to determine who is involved in, and causing, death and
double-dealing insofar as to a wealthy man's empire and questionable activities.  Jacqueline Bisset, Maximilliam Schell, John Houseman and Dana
Elvcar are quite good in their parts and the film sustains a high level of inteest and couiosity.  John Houseman steps out of his dignified personna and actually comes off rather well in a completely different type of rome.",1425772800,,853,5.3283582089552235

  In Denver, Colorado, mechanic Harry Bascom receives a phnoe call. The man on the line sounds russian and gives him a secret message. The message put him in a trance. The mechanic goes to his private storrage room and retrieves a locked tool box. he puts the box on a compartment in front of the fender of his truck. He drives to a base and shoots the booth guard, then drives straight into the main building and it explodes.  Nicolai Dalchimsky is watching nearby.
  In Langley, Virginia at the CIA Headquarters, secretary Dorothy Putterman (Tyne Daly) finds something interesting on the computer. Strange deaths and freak accidents have occurred that have involved 24 top-brass communists having all died within a matter of 13 days. Her boss, Harley Sandberg (Frank Marth) thinks it is a ""purge"". Then they find out the real Harry Bascom died 22 years ago in Canton, Ohio from a burst appendix.
  Major Grigori Borzov (Charles Bronson) of the KGB is sent to Moscow. He is briefed on the people who have died. As it turns out, these people are secret agents in a drug-induced hypnotic state. The orders of the suicide mission are in their subconscious. The message said over the phone is the trigger that begins the deadly mission.  Major Borzov is astonished these agents were never brought out of their hypnotism.
  He is asked to go to America and go after Nicolai Dalchimsky who is calling these people and setting them off. Dalchimsky has one of the books listing all 51 agents and their whereabouts.

St. Ives (1976). Warner Bros.  Rated PG. Running Time: One hour, 33 mins.
Directed by J. Lee Thompson. Written by Barry Beckerman (screenplay), Ross Thomas (novel).

Movie will begin automatically in 2 minutes if no choice is made on main menu.

It is Sunday, October 24, in Los Angeles, California. Lawyer Myron Green goes to The Lido Hotel to the apartment of Raymond St. Ives (Charles Bronson), lets himself in and tries to wake him up. Half the day has already gone by. Raymond was a crime reporter and is now an author in the process of writing a book. His ex-wife has a summons for him. Since Raymond needs money to pay his lawyer's fee and his wife's alimony, Mr. Green has a job offer for him. He is not interested and wants to go back to sleep. The lawyer talks him into it.
  Mr. Abner Procane (John Houseman), who lives in Holmby Hills, is in need of Mr. St. Ives services. A thief has stolen five brown leather-bound ledgers from an upstairs safe. The thief is after $100,000 for an exchange. The thief will call again. Raymond will act as the ""go-between"". He is to meet a man at a laundromat at 2:00am. But if you catch the facial expression of Procane's daughter, Janet Whistler (Jacqueline Bisset), I don't think all is going to go well.

3787871,4,B001T21R50,This is an entertaining pair of movies made especially for Charles Bronson fans. Bronson is at his best outwitting the bad guys and saving the good guys to fight another day!,1400889600,,174,4.645161290322581

3787873,4,B001T21R50,Enjoyed good beating the evil. What I enjoy is there is no swearing in all of Charles movies. Liked both movies but any movie with violence in it I could not say that I love it. But I like both movies,1398384000,5,200,3.902439024390244
3787874,4,B001T21R50,"You simply cannot find Telefon, at least when I purchased this, anywhere.  And St. Ives is another one of his really good movies from the later 70's.  So, it is a great and enjoyable buy in that sense.  I marked it down a star due to the fact these movies are not remastered.  The picture can tend to be grainy at times and the audio is definitely sub-par.  Yet, I would buy it again simply to get Telefon in any form.",1397692800,,418,4.111111111111111
3787875,5,B001T21R50,"One can not go wrong with this purchase.  Some reviewers have complained about the ""softness"" of the print of TELEFON, but I saw the movie in a regular theater when it was released in the late 70s - and this is the movie/print that I remember.  I was an Army photographer at the time and was sensitive to focus, depth-of-field, etc. I do remember some ""softness,""  but there was a lot of fiddling around with filters and such at that time. But even if there are better prints out there somewhere (and I doubt that), this one is QUITE acceptable - in fact, not bad at all.  The sound levels fluctuate annoyingly in places, but no one should hesitate to buy this duo of Bronson movies.  Here is a very high degree of entertainment at a very low price.  In the unlikely event that a better print of TELEFON should appear in the future, so much the better!  This one is quite adequate for the time being.",1396656000,11,900,4.3532934131736525

Bronson plays the Russian agent sent to clean up a rogue operation before WW III is triggered.

They inform him that after the U-2 incident in fear of the possibility that a war with the U.S. will occur; they were part of an operation called TELEFON that involved recruiting young agents and then brainwashing them into believing that they are Americans.

This is just too good. Bronson is perfectly cast as a tough assassin for the GRU, and perfectly sets the feel of hostile Soviet / U.S. relations in the Cold War. Donald Pleasance is great as a greasy, egotistical pencil-pusher who's found his way to make his mark on world history.
Lee Remick is absolutely gorgeous in every scene she's in.
Watch the movie, and tell me her outfit later in the movie (where she rams Dalchimsky's station wagon with her car) was not adopted by McDonald's for their employees for years after this movie came out!! :-)",1388707200,,653,4.45

3787892,4,B001T21R50,"I've been waiting for a DVD version of an old favorite Charles Bronson movie, TELEFON, and now it's finally available from Warner Home Video--with an added bonus. It's a double-sided disc, and the other side is ST. IVES, another Bronson action flick.

TELEFON (1977) is a tight, exciting film by Don Siegel (DIRTY HARRY, etc.), based on the terrific novel by Walter Wager. It's about a Russian KGB agent (Bronson) who must team up with a beautiful woman agent (Lee Remick) to stop a rogue Russian madman (Donald Pleasence) from activating 54 ""sleepers""--Russian ""agents in place"" in the USA who were brainwashed during the Cold War and programmed to destroy vital American military sites. Now, long after the operation was scrapped by the Russians, crazy Pleasence is determined to cause mayhem and start WWIII between the two superpowers, so he's ""waking up"" the sleeping saboteurs by means of coded phone calls. And only Bronson can stop him, with the aid of Remick and a marvelously funny computer nerd played by a very young Tyne Daly (CAGNEY & LACEY). This is one of Bronson's best films.

ST. IVES (1976), directed by J. Lee Thompson (THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, etc.), is not as good as TELEFON, but it's fun, and it has a notably classy cast. Based on Donald E. Westlake's novel, THE PROCAINE CHRONICLE, it stars Bronson as Mr. St. Ives, a former cop, now a P.I. with literary aspirations (he's writing a mystery novel!), who is hired by a shady millionaire (Oscar-winner John Houseman) to retrieve some very compromising diaries from the blackmailers who stole them. Bronson sets out to do that, but he's distracted by some nosy cops, a gang of murderous thugs (including then-unknowns Robert Englund and Jeff Goldblum), Houseman's creepy psychiatrist (Oscar-winner Maximilian Schell), and his beautiful, seductive ward (Jacqueline Bisset). What's an ex-cop/P. I./budding novelist to do? This is Bronson in a lighter mode, and he's charming.

So, two Bronson flicks for the price of one--and they're both very entertaining. Good anamorphic prints, with original theatrical trailers for both and a bonus mini-doc about the making of ST. IVES. Enjoy!",1376265600,3,2151,5.070621468926554

Both movies are enjoyable and keep the violence and swearing to the minimum unlike modern movies.,1352851200,17,432,4.430379746835443
3787909,4,B001T21R50,"I say that with a great deal of affection, by the way.  This disc offers two Charles Bronson movies from his peak in the mid 1970s.  'St Ives' is the best of the two, Charles playing (very well)a crime writer who has been asked by one of those rich, southern California recluses to 'do a deal' with some nasties, and so ends up in a web of lies and violence.  What's amazing is how cool Bronson plays the role of St Ives.  He's so laid back that the weirdness and violence almost seem to roll off his back.  Bronson is really good in this, and the movie benefits from also starring Jacqueline Bissett and John Houseman (is it my imagination or was Houseman playing every old man in every movie in the 70s?). -- 'Telefon' is a great deal of fun and Bronson does his best to play a Russian general who is uncovering a huge sabotage plot involving the telephone (not cell phones, but the old stuck in the wall, have- to- dial phones).  This movie is so improbable you just have to roll with it (the movie 'The Naked Gun' used the same plot device for comedic purposes years later).  'Telefon' is fun and a nice memory of 1977. -- Charles Bronson was not the most dynamic of movie personalities and wasn't exactly a comfortable fit among the Eastwoods and the Harrison Fords.  But he had his niche, and when the right material came along, he could slip into it and deliver the goods, like in 'St Ives.'  He is unconventional, and that's a good thing.

3787930,3,B001T21R50,"Despite being packaged like any one of a dozen cheap Public Domain compilations (you know, the ones that usually include The Valdez Horses/Chino and an episode of Man with a Camera they're trying to pass off as a movie), this release is a legitimate one from Warner Home Video bringing together a couple of Bronson's 70s output just before his fame began to wane.

Although little loved by fans of Ross Thompson's novel, St. Ives is an entertaining thriller with largely unrealised aspirations to being seen as a throwback to Warners' 1940s detective movies. Charles Bronson's the heavy gambling retired crime writer and would-be novelist of the title, hired by John Houseman's gentleman crook to act as go-between for a series of incriminating volumes only to stumble across dead bodies in tumble dryers and burglars who've taken the shortcut to the sidewalk via the window. It's not an action film, an elevator shaft fight and a climactic shootout notwithstanding. Instead it's a slightly quirky number full of neat little touches, be it Houseman watching The Big Parade and Birth of a Nation because, as his analyst Maximilian Schell explains, ""Films really are dreams, especially old movies, and Abner loves them. They're good dreams for Abner. They're splendid, splendid therapy,"" Elisha Cook (no longer billed as Jr.) turning up as a hotel clerk who can even sleep through a shootout in the lobby or an amusing scene where a drop-off in the toilets in Union Station turns into a quirky discussion of restroom quirks. With some surprising faces popping up in the cast (Daniel J. Travanti, Jeff Goldblum, Robert Englund among them), it's an enjoyable 90 minutes that aims to be nothing more than a good night out at the pictures, and in this case that's enough.

Warner's DVD offers a good widescreen transfer with original trailer and brief behind the scenes short as extras.

By the end of the 70s, world politics presented an increasing credibility problem to producers: how do you make a Cold War thriller in the age of dtente? By having a good Russian trying to stop a bad Russian starting WW3 by activating several suicidal sleeper agents planted all over America during the Stalin era and long forgotten by the new management was the solution 1977's Telefon offered. Charles Bronson's the good Russian chasing fellow Great Escaper Donald Pleasance's bad Russian with the help of Lee Remick before the renegade Stalinist can write his name across the United States by triggering a series of pointless suicide bombings on out-of-date targets. A workable enough premise, but it's a film that never goes quite as far as it could. It's fun that a couple of the suicidal sleepers are a priest and an All-American pancake-making mom, but that's as far at stereotype subverting as it goes with the rest an anonymous bunch. The film's never quite as cold-blooded as it needs to be either: when he's unable to stop one reactivated sleeper, Bronson strangles him instead, yet it's a rather polite and bloodless scene that sheepishly cuts away. While it provides plenty of explosions it rarely kicks into full gear. There's one good chase in a San Francisco hotel familiar to anyone who's seen The Towering Inferno or High Anxiety that comes to a satisfyingly explosive end in an underground car park, but the film's climax seems more adequate than inspired. There's not even the remotest flicker of sexual chemistry between Bronson and Remick to carry the film between things blowing up.

It wasn't exactly an untroubled shoot, with original director and co-writer Peter Hyams being replaced by Don Siegel (Hyams also found himself fired from Steve McQueen's last film, The Hunter - obviously he didn't endear himself to the Magnificent Seven), although some of his typically quirky dialogue survives in lines like Tyne Daly's CIA computer analyst's comment ""That's exactly the kind of attitude that led to the downfall of the Hittite Empire."" The change in directors occasionally makes itself felt in wild changes in cinematography from pin-sharp to that irritatingly over-diffused soft focus that ran rampant in the late-70s, but the over-riding impression is of an average movie but not a particularly unlikeable one.

Unfortunately, as with the TV prints, the picture quality on this widescren NTSC transfer is pretty inconsistent: sharp in some scenes, grainy in others. The only extra is the original trailer.",1287619200,7,4415,5.050754458161865

Thia copy is a must for Bronson fans",1271635200,2,268,4.2745098039215685

Pros: The price is excellent, the action is not 2010 quality but still very impressive and the stories are entertaining.
Cons; The sound is without surround, the quality of the picture is far from perfect and the acting is not close to any oscars.
I recommend them to any person that wants relaxing movies to watch after a long day at work and ready to watch anything without being too picky.",1271548800,19,618,4.4298245614035086
3787934,4,B001T21R50,"Thanks to Amazon, I finally was able to add Telefon to my Charles Bronson collection; however, be warned that this DVD is very poor in picture quality.  The content of the movie itself is excellent.  One would think that Warner could make a sharper image on this DVD.  Maybe one day, we will have the technology to get sharp pictures on all DVDs.",1269648000,17,346,4.4603174603174605
3787935,3,B001T21R50,"Watched the movie Lola which is in this set, a bit of a departure for Bronson this film would have been quite risky at the time for the content. He plays a middle-aged writer of porn novels who falls in love with a sixteen year old school girl while in retreat in Britain. They then get married and move to the States , but it all turns to custard after that as we all know can be the problem to people with huge age gaps between them. A semi kind of comedy/drama , easy to watch stars a young Susan George and directed by the legendary Richard Donner.",1268265600,23,552,4.12037037037037
3787936,5,B001T21R50,"I've been a huge fan of Charles Bronson since I was in my early teens. The guy was one hell of an actor...God rest his soul. He was great in just about every movie I've seen him in. He's among my list of favorite action film stars. He played a great part in both Telefon and St. Ives.

3787938,4,B001T21R50,"I have a copy of Telefon in widescreen taped from TV that was a much better transfer than this.  The DVD picture is so soft on this new release that it appears to almost be out of focus altogether a great deal of the film.  A great disappointment that they felt Telefon needed to be released as a two-fer with another title that was already out, and then released with some generic cover. What was wrong with the great theatrical artwork?!?!

Sure you can say ""At least it got a release"" but this scares me for the remaining Bronson DVD releases that have not yet arrived - Stone Killer, White Buffalo, Machine Gun Kelly, and From Noon til Three.

Maybe Region 2 will do it some justice.  If you do buy this release, get it on the cheap and lower your expectations....",1256947200,50,768,4.380281690140845
