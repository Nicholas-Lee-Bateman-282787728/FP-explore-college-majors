7957134,5,B00005YUOS,"Seems to me that the reviewer with the Ph. D. takes things far too seriously. He complains that none of this footage is put into context, interpreted, etc. But the point of this collection is to offer news reel and other footage that is NOT INTERPRETED AT ALL. A bit refreshing, actually. Especially for instructors and students alike who can offer their own interpretations, without being co-opted or influenced by any narration.

 This collection doesn't pretend to be a documentary in the traditional sense; it simply offers the viewer a most interesting collection of archival film footage related to combat in the 20th century. And this stuff is British, not US. So it isn't the same material we are used to seeing from the National Archives, used time and again in documentaries.

 As for the other reviewer's complaint about the oddly edited footage set to buffoonish music...I can hardly believe that he didn't recognize the piece as a very entertaining piece of propaganda, produced by the cheeky British at the height of the Battle of Britain.

 Yes, this collection no doubt will leave viewers with some questions; but we can always go to the internet and find some answers, can't we? ""Archives of War"" offers no real interpretation of events -- definitely a rare occurrence in the world of documentaries.",1170028800,5,1316,4.959090909090909
