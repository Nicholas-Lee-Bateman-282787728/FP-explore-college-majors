2194101,3,B0006SSQR0,"This Piranha Rip Off actually isn't AS bad as the people say it is. It does have VERY bad acting, bad settings, etc. But the storyline is original.

The film starts off with a plane crashing into a river. The plane is carrying Piranha's and they escape. A CIA agent is sent out to take care of the problem and kill whoever is aware of the fish.

A resort owner is aware of the problem and goes out to stop them as well.

One mans girlfriend goes out into the lake and dies, which leads him to go out and hunt as well.

So this film ends up with all the characters coming together and meeting their fate, which they all do.

At the end, the CIA agent, after taking care of the fish, he goes into his van, turns it on and -BOOOM-, his automobile explodes! Of course the explosion is SOOO FAKE...literally its just a fire ball and that's it. Turns out the man who sent the agent to kill the fish sent another man to kill him!.....very confusing if you haven't seen the film all the way through. (Which might be impossible!)

The music on this film is rather odd. It's like techno music but it kind of fits somehow.

The DVD itself is very good! The disc looks better than most of the DVD's you would find in stores. The special features include a Behind-the-Scenes and Commentary track by the Directors.

If you like B-Movie's, this one is for you.",1313020800,,1345,4.267716535433071
2194102,1,B0006SSQR0,"A plane carrying piranha crashes into a resort lake, releasing its cargo. The fish then attack people, both in and out of the lake.

Nearly everything about this movie is inept, but there is one moment that, at least for me, signaled the lack of any possibility of redemption. A man who has gone to the area to investigate the crash checks in at a resort hotel, where the clerk hands him a room key. However, when the camera zooms in, we see that the key is actually for a Toyota. Apparently, nobody in the crew or cast had any other key. Then, when the man returns to his vehicle rather than the room, a strange man hobbling on a Tiny Tim-like crutch approaches and warns, in the most  hackneyed Scooby-Doo homage, that the traveler should go away.

This low-budget fare should be avoided.

2194103,1,B0006SSQR0,"This is a case where Amazon needs a zero star setting. This film completely re-defines what really bad cinema is like. Holy gazoly! Maybe it should be shown to high school students as an example of what NOT to do! The acting is so bad that it is hard to believe people off the street could do worse. The costumes are wrong, as well as awful. Would a government agent snoop around the woods in a suit and tie (in summer), and wearing white sneakers? It is all wrong.
The piranhas are all stuffed and look dead. The ""action"" and ""underwater"" scenes are completely faked, and look it.
The settings are fake, too, and look really cheap, and amateurish. The ""fancy hotel"" looks like one of those roadside tourist stations when you enter a state. In fact, I think it was!
But the worst is yet to come: when people die in this film, and piranha-death would be really painful, the victims don't scream, there merely, and softly, go ""oh-oh-oh"" sort of like a bored orgasm.

Oddly, the director's comments were done really well--almost as if that was the rationale for making this movie.",1202169600,5,1077,4.551546391752577
2194104,5,B0006SSQR0,This is a great horror movie that's much better than Piranha done at a much lower budget filmed in Morgantown West Virginia. It's a must see!!!,1139875200,6,143,4.538461538461538
8042761,1,B0006SSQR0,"...and not a very funny one, either. Even piranhas deserve more respect than this. Really - come on now!! Sitting through this was even more painful than sitting through 'Forest Of Demons' - that's how bad this was. The acting was atrocious, the storyline was lukewarm at best and the fish looked like those little plastic toys they sell at a discount in tourist shops. Looks like I found a flick that wins the Dud Award - 'Forest' is no longer at the bottom of the list. This one is! Good grief...",1525046400,,498,4.423913043478261
8042762,1,B0006SSQR0,"I forced myself to watch 13 minutes and 43 seconds of this movie before I couldn't take it anymore.  For me if I would have endured to the end of this movie it would have been torture!

This movie is an insult to movie-lovers everywhere!

Watch at your own risk!",1524700800,,262,4.2
8042763,5,B0006SSQR0,"If you feel like spending one evening by laughing uncontrollably at your TV or computer screen, this is the movie for you. Don't look for mundane film-things like a story, character development or a satisfying climax - those things are left to the amateurs. This is beyond any possible human comprehension. Superb!! You will appreciate the complete ineptitude of setting up a story of some sort, the great locations used for the flick (the hotel by the lake has a great lobby... not!!), the Agent sent (presumably) by the Government, who seems to have the I.Q. of a beet, and everything else, including a score made by someone who was clearly watching another movie.

Do not miss this movie if you want to have a ball with your friends and you enjoy talk back at films. It's a riot!!",1524182400,,783,4.633093525179856

8042765,1,B0006SSQR0,"This is the worse film I have ever seen.  It deserves a -0 rating or less.  The acting is horrific, the plot stupid and the fish are stuffed and look like it.  They are just rigid  but somehow biting and eating people without opening and closing their mouths.  Really ignorant and one of the lowest budget films made.  When being eaten, NO ONE screams, its low moans and oh, oh oh, and no one ever heads back to shore, they just stand there and get eaten.  Really have to have a sick mind to enjoy this one.  I have to give this an F grade in all aspects.",1523232000,,555,4.074074074074074

8042769,5,B0006SSQR0,Bought this movie here on amazon for a great price just $34.00 and i was presently surprised to find it was directed by the polonia brothers. This was a very interesting film to see.,1515369600,2,182,4.382352941176471
8042770,3,B0006SSQR0,"This independent movie is very low budget. They might have filmed it with a MiniDV camcorder. Considering how cheap it is, I thought it was pretty good.  They obviously had very little money to work with, so don't expect that much from it.  Despite the budget, I thought it was very well scored; The techno type music is very well done.  There's some cheap gore, no nudity, and a very small handful of piranhas; and in a funny badly acted scene, a guy on crutches goes into the water and tries to club the fish with his crutches for no reason whatsoever. Some people that are used to seeing these really cheap independent movies might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to a lot of people. The piranhas never move their jaws when they eat people. According to the interview on the DVD, they used real stuffed piranhas from a taxidermist. There's only a really small amount of them in the movie, so don't expect anything like in PIRANHA or PIRANHA 3D. None of the gore is extreme, and the movie has no suspense or atmosphere. The directing isn't bad for a such a cheap film, but there isn't any interesting characters or anything really involving in the movie. The place where they filmed the movie is OK, and the good soundtracks really help the movie.

The DVD quality is very good, and you get a decent interview.",1328572800,2,1317,4.497907949790795
