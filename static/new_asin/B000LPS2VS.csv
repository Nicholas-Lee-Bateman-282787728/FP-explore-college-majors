I didn't learn until years later that Duel had committed suicide, which saddened me so much because he'd seemed to have such a bright future ahead.  But that's the wonderful thing about video and now DVD -- it allows us to remember and keep alive the work of fine actors, actresses, directors, etc.  I can't wait to get this, and hope the other seasons will be brought out as well.",1170028800,14,520,4.275510204081633

Picking up where Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid left off, this pair of prime time bandits always had a light touch as they found ingenuous ways to skirt the law and other desperados alike.

I spent so many years searching for this show to be broadcast somewhere,  then nearly two years ago Encore Westerns began to run the series, and I thought that was the best there could be--I finally got to see all of the episodes (with the exception of the second season opener), many I hadn't seen for 30+ years!  Now to have the first season out on commercially produced DVDs (with seasons 2 and 3 not far behind, I hope!) this is the very best!

It showed at the end of the cowboy era on TV and it was a worthy addition to the genre. Two conmen/outlaws trying to go straight when the rest of the world didn't know it made for some very fun situations. There was a ton of great guest stars, too.

My family has tried buying old TV shows at places like Cracker Barrel where there are many to choose from, but have been disappointed by the low (or complete lack of) quality with which they are produced.  A welcome breath of fresh air, this copy of Alias Smith and Jones Season One demonstrates very high quality considering what it is (an old TV show).  The audio mix is clear and un-messed-with.  What I mean by this is that whoever produced this particular DVD did not try to ""improve"" upon the original for the sake of so called ""Digitally remastering"" it.  What ever was done to this season of shows was done professionally and legitimately.

2712524,5,B000LPS2VS,"Chemistry!

How else can you sum up Alias Smith and Jones in one word?  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful.  It makes the show so much fun to watch.  Humor is the other reason to watch this show.  It's just such a fun series!

Yes, there are some silly moments... moments that don't hold up very well... but overall the series seems surprisingly fresh and vivid.

The reason I started watching this show is... let's be honest... Pete Duel.  He's such a wonderful actor, and so VERY handsome!

I watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after I watched this series and yes, there are definitely similarities!  That doesn't make me like it any less, though.  Actually, I believe both were based loosely off real events?

The story follows Kid Curry and Hannibal Heyes, two outlaws going straight.  They're trying to get amnesty, and have to stay out of trouble till the governor decides they've earned it.

The first episode started out really silly, in my opinion.  But I very quickly became a fan.  The plots are fun, and the characters and actors are really fun to watch!  I wish I'd known about this series years ago!",1313798400,,1132,4.636363636363637
2712525,5,B000LPS2VS,"I just recently re-discovered this gem of a series. I was watching the Flip Wilson Show in 1971 so I missed the classic ""Alias Smith & Jones"" in its first run. It turns out that it really holds up after all this time. Such a fun, wholesome series with snappy dialogue, danger, thrills and an interesting message in every show. The leads, Pete Duel and Ben Murphy are so good in their roles that I can't see anyone else as Kid Curry and Hannibal Heyes but them. Maybe even the real Kid Curry would pale in comparison to Ben's Kid. Tons of old school guest stars, Slim Pickens, Burl Ives, Caesar Romero, Michelle Lee, Sally Field to name a few, make this the 'go to' show for the last of the television great 'Buddy/Western' comedies. It's a blast to see the old 'Universal Studios Backlot' in almost all of the shots. I can't get enough of this show!",1305072000,3,849,4.379746835443038

2712528,5,B000LPS2VS,"This light comic Western was probably consciously based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000EXDS5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, but it creates a world and characters all its own and is perhaps the best note on which the great TV-Western era could have begun to go out.  Hannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) and Kid Curry (Ben Murphy), ""the two most successful outlaws in the history of the West,"" are the leaders of Wyoming's infamous Devil's Hole Gang.  Heyes is a born manipulator and con artist, a safecracker without peer, and a keen judge of human character; the Kid may be one of the fastest guns who ever lived.  But they're finding the outlaw trail a tougher one to ride: the safes are getting stronger, the posses more resolute, and the telegraph is everywhere.  So, after an unproductive tussle with a Brooker 440 safe, they make up their minds to go straight--if the Governor can be persuaded to issue them an amnesty: with $10,000 apiece on their heads, their only other option would be to leave the country.  An old friend, a former outlaw turned sheriff, acts as their go-between, but the Governor can't commit political suicide by giving them an amnesty right off: the banks and railroads are too mad at them.  So he lays down conditions: stay out of trouble for a year (or maybe more) and earn their freedom.  And in the course of the series they try to do just that--but it isn't easy.  Saddled by their sheriff friend with their unimaginative aliases of Smith (Heyes) and Jones (Curry), to which they subsequently add Joshua and Thaddeus, roaming from Wyoming to Texas and Mexico to Arizona and back again, locking horns with lawmen, other outlaws, bounty hunters, con artists, ordinary folks gone crooked, and the occasional murderer, and making their way by Heyes's poker skill and silver tongue and Curry's quick gunhand, they struggle to stay on the straight and narrow and start a new life.

Lighter in tone than most Westerns of its era, AS&J is still a delightful ride with plenty of fast action, and it's also full of complicated plots and cons (Sam Jaffe appears twice as a successful retired con man named Soapy who owes ""the boys"" a large favor) and occasional very close escapes.  It's also one of the all-time best ""buddy"" series ever filmed: Heyes and Curry's good-natured ribbing of each other and occasional friendly, low-key rivalry over a girl shows clearly that they know each other well and enjoy a mutual respect and affection.  The chemistry between Duel and Murphy is unmistakable, and Heyes's mobile face, safecracker's hands, and clear, bell-like voice, Curry's youthful features and way of looking sad just before he draws, and the seemingly utterly natural grace of movement both have, make them among the most attractive Western heroes ever to appear on the small screen.  To judge from what I've learned over 40-odd years of research into the American West, they're probably actually a much more accurate portrayal of outlawry than the vicious murderers seen in so much of the genre: probably 80% of Western outlaws weren't ""badmen,"" but jobless cowboys gone wrong, who'd drifted into the life from a love of action and adventure, a need to help out a friend or meet a temporary shortage of funds, often urged along by the stimulus of strong drink.  Heyes and Curry take great pride in the fact that ""When we were robbing banks we didn't kill people,"" which makes them very sympathetic and easy to root for.  (Trivia buffs may be interested to know that ""A Fistful of Diamonds"" was based on an actual incident: a ""genuine salted diamond field"" con was actually run in northwestern Colorado in 1872.)

Just finished watching ""Don't Get Mad, Get Even"" an episode from a later season with Michele Lee and Robert Middleton.  What a great series with a great many stars....in this same episode Walter Brennan appeared. One of my favorite recurring actors was J.D. Cannon, the conniving detective. I have many of the series shows on several VHS from cable, but nothing can compare to the DVD.

It's hard to believe the first season of Smith & Jones goes back to 1971, a much younger me watched them on TV. Much later I began to watch and tape them on Encore Westerns.  Now, finally, they are out on DVD and I have at long last received my own copy of the First Season. Goodbye VHS copies!

Though I enjoy more 'serious' western fare too, this series due to the interplay between the actors and the relatively good scripts has always captured my attention. Even after the original twosome ended due to Duel's death, the new partnership took on a life of its own and it is impossible for me to say which set of two actors did best. I liked them both and I suppose that contributed to the longer running of the series.

Well, here's to many more sets of their DVDs being released.  What a great series.  Now if Warner Bros. will only release a few more Cheyenne DVDs, hmmmm.

'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' and the two leads have excellent chemistry. Sadly, Peter Duel took his own life at the height of the series popularity.

The first season includes the pilot TV movie and the first 14 episodes. The shows look very good with minimal wear and tear. The opening sequence is more battered than the shows themselves, so don't get your ""chaps"" in a bunch when you start to watch this great series.

Extras include commentary and not too much else, but the show is worth owning if your a fan of the series and 70's TV.

The scripts are written with humor and enough of a plot to keep your interest over the 30 some years since they were on prime time.  It is a shame that due to the times in the early 70's and the death of Pete Duel that the series wasn't produced for more seasons.  One of the joys in watching season one was again seeing many of my favorite stars from my childhood performing again, reminding me why I liked to watch them, and how much I miss seeing them on screen.",1207440000,,616,4.239316239316239
2712537,5,B000LPS2VS,"I'd give this six stars if I could. I was fourteen years of age when Alias Smith and Jones first hit BBC2 (major terrestrial channel here in the UK) and the memory has stayed with me ever since. It was an instant success and the cheerful, self-effacing style of AS&J was irresistable. At its height the British Broadcasting Corporation was receiving 5,000 letters a week demanding more episodes and rapid re-runs.

For the first time we had a Western series that featured two amiable rogues as the lead characters. The level of scripting and the storylines were, for the most part, very original and highly intelligent, but what carried the series was the free-wheeling approach of the late Pete Duel (as Hannibal Heyes) and Ben Murphy (Kid Curry). Some of the stories involved quite sophisticated ""stings"", making it almost a Western version of the present-day Hustle, and clearly AS&J was closely modelled on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (and a good premise at that).

Watching the pilot episode is just so uplifting and reminded me just how good some classic television can be; it's not all about designer suits and hairstyles. And essentially, unlike many old TV series, AS&J has not dated. It looks great, it's funny, uplifting and so refreshing in its approach. I'm not sure that anything's come near it since. The only negative point is that the sad and untimely death of Pete Duel cost the series a key player after he'd filmed around 32 episodes. The dozen or so that followed were of a similar quality but it wasn't easy to replace him, although Roger Davis made a gallant effort.

I could start quoting memorable one-liners or dialogues from the series. I'll resist the temptation and just affirm that this is, without reservation, an excellent series. Buy it and enjoy it! Oh, and roll on Season 2 please.....",1204675200,4,1827,4.830670926517572

I never found Roger Davis to be as believerble as a baddy turned good.

Pete Duel and Ben Murphy were my idols when I was 13 (and impressionable) and I had their faces plastered over my bedroom wall from copies of Tiger Beat!  These two charming cowboys captured my imagination and my heart and this first season is a joy to watch.  Alias Smith & Jones was never repeated in NZ after the first screening, however I can remember quite vividly many of the plots and more importantly the fabulous guest stars that popped up in each episode.  The show was never the same when Pete Duel died tragically and was replaced by Roger Davis, so this first season is very special and I recommend it to all those who enjoyed the good, clean stories, the humour, the outback setting and most importantly the obvious comraderie between Duel and Murphy.",1182816000,3,911,4.570552147239264

2712579,5,B000LPS2VS,"When this show debuted in 1971, I was only 13. Not that I was, or my parents were TV snobs, I didn't watch too much on television at that time. I was busy trying to discover all I could about the fairer sex, playing baseball and being with friends. Besides, we only had one television in our house and Dad usually got to watch his shows.

Now that I'm 48, I've been watching some older shows from when I was a kid. I had absolutely no idea what this series was about, but with my current interest in ""Westerns"", thought I'd Alias Smith & Jones a shot.

I've watched a few older televison shows, and I must say that this is one of the best from that period, and to me will probably end up on my top 10 list of all-time favorites.

The stories are fun to watch and even though some shows are weaker than others, they still retain quite a bit of charm. They also have held up pretty well over the years and are not too dated. Some of the music and one episode with a made-for-television-""pop"" song, do give hints as to what year these were released, but kind of adds a bit of nostalgia from those times.

The video transfer was done very well. Color's are bright and vivid on HDTV. I do notice some ""jumpy"" sections at times during the episodes, but I'm wondering if this isn't just my DVD player.

If you're a Western type of person or if you'd like to give a television Western a try, Alias Smith and Jones would be a good set to start with.

It was in the days before VHS, at least for the common folk, so I fondly recall holding my little portable tape recorder up to the TV to record an episode. Corny? You bet. Now as a grown-up, I can relax in my cushy sofa, and watch these fun episodes, and the humor is just as good now as it was then. And they are just as handsome!

The premise is plausible: if they can stay out of trouble for an entire year, they can get amnesty. Unfortunately, the only ones that know are their former comrade-now sheriff, and the Governor. Good hearted criminals, helping the helpless, trying to go straight. Constantly running into troublesome situations.

I wish this set had a booklet with some fun facts about the filming, or some bloopers, or interview / commentary with some of the cast today. Maybe in the next set.

Now, anyone can get on TV regardless of their lack of talent.  As you watch each epsiode unfold it becomes evident that Pete Dual was an excellent actor who had great comedic talent.  Ben Murphy's acting talent gets better with each show. The brotherhood and close camaraderie between the characters Smith and Jones remind me of the Simon Brothers in Simon and Simon.

2712620,5,B000LPS2VS,"""Alias Smith and Jones"" debuted on ABC in January 1971, little more than a year after the release of the mammothly successful ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Ripping-off theatrical hits was nothing new for series television, but ""Alias Smith and Jones,"" though perhaps only intended to cash-in on the success of the Paul Newman-Robert Redford hit, stood on its own two feet and is a bonafide, albeit unheralded, classic.

The show's wit is reminiscent of ""Maverick"" in a way, and that's not surprising since it came from the same creator: Roy Huggins (who also gave us ""The Fugitive"").

""Alias Smith and Jones"" excelled with fine writing and expert direction from such TV masters as Barry Shear and Jeff Corey. It also had a better than average lineup of guest stars with such luminaries as Burl Ives, Wally Cox, Walter Brennan, and even Sally Field turning up, and often more than once. The show's biggest appeal, however, was Pete Duel and Ben Murphy who had a definite chemistry as the two charming outlaws.

The release of season one on DVD is the best news I've heard in a long time. Hopefully, Universal will follow with season two in short order.

2712621,5,B000LPS2VS,"The Smith and Jones series was very popular in the seventies. It was made initally as a spin off of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The series however created a unique style of it's own coupling good stories with humour. It is surprising that this is the first DVD to be produced of this excellent series. The story is of a pair of good natured but highly successful outlaws who have decided that the train and bank robbery business is not worth the risk following the improvements in safe design and the determination of possies. So they decide to apply for amnesty. The problem is that politically the governor cannot simply grant this to sucessful bandits, so they have to stay out of trouble for 12 months to prove their reform. This inevitbaly leads to problems which are the basis of the story line. This DVD is long overdue and great fun.",1174348800,3,849,4.555555555555555

2712637,5,B000LPS2VS,"The Glen Larson commentary on the pilot is sparse--he doesn't talk most of the time, and he does't talk about Duel or Murphy much at all.  But it does have some interesting historical tidbits and info on what was going through the minds of the show's creators.  It may not be much, but compared to the non-existent special features on other old t.v. westerns, it's very, very welcome.

I liked the way the main menu came up--it looks like a wanted poster is being hung, then bang, bang, bang, bang as four nails are being hammered in.

I also really like the theme music and the music during the episodes.  This show is just so darn good-natured--you can't help but enjoy it.  Most of the episodes really do deal with the problems a couple of train robbers might encounter while trying to go straight.  Duel and Murphy play it just right--not too heavy and not too light.  They both just look so easy going and natural, and their friendship seems very real.  The characters of Heyes and Curry never come off as preachy or like martyrs--they just seem like two decent men who really do try to help out anyone in trouble.  They stand up for themselves, but in a smart way--they never seem cocky.  Heyes and Curry never blend into each other--they are two very distinct characters.

It's an uneven season--there are some clunkers on disc two, but overall it's a great show.  Because it's over 30 years old, the episodes strech out towards 50 minutes, too, which is a plus for modern viewers.

It looked quite good on my 32"" flat panel TV.  I watched the pilot episode which I'm not sure I've seen before.  This series doesn't disappoint and doesn't have a dated feel to it.  Maybe because it already takes place in another time?  The chemistry of Pete Duel and Ben Murphy is fabulous.  The humor and the way it underplays itself holds up very nicely.  I'm hoping this series will be a success so that the next two seasons will also be released.  Season 2 is probably the best of the bunch as that's when Duel and Murphy really hit their stride.  Most sadly, Pete Duel committed suicide during the second season and was immediately replaced by Roger Davis.  Davis does an excellent job considering the incredibly tough situation he was put into.  Though Davis and Murphy work very well together its still not the same.  Enjoy this classic series.  It was an original in its day and still holds up that way.",1172188800,20,1052,4.439790575916231

2712640,5,B000LPS2VS,"I have all my ""biggies"" from the 70's. Columbo, Kung Fu, AITF, Rockford; I'm sure you guys know the long list. Anyway, I had never heard of this show much less ""seen"" it before. How can this be? This show is FANTASTIC!! I had some extra bucks laying around, plus I did like Pete Duel from Gidget even though I didn't care for the show; so I gambled. Well, the chemistry and writing are top notch, the story is interesting, and the humor is perfect, I couldn't be more pleased.

Sadly, this isn't a full season of 22-24 eps, though 15 seems enough I suppose. The transfer quality is pretty good for a show this old, the sound is standard fare, but they really did a nice job with the boxart and ONE sided discs. Gary A. Larsons commentary is generally helpful (when he speaks) and I find it a bit funny he says this is ""one of his favorite shows"" he has produced, I had to read between the lines but when I saw he was also the creator of Night Rider, I quickly realized he meant this IS his favorite but he was too polite to say:) C'mon, Alias Smith and Jones... or drek from the 80's like Night Rider? Gah.

2712642,5,B000LPS2VS,"Finally this classic western is released to DVD! Universal has done a fine job the shows themselves look extremely good (with just a bit of dirt and grit during the opening montage for each episode--probably due to the original source elements). We get the entire first season of the series as well as the TV movie that essentially served as a pilot episode for the series. While the tone differed a bit from the pilot, the series is equally as good with top notch production values and acting.

The story revolves around Hannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) and Kid Curry (Ben Murphy)a pair of robbers who never killed anyone as they broke the law (although interestingly, Roger Davis who went on to play Hannibal Heyes played a villian that WAS killed by Curry)during the regular season. They're given an option to go straight by the governor (they see a handbill offering amnesty to criminals who haven't committed any murders)--if they can stay clean for an entire year. It'll be their secret until the 12 months (probably in case it fails) are up but that also means the guys are fair game for bounty hunters who may discover their identity. Trouble follows them wherever they go though and they end up performing one good deed after another hoping that they don't get caught in the gun of someone's crosshairs since the original wanted poster still says ""Dead or Alive"".

The first season set include the pilot movie plus the first 14 episodes of the show (the show was a mid-season replacement which is why it doesn't have a full season of 22-24 episodes). While clearly inspired by ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" the film achieves its own quirky tone by the first regular season episode. Duel and Murphy's charm and chemistry on camera is immediately evident. 30 plus years later the show still retains its charm.

The show looks good in its first ever DVD presentation. Colors have faded a bit (but that's to be expected given the age of the show)and some of the stock footage (including the opening for the pilot)has some dirt, grit and a bit of wear and tear evident but overall the show looks darn good. The guest star list is a who's who of TV from the 70's including Early Holliman, Forrest Tucker and Susan Saint and James Drury--just in the pilot episode alone! Later guest stars would include Burl Ives, Slim Pickens and Sally Field among many others.

The lone extra here is a commentary track by co-creator/co-writer/producer Glen A. Larson. While there are some stretches of silence Larson's comments are intelligent, observant and has trivia about how the series came to be produced. He notes that the amnesty plot that makes the series different from other westerns was real and, in fact, was offered to Butch and Sundance as well as the real Kid Curry. When news of the amnesty was delayed, they got mad and robbed a bank blowing their chance of receiving it!

2712643,5,B000LPS2VS,"This short-lived series was a small screen version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It offered appealing actors who had a great chemistry with each other. Please note that I am referring only to the eps that starred Pete Duel and Ben Murphy. Honestly, I couldn't bear to watch it after Pete died. I always found the decision to just stick another actor in the role like no one would care to be a crass mistake.

Having recently re-watched the episodes I have to say its aged remarkably well. I think you really have to thank the writers for this. Oh sure, there's a few spots where you know its not a recent show (note the horrible music in a few eps) but overall you'd be hard pressed to date this 30+ year old show.

Both actors are perfect in their roles as two ""pretty good bad men"" who are trying to go straight. They have to contend with not only lawmen, posses, and other outlaws, but their own less than sterling natures. Some eps focused on light comedy (The MacCreedy Bust) while others are starkly dramatic (The Bounty Hunter)Both were handled equally well by the cast.

It offers something for everyone. Good writing/scripts, handsome outlaws, light comedy, drama/angst, and a hint of danger all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Southwest (yep, them are real locations..)If you are a fan of westerns you simply can't go wrong with this series.",1170720000,22,1370,4.62962962962963
