8104683,3,B000E371JQ,This movie was much shorter than I expected. Didn't seem to provide any additional details than what I had already read about the story online. Overall a good movie  to summarize the story but not as in depth as I would have liked for how much it cost.,1374969600,2,252,4.25

8104685,4,B000E371JQ,"A & E does a great job summarizing the actual events and dispelling the mythology of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. Though some descendants of the famous feudists disagree on the causes of the this epic dispute, it is clear that this documentary outlines the commonly agreed upon ingredients, including the 1878 hog trial where family patriarch Randolph McCoy accused his neighbor Floyd Hatfield of stealing one of his hogs. Additionally, the legal machinations of attorney and part time jailer Perry Cline are also discussed, particularly his hard feelings over losing prime timber land to Devil Anse Hatfield. Other famous occurrences including the Johnse Hatfield/Roseanna McCoy romance, the murder of Ellison Hatfield and subsequent retribution killings of Tolbert, Pharmer and Randolph McCoy Jr. are also included. Hatfield-McCoy scholars such as the late Dr. Otis Rice and Kentucky College professor James Klotter are on hand to add credibility to this outstanding documentary.",1144627200,14,977,5.563758389261745
