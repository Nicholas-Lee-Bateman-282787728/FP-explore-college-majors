8016463,4,B0001US7CC,"I bought this film because Jeff Speakman was in it. He was good in his role. Flanery carries the film. Adams is also good as a new detective tracking a viligante. This is about child murderers/ molesters and a vigilante who tracks them down and kills them. There are many fight scenes where the vigilante beats up the various villains and kills them. This film is mainly for fans of Flanery. Speakman has several scenes but he is a secondary character. There is no sex, nudity or profanity in this film. It has mature themes and several shootings occur. Recommended for fans of Sean Patrick Flanery. Only die hard Speakman fans will want to see this as he isn't the hero of this film. He plays a martial arts instructor.",1485129600,,720,4.546153846153846

8016468,3,B0001US7CC,"The theme of this movie is not an easy one. Actors are influenced by
the story, scripting of the story, time of release, how it all touches their personal lives and movie budget, among other things. Do we need a perfect performance in a movie? I wonder whether so-called ""imperfect"" or ""flawed"" movies have themes which lie closer to actual life. I tend to leave room for this myself. I give this film 3 stars when comparing it with others. On it's own merit, I would rate it higher. In addition, it could have been one which the actors just used to list on their resumes. I really don't know. The title is ironic, as the actual ""gunman' turns out to be a woman. I list this film as a quiet one which doesn't shout a message. It's just there to attract those who will be touched by the message itself.",1233360000,,801,4.311258278145695
8016469,5,B0001US7CC,"DVD came early, which is super. God whose idea of sending them as gifts when there are several DVD movies in a package so I do not have to pay taxes for them danmark. Jeg are very happy with your service otherwise",1233187200,,213,4.095238095238095
8016470,5,B0001US7CC,"In the two days I've had this, I've watched it at least four times.  The storyline holds well, and the final twist is enough to leave even the most dedicated followers wondering, ""Why didn't I think of that?""  The characters are well-thought out and portrayed down to the letter.

Well worth watching at least once, if not more.",1195084800,4,328,4.620689655172414
8016471,2,B0001US7CC,"I rented this movie from Hollywood Video. It was a struggle not to turn it off and watch the news.  The movie was cheaply made and the acting is mediocre. It is insulting to our intelligence by trying to make us believe what is happening could be reality.
They try hard to conceal the identity of the vigilante for most of the picture.  The vigilante knows when and where anything bad is about to happen.
Our detective hero finally catches up to the vigilante just after the vigilante wipes out a bad man. The detective having the drop on this killer and instead of revealing the identity of this super person says go away.
There are many sequences just as unbelievable as this.",1109030400,8,678,4.504065040650406
