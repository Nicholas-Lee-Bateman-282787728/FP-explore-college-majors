1840346,5,B00008DZ86,"Well, today was the release date for the movie to come out on DVD.  Originally, it was supposed to be released a few months ago, but the release date was pushed back.  It was well worth the wait!
Rodney's funniest movies to date have been ""Easy Money,"" ""Meet Wally Sparks,"" and ""My 5 Wives.""
This new movie has a totally different style than the movies that I just mentioned, but it's still great.
Rodney's still the king of comedy.  I can't wait until his next movie, ""Back By Midnight,"" comes out!",1059436800,4,499,4.461538461538462

1840390,5,B00008DZ86,"Delightful rom-com which also has the distinction of being Rodney Dangerfield's last film.  It's 1/3 fairy tale, 1/3 comedy, and 1/3 musical.  The female lead, Anita DiSimone, is wonderfully beautiful as she is funny and talented.  Why isn't she in more movies??",1404777600,,262,5.190476190476191
1840391,5,B00008DZ86,"This movie was not a blockbuster with a grand premier, however it it's a great family movie with a creative and intriguing storyline. Slapstick comedy with the use of many play on words. In my book it is a classic.",1398124800,,214,4.375
1840392,5,B00008DZ86,"Great vehicle for Dangerfield to showcase his unique comedic character. Falling hopelessly in love. Going to extremes to pursue the object of his affection. Being hoodwinked by unscrupulous villains. Barely escaping complete disaster at the hands of an outraged mob of opera fans to meet his true love. (He doesn't know it yet!) It all ends hilariously well as as the Romans say - ""Omnia vincit amore."" - Love conquers all, and good triumphs after many twists and turns and set-backs over evil. Great stuff ... and it's all good!",1397347200,,529,4.888888888888889
1840393,5,B00008DZ86,For Rodney Dangerfield fans... this is a must to add to your collection. The story is even touching over and above the comedy aspect... especially to those that understand the huge importance of MUSIC in people's lives!,1388880000,,219,4.945945945945946
1840394,5,B00008DZ86,"I never heard of this movie and was glad I bought it.  Some Rodney films are great, and some not so great.  This one is classic Rodney... Great!!!",1369267200,,146,4.178571428571429
1840395,4,B00008DZ86,Rodney Dangerfield is always a laugh.  4th Tenor is a movie about a singer.  Laugh until you cry.  I love funny movies.,1361750400,,119,4.318181818181818
1840396,4,B00008DZ86,"Came across this at the library and checked it out. So glad I did! Surprisingly entertaining. OK, so Rodney at 70 or 80 being romantically involved with not one, but two, 30-something women...yawn! But, otherwise, really not a bad flick. Some laugh-out-loud goofy moments, and original in its own weird way. Watch it if you get the chance.",1357430400,,339,4.862068965517241
1840427,4,B00008DZ86,"Of course it's not a great movie! Sure it would be easy to criticize it - and many have. But it's still lots of fun to watch, so chill out! Actually, the story is quite touching. Set in the Italian countryside, it's also quite beautiful, as is the music. It is a romantic comedy. In between making you chuckle (oh come on, loosen up and laugh out loud, will ya?), there are parts that will make your heart flutter and maybe your eyes teary - if you're a romantic at heart! It's more of an romantic-fantasy opera script anyway, and a polite spoof of the famous Three Tenors' popularity.

  I think Lupo is one of Rodney Dangerfield's best roles, a perfect fit. Plus, there's the beautiful and very talented Anita De Simone (a genuine opera star), as Rosa, Lupo's beloved.  (""I love Rosa!"")  There are many other characters to enjoy, each cast well and played well.  There are moments of gentle magic here. The music is hummable. I confess that the movie even inspired me to the kitchen to indulge in some spur-of-the-moment Italian cooking, with me singing all through the process ... and I DON'T SING! My daughters thought I was crazy, my wife knows I am, but we all had fun nonetheless! All because of this little movie?  Sure, why not!  Follow up with the very romantic Don Juan deMarco, with Johnny Depp and Brando. You and your true love will be humming tunes and lighting candles for sure. It's magic!  (Now that's amore!)",1322438400,,1427,4.54296875
1840428,5,B00008DZ86,"Similar to ""Christmas in the Clouds,"" truly a simple, enjoyable, special movie.  Made us feel good.  Typical funny Mr. Dangerfield, truly worth watching.  We're going to watch it for the 2nd time this week.  Highly recommend this movie.",1265068800,,236,5.131578947368421
1840429,4,B00008DZ86,"Being a longtime Rodney Dangerfield fan, I looked forward to ""The 4th Tenor"" with both curiosity & caution. It's a cute little movie that could've been better. Rodney tries hard, but at such an advanced age, he just doesn't have much left to give. The film lacks the classic zingers Rodney delivered in such earlier films as ""Caddyshack"" & ""Easy Money"".
On the other hand, ""The 4th Tenor"" doesn't try to be those films. It's not a raucous, sophomoric comedy, but a more subtle one that aims for smiles & chuckles instead of belly laughs. It works as a sort of Italian fairy tale, or one man's quest for love. It also operates on the romantic notion that the way to a woman's heart is through song.
But Rodney's character of a sincere but lovestruck restaurant owner is so endearing that you're with him all the way...even through a rather lukewarm vehicle. He does get able support from a fine cast: Robert Davi, Charles Fleischer (yes, the voice of Roger Rabbit), and Hamilton Camp, to name a few.
So long, Rodney. Whether your films were terrific or mediocre, you still made me laugh. Thanks for so much! : )",1251849600,5,1110,4.582914572864322
1840430,5,B00008DZ86,"I bought this movie not knowing anything about it.
To my surprise I found it to be very fun, a good comedy.
No it's not a big blockbuster, but it's Rodney doin what he does best.
I would say this movie is worth it to buy!!
I would rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!",1192233600,,263,3.7142857142857144
1840431,2,B00008DZ86,"A very odd film, and the other reviewers are right that Rodney was too old for the part.  However, lovers of opera may actually enjoy this flick for the singing (other than Rodney when he's not using the magic wine) and the respectful treatment of the world's greatest art form.

I looks like Rodney or his producers actually knew something about the art of singing and liked it.  Rosa, her mother and father and the other 'real singers' all are portrayed to sing beautifully, naturally, and sincerely. There's not a hint of the sarcasm and caricature that the typical Hollywood cultural ignorance could have applied.  The movie accepts the thesis that bel canto singing is worthwhile on its own terms, and not just as a celebrity vehicle for the Three Tenors, or an art form to be marginalized by the mainstream of pop culture.

Although I'm sure he didn't set out to make a music education film, Bravo Rodney!",1191456000,3,911,4.70440251572327
1840432,5,B00008DZ86,"Once again, I read the reviews on-line before purchasing a movie and end up enjoying the movie much more than I expected to.  ""The 4th Tenor"" is not like one of Rodney Dangerfield's older movies, all which I have seen by the way, and shouldn't be compared to any of them.  But this happens to be a nice change up for him.

It was a very cute and well made movie and there's hardly any sign of the 'brawdy' Rodney for previous movies, although many of the jokes are pretty hilarious!  It made me appreciate and respect the late great Rodney even more than I already do!

Also, the supporting cast was very funny also!  When was the last time you've seen Charlie Fletcher ('Who Framed Roger Rabbit', and tv show 'Freddie') take on a more supporting role?  Or seen 'all around' tough ass Robert Davi ('Profiler' and 'License To Kill') dive for cover in a tub full of water and rose petals?

If you have a quite Saturday with nothing to do, rent or purchase ""The 4th Tenor"".  You won't be disappointed.",1139702400,4,998,4.409836065573771
1840433,5,B00008DZ86,"The movie was made not that long after 9/11 and the beginning of the Iraq War. 9/11 was still on many people's minds and the classical ""no respect"" Rodney joke would have been viewed as ""inappropriate"" during that era. It is also interesting to note that before the Iraq War, France was considered the European nation of romance where all the romantic comedies were filmed, with Paris and the Eiffel tower as wonderful backgrounds. However, during the era when this movie was made, France decided not to support the US in the War and there was anti-France sentiment as a result. Well, guess what happened. Italy became the European nation of romance. Hence, now we have an Italian background for a romantic comedy

The movie was a romantic comedy with a bit more slapstick. The very fact that the romance was between Dangerfield who was in his eighties and a thirty-something woman, young enough to be his granddaughter was in itself funny. It was so odd, it was hilarious. OK, the usual ""no respect"" jokes weren't in this movie but the jokes he DID have were a riot.

This movie was a very odd classic, both in that it was hilarious even without Dangerfield's usual ""no respect"" jokes and for another important reason. It would be Dangerfield's last movie before he had his last heart surgery. Dangerfield would later die of complications due to that surgery which makes ""The Fourth Tenor"" his very last movie. One day this movie will be a collector's item.",1119916800,4,1458,4.7362204724409445
1840434,2,B00008DZ86,"This could have been a nice little movie; it almost is. The plot is blissfully uncomplicated, much like a Marx Brother's film, but even at his oldest, Groucho never seemed as old as Rodney does in this DVD. The idea of going to the ends of the earth to win the love of your lady is timeless. But with a thirty-something leading lady and an eighty-something leading man, searching for your Viagara and your teeth would seem like a more realistic quest. I'm especially disappointed that there were no memorable ""Rodney lines"" like in Caddy Shack - ""Oh that's the worst looking hat I ever saw ... looks good on YOU though."" A sweethearted, non-wise cracking Rodney didn't work for me. Honestly, I feel bad not loving this movie. I am a Rodney fan - have all of his records (yup, on vinyl), DVDs and CDs too.  I have seen him live and use his lines all day long - ""I went to the doctor, I said doc, when I wake up and I look in the mirror, I wanna throw up, what's wrong with me? he said, I don't know, but your eyesight's perfect!""  But in this film he was mis-cast.  Picture Billy Crystal in the lead and you know what I mean. Anyway, if you love Rodney, maybe you shouldn't see this movie. It's just too painful. I had to go watch Caddy Shack a couple of times to get over it.
I originally wrote this review back in June of 2004 - Rodney was still with us and making those around him laugh. He's gone and there will never be another,",1087257600,24,1432,4.218978102189781
1840435,5,B00008DZ86,"Rodney travels to italy to learn how to sing. and meets a charming lady. I tell you, this movie is an adventure. and in this movie, not even the horses show Rodney any respect, like when he calls for the horse, and the horse run away.
and Rodney actally slaps Robert Davi around, can you imagen that? Rodney brawling like Bud Spencer in the kitchen, and to top that, Davi ends up getting suffocated between Annabella Gurwitch legs.
This movie will bring you more than a couple of laughs, its a charming and well done flick, with alote of well known faces, its just a real treat. with a little magic. it has all the ingredients for the perfect movie. it has comedy, romance, wine, women and song, a little action and actually some horror. (you who has seen the movie knows what i'm talking about)
Bravissimo!!",1065830400,5,808,4.503401360544218
1840436,4,B00008DZ86,"Rodney Dangerfield plays Lupo, the owner of the Serenade Cafe, a very successful Italian restaurant that features singing waiters.  Rodney is in his eighties but still manages to fire off some great jokes.  When a couple asks him how he keeps his weight down, he replies, ""At my age, everything is down!""  When he asks an overweight couple how they're enjoying their meal, they grunt their approval while they keep on eating.  He warns them, ""When you get to the white part, that's the plate!""  Lupo hires a female opera singer to entertain the diners.  When Gina sings, Lupo falls madly in love with her.  Gina (Annabelle Gurwitch) tells him that she can only love a man who is a great opera singer.  Since Lupo can't carry a tune, he flies to Italy to be trained as an opera singer by Vincenzo (Richard Libertini).  No matter how bad he sings, Vincenzo keeps encouraging him to keep taking lessons so he can keep taking Lupo's money.  Vincenzo persuades the local opera company to let Lupo sing.  Lupo is so bad that the villagers chase him off the stage and down the streets.  The scene of him being chased by villagers carrying torches is reminiscent of a similar scene from Frankenstein!

Lupo finally reaches a dock, finds a rowboat and paddles his way to safety.  The next morning, he washes ashore on a pond and is found by a young boy, who calls his mother.  She is the beautiful Rosa (Anita De Simone) who takes pity on Lupo and takes him home.  There we meet her Mamma (Elsa Raven) and Papa (Hamilton Camp) who also take a liking to Lupo.  Lupo listens to the family singing as they work, and can't believe how great they all sing.  Rosa lets him in on their family secret.  The grapes they grow produces a magical wine, and anyone who drinks the wine becomes a great singer!  Lupo returns to America and, with a constant supply of wine, becomes the opera singing sensation Lupo the Great!  Unfortunately, Gina still wants no part of him.  When Lupo discovers that Rosa is going through with an arranged marriage to Marcello (Vincent Schiavelli), a man she doesn't love, he flies back to Italy to stop the wedding.  Lupo's attempts to get to the church on time, first on horseback and then with the help of the police, outdoes Dustin Hoffman's similar scene in The Graduate!  Lupo arrives just in time to stop the wedding and profess his love for Rosa.

This movie has a more leisurely pace than Rodney's previous films, with less one-liners and more character development.  The pastoral scenes in Italy are visually beautiful and give the movie a magical quality.  On the other hand, the scenes of the restaurant and surrounding streets in New York City have the look of a soundstage in a movie studio.  Considering the peak of the Three Tenors' popularity and Rodney Dangerfield's age, I'm sure this movie would have found a much bigger audience if it had been made several years ago.",1059955200,4,2897,4.616438356164384
