8344780,5,B001URA5XO,Kong The Animated Series is the Best Animated Monster Action Show Series since Godzilla The Animated Series. Most of those episodes that my only son liked was seeing some other Animals. Including some Prehistoric Animals such as the Dinosaurs that inhabit Kong Island. One of his favorite Cretaceous Periods Dinosaurs are the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Pachycephalosaurus that featured in some of those episodes. He was also surprised that the heros and villains merged with some different animal species with a device called a Cyberlink. Sometimes the creatures are in regular appearances when merged with a human and sometimes the creatures are in a Humanoid look when merged with a human.,1517875200,,690,5.225225225225225

8344784,4,B001URA5XO,"I remember seeing this series years ago when it aired on tv. I didn't think much of it then, but as grew older, I came to have an interest, although I didn't think I had much chance of getting it until now. When I found this set, I had to get it and I'm glad I did. It features such action and adventure in an animated way. Kong has been one my favorite monsters for years. I'm glad an animated series about him was created. I think this series will be of interest to other who enjoy Kong. It will be worth it and I don't they will be disappionted.",1423180800,,548,3.9909090909090907

8344786,4,B001URA5XO,If you love the good old Fox Kids days then you should definitely purchase this and watch this especially if you are a fan of King Kong! This is the entire series plus one of the animated films so it's totally worth the money. All you would need then is Kong: King Of Atlantis then you have the entire series.,1376784000,,309,4.166666666666667
