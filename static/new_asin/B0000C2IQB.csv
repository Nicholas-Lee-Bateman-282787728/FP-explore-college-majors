1910295,5,B0000C2IQB,"Of course I'm going to buy it!  This has got to be the first great cartoon of the 21st century, and I'm one of the adult ""Spongebob underground.""  That is, the adults out there who watch this show but are afraid to tell any of their adult friends for fear of being laughed at.
Now, it's a bit annoying that after collecting several Spongebob DVD's, they come out with this collection so soon.  I'm getting to where I'll never buy individual DVDs of a TV series again, because this happens over and over.  If a show is phenominally popular, ignore everything untill the season-at-a-time box sets come out.  I've got the message.
Now, how about the folks at Nick releasing some of the earlier classics.  How about a Ren and Stimpy box set, or a Rocko's Modern Life box set?  What fun those would be!",1063843200,26,797,4.455172413793103
1910296,5,B0000C2IQB,"Why didn't they do this in the first place!!!!??????
I am a huge fan of the show. But I am pretty mad at Nick right now for first releasing sponge DVDs with the episodes all mixed up and not according to season, and they decide NOW, after seven (the seventh actually comes out on 9/30) of these DVDs, to release it according to season. I own the first six, and now I'll have to sell them used. What a waste of money. Sorta. The Season One set will be a great buy. It's not my favorite season (2, represent!), but it's great all the same. Here's the special features!
90 minutes of extras, INCLDUING:
-The Origin of Spongebob SquarePants
-Recollection from the 1st season crew featurette
-Everybody's talking: The voices of Spongebob SquarePants
-The Bikini Bottoms Up Tour
-In the key of Sea: Krusty Krab Karaoke
-Audio Commentary with Cast discussing 2 of their favorite episodes
-3 Music Videos
Sounds like a whoppin' good DVD set. Now I gotta go clean the disks of the old DVDs and ship 'em off to eBay. Buh-bye!
Also, watch for the SpongeBob movie on November 19, 2004. And stay tuned to Nick for new SpongeBob episodes next year, including ""SpongeBob B.C."" (Before Comedy), aka ""Ugh"". It's a half-hour Patchy special in which SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward discover fire. Oh, great, I sound like a news reporter guy.",1062806400,24,1324,4.662393162393163
1910297,5,B0000C2IQB,"Here comes the first season of the cult smash that's fun for kids and adults alike.

1910299,5,B0000C2IQB,"Along with the Oresteia, Beethoven's 5th, and the Sistine Chapel this piece of craftsmanship is one of the greatest masterpieces of western civilization. It is full of themes that ring true across time and cultures alike. The sheer amount of artistry that went into forging this timeless tale of this unforgettable yellow sponge is unfathomable. This is why Stephen Hillenburg will be remembered with greats such as Plato, Shakespeare, and Goethe as those luminaries who were able, unlike so many others, to transcend the filth of this world and reach towards the eternal forms of true art. In fact I cannot recall a single piece with such rich character development and novel plot-lines as the opening season of Spongebob Squarepants. In closing I would say to all those contemplating whether Spongebob is worth their time: THIS SHOW WILL CAUSE YOU TO EXPERIENCE YOUR HUMANITY IN WAYS YOU COULD NEVER BEFORE COMPREHEND...

I have to say that 60% of the best episodes are contained within the first 2 seasons. Season 3 ,4 and 5 had a good number of quality episodes, but for me the show took a big drop starting in season 6 and I stopped watching.
Gross out violence and more  jerkishness on the part of characters like Patrick turned me off",1495584000,3,377,4.222222222222222

1910499,5,B0000C2IQB,"SpongeBob SquarePants Season 1 is only pure, silly entertainment. Do not expect it to be educational public television. With that being said we baby sit our 1 1/2 year old and he loves it. One of the first few words he spoke was ""Ponge Bob"".

We watch it on both from the Nickelodeon App our Apple TV and our Amazon Fire Stick. Both have merits. Show on the Apple TV are shown in full HD screen with a great picture, BUT there are Nickelodeon commercials. Spongebob on our Amazon Firestick play episodes back to back without commercials, BUT the picture is in standard definition with the black bars on the sides of the screen.

We've watched every episode so many times that we've memorized almost every line and its obvious that the writers anticipate some of the humor going over the children's heads and is aimed at the adults watching with them.

As a final note, when my wife worked at a Christian School this was one of the forbidden cartoons to show at after school. If you have to judge that type of thing, watch the episode at night before watching it with your child. Don't ban an entire series because of one or two scenes.",1485475200,3,1135,4.473429951690822

1911660,5,B0000C2IQB,"Was dragged kicking and screaming to the TV while being forced to watch with my grand kids.  Pleasantly surprised and after the first few episodes I became a fan.  Very clever.  Primary characters' expressive animation is well done (and a little over the top).  Many references to old TV shows about which kids would have no clue.  Maybe that's a nod for adults dragged kicking and screaming to the TV.  It's fun to exercise the kids' brains with obvious impossibilities - like underwater swimming pools and fires.  Was nice to genuinely laugh at a TV show for a change. No gutter talk, innuendos, political propaganda or a phony laugh track.  Quite refreshing, actually.  I hope future episodes don't succumb to the usual Hollywood tilt.",1471392000,,738,4.887096774193548

The main character is Spongebob.  He does a lot of weird things! And cries a lot.  If you like humor you should watch this show.  On a scale of 1-10 it is a 10!

1913031,5,B0000C2IQB,"Somewhere in Europe, the German DVD re-release of SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season does live up to its name. Let's explain that.

In North America the Region 1 DVD releases doesn't have the very first episode called Help Wanted, because it contains an oldies song (Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight) by Tiny Tim. That episode can only be found on 10 Happiest Moments DVD, and The First 100 Episodes Box Set.
However, the German release does have very first episode which makes their set the most definitive release in the world and in English and German dubbed[].
Alongside all of the episodes from the first season, the DVD authoring playback of these episodes isn't marathon mode but feels just like broadcast version. So what's the point? It's SpongeBob as we all know it, NTSC or not!

Otherwise,  I think most of the episodes are okay, Sponge Bob in general just annoys me since he enjoys watching it SO much.  It is definitely his most favorite cartoon, so that is why I haven't cut it out of the programs he watches altogether.

But Paul Tibbit jacked up the series since the first movie and recently Vincent Walter is show runner since the terrible so called ""second"" movie.

1914609,5,B0000C2IQB,"In 1999 Nickelodeon debuted ""SpongeBob Squarepants"" and to this day it still is entertaining and funny. Originally intended to be called ""SpongeBoy Ahoy!"", it tells the story of a manmade sponge, his friends and various misadventures in Bikini Bottom. The first season contains many favorites including ""Ripped Pants"", ""Suds"" and my personal favorite ""Jellyfishing"". The only complaint one would make is the original pilot episode isn't included due to licensing issues. But none the less this is a nice DVD set, it includes select episode commentary, and storyboards.

1914696,5,B0000C2IQB,"If you've never seen Sponge Bob nor understood the phrase, ""Pinky Up!"" then you are in for a treat.  This classic first season introduces you to the outrageous and zany deep sea denizens of Bikini Bottom which center around the crazy adventures of the main character Sponge Bob, a lowly, fry cook in a burger joint called the Krusty Krab owned by a crustacean obviously named Mr. Krab and his fellow employee and neighbor, Squidword.  There are other characters essential to success of this cartoon such as Patrick the Starfish, Sandy the Squirrel, Mrs Puff the Boat Driving School teacher, Plankton, the rival fast food restaurant owner aptly named by his generous stature and Davy Jones, the Ghost Pirate Captain.  It is just the ridiculousness and silliness of the show that adds to its charm and success.  Adults should watch first to gauge the humour which can sometimes be a little much for Pre K but all other ages are fine.",1425513600,,931,4.763975155279503

-They don't even use blasphemy or say any curse word in the whole show, only bad words a 4yr old would say.

-And this show is meant to be crude and not educating that you can laugh out your brains 'til they melt, when you don't want to think.

It talked about as kids, we identify with Spongebob and think Squidward is a j***.  As we get older, we tend to think Spongebob and his mooching friend Patrick are kind of the j***s, and Squidward is a little more sympathetic (though actually, Squidward is tiresome in his own way too).  Spongebob represents the injustices a kid feels in an adult world.  The other characters are common annoyances we know in the adult world--the guy who is obsessed with money, the cool friend who is fun but is a deadbeat and hangs around in his underwear all the time, the pseudo-intellectual who thinks he is better than everybody, the country girl who can beat all the boys chops, etc.",1400025600,,846,4.5394736842105265

1915507,5,B0000C2IQB,"In honor of SpongeBob's 15th anniversary in 2014, here's my review of the very first season of one of my all-time fave Nicktoons, besides Digimon and Rugrats. Due to legal confusion, the original pilot episode ""Help Wanted"" isn't in this set, neither in the original bulky packaging nor in the new single-case packaging, but they are together in The First 100 Episodes set. However, its 2 partner episodes remain, along with the other 19 pairs of episodes! This set has a huge amount of bonus features, more than any other season set, most of which are on the last disc. (Help Wanted is a bonus episode in season 3's set!) From SpongeBob getting his job at the Krusty Krab, to he and Patrick making friends with Sandy Cheeks, to the start of the Mermaidman and Barnacleboy saga, to SpongeBob's first Halloween classics (Scaredy Pants and I Was A Teenage Gary) and the only official Valentine special, and his April Fools' bonanza, and Squidward's bold glimpses of the future and distant past (and in another dimension), it's (almost) all here in glorious Traditional-cel animation! Season 1 was the only season of SpongeBob to be made this way. Just as Digimon did, SpongeBob was slowly-but-surely gaining popularity when both shows were brand-new in 1999 and 2000. In SpongeBob's case, his universal appeal was catching on to kids and grownups alike, all over the world, just like Mickey Mouse himself! The only thing that bugs me about this set is the picture seems to lag in many episodes compared to when they were seen on Nick, before they sped up most of the episodes of all 9 seasons for more commercial time! Steve Hillenburg created something pretty darn special all right, being a former crew member of Rocko's Modern Life, just like Tom Kenny and Mr. Lawrence were in those days. In fact, in ""The Chaperone"", Tom Kenny used his Heffer Wolfe voice on one of the dancers after kicking out SpongeBob and Pearl from the prom. If you wanna see how the most popular Nicktoon in history got his start, season 1 is a great choice, and the First 100 Episodes set is even greater, if it weren't being priced so high in 2014! Alongside Mickey, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, Popeye, the Pink Panther, Winnie the Pooh, and lots of other all-time greats in toon history, SpongeBob truly is among them! And season 1 will get you started despite not having its pilot episode in this set.",1392854400,23,2379,4.721153846153846

1915545,4,B0000C2IQB,"My daughter watched this program. I will give my response and then hers. Let's see how they differ. I will give the star rating as per my daughter's opinion as that is the target market here.

Mom:  I have been subjected to SpongeBob for many, many years. I have an 18 year old and 14 year old who watched this program and now a 6 year old that enjoys this program. I would love to say that I look forward to viewing this program, but at best I am impartial as you see, far better children's programming from 15 years ago has gone away while SpongeBob still goes on. I never dreamed I would after years of watching children's programming still be enduring this cartoon. I do not understand it, except that SpongeBob is heavily marketed to children. The graphics and colors are bright, and there do seem to be some morals and lessons that kids will learn from. The story line is sometimes weird and sometimes funny. A redeeming quality of the program is that the adult humor in it is (mostly) not inappropriate nor do they talk about sex in every single sentence or put other people down. Except SpongeBob of course. Who always comes back with a smile and ends up on top of the situation. Perhaps that is the secret and why it appeals to small children. SpongeBob does appear to have the mental and emotional capacity of a 6 year old. He trusts everyone (and he should not), he has many friends (he believes), and he is really great at everything (no he is not), and all the while he goes along with his plan with great intentions oblivious to the entire world falling apart around him. It also ends on a happy note within about 23 minutes which is just enough time to have an after school snack.
Daughter:  I love SpongeBob and Patrick.",1391126400,,1736,4.41875
1915546,5,B0000C2IQB,"SpongeBob Squarepants is much more than a cartoon...he is a cultural icon.

1915673,3,B0000C2IQB,"Sponge Bob is a hit or miss with me.  Some episodes are funny and appropriate for kids, others are just flat out gross or are really kind of too old for the targeted viewers (Y7 rated).  Examples of that are:  ""Bubblestand"" where SpongeBob open's his version of a Lemonade Stand and takes request of what the customer would like to seen made from bubbles.....then tries to teach Squidward how to do it after several failed attempts.  Its funny and shows how to help other's who need help and encouraging when things aren't working out for the one having trouble.  Now ""The Suds"" is one that is gross and while tries to show a good moral, still was very gross.  SpongeBob is sick but is scared by Patrick to go to the Doctor's and just ends up getting sicker and sicker (Suds are what we call a common cold) so there are a handful of gross parts that personally I find to be a little much.

There are characters for everyone to relate to or like:
SpongeBob is the carefree, hardworking, loyal friend and employee who wants to do everything he can to help people and just enjoy everyday to the fullest.
Patrick Star is the loyal friend who is well not the brightest light bulb but is another carefree loyal friend.  He sometimes tries to be helpful but ends up making more of a mess our of the situation.
Gary is SpongeBob's faithful companion.  Instead of a dog or cat, he is a snail, and has the attitude of Garfield with dealing with John or Odie.  Very funny character.
Mr. Krabs who is SpongeBob's boss of ""The Krusty Krab"" loves his money and will do anything to make a penny but all in all has a good heart.....if he hasn't sold it for more money.
Plankton who is Mr. Krabs arch enemy run the rival restaurant ""The Chum Bucket"" is always trying to steal the precious formula to Mr. Krabs famous burger.
Finally there is Squidward, the grumpy, dry humor person who always dreams of his big life that he'll have but yet is still stuck at the ""Krusty Krab"" day dreaming of bigger things.  He has his moments of caring but does his best not to show it.",1382918400,,2053,4.3905013192612135
1915674,5,B0000C2IQB,"To many adults, Spongebob may seem kinda silly, but many times this 'toon delivers some life's lessons on how to treat or not treat people you come in contact with. Spongebob's buddy, Patrick, is kind of a nut, but they are buddies forever (BFF). Squidward also learns a few lessons along the way. Sit with your kids and enjoy; teach when something is not exactly right. Parents should be involved in what their kids are watching. Be a sponge buddy!",1382745600,,449,4.625

We feel that after about the 3rd season it just became annoyingly stupid (I know some think they're all like that). I feel that the writers ran out of really good material or gave up trying.

DO NOT WATCH THIS PAST THE 3rd SEASON!

I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT WATCH THIS PAST THE 3rd SEASON!

Please, for the love of a god you worship/don't, save yourself. Save your children. Save humanity.

Well Mr./Ms./Mrs. High-and-mighty. Excuse me for saving precious hours of your life that can be spent laughing at flashbacks of ""Wormy"" or ""Doodle-bob"".

""B-b-but Johnny Depp makes a guest appearance!""

Yeah! He says 3 words the entire episode!

Look, just trust me on this one. For once in your life TRUST A COMPLETE STRANGER THAT SHOULD HAVE A PHD IN SPONGEBOB.

episodes are amusing and certainly will be fun for the children.

For me, this is definitely the type of media I would want to see using Amazon's Prime Instant

1915925,5,B0000C2IQB,"Season 1 had very well crafted stories compared to the ""throw random junk at screen"" that you get from the more recent Sponge Bob episodes. All the classic gags start here.

Not to sound like a crazy person, but I watched this show from the start, and in the early episodes Sponge Bob actually had a personality. He was actually very insecure and tried to overcompensate for it by being very meticulous in everything he did. After a while they just turned SpongeBob and Patrick into insane toddlers instead of 20 somethings that missed the boat of life.

1915960,5,B0000C2IQB,"So as a 34-year old guy, I have resigned myself to having one guilty pleasure and that's Spongebob Squarepants.  I find this cartoon to be just plain funny.  The characters are amusingly outlandish, the stories are (mostly) mindless, and the animation is classic ""kid-animation"".  Whenever I'm in need of a good laugh or some levity, Spongebob never fails to deliver.  I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons!  Who can I recommend this to?  No one in particular, as the crazy humor may not appeal to everyone.  I can just recommend that you try watching a couple of episodes and see if it's your cup of tea.  I didn't imagine I would like it as much as I do, but now that I've been exposed to it I have to say it is one of the funniest shows I have seen.

1915962,5,B0000C2IQB,"Although on the outside I think I appear to be a bit like Squidward: disgruntled and grouchy. Deep inside lives a Spongebob: enthusiastic, happy and a friend to all.
This is great stuff. Like Rocky and Bullwinkle, another favorite, there's plenty of entertaining for all, adult and kid. I marvel at how they write funny stuff that goes over a kid's head without having the kid notice it.
An absurd ocean world and a believable fish based community in Bikini Bottom. Your worst job memories cheerfully endured by a Sponge who lives to be employee of the month.
Being inside Spongebob's Pineapple is like being in Pee Wee's playhouse. It's the perfect dreamhome for a grownup who's  still a child but an excellent housekeeper.
Powerful friend messages. With a devoted Patrick and a strong independent Cindy the squirrel as Sponge Bob's inter species romantic interest.

The spongebob series was pretty cool right from the 1st episodes in '99 up until 2005. The series remained pretty entertaining right up until the producers decided to change spongebob's voice a bit with an almost twisted gay version which coincidentally, stirred up some controversy of whether the producers were attempting to bring spongebob out of the closet. Quite frankly, such matters don't concern me at all. But i'd say that spongebob was special only from '99 to '05.

Still, as a cartoon\kid pop culture expert, this show is not to be missed. It's about a charmingly, childishly innocent sea sponge shaped like a kitchen sponge with a job as a fry cook. He deals with both kid issues like being scared of the dark and more grown-up issues like meeting your deadline when given an assignment from an elder. He's friends with a variety of aquatic life and even a squirrel from Texas (Sandy).

Episodes Include:

Reef Blower - A Short Including Spongebob Anoying Squidward With A Brand New Reef Blower. For The First Ever Short Episode For Spongebob (Though Not The Best) It's A Great Short and The Humor Happens With No Words Just Random Gags Happening With Nothing Except Noises With A Reef Blower. (5/5)

Tea At The Treedome - The First Episode Involving Sandy, In Which Spongebob Is Invied To Sandy's Home Which Is A Dome With Air and Spongebob Starts Having A Hard Time Breathing.

1916022,1,B0000C2IQB,"I've written Spongebob Squarepants on [..] to see how much this show sucks, Made by Bowlinguy119). Yep, this show has everything, the humor is major annoyance and abysmal, so annoying, its bad!! The acting they played can be annoying at sometimes. the characters in this are extremely annoying, Spongebob however, is an idiot that he is always happy and he's getting on my nerves,Patrick is another one to these characters that hangs around with Spongebob a lot, Squidward is just a grouchy, grumpy neighbor who does not hang around with Spongebob and Patrick.

I really don't understand why this crap is so popular. Maybe because of the characters interact with each other or the humor. I used to watch Spongebob up until 2006. When I watch it now, I soon realize how stupid this show is. Now there making new episodes on Nick, it keeps getting stupider by the minute! Now Nickelodeon is not the same anymore with shows like this.

All of that annoyance drives me crazy, If you want to watch a good, awesome TV show, then go watch Beyblade, Robot Wars, South Park, and Battlebots! But.. If you want to watch a show that is so boring, lame, awful, and horrible, then Spongebob is for you.

I didn't care for it at all.

It was an abomination.

Avoid it at all costs!!

This show is pathetic.

1916038,4,B0000C2IQB,"...at least 3 times a week, no joke!!

They live for Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff.

But I don't and can't blame them really; Spongebob is a catch and from time to time, the show itself is actually quite funny. It all takes place at Bikini Bottom, a town underwater, away from most sharks and beneath all the humans who dwell on earth. From time to time, Spongebob and Patrick make it a rare habit to come up out of the water, and take a looksee around. Immediately, they puff up like Mrs. Puff, Spongebob's driving teacher. He never learns how to drive successfully either. He's no good in that department, and should stick to the Krabby Patties!

Anyway, I'm gonna describe and then rate all of the characters and then rate a few aspects of the actual film:

Spongebob Squarepants: Very silly, upbeat and so nice to everyone that is nice to him. Even if you're mean, he tries to see the good in everyone. My second favorite character. A

Patrick Star: Super goofy and kinda spaced out, he's basically Spongebob's right-hand man. His personality, while goofy, consists of being nice to Spongebob but he tends to have an anger spout here and there. An OK character. B-

Squidward Tentacles: Another keeper, character-wise. He's the moody, selfish and very negative critic of the series. Many enjoy his company, especially Spongebob, but funnily, Squidward doesn't feel half the happiness when around the yellow sponge. He'd rather have his hands around his neck, doing the unthinkable. B+

Mr. Krabs: Very work-oriented, and a decent man who tries to instill the work ethic into Spongebob and Squidward also. Spongebob follows, and Squidward carries on, as if Mr. Krabs said NOTHING. Not one of my favorite characters. C-

Gary: My absolute favorite! I can't really pinpoint a true-blue personality to him, but he makes cat sounds, is usually quiet, which leads me to believe that he's an introvert as opposed to an extrovert, and loves Spongebob till the ends of the sandy ends of Bikini Bottom. A+

Pearl Krabs: The whiny, big-headed whale-daughter of Mr. Krabs. She's so ridiculously spoiled that I would slap her if I was an imaginary fish, residing in Bikini Bottom. She's not a bad character, and is usually super-dramatic. B+

Sandy: Level-headed and sweet, Sandy is nearly as friendly as Spongebob. Get on her bad side though, and she's unafraid to show you a piece of her mind! B

Mrs. Puff: She holds one of the absolute worst jobs in Bikini Bottom; trying to teach the unteachable Spongebob to drive! She goes crazy every time she spends 5 minutes with him, and for very, very good reason. A-

Probably my most favorite characters are SpongeBob and Patrick. The two of them can be pretty stupid at times, but that's what makes the whole cartoon so dang funny. And there are a few thematic elements here and there, but nothing too bad. I recommend this DVD to anyone who's a family person, and a big fan of cartoons.",1158019200,5,594,4.6571428571428575
1916055,5,B0000C2IQB,"I have to say, that I am unpleased with the lack of the pilot episode. But anyhow, we do end up getting some of the most classic and memorable episodes of Spongebob! The following are short reviews in which I will rate episodes individually.

Reef Blower: (4/5) Technically the second episode. The characters look a little more primitive than in subsequent episodes, which makes it interesting. Good humor!

Tea at the Teadome: (5/5) Exceptionally funny!

Bubblestand: (2/5) One of the weaker episodes of the season.

Ripped Pants: (5/5) Arguably a television classic!

Jellyfishing: (5/5) Very strong episode. Extremely hilarious!

Plankton!: (4/5) Introduces Plankton.

Naughty Nautical Neighbors: (5/5) Like ""Jellyfishing"", this is just HILARIOUS!

Boating School: (5/5) Bob and Patrick's mastermind plan comes to bite back at them!

Pizza Delivery: (5/5) A very unique episode in the whole series.

Home Sweet Pineapple: (4/5) Funny! Main point of interest is that we get to see Bob's parents.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy: (5/5) Purely a classical episode!

Pickles: (3/5) This one is interesting, but not exceptional.

Hall Monitor: (3/5) It's okay.

Jellyfish Jam: (5/5) Silly and Funny!

Sandy's Rocket: (3/5) Average.

Squeaky Boots: (4/5) Above Average.

Nature Pants: (5/5) Classic, Funny, and has a good resolution.

Opposite Day: (2/5) In my opinion, this episode is weak.

Culture Shock: (4/5) Another Classic!

F.U.N.: (5/5) Very silly and f.u.n.n.y!

MuscleBob BuffPants: (4/5) Strong storyline.

Squidward, the Unfriendly Ghost: (4/5) Again, strong storyline, but not greatly funny.

The Chaperone: (5/5) Very funny. Good writing on this episode.

Employee of the Month: (4/5) Yet again ... good storyline, but not that funny.

Scaredy Pants:(5/5)HILARIOUS ENDING! My favorite of the season!

I Was a Teenage Gary: (5/5) As funny as its predecessor!

SB-129: (5/5) Exceptional storyline and humor! Superb animation, also.

Karate Choppers: (4/5) Very good writing and directing.

Sleepy Time: (5/5) Classical episode!

Suds: (4/5) Good laughs from Patrick's antics!

Valentine's Day: (3/5) Average; but still worth seeing.

The Paper: (2/5) Too over-the-top; like ""Bubblestand"".

Arrgh!: (5/5) Deserves a '5' for the storyline!

Rock Bottom: (2/5) Definatly not a better one. The very end is funny, though.

Texas: (4/5) Good storyline; good writing.

Walking Small: (4/5) Plankton is at his best thus far in the series.

Fools in April: (5/5) This begins to sum up the season with hilarious antics!

Neptune's Spatula: (5/5) Neptune's reactions are HILARIOUS! A classic episode.

Hooky: (3/5) Honestly, could have been better. The only truly funny part is the ironic ending.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy II: (5/5) A worthy sequal to the first, and a worthy episode to sum up the season! I was very pleased with this one.",1153353600,10,2836,5.429885057471265

OK, so I'm 41, but yeah there is a kid in there somewhere ... and he loves this stuff. Which is the beauty & intelligence of Spongebob, because it works both as serious fun for kids and adults.

  So, then I found myself making it home from work in time to see new episodes ... and, finally, buying the DVDs of the first season. I have to really, really, really like something to get the DVD.

  Turns out, this set is great value, with a bunch of episodes plus extra features on three discs.

  It's just great stuff ... the characters, the animation, the stupid jokes, the scenarios. And what makes the whole deal is Spongebob himself, by turns nerdy, mischevious, funny, lost, brilliant, incompetent, etc. You get the picture: Complex.

  Spongebob is my new adult test: If you don't like it, it's time to quit taking yourself so seriously and lighten up.

  I generally find I don't like wild pop culture successes. I'm usually disappointed when I give into the marketing. Spongebob is a huge exception--it lives up to the hype. And the story behind how it happened -- told in one of the bonus features on this DVD set -- is just great. It reaffirms my belief that you generally can't set out some cynical masterplan to be truly successful: Ya gotta do what you love, and everything else will follow.

SEA BEAR

SQUIDWARD THE UNFRIENDLY GHOST

TEXAS

JELLYFISH JAM

HOOKS

 and

SUDS

Great lesson, Mr. Krabs! He deserved to be hooked in his (u watch it 4 urself!) One thing I can't hold back, is that Squidward was controling the HOOK!

Squidward was wearing his hat upside down!(Well the Sea Bear did it upside down)And Squidward couldn't possibly have an underwear, because he has NO PANTS!

Were the Jellyfish still alive after MR. KRABS sucked they're juice out with that big OLE-machine?

The Texas song even made me cry!

What they didn't do to prevent Sandy from taking SB to the doctor for his Suds!

Squidward didn't actually have the whole ""Patrick & SB bringing the coffin to him, in his mind, (It was sweet of them, though!)""

This season rocked me up. I was humming the tone of the CAMPIRE SONG in my bed!

Thanks for reading, hope I advised u enough to go and BUY THIS DVD!!!",1112400000,4,1295,4.614035087719298
1916070,5,B0000C2IQB,"Spongebob Squarepants, along with Fairly Odd Parents, is the best kid's animated series on TV today.  It has the shameless silliness for the kids and the witty cracks and well-evolved characters that adults can appreciate.  I am 30 and have watched these episodes numerous times and will continue to.  They are just funny.  I can relate to Squidward Tentacles' surly ""whatever"" attitude towards life.  The money-grubbing Mr. Krabs is hilarious as well as Spongebob's dim-witted friend, Patrick.  Plankton has to be funniest villain on television today!  Anyway, this series was spot on from the beginning to which the following first season episodes attest:

Disc 1:

Reef Blower: Contrary to previous reviews, ""Help Wanted"" (where Spongebob is hired at the Krusty Krab) is not included on this disc. The first episode shown here is the one where Spongebob (SB) and Patrick interrupt Squidward's quiet time by demonstrating the fun one can have with reef blowers.

Tea at the Teadome: Sandy Cheeks the Squirrel is introduced and Patrick gives SB misguided advice on how to handle himself in Sandy's air-filled home.

Bubblestand: Squidward ends up paying for bubble blowing lessons from SB.

Ripped Pants: A beach mishap gives SB his 15 minutes of fame which he soon abuses.

Jellyfishing: SB and Patrick want to give Squidward (in a full body cast after a bicycle accident) his ""best day ever"" by taking him jellyfishing.

Plankton: [w/ commentary] Introduces Mr. Krab's arch-enemy who tries to take-over SB's brain.

Naughty Nautical Neighbors: Squidward thinks its hilarious to break up SB and Patrick's friendship until they look to him to fill their friendship void.

Boating School: Patrick tries to radio instructions to SB so he will finally pass his boating test.

Pizza Delivery:  The Krusty Krab doesn't serve pizza. . . or does it?  For money, Mr. Krabs will have his crew deliver anything.

Home Sweet Pineapple: Nematodes destroy SB's pineapple and he might have to move back into his parent's house.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy: Featuring the voices of Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway.  SB and Patrick try to get their heroes out of retirement.

Pickles: SB is devastated when he forgets to put pickles on Bubble Bass' krabby patty.

Hall Monitor: SB's title for the day goes to his head.

Jellyfish Jam: SB finds out that wild jellyfish throw wild parties.

Sandy's Rocket: Sandy plans a trip to the moon in her rocket.  SB and Patrick get her there, as well as the rest of Bikini Bottom.

Squeaky Boots: Mr. Krab's convinces SB to give up his paycheck for Pearl's ill-received birthday gift.

Disc 2:

Nature Pants: SB wants to live among the jellyfish (don't we all).

Opposite Day: Squidward introduces a fake holiday to keep SB and Patrick away from him while he tries to sell his house.  Of course, it backfires.

Culture Shock: Squidward plans a talent show and hires a popular guy to clean up.

F.U.N.: Plankton and SB become friends?  I love the F.U.N. song (especially Plankton's version of the lyrics)!

MuscleBob BuffPant: SB buys blow-up muscle arms to impress Sandy and finds they are not too useful in weight-lifting competition.

Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost: Squidward doesn't mind that SB and Patrick think he's a ghost, until they decide he needs to go to the other side.

The Chaperone: SB takes Pearl to her prom.

Employee of the Month: SB and Squidward compete for the honor.

Scaredy Pants: The Flying Dutchman doesn't like SB dressing as him for Halloween.

I Was a Teenage Gary: Gary is left in the care of Squidward who forgets to feed him.  The ending to this one is hilarious.

SB-129: Squidward gets locked into a freezer and, when he is thawed out, finds himself in the future with his two biggest nightmares worse than ever.

Karate Choppers: [w/ commentaries] Mr. Krabs orders SB to stop playing karate.

Sleepy Time: SB enters the dreams of select Bikini Bottom residents; much to their nightmares.

Suds: Patrick tries various techniques to cure SB of the suds so he will not have to go to the dreaded doctor.

Valentine's Day: When SB's valentine delivery to Patrick is delayed, Patrick completely freaks out.

The Paper: Squidward is so impressed with what SB can do with a gum wrapper he threw away, he trades everything he owns to get it back. Then he finds it is just not the same.

Disc 3:

Arrgh!: Mr. Krabs takes the board game Treasure Hunt a little too seriously.

Rock Bottom: SB gets off the bus at the wrong stop and finds himself in strange territory with terrible bus service.

Texas: One of my favorites.  SB and Patrick try to convince the homesick Sandy that Bikini Bottom is her really home.

Walking Small: Plankton hopes he can recruit SB to clear the beach for the construction of his Chum Bucket Mega-Bucket.

Fools in April: Annoyed by SB's constant April tomfoolery, Squidward goes too far in getting him back.

Neptune's Spatula: Another fave of mine.  Neptune is skeptical that SB pulled the mythical spatula from the ancient grease.

Hooky: When SB does not heed his boss' advice about staying away from fishing hooks, Mr. Krabs must teach him a lesson.

Mermaidman and Barnacleboy II: SB wins the Conch Signal and runs his heroes ragged with trivial tasks.

This disc includes lots of extras including (but not limited to) interviews with the actors who supply the voices, a history of the show, Violent Femmes sing Spongebob, and a Patchy the Pirate-hosted Bikini Bottom tour (curiously, Patrick's rock is not included).",1109721600,47,5501,4.902386117136659

1916076,5,B0000C2IQB,"Yes Patrick we can!  Over a year from the release date of the first Spongebob Squarepants DVD (Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies) comes what all fans wanted from the beginning:  The Complete First Season, all 40 episodes!  I like many others grabbed up the first few compilation discs like so many Krabby patties with extra pickles (I only bought 4) all the time wondering why in the world would such a popular cartoon series not immediately have season sets?  Where in the world is the Krabby Patty Value Meal if you catch my drift? The truth of the matter is the season sets on DVD were probably always planned, but then why spend a year releasing various ""themed"" collections with what will eventually appear on the complete sets?  Becau$e $pongebob make$ money!  Yes it's greedy and it only makes sense if you look at it that way.  With Season One on the shelf and Season two around the corner there really is no reason to continue buying or recommend buying the compilations.  There are 10 currently available with an 11th due out soon.  Which all together covers over 100 episodes of the roughly 120 that make up seasons 1 thru 3.  If you're a casual fan, by all means keep up with the occasional collection dvd release, but if you're a completist your journey through Bikini Bottom and all of it's watery and wiggly inhabitants begins here matey!  All 40 episodes spread over three discs in a delightful green box with our beloved yellow sponge (or is he cheese?) plastered on the cover.  Since you can get episode listings from other reviews and other places I'll do something a little different in dedication to the compilation buyers.

The 10 Spongebob DVDs currently available include 30 of the 40 Season 1 episodes.  So obviously if you've bought all these I can't recommend you go spend the money for this season set to get the 10 episodes you don't have.  However if you are like me and you've only bought say the first 4, then you only have 16 of the first season episodes.  So by getting the Season 1 box set you'll be gaining 24 episodes you don't have.  Of course I realize that everyone may have different discs so here is the run down on how many each of the compilation discs have in terms of season 1 episodes:

Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies: 5

Halloween: 3

Sea Stories: 3

Tales from the Deep: 5

Lost at Sea: 5

Tide and Seek: 2

Christmas: 2

The Seascape Capers: 1

Spongebob goes prehistoric: 2

1916077,5,B0000C2IQB,I love spongebob and have not purchased this dvd yet. I have several of the vhs movies but I can't seem to find a video at all of one of my favorites. It is the one where spongebob and patrick go door to door selling candy bars. Does anyone know if that is available on vhs/dvd? I did give this item 5 stars cause I love spongebob and know it will be 5 stars when I get it. Thanks,1094083200,,380,3.8227848101265822
1916078,5,B0000C2IQB,"SPONGEBOB IS ONE OF THE BEST CARTOONS EVER CREATED!!! There I said it & I mean it. A lot of people (not Spongebob fans of course) think this cartoon is totally senseless. But the ones I've actually been able to sit down & force to watch a few episodes have happily converted.  Okay the premise is ridiculous, but that's the fun of it & the characters are great. Don't mind that a lot of the things that happen don't make sense, it's a CARTOON. Even the characters make fun of themselves, like how can they hear without ears & how can they make fire if they're under water? It's also kind of educational. WHAT!! Did I say ""EDUCATIONAL""? YES!! Just watch the episodes & see what our favorite sponge & friends learn about lying, stealing, cheating, greed & being mean to friends & you'll see what I mean. Of course the lessons aren't thrown in your face, but they're in there & my son understands. It makes me a proud Spongebob fan (& father) when my (now six-year old) son looks at me & says, ""Mr. Krabs only loves money & that's bad."" Or ""Spongebob wouldn't have gone through all that if he didn't lie.""  I know there are still skeptics out there (I was one) but a cartoon like this doesn't just become what it is without there being ""something"" special about it. One of my favorite things on DVD's are the ""behind the scenes"" & ""making of"" features & this DVD has it's own list of features that gives people like me more insight & understanding of what goes into making Spongebob special. This is a great buy! So stop reading & buy it! BUY IT NOW! GO AHEAD!!",1092441600,44,1558,4.350515463917525
1916079,5,B0000C2IQB,"you can never have enough sponge bob and the first season is 40 episodes of great fun. from ""hooky"" to ""ripped pants"" this set will provide lots of laughs for you and your entire family.",1083542400,,186,4.3428571428571425
1916080,5,B0000C2IQB,"This is one of the best dvds I've ever had.  The menu looks really cool and the episodes have been redone so they look bright and shiny like season two and three.  As you might already know The first episode Help Wanted is missing so you can't really call it complete,  But then again the missing episode really isn't that funny like other ones so I've got no regrets. The bonus footage is about ninty minutes so there's lots to have a look at.  And with dozens of great episodes so it's quite a good buy for just forty bucks.  So over all I would give it a five! So if you've got forty bucks, and wanna have a good laugh, then buy  Spongebob Squarepants the Complete first Season on dvd.",1082419200,2,688,4.213740458015267
1916081,5,B0000C2IQB,This is a great collection of SpongeBob episodes. Actually I am watching it right no! There are so many episodes on here that you will never run out of viewing pleasure. My advice is for you to buy this DVD.,1079308800,,207,4.2
1916082,5,B0000C2IQB,"This collection is awesome, i have been a fan of spongebob ever-since we got dtv and i got the first season for Christmas and i too wondered where help wanted was, but it still rocks.  Go see the movie in november.",1078531200,2,214,4.219512195121951
1916083,5,B0000C2IQB,"I used to wonder why my daughter never missed an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants.  What was funny about a sponge with tiny arms and legs?  Squidward, Cashier at the Krusty Krab?  It looked ridiculous.  One day, I sat down and watched it with her.  I realized it was funny and I was hooked.  I recommend a few episodes of Spongebob Squarepants every day.  All 16 episodes of this collection can be viewed over and over, because you'll see something new everytime you watch it.",1078531200,9,476,4.595238095238095
1916084,3,B0000C2IQB,"I purchased this DVD collection because of my love of Spongebob. This collection is only the first season so there are episodes on the individual releases that are not on this one. However, this collection is not 'complete'. The pilot episode 'Help Wanted' was left out. The pilot episode shows where spongebob gets ready to apply for his job at the Krusty Krab. Then has to prove himself, as the great fry cook he is, by preparing krabby patties for a mass of customers. I'm not sure how you could call it complete w/out it. The missing episode was the only disappointing factor of this set. I am a huge fan of Spongebob as are my kids!!",1078012800,20,638,4.461538461538462
1916085,5,B0000C2IQB,"the reason help wanted isn't on the DVD set is because there was a problem with securing rights, probably the song at the end of the episode",1075248000,6,140,4.222222222222222
1916086,4,B0000C2IQB,"So I've bought all the DVD's seperate plus the complete season and I'm a bit disappointed. There are just as many episodes on the single purchased dvd's that are not on the complete set, that the complete set has which are unique to it. Another words, buying the complete season one was not a superset of anything I already had.
There's been atleast one episode on each one of my single DVD which didn't exist on the complete set. I guess nickeleon makes you buy everything they release to be able to get a complete set.
If I was rating the boxset compared to what has been released, I would only give it 3/5, but since I have to give it a rating on the actual episodes on the boxset, and I love spongebob, I have to give it 5/5.
So, I'll compromise. 4/5",1073692800,3,754,4.243055555555555
1916087,5,B0000C2IQB,"You may have bought all the other Spongebob Squarepants DVDs like me, but buying the Season One Boxset will be worth it! It includes episodes not found on the other DVDs and is packed with tons of special features including the Orgin of Spongebob! Enjoy!",1072396800,5,254,4.666666666666667
1916088,1,B0000C2IQB,"Where is Help Wanted?  How can this be the ""complete"" first season without this episode?  The Spongebob fan in our house is really disappointed.",1072224000,31,144,4.958333333333333
1916089,5,B0000C2IQB,"I first started watching this show at work. It's so funny,that I fell in love with it. And when I came upon this dvd set, I just had to buy it! Now I can watch the ones I love over and over again! I can't wait for the second season to come on dvd!",1071446400,4,247,3.5925925925925926
1916090,5,B0000C2IQB,i got this for christmas and i loved it. spongebob is the best. i have been watching spongebob since it came out on tv.,1071014400,,119,4.0
1916091,4,B0000C2IQB,"I first saw this show with my little cousin and I think I found it funnier than she did! This show is great for kids and adults alike. SpongeBob is just an innocent little sponge that wants to be friends with everyone and doesn't have a mean bone in his body...after all he is a sponge. I am suprised how entertaining this cartoon is. It sort of harkens back to the old Loony Toons cartoons. The DVD is packed with 40 episodes of SpongeBob mahem. There is a ""Play All"" option although I don't believe any full grown adult could sit through 40 staight episodes of SpongeBob. There are a few little behind the scenes features that are pretty interesting. The Violent Femmes promo is a suprising yet appreciated extra. I took a star off for the lack of commentaries. The segments are only 15-20 minutes long, they could have had more commentaries than two. Overall, it is a nice little DVD set that is a must for the SpongeBob fans.",1070928000,3,929,4.43859649122807
1916092,5,B0000C2IQB,"What can I say?
All 40 episodes plus the bonus features. If you are in any way a Spongebob fan, get it!!!
I've seen most of the episodes on tv, but the special features are my favourite. It's great to put a face to the voices. I've seen Tom Kenny (Spongebob) on stage twice at Montreal's Just for laughs, years ago. It was very hard to make the connection between Tom Kenny and Spongebob. He even shows you how he does that annoying laugh.
I don't know if this dvd is more for me or my daughter, but she'll probably win in the end.",1068076800,,531,4.115384615384615
1916093,3,B0000C2IQB,"Okay, i love this show.  But, it does get annoying, so i deducted one star.  I also noticed that the first season does not include the best episode of anything ever, ""Sailor Mouth"".  So i deducted one point..It doesn't really matter what i think  cause if you love Spongebob, you're gonna buy this anyway.",1067299200,3,305,4.592592592592593
1916094,4,B0000C2IQB,"If you didn't know how popular Spongebob is than this is definite proof. The first ever Nick Toon to receive a complete Season 1 DVD release. This is almost unheard of in the world of 12 minute shorts made for children the age 5 and over. Unlike all the other Nick Toons Spongebob has hit a chord that hasn't been struck since the likes of Ren and Stimpy have graced our television sets. Its a shame we all bought the past releases thinking ""well this is as good as it gets."" I never saw this coming I am both shocked and happily surprised. Sure I feel ripped off, but I'm glad I can get all the episodes now. Those ten per episode discs were boggling my mind with no end as to how would I own them all?
Just release all three seasons within a reasonable time span and one day I will completely forgive them for misleading us with the single disc releases. Can't wait for the movie.

1916095,1,B0000C2IQB,"boy nickolodean will do anything to get a buck. what a good idea to make ppl waste money on the 14 dollar dvds that only have 9 episodes on them for the past 2 years. are people just supposed to throw those dvds away? even if parent bought them for their children, they are still going to want the complete first set because it says ""sponge bob"" on it.. what a good idea, wish it was mine.",1065312000,12,389,4.064935064935065
1916096,4,B0000C2IQB,"This release is much awaited by many spongebob fans across the world, especially after being teased with several spongebob releases with 10 random episodes each, finally u will be able to add the 1st complete season to your collection.  Just to correct one of the former reviews, the first season is not every spongebob episode known to date. The first season ran from July of 1999 until May 2000 and included 20 episodes, keep in mind every episode has 2 stories, so u can look at it as really getting 40 episodes.  ANyhoo this is an absolute must for any spongebob fan, don't waste your money on the silly 10 episode releases, just get the seasons as they are released.",1064707200,48,671,4.583333333333333
