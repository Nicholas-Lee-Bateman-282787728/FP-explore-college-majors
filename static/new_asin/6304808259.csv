928806,1,6304808259,"The only reason I put one star is that Amazon doesn't have fewer. This movie is so bad that it's laughable. It has very little resemblance to the life of St. Francis, Catholicism, or Italian history. It opens with followers of history's most popular saint meeting in the wilderness to discuss his life. He is supposed to be dead, but considering that the real St. Francis lived to be an old man, all these original followers of his ought to have been old too. Instead, they are barely out of their teens -- including St. Clare, who is with them for some reason. Of course she and the Poor Clares were cloistered Sisters, but here she is the only female follower of St. Francis and hangs around with the guys, even dressing like them.

So much for history -- how about story? Let's just say that if the real St. Francis was this nutty, they'd have locked him up. Mickey Roarke as St. Francis??? This is a mess of a movie, but it is at least good for a laugh. Take, for instance, the popular medieval Italian game of ""throw lunch at a leper."" Ha ha! Throughout the film Francis is called Francesco and Clare is called Chiara. While this might be simply to give them their Italian nicknames, it may also be because the creators were too ashamed to use their real names.

The best part is that the cover of my edition, in addition to photos of Roarke and Carter, has a photo of a priest in the lower right corner -- a 20th century priest, with glasses!",1135900800,9,1448,4.359259259259259
928807,5,6304808259,"For some inexplicable reason, I completely missed this 1989 film about St. Francis directed by Liliana Cavani. I didn't even know it existed until this week when I happily stumbled upon it and rented it, only to view it last night for the very first time. Neither did I ever notice that Francesco, starring Mickey Rourke and Helena Bonham Carter, is one of the fifteen films listed on the 1995 Vatican film list in the category of ""Religion."" And it was placed high on that list for a good reason. It is simply the best cinematic retelling of the story of St. Francis I have ever seen. This may be due to the wonderful cinematography, which oscillates between the sunlight and torchlight shadows of the middle ages, and it may be due to it's period authenticity and lack of over-acting which is the bane of so many films about the poverello.

Unlike Franco Zeffirelli's movie, ""Brother Sun-Sister Moon"", which makes St. Francis appear something like a 60's founder of a hippie commune, Cavani makes St. Francis more human, a young virile man grasped by, and growing into, the awareness of God ---and his poor--- without glossing over that grace which leads him from curiosity about God and about human suffering to a radical love for simplicity rooted in creation and the cross. That radical love issues in a desire to alleviate that suffering whenever possible through works of mercy, all depicted movingly in this film. When Francesco holds a bowl, there is food in it for the poor.

It was this love for creation which possessed Francesco, a creation which pointed Francesco straightway to the Creator who was otherwise blissfully untutored in the sometimes bewildering details of theology. His school was the cross of Jesus which, upon conversion, he hugs so profoundly in this film. And he knew the Beatitudes, unlike, alas, so many America First Catholics in this country today who seem to prefer war to the call to be peacemakers and to the admonitions of the popes. For such, the peacemaking of St. Francis must seem impractical, madness; something to explain away rather than imitate.

Francis loved voluntary poverty and detachment from the bondage of the love for material things. Possessing nothing, he would possess all and give all.

While there are the usual and true encounters with the monstrosities of some hypocritical church leaders of the time in this movie, even one burning at the stake which utterly repels the future saint, Cavani also shows the true willingness of Francesco's bishop to give him a chance to show that he was not simply another heresy-prone enthusiast which plagued the Church at the time. This film is far from a subtle polemic with subtexts againt the Church. Francis is indeed a reformer, but, true to history, his was the reforming of a son, of a lover of the Church, not that of a bitter revolutionary. Like a true reformer he was always reforming first himself, striving against ""the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life,"" (1 Jn 2:15-17).

In my opinion the younger Mickey Rourke, something of a bad boy of American films, does a splendid job in this film. His portrayal is at once utterly convincing and charming. Helena Bonham Carter as Clare has the lesser role, but her devotion to the saint is clear. Her cherubic face and eyes lend an innocence to the event which they, together, were and are.

I was reminded once again that the friars life with its eschatological dimension is a sign not only of the Kingdom of Heaven, but a call for us laypersons here and now. A call to simplicity, to love of Christ's poor, to peacemaking and the stewardship of creation. And it is ever a reminder that theology must be made flesh, not merely talked or written about. Do see the film. ----Stephen Hand, TCRNews.com",1117152000,34,3782,4.766412213740458
928808,3,6304808259,"NOTE (October 6,2011) I have since watched other st francis movies and especially Clare and Francis.  I am forced to revise my review with the following points: Brother Sun Sister Moon is now horrible for me and this is just average.  I have since reduced the rating from 5 to 3 (end of note)

Being a longtime devotee of Saint Francis, I have read at least 10 biographies and seen the three most famous films about him.  Francis of Assisi (1961) is a good introductory film, while Brother Sun Sister Moon (1973) was an adequate retelling of the story.  In my mind, however, Francesco is the most historically accurate of the three.  There is little of Hollywood or Flower Power in here.  Francesco's struggles and rough faith journey is well presented.  The names used for the main characters is in the old Italian, with Chiara used instead of Claire, Leoni instead of Leo, among others.
Good points: Vangelis' masterful score lends a tangible atmosphere of spiritual struggle.  Helena Bonham Carter's Portayal of St. Claire, or Chiara, was insipiring and memorable.  I named my daughter Chiara as a result.  The supporting characters, especially Pietro Catani and Leoni, were magnificent.
Bad points: Unfortunately, this movie couldn't be perfect.  The one fly in the ointment for me was Mickey Rourke.  At times, especially in scenes involving lepers, he truly captures the character of the saint.  Most of the time, however, he just seems to me to be rattling off memorized lines.
Another point worth noting is that the miraculous events of Francis' life were minimized.  No talking crucifixes or any of that here.  Only the stigmata.  But what an impact that scene makes!
I've seen two versions of this movie.  One was from a Japanese laserdisc and another was the VHS version.  It appears that scenes were rearranged for the VHS version, and I suppose that this accounts for the ""disjointedness"" that many other reviews mention.  The Japanese laserdisc version I saw had a much more coherent scene arrangement.
Still, I give this 5 stars.",1115424000,11,2044,4.921052631578948
928809,5,6304808259,"Francesco is one of my three favorite Mickey Rourke films, along with Year of the Dragon and Angel Heart.  People tend to malign it for one of the following reasons: 1) they hate Mickey Rourke  2) they don't like the Christian themes  3) they like the Christian themes but are upset by the nudity  4) they don't like the way the film ends.

Regarding the Rourke haters, I feel they simply have no class.  Mickey Rourke's career followed much the same path as Errol Flynn's, which is reason to malign him personally but not his work.  Rourke in his heyday had a charisma and screen personality that rivaled Valentino, Flynn, or Bogart.  Regarding the anti-Christians, you don't have to be a believer to enjoy the story of a remarkable man.  As for the prudists, the nudity is brief and natural, nothing tasteless.  Finally, as for the ending, in real life people who later were ""sainted"" (like Francesco d'Asisi) or ""deified"" (like Jesus) did not get carried away by angels.  They experienced failures and then they died, often miserably and alone, just like everyone else.  This film presented that cold reality much like it probably happened; that is precisely what makes it so poignant and relevant.

Francesco is an Italian film directed by Liliana Cavani.  Rourke is American and co-star Helena Bonhan-Carter is English, but the rest of the cast is Italian save for the clerics who are primarily German actors.  Italians have a long history of creating dubbed films (La Strada, A Fistfull of Dollars, etc) and so a dubbed version for Italian consumption was certainly released on the continent (no dubbing is evident on the English version here).  The soundtrack is by Vangelis.  The newer released version of the DVD currently in circulation has different artwork, is presented only in fullscreen, and has no captions or special features to speak of.  But it's the only version available as of this writing so well worth the asking price.",1071100800,10,1943,4.871951219512195

Although this becomes a little disjointed toward the conclusion, I found this careful film intimate and fascinating.

928812,5,6304808259,"Casting Mickey Rourke as St. Francis of Assisi makes as much sense as giving Doris Day the role of Medea! I mean, the guy looks old, flabby and tatooed; not at all your average ""Poverello""!
But maybe that's  just the point director Liliana Cavani is trying to make: that someone as  crass as Rourke can become an extraordinary saint but by the Grace of God.  And if so, the movie works to perfection, avoiding the  don't-worry-be-happy, life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries attitude of 'Brother Sun,  Sister Moon'. This St. Francis suffers, has doubts and pays a heavy price  for the life he seeks. It is perhaps too gloomy at times but certainly more  accurate, and -I think- complements the Zeffirelli classic by showing the  other side of this amazing man's persona.
I bought this film because a  cousin of mine who works at the Vatican recommended it to me. She told me  the Pope was very distraught after seeing  it, and that he even cried at  the end. You may believe this or not (I do), but the movie is surely far  more intense and thought-provoking that whatever the cretinous Mr. Maltin  may say about it.",959904000,24,1105,4.6875

928865,5,6304808259,"One of the best movies I've ever seen about St Francis Life, unlike Brother Sun Sister Moon, or Francisco And Clare, this movie concentrates on the human side of Saint Francis, it submerges on those little details hard to watch, the great struggle that he has to dedicate entirely his life to God, and some of his so-called extremist ways of doing it, even the problems with his own order. Another side that explores really differently is his relationship  and he endures persecution at the hands of the family of Chiara Offreduccio Clare (Elena Bonham-Carter); the love that they had in common for the word of Jesus Christ. He seeks the Pope's blessing and many join the order he has established and then rebel at his expectations. In near despair - and ill - he writes a Rule to take to the Pope.

928873,4,6304808259,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot)com says: Francesco is a beautiful film. St. Francis of Assisi had a helluva life, and here's one version of how that iconic statue in your garden of a kind old man with birds upon spread arms came to be. But know, now, many times the acting has that kinda spaghetti-western-style of overt misplaced semi-professional-actors-upon-a-stage like bravado. Thankfully, the tilt-a-whirl of acting calibers does not take away from the story of St. Francis, or from Cavani's often gorgeous direction.

In the film, we are privy to Francesco's storied process of growing in spirit and higher-calling devotion. He basically goes from a gregarious, spoiled rich kid party boy to a leader of an entire ultra-strict religious order, living in poverty and ultimately becoming a Saint - a literal Saint, not a euphemism.

Story goes ...Francesco (Mickey Rouke pre-facial surgeries) lives a pretty privileged life; complete with boys-of-Italy-will-be-boys brothel visits and shooing away beggars like fly-fodder; It's a sharp verbal swat for those who dare enter his orbit. Hes livin the high life in his little Assisi.

In this story gleaned from parts of known biographical bits taken from Herman Hesse's 'Francis of Assisi,' Francesco changes the day he meets a stunning childhood friend, turned gorgeous lady, Chiara (played by Helens Bonham Carter who will become St. Clare). Immediately, Francesco attempts to woo her in his usual semi-pompous guy ways. She'll have none of it. Then, after Frank witnesses her odd kindness to a street urchin, he not only let a beggar in his store, but gave him many coins  while the lady was present.

What was perhaps, at first, a flirty gotta-get-the-girl ploy, has a huge impact when he realizes kindness feels good. And after a terrible time as a prisoner of war, where he watches a devote Jesus follower tortured to death for his beliefs. Francesco has an epiphany of the soul. He wants to fellow Jesus to the letter. When he is saved from captivity by his father's ransom, he chooses to leave all his comforts and goes to live among the poor. Some of his friends eventually follow him and also step away from their family wealth.

A charismatic man, now living with those he once winced at, Francesco begins to share his vision of life with less and kindness to all. When this is not enough, he begins to beg God to speak to him. As it is shot, and probably looked to those around him, you have to ask, Is he mad? Is he simply slowly losing his mind?

And is this version of his life, the only animal-centric thingy really attached to his works is a lamb he, and his followers, spared from spit even though they were so hungry due to poverty oaths. Though, according to his actual friend and first biographer, it was his communing and speaking with many animals; most famously forest birds who, as legend goes, flocked around and stayed until his speeches were done. And, of course his then novel idea of treating animals as equals.

The film instead hones in on his becoming a man of poverty who goes from thinking he is better than most, to wanting to teach all are equal (poor, rich, learned, lepers, women, animals, etc.) ala one man: Jesus. Ultimately, both were very Universal Unitarian in the principles; all are beloved and to be respected  no denominational castes or judgments. What ever Francesco did, and what ever has become lore, he lived his life as he wished and was a very kind man. This film shares parts of his story beautifully.",1445558400,2,3514,4.833610648918469

It's not that a very young Mickey portraying Saint Francis Of Assisi is bad, or that Helena Bonham Carter portrays Saint Clare badly; it's that the director previously made a TV movie of this in Italy and then remade it into a disjointed mess. It's fairly difficult to get emotionally invested when the story jumps about to seemingly random moments in the life of Saint Francis. Even the WikiP entry for this film says, ""A series of episodes from Francis' life follows, rather than a coherent narrative."" The most bizarre moment of all would have to be Mickey inexplicably humping a mound of snow. I'm not making this up. Okay sure, the guy loved nature and he was blissful... but somehow this sudden moment of ecstasy feels like a curve ball, rather than a deepening of character. I especially enjoyed the discomfort Mickey elicits for the end where he's put upon to make rules for his order. The production design rightfully earned some awards, but the director was only nominated for the Golden Palm; she didn't win (for a reason).

There are many words that can be used to describe Rourke, but spiritual is not one of them, and it shows in this film - mumbling one's lines does not equate to piety. The movie plods along at almost two hours, and, in addition to being overlong, there is no sense of how much time has lapsed from one scene to the next, which destroys the film's cohesion and can, at times, be quite confusing.

Starring Mickey Rourke and Helena Bonham Carter as Francis and Clare respectively, the actors capture the heart of these sacred personalities without overstating their case.  For Rourke's part one can't help but appreciate the repertoire of someone who can make a portrayal of Francis look so effortless after doing such a tragic protagonist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Heart/dp/B00005N915/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Heart</a>.  The production isn't flashy, and the lighting tends to accentuate the earth tones that match the spirit and mood of the project.

Genuinely highlighting the key portions of their lives, the movie skips back and forth to Francis's eulogy where Clare and other key followers grieve and honor his passing and the resonance he brought to their lives.  While this facet of the movie is effective at the end and in some other key places, it is a bit jarring and takes away the absorbing moments shown during his life.
