2004380,5,B0001I55LU,"Series 2 1/2 (Not sure why they called it this; it is just as long as the other two) is so very, very good.  We get to see more of the England house and all of the Oz's gold records.  WOW!  The series is typical of the family and is great fun.  The only issue I have with it is the final episode, and I won't discuss it here.  I am not sure if this was supposed to be a joke or a spoof of other reality TV series.  I only hope that there are more shows in the future.  NOT FOR KIDS!",1084406400,8,482,3.621359223300971

I love Ozzy, Black Sabbath and His entire family!! What more can I say?",1408147200,,279,4.365384615384615

2004400,5,B0001I55LU,"This show is tons of fun to watch. With each member of the Osbourne family still successful and working in the entertainment world, I am shocked that the other seasons of this show haven't been released on DVD! Amazon has exclusively released many MTV/Viacom shows on DVD recently, and I would love it if they could release the remaining seasons do The Osbournes.",1379808000,,363,4.777777777777778
2004410,5,B0001I55LU,"Last season of the osbournes! That sucks! It is still funny to hear ozzy talk, but he still is the prince of darkness! Everyone should own the last dvd in this sitcom!",1375228800,,167,4.25
2004411,3,B0001I55LU,"This was not a pretty site for me to see and it has been ten years since filming this season, but it is sad to me. You can hardly follow Ozzy's speach, there are people everywhere in the home that I love (I loved season 1 as I could see all the decorating that I drool over in their home), and everything seems off kilter and spun out of control. As Jack had stated in the voice over on Season 1 DVD, the house seemed more innocent then. And it is so CROWDED during this season. Drove me nuts and I am just viewing it!",1372982400,,518,3.942857142857143
2004412,5,B0001I55LU,"Hilarious!  I loved watching this show all over again!  Ozzy is a funny guy, and the whole family is crazy!",1364688000,,107,4.3

2004414,5,B0001I55LU,The Osbornes are at it again. It is a screen to watch and try to desipher Ozzy. They really have good mouths on them.,1358899200,,117,3.9166666666666665
2004415,5,B0001I55LU,"I own Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4. What am I missing by not having this particular set? Are there episodes that never aired? I love this show so much and really want to make sure I have every episode available. I've also noticed that this is a ""Print on demand"" set from Amazon, meaning that they are not massed produced, just burned on demand. How is the quality of this set?

Peace,
Pattie

2004416,5,B0001I55LU,"I loved this show.  Yeah it was crude, had more profanity than anything Ive ever seen,  the kids were downright obnoxious but you cant blame people for how they acted when they were kids, people change.
  I think the shows hilarious.  After ive had a bad day or someones been bustin my chops its great to go home and pop in one of the dvds and have a laugh.  I also have alot of respect for sharon being brave enough to let people see what went on when she went through her battle with colon cancer.  Im sure alot of cancer patients were comforted by that.
  When i first heard about this show yeah i thought ozzy has sold out but then i got into it.  The only thing that I just didn't get on the show was how Jack fixated on Black Sabbath.  It was like he was perfectly happy to live in his dads shadow as ozzy osbournes son, milking his dads fame to do whatever he wanted.  Im a firm believer in the ""get a life of your own"" way of life, make your own acomplishments. The whole im in no hurry to move out of the house, im gonna keep staying here and live rent free (which in a house that size with a big beautiful pool, an arcade, a gymn and a a big room with just about anything a guy could want, that wouldnt be much of a sacrifice.)  He may have made a life of his own by now though, i really don't see him in much of anything anymore.  I think he works somewhere in the record business.
celebrity kids do have one major advantage though, they screw up big and pick themselves back up and get their lives straight they still land killer jobs but in the ""not so hollywood"" world, you can screw up when your young and people, schools and jobs are gonna be busting your chops for the rest of your career. coming from a teenage screw up grown up straitened up and fighting tooth and nail trying to get into medical school, i can say it doesnt work that way for everybody.",1312848000,,1872,4.093150684931507
2004417,4,B0001I55LU,"Back before MTV got all Jersey Shore on us there was The Osbournes. A show that looked into the life of Ozzy Osbourne, his wife Sharon, son Jack, and daughter Kelly. I of course bought every season because I am a lifelong fan of Ozzy and Sharon. After watching this show you kind of get a feel of what Ozzy's life is kind of like. I know that this show was really like thousands of hours or so and they just edited the crap out of it but it's actually pretty addicting when you start watching it. It's full of humor, alot of Kelly and Jack drama, and well Ozzy. The way they end season 2 1/2 is so great. You have to see it! It's not like every other episode and it will have you so fooled:)",1275436800,,691,4.0144927536231885
2004418,1,B0001I55LU,"Ozzy, Sharon and the rest are nothing more than clowns now, sellout clowns.  This show sucks and defiled ozzys legacy, now he has proven he is nothing more than a money hungry, greedy sellout.",1273449600,,192,4.647058823529412
2004419,5,B0001I55LU,"I love The Osbournes! I love reality shows like this that aren't necessarily competitions (my favorites are always early eliminated), but are just a bunch of people interacting. And these guys are my favorite family ever. It's hilarious and entertaining whenever, and it's great to watch their various personalities clash, and even when they're getting along it's almost tumultuous. This 1/2 season is no different, and though it's only 1/2 a season, it really is worth having, if only for the last episode. I just love this show.",1271116800,3,530,5.034090909090909
2004430,5,B0001I55LU,I am wondering the same thing this person is asking! Would LOVE to see the Osbournes DVD's come out ALL THE SEASONS! They were hilarious and loved watching them. What's the deal on this? If they ever do come out I know I will be buying them. Anyone know what the hold up is?,1246147200,5,274,4.092592592592593
2004431,4,B0001I55LU,"I find people that say this show only makes fun of Ozzy are completely missing the point. Obviously Ozzy has a mischievous sense of humor so who knows when hes exaggerating his offness and laughing behind the camera. Of course everyone else on the show comes off as completly arrogant and completly spoiled as hell, which makes the Ozzman look, (to me at least, and should to anyone with a shred of common sense) the voice of reason and the only down to earth person there which translates to the Ozz bearing the real heart of the show. I really couldn't give a damn about anyone else on the show. Ozzy made me relate somehow to all the otherwise trashy goings-on around this family and somehow brought a level of intelligence to the bratiness. Sure the guy may have problems but Ozzy is still more there than he gets credit for. I see his ramblings as no more than social awkwardness which I personally suffer from as well. So if you are an Ozzy fan and the reviews that say Ozzy is put to shame and exploited in this show are keeping you away from it, ignore them and take it from me: if you're watching through honest and open eyes this show shows a streak of what all us Ozzy fans saw in him already, integrity. This show is great for the price you can probably pick it up for and lets you laugh not just at Ozzy but if you're fairly intelligent, with him too.",1234569600,4,1364,4.311284046692607
2004432,5,B0001I55LU,"Plain & simple.  When you need a laugh...put these guys on.  Season 1 & 2 1/2 where the best.  Season 2 dragged for some reason.  Probably cause the mood changed with Sharon's chemo episodes.  ""The Ozz Man & the Sea""  was the best show of that season.",1232236800,,251,4.23404255319149
2004433,5,B0001I55LU,This is exactly what I expected.  A fun season and the price was great!,1231632000,,71,4.071428571428571

2004436,5,B0001I55LU,"am i the only one whos wondering when/if the rest of the osbournes season dvds will be coming out???  am i the only one who cares?  try doing a google search on osbournes third season dvd or anything like that, theres absolutely no reference, news, or discussion about it.  whats going on?",1133049600,4,289,4.519230769230769
2004437,1,B0001I55LU,"I can't believe that Ozzy fans give this series a great review! Sharon Osbourne has used Ozzy's fame to create this idiotic show about how dysfunctional their family is and she seems to relish in the fact that her husband is falling apart.

Jack and Kelly are no-talent idiots, riding along with their mum as they continue to make one of the best front men in rock and roll look looking like a stooge. Hey, I'll be the first one to face facts and lay the blame at Ozzy's feet for screwing up his life with alcohol and drugs, but why in God's name would his wife want to capitalize on the fact that he is now in rough shape because of his early days!?!?!

Recent events with Ozzfest lead me to believe that Sharon Osbourne is a money grubbing shrew and she is going to milk Ozzy for all he is worth until he is dead, at which point I am sure she will have his remains embalmed and take his corpse on tour and charge us all $200 to look at the ""Dead Ozzy""!

Out of respect for Ozz, don't buy this garbage and let Sharon know where she can stick ""Her Reality""!",1125964800,7,1057,4.146341463414634
