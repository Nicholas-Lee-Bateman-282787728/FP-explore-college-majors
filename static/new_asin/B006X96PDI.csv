5035453,5,B006X96PDI,"Excellente!  These guys do Classic Motown justice.  The original Temptations would be proud and probably shocked that white guys have so much soul!  This whole era of music that transcends racial lines is lost because our youth are all trying to be the next Tupac, Snoop Dog or JayZ--enough!  ((shaking my head))",1334880000,,312,4.9423076923076925

5035455,5,B006X96PDI,"This DVD is an excellent and crowd pleasing Las Vegas concert, with well-polished performances.  I found the quartet entertaining, with their smooth renditions of Motown classics and funny with a few personal snippets from their childhood singing days in Australia.

3. Baby I Need Your Loving
4. Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)
5. The Way You Do The Things You Do
6. What's Going On
7. I Heard It Through The Grapevine
8. Stop! In The Name Of Love
9. People Get Ready
10. Earth Angel
11. Ain't Too Proud To Beg
12. I'll Be There
13. You Can't Hurry Love
14. Ain't No Mountain High Enough
15. Get Ready (featuring Smokey Robinson)
16. Ooo Baby Baby
17. My Girl
18. ABC
19. I Can't Get Next To You
20. Uptight (Everything's Alright)
21. Twenty-Five Miles
22. Reach Out I'll Be There

Bonus 1: (33:01)

Human Nature's Toby Allen, Phil Burton, Andrew Tierney and Michael Tierney gather around the round table and reminisce about Motown artistry during the old Detroit days  with legends Smokey Robinson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Edward Holland, Jr.  I enjoyed listening to the conversation, with short discussions of their song making process, and brief mentions of Motown musical luminaries.  In this meeting, they jam the following songs.

My Girl
Baby I Need Your Loving
Where Did Our Love Go
Who's Loving You
Reach Out I'll Be There

Bonus 2: (3:01)

The group croons ""You Send Me,"" a cappella.
