2963854,5,B000W9C5FM,This is one of my all time favorite karate flicks.  This copy was great.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.,1386288000,,111,4.238095238095238
2963855,2,B000W9C5FM,I purchased this movie and again had the same issue with it. Audio continued to change throughout the movie. Going from English dubbing to it's original recorded track. This made the movie very irritating to watch.,1359072000,,214,4.972222222222222
2963856,5,B000W9C5FM,"This movie has all the elements of a Shaw Bros. movie you could want. The good guys are lovable underdogs who each have a different kung fu specialty.  The bad guy is a pompous egomaniac, who despite being a blow hard, is an absolutely amazing and deadly martial artist.  There are funny moments, touching moments, themes of loyalty and revenge and classic training sequences.  The fight scenes are great and the climactic showdown is electric. If you like the old school, Saturday afternoon ""kung fu theater"" movies, I think you'll find The Destroyers as satisfying as I did.",1354924800,3,576,4.857142857142857
2963857,5,B000W9C5FM,"It's a must see for the venoms fan. the film was cut in this dvd version, It was a scene when the four friends was told they can bathe before they eat and put on new cloths and as they were going to the bath pool women were in the bath waiting for them and they refused to bath with them and the woman came running out the bath pool with towels on. they need to restore the film in It's original version for rerelease.",1231200000,6,418,3.929411764705882
2963858,3,B000W9C5FM,"In my opinion this is not one of the better Venom Films.  The plot is weak, even for a Hong Kong kung fu movie, and the quality of the DVD is poor (clearly transfered from video).  However, there are good points.  Most of the Venoms appear in this film.  As usual, Lu Feng makes a great villain.  Fight scenes are well choreographed, and there is a nice variety of weapons play.  Lu Feng's glaive versus Philip Kwok's pole makes for a great fight scene.  As usual, there are fitting comic moments in the film, particularly from Chiang Sheng.  However, in the end, I would only recommend the film to fans of the Venom films.",1208736000,6,623,4.4035087719298245
2963859,5,B000W9C5FM,"The ""Venom"" guys come through in spades here.  No hokey jumping flying around or walking on water.  Just great solid Kung Fu.  Story line is interesting.  The final fight scene is fantastic, and the fighting throughout is, as the title says ""Magnificent"".",1204502400,4,255,5.0
