3953114,3,B002MXZYBS,"My family likes this cute comedy.  We were, however, so disapointed at the raunchy ending to the series!  We always assumed that Rodney's character had an act for adults - however - it didn't seem to be revealed until the last couple of shows that his act was more the stuff of sleaze clubs!  What a shame - it was such a fun little series!",1259625600,,340,4.2
3953115,5,B002MXZYBS,"I have seen Rodney live 4 times (5th time this Friday night) and this show is AMAZING!!!! Like Rodney said - ABC stands for ""anything but Carrington""! I wish comedy central would of stepped in and picked up the Rodney show and laughed in ABC's face while it skyrocketed to fame.

This show is so good, I have watched the 1st season 10 times over. Workin on that with season 2. If you haven't seen an episode of this show, you have to at least rent it. This show is a hit with my whole family over and over again.

MUST OWN!!!!",1255910400,4,526,4.147058823529412
3953116,5,B002MXZYBS,"I have always loved Rodney Carrington. He makes me laugh so hard that I have to be careful or I will stop breathing. I don't eat or drink while watching Rodney because I might laugh that hard. I have seen him live, heard him on the radio and buy his albums. He is the best. ABC really blew it by not promoting this show. THe first episode in which Rodney decides to help out by taking on some duties for the preacher is a side splitter. His great relationship with his friend Barry and his family make this a family friendly show. It is like my family anyway. Rodney's spontaneaous humor is not stifled by this show. Mac Davis as his father in law and the rest of the cast are great. I notice several country stars in supporting roles in the first set and I know there are some in this also. I had been begging for this DVD set since Rodney went off the air. It is well worth it and shows those ABC execs did not know what is good fun.",1255305600,,935,4.086956521739131
