8080820,1,B000AYELRE,"... of a very fine cast of singers! To be candid, I'd heard about this production from friends and colleagues, I knew in advance that I'd hate it, but I just felt curious. Okay, now I've wasted my money, so I get the small compensation of denouncing the stage director, the camera-persons, the sound engineers, and above all the costume designer for converting the most sublime of all operas into another buffoonery. Take away their union cards! Banish them to Bayreuth!

The camera work is terrible. Chaotic. Utterly unsystematic happenstance. The picture quality is worse than many DVDs made from old TV films of the 1970s. Pfui!

The sound quality is bumptious and harsh. Instruments erupt, instruments vanish, voices sound metallic. Double Pfui!

The gestures and postures of the actors are just plain gawky and silly, and the blocking on stage is high school pageant level. Pfui pfui pfui!

But the coup de grace is the costuming! What? Did they simply borrow the costumes from a staging of Rossini's ""Italiana in Algerie"" or Mozart's ""Abduction from the Seraglio""? How could anyone botch the affect of Orfeo more completely than this, making a clown show opera buffa of it? I'd rather have seen all the singers wrapped in white bandage gauze or bare naked but computer-frazzled.

The musical performance would have gotten at least four stars, probably five, from me if I'd had eye surgery recently and couldn't see the hideous travesty of this staging.",1318982400,3,1458,4.959016393442623
8080821,5,B000AYELRE,"It's worthwhile to buy this dvd - just because of the short aria of 'La Speranza' sung by the fantastic Philippe Jaroussky, one of the most beautiful voices of our time!",1305158400,2,169,4.483870967741935
8080822,4,B000AYELRE,"I give this production 4 stars mostly for the interview with the music director, Jean-Claude Malgoire.  In that, he speaks about many interesting things about Monteverdi, Renaissance and the ""second manner"" of music that Monteverdi invented - meaning that the contemporary manner of music - polyphony - gave way to ""parlar contando"" or recitative, which Monteverdi introduced in L'Orfeo to achieve a greater dramatic effect and to unite the text with the song more closely.  Malgoire discusses intricate details of Orfeo music, pointing, for example, that in Act III Monteverdi elevates Orfeo music to that of the gods - where he needs to tame Charon, and that this is similar to a better-known fact that in Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria Minerva has a very distinct music, very ornamented, which distinguishes her divinity.

Malgoire goes on discussing the instruments, pointing first to the fact that rarely for that time, Monteverdi specified all the instruments for L'Orfeo, including violin quintet, basso, contrabasso, and so on; also details as in the scene in Act IV where Monteverdi specified that the theorbo and the wooden organ should be on the different parts of the stage, apart from other instruments!

The conductor also reveals that the Toccata di Orfeo in the beginning is also known as an Anthem of the Duke of Mantua, and that it is also used in Monteverdi's Vespri in 1610 and in Allelujah and in Arianna, which was premiered a year later than L'Orfeo, in 1608.  The duke's arrival was announced by trumpets and trombones, and here at the opening of L'Orfeo Malgoire uses two trumpets and three trombones.

Therefore...for all these precious gems, I elevate my rating of this performance to 4 stars.  Otherwise, I'd give it a 3 - it is a good but not particularly exciting production.  The singing is from adequate to excellent; I did not find Kobie van Rensburg outstanding in Orfeo, but it was a good performance.  I must say that my main reason to see this particular L'Orfeo was to see Philippe Jaroussky, whom we in Boston await for the upcoming performance of Agostino Steffani ""Niobe, Regina di Tebe"".  The young and beautiful star sings as an angel, as he always sounds on his recordings.  But his role of La Speranza was small, alas, to enjoy his art fully.

I take stars off for a visually bizarre production - the costumes are totally eclectic and there is no unifying sense of style, which is somewhat annoying to see.  Visually, it does not come even close t o the famous Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of the same in 1970s.  But musically this is a very solid performance.
