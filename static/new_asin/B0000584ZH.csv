1403376,1,B0000584ZH,Yet another inacurate picture of what nurses do and what the level of responsibility is.  Where did wardrobe find the circa 1965 white outfit with the hat?  No nurse I know behaves or dresses like that!,969580800,2,202,4.583333333333333
1403377,4,B0000584ZH,"My wife and I enjoyed ""Nurse Betty"" even though it played like a dark disconnected dream.  It reminded us very much of the movie ""Fargo"" for all of it's wacky twists and turns. Chris Rock was hilarious because he was essentially playing himself (and got to say his favorite word about 3 dozen times). Renee Z. was a very believable 'ditz', beyond what anyone would expect of someone manifesting the effects of PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). All in all, a bizarre look at someone who is able to block out her depressing life in favor of her favorite 'soap'. Wonder how many more like her are out there?",969494400,2,609,4.638888888888889
1403378,2,B0000584ZH,"""Nurse Betty"" has got to be one of the dumbest movies that I have ever seen!  It centers around the life of a waitress named Betty,  whose life revolves around her favorite soap opera.  One night, Betty  witnesses the murder of her dirtbag husband in their home, and goes into  shock.  She leaves her midwestern hometown to track down her favorite soap  star, whom she wants to marry.  Betty's illusions are that the star is a  real doctor, that she is a real nurse, and that the couple was previously  engaged!  In the meantime, the two killers follow Betty's trail, when they  find out she witnessed the murder.  Labeled a comedy\thriller, this movie  was moronic, and, at times, a little too violent.  Don't waste your time  and money seeing this one.",969235200,7,754,4.641221374045801
1403379,4,B0000584ZH,"Arguably the best part of this nifty little movie is Morgan Freeman's  performance as a hitman searching the country for Nurse Betty. His is the  sort of role that can easily be overdone:  the soul-searching, bookish  hitman about to retire, on the cusp of some new experience that will expand  his self understanding.  Were this exaggerated, or presented too deadpan,  it would have been a disaster, but Freeman's performance is pitched  perfectly between the comic and the serious.
Overall, the movie is an  awful lot of fun.  Some of the humor is pretty dark (I was shocked at some  of the gruesomeness I was laughing at), but most of it is screwy and light.  Renee Zellweger is hard not to like, and she's as loveably dingy in this  as she's ever been.  The writing is clever, and fresh. Chris Rock  is...well, Chris Rock.  Nothing new there, except a little bit more  restraint.

1403380,5,B0000584ZH,"Things are looking up. After a summer of mostly dismal, prefabricated movies, the approach of fall heralds more ambitious fare, such as Nurse  Betty. This idiosyncratic dark comedy about a likable young woman  (Zellweger) who becomes convinced that she is a character on a soap opera  is full of surprises, impeccable acting and smart writing.
In an  extraordinary, multilayered performance that suggests Doris Day at her most  resilient, Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore, a sweet-natured waitress in a  poky Kansas diner who spends her days pouring coffee and her nights  watching taped episodes of her favorite soap, A Reason to Live. When she  inadvertently witnesses a grisly murder by two hit men, she develops  temporary amnesia. Believing she's Nurse Betty from the soap, she heads to  L.A. for a rendezvous with her true love, Reason's widowed hero, Dr. David  Ravell (Kinnear). The killers take off after her.
The ensuing journey  turns into one of self-discovery for both Betty and Charlie (Freeman), the  older, more reflective of the hit men. In her fictional guise, Betty gains  a strength she never had before while Charlie, the hard-nosed realist,  finds himself questioning everything of which he was once sure. Director  Neil LaBute (Your Friends & Neighbors) skillfully steers the film  between gentle humor, outright farce, disturbing violence and moments of  real pain, leaving the viewer in a delightful and rarely experienced  predicament: not knowing what will happen next.
The casting of Freeman  and Rock adds immeasurably to the film, with Freeman giving it tragic  grandeur and Rock contributing comic zing. Also noteworthy is Kinnear,  whose preening turn as a soap star deftly skewers the pretensions and  vanity of a minor TV personality.",968112000,8,1766,5.273381294964029

1403413,5,B0000584ZH,"I say about 10 movies should try to imitate this film and about 20 movies should be influenced by this movie in the future. This movie is so original that so many movies in the future should try to learn from it how this movie tells the story, how this movie charactorizes each actors.

I had a VHS tape for years and I bought the DVD back in 2009 and probably have watched 5 times. It was not a lot since I have watched movies like <Blade Runner><Black Rain><Someone to watch over me><A Better Tomorrow 2><The Killer><Time of the Gypsies> <Bugsy>about 20-30 times in my life. But still it's a lot of times watching this movie and each time I saw, it just made me so surprised how much original this movie is.

Don't you ever guess this movie is about some woman who worked as a nurse who is dedicated to a nurse work all her life or something. This story is far from it.

The story to be told in a most short way is,...

There is this woman who is married to this stupid man who is a second hand car shop owner who is messing around with stupid women from his shop all the time. He is doing other bad things with mob kind of guys dealing with drugs and this time he stole from them.
 He got killed in the house while the wife Renee Zellweger is watching this 'almost crazy about' soap Opera (Drama) `A Reason To Love' she witnesses her husband's death and she becomes confused that she is part of that drama and the doctor from that drama is real and she is his lover. This is kind of a mental thing by shock.
 After the killers are all gone not knowing that Renee was exist, and the cops searching the house, she decides to go to LA to find the doctor from the hospital which is not even exist-only in the drama it is.
 Now the new journey begins to her.

There are so many good things in this movie.

The way to LA, she meets this old lady working at a restaurant and when Renee talks about the doctor she is about to meet- she said she was his lover once but they were apart some time ago but she is going to LA to be together again. When the old lady hears the whole story and the name of the doctor and the name of the hospital, she knew that what she is talking about this from the drama. If this is from my country, South Korea, the lady probably would shout at her or treated her as a crazy woman. But she didn't. She worried about her that she might get hurt finding out that she was wrong and everything was her imagination. She even blessed her that she will end up with acheiving something in LA. She appeared such a short time but she was a great actor. I think her name is Tina Smith(actress).

Also as usual, Morgan Freeman is a mob who killed Renee's husband (Not actually killed but part of it) treated Renee gracefully because right after seeing her he tought her as someone different. Someone pure minded.

Criss Rock was anothr mob who was a tough bad mouthed guy who actually kills the husband and a bunch of other people who is Morgan's son. He did his job well too.

Greg Kinnear had two faces. A sweet one and a very cruel one. He acted as a doctor charactor from the drama `A Reason To Love' and when Renee approached him thinking that he is her real boyfriend, he was totally glued by her attitude. He literally was shocked. First he thought that she wanted some small roll from the TV drama. He thought that she is an actress desperately looking for any roll for the TV show. But then she was so different. She was so lovable.
 But when finally he puts her to the TV show, she was freezed and couldn't act, he was so angry at her and shouts to her to death.

The ending was a great happy one and you will love it.

The director succeeds to make more movies and now he made many. But sadly none of them became a bluck buster.

1403414,3,B0000584ZH,"Released in 2000, Nurse Betty stars Rene Zellweger as Betty, a lowly waitress married to a total jerk. She watches her favorite soap and fantasies about the hero-doctor on the show (Greg Kinnear). Meanwhile Morgan Freeman plays Charlie, the leader of a criminal duo (the other played by Chris Rock); as they chase the woman from Kansas to Los Angeles Charlie ends-up falling in love with her even though hes never met her.

This is part dramedy, part road movie, part crime drama, part romcom and part black comedy. While its rarely laugh-out loud, its pretty consistently amusing. What throws it off is that its such an eccentric mixture viewers don't know how to take it, especially when it throws in a fairly radical scalping sequence (and I don't mean scalping tickets). It helps, though, when you grasp that the movies about Betty and Charlie and their romantic idealism of people theyve never met.

This is an offbeat movie that's half-good and half-meh. The ""meh"" reaction is mostly due to its curiosities; it might play better on repeat viewings.

The movie runs almost 110 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles; Durango, Colorado; Grand Canyon, Arizona; and Rome, Lazio, Italy (closing scene).

1403443,5,B0000584ZH,"At first glance, 'Nurse Betty' looks like your usual romantic comedy or drama. It is very funny at times and has some dramatic elements, it has the ""good girl"" in a dead end job married to a moron plot device. it has hit men and soap opera stars and seeing names like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock in the cast seems conflicting and odd choices. It also has one of the most horrific murders ever put on screen! It's a strange mixture to say the least and I was totally hooked on this original black dramedy right from the beginning.

Some viewers will be turned off by the murder scene and it isn't hard to argue that point because it hits you in the gut, but it is a necessary plot point to make the rest of the story plausible. The entire cast including Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckart, Chris Rock and Crispen Glover play their parts to perfection. For those of us who love bizarre movies this one should not be missed!

Don't let the title fool you, this one is worth checking out for those who demand something different! The DVD transfer is very good with some extras including some very interesting deleted scenes, but I think this one deserves a Blu Ray upgrade.",1396310400,,1196,4.45662100456621

1403447,4,B0000584ZH,"Three is a charm, and it certainly was for Neil LaBute - his first three films (of In the Company of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors, and this one) were fresh, original, darkly funny, had personality and insightful, not clichd look inside his characters' hidden desires and motivations. What he saw often was not pretty but always honest. Of three, Nurse Betty is the best - deliciously multi-layered, full of twists and turns, making fun of the TV obsessions and turning upside- down many genres. What is the film? A sort of a cinematic onion that reveals its layers one by one. It's a black comedy and a thriller, a road movie and a modern version of the girl Dorothy's adventures in the Wizard of Oz. It is very detailed clinical description of post- traumatic stress disorder and the parallel story of two dreamers who in the same fashion created in their imagination the ideal lovers that were so far removed from reality as Kansas from Oz. And the awakening was truly shocking.

Renee Zellweger in a Golden Globe-winning performance has never been better, before or after Betty (Chicago came close). Morgan Freeman has never been as romantic and so much in love at the same time being a cold-blooded and meticulous hit-man. Greg Kinnear as a man from Betty's dreams, ""so handsome that a bit more and it would be a crime"" was perfectly cast and funny as the shallow TV star. The presence of Aaron Echhart and Crispin Glover did not hurt the film, either. But the real star is the script, so rich and unpredictable that it was pleasure following all its turns and twists. Underseen and underrated indie film that has only became better since I saw it first time soon after its release, it is a rare treat. This is a very funny and very dark film. It is dreamy, and it's one of the movies that make me happy just to know that it exists. Definitely recommended for repeat viewing. The ending is beauty itself.

There is another ""never"" I have to add -Neil LeBute has never done anything as fresh and enjoyable since ""Nurse Betty"".

I like these scenes at the Monument Valley, Arches National Park and Grand Canyon.

1403465,1,B0000584ZH,"I once took a course at a local tech school offering a course in writing drama for 30 minutes shows. Harder to do than one might think. The course was taught by a person retired from writing scripts for TV shows.

What surprised me was the simple fact that the ""Antagonist"", the bad guy, was to dominate the story up intil the last possible few moments...providing a kind a long overdue resolution, and thus at ""long last"", some blessed relief from the torture of watching the monstrous charicature of evil 'strut their stuff'. Ye gods !

First of all, this is the purist of anathema to any veteran of combat duty. Remaining focused on evil after evil, torture after torture...is anything BUT entertainment. Is IS torture. Hence the reason for the title of my review, ""gratuitous torture""...""give the sick puppies what they want - after all, this is about the almighty dollar, isn't it?""...""To Hell with redeeming social values""? ( phew.)

What makes this movie NOT work, is the expectation that an actor we all admire, and an actress we admire, and a comic we may not admire, but maybe even recoil from in disgust...are so out of character here. Oh there's plenty of disgust alright. The opening scenes of torture and murder is one that will NEVER leave your mind. One of the few  ""comic reliefs"" in the script is when, in a storm of frustration over the mindless cruelty, and bungling ineptitude of his ""son"" in the script, Chris Rock, Morgan freman rakes Chris over the coals for his whole ""shtick"", that is to say, his  vile, and profane comedy career, as doing nothing much more than ""...drag the entire country down"".
Bravo Monseur Freeman!

For a time, I took an interest in Japanese produced movies...until I discovered that there, too, the modus operandi is also to leave you with a disturbing image that you will NEVER forget.

I am aware that there are a large number of folks, if not the majority, who revel in ""being profoundly disturbed"".  Psychologists have explained this phenomena as something common among adolescents...who, privately,-not even aware of it themselves -  are ""innoculating themselves against fear"".

I'm quite serious. Any of you who have served in combat, are acutely aware of the widespread commonality of torture as THE method of gathering intelligence on the ""enemy"". These sorts of movies are definitly not amusing or entertaining in any way, shape or form.

Thus I warn anyone who thinks that ""Nurse Betty"", and great actors, and a well known ""comic""...spell ""amusing, and entertaining situation comedy"".
It is simply ""formulaic"" script writing. Anyone with a room temerature IQ could write such a script. These actors deserve better.

One wonders why on earth actors of this calibre even agree to such a vomit of  a story. Does it have something to do with a cigar smoking, arrogant producers, and contracts, and ""You WILL do this movie""?

This sort of thing does indeed drag this entire country down...mindless, amoral, inept, sadistic, demon possessed circus clowns...as ""typical Americans"".",1314748800,2,3034,4.9351669941060905

1403467,5,B0000584ZH,"Every now and then you run across a movie missed by the TV networks that should be a cult classic. Nurse Betty is a quirky original film with that ""indie"" feel to it. Renee Zellweger is a waitress in a small Kansas town. Her life consists of watching a soap opera and its star Dr. David Ravell. Her husband (Del) is a car dealer/drug dealer who cheats on her. One day while Betty is watching her soap in one room, two bad guys, Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock, lean on Del who was attempting to sell them back the drugs he stole from them. They end up killing Del, as Betty, through a parted door witnesses the scene.

Betty now becomes delusional. She blocks out the killing while believing she is the former fiancee of the fictional Dr. David Ravell and embarks on a cross country trip to find him. Meanwhile, the local cops want to question her, and the killers realizing they have a witness want to kill her.

The movie is zany as the relationship between Morgan, an intellectual killer with class and Chris Rock, a hip-hopster becomes strained. Morgan believes Betty to be cold and calculating and develops a love and respect for her as they travel,while Rock thinks she is just plain crazy. Meanwhile everyone Betty comes in contact with thinks she is nuts.

The down side to the movie is there are a few times when you start to feel sorry for Betty and that this is no longer funny, as in the Arizona bar scene. For that I suggest another long toke, don't bogat, and keep on truckin' as the movie will become funny again, and soon.",1283904000,,1544,4.410526315789474

It was interesting seeing signs put up saying ""Grand Canyon"" in the middle of the Southern California High Desert!",1254441600,2,494,4.32258064516129
1403469,4,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty has a terrific cast who pull off a script that dances through improbable sequences and provides great poignant interludes.  The movie has wry insights into the ridiculousness of Hollywood and the extremes that ordinary people will pursue to follow completely unobtainable and false goals, yet it does these things with a gentle touch rather than a heavy hammer.

Renee Zellweger is great as Betty Sizemore, a mousy housewife in Kansas whose only emotional outlet is her daily dose of the soap opera ""A Reason to Love"", which features saintly widowed heart surgeon, Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear.  Betty is loved by everyone down at the tip-top diner where she is a tip-top waitress, but emotionally abused and cheated on by her husband, Del, played by Aaron Eckhart.  Del is a car salesman with vague dreams of bigger things, sort of like Bill Macy in ""Fargo"".  Del is also like a Coen Brothers character in that he is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  In his big scene he tells Morgan Freeman's character how ""stupid"" the people are in his little Kansas town.  Freeman has Del give a specific example of what he means by ""stupid"". Del responds with an answer showing Freeman and the audience that Del meets almost anyone's definition of ""stupid"".

Freeman is Charley, a freelance hit-man, and he is accompanied by Chris Rock as his apprentice, Wesley.  Charley knows he is at the twilight of his career, and he considers himself a consummate professional, although he knows he is ""a garbage man of the human condition.""  Wesley is not as professional, prone to quicker, less thoughtful action, and grudgingly accepts Charley's lessons on professionalism.

The early scene where Del tells Charley about the ""stupid injuns"" and other bigoted things ends with Wesley scalping Del and Charley finishing the job with his pistol, so a warning about Coen-flavored violence is appropriate.

Betty is in an adjacent room watching the videotape of that day's soap opera when Del is murdered.

The violent act snaps Betty's mind, resulting in her delusion that she had a previous life where she was soap Dr. Ravell's fiance, following a plotline from the show five years ago.  She takes a Buick from Del's lot and leaves Kansas for the first time, headed for Dr. Ravell's fictional hospital.

The joy in this film comes in the way that the other characters interact with the sweet but mentally unstable Betty.  Consider the way a good-intentioned bartender in Arizona first encourages Betty when she tells her that she's trading in her no-good car dealer for a heart surgeon, then realizes that Betty earnestly believes she's headed to L.A. to hook up with a fictional character in a soap opera.

Later the magnificent Allison Janney appears as the producer of the soap opera, first amazed at Betty, who she assumes must be play-acting as an audition for the show, then ready to exploit the publicity Betty generates as a result of an incident that I'll not tell you about.

The heart of the film is the equally fictitious relationship between Morgan Freeman's Charley and the mental image he creates about Betty. Charley places Betty on a mental pedestal as a paradigm of ideal womanhood. When he learns that she has driven halfway across the country to ""reunite"" with a soap opera character he is incredulous.  ""A soap opera!?  She just wouldn't do all this because of a soap opera!"" he tells his apprentice.

But she would.

1403470,4,B0000584ZH,"This movie is funny throughout.  The acting is really good.  Chris Rock who I have always thought is funny, but not necessarily a great actor does a great job of playing a young overeager hit man.  Although, the characters of both Freeman and Rock I believe turns out to be a little too sympathetic, they brutally murder a man, but they win the audience sympathy through humor.  I think the movie has an interesting message about getting overly involved in a television show.  I remember the 1980s hearing people talk about the characters of Dallas as though they were real people.  In this case, the character goes crazy and is swept into that fantasy world.  That some people get too involved in fictional T.V. shows seems to be an underlying theme worth paying attention to.  However, sometime the movie is a little ridiculous.  It is hard to believe that the movie star of the film would not have figured out something was wrong with Betty long before she gets onto the movie set.

1403482,4,B0000584ZH,"This is one of those movies that I really didn't know if I would like it or not, based on critical reviews and those here on Amazon.

Now, I'm sorry that I waited 7 years before seeing it.  I loved it.

First, I remember original reviews that said that the movie was laughing at a woman with a mental breakdown.  TOTALLY WRONG!!!  One of the main reasons this movie works is that it does not laugh at its protagonist, but is very much WITH her.  You really care about her--and much of that is because of the great performance by Renee Zellweger.

This is not a movie to ""classify""--and it is all the better for it.  If it had been played straight--as a drama or thriller, it wouldn't have worked.  The ""comedy"" approach was just right--although I wouldn't classify it simply as a comedy, even a ""dark"" one. It's too much multi-layered for that.  If anything, I was very moved by it.

For those looking for a nice, simple, easily classifiable flick, this won't be for you.  For those who are willing to check their expectations at the door and just go for a very satisfying ride, this is one's a winner.",1195776000,4,1102,4.400990099009901

1403484,5,B0000584ZH,"I must confess upfront that I really like Renee Zellweger.  There is something vulnerable in almost all of her performances, something sad and yet hopeful in her eyes.  Here she is a waitress with a straying, drug dealing, car salesman husband.  But no matter:  she's hopelessly in love with a doctor, rather, a character on an afternoon TV soap opera.  When her husband is killed, she sets out to Los Angeles with the delusion that she is somehow part of the doctor's/actor's life.  And she succeeds after a fashion.  She even dresses like a nurse, all white and crisp, and tries to get a job in a fictional hospital.  People think she is joking, but she is delusionally serious.  Then she saves an accident patient's life with a procedure she saw used in the soap opera....

The movie is often funny, with pathos, jeopardy, and a completely satisfying outcome.  My only criticism is with Chris Rock, who plays one of the men who is chasing Nurse Betty (Zellweger).  Chris Rock plays Chris Rock, the vulgar comedian whose only schtick is words that most people do not say in polite society.  I'm not amused by his comedy routine and I'm not entertained by his performance in this movie.",1188518400,3,1187,4.676328502415459

Renee Zellweger plays the title role, who after witnessing a murder goes on the road to meet and fall in love with a Doctor in a soap opera. The twist is that the trauma has affected her mind so she believes the soap opera character is a real person.

Of course it isn't as simple as that! Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play two dodgy characters who are trying to track Betty down. Chris Rock is not an actor I rate at all, but here with the always excellent Morgan Freeman he is watchable and the two actors work off each other very well. This is all done with some style and reminded me certain parts of the Coen Brothers movies, with perhaps just a hint of Tarantino.

The only downside for me was the music soundtrack, which was a little too gushing and romantic. However in all other respects this is a well constructed road movie that I throughly enjoyed and would happily recommend to anyone.",1187740800,2,992,4.356756756756757

It's too bad Renee changed too much since her naivete in this silly film within a film.  Lots of things have changed in six or seven years -- I know I have, that's for sure.  When I found this tape, I was shocked, thinking either I have changed or watching it in a theater added a bit of magic lacking on the tape.  Nobody is that un-sophisticated.  Perhaps her ""unknowing"" character was the story (may be every girl's fantasy) takes her on a journey into the world of soap operas.  She was too sweet to be true.  We don't all get what we wish for; this is a modern fairytale like 'Born Yesterday.'

Here, now, is Wink's ""A Reason to Love.""  He must have found this same tape in April out there when he accused another Betty of creating a soap opera.  Chuck is no Greg Kinnear.  All Bettys are not so dumb as to travel to California while in a dream state caused by Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  She becomes the character and fascinates Dr. David as she dresses like a nurse and successfully lands a job in a real hospital.

Betty was damaged emotionally by the sight of her real-life, abusive husband after he was savagely murdered.  Suddenly, she's free to be herself and spend some time in fairy land out in Los Angeles.  They found her charming and relentless, but she is not a Southerner.  After a foray into a world she does not understand, she lost her spontenanity and is devastated when her idol proves to be less than a god -- when he calls her crazy or deranged.  Later, he changes his mind.  Greg Kinnear is as handsome in this role as our George Clooney, only better.  She had told him ""If you were any handsomer, it'd be a crime; it's too bad you're such an -------.""

He inadvertendly sends Del's killers to her before she can safely get away in the car which has their drugs in the trunk.  The publicity of the ordeal at which both father and son murderers died gained her dream come true.  She and David were together for sixty-three episodes.

When life has become so dull and tame that millions fixate on TV as an alternate, this is precisely the kind of medicine we need.

Betty is a downtrodden but ever-optimistic waitress whose life shuttles between the humdrum (her job) and the abusive (her husband).

Her only refuge is a medical soap, which seems not only better but more real than her own.

When her husband the abuser himself is abused--right out of the picture--she cracks, and pursues her dream: the soap opera, which she now thinks is real.

Miraculously, she gets her foot in both the real medical world and the soap opera world (she can't tell the two apart).

Eventually, reality catches up, destroying her delusions, but (in the way of all good romance and comedy) allowing her to make her illusions real.

Interestingly, the most hard-bitten and seemingly realistic characters, the hit men, turn out to be the most deluded and fantasy-obsessed.

The movie is well acted and has a rather thoughtfull storyline, you can't help but take great liking to the storyline.

1403511,4,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty (2000), directed by Neil LaBute, follows a story about a waitress named Betty, played by Renee Zellweger, whom has witnessed the murder of her cheating husband Del, played by Aaron Eckhart. Betty suffered from post-traumatic stress after witnessing the murder, and becomes convinced that she must rejoin her once fianc Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear, who is actually a fictional character from a soap opera. Upon her journey across country to find Dr. Ravell, Betty exhibits characteristics that are often used to objectify women. In the beginning of the film, Del mistreats Betty by cheating on her, and demands her to play the submissive housewife role. Betty abides Del and remains devoted to him until her traumatic experience of watching him scalped and murdered, when she then develops a new attachment to another masculine character, David. Betty's main determination throughout the film is simply to be the woman in David's life, and goes as far as leaving her entire life behind
to pursue her supposed old flame.
The camera shots in Nurse Betty highlight my point stated above; about the shallow gender roles that are portrayed. Whenever Betty romantically gazes at Doctor David Ravell, whether on television or in person, the camera often does a close-up to her face to emphasize the influence the man has on the woman. All David has to do is stand there and Betty becomes captivated by his presence. This gives a sense of perceived control that the men have over women, which isn't rare in Hollywood film. Also, whenever David is framed by the camera, it is at a lower angle, suggesting the dominance and power that he possesses. Berger studied art's constant objectification of women; Nurse Betty only supports his point. The heroine in the movie, Betty, plays a submissive role to her fellow characters, and her character's identity is somewhat based on the men that are in her life. In the first half of the film, she simply played a wife. In the second half, she played a ""lost lover"" to a man she had to be reunited with.
In conclusion, Nurse Betty is a Hollywood film that portrays the female protagonist in an objectified way. The film also reproduces the existing stereotype of women, and the role of a wife, by the role Betty plays in her relationships with the male characters.",1084233600,,2320,4.875949367088608

Her obsession with Dr. David Ravell turns into a quest that takes her to Hollywood where she encounters this fictional character whom she believes is her lover. Since men are surveyors of women, Betty felt the need to conform into society's depiction of a ""perfect"" woman for this encounter.  Renee Zellweger's character represents a woman who makes the pursuit of a man her reason of existence.  This movie like many others symbolizes the typical woman who is seen as needy and reliant upon a man.  Betty Sizemore exemplifies this stereotypical female character.  The other obvious stereotype that can be seen from the movie comes from the title Nurse Betty.  It is not accidental that in the movie the doctor is played by a man and the nurse is a woman.  This in itself is a microcosm of our society where many believe these careers are gender specific.

1403513,1,B0000584ZH,"The movie ""Nurse Betty"" tells the story of a young woman so disenchanted with her life that after witnessing the violent death of her husband her mind take dissociative measurers and she thinks she is the ex-finance of a soap opera character.  She leaves a dead husband, killed by two vigilantes, Charlie and Wesley, and her small town, and makes her way across country to Hollywood, all the time followed by the same two men who killed her husband.  She meets the man who plays her soap opera sweetheart, Dr. David Ravell, and continues to believe that he is a character, not the actor, George McCord.  It is not until she is offered a part on the set that she comes to realize that this is all acting.  This is followed by the requisite shoot out, between her and the vigilantes who have stalked her across country, and eventually everything works out.
 Although the movie is rife with social commentary, and the way they portray women is typical-Hollywood, what is most interesting is the relationship that one of the vigilantes, Charlie has with Betty.  At some point in the chase he becomes delusional about a relationship with her, much as she her become delusional about having a relationship with Dr. David Ravell.  It is interesting just as Betty sees Ravell as a way out of her life, Charlie sees Betty as a way out of his.  This plays on a very old theme that can be seen time and time again both in culture itself and in cultural products of a black man wanting a white woman.  There are no mistakes in film, Betty didn't just happen to be white, nor did Charlie just happen to be black.  The director cast them this way.  Just as Betty is pursuing an impossible dream to escape reality by falling in love with an imaginary character, Charlie is doing the same by imagining a relationship with Betty.  It is one of the most blatant reinforcements of racial divides that Hollywood has come out with in awhile, but it is veiled just enough to make it possible to ignore.
 Over this entire movie was trite, and negative to all minority groups portrayed in it.  The Latina character was portrayed as something of a slut, the small-town folks were bumbling idiots, the one white woman from LA was a leech, the two vigilantes were thugs, and one was delusional, and Betty was seen as a small child who needed to be cared for.  If you do watch this movie, watch it with your eyes open, and you'll see all the stereotypes that are thrown around staring back at you.",1084233600,2,2469,4.5292792792792795
1403514,4,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty, directed by Neil LaBute in 2000, presents the internalization of social structures. The film portrays to viewers the role that they have as consumers of images. We see how Betty views visual images and visual culture such as television as a commodity, something that can be bought or sold. She was consumed by a soap opera, and eventually she no longer saw the difference between watching it and being in it. LaBute brings to attention the objectification and surveying of females, specifically Betty, as well as stereotypical gender roles.
 Betty is a waitress in a small town, married to a car-dealer who treats her poorly. He gets involved with a drug deal and is ultimately killed in his home while Betty is in the next room. As Betty watches her husband's murder, and simultaneously watches A Reason to Love, her obsession turns into a post-traumatic reality. She proceeds with her life, actually believing she is a nurse from the show, unaware of her husband's murder. She goes to Los Angeles searching desperately for her ""ex-fianc"" Dr. David Ravell, who is a character from the soap opera as well.
 The majority of the time that Betty is presented in the film it is from the perspective of a male. First from the eyes of her no-good husband, through the sheriff and reporter that follow her for her story, and mostly from the view of the two men who killed her husband, and are now following her because of the drugs that she unknowingly has in the trunk of her husband's car. In Ways of Seeing, John Berger presents the notion that ""men act, women appear."" Men survey women before treating them, while women turn themselves into an object of vision; a sight.  Betty knows that she is being both observed and judged by society; therefore she turns herself into someone admirable to others. This reflects Berger's idea that women are defined by how they are viewed by men. Women watch themselves being looked at and change themselves to appeal to the male perspective, as Betty did, first for her husband, and then for David Ravell, the TV actor she pursues.  Nurse Betty plays on many of the stereotypes of our society. Betty is an attractive young woman, and a typical ""blonde."" She is fascinated with a soap-opera, as much of our culture is. The labels she carries from housewife to nurse to love object are all conventional female roles.",1084060800,2,2361,4.751219512195122
1403515,3,B0000584ZH,"Neil LaBrute and John C. Richard's comedic Nurse Betty presents its viewers with an intriguing question: How much do we let our lives revolve around media, and when is it time to snap out of it, step back, and take control of our own lives?
Opening with a shot from a TV-series-within-a-movie scene, the film taunts those audience members who immediately begin to latch onto the ""wrong"" characters until the scene suddenly waxes incredibly ""fake.""  Whoops! We're supposed to fall in love with Betty, not these crazy, one-dimensional characters.
Yet those audience members will be the first to laugh at Betty when they see how wrapped up she's become in the TV series ""A Reason to Love"" in order to escape from the harsh reality that's surrounding her.  Ha, ha-How can she possibly think that ""George"" is ""David,"" and how can he not see it?  But wait-Have we forgotten already that ""George"" is really Greg Kinnear?
While the viewer's ambivalent gaze increases the comedy of the film, it causes problems when deciding whether this film criticizes, or simply reproduces, the messages and stereotypes we've all seen and heard before.  If we look at it with an analytical eye, we could argue that the film is a clever critique of society on the part of the writer, director, and actors.  However, because this film portrays everything we expect from a Hollywood film: the crazy blonde in distress, the bad guys, some twists here and there, and the neatly tied-up ending, and because the audience does begin to sympathize with the believable characters, the film seems at points to reinforce the stereotypical view of women as objects seen through the male gaze.
While the film tries to rebel against some stereotypes, the messages are countered by the images we see throughout the film.  For example, in a conversation between Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), Wesley superficially describes Betty as, ""You know, blonde, thin, whatever?"" to which Charlie responds, ""Slow down: blonde, thin, yeah.  Did they say anything about style?  Did they say anything about grace?""  The conversation makes the audience think-just for a brief moment-about what's important in life.  Also, the film allows us to sympathize with the ""bad guys"" during their road trip and especially at the film's end.  However, we still have the typical soap-opera-watching waitress whose dreams have disintegrated in order to please her male partner-first, her good-for-nothing husband, and then a TV actor who's full of himself.
Renee Zellweger's character Betty, while played terrifically, was scripted somewhat one-dimensionally.  It fit the perfect role of women as defined by John Berger's theory that ""men act, women appear""-that is, while men are defined by the jobs they have their successes, etc., women are defined solely by how they're perceived by a male eye, which, in most cases, means for their looks.  Objectified mainly in the lens of other male characters, Betty becomes a housewife, a criminal, an actress, a nurse, a skinny blonde, a love object, a delusional freak, etc., but we never really see the ""true"" Betty for very long.  Simply mirroring the frames that others cage her in and the pedestals that others place her on, Betty perpetuates what Jeremy Bentham has termed ""panopticism.""  That is, she is aware that she's being watched and judged by others and as a result, fits herself into a mold that's commendable by society.  Even though she is delusional in parts of the movie, her dreams reflect those that society wants her to pursue-nurse instead of doctor, TV actress, etc.-and her reality even more stereotypically reflects a woman ""in her place.""  The only ways that she escapes this ubiquitous gaze is by entering into her own delusion of who'd she like to become-a dainty nurse still admired by all-and, when she realizes the futility in this, to literally escape instead of redefining herself as a strong female character.  While it's true that she ""do[es]n't need anybody, because [she's] got [her]self,"" I remain doubtful that she's going to believe that and whether she'll be able to live the life she wants.  While she does pursue what at first sight is a ""successful"" career, does she really pursue her original dreams?

1403516,4,B0000584ZH,"What a pleasant surprise of a movie. Difficult to think of a genre I'd label it into, it takes a little road-less-travelled of its own. Part drama, part comedy (and both Freeman and Chris Rock are hilarious in a not very intentionally funny way), and part suspense murder chase -- plus a subplot about psychologically dysfunctionally fantasy of Hollywood.
I read other reviews here and the one reason some critics savage this movie is that it defies all the usual by-the-numbers stereotypes. Sure, the theme is somewhat doozy but the way it has been handled on film is immaculate -- the movie flows quickly and is edge-of-the-seat entertainment and almost all characters are very convincing -- from the quirky small-town Kansas sheriff to the protagonists Renee and Freeman.
In fact, I particularly enjoyed the protagonists, their stories intertwine in an offbeat way. He fantasizes about her as she fantasizes about a soap star. They both set off in pursuit of their ideals with unpredictable results. Renee is sweet without being smarmy, there is a naivete to her in this which is not cloying. And Morgan has seen better days and is the victim of his own lifestyle which he would leave in a second if his fantasy were possible and a deep part of him knows it is not.
The underlying almost parodic message is about how we get sidetracked in life when some thing becomes too painful through just plain circumstances or through poor decisions. Pay attention to the words spoken by Morgan Freeman's character in his last scene.
Its fun to watch movies that take risks and this sly dig definitely does! What a fabulous feast of film.",1081296000,2,1630,4.825

In some sort of psychotic fantasy, that even he doesn't pick up on, she is thrust into a relationship with him and, for a time, happy. But darkness is on the horizon, as the perpetrators of the crime she witnessed are hunting her down. Morgan Freeman does a great acting job and Chris Rock adds humor, but only a little of it. In the meantime we have the sheriff's department in Kansas hunting her down, thinking she is the perpetrator of the crime.

They make this weird and engrossing road movie into a strange and deprave look at obsession, and popular culture. Considering Labute past work, this is no way as profound or as powerful as In the Company of Men and The Shape of Things but it's miles better than his lackluster love epic Possession.",1073433600,,498,4.670454545454546
1403519,2,B0000584ZH,"OK, I've dug most of Labute's other stuff, especially his newest, ""The Shape of Things"". ...And I think this movie is well-directed.
And there's no question that the acting is top-notch. Rock hangs in there in a dramatic role. Freeman and Zelwegger are great as always. Kinnear does a good job.
Even my major criteria of a good movie was satisfied, in that I never knew what was coming next. I mean I had no clue what was coming next the whole time.
And yet I didn't enjoy this one. I mean, it was an unpleasant experience for me. And I think the problem lies in the basic premise.
We're asked to go along with an impossible plot. And that's ok. I've got no problem with that. Sometimes it's really great to get swept along by the force of a story that is based in fantasy. But then, at times, we're asked to see this one as though it's real. Betty's long-standing delusion is fantastical, right? But when Betty meets the soap star, for example, the fantasy stops. Labute fosters a palpable tension in the meeting. We dive into realism. Later, Betty saves a guy's life because she thinks she's a nurse, right? That's fantasy. I think we could all agree that she wouldn't have realistically been able to do the work she did on that dude. And yet, this whole time, the guy's spurting blood. He's in extreme pain.
Those are just two of the many examples of this going on. I see fantasy and realism as the opposite ends of the spectrum of storytelling. I think you can make a great movie anywhere on that scale. But I think that you have to figure out where you're gonna lie on that spectrum and stay in that general area. This movie continually jars us back and forth from one to the other. And, though the acting is skilled, different actors play their roles at different levels of reality. Freeman comes off as if he's acting in a drama, but Kinnear thinks he's in a comedy.
I'm still baffled by this movie. Some reviewers I respect liked it a lot. But watching this one in the theater was an entirely unpleasant experience for me. ...And I'm easily pleased.",1067040000,4,2057,4.444444444444445
1403520,4,B0000584ZH,"that is very different from the cynical first two efforts of Director Neil LaBute.  LaBute is working with someone else's script this time, and that may be the reason this film was more successful than his first two efforts.  A dark comedy with some surprisingly graphic violence, this is definitely a departure from his character driven ensembles that have you liking absolutely no one.
It's hard not to like Betty -- she's a down on her luck waitress that has an absolutely golden presence.  Who couldn't like her?  It's difficult to know whether Zellweger's more likeable here, as Bridget, or in her ""Chicago"" role.  In a very short time, she has established herself as leading lady material, and the camera loves her.  As Betty, her crush on a soap opera star (Greg Kinnear as Actor George McCord) who is a doctor in his role, becomes more serious when her low-life husband is killed by two mobsters.  Betty witnesses the murder, and unknowingly takes the car that has the merchandise the mobsters are searching for.  When Betty leaves her small-town life for LA, she's disassociated from reality and is going to find ""Dr. Ravell"" her real love.
Kinnear is charming and alternately confused and attracted to Betty (who acts as a nurse in the soap opera).  Morgan Freeman is terrific as Charlie, from the mob, who can't help his attraction to Betty, despite his mission.  Only Chris Rock, who plays Charlie's son, seems to be miscast, in a whiny and bitter role.  Chris -- you CAN play comedy!  The screen shines when Zellweger is on it, and you are ultimately drawn into her world and are there when it comes crashing down around her.
LaBute did a marvelous job with the film, but the DVD extras are sparse and some of the deleted scenes are truly distasteful.  Alison Janney is wasted in a throw away role, but LaBute does manage to find a small role for his favorite actor, Aaron Eckhart (he's been in all LaBute's films) as the smarmy husband.  John C. Richards and James Flamberg won at Cannes for the screenplay, and it does surprise in the way it tells an unusual story.
Not for everyone, especially for those looking for light comedy. Those viewers will find the violence distasteful.",1059177600,9,2195,4.727034120734908
1403531,3,B0000584ZH,"""Nurse Betty"" is a good taste tester as Neil LaBute continues to push the envelope.  After watching Gweneth Paltrow & Aaron Eckhart in LaBute's ""Possession,"" I was curious what I'd missed with this DVD.  Whether James Flamberg deserved the best screenplay prize at Cannes in 2000 for this script, I'm not sure.  Usually, writers are told to avoid making your main character crazy because the audience would have to be crazy to relate to them.  If there's a difficulty accessing the film, it would be that.
As far as acting execution, the only one who I consistently fail to connect with is Chris Rock.  The one deleted scene on the DVD where he talks about sex with Asian women is about as gross as I could imagine; and I wasn't that pleased with his scenes left in the movie.  The deleted flap scene where his skull explodes was more relief than bother.  Aaron Eckhart with a bizarre haircut gets the LaBute obnoxious treatment & performs admirably as the dense self-centered husband who leaves his scalp on the floor.  The supporting character Tia Texada as Rosa does a wonderful job as Zellweger's L.A. roommate.  Allison Janney as producer Lyla has a limited amount to do, but does it wonderfully.  Kathleen Wilhoite as best friend Sue Ann does her usual great job with her distinctive raspy voice.  Crispin Glover from ""Back to the Future"" who is creeping people out right now with ""Willard"" does a great supporting job as news reporter Roy.
The leads are also excellent.  Renee Zellweger is interesting to watch, and has that great Doris Day thing going on.  The film hinges on our believing her disassociation from reality; and she does it so sweetly that we do.  Morgan Freeman could read the phone book; and he'd be great, which he is here again.  Greg Kinnear gets to play a variety of levels as Dr. David Ravell on the soap ""A Reason to Love"" and as actor George McCord who is charmed by Betty.
Obviously, this is a strange little tale.  My wife kept saying in disbelief when it was over, ""I thought it was a comedy.""  It works because of the wonderful acting, the distinctiveness of LaBute's directorial style, and the originality of the screenplay.  That said, it doesn't completely hang together.  I liked it anyway.  Enjoy!",1048118400,4,2238,4.704370179948586

Nurse Betty was a stupid movie with a ridiculous plot, and I couldn't get into it. Morgan Freeman had an unusually extremely foul mouth, which made me lose a lot of respect for him. I expected the foul language from Chris Rock, but not from Morgan Freeman. Renee Zellweger played a ditsy and stupid character with such a ridiculous mindset. Greg Kinnear had a flat character as well. Nurse Betty lacked extremely. It is not a kid movie either.

1403534,5,B0000584ZH,"Seldom does a movie combine the tragic and comic elements as well as ""Nurse Betty."" To say that this is a story about pursuit of dreams is to focus only on the first half of the movie. It's about a bit more. It's a story about a person coming of age and pursuing her dream AWAKE.
Betty (brilliantly played by Zellweger) had been pursuing her dream ever since her husband, Del (Eckhart), was killed. She left Kansas City for LA in search of Dr. Ravell (Kinnear) whom she believed to be her ex-finance. All went pretty well until her dreamy pursuit of dream finally ended with an ugly scene in which George the actor playing Dr. Ravell was cruelly reprimanding Betty for her inability to act. Only after then did Betty wake up and go back to her real (but new) life. The final scene of the movie showed Betty enjoying herself in Rome. And that's really the dream that she should have been pursuing.
A similar message was manifested through another character, Charlie the hit man played by Morgan Freeman. Though even he himself admitted he was a ""garbage man of human condition,"" Charlie was dreaming of an unrealistic future with Betty. He tracked her down more because of his admiration for her than for the drug stashed in Betty's car. In the end, he had to pay the price for his dreamy pursuit of his impossible dream. Not only him but also his son was killed.
While pursuing one's own dream is a good thing, it could be dangerous if one is not awake and only blindly follows his impulse. It's important to draw the distinction between the real world and the imagined world. It's easy to be led to chase dreams in the perfect, simple imagined world. But what distinguishes an achiever from a pure dreamer is the ability to recognize, accept and reconcile the imperfection of the real world and resist the temptation to keep oneself locked in a dream.
Besides the delicious blend of tragic and comic elements, the movie also offers some great performances of its cast. Zellweger is almost impeccable. Freeman, as usual, does a tremendous job and Rock is seriously funny. It's a great movie overall.",1041811200,4,2099,4.614973262032086

Betty (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), a waitress in Kansas, is married to a crooked car salesman named Del (Aaron Eckhart). Del is cheating on her. Betty, unaware and far too nice to ever cheat on him, is in love with a doctor on her favourite soap opera. One night as Betty is watching TV, two professional criminals turn up to the house and kill Del for trying to play them on a drug deal.
Betty, watching through the door, goes into a state of shock. Fantasy and reality twist in her mind, and she blanks out the murder and decides to head out to LA to find her soap opera doctor, whom she believes is her ex-fianc&eacute;e. The problem is, the car she takes is the car which Del stored the drugs in. So the criminals, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), follow her trail across America.
Betty, in love with the fantasy of a doctor, thinks only of him and meanwhile Charlie begins to think only of Betty, after seeing a photograph of her and building up a fantasy version of her in his head. Even though Betty is the one who is ""crazy"", they are really both on the trail of their dreams, in love with people they don't know.
The film manages to avoid any clich&eacute;s and creates characters we really do care about, and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's performance is pitch-perfect.

I always like Morgan Freeman. It is amazing that he made me feel something for the horrid character he plays here. Likewise, I believe Greg Kinnear is one of the best male actors out there--but he is largely wasted in his role here (although his ""bad acting"" in the soap scenes is priceless).
The largest problem I have with this movie is that there is no one to really like (with the possible exception of the reporter played by the guy who played Michael J. Fox's dad in Back to the Future). All of these characters are unredeeming. Even Betty, who spends most of the movie just being nuts, sells her soul in the end. The movie is just kind of pasty and tasteless.
This brings me to the special features. The one thing I truly enjoyed about the DVD--which actually took me a few minutes to stop laughing over--was the ""soap opera episodes."" The opening sequence on each of them is just hysterical.
However, that said--the deleted scenes are just wretched and disgusting (I guess the movie could have been a whole lot worse). The ""flap"" scene is one I wish I had not hit play for.

1403551,4,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty is a smart, satirical and dark comedy that threatens at times to veer off track. Each time it does so, it winds up redeeming itself, but the result is a movie that does not manage to entertain consistently throughout. It also has an odd way of both repelling and engaging the viewer. Its strongest point is its originality, and that's saying something in a year [2000] that was pretty predictable at the movies.
Renee Zellweger is Betty Sizemore, a small town waitress whose husband, Del [Aaron Eckhart] is a crass, petty man. He owns a used car lot, and when Betty asks if she can borrow a 1997 Buick LeSabre off the lot so she can celebrate her birthday with a girlfriend, he tells her a cheaper car should do her just fine. Betty sneaks off with the Buick anyway, but her friend is unable to go out with her. She returns home, planning to return the car the next day, and begins to watch a videotape of her favorite soap opera. It's clear that in Betty's drab and uneventful life, this program is almost the center of her existence. When Del comes home, Betty, who is in the den, turns the TV down but continues to watch. Unbeknownst to her, the two men Del has brought to the house turn out to be there to collect on a big drug deal Del screwed some folks on. The guys are Charlie and his son Wesley [Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock], and in a miscommunication between father and son, Del winds up dead in the living room. Hearing the shots, Betty peeks through a doorway. She sees them. They don't see her.
Betty goes into a post traumatic shock in which the world completely alters for her. After the sheriff and the local newspaper reporter [Pruitt Taylor Vane and Crispin Glover] have been in the house awhile investigating the murder, Betty suddenly smiles, thanks them for dropping by and leaves. In her mind there has been no crime. Suddenly, she believes that she was once engaged to Dr. David Ravell, a lead character on her beloved soap opera. Betty takes off in the Buick for Los Angeles in search of David and begins a series of very strange adventures. Charlie and Wesley are soon in hot pursuit because they know something she doesn't...
Zellweger was a wonderful choice to play Bette. With her wispy but raspy voice and her little girl lost looks, she is ideal in a movie that is liberally laced with references to The Wizard of Oz. Greg Kinnear gives some nice touches to George McCord, the actor who play Dr. Ravell. He's a man whose ego has caused him to lose sight of what's important. Freeman, master that he is, manages to bring empathy to a character that really doesn't deserve any. I say he doesn't deserve any because I have never been able to buy into the Hollywood cliche in which a guy who makes a living as a hit man is, underneath it all, just a regular guy trying to get by in life. I also have a difficult time finding such a character amusing.
It is hard to peg Nurse Betty, and that's okay. If it's a family comedy you're after, forget it. If you like your comedy on the fresh and quirky side, by all means give Betty a try.",1016323200,,3072,4.4007029876977155

Not knowing of the contents in her car???? Too much. Yep, they truly missed their calling on the title there. Despite all of that, I really liked the movie. I loved Morgan Freeman's character. He did the job, yet started having feelings for this woman, and Chris Rock will always be, no matter what, hilarious. But this woman, I had to shake my head and laugh at her.

1403571,4,B0000584ZH,"The best thing about ""Nurse Betty"" is that you never quite know where it's going.  Its loose and freeform structure allows the writers, John C. Richards and James Flamberg, to fashion their work from a wide range of disparate moods and styles - and the strain rarely shows.  One can question the appropriateness of a particularly gruesome scene early on in the film, but, for the most part, ""Nurse Betty"" wins us over with its originality, sweetness and charm.  The first element is provided by the screenwriters, but the second two come principally from the film's star, Renee Zellweger, who, as always, radiates the kind of beauty and vulnerability of spirit that have made her a major star for our time.
Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore, a waitress working in a caf in Kansas, who escapes the grim reality of her marriage to a callous philanderer by blanking herself into her favorite soap opera and fantasizing about her favorite soap opera character, the handsome Dr. David Ravell, played by Greg Kinnear.  When Betty witnesses the brutal murder of her husband, she lapses into a state of psychosomatic denial, becoming convinced not only that the world of her TV program is real but that she must travel to Los Angeles to reunite with her former fianc, Dr. Ravell himself.  Thus begins Betty's bizarre cross-country odyssey, followed closely on her heels by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, the men responsible for her husband's death.
But the odyssey Betty undergoes is not merely a geographical one - for she also takes a journey deep into the recesses of comic madness.  As a result, while there is humor in much of what she goes through, there is also pain - and the writers and the actress hit on both notes perfectly.  Thus, while Betty's confusion about what is real and what is fantasy often leads to comic misunderstandings, it also leads to the kind of fear, misapprehension and insecurity that can accompany irrationality.
In a similar way, the writers knock us off balance with their conception of the Freeman and Rock characters.  Here are men - one a hotheaded, cold-blooded, calculated killer, the other a professional criminal who admits to knocking off those people who ""deserve it"" - who come across at times as quietly convincing humorous charmers.  ""Nurse Betty"" is not always a ""comfortable"" comedy.
With its multitude of characters, settings and tones, ""Nurse Betty"" sometimes seems as if it will rip apart at the seams.  Yet, thanks to the skilled hand of director Neil LaBute, this never happens.  In fact, the film has an expansive, almost epic quality rarely found in a comedy.  Not every element in ""Nurse Betty"" works equally well, but for its ambition, scope and originality, it is a film well worth checking out.",1001203200,6,2744,4.890086206896552
1403572,2,B0000584ZH,"We didn't expect very much from this movie except for perhaps a decent 'popcorn' movie.  There is a lot of Star power in this movie: Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, and a few more solid actors.  This offbeat 'comedy' is flat out dead in the first half.  We were reaching for the remote to shut off the DVD, but decided to continue since it was a weeknight and didn't have time to restart another movie.  Many movies start off stong and end weak.  This movie, however, improved from a 1 star movie to a 2.5 star movie in the second half.  Although I normally enjoy Renee Zellweger very much, it is hard to determine whether she was the victim of a bad script, or simply could not pull off roleplaying a person with dissociative amnesia--she simply portrayed a bimbo the entire movie.  I've seen her perfom much better in movies like ""Jerry Macguire"".  I half to chalk it up to the terrible script or dissapointing directing.  Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock were also dissapointing in this movie, so I'm chalking it up to a terrible script.  The movie finally pulls together towards the end, but still falls well flat of falling into any deserving category; this movie doesn't qualify for either a comedy or drama, and simply falls into 'no man's land'.",1000080000,7,1277,4.635555555555555

Some reviewers have complained about the violence in the film, but these elements are justified and logical....the people involved in the violence generally get what they deserve (which kinda bugs me about lighthearted films where someone dies....the person that dies always is set up as a complete jerk, just to make the audience feel better...Boo!).
Anyway, definitely a quirky, vivid film worth the acclaim it has received. All actors involved do a fine job (especially Morgan).  Don't, however, expect a hilarious performance out of Chris Rock--his character is somewhat unpleasant and cynical.  However, he pulls it off well...just don't expect the humor he is known for.
The extras are pretty good, too...the soap opera episodes are included (9 of them, about 5 minutes each), as well as commentary tracks by the director and cast, and a second track with the director and film crew.  The movie trailers and TV spots looked totally unfamiliar to me--I don't really remember this film being in theaters!",997747200,2,1123,5.120218579234972
1403574,5,B0000584ZH,"This is an adorable, if somewhat edgy, comedy from a clever and witty script by John C. Richards, crisply directed by the very talented Neil LaBute, proving that he can handle comedy just as adroitly as he can the art house movie.
Rene Zellweger stars as Betty Sizemore, a sort of Doris Day of the 21st century, a waitress from Kansas whose fantasy life centers around Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), star of a TV soap opera called, ""A Reason to Live,"" to such a fanatical degree that she has memorized lines from the show after watching the tapes over and over again.  (This will come in handy later on.)  Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play a father-son team of cocaine-dealing hit men who ignite the premise of the movie by murdering Betty's slimy used car salesman husband, played by Aaron Eckhart, who starred in In the Company of Men (1997), also directed by Neil LaBute.  Chris Rock is a comedic psychopath, and Freeman a fatherly murderer whose favorite dictum is ""three in the head, you know they're dead.""  One of the amazing and characteristic things about Morgan Freeman is that even while playing a professional criminal, he manages to sound like the wisest, gentlest man you ever knew.
True, the plot relies heavily on co-incidence (Betty copping the keys to the Buick that just happens to have the goods in the trunk), precise timing (meeting Dr. David and entourage at exactly the right moment), and some questionable psychology (Betty's partial and convenient amnesia).  But such contrivances should be written off as poetic license and ignored.  After all, who would criticize Shakespeare for the tortured plots of his comedies?  More significantly, what makes this work is the cleverness of the plot melded well with the personalities of the characters (while gently satirizing them), and some very funny dialogue.  My favorite line is when Freeman, looking gravely at a picture of the disappeared little miss Nurse Betty, soberly remarks to Rock, ""We may be dealing with a cunning, ruthless woman here.""  I wonder, could it be that some of the pseudonymous (and humorless) reviewers who trashed this movie here and at IMDb are jealous, out-of-work screen writers?
An observation and a question:  Rene Zellweger has the kind of on-screen presence to delight the most jagged heart.  And who really is the reigning queen of contemporary filmland comedy, Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon?  They are both brilliant.  Witherspoon is a little more over the top while Zellweger is more impish.  It would be interesting to see them trade roles, say, Zellweger as goody-goody A-student Tracy Flick in Election (1999) and Witherspoon as Nurse Betty.  Too bad something like that can't be done.
Incidentally, the song, ""Ca Sera, Sera"" heard in the background won an academy award for best song in the Hitchcock thriller, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), starring James Stewart and  Doris Day.  The reason it reappears here is not entirely clear, but the resemblance of the wonderfully naive Nurse Betty to the on- and off-screen Doris Day (who also had a hit recording of ""Ca Sera, Sera,"") goes beyond the strawberry blond hair to a kind of irrepressible innocence.  In Nurse Betty, however, the Doris Day world of white picket fences and monogamy is given a contemporary spin.  Although this is to some extent a romantic comedy, it is one in which the answer to the question, Who gets the girl? is one never seen in a Doris Day flick.
Bottom line: if you can watch this without laughing old loud and crying some real tears, you need to get your hard drive fixed.",997401600,6,3570,4.87107438016529
1403575,5,B0000584ZH,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time, and it still wowed me. The wacky, off-beat script is handled perfectly by an outstanding cast, and one cannot help but be drawn into Nurse Betty's touching journey to find another, only, in the end, to find herself.
I sat in awe of the superb performance given by Renee Zellweger. The movie is worth buying just to see what a fine actress can do with a challenging role. Wisely, the director gives her the camera, and the results are magnificent.
Sincere and balanced performances by the entire cast make ""Nurse Betty"" a fine example of ensemble acting at its best.
I greatly admire Morgan Freeman, and he, as usual, gives a wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear is also to be commended for the absolute mastery of his character. His work with Renee Zellweger is of the highest calibar.
I was particularly moved by the scene in the car when Renee Zellweger talks with Greg Kinnear about a day she spent with her mother - what a wonderful moment of superb acting.
I was also impressed by the fine use of music in the film to help create mood.
This is a movie not everyone will like, but I think it will hold a special place in the hearts of those it touches. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is the needless use of profanity.

1403577,3,B0000584ZH,"I was expecting a dark comedy (my favorite kind), but this movie didn't really fit the bill.  In fact, the core story of Renee Zellweger's character going a little nuts after seeing her husband brutally killed and trying to join the world of her favorite soap opera which she suddenly thinks is real is actually pretty sweet.  That's because of Renee's excellent performance.  She brings such genuine empathy to the character that it's hard to find her character's predicament funny.  Yes, it's amusing how she manages to blithely insinuate herself into the make-believe soap world without anyone figuring out how truly nuts she is, but thanks to Renee's performance,  I was also rooting for her to be successful in her bizarre endeavor.
As for the parallel storyline involving Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, it had it's funny moments, but it was nowhere close to fully utlizing Rock's darkly comic talent.  I felt like any number of actors could have played this role; I would have much preferred to see Rock make it his own.  Freeman was wonderful, of course.  Unfortunately, these two were involved in some incredibly violent scenes - much more gruesome than you would expect to see in a movie that bills itself as a comedy.
All in all, I enjoyed the movie, but I can see why it wasn't more of a success despite some great performances.  It was too schizophrenic to be either a successful comedy or a succesful action/adventure movie.  Do check out the cast and director's discussion of the movie on the DVD .

She is even in love with a character from the show named David Ravell. Apart from her dreams, her real life is not so great. Her husband is a cheating scum bag who leaves her alone on her birthday. When Betty witnesses a horrible crime, her shock transports her into the world of ""A Reason To Love"". She thinks she is Nurse Betty and sets off to find her long lost love Doctor David Ravell.
My Opinion:  Nurse Betty was a lot different than I expected. In fact it was just plain different. I don't know if ""Dark Comedy"" correctly describes it, but it comes close. It has both comedic parts and violent serious parts. The violent scenes are quite serious but they are surrounded by lighter scenes. Betty's life is quite sad in the beginning of the film. She goes through a transformation that brings out her true self. This is a very intelligent and creative movie. Chris Rock is at his best in this one as is Renee Zellweger.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 2.25:1, DD5.1. Good picture quality and sound. Two separate commentary tracks, deleted scenes, episodes of ""A Reason to Love"", and trailers. The extras on this DVD are really great.
What You Should Do:  See it if you can handle off beat movies. It is a bit different from the mainstream romantic comedy so be prepared. If you are a film buff in general, and enjoy intelligent movies, then you are in for a treat.

1403583,3,B0000584ZH,"After only two films, I had already considered Neil LaBute to be one of America's sharpest and most cynical social critics and satirists.  However, this is his first film based on somebody else's script and even though the social critique and satire is still there, it is overly familiar and not as incisive as I would expect from a LaBute film.  Perhaps I'm too tough on him.  If this film had been directed by anyone else, I might very well be singing its praises.  That's because the movie is actually very funny and involving, with a storyline that exists on several different levels.  I guess I just expected more from LaBute.  I think he can do so much more than recycle the accidental-celebrity-type story straight out from 'Being There'.  I also think LaBute is more interesting when he is cynical and mean-spirited.  The happy, morally-correct ending in which all the loose ends are tied up is something you would expect from a typical Hollywood shill, not a maverick such as LaBute.  And is there really a need for another social critique on the deleterious effects of television on American life?  The plot has more than its share of contrivances, but give LaBute credit for getting as much mileage from them as possible, although I still could have done without the Crispin Glover and Pruitt Taylor Vince characters.  The strong performances from Zelweger, Kinnear and Freeman also go a long way in selling the implausible plot twists (perhaps my complaints about the unrealistic plot might seem irrational to some as the film can be seen as a fable, but I would argue that one cannot remain emotionally detached after witnessing a gruesome scalping).

1403584,4,B0000584ZH,"NURSE BETTY is a clever study of the human capacity to avoid reality by inventing alternative universes for the self. The film's focus is Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger), a small town waitress in Kansas who prefers the world of her favorite soap opera to that of her own as the chief doormat of a philandering husband. After witnessing his violent death at the hands of drug dealers, she is emotionally propelled headlong into her soap opera world, taking off across country unaware of the stash of drugs in her trunk. Her goal is to reach the ""doctor"" of the soap opera (Greg Kinnear) and her vision is strong enough to take her all the way to the actor's inner sanctum where her delusion fits neatly with his narcissistic notion that what he does is high concept art.
Meanwhile, hot on Betty's trail are her husband's killers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), the elder fancying himself a statesman of intuiting, building up Betty as a worthy adversary, the other a rash kid with no sense of proportion. Betty does have friends who care about her and try to give her a clue but here the film makes another insightful observation: clues roll off most people. Some never do learn, some have to crash into reality before they finally get it. Betty finally gets it.
The film is filled with amazing performances. Every last one is laudable but Zellweger and Freeman are stand outs. The dialogue is well written and handled, especially by Freeman who is given some nice riffs. The visual references to the themes abound. There is a natural sunlit glow to the country roads Betty takes to LA ala the yellow brick road to Oz. Kinnear's actor proves to be as short as the Wizard, a fact referenced by the contrast with the height and command of Allison Janney as the soap opera's producer/writer. Less subtle are Betty's waitress and nurse uniforms that are unmistakably Dorothy.
Ultimately, there is an unevenness to the film. The violence is too jarringly realistic to fit comfortably with the comedy. It could use that FARGO touch. The allusions to THE WIZARD OF OZ are witty but intermittent. Those who want a film that gives them something to critique with pals but not in film class should enjoy this. Those who want a pleasant comedy will have that but will not be able to enjoy it thoroughly given the unsettling nature of the violence.",992304000,2,2337,4.702439024390244

1403586,4,B0000584ZH,"Reading these reviews on Amazon for this movie I am pleased to see my opinion borne out.  But let me explain it in my own way, nonetheless.
This is a movie that I liked and found quite charming but that I did not expect most people to like very much, simply because it is movie for a certain taste.  The disturbing violence early in the movie really harms the ability to enjoy the characters played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  I accept the director's justification for this violence as found in the DVD commentary during the scene.  It does indeed, as he argues, make the traumatic effect upon Betty believable.  Unfortunately it simultaneously traumatizes most of the audience.  It is perplexing to figure how the movie could've been shot differently to both convey as effectively and believably a sense of trauma and a resulting dissociative transformation, and yet remain a comedy.
With that said, I found the adventures of Nurse Betty from that point on to be really charming and surreal.  She really won me over.
The value of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's performances was not really comedy but character.  For the most part they are not funny, but their performances are interesting, as are their characters' developments.  Chris Rock is a brilliant comedian, possibly the best famous comedian performing right now, yet in this movie he transforms himself into a positively chilling figure.  On rare occassions he is wonderfully funny, but for the most part he is cold and disturbing.  Quite an impressive acting job to depart so clearly from his stage persona.  It may be that he was too good of a murderer that some comedy was lost.  This may be signs of some broader acting abilities to showcase in the future.  Yet that would be a mixed blessing for then his comedy would be missed, as it was for the most part in this film.  Morgan Freeman's character is bizarre and complex and becomes humorous only through time, and still is likable in only a reserved way.  Comedy requires villains that are less truly frigthening, with weaknesses to make them laughable and endearing.  Freeman's work better than Rock's, but neither are enough to keep the movie consistently funny to balance the fright factor.
Renee Zellwegger on the other hand is simultaneously a comic and dramatic revelation in this film.  What a marvelous actress she is proving to be, completely departing from her Jerry Maguire role here and showing herself in Bridgette Jones's Diary and Me, Myself and Irene to be capable of yet more radically distinct personalities.  Although all of her characters are lovably flawed and vulnerable, she plays each of them uniquely.  I agree that she was snubbed for an Oscar with this performance.  As with her ex-boyfriend Jim Carrey, we must look to the Golden Globe awards to give due acknowledgement once again.  Finally Greg Kinnear and Allison Janney are both as excellent as one would expect. Even Crispin Glover and Betty's husband and Betty's roommate are perfect castings.
  This movie is saved from its contradictory offering to the audience of both trauma and comedy by all these terrific performances and by some really inventive and clever writing.  However, I fully understand why some people will not be able to find the charm of the performances and the writing enough to overcome the trauma of the early visuals.",991612800,,3350,4.886725663716814

The only thing standing in her way is her husband, your traditional snake of a car salesman.  However, when Betty sees him brutally murdered by a couple of hit men, she goes into a fugue state.  Oblivious to her husband's death and confused by the questions the police keep asking her, Betty decides the solution to all her problems is to head to Los Angels and be reunited with her former fiance, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).  The only problem is that the totally delusional Betty no longer knows he is just her a character from her favorite soap opera, ""A Reason to Love.""  Meanwhile the two odd couple hit-men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), try to track her down, not only because she say the murder but because there is something in the car she drove off in that they want.  Unfortunately, Charlie becomes somewhat fixated on Betty, who will be his last target before retirement.  This only infuriates his hotheaded younger partner Wesley.
Betty arrives in L.A. looking for ""Dr. Ravell"" and enjoys a couple of lucky twists of fate.  After saving the life of a young man by using a procedure she saw on television once, Betty ends up with a job in a hospital and a place to stay with Rosa, the man's sister.  Rosa even helps Betty look for David, until she discovers the truth and decides to set Betty up for a disastrous meeting with the actor who plays him at a charity function.  This encounter becomes the pivotal scene of the film providing its best moments as ""David"" is totally captivated by what he thinks is amazing improvisational method acting from Betty.  The scene is wonderfully sustained and provides the best acting moments in the film for both Zellweger and Kinnear.  Their surprising connection provides the magic that allows the story to proceed.  Of course, Betty's bubble finally bursts in a scene that is, somewhat surprisingly, brutally realistic, just as all the plot lines get drawn together for the film's climax.  We are pretty sure Betty's life is going to have a happy ending, but there are enough twists and turns here that we are not willing to predict exactly how things are going to turn out.
This DVD includes the nine brief installments of the faux soap ""A Reason to Love.""  One of the nice things about this DVD are the two director's commentary tracks, the first has LaBute with the cast, while the second features the director with the crew.  However, this disc does not have any subtitles to turn on while you listen to the commentary.  This is a movie where the performances overcome the limitations of the script.

She flees to Los Angeles with the murderers in hot pursuit because the drugs they are after are hidden in her car.  Eventually she meets up with the soap opera star of her dreams and complications follow.
The best thing I can say about this film is that Renee Zellweger looks pretty and that the story held my interest somewhat.  But instead of laughing at the supposedly funny parts, I just opened my eyes in amazement about how stupid it was.  Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are cast as the murderers and their racial stereotyping was insulting.  The rest of the cast did the best that they could but the material was just plain silly.  This film was nothing but a time waster.  But sometimes that's all we want out of a film, something mild and innocuous.  Once in a while, that's o.k.",988243200,2,952,4.494186046511628
1403613,4,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty is worth seeing for two main reasons: Renee Zellweger and Morgan Freeman.  They are simply wonderful as two romantic dreamers in search of their heart's desire.  That one is a waitress in a state of dissasociative shock and the other a hitman at the end of a long career is beside the point.  They both long for fulfillment in an idealized ""other"".
Oh, and it is a comedy.  Some graphic killing aside (I guess even semi-screwball comedy isn't immune to that in this era) it is a sweet and funny oddball comedy.
Morgan Freeman is simply incapable of a bad performance.  They could give him the Oscar every year for my money.  He is always real and always likeable which is exactly what was needed to bring this character alive.  His whistful, gradual falling in love with Betty is something to behold.
But Renee Zellweger is the revelation here.  I have tried, and I can't think of another actress that could have pulled off this role.  Her utterly believable Betty, sweetly, obstinately, determinedly marching to find her fantasy ""real love"" is daffily right and just off-center enough to make her lovably real. It is a piece of work and keeps the movie centered through some of its more farfetched plot elements.
Chris Rock and the supporting cast are fine, but it is Morgan and Renee that will hold your interest throughout.  Really fine work from them both.",987897600,,1372,4.702928870292887

Listen, I *like* Neil Labute. 'In the Company of Men' was riveting and stark. 'Your Friends & Neighbors' wasn't quite as impressive, but still well worth the time. But 'Nurse Betty.' Eh. This was a disappointment.
You know, I can remember back when I was reading about Labute's new upcoming film in some magazine (or online somewhere? -- who knows) ... and though I *wanted* to drink up the kooky premise of this new upcoming movie and say to myself: ""Original! Fresh! Genius!"" -- there was an unconvinced voice at the back of my head stubbornly insisting: ""Um ... that sounds ... stupid.""
And as I say, it was very disappointing to me to have that voice proven right when I finally got around to seeing it.
What 'Nurse Betty' does, in my eyes, is takes a fundamentally silly, unbelievable premise and attempts to build a big, and occasionally very dark, sitcom around it. Questionable in and of itself, but what's worse, is that it fails quite miserably.
Why? The main reason as I see it is that none of the characters feel the slightest bit real (Betty included), and they rarely make much sense. I enjoyed the rapport between Freeman and Rock for the first twenty minutes or so, but as the film goes on, that rapport -- instead of developing and being fleshed out -- simply becomes stilted and boring. Both characters prove themselves inexplicably weird, and neither are particularly believable as hit men, even as ""wacky"" hit men.
Since the characters do not feel real and make little sense, I felt no sympathy or empathy for/with them, and my interest level in their outcome remained fairly low. I mean sure, Betty was sweet, but her husband's murder and it's subsequent effect on her (a mysterious psychological ""snap"" which results in her believing that she's a character in her favorite soap opera), are atmospherically awkward, surprisingly unengaging, and, as I've mentioned, unbelievable.
Betty's ""sweetness"" is, I gather, supposed to be a major driving force in the movie. It is her utter lack of pretension and her faithful belief in her own fantasy which causes things to sort of ""magically"" happen around her. This bothered me. One minute, I'm watching Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock doing a shoddy Pulp Fiction imitation, the next, it's like I'm in a Disney movie. Betty ""magically"" saves the patient in the ambulance. Betty ""magically"" -- through accidental and would-be-humorous circumstances -- winds up a real nurse! Betty ""magically"" (and again through accidental, would-be-humorous circumstances) gets the chance to meet the soap star she is obsessed with, and, even MORE ""magically,"" he (again through aforementioned circumstances) falls for her, delusion and all, (albeit temporarily.)
Too much ""wonder"" and not enough fictional credibility for my tastes, on top of the already accounted for fact that none of the characters were really that interesting or developed or real-seeming.
Now, Betty's disillusionment on the set of the soap was an interesting scene (atmospherically reminiscent of Chad ""disillusioning"" Stacy Edwards' character in 'ITCOM'), and was certainly a much-needed and admirable blow to the overdone and not-especially-funny atmosphere of child-like ""magic"" ... but ultimately it doesn't do much for the film as a whole. How does it really change Betty? How does she feel about the fact that she's been clinically insane for the last ... (month or two)? Who knows? Apparently not the writer or director. Nope: Betty just snaps out of it, just as easily and unbelievably as she snapped into it, and we're quickly hurried off to what I guess was supposed to be a rollicking, nutty climax/showdown at Betty's friend's apartment, where all of the character's who've been after her simultaneously show up. Chris Rock has a few amusing moments to be sure, but on the whole it's just ... dumb. Since none of the characters are particularly coherent or entertaining, it just comes of as, well, what it is: a bunch of incoherent, not-very-entertaining characters trying really hard to save a boring, silly movie.
When all is said and done, 'Nurse Betty' did not touch me, move me, make me laugh, make me cry, engage me, disturb me, or anything else. It just made me shake my head in disappointment.
Better luck next time, Neil. You seem better off working with your own scripts.",987638400,3,4316,4.9875173370319

1403617,5,B0000584ZH,"LaBute's prior 2 films, ""In The Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" were so cynical yet real that you experienced the ultimate acidic look at relations between men and women.  I thought ""In The Company of Men"" was a stunning film but I would hardly turn it on after a hard day's work when I really needed to relax. Yes, this very same director has made a 3rd movie that I could actually like and enjoy; laugh even!  I wouldn't have believed he was capable of doing something not vitrolic.  For awhile, while watching this, I thought he'd gone all the way in the other direction and this was going to take every predictible Hollywood turn. He didn't go that route, Thank God. He pairs Zellwegger with the most unpleasant husband imaginable (the lead from ""In The Company of Men"") and then has hubby disposed of by two hit men.

Zellwegger's character, Betty, experiences post traumatic stress syndrome since she witnessed the murder.  She becomes, in her own mind, a character, Nurse Betty, on her favorite soap opera, ""Reason To Love.""  She is so deeply into this fantasy that she takes off for LA to find her ""former fiance"", the ""doctor"" from the show.  The 2 hit men, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, have to find her to get their money back, which is hidden in her car. How far does she follow her fantasy?  Well, the imagination knows no limits here but I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone.  Suffice it to say that you will have a rollicking good time yet the film does not descend to Hollywood's dream machine level.  In short, it does not become moronic along the way.  If I had one quibble with the movie it is in using the cliche of 2 hit men to move the plot along.  However, the husband had to be disposed of in shocking fashion so I suppose that took the possibilities down to only a few.  Freeman and Rock do a really good job with these 2 roles, which in most other hands would have been awful.

Zellweiger is perfectly delightful as Nurse Betty, a woman in a difficult marriage, secretly smitten with a doctor (played by Greg Kinnear) in her favorite soap opera. When Betty gets hit on the head, she loses her memory and believes she is REALLY living in the soap opera world she loves. While Zellweiger is great, the film needs the performances of the other actors to really carry the whole premise off - and, happily, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear and the rest of the cast are rock-solid in their roles.

1403630,4,B0000584ZH,"'Nurse Betty' struck me as being willfully pretentious at first, but a few days later I came to realize what a gem this movie is. I certainly would not rate it one of the best films of last year, but I do realize how different and novel the movie is.
Renee Zellweger in particular has fascinated me with her choice in roles. No doubt, 'Bridget Jones' Diary' will propel her into superstardom, but its roles like this and her simple turn in 'Jerry Maguire' that make this actress more refreshing than Julia Roberts on a good day. That said, 'Nurse Betty' demands much from its' lead actress and a solid screenplay, and fortunately, it scores high in both departments.
Sadly, every film has its' weaknesses, and this one is no different. Some of the acting is sloppy, especially Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's scenes together. And while Renee steers the movie along at a nice pace, there are moments when you can't help yawning and hoping that something drastic happens soon. And it does. This is a movie with a load of surprises, and though it manages to be heavily cliche-driven, despite the novel subject matter, it does shine when it matters.
I got this on DVD the other day and was struck by the brilliant picture transfer, and the wonderful inclusion of 10 mini-episodes of 'A Reason to Love', the fictional soap that Nurse Betty lives to watch. Greg Kinnear is great as a self-obsessed actor (though he does over-play his tantrum scene in the end) and Chris Rock as a fanatical mobman is excellent, if a little scary.
But in the end, the film is Renee's. Don't be put off by the cheesy DVD cover art - I looked past that, and found myself enjoying a smart, witty comedy, with shades of dark to counter the cheer, at every turn. Brilliant work, even if a little choppy.",986688000,4,1774,4.564263322884012

1403633,5,B0000584ZH,"After witnessing her husband's murder by two hit men, sweet-natured Betty has a nervous breakdown, becoming convinced that she is a character from her favorite soap opera and sets off to L.A. to meet her long lost love, a doctor on the show. Unfortunately, the car she's driving is loaded with drugs and the hit men are slowly, but surely, tracking her down. This is far from director Neil LaBute's searing social dramas ('In The Company Of Men' and 'Your Friends And Neighbors') but he handles the wacky source material well. In fact 'Nurse Betty' might very well be the single most surprising film of the past year, featuring more unexpected plot twists and absurd revelations then the soap opera it's characters watch religiously. It is in turns fascinating, hilarious, and disturbing. Renee Zellweger is amazing once again, balancing her performance with equal parts tenderness and goofiness. It's clear to see why she was a Golden Globe winner. The film is, in nature, a comedy sparked with players who are all too serious in their performances but quite unexpectedly throw out one-liners in such rapid succession that they always seem THIS CLOSE to being cartoons. This is a story where everything is as false as a television soap opera. The sly leading man (Greg Kinnear) is a total jerk; the stern, older hit man (a great Morgan Freeman) claims to be rooted in instinct yet clearly falls for his prey; the younger apprentice hit man (an out-of-genre yet surprisingly effective Chris Rock) would be terrifying if it weren't for the fact he's so damn laughable. But the film does have it's darker moments. The murder of Betty's husband that sets the film in motion is gruesome and graphic. We are made PAINFULLY aware that Freeman and Rock are killers as they scalp and then shoot poor Aaron Eckhart, and the act reverberates through-out the entire film. The sheer thought of sweet, lovely Betty meeting the same fate as her cheating thief of a husband looms over the action like storm clouds. The final shoot-out of the film centers around a shocking revelation that makes the outcome of the scene all the more devastating. And the final gunshot heard in the film is so startling, happening in the exact moment one character realizes her life has just begun another character's life comes to an end. This film is as light-hearted a comedy as you will find on the rental shelves but it does not lie to the audience about the reprocussions of it's character's actions. It's hard to say whether or not the film has a happy ending, but i will say it ties it up nicely, not sugar-coating the audience, and not letting them off the hook too easily either. It's a terrific film, balenced evenly on comedy and devastation and definitly deserves an audience which, unfortunately, it never found at the theaters. The DVD edition is superb, featuring two commentary tracks and a collection of 'A Reason To Love' episodes (which is the original soap opera created for the movie). The handful of deleted scenes are nice but be forewarned: one of the scenes (entitled 'The Flap') contains an EXTREME scene of violence, easily the most disgusting fatal head wound ever filmed. Seen out of context it is simply shocking and easily one extra I wished I would have just skipped over. But to deny the film would be to deny yourself 110 minutes of pure originality. Neil LaBute scores yet another touchdown.",986342400,3,3394,4.813356164383562

1403635,4,B0000584ZH,"A complete departure for director Neil LaBute, his third film and first ""major"" vehicle, it is an amazing piece which actually turns in the total opposite direction of his first films which were not hopeful or friendly to the more human and sympathetic aspects of people. Don't get me wrong... there are still ugly, criminal, and cruel people populating this film, but this time there is a balance... and the balance is struck beautifully. Rene Zellweger is her charming self, playing the plucky soap opera addicted Kansas waitress, Betty, who is married to a corrupt car salesman played brilliantly by Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart has shady business deals going (as well as adulterous affairs). Two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, who are both excellent) come to town to kill him and do so most gruesomely. However, they do not realise that Betty is home and witnesses the murder. (They have previously met Betty, though, because she was their waitress at the diner). Betty is watching a videotape of her favourite soap and its heartthrob doctor (played well by Greg Kinnear) when the murder takes place. As some sort of psychological defence mechanism Betty assumes a new personality and believes that she is a nurse and the fiance of Kinnear's character. She assumes a false life as her own, gets in the car and drives to California to reclaim that life. Things go along swimmingly at first, and the people who meet her do not realise how seriously she takes this assumed life. Most think she is joking, others think she is an overly ambitious actress trying to work her way into the soap opera. She meets the writers and stars of the soap opera, and it is only when she is told that she is going to have a walk on bit part on the soap that she ""snaps out"" of this psychological trauma. The pivotal and almost frightening part of this film is when she is on the set of the show and suddenly comes to the realisation that she does not know where she is or how she got there. Meanwhile Freeman and Rock have been chasing Betty across the country because they have to kill her since she was a witness to the murder of her husband. As they travel Freeman falls in love with this image he has of Betty, and Rock has to convince him to get a hold of himself. The film does not end completely happily, but Betty does come out happily in the end. Zellweger shines in this film, and it is well worth seeing.",985564800,15,2403,4.539170506912442
1403636,4,B0000584ZH,"I recommend this movie simply because it was so different from what Hollywood usually gives us.  I found this movie mesmerizing.  We wanted to cook dinner and watch the movie at the same time, but the story was so compelling that dinner had to wait.  I watched this movie with a group of people and all of us were glued to the screen to see what happened next.  We all wondered what kept us watching, but whatever it was, we could not miss a word.
Rene Zellweger portrays a lonely young woman who views the world and all of its harsh realities with ""rose colored glasses"".  When she witnesses the ghastly & frightening murder of her husband she separates herself from reality and focuses on the only thing in her life that brings her any comfort and that is her television soap opera.  Betty believes that she must go to California and find her Doctor.  I thought that this was completely in line with her character.  Betty has put a positive spin on her entire life up to this point and in the midst of tragedy, the only positives she can find are in an alternate reality, that she creates for herself.  She meets several interesting characters in her quest for her fantasy, and they all believe that she is crazy.  The entire cast here did an excellent job.  Morgan Freeman was outstanding.
My biggest criticism of the movie was the language.  It did not need ALL of the expletives that were used.  I can understand some harsh language tossed in now and again to make a point, but when most of the characters can't seem to articulate a sentence without extreme profanity, I have to wonder where they were educated. Also, I would never consider ""Nurse Betty"" a comedy.  There were some funny parts to this film, but if it is a comedy it is one of the darkest that I have ever seen.",984614400,,1782,4.443076923076923
1403637,5,B0000584ZH,"It isn't often that we see a fresh comedy.  ""Nurse Betty"" is certainly that and much more.  If this is any indication of the kind of material that we can expect from first time screenwriter John Richards, then he has a very bright future ahead of him.  It is the story of a waitress who always wanted to be a nurse.  She lives this dream vicariously by immersing herself in her favorite soap opera.  When she is emotionally traumatized by witnessing the murder of her husband, she retreats into a world where fantasy and reality are fused.  She believes that the soap opera is reality and that she is part of that reality.  So she sets out to find the lead character in the show, a doctor whom she believes was once her fianc.
Naturally, this gives rise to numerous hilarious situations as she goes about living as a soap opera character in the real world.  What is so clever about the way the story is written is that Betty is extremely believable while engaging in absurd behavior.  In most comedies, we justify the comical behavior of characters by assuming the characters or the situations are ludicrous.  In this story, the character and the situations are very realistic, but her temporary insanity puts her in a separate realm where she can be simultaneously earnest and amusing.
The addition of the killers attempting to track her down adds an additional comic element, delivering a more traditional type of humor, with absurd characters doing absurd things while acting as if they believe they are serious.  This terrific and innovative blend makes the film sparkle with novel situations.
The direction by Neil Labute is excellent.  It is a challenge to keep a script like this from collapsing into farce, but Labute brought forth genuine performances from all the actors that maintained the believability in the premise.  He also created some nice effects with lighting in various scenes.  Considering that this is Labute's first major motion picture, he did an extraordinary job.  As a piece of developing trivia, this is the third film directed by Labute, all of which have college chum Aaron Eckhart in the cast.  His next film, called ""Possession"", stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeremy Northam, and surprise, Aaron Eckhart.
As good as the story is, it would not have worked without Renee Zellweger.  Zellweger oozes sincerity with a lovable naivet that makes Betty utterly believable.  Since I first saw her in ""Jerry MaGuire"", I continue to be more impressed with each new role.  She has an ethereal quality about her that makes her dreamy and adorable, while still having the depth as an actor to handle the heavy scenes with an emotional force one wouldn't expect from such an airy actor.  I also enjoyed the performances of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  They make a wonderful odd couple, the introspective career killer and the brash hothead.  Allison Janney also gives a fantastic performance in a supporting role as the soap opera producer.
This is a unique and delightful comedy despite that fact that it is a bit dark and bizarre.  I rated it a 9/10.  Sometimes dreams really do come true.",983923200,2,3106,4.8279773156899815

This fantasy has some great moments, most of them being between Rock and Freeman. In a mild Pulp Fiction ripoff, Freeman is another in a seemingly endless parade of philosophical hitmen, yet Freeman's hitman is so good and amusing that you forgive the farmiliarity. Rock shines as always and portrays a more amoral and violent man.
The soap opera aspects are interesting, as we see how people use them to escape from staid, difficult existences.
A scalping, a dash of romance, aspirations of nursing, and a nice depiction of ordinary folk combine to make this a dynamic film that manipulates endlessly, but you will forgive.",983836800,,756,4.960629921259843
1403650,4,B0000584ZH,"I think what prevents ""Nurse Betty"" from becoming a really great movie is that it tries to be too many things at once.  It is part soap opera parody, woman on the run flick, buddy movie, satire of small town America, and deconstruction of the line between fantasy and reality.  On their own, all of these elements work wonderfully.  But when combined together in a jumbled stew, the pot tends to overflow.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie.  I did.  Immensely.
Topping the list of enjoyable elements is the fine cast.  Morgan Freeman exudes wisdom and cool in one scene, and off-his-rocker mania in another.  He is so effortless here, you won't be able to spot him acting.  Most of his scenes are with Chris Rock, who, while not up to Freeman's lofty standards, acquits himself quite well in his portrayal of a surprisingly complex character.  These two share an easy chemistry, and provide some of the movie's funnier moments.  Greg Kinnear is cast perfectly as a handsome but bland soap opera star.  He doesn't really do much other than flash his perfect teeth and show off the sparkle in his eyes, but then again he doesn't really have to.  His character is little more than a device.  In smaller roles, Aaron Eckhart (a LaBute staple), Crispin Glover, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and the great Allison Janney do yeomen's work livening up the background.  And Renee Zellweger shines in the title role.  I am not usually a fan of her work (her schtick strikes me as nothing more than Joey Lauren Adams-lite), but here she is appealing as the woman on the run from both hired killers and her own senses.  Loaded up with attractive innocence, you can't help fall and feel sorry for Zellweger's Betty.
Neil LaBute, the writer/director behind the scornful double-bill ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors"", only wears his director's hat here.  Which I thought would have been too bad, because it was his writing that pushed those two flicks over the top.  He seems to have poured his writer's energy into directing, for there are some moments when he tries too hard to make an impression (i.e., using extreme blues or browns in certain scenes, calls too much attention to his style when it's not really needed).  Overall, though, he did a fine job, moving the story along, and getting some great work from his actors.  He leaves the script in the hands of John C. Richards and James Flamberg, both first time screenwriters, who do an admirable job with it.  Although their collective minds begin to wander at times (the scenes of Betty in the company of her soap opera fantasy man could have been shortened a tad), when they get their focus, it is strong and funny.  In the end, I didn't miss the vitriol of LaBute's earlier films (although I am itching for him to return to those days again).
Although not really able to spark the kinds of dialogue that his previous films did, ""Nurse Betty"" is ultimately a rewarding experience from LaBute.  It never stands up to make any bold statements, preferring to take the gentler road.  And I guess that's the real strength: in showing that LaBute is more than a one-note auteur, ""Betty"" is a promise of a varied and interesting filmmaking career to come.",983577600,,3223,4.671985815602837

They rose to the occasion and blew it out for us.  And then think abut how nothing is as it seems. For that is the point of this charming, yet sometimes quite graphically violent movie. This movie is unique. The people are not who they are, the story is not what you think, and you're in for the ride of your life. By the time you're halfway there, chasing amiable, if driven, amnesiac Betty accross the country, it seems that picturing her in Dorothy from Kansas' gingham dress while standing in a dimly lit Grand Canyon with hitman Morgan Freeman looking adoringly at her is going to make plenty of sense. And why not indeed.
Now see this movie. It is a remarkable morality play with incredible charm, class, and demented fun and what you read into it, yourself, in every aspect.",983059200,4,1611,4.494880546075085
1403653,5,B0000584ZH,"This movie is a wonderful low-key comedy starring Renee Zellwegger in her brilliant performance as Betty, who believes she's a nurse on a popular soap opera after going in shock from witnessing her husband's horrific murder. The two hitmen who killed her husband are the suprizingly hilarious duo, Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman. The plot twists and turns as we follow Betty from her rural mid-west hometown to Hollywood because she believes that she is a nurse who is in love with an arrogant doctor, played fittingly by Greg Kinnear. Morgan Freeman steals the laughs from Chris Rock as they follow Betty, who's the only witness to the murder, across the country and always one step behind her.  Everyone will enjoy this movie for it's talented actors, it's comedy and it's ""warm and fuzzy"" ending.",980553600,15,798,4.911111111111111
1403654,5,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty was highly overlooked when it made its theatrical run. The critics were mostly in high praise of it, but the average movie going audience opted to go see something else. And why was this? Because people do not have any idea what is good and what is bad.
This film was a terrific look at the lengths someone could go to seek out their idealized life. Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job as Betty, a waitress whose husband treats her terrible so she loses herself into the soap opera world. She is completely in love with Greg Kinear, who also does a great job as the phony doctor and the actor who is a true jerk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock get thrown into the mix as 2 assasins that kill Betty's husband, causing Betty to flee. Freeman and Rock follow her to Hollywood where she can live out her fantasies and become some one new.
This film is something different from what we are all used to seeing. It is thoughtful and incredibly entertaining. The comparisons to Fargo are entirely wrong. This film is nothing like Fargo. This film has a much different tone and a much different atmosphere. Overall a great film.",979603200,11,1131,4.495145631067961
1403655,2,B0000584ZH,"There are rip offs and then there are rip offs. And when you steal from the masters, it's usually a very visible theft. Nurse Betty, while not falling for the more conventional traps completely, does make it's roots very evident.
Rene Zellweger plays the title role, a mousy Kansas waitress married to a scumbag car salesman who, unbeknownst to her, is dealing drugs as a sideline. When she inadvertently witnesses his brutal murder, it causes a psychotic split that convinces her that she's actually the old flame of her favorite soap opera character Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). She leaves the scene of the crime in a haze to go find him and it's not long before the murderers are hot on her trail.
Now you have to give the plot credit for originality but there are just so many problems in the execution that originality alone is not enough to save it. In that respect it reminds me of last year's Being John Malkovich (although not as original as that - what is?). The film is basically split into two threads - Betty finding her fictional lover and the killers who are after her. That second thread reveals problems early on.
Morgan Freeman plays the seasoned hit man showing the new kid, Chris Rock, the ropes. Their story opens with the sort of banter that Tarantino is known for and evolves into a direct lift from the Coen Brothers bickering bad guys a la Fargo. Freeman plays it with some panache as a smooth old timer looking to retire and finding that he's falling for his target but Rock, in a very uncharacteristic turn, is nothing but screaming anger and complaining throughout the film. I don't know how general audiences will take his latest character, but to this viewer he became a grating harpy real fast. I just don't like seeing a decent comedic actor scalping his victims and roaring with rage in every single scene. There's got to be a human being in there somewhere.
The whole story of Betty however is the real point of originality here. I wish writers James Flamberg and John C. Richards had stuck to this and allowed the character to develop more fully. Her soap opera obsession is shared by most of the people she meets along her journey and there's certainly some good parody to be had on the small screen. Zellweger turns out possibly the best performance of her career in such a sweet, low key way that you just can't help but root for her and after traveling across the country, the scene where she finally meets the object of her affection makes the whole film worthwhile.
Unfortunately that's the high point in a movie that borrows too liberally from the aforementioned bastions of '90s film. If someone like Tarantino, the Coen brothers or maybe even the Farrellys (There's Something About Mary) had this production, they could keep it interesting and manage to tie the whole thing together. As it is, Nurse Betty is as schizophrenically split as it's title character. Combining violence and comedy is a tricky thing to handle and if you don't do it well, it's too easy to fall into the cracks of those who do.",976492800,,3050,4.639556377079482
1403656,2,B0000584ZH,"I don't know if this is meant to be a comedy, a love story, or maybe yet another of those pseudo-moralizing movies. No matter what it is, it just doesn't work. Nurse Betty is stuffed with clichs and there is far between the good laughs.
The only plus is Rene Zellweger's not just good but amazing acting. She's so natural, so human. One of today's few great actresses!",975283200,,368,4.426470588235294
1403657,2,B0000584ZH,"Nurse Betty isn't a terrible movie, but it's not all that great either.  It takes a pretty funny concept, serves up a wonderful cast and continues to do nothing with it.  Director Neil LaBute walks the line between comedy and drama in this film, but it all becomes a tedious bore. Renee Zellweger shines as Betty, an unhappily married waitress who religiously watches a soap opera and has a crush on the show's number 1 star (Greg Kinnear).  What Betty doesn't know is that her slimeball husband (Aaron Eckhart-who was excellent in LaBute's In the Company of Men) is mixed up in some sort of a drug deal and one night, is visited by two hitmen played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.  When Betty's husband is brutally murdered by Rock, she witnesses the killing and goes into a state of shock. Her mind takes her into her soap opera where she becomes 'nurse Betty' and sets out for California to find Kinner (who of course, plays a doctor on her favorite show).Nurse Betty is a movie that seems like it's going to get really, really good any second, but as Betty begins her trek to California-she doesn't know about the drug stash in her trunk-she is pursued by Freeman and Rock.  This is about as far as this film goes.  At first it's funny to see Betty interact with the outside world as she believes she's on a soap opera, but the movie basically coasts on this one joke until the final twenty minutes.  It becomes tiring and quite dull.  There's an amusing sequence where she meets up with Kinnear's character and speaks to him using only lines from the show.  At the same time, Freeman and Rock are on her trail, Morgan Freeman is great in just about anything he does, the dialogue between he and Rock is a little explicit, but often hilarious.  He turns in a great performance as his character grows more and more obsessed with Betty.  Chris Rock really surpises here also, he is quite funny in this film, but his role, as a psychotic hitman borders on chilling.  When the film finally arrives at its predictable climax, there aren't many surprises and one can't help but be glad to see this one finished.  At nearly two hours, it's needlessly long and repetitive.  Nurse Betty may not have much going for it in terms of story, but if you're a fan of any of the actors in this film, I would suggest renting it.  All of the actors in this film shine.  There's even a great small role by Crispin Glover (George McFly in Back to the Future) who is hilarious.  The film itself meshes grisily violence (the murder sequence is a bit disturbing) with light comedy and comes up empty.  I can't say this is a terrible film, but not very good either.  Nurse Betty is a film that can slide by based solely on the strength of its actors, it's no success, but more of an interesting flop.",972518400,,2782,4.462450592885376
1403658,3,B0000584ZH,"If you liked Fargo, Magnolia, and perhaps Jackie Brown, you're going to also enjoy ""Nurse Betty"" as a film continuing the present trend in creative storylines.  Neil LaBute can join the Coen brothers as a director who mastered the combination of humor noir, infatuation, pain and a bit of gore with a satirical look at soap operas and all of us that find escape through them. You could say this is a Fargo-styled ""date flick""... almost.
Renee Zellweger's basically plays the same really sweet-girl-looks-for-Price-Charming role you'll remember from ""Jerry McGuire"". In this film she attempts to deal with a bizarre and tragic series of events spawned initially from her marriage to a loser car salesman (Aaron Eckhart).  Betty's favorite hospital soap opera offers the singular daily escape from her own marriage and dead-end life.  All that hyper-jumps to the surreal when she witnesses a gruesome murder. The result is a wild ride as Betty departs town... and reality, as her sole means to cope through living out the soap.
Greg Kinnear plays the target of Betty's obsession as a seemingly sensitive but actually self-absorbed love interest, much as he did in ""Sabrina"". Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are an unlikely father-and-son hit team after Betty.  Freeman does a great job mirroring Betty's fantasy with his own obsession of her, making for an interesting twist and ending to Betty's experience.
The result is an entertaining ensemble film touching home with our own occasional forays into fantasy.
I would have given this film four stars except for writer's and director's inability (or Chris Rock's unwillingness) to develop humor apart from voluminous profanities.  The only redeeming factor in it was the contrast it built between ""class"" and ""crass"" when Freeman and Rock stood side by side.  Nurse Betty stands on it's own without it.",970358400,5,1849,5.1262458471760795
1403659,5,B0000584ZH,"A young waitress in a small town in Kansas witnesses an act of violence so unspeakable that her mind refuses to accept it; instead, like a ray of light reflected through a prism, she takes a detour within herself and enters a reality in which things are just a little bit better and nicer, one that fuses with the world of her favorite soap opera wherein resides the ""doctor"" of her dreams.  Renee Zellweger stars in ""Nurse Betty,"" a satirical comedy/drama with some serious psychological overtones from director Neil LaBute.  It's an objective look at, among other things, small town life, the aesthetics of professional hit men, an unhealthy (?) obsession with soap operas, and the ethics of car salesmen.  One thing is certain:  After the aforementioned incident, Dorothy isn't in Kansas anymore.  And her story becomes an odyssey of sorts, one that is both exhilarating and hilarious, and by turn somber and disturbing.  Since those with whom Betty comes into contact do not realize that she is dwelling within a reality of her own design, it creates moments of absolute side-splitting hilarity as they try to figure out what is going on with her; is she putting them on, or is she in fact, deranged?  But at the same time, even as you're laughing, there is an element of discomfort about it, because you know the truth of it all, and what a sad and serious situation it really is.  You feel, not only for Betty, but for all of those involved with her as well, and it's like manic depression; you ride the wild highs, but come down just as hard.  As Betty, Renee Zellweger gives what just may be the best performance of her career; there is such a gentleness of nature about her, a winsomeness and pacificism that makes her such a wonderfully sympathetic character.  Early in the film LaBute establishes what kind of a person Betty is; she's easy to like and someone you care about instantly, someone you want to see good things happen to.  And it makes the impact of the violence with which she is visited all the more profound (and be advised, the scene is shockingly reminiscent of the torture scene in ""Reservoir Dogs;"" somewhat graphic, but because of excellent directing and editing, you get the illusion of seeing more than you actually are.  It is definitely one that you will not soon forget).  These are things that should not happen to someone like Betty; it just doesn't seem fair somehow, and the connection that she makes with the audience underscores what a brilliant job Zellweger has done.  Equal credit, of course, has to go to Neil LaBute, for creating the perfect atmosphere through which the desired results are so impeccably delivered.  The serene, almost lilting essence of Betty's reality, this kind of ""Pleasantville"" into which she has entered, contrasts so vividly with the thread of violence and menace laced throughout that it heightens the emotional response to it all.  He has successfully managed the perfect balancing of the pure with the despicable and enhanced it all with pace, timing and some memorable performances.  Besides Zellweger, Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Charlie, the aging hit-man out to finish one last job before retiring.  He brings a commanding demeanor to the role, coupled with a maturity and intelligence that adds so much to the depth of the character.  And Greg Kinnear, as Dr. David Ravell/George McCord, gives a definitive performance as the soap opera star of Betty's dreams.  It is a character Kinnear was born to play and he covers all the bases, leaving no doubt as to just exactly who and what this guy is all about.  Notable performances also are turned in by Chris Rock, as Wesley, Charlie's protege; and by Aaron Eckhart, as Del, Betty's sleazy, neglectful car salesman husband.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Tia Texada (Rosa), Crispin Glover (Roy), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Ballard), Allison Janney (Lyla) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Sue Ann).  Rarely are there so many truly memorable performances in a single movie, and again, LaBute must be given credit for bringing out the best in his actors; it adds a polish to the finished product that is inestimable.  Another reason for the success of this film is that the humor is natural and true; rather than being forced or contrived it issues from real situations and the characters reactions to them, and LaBute plays everything straight, which makes it all real.  The laughs (and there are many) are born of their own merit; each one is honest and earned.  And again, because of that purity of delivery, it makes the drama all the more effective.  Well made and delivered, ""Nurse Betty"" is highly entertaining and certainly memorable; a funny, emotional movie that will have you alternately gasping and cheering.  Check this one out; it's a motion picture experience you do not want to miss.",969840000,22,4818,4.8498168498168495
