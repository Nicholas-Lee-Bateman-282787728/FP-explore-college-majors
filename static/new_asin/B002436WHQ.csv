3842997,3,B002436WHQ,"Fatal Four-Way United States Championship Match: Kofi Kingston (Champion) vs. Matt Hardy vs. MVP vs. William Regal
I love this match because it gives William Regal, a superstar we haven't seen much from for a long time, a chance to prove himself. While he does botch a few moves, everyone in the match does a great job, and MVP as a good guy works great. The match started off with Regal betraying Matt Hardy and pushing him into Kofi and MVP, but then Hardy did the same to Regal later in the bout. Kofi was particularly impressive with some unique counters, even taking a couple pages out of Christian's book a few times, as well as his array of kicks. He scoop slammed Regal on top of Matt and hit one of his finishing moves, a double leg drop, that he calls Stereo. MVP also hit an elbow drop that received a huge pop and the crowd chanted along to ""Ball'n!"" Regal messed up what was supposed to be a combination of moves. Regal was supposed to hit a super tigerplex on Kofi while MVP simultaneously German suplexed Regal, but MVP lost his footing and Regal went along with the move anyway. At another point, Regal yanked Kofi out of the corner and Kofi landed pretty funky, and Regal also botched a knee to the face towards the end of the match. The end came when Kofi hit the Trouble in Paradise (a move where he kicks the opponent in the back of the head) to get the victory and retain his title. I wish this match was longer. Winner: Kofi Kingston. Match Rating: 4/5

No Holds Barred Intercontinental Championship Match: Rey Mysterio (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho
YES! The rivalry between Chris Jericho and Rey Mysterio continues! At the beginning, Mysterio beat the crap out of Jericho for quite a while, smacking him in the head with the cover to the announce table and doing some general brawling. Mysterio countered Jericho's attempt to toss him into the steel steps by FLIPPING over the steps, using his hands to propel him! DAMN! Mysterio also hit a unique 619 while Jericho was resting against the ring post, and Mysterio hit the Seated Senton off the top turnbuckle, only to get a two count. Jericho tried to pull off Mysterio's mask a couple of times, but Mysterio battled out of the attempts. Mysterio tried to hit the 619 again, but Jericho countered into the Walls of Jericho! Mysterio managed to twist out of it and hit a 619 to the back of Jericho's head! Jericho countered the Swan Dive by Mysterio with a Codebreaker that came out of NOWHERE, but THAT ONLY GOT TWO! Frustrated, Jericho went to the outside to get a steel chair, but when he brought it into the ring, Mysterio dropkicked it right into Jericho's face! Mysterio followed this up with the Swan Dive, only to get TWO!!! Holy crap this is a great match!!! Mysterio then hit a Sabu-style double leg drop on Jericho with the steel chair but still only got two! Jericho eventually locked on the Walls of Jericho right in the middle of the ring, but Mysterio grabbed the steel chair from earlier and managed to twist Jericho over and smash the steel chair on Jericho's head! This caused Jericho to land right on the second rope, but when Mysterio went for the 619, JERICHO YANKED OFF HIS MASK!!! This gave Jericho the opportunity to pin Mysterio and become the first ever nine-time Intercontinental Champion! Winner: Chris Jericho. Match Rating: 5/5

Samoan Strap Match: CM Punk vs. Umaga
Gah! Another ""blah"" performance by CM Punk who has been average at best for the last three pay-per-views. Umaga tried to make the match work by using the strap to whip Punk around, but in all honesty, neither individual really had much of a chance to make this interesting. I've only seen one match like this that I really liked and that was Kane vs. Triple H at Judgment Day 2001. The match was rather uneventful and boring, with the only cool thing happening being CM Punk being able to hit the Go To Sleep on Umaga after he failed to do so at the last pay-per-view. The rules of this match, by the way, are to touch the four top turnbuckles in succession in order to win. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 2/5

Special Stipulations Triple Threat Hardcore ECW Championship Match: Christian (Champion) vs. Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer
The special stipulation for this match is that if Tommy Dreamer loses, he will have to leave the WWE forever. The match wasn't as ""hardcore"" as you would expect, but it's still very innovative, entertaining, and the ending is awesome as hell. The only weapons used is a Singapore cane, trashcans, trashcan lids, and a crutch. Dreamer was very impressive, hitting a side-Russian leg sweep on Jack Swagger with the cane on his throat and also hitting a pumphandle slam on Christian with the cane right on his genitals! Swagger took a lot of shots to the gut with the cane and plenty of shots to the head with the trashcan lid, so I was pretty impressed with his willingness to get hardcore. At one point, Swagger and Christian were both on the outside. Dreamer grabbed a trashcan, held it on his shoulders, ran off the apron, and did a flip onto Christian and Swagger! Christian tried to do his usual run at the corner and propel off the top turnbuckle to the outside clothesline move, but Dreamer countered by throwing a trashcan into his face! Dreamer set Swagger up in the corner and placed a trashcan in front of his head, but Christian pulled Dreamer to the outside before he could do anything, and then Christian ran forward and dropkicked the trashcan right into Swagger's face!!! Swagger got the advantage again though and set up three trashcans right next to each other in the middle of the ring, and they were all ones that had been used so they were jagged and bent up. Swagger then set Dreamer up on the top turnbuckle to superplex him into the trashcans, but then Christian POWERBOMBED Swagger, causing Dreamer to ultimatley hit the jagged trashcans with much more force!!! Christian and Swagger had great chemistry once again, with Christian countering the gutwrench powerbomb in a Killswitch attempt, only to have Swagger counter it into another gutwrench powerbomb attempt! Dreamer broke up the move by smacking Swagger in the ribs with the crutch, knocking Christian down, and then BREAKING THE CRUTCH ON SWAGGER'S BACK!!! Dreamer then hit the Dreamer DDT...AND WON THE MATCH!!! I forgot to mention that at one point, Swagger took another nasty bump when Dreamer smacked his fingers against the turnbuckle using the cane. Overall, all three performers gave it their all and I was very impressed, and it's nice to see Tommy Dreamer actually win once in a while. Winner: Tommy Dreamer. Match Rating: 5/5

Handicap Hog Pen Miss WrestleMania Crown Match: Vickie Guerrero (Miss WrestleMania) and Chavo Guerrero vs. Santina Marella
Vickie Guerrero won the Miss WrestleMania crown from ""Santina"" thanks to William Regal, so now Santina looks to reclaim her rightful throne. Well, at the last second, Vickie, the General Manager of Raw, changed the match into a handicap match and made Chavo get into the hog pen! Basically, they wrestled in a pen with some hogs, buckets of slop, mud, and feces everywhere. Santina threw some mud at Chavo to start things off and then it was a lame brawl. Chavo went for a piledriver, but Santina countered it with a back body drop. Santina also dumped Chavo into the hogs, but Chavo started to gain the advantage, and Vickie tagged herself in. Santina got the advantage quickly and was prepared to throw a bucket of slop onto Vickie, but Chavo ran back in and knocked Santina down. He then tried to throw slop on Santina, but Santina moved out of the way, and the slop went all over Vickie!!! Santina then dumped a bucket of slop onto Chavo's head, punched the bucket while it was still on his head, and then threw Vickie to the ground to pin her and get the victory! While it was stupid, it was still kind of entertaining. Winner: Santina Marella. Match Rating: 3/5

Steel Cage WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Batista
This match was way too short, but at the same time, the short length helped it. Orton tried to escape from the cage quickly right when the match started and nearly made it out, but Batista threw him back down into the ring. Orton got beat up on for the large portion of the beginning of the match, being thrown face-first into the steel cage multiple times, but Orton finally started to gain the advantage and Batista took some shots into the cage himself. Batista nailed a Spinebuster out of nowhere, but when he went for the Batista Bomb, Orton countered with a back body drop that sent Batista into the steel cage! Orton then dropkicked Batista right in the face as he stood up, bouncing the back of his head off the steel! Orton was about to escape, but then decided to go for his concussion punt to put Batista on the injured list once again. Batista countered the punt, and Orton quickly tried to escape again, but Batista went for another Batista Bomb as he dragged Orton off the cage. Orton desperately tried to grab the cage to escape from Batista, but a few right hands enabled him to hop off. Orton went for the RKO, but Batista pushed him face-first into the steel, and then hit the Batista Bomb as he bounced back. It was better than their match at Judgment Day, but both of these men can do better. Winner: Batista. Match Rating: 4/5

Submission Match: John Cena vs. The Big Show
I was surprised with this match. John Cena and Big Show's match at Judgment was awful, and I thought this match, a submission match of all things, would be even worse. The match ended up being okay, nothing special, but it was a step up from their previous match. Big Show beat up on Cena for most of the match, and it felt like Judgment Day all over, with all of John Cena's counters and attempts at offense being easily thwarted by Show. However, Cena locked on a nice sleeper hold on Big Show that lasted quite a while, but he couldn't get the STF (apparently it is no longer called the STFU for some stupid reason) locked on. Cena did manage to nail an FU and his usual arsenal of moves on Big Show, but Big Show nailed a Chokeslam. Big Show's second attempt at a Chokeslam was countered, and then the fight spilled to the outside. At first, Big Show had the advantage, throwing Cena rib-first into the steel ring post, but Cena managed to counter a charge by Big Show and send him face-first into the post! Cena followed up on this by climbing to the top turnbuckle as Show crawled back into the ring, nailing his usual leg drop, and then came the ending. The ending was very unique as Cena used the ring ropes to hold Show's leg while he did the upper body portion of the STF!!! Big Show tapped out. Better than I expected, but nothing to get excited over. Winner: John Cena. Match Rating: 3/5

Ladder World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy
Match of the night, without a doubt. The usual ladder spots were used, like a baseball slide by Edge that sent a ladder smacking right into Jeff, as well as the men incorporating the ladders into their usual moves. Jeff Hardy hit his swinging mule kick in the corner with the ladder pressed against Edge's head, for example. At one point, Edge set the ladder up in one corner and threw Jeff into the corner so hard that the ladder bounced off the turnbuckles! Edge then set the ladder up on the other corner, threw Jeff into it, and then ran full speed at Jeff for the Spear, but Jeff jumped over Edge and Edge smacked his face on one of the ladder rungs! One neat spot was when Jeff got out the 20-foot ladder, prepared to hit the Swanton Bomb on Edge off of it, but Edge rolled out of the way. As a result, Jeff just tipped the ladder over and grabbed the belt on the way down! Jeff was unable to unhook the belt however, and Edge yanked him down to have him smack his face right on top of the ladder that fell! Another cool spot was when Jeff set the ladder upside down, and then performed a faceplant suplex on Edge through it that not only broke the ladder but looked like it nearly cut Edge in half! The fight spilled to the outside and some steel steps spots were used as well as more ladder shots. Jeff missed the Poetry in Motion on Edge and fell into the crowd and smacked his body right onto the concrete! Both men hit their signature moves, like Edge hit the Spear and Jeff hit the Twist of Fate, but any attempts to grab the World Heavyweight Championship suspended above the ring were thwarted. Edge set a ladder up bridge-styled on the security barricade and the ring apron, harkening back to the Money in the Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania 23. A suplex attempt on top of the ladder by Edge was countered, and then Jeff got another 20-foot ladder ready after setting Edge up on the ladder bridge! Jeff was prepared to Swanton Bomb Edge through the ladder, but Edge got up and ran up the other side of the ladder to battle Hardy. The men tilted the ladder and...THEY BOTH WENT THROUGH THE LADDER BRIDGE!!! The action returned to the inside of the ring, and Jeff was climbing the ladder, about to grab the World Heavyweight Championship while Edge climbed a ladder set up in the corner from earlier. Edge tried to Spear Jeff in mid-air, a reference to one of their TLC matches, but Jeff saw it coming and hit the Twist of Fate on Edge in mid-air!!! Jeff then started to climb, but Edge pulled him down and started to climb on the other side! Jeff quickly recovered and pulled Edge's body through the rungs so Edge was stuck, flailing like a fish!!! Jeff climbed the ladder and RETRIEVED THE TITLE!!! We have a new World Heavyweight Champion! Winner: Jeff Hardy. Match Rating: 5/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Jeff Hardy (Champion) vs. CM Punk
But Jeff's title reign was short lived. CM Punk ran out with his Money in the Bank contract, and he decided to cash it in right after the ladder match! Poor Jeff looked like a sad child as he prepared to face CM Punk. Punk didn't waste any time and hit the Go To Sleep on Jeff...BUT JEFF KICKED OUT!!! Astonished Punk went for the move again, but Jeff quickly rolled Punk up...only for a two. Punk's second attempt to nail the Go To Sleep connected and he pinned Hardy for the victory...and we have ANOTHER new World Heavyweight Champion! It wasn't really much of a match, but it was still exciting as hell. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 4/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS
Oh yes. Once again, I was very impressed with the backstage antics of the WWE superstars. CM Punk cashing in the Money in the Bank contract was only the tip of the iceberg though. Vickie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero are gold on screen together, despite the fact that Vickie can't really act worth a damn, and Edge announcing he wanted a divorce from Vickie after Vickie refused to get any Raw superstars to help Edge retain the World Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Hardy in the ladder match was awesome. Vickie and Chavo walking through the hallways and running into Hornswoggle and GOLDUST was GREAT! I love Goldust! Jericho also did a great promo through the arena before his match with his Mysterio that's worth checking out. Tommy Dreamer's celebration in the fans was reminiscent of the old ECW, and it was icing on the cake. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS
What the hell? The third straight pay-per-view in a row where the extras are barely anything at all. All you get here is an interview with Chris Jericho, alluding that he will stipulate a match where if Mysterio loses he will be banned from wearing his mask. If it wasn't for Jericho's good mic skills, this would be abysmal. Rating: 3/5

OVERALL EVENT
It wasn't as ""extreme"" as it promised to be, but the entire event was still pretty solid. The opening match was great, and I would love to see Matt Hardy, Kingston, Regal, and MVP do battle again. Jericho and Mysterio put on another match of the year caliber performance, as did Jeff Hardy and Edge in their phenomenal ladder match. CM Punk's Samoan Strap Match with Umaga was the third straight pay-per-view where Punk was disappointing, and it's a shame that Umaga's last pay-per-view mach in the WWE had to be a crapfest. Tommy Dreamer winning the ECW Championship was wildly entertaining and a long time coming. Santina Marella, Vickie Guerrero, and Chavo Guerrero made the Hog Pen match actually entertaining, while John Cena and The Big Show put on a match that wasn't terrible for once. Orton and Batista improved their match from Judgment Day, but they could still do better.",1248134400,,16482,4.581836665537106
3842998,3,B002436WHQ,"United States Champion Kofi Kingston Vs. William Regal Vs. M.V.P. Vs. Matt Hardy - This match started out fast paced but felt really rushed that caused some spots to be botched. A couple of good spots but nothing really notworthy. M.V.P.'s & Kofi Kingston U.S. Title Match from a week ago on Raw was better then this match. Still, a seemingly nice opening contest but surely could have been better. 2.75/5

Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio Vs. Chris Jericho (No Holds Barred Match) - Just like previously at Judgment Day, these two delivered a great match for the Intercontinental Title. Chris Jericho also delivered on his promise that he would win the Intercontinental Championship and unmask Rey Mysterio in the process which he did. The No Holds Barred stipulation came into effect many times as it helped both Chris Jericho & Rey Mysterio in the match as it helped them to counter and to inflect more punishment onto each other. Nothing wrong with this match as Chris Jericho & Rey Mysterio kept the match exciting all the way through and giving 100 percent and never missing a beat with the crowd getting more into the match as it went on. The ending was spectacular to keep this feud going which would end a month later at The Bash in a Title Versus Mask Match. This match was terrific and for me, it was the match of the night. 4.75/5

C.M. Punk Vs. Umaga (Samoan Strap Match) - C.M. Punk & Umaga looked a little off in this match. The match was just okay but C.M. Punk's and Umaga's styles seemed to not have meshed well together in this type of bout. C.M. Punk was playing the role as the underdog as Umaga was selling his size and strength in the match. Just an average match that's worthy of a watch. 2.75/5

ECW Champion Christian Vs. Tommy Dreamer Vs. Jack Swagger (Hardcore Rules Triple Threat Match) - This was a solid and fun Triple Threat ECW Title Match. All three participants got their spots in and they showcased a pretty good match. Not neccessarily a ""Hardcore Match"" but more of a weapons fill match. The fans were chanting ""WE WANT TABLES"" but got trash cans and kendo sticks instead. Still, this was a fun and good match and it was nice to see Tommy Dreamer finally winning the ECW Title. Though, it should've been awarded to him a long, long, long time ago but its still good to see Tommy Dreamer holding the title he worked all his life for. 3.5/5

Santina Marella Vs. Vickie Guerrero (Hog Pen Match) - This match was for the Undisputed Miss WrestleMania crown and it was also WRESTLING CRAP at it's best. You will either love or hate this match. But to me, the less said the better. 0/5

WWE Champion Randy Orton Vs. Batista (Steel Cage Match) - Even though this match only lasted around the 7 minute mark, Randy Orton & Dave Batista went non-stop and delivered great action in those 7 minutes. Dave was wrestling with a torn bicep muscle so you have to take that into consideration on the match length. Not better then their previous one on one battles but this match was good for what it was. 3/5

The Big Show Vs. John Cena (Submission Match) - The Big Show dominated the entire match as he was targeting the mid-section of John Cena's that he injured at Backlash while John Cena was showing his heart and determination not to surrender to the bigger & more powerful opposition. However, none of that match storytelling helped this match at all as we seen it countless times from these two in the past. Cena did his standard comeback match win to defeat The Big Show in the end as he trapped The Big Show's feet in the ropes and locked on a crossface to get The Big Show to tap out. The match was long, dry, dull, boring and the crowd wasn't into it at all. This was a weak match to say the least. 2.25/5

World Heavyweight Champion Edge Vs. Jeff Hardy (Ladder Match) - Quite honestly, this match disappointed me to an extent. It wasn't a classic as many thought it would be considering Edge's and Jeff Hardy's history in Ladder Matches. The match ended too soon but Edge and Jeff Hardy fought hard and delivered a good effort to deliver something the fans has never seen before. There was a couple of new innovative spots in the match Jeff Hardy & Edge came up with. The ending was clever as it was never done before, though it was useless at the same time. 4.25/5

World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy Vs. C.M. Punk - As the ""Hardy Party"" was about to begin again, here came C.M. Punk cashing in his Money In The Bank Briefcase against Jeff Hardy. Jeff Hardy was previously weaken in the Ladder Match with Edge as Edge damaged Hardy's legs. So C.M. Punk took advantage of the spaghetti legged Hardy right away and scored with the GTS but Hardy kicked out. Hardy fought with everyhting he had but it wasn't enough as he lost his newly awarded World Heavyweight Title to C.M. Punk after a second GTS. This would be the beginnings of C.M. Punk's heel turn. 2/5

3843000,3,B002436WHQ,"This was a very newsworthy show from WWE as there had been 5 title changes during the night.  I did not, however, think this was a great show.  I did like it, but only mildly, because the two matches I was looking foreward too (the IC title match and the Ladder match) were both very good.  I did not think it was nearly as good or as well-rounded as Backlash and Judgment Day, but it held its own. Personally, I would not purchase this on dvd, but it is worth a rental.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. United States Title Match
Kofi Kingston (c) vs. MVP vs. Matt Hardy vs. William Regal

Fast paced match to start, but it was rather short and felt rushed.  There were botched spots aplenty in this one, but they pulled out some nice moves as well.  Overall this was fine and the guys worked hard, and the match did it's job by getting the crowd pumped up. **

2. No Holds Barred Intercontinental Title Match
Rey Mysterio (c) vs. Chris Jericho

Another great match from these two.  The crowd wasn't particularly into it at first, but by the end they were going insane, which is a tremendous credit to the workers.  The pace was superb and they did their usual great moves, and I thought they worked the No Holds Barred stipulation in nicely by letting the fans know it was there but not going overboard with gimmicks (all they used was a steel chair).  The finish was also brilliant and allows for this fued to continue.  ***3/4

3. Samoan Strap Match
CM Punk vs. Umaga

There was not a lot of heat for this one.  The match was OK and nothing more, but I will say the ending was good.  Pretty average otherwise, not nearly as good as their match at Judgment Day.  *3/4

4. ECW Championship Hardcore Triple Threat Match
Christian (c) vs. Tommy Dreamer vs. Jack Swagger

This was a pretty fun match, and was good for what it was.  Fans wanted tables but they got trash cans and kendo sticks, and they used those two weapons for basically the entire match.  Personally I thought it went a little long, but that's just me.  Fans loved Tommy getting the win, and his celebration afterwards was really great.  **1/2

5. Hog Pen Match
""Santina"" Marella vs. Vickie Guerrero (w/ Chavo Guerrero)

I knew going in this was going to be bad, but this was SHOCKINGLY bad.  They had an absolutely hideous match, one of the worst I've seen in years.  Worst of all, with promos and the aftermath included, this probably wasted close to 20 minutes of ppv time.  I want to hear someone from WWE try and justify fans paying money for this.  - (negative) ***

6. WWE Championship Steel Cage Match
Randy Orton (c) vs. Big Dave Batista

This was the real shocker of the evening, as I did not think even for one second that Dave was going to win this match.  Not to mention that he pinned Orton clean as a sheet in the middle of the ring after about 7 minutes of action.  However, I do not have a serious issue with the length of the match, because for those 7 minutes it was all solid pro wrestling action instead of a long drawn out brawl.  Again, this was too short to really be good, but for what it was I liked it.  **1/4

7. Submission Match
John Cena vs. The Big Show

Very boring match.  This was basically the exact same boring match they had last month, only there were no pin fall attempts and subsequent near falls.  Big Show dominated Cena FOREVER with his slow plodding offense, and I was nearly dozing off.  At the end, Cena tangled Show's foot in between the middle and bottom rope, which took care of the ""t"" in stf, and then he applied a crossface.  Problem is, show's foot fell out and he had to pretend it was still there in that bent position.  This was not good folks, I pray that this fued is over.  3/4*

8. World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match
Edge (c) vs. Jeff Hardy

Very good match, but not quite the classic I was expecting.  They both worked really hard and tried some innovative moves, some of which were truly horrifying.  Unfortunately they didn't have a whole lot of time because of all the other matches on the show, so they may have had to cut some things out.  This match didn't blow me away like I thought it would, but like I said it was still very good and I was quite satisfied when it was over.  The finish was also great.  ***3/4

9. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Jeff Hardy (c) vs. CM Punk

Punk got a major mixed reaction coming out.  Basically, Punk hit the GTS, hardy kicked out, place went insane, hardy rolled up Punk and Punk kicked out, place went nuts, then Punk hit another GTS for the pin, and the crowd died.  The crowd was super into this untill the very end, and then there really wasn't a big pop for the title change.  That being said, this was GREAT for the one minute that it lasted.  (NR)

This show was a mixed bag.  It was very newsworthy and interesting, because I really don't know where they are going from here.  There were two great matches on the show and some fine little matches as well, but the middle of the card really dragged the show to a screeching halt, particularly the Hog Pen disaster and the Submission match.  If you really enjoy gimmick matches then I'd consider picking this up, otherwise save your money and rent it for a rainy day.  Overall I give this show a moderate thumbs up.",1244419200,6,5272,4.343589743589743
3843001,5,B002436WHQ,"Kofi Kingston VS William Regal VS Matt Hardy VS MVP: A botch fest with a few good spots. Could have been better if they had more time, it felt rushed.

Chris Jericho VS Rey Mysterio: A classic match and a breath of fresh air for the IC title. I hope they keep the feud going, i'd like to see more of these matches.

Umaga VS CM Punk: They had an icon indicating what posts they touched but it didn't work for awhile. CM Punk wins with a Go To Sleep and falls on the corner, pretty neat stuff.

Christian VS Jack Swagger VS Tommy Dreamer: I remember Dreamer saying his contract was up and WWE forgot about it for a month or two, I guess they hate long story lines now. Dreamer was squashed for those months and it was a mystery to me if he'd resign or not. I'm very happy Dreamer won but it's a blessing and a curse for him. It's a curse because he'll hold the belt for a month, if that, and lose it to Swagger or Christian. Then he'll be buried in the mix and thats a damn shame. I love Dreamer and hope for a lengthy title run but I know it just won't happen. This was a great match and a great moment,

Santina VS Vicky Guerrero: Oh my god! What a waste of time, it was one of the worst things i've ever seen in my life. Skip this at all cost.

Batista VS Randy Orton: Wow, who did Orton piss off? A short cage match that saw Batista win the title in the end and no outside interference from Legacy.

John Cena VS Big Show: The second worst match of the night. Cena has made Big Show tap before but I guess they think fans forget. A dreadful match with Cena winnning in the end.

Jeff Hardy VS Edge: A near classic match up and the titles changes hands, making it 3-for-3. Some fans thought Hardy signed a new WWE contract and would be staying around longer but here comes CM Punk! He cashes in the Money in the Bank and wins the world title away from Hardy. I guess no new contract had been signed yet.

Overall, two strong WWE ppvs in a row. All world titles change hands and the IC title might become relevant again. Smackdown is clearly the show to be watching with the Jericho-Mysterio match and the main event. Even though Raw has a new champion, it's still stale and predictable and Vickie is still the GM.",1244419200,,2215,4.111111111111111

  Umaga vs C.M Punk in a strap match: Punk hits the Go to Sleep and then slapped the final corner for the win. Match was more than that, but that's all I remember lol.

  Christian defending the ECW World title vs Tommy Dreamer vs Jack Swagger: Went back and forth until Swagger slammed Christian face first on an exposed turnbuckle, went for his finisher but got hit by a barbed wire bat by Dreamer. Dreamer then executed a DDT on Swagger for the win to be champ and save his career.

  Santina vs Vicky Guerrero in a Hog Pen Match (Miss WrestleMania): Vicky called in Chavo for help but Santina/Santino still got the win when he/she slopped Vicky, put the slop bucket on Chavo's head and then pushed Vicky down for the pin.

  Batista vs Randy Orton (WWE title) in a Steelcage: I'm not into anything that has to do with Batista but can tell you that he won with a Batista bomb off the turnbuckle ""I think"". I can't believe Batista is a 5 time World Champ, it shows that it's a time where the WWE will give anyone but talented wrestlers multiple title reighns ""with the exception of Edge and yeah HHH too even though he just pushes himself.""

  Cena vs Big Show in a submission match: Do I even have to say who won ?? When Cena feuds with someone, the first match is to win with the Attitude Adjustment and the rematch is to win with the STF. So yeah, that's how this match went. If you are scratching your head wondering what I mean. Cena made Show tap to the STF.

  Jeff Hardy vs Edge in a Ladder Match (World title): Was a lot of bumps but Hardy won when Edge got stuck in the Ladder and Hardy grabbed the belt.

  C.M Punk vs Jeff Hardy (World Title): Punk cashed in Money in the Bank right after Hardy won. Punk quickly hit one Go to Sleep and Jeff kicked out, Punk quickly hit another on Jeff to win the title! Hardy deserves one long reign, if crappy wrestlers like Cena and Batista can have long reigns, then so can Jeff Hardy! Hell, he deserves it much more. Still, I like Punk though. Am sort of hoping he turns heel, since he did royally screw over Jeff.",1244332800,,2405,4.235164835164835

8350212,5,B002436WHQ,"The 1st ever Extreme Rules PPV was a major hit, I enjoyed almost all of it. I loved it live and still enjoy it on DVD today

1. Fatal 4 Way for the United States Championship
Kofi Kingston v. William Regal v. Matt Hardy v. MVP
Entertaining match overall. Still odd seeing Hardy as a heel, the crowd isn't really sure how to react to him. MVP as a baby face is a major hit. Kingston wins with his 2nd to none athleticism to retain his title. 7/10

2. No Holds Barred Match for the IC title. Rey Mysterio v. Chris Jericho
Personally 2 of my favorite superstars ever, didn't disappoint of course. Both went back and forth with finishing moves. I do wish more than Steel Chairs were used being that it was an extreme rules PPV, but they used the chairs well. Jericho ripped off Rey's mask and pinned him to win the title. 8/10

3. Samoan Strap Match.
CM Punk VS. Umaga
This match was okay, it's kind of a neat type of match with the guys tied to each other, reminded me of that Texas Bull Rope match with JBL and Latino Heat a few years back. Nothing too exciting but decent match anyways. 6.5/10

4. Triple Threat Hardcore Match for the ECW Championship
Christian VS. Jack Swagger VS. Tommy Dreamer
Really good match overall all 3 were definitely entertaining. The crowd wanted tables but did not get them and I think they should have because tables were not used the entire PPV and this would of been the match to utilize tables. Tommy Dreamer probably shocked some people winning the title but the crowd loved it. 7.5/10

5. Hog Pen match for the Miss Wrestlemania crown
Vickie & Chavo VS. Santina Marella
Well, I didn't say the PPV was flawless. More of a comical match than entertaining to watch. Chavo nearly fell on real live pigs during the match! Chavo and Vicki ended up covered in mud and Santina retained his/her crown. 3.5/10

6. Steel Cage match for WWE title
Batista VS. Orton
Good match but it was a tad too short. I think it was around 8-9 minutes. The steel cage was barely utilized. Batista countered a RKO into a Batista bomb and just clean pinned Orton to win the title. 7/10

Ladder Match for World Heavyweight title
Jeff Hardy VS. Edge
Best match of the night of course with 2 ladder veterans. Lots of good stunts and ladder usage in the match. Jeff got Edge's legs stuck in the ladder so he climbed up there and grabbed the title to win it.

BUT out of no where, a shock to most people watching live (because he had a match earlier in the PPV) CM Punk came to cash in his money in the bank on Hardy. Hit him with 2 GTS' to win the title. The crowd was mixed they had really just enjoyed Hardy winning the title from Edge. Overall 9.5/10",1460246400,,2656,4.3086172344689375

8350214,4,B002436WHQ,"1. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Matt Hardy vs. William Regal: First of all if you notice the title of the ppv ""extreme rules"" this match did not fall under that category. The match itself was not horrible yet it was not good, but at least they put the non extreme match first.
2. Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho No Holds Bared for I.C title: This match was a good I.C title match, but the no holds Bared did not come into key in this much. The ending was a little shocking but I will let you find that out for your self.
3. Christian vs. Tommy Dreamer vs. Jack Swagger Hardcore Rules For ECW title: This match was good for what ECW had to offer at that time. The Hardcore actually came into play and also it was a perfect time for the match.
4. CM Punk vs. Umaga Samoan Strap Match: This match was one of the best strap matches I've seen or any other match of that nature. The match had a good length, no man dominated the whole match, and most important was good wrestling, but that's just my opinion.
5. Santina Marella vs. Vickie Guerrero Hog Pen Match for Miss WrestleMania Crown: This match in my eyes was just for pure entertainment. Even thou this match was fun to watch and it was it just had poor wrestling but what did you expect.
6. Randy Orton vs. Batista Steel Cage Match for WWE title: I thought this match was a little short for a WWE title Match. There was no blood no nothing but what do you expect when WWE goes PG.
7. John Cena vs. Big Show Submission Match: This was a great submission match. Great amount of time good wrestling not one man was in control the whole match. Plus the ending was funny and smart, but I will let you watch to find out yourself.
8. Jeff Hardy vs. Edge Ladder Match for World Heavyweight title: This was a great ladder match considering arguably the two best men to ever be in a ladder match where facing each for the first time one on one in a ladder match. There where a lot of great moments in this match the way it was won was pretty creative and funny. Plus after that there was bonus match if you know what I mean.

Overall: I give this 4 stars. Because a few of the matches did not fall under the category Extreme Rules or the match was not as good as it should have been. I would recommend this ppv, but I would look into it more. For example read more reviews or watch the highlights for this ppv.

EXTREME RULES 2009
Spoilers

1.[FATAL FOUR WAY US TITLE]KOFI KINGSTON VS WILLIAM REGAL VS MVP VS MATT HARDY-we start the night out with a four way for the us title and with the four guys involved it could have been classic. While it was far from that it proved to be a good opener. The action was well paced especially as the match went on, although I wanted Regal to win this Kofi pulls off a nice win.

2.[NO HOLDS BARRED I-C TITLE]REY MYSTERIO VS CHRIS JERICHO-the best match of the night in my opinion here. Both guys pull out all the stops here going back and forth with some great moves. Each getting their signature stuff while keeping the pace nice and quick. Still the best thing about this great match is the awesome ending. The way Jericho wins the belt is brilliant.

3.[SAMOAN STRAP MATCH]CM PUNK VS UMAGA-now these strap matches usually go one of two ways, either a straight up classic, or hard to watch. This one comes in some where in between. It is by no means even close to a classic but it isn't brutal to watch either. It is the touch all four corners stipulation thing and the action is what you would expect. Umaga uses his power while Punk uses his speed and they both use the strap in various ways. Punk pulls out the win here in a match that could have been better.

4.[EXTREME RULES ECW TITLE]CHRISTIAN VS TOMMY DREAMER VS JACK SWAGGER-my favorite match of the night because one of my all time favorite wrestlers ever Tommy Dreamer would win the ECW title once again. The thing for this match was if he lost he would leave wrestling, but he had to go through Christian and Swagger. The match was a really fun one that reminded me of the old ECW in the ways the weapons were used. Tommy seemed like he did in the old days as he took it to both guys and got the pin over Swagger. His celebration afterward was excellent and the fans were really into it, ""ECW ECW ECW"".

5.[HOG PEN MATCH]VICKIE GUERRERO VS SANTINA MARELLA-man it had been a long time since I had seen a hog pen match, I seem to remember Triple H in one of these as well. That match of course was back in like 95 or 96 but any way that is not this match is it. Vickie makes this a handicap match with Chavo coming in to help her, kinda funny. That of course is what this match is all about, comedy. It is a fun match and serves its purpose, Santina gets the win here.

6.[STEEL CAGE WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS BATISTA-I can't stand when the champ comes out first, champ comes out last and that is just how that is supposed to work. Now this was a shorter match than I thought it was going to be but it was good. Batista really brought it to Randy here beating him all over the cage. Randy only landed offense only to try and escape. Also when watching this match again it kinda struck me as one of those cage matches from the 90's for some reason.. Batista gets the win and the title after a Batista bomb in a pretty good cage match.

7.[SUBMISSION MATCH]BIG SHOW VS JOHN CENA-now this is a rematch as I am sure all reading this know by now. This was a decent match but it really could have been better. In fact these two have had better matches before in the past. The story here was all about if Cena could get the STF on the Big Show. Of course Cena eventually gets the win after he successfully puts the STF on Show. Also it is funny how the commentators sell this match after it was over.

8.[LADDER MATCH]EDGE VS JEFF HARDY-now I have to say from the start that I can not stand Jeff Hardy, never have and never will most likely. Still going in I was pretty sure this was going to be a good match. These two have been in many a ladder match and have looked good in all of them. Like I thought this was one of the best matches of the night. There are all kinds of great spots here but at the same time it is not a crazy spot fest either. There is a cool little twist on the ending that leads to Hardy getting the belt once again. But thankfully CM Punk comes out and cashes in his MITB briefcase to get a title shot right afterwards. After a little back and forth in pin falls Punk hits his GTS for a second time and gets the belt.

This was a good event but certainly not the best ever but I do indeed love the ending here, you also get an interview with Jericho as the special feature.",1318636800,,4282,4.168077388149939
8350217,2,B002436WHQ,This is worse then the 2008 becuase this time there were only 2 good matches. The first one was Y2J vs Rey-Rey for the IC title which stole the show and had the perfect finish. The second one was the ladder match for the World's title which was an epic brawl. The Hog pen match was one of the worst and most dumbest matches I ever seen and I saw every match with Doink The Clown in them. The Submission match between John Cena & Big Show looked like it kept on going & going & going just like the bunny from the battery commercials and it's the same basic match only without the pinfalls. The rest of them were second to third rate. I give this PPV a 3 out of 10.,1277337600,,663,3.992481203007519
8350218,3,B002436WHQ,"As the title said, Extreme Rules 2009 is full of simply par matches.  I'll get to the reviews and hit my final thoughts at the end.

U.S. Title
Fatal Four Way
Kofi Kingston vs MVP vs William Regal vs Matt Hardy
Short match here.  It was an okay opener.  There is a constant stream of movement and action going on.  The good flow doesn't make it an eye catching match though.  Way too short at 6 minutes.  5/10

IC Title
No Holds Barred
Chris Jericho vs Rey Mysterio
By far this is the 2nd best match on the card.  Really great back and forth match.  Great chemistry and story telling between these two.  They played with the stipulation perfectly.  They used the no holds barred theme to a minimum, but when they used it they optimized it.  8.5/10

Strap Match
CM Punk vs Umaga
Crowd was really not feeling this one, which never helps a match.  The rules of this strap match were the same as the JBL/Guerrero bull rope match from 2004.  You had to touch all four corners in a row.  I'm not a huge fan of this format.  The match has a few stiff strap spots, but it relatively slow for the most part.  I wanted to like this one more than I did.  5.5/10

ECW Title
Hardcore Match
Jack Swagger vs Tommy Dreamer vs Christian
A good way to describe this match would be as follows:  Think of all of the hardcore title matches from the WWE circa 1999 and 2000 (The ones with all the trash cans, kendo sticks, and trash can lids).  Now take those matches, make the crowd care a little more, and turn the volume up on the matches to make them a little better.  That's pretty much what we have here.  It's entertaining; I was never bored thoughout it.  It's not really memorable in any capacity though.  6/10

Hog Pen Match
Santino Marella vs Vickie Guerrero/Chavo Guerrero
I did not watch this match because I did not care.  I can imagine it was terrible though.

WWE Championship
Steel Cage Match
Randy Orton vs Batista
It's okay.  That's really all i can say here.  It's very short at 7 minutes, but that helped this match I believe.  It allowed them to have a constant flow of action, it just wasn't ever that great.  Underwhelming match by all means, though it was probably the best Batista/Orton encounter we have ever had.  5.5/10

Submission Match
John Cena vs the Big Show
Similiar to the strap match from earlier, in the fact that I wanted to like it more than I did.  John Cena and the Big Show seem to have trouble finding their chemistry in this match.  It has moments and minutes that are definitely better than others.  Crowd enjoys it which helps the match.  I liked the 19 minute length, because it at least gave them time to do all that they could.  6.5/10

World Heavyweight Title
Ladder Match
Jeff Hardy vs Edge
By far the match of the night here.  I really loved this match.  They made this one manage to be different from other ladder matches we have seen lately.  It reminded me somewhat of the Rock/Triple H ladder match, in the fact that it was not all high spots (although there are definitely some great spots to don't think you are going to be disappointed).  There was some great chemistry and psychology with these two.  I loved this match and could watch it over and over.  9.5/10

As you can tell, there are really two matches worth tuning into on this DVD.  Those two matches are great.  But everything else is largely forgettable.  Is the DVD worth buying?  I would say no.  You can catch the ladder match on the new World Heavyweigh Title DVD (alot of other good matches there too).",1262217600,,3506,4.378504672897196
8350219,3,B002436WHQ,"""Extreme Rules 2009"" is par for the course this year in WWE PPVs.  It neither blows your mind, nor does it bore the hell out of you.  Oddly enough, the more family-friendly direction for an ""Extreme Rules"" event isn't the main problem.  There are deeper issues in store:

1) United States Championship
Kofi Kingston (champion) v. William Regal v. Matt Hardy v. MVP
---In case you care, the only Extreme part here is that Fatal Fourway Matches are No-DQ, which doesn't even factor in anyway.  Not to dismiss the work of these four men, but I bet you can guess what kind of match you're gonna see here.  This opening contest isn't going to surprise you, but it's going to entertain you and set the tone.  You're gonna see all four men bounce around the ring, get their one-on-one chances to shine, and get near-falls that you knew weren't gonna get a three-count.  You're gonna see some suplexes from Regal & MVP, some one-handed action from Matt Hardy, and some Jamaican-Me-Crazy stuff from Kofi.  It's forgettable, but it's fun, and it gets you ready for the rest of the event.
""6.5 / 10""
__________________________________________

2) No Holds Barred - Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho v. Rey Mysterio (champion)
---The first thing you need to remember is that this isn't one of those matches that rely on weapons or high-risk spots to get your attention.  It's another strong wrestling match between two gifted veterans that includes a couple of ""anything-goes"" moments.  But more importantly, it's Jericho and Mysterio putting on another impressive contest that surpasses their ""Judgment Day"" showdown, but doesn't quite match their ""Bash"" classic.  Then again, does it really matter which match is best?  These two have had the best in-ring rivalry so far this year, and I doubt there will be a better one.
""7.5 / 10""
__________________________________________

3) Samoan Strap Match
Umaga v. CM Punk
---Surprisingly boring considering the talent involved.  Umaga is one of the more gifted larger athletes, and CM Punk is one of those performers you can't classify.  I like four corners matches like this, but this one didn't do it for me.  I think that's mainly due to Umaga being even more dominant than he was with the ""Judgment Day"" opener between these two.  Plus, the Strap doesn't really come into play all that much.  It's almost like these guys could've have the exact same match, except throw in a couple of tug-of-wars and the corner tapping feature.  I admire that these two were going for something different (one of the central focuses is Punk trying to lift Umaga for the GTS).  But in the end, my mind wandered more than it should have.
""4.5 / 10""
__________________________________________

4) Hardcore Match - ECW Championship
Christian (champion) v. Tommy Dreamer v. Jack Swagger
---Bad news first: This isn't an old-school ECW match where everyone becomes a broken, bloody and/or bruised mess.  Now for the good news, it's still one entertaining ride.  These three guys try very few traditional wrestling maneuvers.  It's one of those blasts from the WWF past, where ""hardcore"" matches meant you grab a toy, and swing away.  Jack Swagger is appropriately the least successful when using the weapons, but he's talented enough to pull off some impressive moves, not to mention tough enough to put up with the pain he did.  Christian is the exceptional wrestler he's expected to be, with a good dose of wrestling and hardcore skills.  But this is Tommy Dreamer's night, and what a glorious one.  Dreamer gets to pull out all sorts of tricks we rarely get to see him use anymore, and his title victory is a much-deserved honor.  The championship may be made of silver, but someone as humble and dedicated as Tommy Dreamer probably doesn't care.  Besides, I'm sure all three men are just as proud of their Hardcore Match as we are pleased to have witnessed it.
""7.0 / 10""
__________________________________________

5) Hog Pen Match for the ""Miss WrestleMania"" Crown
Santina Marella v. Vickie Guerrero & Chavo Guerrero
---Why, oh why, oh f___king why?  There are many reasons why this was a terrible reason to begin with, but I'll focus on two of them.  First off, I'm all for comic relief and understand taking a break from hard-hitting action.  But this Hog Pen disaster simply isn't funny, and it's another embarrassing attempt from the WWE to try to make us laugh.  Secondly, the match doesn't `SOUND' good.  Mud and hog pens are soft surfaces, so there's no sound to get us into the fight.  You can't hear the punches, you can't hear the falls, and you can barely hear the dialogue.  Now...combine these with every other insult that everybody else has hurled at this waste of time, and you've got a PPV catastrophe.  It's not even ""so-bad-it's-funny""...it's aggravatingly awful.
""1.5 / 10""
__________________________________________

6) Steel Cage Match - WWE Championship
Randy Orton (champion) v. Batista
---The build up was solid.  The two rivals deserved a rematch.  The match type was perfect.  Unfortunately, we only got 7 minutes after all the hype.  Some hardcore fans expected something like this; it was leaked that Batista was injured going into the match.  Thankfully, Orton getting dominated hasn't hurt his career much.  But it does hurt this PPV.  Orton and Batista use a small number of moves to begin with, but there was hardly any sort of Cage suspense or brutality.  I don't need blood, but I need to be surprised.  I guess I didn't think WWE would surprise me like this.  This Steel Cage Match is entertaining while it lasts, but leaves you feeling empty afterwards.
""6.0 / 10""
__________________________________________

7) Submission Match
Big Show v. John Cena
---`IF' you read my ""Judgment Day 2009"" review - (you faithful few) - you might remember that I hate when these two guys mix it up.  You may also recall that I thought that particular match was god-awful.  Well, they somehow managed to put on their best match together at ""Extreme Rules"".  I'm dead serious; there is more back-and-forth battling between Big Show and Cena.  The match is kept to a decent pace, and it's one of those rare underdog matches I wasn't bored by.  The only real problem (and it's a big one) is that it's just too darn long.  I can tolerate Cena constantly getting stopped in his tracks every time he gains momentum.  After all, John Cena is 200 pounds lighter than Big Show.  But it becomes repetitive after a while, which ruins a potentially `good' match.  Plus, the finish was poorly-executed.  I expected this match to ruin the PPV; instead, it kept it from getting any worse.
""6.0 / 10""
__________________________________________

8) Ladder Match - World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion) v. Jeff Hardy
---These two men are probably more responsible for the WWE's Ladder Match lineage than any other in the company's history.  But after 10 years of innovation, it's sad to think that there's not much Edge or Jeff Hardy could've done to top themselves, let alone make the match fresh.  As it stands, both guys put on a very solid match to end their rivalry, filled with a few Ladder spots I hadn't seen before.  The New Orleans crowd was surprisingly quiet for most of this main event (most of the PPV, actually).  But one thing that's been bothering me with Ladder Matches lately is that the wrestlers don't try to grab the belt often.  It's almost like they're more focused on punishing the other guy for 20 minutes, rather than just knocking him down to grab the strap.  That might not seem like a big deal, but it kinda took me out of this one from time to time.  But don't let that last comment discourage you from checking this one out.  Jeff Hardy and Edge took some serious risks (even by their standards), and put on one of the PPV's best matches.  Just don't expect a show-stopper.
""7.5 / 10""
__________________________________________

As we all know, CM Punk cashed in his Money-In-The-Bank briefcase to win Jeff Hardy's hard-fought World Heavyweight Championship.  I give a ton of credit to WWE for not trying to make us like CM Punk taking the strap from Jeff.  His MITB win wasn't well-received at ""WrestleMania"", and even though his weekly efforts to get his title match were delayed, WWE wisely didn't ask us to celebrate Punk's opportunistic victory.  Has there been a better character development in the past few years?  Doubtful, in my book.
__________________________________________

You know, even with a handful of good matches, ""Extreme Rules 2009"" is probably my least favorite WWE PPV so far this year.  Aside from the excellent Ladder Match and IC Title contest, not much really stands out.  I think my 3-star score is mostly due to the Hog Pen Match, and also because the WWE Championship Steel Cage Match was really just a throwaway (Batista was written out of storylines the next night).

It's kinda frustrating for reviewers like me, because WWE's repeated middle-of-the-road quality forces me to write the same formulaic review:

""It's Not Bad, But It's Not Great Either.""
""It Has Some Great Things, But It's Nothing To Go Out Of Your Way To See.""

C'mon, WWE.  Gimme something better to type, will ya?  I don't mind a more PG version of ""Extreme Rules"", but I do mind when even 20 dollars seems too high for a WWE DVD.",1252195200,,9308,4.870782940802037
8350220,3,B002436WHQ,"1)Kofi Kingston,MVP,Matt Hardy,William Regal US Title 8/10
This match suffers from the time limit but it's a good match for the time it is given with only 8 minutes to work with all the competitors put on a nice show with Kofi being the most entertaining part of the match everyone gets some nice shots in the ending comes relatively quickly but its a decent match
2)Rey Mysterio vs Chris Jericho IC Title 9/10
This is my least favorite match in their feud with the best being at The Bash but with that being said this is still the 2nd best match on the card the action picks up quickly and doesn't slow down plenty of near falls and reversals the no DQ doesnt come into play much except for a chair shot i wasn't a big fan of the ending but it extended the feud so it works
3)CM Punk vs Umaga Samoan Strap Match 7/10
This match was better than expected Punk is one of the few people that can pull a good match out of Umaga this one is slightly better than their Judgment Day match IMO Umaga doesnt dominate as much Punk gets in some nice shots and there are alot of close finishes Punk finally hits the GTS to win
4)Christian vs Tommy Dreamer vs Jack Swagger ECW Title 8/10
This match disappointed me a little bit if you're expecting an ECW type weapons filled match you won't get it and it also suffers from what makes a triple threat great the near falls and saves which doesnt happen much but its still an enjoyable title match it gets a higher rating because of the emotional nature of the win for Dreamer
5)Vickie Guerrero vs Santina Marella 0/10
This is a huge waste of time that could have been added to other matches on the card why does this segment get more time than the US title match it makes no sense its not entertaining its not even funny its just boring and useless
6)Randy Orton vs Batista WWE Title 6/10
This match suffers because Batista was injured which begs the question why even give him the title in the first place it only lasts about 7 minutes and that mostly consists of Orton trying to run and escape so you get very little action this is probably the worst title match of the year so far
7)John Cena vs Big Show Submission Match 5/10
Just as boring if not more so than their Judgment Day match i wanted to take a 20 minute long nap while this match was going on this feud is not gonna work when is WWE gonna realize it Big Show dominates again then Cena fights back at the end to win with the worst submission ever Big Show's foot actually falls off the ropes so its basically just a weak crossface Cena wins again YAWN
8)Edge vs Jeff Hardy World Title 10/10
While this is not the best ladder match i've ever seen it is definately the best match of the night both men take some hard falls but why the ladder change they look like very cheap ladders as u can tell when Edge and Hardy snap the ladder like nothing Edge gets pulled through the rung while hardy wins the title once again then we all know what happens next Punk cashes in the Money In The Bank contract to take the title from Hardy another short reign no wonder he's unhappy with WWE",1250380800,,3076,4.2419080068143105

No Holds Barred Match: Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho - One of the best feuds of the year (if not THE BEST just based on the matches alone) continue here as they stuck the formula that was worked with great wrestling that had the fans get more into it and added the No Holds Barred element well here but didn't overdo it using a mass amount of weapons as only a chair was used.  The crowd got more into it as time passed & had a very creative finish that also makes sure this feud will continue...and that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing! (thanks DDP)  Match of the night for me.

Strap Match: C.M. Punk vs. Umaga - This is one of those one of those matches where the gimmick hurt the match more than helped and the being absolutely dead didn't do it any favors either.  This was under the ""touch all four turnbuckles"" stipulations & there really isn't much to say or remember here except that this ended up being Umaga's last match in WWE.

Extreme Rules Match: ECW Champion Christian vs. Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer - This was ""do or die"" for Tommy Dreamer as we would leave WWE if he didn't win the championship here.  Tommy Dreamer went back to his ""Innovator Of Violence"" ways here by coming up with some different ways to use the weapons & breaking out some of his old spots which lead to the first ""ECW"" chants I've heard in WWE in a very long time.  This was a very fun match & the emotional aftermath was well deserved as well.

Hog Pen Match for the Miss WrestleMania Crown: ""Santina"" Marella vs. Vickie Guerrero - I'm going to be honest, I never found Santina to be funny & I didn't even watch this...I pressed the skip button right away since the only noteworthy thing here was that this turned out to be one of Vickie's last appearences as she quit the next night.

Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - For those who didn't already know, Batista had already reinjured himself (after being back for around 2 months) going into this match so it was kept short but because of that.  Despite all that, this turned out to be their best PPV match because it had the high impact & intensity that their previous matches were lacking.  It was a dominate performance by Batista that resulted in the first ever time the WWE Championship changed hands in a steel cage match...it you don't count the Elimination Chamber back in Feb.  This was good concidering how Batista was injured.

Submission Match: John Cena vs. Big Show - This was the second match that was a rematch from Judgment Day that used the same formula in their previous match...however, this gave up the complete opposite result that the Mysterio/Jericho match did as this is possibly the worst feud of the year so far.  Cena was again getting dominated by Show for what seemed like forever before he made his comeback & even had a finish with the STF that got botched.  Another match that I would press the skip button on because these two just don't have the chemistry that they had 5 years ago.

Ladder Match: World Champion Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - I'll give credit in that they've tried to do what Jericho/Michaels did at No Mercy in delivering a different type of ladder match than the usual ""non-stop spotfest"" that we're used to seeing.  They tried to find new ways to use the ladder in this match along with revisiting old ""highlight reel"" spots from all their previous ladder matches.  Again, it was a good match but it wasn't the blowaway classic everyone was expecting...but to be fair, they've set the bar so high for the past decade in regards to ladder matches that they just couldn't top it in this case.  This was one of those matches where if you judge it on it's own instead of comparing it to all of their past ladder matches (I counted at least six) then it's a good match.  But the major story at the end of the night was the aftermath that resulted in a new World Champion...AGAIN!

The only DVD extra here was a post-match interview with Chris Jericho setting up the next stage in their feud.  In the end, this ranks right around there with the 2007 edition as one of the most dissapointing editions of this PPV because there was just as much good here as there was stuff that's either bad or easily forgettable so this is one I would recommend for a rental & make your own call here.",1249862400,,4559,4.433532934131737
