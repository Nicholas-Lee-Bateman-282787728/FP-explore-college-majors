420032,2,6302045916,"Okay, this is a terrible movie. A terrible movie I've probably watched a dozen times. So bad, the B&W cover art isn't the original movie poster. So bad it never came out on DVD. It's a rip off of Animal House (Tim Matheson and Stephen Furst are together again for this non-classic) and many other summer, college outcasts vs. frat boys, screwball comedies of the late 70's and early 80's. With that said, if you like movies like One Crazy Summer, Porky's (Dan Monahan is in this one too) and Making the Grade, then this a sure thing (not that Sure Thing).

420087,5,6302045916,"Why in the world do you feel good watching this? Just don't know but this is one of those 80s flicks that just makes you feel good after seeing this.
The theme for a lot of 80s flicks was the underdog wins in the end. I don't know if that is the draw or what. The cinematography is not spectacular, the acting is not superior, it just makes you feel good I don't think movies are not supposed to be mind engaging, just a break from reality. This just has a good feeling for every underdog that was trying to do the right thing and never got the recognition they deserved. I feel good after watching this and is that not what a movie is supposed to do? There were far more ""geeks"" in high school than all the cool kids combined. In the end the only thing that matters is what you are and what you stand for and that is what this movie means to me.",1459555200,,846,4.041666666666667

420089,3,6302045916,It's the typical underdog story if being held down by the rich cheating group and overcoming the obstacles to win the big race and get the rich guys girl.  It has people way too old to be in college...but they are your favorites from past underdog movies like Animal House and Porky's.  It has some funny moments...it's more nostalgic for me from days working at the video store before DVD's.,1459209600,,392,4.585714285714285

420106,1,6302045916,"I am a huge fan of these types of movies, B rated campy & fun type...this one however, is NOT that movie. I watched the trailer & immediately thought it would be a fun-filled comedy adventure, so I bought it. My wife & I sat down to watch it & that's where it all went wrong. Not only is the movie itself lackluster, beyond boring, & extremely under-delivered...the Blu Ray version is absolutely horrid. The audio quality is bad, sharp & piercing. I had to turn the volume down quite a bit due to its very high pitched frequencies.

To sum it up, do your research on this movie...it was a $20 dud for us, I would still believe that I wasted my money if it were only $5.",1457308800,5,669,4.186046511627907

This should've been a massive hit! Great cast and plot with great laughs and T&A. Can't believe this hasn't gotten a proper bluray/DVD release. My dvr copy I purchased on Amazon is great. Perfect play and picture. It gave me trust in the ""dvr"" rare dvd's for sale. I liked this better than Hardbodies and such. Really good for the genre. Of course a terrific soundtrack helps. Like the best film of the decades party movies ""Spring Break"", Cheap Trick does the title song. I should've known it would be cool just from that! So glad I finally watched/own this movie.

420252,3,6302045916,"People considering buying the DVD version of this movie PLEASE READ !!
I like this 1984 movie, and there are many other reviewers who have discussed it's merits.
However, my review is not about the movie. Instead, it is specifically about the DVD version, and things you might like to be aware of...
This DVD version is manufactured from MGM using DVD-R technology. And as such, it appears to essentially be a videotape cassette copy that has been transferred to DVD.
The picture quality is only slightly better than you would get from a good condition videotape cassette playing on a modern HD Television. There is no image pixelation, however it is quite grainy (possibly caused by an attempt to sharpen the image).
The sound quality is 2-channel stereo, equivalent to the videotape cassette.
And although it is presented in Widescreen 1.85:1, unfortunately that is merely a crop of a Fullscreen 1.33:1 copy (possibly from a videotape cassette). Thus, the original imagery is missing from the top and bottom of the screen. This is what disappointed me the most !!
You decide...

420347,4,6302045916,"Whenever someone mentions or makes a list of best ""frat comedies"", you get the usual suspects. ""Animal House"", ""Revenge of The Nerds"", etc. Hardly ever mentioned or recalled is this little gem from 1984. And that is a shame. It's every bit as good and fun as some of the other well known movies, and should get more recognition if these are the kinds of movies you like.

""Up The Creek"" centers on 4 horrible students from a military academy that has seen better days. The dean of the institution makes these four men enter into a water rafting contest in the hopes of winning the big trophy and bringing some attention and prestige to the school. In turn, he will give them a degree in any subject they like. It's not all smooth sailing when an preppy, upper class group of rafters try to sabotage them any way they can.

The movie is fun for fun's sake, and you couldn't ask for a better, more likeable 80s cast. The main guy of the four is none other than Tim Matheson (who was in his mid 30s playing a military academy student), and the others were Stephen Furst (""Animal House"", ""Class Reunion"", ""Midnight Madness"") playing another slob; Dan Monahan (""Porky's""), and veteran actor Sandy Helberg (Who is the father of ""The Big Bang Theory's Simon Helberg). Other well known faces here include James B. Sikking (""Doogie Howser""), John Hillerman (""Magnum P.I.""), Jennifer Runyon (""Charles In Charge"", ""A Very Brady Christmas""), Julia Montgomery (""Revenge Of The Nerds"") and Jeff East (young Clark Kent in ""Superman"").

""Up The Creek"" is no great art, but you like our four main guys and root for them to win and stick it in the faces of the preppies. It's low brow humor, sure, but it's fun low brow humor that this very 80s genre can only provide. The characters are likeable, the comedy juvenile and entertaining, and it contains some fun scenes on the water. It is an oh-so-80s movie with all the hallmarks one expects from this kind of movie from the anything-goes-decade. They really don't make 'em like this anymore. While it doesn't rise to the iconic greatness of, say, ""Animal House"", it is certainly better than anything that has come from the ""Porky's"" trilogy. Just turn the lights off and enjoy the (wet) ride.",1369440000,,2225,4.670918367346939

420371,3,6302045916,"The 1980's, a decade known for its many ""college romp"" films.  Some good, some bad, but if their was one thing they all had in common...all were sexual comedies with plenty of nudity.

And in 1984, one of those films that many people would catch on cable was ""Up the Creek"", a film directed by Robert Butler (best known for directing TV series episodes such as ""Reminton Steele"" and ""Hill Street Blues"") and an earlier film written by Jim Kouf (""Rush Hour"", ""National Treasure"" films, ""Grimm"" and ""Ghost Whisperer"" TV series).

The film would star Tim Matheson (""Van Wilder"", ""Animal House"", ""Fletch""), Jennifer Runyon (""Ghostbusters"", ""Charles in Charge"", ""Carnosaur""), Stephen Furst (""Animal House"", ""Babylon 5'), Dan Monohan (""Porkys"" films) Sandy Helberg (""Mortal Kombat"", ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Spaceballs""), Jeff East (""Superman"", ""The Day After"") and James Sikking (""Hill Street Blues"", ""General Hospital"", ""Doogie Howser, M.D."").

""Up the Creek"" features four friends Bob (played by Tim Matheson), Max (played by Don Monahan), Irwin (played by Sandy Helberg) and Gonzer (played by Stephen Furst) who attend Lepetomane University (aka Lobotomy U), the worst university in the area , and each happen to be the worst students on campus.  They are forcefully recruited by Dean Burch (played by John Hillerman) to compete in the collegiate raft race and bring some recognition to the university.

In return, if they win, he will offer them degrees in the major of their choice.

So, the four friends along with their dog Chuck (voiced by Frank Welker) head to the collegiate raft race.  But the team that is heavily favored to win are the Ivy University prep schoolers who have the support of Ivy alumnus Dr. Roland Tozer, who wants to ensure that the group cheats their way to the #1 spot.

Also competing are the military squad known as Washington Military Institute who's leader Captain Braverman (played by Blaine Novak), wants revenge against Bob because he continually thwarts the group's plan of sabotage.  Also, entered are the co-eds, which include Heather Merriweather (played by Jennifer Runyon) who has had enough of her boyfriend (a member of the Ivy University) messing around with other women, so she starts to show interest in Bob.

With Ivy University trying to cheat their way to the top, do the underachieving students of Lepetomane University have a chance of winning the competition?

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's is its manufacturing. Granted, those problems were a long time ago but so far, I have not had any problems with MGM's Limited Edition Collection.

With ""The Magnetic Monster"", its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played ""The Magnetic Monster"" on my Blu-ray player and DVD player with no problems. I then played it on my Mac and PC, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

""Up the Creek"" is presented in color (1:85:1 full frame). As far as picture quality goes, you can see a bit of black specks throughout the film but they are small and probably will not be noticed by most people. There is a fine layer of grain and for the most part, for an '80s film, the movie looks very good for its age.  There is some softness but considering its age, ""Up the Creek"" looks good on DVD.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital.  But the film is notable for its soundtrack featuring Cheap Trick, Heart and The Beach Boys.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Up the Creek"" comes with a theatrical trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a person who grew up with late '70s and '80s college romp films such as ""Animal House"", ""Porky's"", ""Private School"", ""Back to School"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"" are among the titles that people tend to remember.

Comedies that feature a lot of beer, a lot of women and a lot of sex...and of course, the main attraction to a lot of guys back then...nudity.

""Up the Creek"" is a film I remember watching on cable back when I was in high school and remember wanting to watching this film primarily for actress Jennifer Runyon.  This was her first film that she had starred in before he appearance on ""Ghostbusters"" and becoming part of the cast of ""Charles in Charge"", but as a teenager, I was big fan and watched this film just for her.

So, here we are nearly 30-years-later since the film made its debut in theaters and watching ""Up the Creek"" once again.

Needless to say, the film is kitschy.  The whole premise of four bad students of one of the worst universities academically and the four being offered free diplomas if they win a rafting contest is ridiculous.

But still, '80s ""college romps"" were never meant to be deep films, they were films about characters partying, having fun and getting laid and these films were indeed the sign of the times.

And of course, there is the banality of the underdogs going against the athletes or tough guys (in this case of this film, it's the ""preps"") and one of the underdogs hooking up with the hot girl that dated a prep.

""Up the Creek"" is a film which one knows how it's going to end, but you just wonder how crazy or how much sex will be in this film.  In terms of craziness, well...aside from the character of Gonzer wanting to eat all the time and the main character Bob, having a dog named Chuck (who seems to be smarter than most of the guys on the Lepetomane team), you have a military school trying to sabotage the competition and preppies who try to cheat their way to the top.  So, in terms of overall craziness, ""Up the Creek"" was a little weak in that regard.

As for nudity, sure you see a lot of topless girls but when you watched films such as ""Porky's"", ""Private School"" and ""Animal House"", even the nudity is a bit subdued for this film.

While ""Up the Creek"" may be nostalgic for some... for those wondering if this was one of the good ""college romp"" films of the '80s, my answer would be ""no"".  Granted, I can imagine my teenage self saying ""yes, watch it for Jennifer Runyon"", watching it today, I felt that ""Up the Creek"" was too subdued in comedy and hijinks for an '80s ""college romp"".

Recommended only if you are a fan of the film, otherwise, you can find better ""college romp"" films out there!",1335571200,2,6338,4.675675675675675

420379,4,6302045916,"As I laid my old worn-out VHS copy of UP THE CREEK to rest a few years ago, it was a real treat to get this DVD release in hand. Like some other big companies, MGM has released this as a bare-bones release in the 'dvd-on-demand' mold. The menu is sparse with no scene selection (though there are directions telling viewers to use their forward/backward buttons to go back/ahead about 10 minutes per scene). UP THE CREEK itself is in widescreen, and looks as good as it's ever bound to look since I saw it in a theater back in April 1984. The audio is good and clear (80's tunes, dialogue & sound FX) and images are clear and quite sharp, making the outdoor scenes pleasing to watch. There is also a decent heavily-80's style trailer.",1326153600,5,733,4.397058823529412
420383,4,6302045916,"This is the FIRST DVD REVIEW since Amazon piles all the VHS reviews in the DVD review slot. At the time I wrote this review the movie was 3 days after its DVD release date.

I do want to inform everyone ordering this on DVD.

THE NEGATIVES (some are very minor)

The Movie is ""MGM ON-DEMAND"" which is where MGM make a copy using DVD-R media to make the movie themselves. Same thing as Columbias version of on demand disks. This is not a bad thing but it does make some minor differences when you love movies.

The DVD only takes up 4 gigs of space so you knowledgeable people know what that means. Sound quality for one.
The sound on this is in mono and only plays on my center speaker so you will need to make some adjustments or find a good stereo setting to use. Dukes of Hazzard series was one that bugs me when its in mono. At least make it so it plays on at least two speakers in mono!

It may not play in some players as stated in print on the back. It says it will play on ""play only"" devices and may not play back on PCs or some DVD players. It would NOT play at all on my Xbox 360 for example. But it does play on my PC no problem. It also played on two of my portable players.
But don't assume it won't play for you. I wouldnt want to scare you :)

The printing on the disk is a standard MGM logo, some small print and the name ""UP THE CREEK"" in small lettering from a standard PC font. But at least its not a label stuck to the disk.

My wife gets mad when I ignore everything else when Heather Merriweather (Jennifer Runyon) is on the screen. Especially when she says that one line :)

I would say those last two negatives are very minor.

THE POSITIVES

At least its finally out for DVD release.

The video quality is pretty good on my Plasma 46 inch .of course you don't need hi definition video since its not known for its special effects :). Considering the source it the best they can do but I was still impressed how nice it looks. No pixelation as far as I could see. But I only watched 10 minutes so far.

It is in Widescreen which is nice since I never saw it in widescreen except on Netflix (weel the theater about 30 years ago :) ). I was glad since some companies make DVDs in full screen which is a waste and I was expecting a full screen to show up knowing some companies.

But I do give the movie 5 stars because it is funny all the way through. Better than Animal House and many of the others that came at that time. Except Porkys.
But I gave it 4 stars due to it being in mono and not playing on some players out there. 4 out of 5 players for me is not bad :)

Overall I did not mind spending 15 bucks to add this to my collection due to the fact I love the actual movie itself.

I hope this helps the people who just found out its available.",1325289600,26,2772,3.9873417721518987
420384,3,6302045916,"Up The Creek reunites Animal House stars Tim Matheson (Eric) and Stephen Furst (Dorfman) along with Pee-Wee (Dan Monahan) from the ""Porky's"" movies and a geek played by Sandy Helberg (You'd have seen him in something) who are all attending the worst college around. The opening scene is rather humorous as a lot of slap stick comedy is happening in the event of waking the 4 students up to meet with The Dean (John Hillerman - Magnum P.I) who informs them that the college has never won a thing in it's entire history, so he is sending them off to participate in a raft race against the other colleges, bribing them with degrees, but also hoping it might rid the misfits once and for all.

Once the 4 boys have reached the race events starting destination, they meet both the rival college, headed by Jeff East (Young Clark Kent in Superman and Pumkin Head) and his bunch of jock goons, and they also meet the leading lady of the movie (Jennifer Runyon - Ghostbusters) who was dating the lead jock, but now our main star has her in his arms, and that's what leads to the rivalry between our boys and the jock group of prats.

Also along the way is a bunch of side humor, almost Coyote and Roadrunner kind of humor, provided by the Military College that are ticked off about being disqualified from the event due to tampering and sabotage.

It's all a bit of a wacky ride to the finish line, and contains a fair bit of decent humor. Some of the raft battles with torpedoes and darts made me think this probably would have made a good video game. It's sort of like ""Wacky Races"" on water. However I can not agree with other reviewers, i'm sorry, but this is no where near as good as Animal House, Porkys, Screwballs or any of the other named classics of this kind. It's by far not bad, but there is a big reason it is not as popular, not as well known, and hasn't even been put on DVD yet. Hopefully someday it will, even if it's just a part of a pack of similar movies, but in no way does it compare to the others.

It was exciting to see this cast put together, and I think they all worked pretty well with each other, most gave a decent performance, but there is still a few actors that let the whole thing down, and a few things here and there that made me think ""was something cut out that would have made that part make sense"" or ""is it really that rushed? I mean I get it, but I don't know if it was meant to be that way or not""

See if for yourself to know what I am blabbing on about, and check it out if you loved Porkys and Animal House, but don't expect it to be better.",1315785600,,2580,4.204040404040404
420385,4,6302045916,"Enjoyed this simple movie about 3 college students that have been hand picked by their headmaster as the worst students in the country to bring back the one and only trophy for the school in exchange for any degree they want.  The 3 set out with no hope in even winning and arrive on site to immediately make enemies with the college boys that have made secret arrangements with the coordinator of the raft event to be a sure win.  There is also a side plot with the army students - they also hope to win and make plans to sabatoge the other rafts.  Of course there is also a battle to get the girls.  Well don't want to give away the whole movie, but the 3 ""losers"" perservere thru all the trials and setbacks of sabatoge, kidnapping, hazing, and a bomb to blow up the river and win the race.

Throughout the show there is a dog - which I personally think steals the show.  Just a fun enjoyable movie for a relaxing night with a bowl of popcorn. Glad I found this old classic.",1313712000,,991,4.222222222222222

The characters are funny and have their quirks about them, just interesting enough without over doing it. Your sides won't split watching this film, but all the elements together makes it work.

420392,3,6302045916,"I can only remember ""Up The Creek"" as being one of Tim Matheson's ""take-the-check-&-run"" jobs after portraying 60's ladies-man Eric ""Otter"" Straton in the smash ""Animal House"" when I caught this on late-nite AMC a few years back.  This was just fated to be forever lost in the shadows of ""Nerds"" and ""Porky's"" during those halcyon days of 80's slob comedies....an OK time-waster, but not much else to write home about.

On a more praising note, Cheap Trick's wacky, eponymous theme song (penned by the inimitable Doc Nielsen, possibly while ""high"" according to him during one 1997 interview!) hits a tidal-wave of a homer!  I recently picked up the Soundtrack after an near-exhaustive search on the web, and it was refreshing, exuberant ear candy to hear after 22 years!  Even though Robin, Rick, Bun E, & Tom have long reviled this tune (as well as the complementary weird video that's still seared in my mind) as a major skeleton from their 80's closet, consider me guilty as charged for wanting to have this single in my Trickster collection for many, many moons.  Sure, ""Budokan"", ""Monster"", or ""Rockford"" it ain't...but it has all the zany heart my checkerboard chaps had then and especially now!!!",1167436800,3,1203,4.906403940886699

This movie is funnier than Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, Meatballs, CaddyShack or any of the other similar comedies of its time... and in essence captures the best of each of those movies into one place.  There are lots of fun characters and scenes... and best of all, in my opinion, some of the best funny dialog in a comedy.  Tim Matheson absolutely shines in this... its a shame this movie wasn't a smash and he wasn't able to play more roles like this.  McGraw (Matheson) delivers a classic line in this after the character Heather, played by Jennifer Runyon, says something to the effect of ""You wouldnt lie to me, would you?""... he retorts... ""Of course I'd lie to you, I'm a guy... but I'm not lying now..."".  That is still my alltime favorite line in a movie.  I think there is alot of clever/sarcastic wit and dialog like that throughout the movie... perhaps why not everyone got it... it was alot more than T & A and relied more on comic timing than nudity (though it featured a bit of that as well).  Many other movies were dirtier... this was simply funnier!  This NEEDS to be on DVD!!!!

420402,5,6302045916,"""Up The Creek"" was released in 1984 starring Tim Matheson and the rest of the gang from the earlier and even more popular comedy ""Animal House"", about a wild college fraternity. They're back in this hilarious film about a river raft race and rivalry between college fraternities- the stereotypical snobby jocks and the average joes/nerds. Tim Matheson stars as Bob, who leads a ragtag group of guys who overcome great obstacles to win the race at the end. The script is tacky and often so bad in its attempt to be funny- i.e. the dog that uses body language to communicate with the guys that one of their friends is being held captive by the enemy without any clothes, even using liver as Japanese for river, the silly and slapstick comedy among the army guys that are conveniently close enough to the river to blow things up, the Revenge Of The Nerds style rivalry between jocks and suite and tie yuppies with the casual, average guys and Tim Matheson and the leading girl who plays his love interest repeating the same lines each time they have sex: was it good for you as it was for me ? This film is one of those 80's comedies that were very popular and paved the way for later college/fraternity films, which surprisingly still made it through the 90's and even in our current times. If you remember the 80's (and you're probably in your 30's and 40's if you do) this film will take you back. It's enjoyable in a campy and goofy sort of way, along the lines of the more loved Caddy Shack, Revenge Of The Nerd movies and Weekend At Bernies. Highly enjoyable film if you're a fan of the 80's and their comedies. Everything smells of the 80's in this movie- the music, even an original song ""Up The Creek"" with its rock rhythm, the clothes. Remember those slutty Madonna skirts and tops and girls with puffy hair ? And guys wearing white suite and ties ala Miami Vice ? All of it is here. This type of B-budget comedy never made it as big as the ""Breakfast Club"" which was even considered serious or even as mainstream comedy as the National Lampoon series starring Chevy Chase as the Griswald family father. But as obscure as this comedy is it will be sure to make you laugh at least once or twice. Check it out.",1087430400,18,2215,4.444717444717445
