1925049,5,B0000DIJOW,"What can you say about the greatest pure wrestler and world champion of the modern era?  Three discs barely do the man justice, for most of his matches are instant classics.  SEE...his triumphant return to the NWA World title in a cage at Starrcade.  SEE...his formation of the Four Horsemen, the most lethal group of all time.  SEE...his showdowns for the title, from Magnum T. A. and Dusty Rhodes, to Nikita Koloff and Lex Luger, to Sting and Ronnie Garvin, to Ricky Steamboat and Terry Funk, to Vader and the Giant.  SEE...Ric Flair jump to the (then)WWF as the ""real"" world champion and systematically take out Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan, capping it off with the greatest Royal Rumble performance of all time.  SEE...his battles with Bret Hart, Curt Henning, and Randy Savage.  SEE...his return to WCW to fight the NWO and Hollywood Hogan.  SEE...the new commissioner of Raw, and the evolution of Evolution.

1925070,5,B0000DIJOW,"It can be said--without much argument--that Ric Flair is the greatest NWA/WCW World Champion of all time. And even though--as far as personal favorites go--I always considered Sting my favorite WCW wrestler, there's no denying that when it came to the total package: charisma, mic skills, in ring ability, and whatever other factors people consider when thinking about what makes a great wrestler; there were none finer than the Nature Boy.

The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection cherry picks just a few of the many highlights from the great man's career: the feuds with Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Barry Windham, and of course, Sting.

Although, if I had to be totally honest, as big a fan as I am of the Flair/Sting rivalry--the match WWE chose for this collection was hardly the greatest from those 2. Not bad mind you, but well short of some of the greatest Sting/Flair matches like 'Great American Bash 1990', 'Clash of the Champions 1988', or even a match that Flair and Sting had on free tv on Monday Nitro back in April of 1999.

But, that's only a minor quibble--and besides, the Sting/Flair portion of this collection contains one of Ric's greatest promos ever: Reeking of Sex Appeal.

Overall, if you're a fan of the Nature Boy--or of great wrestling in general--then the Flair/Steamboat or Flair vs. Windham matches alone make this DVD collection money well spent. Wooooo!

1925089,1,B0000DIJOW,Don't buy this DVD because Ric Flair is the most boring non-athletic pro wrestler in the history of wrestling. I had my eye on this dvd since it was released back in 2003. So i decided to give it a shot. Man was i ever misled this has to be the worst collection of wrestling matches to ever be released on any dvd. Ric Flair is absolutely terrible. I never understood why people would rank him as one of the all-time greats because he is not. Ric Flair talks a big game but he has very little substance or wrestling ability and his wrestling timing and IQ are terrible.

1925102,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is the first of 2 collections WWE Entertainment released on DVD on Ric Flair and in my eyes are both essential to anyone who is an wrestling enthusiast, historian, collector, or even a  Ric Flair fan. Here is the match breakdown on this set. Ratings out of 10:

Harley Race at Starcade 1983 (9/10) This match is an excellent cage match that Flair regains the NWA Championship for the second time I believe. The match has some downtime that may turn a newer wrestling fan off. But this is a match that I feel established Ric Flair as the man. You also receive the promos leading up to the match, where Race puts a $25,000 bounty on Flair!!!

""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes at Starcade 1985 (9/10) The DVD explains the tension between these two stars leading up to this classic encounter with the Horseman taking it to Dusty even injuring him. This match as a lot of emotions and this was the start of a series of great bouts Flair had with Rhodes.

Barry Windham at World Wide Wrestling 1/20/87 (10/10) This might be the most under-rated bout on the set and many people may point to this match as the weak link on here. Once you watch it, it is an execllent 45 minute match feauting Flair facing Windhan both in their primes and excuting moves so fluently.

Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat at Clash of the Champions VI and Wrestle War 1989 (both 10/10) - the one thing missing from this set is the Chi Town Rumble to complete the trilogy of classic bouts Steamboat and Flair put on in 1989 (You can get that bout on the Superstars of the 1980's DVD) but you will not be disappointed with either match.

Terry Funk at Clash of the Champions IX (8/10)- Flair shows you here that he can adapt to a different wrestling style in an ""I Quit"" match. This match though mostly brawling in entertaining and will keep you going. Though after watching so many great bouts early you get spoiled a little.

Royal Rumble 1992 (6/10) - This is monumental because Flair wins his first WWF Championship. But the Royal Rumble match itself was dull in my opinion. Personally if you were going to use a Flair match from early WWF era go with his first bout with Hogan, or with Randy Savage at Summerslam. Or even in losing efforts against Mr. Perfect, Bret Hart. Its nice to see a whole Royal Rumble match.

Sting at Clash of the Champions XXVII (7.5/10)- Flair and Sting put on many classic bouts and I understand that you want to kind of show Flair all over his career, but this match maybe the 3rd or 4th best match they put on. Would have preferred the Clash of the Champions I bout (which is on the Definitive Flair DVD) or the bout at Great American Bash 1990 where Sting cradles Flair for the title, but this was big for Flair to unify the belts and Hogan at Bash at the Beach.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley at Monday Night Raw 5/19/03 (7/10)- The match was solid but most of the gravy points come from the tribute which is on here.

Pete Sanchez in 3/1/1976 (match 3/10; historical significance 10/10) - Flair's debut match

There is some bonus material about a life altering plane crash, promos, and about being in the Four Horseman. While the DVD misses out on fueds with Magnum T.A., Nikita Koloff, and Lex Luger or some debate on some selections of matches there is plenty to choose from as a fan.",1248912000,3,3286,4.432835820895522
1925103,5,B0000DIJOW,"Naitch is the best.  Even in matches where his opponent is lacking, Flair delivers.  There isn't a match he's been in past or present that isn't worth seeing.  ultimaye is right.  Flair always captured you whether in interviews or getting tossed off the ""top floor"", Slic Ric gives you all your money's worth. Absolutely the best DVD WWE has produced.  I want more Flair, Vince.  Anothre Flair DVD would be outstanding just cause his mug is on it.",1243728000,2,447,4.666666666666667
1925104,5,B0000DIJOW,"What else can you say about Ric Flair that hasn't already been said. The man is truly a Legend in the business. And to many of the fans out there and the wrestlers today, Ric Flair is the greatest of all time.

I reviewed The Definitive Collection a couple of days ago so why not review The Ultimate Collection. As far as match wise, this set holds that right. While the Definitive Collection has a few, rare, & good matches from Flair's past. The Ultimate Collection contains a lot of Flairs best & most famous matches from the beginning of his career all the way up to 2003. The matches (which includes most of the promos leading into them & postmatch interviews) includes Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Harley Race, Barry Windham, Terry Funk, Sting, & Triple H. Ric will go through each disc & comment on the best aspects from his career & then go directly into the match. All of the matches are in their entirety. Not only are the matches great, but the bonus material is great too which includes 4 extra matches with one being Ric's inring debut match.

Starrcade '83
Steel Cage Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Harley Race
This is the match that Flair regained his World Heavyweight title. Race & Flair used the cage pretty good. Both gets bloody. Possibably their best match against one another in their careers. 5/5

Starrcade '85
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Dusty Rhodes
Huge match. One of the bests in not only Flair's career but in Dusty's as well. Dusty works on the leg of Flair's for quite some time. The Horsemen would interfere. Still a tremendous match though. Their cage match from the Great American Bash '86 is very awesome too which is on Dusty's set. 5/5

NWA World Heavyweight Championship 1.20.87
Vs. Barry Windham
This match actually took place on free television & went to a TV time limit draw. It was a good back & forth contest. Windham gave Flair a lot of furry shots. This was a pretty good contest here. 4.5/5

Clash of the Champions VI
2 out of 3 Falls for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat
This was the second of three classic matches from Flair & Steamboat that took place in '89. In my view this was the most grueling match of the three. Steamboat takes a lot of severe punishment to his knee. The match went to a hour draw which would set up the rubber match at WrestleWar '89. 5/5

WrestleWar '89
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat
Not the best out of their series but still good nevertheless. Flair regains his title from the Dragon. And also renews his rivalry with Terry Funk here. 5/5

Clash of the Champions IX
I Quit Match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Terry Funk
Flair's famous I Quit match with Terry Funk from Troy, NY. It isn't as hardcore as you think with blood & all kinds of weaponuse. It was just more of an all out brawl. Flair makes Funk say I Quit with his signature figure 4 leg lock. 4.75/5

Royal Rumble '92
30 Man Royal Rumble Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship
The first & only Rumble match which the WWE title was up for grabs. Flair makes history here lasting for one hour after entering at number 3. Flair has a great showing in this match against the likes of the Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, British Bulldog, Shawn Michaels, Roddy Piper, Randy Savage, & others. 5/5

Clash of the Champions XXVII
Unification Match for the WCW Heavyweight Championship
Vs. Sting
At the time Sting was the WCW champion & Flair was the World International champion. Not nearly as good as their battle from the first Clash of the Champions. But is entertaiing & good to watch. 4.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship RAW 5.19.03
Vs. Triple H
Flair's last go around in his attempt to capture the World title for a 17th time. The match was very good. Jim Ross was all for Flair & being totally unbias to Triple H. Very good match. The postmatch celebration tribute to Flair after the cameras goes off the air is also shown in full. 4/5

Overall I strongly recommend getting this. But if you're looking for a strong documentary on Ric Flair then I suggest getting the Definitive Collection and/or the Four Horsemen set along with this. But this is surely worth the purchase in any case.",1230595200,2,4246,4.595772787318362
1925105,5,B0000DIJOW,"The matches and bonuses on this release has already been covered by other reviewers so I'll give you the overview. Released in 2003, this release on Ric Flair is mostly matches along with the promos and events that led up to them. The matches are:

Vs. Harley Race - His famous Starrcade '83 cage match where he regained the NWA World Title for the second time.

Vs. Dusty Rhodes - His Starrcade '85: The Gathering bout. Highly recommended not only for the match but the promos and events that led up to it!

Vs. Ricky Steamboat - You get not one but two of his best matches against Steamboat. The two out of three falls bout from New Orleans and his WrestleWar '89: Music City Showdown match where Flair regained the NWA Title for the sixth time. This also has the match that saw Steamboat return to challenge Flair for the title prior to both of those bouts.

Vs. Barry Windham - This match was actually on free TV on the old NWA World Wide Wrestling.

Vs. Terry Funk - Their famous ""I Quit"" match from 1989 in Troy, NY.

Vs. Sting - This bout was from 1994 where Flair became the undisputed WCW World Champion.

The Royal Rumble 1992 - Flair made history by lasting nearly one hour to win the Rumble match and win the WWF/WWE title in the process.

Vs. HHH - Their famous Greenville, SC match from 2003 which also saw Flair get an impromptu celebration after the cameras went off the air.

My overall recommendation is to get this along with two other releases. They are Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen as well as Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection. Between those three releases, you will have a great idea of who Ric Flair was and what he was about. I might also recommend Heroes Of World Class & WWE's The Triumph And Tragedy Of World Class Championship Wrestling. Though the latter two are mainly on the Von Erich family, Ric Flair is a big part of their story too.

Anyway, on its own, it is still a good piece of history to own of one of the best sports entertainers ever!",1223510400,2,1980,4.370572207084469
1925106,2,B0000DIJOW,"I will admit the wrestling footage is full & complete; my expectations were high on this. Maybe a more personal Flair; the plane accident was very lightly touched(7 Minutes).

Ric Flair still proves to be at the top of his game still wowing audiences with his skills and ""woooing"" crowds with his charisma, even though if you're not a fan of Flair or just a new fan you've gotta check this out.  I know that there are some critics that ""hated"" it or just didn't get it, but just give it another look, maybe you'll have a change of heart.  But like I said ealier, I enjoyed it and hope that you will too.  And as Ric Flair would say:""...If you like it or don't like it, learn to love it.""  ;)",1204156800,,714,3.896551724137931

1. Rick Flair vs HARLEY RACE (Starrcade. November-24, 1983): This was a Steel Cage Match for Race's NWA World HeavyWeight Title, and an attempt at a rather elaborate Flair entrance is shown in full. Special Guest Referee (& former World Champion) Gene Kinisky calls for the bell & Flair has the better of a rather methodically paced first 5 minutes or so. Race eventually takes control though & targets Ric's neck with moves such as a piledriver, a swinging neckbreaker & many throws into the steel cage (which predictably busts Flair open). Flair gets revenge by opening a wound on Race's forehead soon after, as The Nature Boy doubles his intensity.

A Figure 4 Leglock gets the crowd right into it, but Race escapes & is able to put together many minutes of offense to weaken Flair. But Ric eventually fights back with a flurry of offense & an interesting looking top-rope cross body-block for the pinfall at the 24 minute mark! This bout will hardly have modern-day fans on the edge of their seat, but it was solid & sufficiently put together & performed. It told a good story & was rather intense, although I thought the brutality factor could have been taken up a notch. 24 minutes was about the correct duration for these 2 & while the action was not exactly fast-paced, it wasn't boring either. Match Rating...7.5

2, Rick Flair vs DUSTY RHODES (Starrcade. November-28, 1985): This match was for Flair's NWA World HeavyWeight Title, and while there were some cheers for him, Flair was predominantly booed here. Rhodes gets the better of a chop & punch-fest that begins the bout, and Flair takes a couple of time-outs to get his mind back on the job. A kick to the ankle area of Rhodes evens the bout up a little, but it is still Dusty in control as he gains revenge by targeting Ric's ankle. Many minutes of back & forth action follows, but it is Rhodes who seemingly always has the answers, as Flair struggles with his sore ankle. But when Dusty lands awkwardly & re-injures his ankle, Flair goes to work & constantly tries to apply his patented Figure 4 Leglock.

Following some brawling at ringside, the face challenger regains control in the ring, as the pace starts to quicken. That is, until Rhodes misses a kick & ends up further hurting his ankle up against the ring-ropes. Flair subsequently takes over & finally applies the Figure 4, but Dusty won't quit & somehow fights back to even up the match. A ref bump then follows, which predictably leads to interference from The Andersons. With the arrival of a new referee, Rhodes kicks out of a pinfall attempt & rolls Flair up for the win at the 22 minute mark. Another very solid bout that isn't anything too special, but is well-performed & told a good story (despite some arguably dodgy selling). I was glad that the bout was kept at 22 minutes & I couldn't say that the match ever got boring. Please note that the result of the match was later inexplicably reversed to a DQ win to Dusty Rhodes. Match Rating...7.5

3. Rick Flair vs BARRY WINDHAM (January-13, 1987): Emanating from Columbia - South Carolina, this is practically a Lumberjack Match, despite not officially being so. Dusty Rhodes & the Rock `N' Roll Express negate the ringside presence of The 4 Horsemen. Starts frenetically with the crowd very much into it & cheering on the face Windham. Flair risks disqualification (with chokes & low-blows) to get control of the bout, but it is Windham's energy that continues to regain the momentum. The challenger even locks in the Figure 4 Leglock, but it's broken up by interference from JJ Dillon.

Despite another low-blow of sorts, Windham continues to run Flair ragged & even hits a missile dropkick from the top-rope. But following a huge lariat from the challenger, the bout breaks down into an 8 man melee as Windham officially wins by DQ at the 7 minute mark. Too short to amount to anything special, but the non-stop pace & entertainment value of this match was difficult to ignore. Excellent set-up bout for something bigger & longer. Match Rating...7.5

4. Rick Flair vs BARRY WINDHAM (World Wide Wrestling. January-20, 1987): Taking place exactly a week after Windham's DQ win, this match was for Flair's NWA World HeavyWeight Title. Windham attempts to begin at a frenetic pace, but Flair successfully keeps the action grounded, where both men hold their own. Windham surprisingly uses many headlocks in an attempt to weaken Ric, but each time Flair fights out, the challenger has no trouble in upping the pace with a flurry of offense. Nothing amounts from it initially though, as Flair masterfully takes time-out at ringside following most of Windham's flurries.

We come back from a mid-match commercial break with Windham in control with a head-scissors. But the champ eventually takes the action to ringside, where his greater experience regains control. Back in the ring, Flair targets the challengers arm with a couple of submission holds. Windham fights out though & the bout soon turns into a brawl with both wrestlers getting in their fair share of haymakers. We come back from another commercial break with more of the same, until a battle of suplexes leads to Flair locking in the Figure 4. Windham escapes though & subsequently earns a few 2 counts as he quickens the pace despite looking very tired. The challenger then locks on the Figure 4 himself in order to get the victory, but Flair reaches the ropes & attempts to start a comeback as we head to yet another commercial break.

Back to the brawling we go, until Windham locks on an abdominal stretch. But a ref bump follows that sees Flair escape the hold successfully. The challenger then hits a top-rope missile dropkick, before locking in a sleeper-hold with only 4 minutes remaining in the (time limited) bout. What follows is Windham hitting Flair with everything but the kitchen sink & getting nearfall after nearfall. The match then ends in a time limit draw just after Windham hits Flair with his flying lariat finisher. We see 31 minutes of action (excluding commercial time) & it is terrific action at that. The bout did begin a little disappointingly with Windham employing far too many restholds & any spurt of action ending prematurely. But apart from some questionable brawling at times, the final half of the bout is tremendously involving & entertaining with both men to be praised for their efforts. Judging by this, Windham was indeed a potential World Champion. Match Rating...9

Disk 2

5. RIC FLAIR & BARRY WINDHAM vs RICKY STEAMBOAT & EDDIE GILBERT (NWA World Championship Wrestling. January-21, 1989): Steamboat returns to the NWA in this match as a mystery partner for Gilbert. And check out a very young Teddy Long as the referee! Steamboat begins at an excellent pace with his patented deep armdrags & running the ropes. But he also shows his strength during this stage, truly showing his versatility. Ricky genuinely dominates the first 5 minutes & then Gilbert continues the momentum for the faces. At this point, the DVD is clearly edited & it resumes with the heels in control, but Gilbert about to make the hot tag to Steamboat. More fast-paced action ensues with Steamboat totally in control & finishing off Flair with a top-rope Cross Body-Block. I'm actually not going to rate this bout as the edit was clearly there to only show Flair vs Steamboat & who knows how good or bad the middle section was. But the 7 minutes we did see was very frenetic & entertaining, even if it was all Ricky The Dragon! Deserving of a place on this DVD. Match Rating 8/10.

6. Rick Flair vs RICKY STEAMBOAT (Clash Of The Champions 6. April-2, 1989): This is a `best of 3 falls' match emanating from The SuperDome in New Orleans & was for Steamboat's World HeavyWeight Title. Terry Funk provides special comments for this bout, which begins rather methodically with both men trying to get into the head of their opponent. Some decent mat-wrestling is showcased & the 2 thankfully keep the intensity up, in what is obviously setting up a longer than usual match. The first 20 or so minutes is clearly not without a few restholds, but the action is sufficiently intense & physical, while there are enough near-falls & good storytelling to make it all work sufficiently. The first fall goes to Flair after he reverses a small package at the 20 minute mark.

What was missing from the first fall was some of Steamboat's fast-paced, high-flying action & it didn't take too long for him to turn it up a few gears to begin the 2nd fall. The Dragon then retains control by pounding away at Flair's knee & then hooking in the Figure 4 Leglock. Flair escapes, but then finds himself in a Boston Crab, further weakening him. The Nature Boy gets back into the bout by taking the action to the outside where his heel ways help him regain control. Back in the ring, Flair cleverly uses an abdominal stretch to gain numerous 2 counts, but Steamboat fights back with a Superplex & then goes to work on Ric's back with many blows. He then locks on a painful looking double chicken-wing for the submission to equal the bout at the 35 minute mark!

Flair begins the final fall by focusing on the legs of the champ by any means necessary. It's all a set-up for the Figure 4 which he hooks on at the 41 minute mark right in the center of the ring. The Dragon finally escapes the hold, but clearly favors the leg when trying to put together a subsequent flurry of offense. Both men get 2 counts from top-rope cross body-blocks, as the pace begins to pick up. But Flair logically slows it down with a sleeper-hold, which predictably gets the crowd involved. Ricky does escape, but gets brutalized by the challenger who once more goes to work on the weakened leg. Following a flurry of intense chops & strikes by Steamboat, he locks on the double chicken-wing once more. But his leg buckles under him & both men appear to have their shoulders pinned to the mat with a leg under the ropes. The referee counts to 3 & awards the bout to Steamboat at the 55 minute mark in a clearly controversial finish!

Terrific match which has many things in common with the Hart vs Michaels Iron Man Match from WrestleMania 12. So if you liked or disliked that 1996 match, you will most probably view this similarly. Great effort from both men in this rather natural & competitive bout, especially Steamboat who sells everything well & portrays his mental & physical tiredness perfectly. To be critical, Flair doesn't sell quite as well & the match could have had a little more action in the first fall. But that's being picky & overall, this is enthralling & entertaining action & drama that is great viewing. It's always difficult to rate such a lengthy bout (as they are so difficult to pull off). My initial thought was a 9, but I really liked the way the controversial ending was pulled off, so I'll go with a..... Match Rating...9.5

7. Rick Flair vs RICKY STEAMBOAT (WrestleWar. May-7, 1989): Three judges sat at ringside just in case this 1 fall bout went to a 60 minute time limit draw. A nice mix of everything is included in the first 10 minutes or so with Steamboat getting the better of the offense & predictably working on Flair's arm (presumably setting up for the double chicken-wing submission hold). There are some flashes of Ricky's pace & aerial skills during this time, but it's not as much as I would have hoped for. What The Dragon does do very well is up the intensity with each time that Flair begins to fight back. Both wrestlers do a great job of telling the story that the face champ has an answer for everything the heel challenger throws at him, whether in the ring or at ringside. The tide changes after Steamboat misses a cross body-block & Flair gets many nearfalls following minutes on end of The Nature Boy delivering some solid, if unspectacular, offense.

A few bone-crunching moves to ringside at about the 25 minute mark really lifts the pace, as both men earn nearfalls. A Superplex by the champ sets up a failed chicken-wing attempt, but then he subsequently takes a huge fall to the outside when perched on the top-rope. This leads to a leg injury which Flair predictably targets & locks on the Figure 4 Leglock. Ricky escapes, but continues to be the target of an attack towards his leg. That is, until he hits a desperation enziguri to seemingly halt Flair's momentum. The finish comes soon after at the 32 minute mark though when Steamboat attempts a body slam, but Flair holds on to his leg & rolls through for the pinfall.

Afterwards, Jim Ross interviews Flair in the ring where he puts over Steamboat (despite being a heel at the time), but then gets challenged & attacked by (judge) Terry Funk. This includes a very awkward looking piledriver on a table! Definitely not the greatest match ever. In fact, I prefer both of the 2 other matches that I have seen between these 2. That's not to take too much away from this bout though, as it's still rather entertaining, tells a good story & is a solid mix of everything. But to me, this match lacked something to make it a classic. It's difficult to put my finger on it, but something was definitely missing. Match Rating...8.5

8. Rick Flair vs TERRY FUNK (Clash Of The Champions 9. November-15, 1989): This is an ""I Quit"" Match & it should be noted that it is a non-title bout! Flair does a good job in transitioning his intensity to his face character to begin the match. He also chops Funk outside of the ring a few times, and Terry does a great job in playing crazy by attacking the crowd & a cameraman. Both men ambitiously head for the microphone in the first 10 minutes, as both wrestlers take turns in punching or chopping their opponent constantly. Funk hits a piledriver on Flair in the ring & then follows up with another on the concrete at ringside! Flair doesn't quit though & he even fights back with some genuinely intense offense around ringside.

Back in the ring, Flair goes to work on Funk's left knee, while also throwing in the occasional loud chop to the chest. While Funk fights out of an initial attempt to lock on the Figure 4 Leglock, he can't get out of it the second time & eventually quits after being locked in the move for over a minute. A little short at just 18 minutes in length, this bout still did have a fair bit of action, while also being rather entertaining. I'm unsure if it was because he was playing the face, but Flair did a great job in acting out his intensity, while Funk's crazy character fit in well with that. I wouldn't put this anywhere near the upper echelon of greatest matches ever, but it's still very good. Match Rating...9

Disk 3

9. 1992 ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH: Just as a quick history lesson & introduction to this match, the WWF Championship was declared vacant in late 1991 after a controversial finish to the Hulk Hogan vs Undertaker title match from The Survivor Series ppv. Basically, all sorts of interference resulted in a `Taker victory & the WWF President of the time (Jack Tunney) ruled the title vacant because of this. It was then decided that the winner of the Royal Rumble Battle Royal match would become the WWF Champion. It should also be noted that Flair's advisor Bobby `The Brain' Hennan co-commentated the match with Gorilla Monsoon.

`The British Bulldog' DaveyBoy Smith & `The Million Dollar Man' Ted Dibiase draw numbers 1 & 2, and after some decent back & forth action, DaveyBoy eliminates Dibiase at about the 90 second mark. Flair then unpredictably enters at #3, much to Heenan's chagrin. Fortunately for The Nature Boy, a few heels enter in succession afterwards & do some of Ric's dirty work for him. Other notable top 10 entrants include Shawn Michaels & `The Texas Tornado' Kerry Von Erich, who both add some energy to the bout. A bit of a quiet spell follows, but it all picks up again at the 24 minute mark when Flair eliminates The Bulldog & Von Erich. A further succession of eliminations sees Flair left in the ring with The Big Bossman, who he promptly gets rid of. This is all a set-up for entrant #15, who just happens to be... the InterContinental Champion `Rowdy' Roddy Piper! After some intense action between the 2, Flair is put to sleep by Piper, but is saved by Jake `The Snake' Roberts.

Many of the big names are left towards the end with The Undertaker entering at #20, `Macho Man' Randy Savage at #21, Hulk Hogan at #26, Sgt Slaughter at #28 & Sid Vicious at #29. Hogan eliminates `Taker & then Sid cleans house making multiple eliminations leaving the final 4 as Savage, Sid, Hogan & Flair. Savage is promptly thrown over the top-rope before the 2 faces take turns in beating on Flair. But Sid can't resist the opportunity of dumping Hogan out from behind, and while the 2 argue about it, Flair sneaks up & eliminates Sid to win the match & title at the 62 minute mark. Terrific stuff! This is widely acknowledged as the best ever Rumble match due to the star-power involved & the prize at the end of it. I can't rate it perfectly due to a couple of flat spots & the lack of entrance themes, but Heenan's sensational commentary almost makes up for that! Well booked... Well performed... Entertaining & memorable! Match Rating...9.5

10.  Rick Flair vs STING (Clash Of The Champions 27. June-23, 1994): This match which emanated from Charleston-South Carolina is a title unification bout between the World HeavyWeight Title & the World International Title. Sting practically dominates the opening 6 minutes, having an answer for everything that Flair throws at him. Furthermore, the Stinger seems to be in The Nature Buys mind, as Flair clearly looks rattled in stalling, jaw-jacking with the crowd & even pushing the referee. A missed Stinger Splash opens the door ajar for Flair & he wastes no time in getting Sting to ringside & showing his true heel colors. Back in the ring, Flair goes to work on his opponent, but the offense is a little all over the place & doesn't concentrate on a body part in typical Flair fashion.

A sleeper-hold provides both wrestlers with a break, before a tired looking Sting attempts a comeback, while also picking up the pace a little. A nice superplex gets Flair hurt, but a missed top-rope splash doesn't allow Sting to finish the match off. Sting proceeds to no-sell a vertical suplex & unleash his usual flurry of offense, but it all comes to a screeching halt when he accidentally cross body-blocks Sensational Sherri at ringside. In the ensuing mayhem, he goes to check on her & gets rolled up by Flair for the pinfall at the 17 minute mark. Sherri very predictably turns on Sting afterwards & the debuting Hulk Hogan eventually makes the save.

Rather disjointed match that always gave me the impression that it was going nowhere. It began well enough, but it was the type of opening that was more suited to a 30+ minute match, not one that only lasted 17 minutes. After that, this lacked direction for the most part & what direction it had (cheap & premature ending, Sherri's role, ordinary psychology for the most part) was a letdown. It was entertaining enough though & fairly well performed to some extent. But overall, this disappointed me. Match Rating...8

11.  Rick Flair vs PETE SANCHEZ (March-1, 1976): This match that emanated from Madison Square Garden is Flair's WWWF debut. Flair had his Nature Boy nickname, his patented robe & didn't look much different than what he did some 6 or 7 years later in the NWA. Sanchez, playing the face, spends the first few minutes attempting to gain a submission with a variety of arm-bar maneuvers. Some underhanded tactics get Flair back into the match & he replies with an arm-bar of his own. Sanchez eventually fires up & gets the otherwise silent crowd involved. The match picks up from there & is very even with both men getting in some half-decent offense. Flair then wins the bout from a standard suplex at the 10 minute mark. It's always handy to see a super early match from any wrestler & I suppose this is no exception as we see what has changed & what has remained in Flair's wrestling. Fairly boring otherwise, but not so terrible that it is unwatchable. Probably a little over-long with too many arm holds at the beginning. Match Rating...5.5

12.  Rick Flair vs TRIPLE H (Raw. May-19, 1993): Emanating from Greenville South Carolina, this match was for Triple H's World HeavyWeight Title. At the time, Flair & H were partners in the Evolution stable, but were matched up here when Triple H was forced to defend his title after sustaining rib injuries at the hands of Kevin Nash at a recent ppv. H chose Flair believing that he would lay down for him, but The Nature Boy was eager to wear gold around his waist once more. Flair is quick to get the live crowd on side, with a couple of cheap shots, a couple of chops, some targeting of the injured ribs & a couple of ""wooooos"". He even steps up the wrestling with some suplexes & a top-rope ax-handle that actually connects. Flair then targets the leg of the champion & the crowd goes absolutely crazy as he locks on the Figure 4 Leglock. Triple H reaches the ropes though & lives to fight another day.

A referee bump follows & Triple H heads for the World Title, but falls victim to an eye-poke, low-blow & title shot to the head, all of which results in a super close 2 count that almost has the crowd rushing the ring! Flair then counters a Pedigree attempt with a back body-drop & looks to lock on a Pedigree of his own. But the champ counters & finally connects with his finisher for the pinfall at a little longer than 7 minutes. Tremendously exciting bout with most fans (both live in attendance & at home) genuinely thinking that Flair could pull off a surprise title win. Terrifically booked with hardly a moment of wasted time or energy, while the performances of both men were spot on. Tough to rate due to the short duration, but that sort of worked in its favor as well, even though an extra 2-3 minutes wouldn't have hurt it too much. Entertaining stuff. Match Rating...8.5

Well that raps up another. I would give Rick Flairs Dvd review a grade of 98/130 which is a 76% which means this is a perfect dvd. I thnk that is a good sum up a really soild vdd and a must pick up for any flari fan. If u can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that.

1925114,4,B0000DIJOW,"In a span of nearly four decades has no wrestler ever captivated the imagination of so many wrestling fans around the world...and I would even include HOGAN, RHODES, THESZ, AND SAMMARTINO to this small list...but FLAIR is the man!!! I bought this DVD and was quite surprised that WWE left off several key matches in his career...some matches that in one way or another ignited other memberable storylines,ie. THE VON ERICH/ FREEBIRD feud at REUNION STAR WARZ 1982 in which FLAIR and KERRY wrestled for the National Wrestling Alliance World Title and MICHAEL HAYES was the guest referee, in which Terry Gordy slams the cage door on Kerry's head..nor was the 1984 PARADE OF CHAMPIONS MEMORIAL TO DAVID VON ERICH in which Kerry captures the NWA title,(at that time the largest crowd to watch a match 48,000 fans at TEXAS STADIUM) Nevertheless, this DVD is just pure adrenaline...and every fan that pays a ticket to any of his matches know they are going to get every thing out of him. Whether you booed the hell out of him or cried with him when he gave so many emotional interviews be it ""shoot"" or script you have to respect him...and being a fan from Dallas, Texas I always rooted for him when he came through town...even against the home town VON ERICHS...The one thing I hate that Vince Mc Mahon did not give him a platform to at least compete for a world title match this year to celebrate his 25TH ANNIVERSARY of winning his first ""world"" title September 17, 1981. The extras and promos are classic and timeless. I like the way he would egg the crowd on..and holla out, ""You shut your mouth fat-bot...""...you keep that up honey,and I'll take you home and make a real woman out of you...and his rants about being Secratariat in disguise...just totally funny...and that's what you need to be a good professional wrestler, you have to know how to move the crowd and cause a stir....I think when he finally retires the boots, there will be a lineage and legacy that will retire with him as well...If you're a wrestling purist this DVD is for you...if you want a little history of the business and classic matches this is the one also a great buy.....",1159747200,3,2150,4.630890052356021
1925115,5,B0000DIJOW,"The living legend Ric Flair is represented very well here on 3 DVD's that highlight his career from AWA to present. I'm also reading Ric's book and for the price I picked it up used it's a GREAT purchase to go along with this set. I'm enjoying this DVD set and can highly recommend it to his fans.

Below is the reason why I got this DVD, and my brief personal meeting with The Nature Boy. I stand by those words and I'm now one of his biggest fans, as a Wrestler and as a Celebrity. Wooooooooo!!!!

Am I into wrestling?, well no. Have I watched it before?, yes many times, often when getting pretty drunk buzzed and I find it very entertaining at times (when I have not seen it for a while). Did I like Ric Flair when I would watch him, I don't think so, he was the cheater so I always went for the ""good"" guy like the Hulkster (you had to love his character (Flair's) before the match though, The Nature Boy would crack me up). But let me tell you why I really like Ric Flair now. In the late fall of 2004 Ric Flair came to the Middle East along with some other wrestlers (David Benoit, and some wrestling babes), and did a signing and picture event for the troops at the base I was at. I had JUST got back from Iraq (the base he came to and I was at than was in Qatar, not a shooting zone like Iraq), and fortunately we were allowed 2 beers a day there. Before the signing, Ric really said some stuff that impressed me, calling out the lefties in this country that would sacrifice the efforts being made in the Middle East to gain politically, he called it like it was and is! Well, after the pics (which I've got a great one with Ric),
Ric and David hung out for some beers and amazingly most of the crowed had left and I got to hang out with these guys! They were really down to earth and I really got the sense that they were fully supportive of the troops, not like the crap you hear from these protestors that ""support"" the troops but hate the mission. Well, that's my real memory of Ric Flair and he's #1 in my book from now on! Just like Ann Margaret is loved by thousands of Vietnam War Vets, Ric Flair I'm sure gained some followers who are Iraqi Freedom Vets like me. Wooooooo!",1154217600,3,2190,4.126463700234192

ONE OF THE EXTRAS IS FLAIR ADRESS THE CROWED ON THE LAST WCW NITRO AND THE BEST EXTRA IS RIC FLAIR VS HHH FROM RAW 2003!!! ALSO IT HAS MORE GREAT MATCHES AND EXTRAS.

1925128,5,B0000DIJOW,"""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair will go down as one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of this business.  There's nothing else I can say about Ric Flair that hasn't already been said about him so let's just skip to the review.

The way this DVD is structured is to have chapters on some of his classic feuds throughout his career. During each chapter, they'll have Flair comment on the feud and have his favorite match from that feud while the bonus features are interviews & recaps of incidents.

Harley Race:  Steel Cage Match from Starrcade '83 where Flair wins the NWA Title for the second time.
DVD extras for this include Race putting a bounty on Flair, Dick Slater & Bob Orton Jr. collecting it & injuring Flair's neck, Flair retiring because of the injury, Flair returning to get revenge on Orton & Slater, the press conference for the Race/Flair match, and all the pre & post match promos from Starrcade.
A classic encounter, don't know what else to say here.

Dusty Rhodes from Starrcade '85 where Rhodes wins the title in a controversial ending.
DVD extras here include footage of Rhodes having his ankle broken by Flair & the Andersons, promos by Flair & Rhodes including Dusty's famous ""Hard Times"" promo, and refere Tommy Young explaining the controversy surrounding the match causing Dusty to return the championship to Flair.
Another classic match & my second favorite match after their cage match from the Bash '86

Barry Windham from NWA Main Event in Jan. 1987 that ended in an hour draw.
DVD extras here include a promo from Windham & his partner Ronnie Garvin with footage of Windham being attacked by the Horsemen, footage of an unscheduled match between Flair & Windham that involved the Horsemen & Rhodes & Rock N' Roll express, Dusty & Flair's post match comments.
This match just showcases why Windham is still an underrated wrestler to this day.  Lost classic here.

2 matches against Ricky Steamboat including the 2 out of 3 Falls match from the Clash Of The Champions VI & WrestleWar '89 where Flair regained the title.
DVD extras here include footage of Steamboat's return to the NWA in a tag match with Eddie Gilbert vs. Flair & Windham, Steamboat's workout against 3 wrestlers (including a very young Dustin Rhodes) before having a physical confrontation with Flair, Flair & Steamboat's confrontation at the Clash Of Champions V.  Also included are promos from Flair, Steamboat, WCW President Jim Herd, and Flair's attorney regarding the controversal ending to the Clash match along with the pre-match Flair promo from WrestleWar.
What can I say about these series of classic matches that haven't already been said for years.  The WrestleWar match is one of greatest matches of all time.

Terry Funk (my personal favorite) in an ""I Quit"" match from Clash Of Champions IX
DVD extras here are the press conference for Flair's return after being injured by Funk at WrestleWar, Funk attacking Flair at the Clash Of Champions VIII & putting a plastic bag over his head, Funk & Flair promos regarding the ""handshake"" stipulation, another Flair promo, and two sets of pre match promos from Flair & Funk.
I love Terry Funk & this was one of his best matches in the series with Flair that was hardcore but filled with some comedic moments.  Classic Funk here.

Royal Rumble in 1992 where Flair entered #3, won the Rumble, and the World Championship
DVD extras are Bobby Heenan prepairing for Flair's debut, Flair's WWF debut on Prime Time Wrestling, two sets of Flair promos including one on the Funeral Parlor with Paul Bearer, Flair attacking Roddy Piper at the broadcast booth that saw Vince get hit with a chair in the process, and the post match promo where the World Title was presented to Flair.
One of the most entertaining Rumbles down to Bobby Heenan reacting to Flair's every move on commentary. Other highlights of this Rumble was Randy Savage getting his hands on Jake Roberts and the Hogan/Sid confrontation at the end.

Sting in a unification match from Clash of the Champions XXVII where Flair unified the WCW International & WCW World Championship.
DVD extras here include the segment from Clash of the Champions X where the Horsemen kick Sting out of the group, a promo regarding Flair's match with Sting from the first Clash, and Sting's pre-match promo.
This was the weakest match on this set as instead of picking another classic encounter they had (the first Clash, Great American Bash '90, or even one of their matches from their 1995 fued), they picked the match that was more focued on Flair's upcoming feud with Hulk Hogan (just listen to the commentary) than the actual match with Sting itself.

Other highlights include his match with Triple H from RAW in May of '03 and the post-show tribute to Flair, his Madison Square Garden debut in '76, his speech from the last Nitro, and 2 Confidential stories regarding the ""original"" 4 Horsemen with stories from Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard. Hidden extras include Flair's titantron, WWE talent & staff doing a tribute to Flair's ""WHOOO!!!"", and 5 Flair promos. The only downside to this, besides the Sting match I mentioned earlier, is nothing is mentioned about Flair's second time in WCW & nothing is mentioned about Flair's time in WWE past the Royal Rumble but I guess there's always a chance for a volume two.

If your a fan of Flair's then your already going to get this but if are you aren't...then just look at it & you become a fan or at least gain more respect for the Nature Boy. Diamonds are forever & so is Ric Flair...WHOOO!!!!",1148688000,9,5535,4.7740585774058575
1925129,1,B0000DIJOW,"There are a lot of questions in this world that remain unanswered. Such as, why are we here, is there life after death and WHY THE HELL ISN'T RIC FLAIR DEAD YET!

Ric Flair completely stole his gimmick from the original ""nature boy"" Buddy Rogers and he is a routine wrestler if I ever saw one. All of his matches contain exactly the same routine, which consists of a chop, being thrown from the top rope, low blow, ball grabbing, bleeding and the figure four-leg lock. Also, man is this guy slow, he's so slow he makes Oscar night look relatively short.

I can't believe this senile old fool actually believes he is the greatest wrestler of all time. I would actually put him in second place on the all time list with everybody else at number one and triple h at number three. The only reason he isn't washed up and lying in the gutter with all the other WCW retards is that he's kissing some much ass backstage at the WWE. Ric Flair is a 16-time world champion, but even Viscera could of won 16 world championships if he had bookers for friends.

Is it me or is anyone else sick of seeing his saggy man breasts on television. Please someone buy the man a sports bra. I am praying for the day that someone takes this old fool out to the barn and puts him down because I am sick and tired of seeing this limousine riding, jet flying piece of CRAP!

By the way, I was really disappointed with this DVD and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a pulse.",1143331200,9,1451,4.265454545454546
1925130,1,B0000DIJOW,"What do we do

When first started watching wrestling in my early teens, Ric Flair was a hero of mine, he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever.

So when this DVD came out I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All the matches are the same, there long and dull, the same moves are done over and over, and the matches only pick up when Flair opponent takes the advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches, if that are done well, like the Iron man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long, so it can show Flairs endurance.

I also noticed Flair is so repetitive, all wrestler use trademark moves, but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life, for example, chop...woo...flair flop...figure four...cheat....win, that not a description of one flair match, that's every flair match. When I started watching wrestling I only saw his WWF matches, so it all looked new to me, when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are. Other wrestler have put together DVD, which shows a variety of different matches such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart & Shawn Michaels, all top wrestler adopt to there opponents, Flair expects his opponents to adopt to him, that's way all his matches are the same.

The only thing worst then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for Flair after a read his book, it seem that he is just like HHH and Shawn Michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face, put does it behind their backs. He bashes Mick Foley for being a stunt man, who only does gimmick matches, so what's HHH, a guy flair calls great, can anyone name a good HHH match that isn't a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight). He says Foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player, who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles. He critises Bret Hart for not putting over Shawn Michaels at Survivors Series 97, when he was called upon to job to Lex Luger before he left who the WWF. he refused and took the title with him to WWF, brining the WCW to its knees.

After watching this DVD, reading his book, and seeing how his using backstage politics at the WWE now, to keep himself in the limelight, its fair to say the Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way I could have won 16 world title if I had my friends booking the show

1925131,5,B0000DIJOW,"Ric Flair IS the greatest of all time. There will NEVER be another performer like this man, and this DVD shows exactly why. This is possibly the most AWESOME DVD ever released by the WWE and it will likely stay that way until the WWE releases a Bret Hart DVD. But onto this DVD. It's AWESOME like I said before. Here's my review:

Disc One

vs. Harley Race, Starrcade 83 (This excellent match is of much of slower pace than today's type matches, but it's worth a look. Flair winning the NWA Title is one of the special moments in pro wrestling history.) *****

vs. Dusty Rhodes, Starrcade 85 (Not a classic in the technical wrestling sense, but give it a look ONLY if you've never seen it before. Flair & Rhodes had an extensive series of matches in the 80s.) **1/2

vs. Barry Windham, Worldwide 87 (This AWESOME match got the ENTIRE Worldwide show in 87, and if not for the Savage vs. Steamboat match at Wrestlemania III, this would've been the match of the year for 97. A definite classic.)*****

Disc Two

vs. Ricky Steamboat, Clash Of The Champions VI, 2/3 Falls (The second big match for these two athletes. Classic, classic, classic, this one IS breathtaking.)*****

vs Ricky Steamboat, WrestleWar 89 (Another classic with Steamboat where Flair wins the NWA title for the 6th time. They had the greatest series of matches EVER in 1989)*****

vs. Terry Funk, Clash Of The Champions IX, I-Quit match (One of the first true matches to embrace the hardcore stipulation before ECW came. A very wild, outstanding brawl, which is also the best I-Quit match ever)*****

It was one of Flair's greatest interviews and the TBS studio crowd was eating it up as Flair rattled off all the names of his opponents, faces and heels alike. Only one problem. No one saw it. As would often happen, the Atlanta Braves ran long that afternoon, the interview was pre-empted,and the show was joined in progress about 15 minutes in.

1925132,4,B0000DIJOW,"This DVD set is an extensive look at the career of professional wrestling's ""Nature Boy.""  Loads of interviews, classic matches and some modern material is all included in this package.

One of my favorite bits is the recent match with Triple H.  The post-show tribute is something every wrestling fan should see.  I rank the moment right up there with Hogan/Andre at WrestleMania III and the Owen Hart tribute on RAW.  It's a shame they didn't show it on television when it first occurred.

I only wish they included more of Ric's NWA/WCW Title wins, well, at least all of the ones that were televised.",1129420800,4,603,4.695238095238095
1925133,1,B0000DIJOW,"I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS WRESTLER IN PARTICULAR HE'S GOOD BUT THE BEST I DON'T THINK SO, THE REASON I DON'T REALLY LIKE FLAIR IS BECAUSE HE IS WHAT THEY CALL A ROUTINE MAN THAT'S WHAT THE LATE STU HART CALLED HIM AND HE IS RIGHT BASICLY HE DOES THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE OTHER THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT HIM IS HE SUCKS UP TO A LOT OF WRESTLERS AND CRITICIZES A WHOLE LOT OF WRESTLERS THE PEOPLE HE SUCKS UP IS HARLEY RACE, RICKY ""THE DRAGON"" STEAMBOAT, ARN ANDERSON, GREG ""THE HAMMER"" VALENTINE, SHAWN MICHAELS, AND TRIPLE H. AND HE TALKS TRASH TO THESE WRESTLERS WHO ARE THE BEST EVER BRUNO SAMMARTINO, ULTIMATE WARRIOR, ""MACHO MAN"" RANDY SAVAGE, MICK FOLEY AND BRET HART. I MEAN COME ON WOULD YOU WASTE ALL THIS MONEY FOR THIS DVD AFTER ALL THE TRASH HE SAID ABOUT THESE WRESTLERS, I WAS A RIC FLAIR FAN BUT AFTER WHAT I HEARD RIC FLAIR SAID TO THESE WRESTLERS FORGET IT! IT'S GARBAGE.",1128384000,7,910,4.265895953757226
1925134,1,B0000DIJOW,"Flair fans are in denial, because Ric Flair wrestles the same match  over and over again no matter his opponent.

The only reason you rednecks refuse to see it or acknowledge it, is because you grew up watching the man as children, idolizing him as your hero. You also have guys like HHH who is a huge mark for the guy, using his stroke to promote him as the greatest and keep the old man in the spot light where he doesn't deserve to be.

Ric Flair is the most overrated wrestler of all time.",1126483200,11,493,4.168421052631579
1925135,5,B0000DIJOW,"Ric Flair, without a doubt is the greatest wrestler of all time. This DVD set is a must for any Flair fans as it chronicles most of his ledgendary fueds. In his hey day Flair could carry a broomstick to a five star match. I've read reviews on this site that said Flair just booked himself to win the title. The bottom line is there was nobody else that could carry the blet like a Flair could.  It is also well known that he did not see eye to eye with Dusty Rhodes while Dusty was booker, so to say the greatest wrestler alive, past or present was given the title because he was friends with Dusty is proposterous.

1) Ric Flair vs Harley Race - This is a very slow match but tells  and excellent story. Poeple have to accept when buying these DVD's that wrestling was a lot slower in the 70's and 80's, so there is no point in complaining about it. This, whilst not a classic, is still a very good match - 7/10

2) Ric Flair vs Dusty Rhodes - Once again a slow match but another great story is told. Both men work their asses off and the crowd just eat the match up - 8/10

3) Ric Flair vs Barry Windham - What a match. The pace quickens with this one and Flair shows just why he is the man. His selling of Windhams every move is amazing, bearing in mind Flair is still moving in the 40th minute of the match as quickly as he is in the 1st. just a testament to the great man - 10/10

4) Ric Flair vs Terry Funk - This is their ledgendary I Quit match. Both men put so much effort into this, a great match - 9/10

5) Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat - This is there two out of three falls match, a classic - 10/10

6) Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat - Even better - 10/10

7) 1992 Royal Rumble - The best Rumble of all time, by a long way, another classic - 10/10

8) Ric Flair vs Sting-  An excellent match where once again Flair makes an up and comer look like gold - 9/10

There are also so many interviews on this set which are also amazing, as everybody knows that Flair cuts the best promo's in the business. In conclusion it is a pity that most of todays wrestling fans can not appreciate Ric Flair for what he was, and is, and that is the greatest wrestler of all time. I mean come on, HBK and HHH idolised this man growing up and these are two of the premier performers of this generation. As mentioned some of the earlier matches were slow, buts that what wrestling was in the 80's. For those who say this is boring are just too used to the three minute Raw and Smackdown matches we seem to get nowdays.",1125878400,5,2507,4.032258064516129
1925136,5,B0000DIJOW,K MATCH OF THE DVD IS THE RR 92. K I DONT NEED TO SAY WHY JUST GET THE DVD ITS VERY GOOD AND YOUR DUMB IF YOU DONT .,1123027200,3,116,2.9
1925137,5,B0000DIJOW,"In the 80's I was a wrestling fan as a teenager, it was just fun. When I got to college age I gave up on wrestling as being beneath me intellectually. At the time they still didn't admit it was staged though everyone knew it and this 'lie' bothered me. Fast forward to 2005, my brother in law is a wrestling fan, he tells me Ric Flair is still wrestling. I am surprised but a rush of nostalgia overtakes me. I end up at [...] looking at Flair clips and wondering what happened in the storylines over the past 15 years. Flair finally went to the WWF to face Hogan, like we all hoped would happen in high school?? Wow.
  Then I see this video at the store and buy it. I am thrilled. This is simply great entertainment. Flair is a legend for the simple reason that his character was cooler than anybody, and still is. No rock star is this flamboyant, no movie star has this much audacity. He is the best and it's his act that does it. He is a great wrestler, but wrestling is about telling a story, and Flair does it better than anyone. I regret not allowing myself to enjoy wrestling for so long, for acting like, just because I had a bachelors degree that I was above wrestling.
It's just fun, so I am glad I have this DVD and I am glad my boyhood hero is getting due recognition for all his hard work. At my house we cheered the Four Horsemen all the way. My girlfriends mom even questioned my morality ""You don't really want the bad guys to win do you?"" Hell yeah! Ric Flair represented success without any regrets. He represents determination, pride, integrity and (if the WWE writers are smart)should retire with a title around his waist.
I hope they come out with a volume 2, I will buy it I promise!
I would love to see these matches

something from the 70's I was too young then...Maybe
Flair vs Bobo Brazil (Flair won the U.S. title)

Flair vs. Nikita Koloff (here Flair played a real representative of American Capitalism vs the communists while Nikita played a monster.)

Flair vs Sting ( he has had better matches than the one on this DVD with Sting)

Flair vs Ricky Morton  (Morton oneof those guys that didn't get his due, excellent performer)

Flair vs Vader (supposed to be good, I'd love to see it)

Flair vs Savage (Remember Savage from Memphis area and slim jim commercials, apparently became a big star in the 90's)

Flair vs Bret Hart (Hart is supposed to be a great wrestler)

Flair vs Rob Van Dam (Again, heard it was good)

Anyone who buys this DVD will be glad they did if they take the time to really watch it and try to understand Flair's character. He epitomizes capitalism, individualism, determination, and style.

Whooooooo!",1121299200,4,2653,4.389795918367347
1925148,5,B0000DIJOW,"You cut a few promos;you clip the royal rumble,skip the DUSTY RHODES match and the second one with RICKY STEAMBOAT.Instead of those mentioned,you put the first championship match with DUSTY in 81 and you add the  ones with BOB BACKLUND and RICK MARTEL who were also champions of their federation when they fought FLAIR.I guess you can't have them all in one collection. RIC FLAIR was without a doubt the wrestler of the eighties,and any wrestling fan will enjoy at least the fight with HARLEY RACE and the first one with RICKY STEAMBOAT.I enjoyed the segment about the plane crash and the 1976 match at MADISON SQUARE GARDEN with PETE SANCHEZ.RIC FLAIR didn't change that much over the years. It was nice to end with the TRIPLE H match and the tribute that followed. You can buy that one without feeling guilty .",1119398400,2,812,4.678321678321678

Being used to watching high-flying matches, I didn't appreciate all the old Flair matches. Well, I've grown as a wrestling fan and now I realize just how special this 3 DVD set is. This is my most watched DVD, and I've watched the Steamboat matches god knows how many times. The only really weak match is the one they have with Sting. They decided to go the chronological route for the DVD so they included the 1994 match instead of their classic from Clash of the Champions I.",1110067200,4,565,4.390476190476191
1925150,5,B0000DIJOW,"I'll admit that I was alittle wary of buying this DVD because I'd been burned in the past with other wrestling DVDs having just clips of matches.  This one delivers the goods!  I would buy it just for the Flair/Steamboat matches.  You get on the 2nd disc two matches with ""The Dragon"" and both matches clock in at 60 minutes a piece!  That's right WWF.  These two fantastic future H.O.Fers wrestled for 60 MINUTES STRAIGHT!  That's 120 minutes of pure energy, high-flying, aggressive, welt smacking grappling at it's greatest.  The two matches with Flair and Steamboat are two of the finest examples of heavyweight wrestling EVER!  BUY THIS DVD JUST FOR THIS!
Also, The wrestling clinics featuring ""Steamboat"" and Flair are fantastic.
  The matches with Barry Windham are also classic wrestling clinics.  Barry Windham was a great grappler and he gave Flair all he could handle.
  The Terry Funk stuff just doesn't belong here.  It's interesting to see Flair trying to do extreme ECW style, but it isn't him at all.  I mean c'mon.  Terry Funk got his rump kicked by Patrick Swazy in ""Roadhouse""!  How tough can this guy really be?  The Royal Rumble stuff should have also been left out.  There are MUCH better Flair/Hogan matches that could have been shown other than this one.
  They should have put his classic battles with the OTHER ""Nature Boy"" Buddy Landel on these dics.  Watching those battle it out over who was the REAL ""Nature Boy"" were great matches.
  Seeing Flair's first WWWF match from '76 was also fun.  Seeing that he had his classic ""WOOOOOO"" and strut even way back then was fun to watch.  The interviews from Flair's past are also a blast to see.  Hearing Flair using his famous catch phrases for the first time and watching the ""Nature Boy"" image and persona take shape was interesting and enjoyable.
  Overall,  this is a GREAT DVD and Highly recommended.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",1109030400,4,1893,4.788819875776397
1925151,5,B0000DIJOW,"I just got this DVD from Best Buy. Originally, I was looking for DVDs like the real pay per view events such as WWE No Way Out 2004, WWE Wrestlemania 8X, or any of the WWE Royal Rumble(because I have never seen a full royal rumble before). But sadly, there was no pay per view DVDs in the Best Buy that I wanted except for WWE No Mercy 2004 and WWE Judgement Day 2004 which I didn't want to see. It was like watching a good smackdown. So I was looking and looking around for about an hour trying to find some decent wrestling DVDs and only ones that I could find was WWE RAW 10th Anniversary, Best Intercontinental Matches and The End of the ECW. Finally, right before giving up, something caught my eye. It was the Ultimate Ric Flair Collection. But I was still not sure whether to get it or not because I was afriad that there will be no full matches(like The Rock Know Your Role and TLC video). But I made up my mind and just got it since there was no other better WWE DVDs.

After I got home I started watching it right away and after I finished half of the DVD, I was like this is worth even $100. But the price being only about $30, that is more reason why anyone should buy this DVD. The DVD featured over 10.5 hours of pure wrestling entertainment including his best matches, best promos, and the confidentials. Not to mention the fact that some of the features are hilarious(like the old wrestling makes me laugh because it's my first time seeing it and they had some funny promos). Also, because of this DVD, the whole entire Sunday went by like Flash on steroids. I don't see any reason why I should write anymore because other reviewers already wrote what the features are and I have nothing else to say to you but ""Get the F out of your couch or chair or bed or whatever and go get the the most worth DVD (over 10.5 hours! amazing!) ever.

P.S. Also get more wrestling DVDs. The reason why I get wrestling DVDs instead of movies is because once you watch most of the movies, it gets boring really fast. They are also only about 2 to 4 hours long including the extra features. But wrestling DVDs are usually 3 hours long not including the extra features itself. If you combine the features, it will probably be up to 4-7 hours of entertainment. Though the DVDs like HBK From the Vault, WWE Raw 10th anniversary, or Stone Cold biography videos, or any other documentary DVDs are a bit short and it doesn't worth as much as pay per views or the special collection DVDs like Ric Flair collection and Hulk Hogan collection, you should get it if you are a big fan but if you can't afford that much money, get the pay per view DVDs over the movie-like DVDs. Well, have fun watching the DVDs.",1107734400,3,2697,4.286274509803921
1925152,4,B0000DIJOW,"When I see Ric Flair I wonder why the hell is this guy so famous? His moves, charisma, and performances are all the same in every match it seems. I purchased this dvd used because I love pro wrestling-past and present. This guy had some amazing matchs with Ricky Steamboat and its on here, and plus a Royal Rumble match in its entirty so that might be worth the price alone. Also I can try and figure out why everyone is calling this guy so great. Anther thing about the DVD is there is ten matchs and every match expect for one is over ten minutes, so you cant complain about that. Id recommend it to a true wrestling fan who doesnt think The Rock or Stone Cold is the greatest wrestler ever.",1107648000,,693,4.2180451127819545
1925153,4,B0000DIJOW,"Big words. Small mind.  That is really all I thought of when I read your review.  You spout off ridiculous comments about an entertaining sport that you neither watch nor care for.  If you were a fan and found this dvd ridiculous, then I would not be sitting here typing out a response to you.  But you have the gall to get up on your f***ing pedestal and act as if you are the end all of the perfect person.  Newsflash, no one is even remotely close to perfect...you least of all.  If the attitude that you have comes with a high vocabulary, then I will gladly rid myself of all the books I own, and stand amongst the ranks of the stupid and mindless.

I make no claim to ""WRESTLING"" being real nor fake.  That has been long disputed, and there is truth to both sides.  As for the remarks about wrestling being debilitating to the minds of children, think again, all high and mighty.  You are no different than the critics that spout off crap about music, television, movies, comics...and countless other sources of media that is presented to our children.  Children are a product of their environment.  And while the media does play a part in that, consider the source of parenting.  Or how about the teachers.  Children sit in history and government and learn all about popular historical icons such as Hitler, Stalin, Napolean, Caesar.  Every single one of them has killed innocent people, along with other heinous crimes that to this day plague our society.  Did they watch wrestling?  Is that why they killed, maimed, degraded others with their philosophy?  Or was it because of things like religion?  Mental illness?  Or other forms of mental manipulation?

I could go on and on about the crap that you have spouted on this subject, but I do NOT want to be as boring and hypocritical as you.

In closing, I have two things to say to you.

1) If you are not a fan, then stay the hell away from anything that resembles wrestling.  You will not deter fans from purchasing this item if they so choose.

2) Where in the hell do you get off insulting our intelligence?!  I have a college degree. I work full time in a very promanent company. To top it off, I sure as hell can make my own INFORMED and EDUCATED decisions about what to watch.

Take a hike.  I may not speak for everyone, but for those that agree... You're critique is not welcome here.

DVD:

Whew!  Now that I have that out of the way.  I can talk about the DVD set without getting upset...well, even more upset.

Ric Flair is one of the legends that will transcend time whether in the ring or out of it.  I won't go into the matches on the dvd since others have done a wonderful job reviewing it.  Needless to say, this is a favorite amongst my ever-growing collection and I will have no qualms recommending this to others.  If you are a fan of Whoo!!, then this is for you. :)",1102550400,7,2845,4.393474088291747
1925154,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is #9 in my best 130 WWE DVD's.  This DVD doesn't have many good matches so I'm not gonna get into them but the stories they tell alone are worth the money.  Flair is always gonna be a legen no matter what you do to him.

So overall just pick this DVD up and you will learn something about one of the greatest wrestlers alive today.  You all this he was always this slow and old then see this DVD.",1102118400,,402,3.925925925925926
1925155,5,B0000DIJOW,"Ok so from the beginning I am the biggest Ric Flair fan in the whole frickin' world.  The man is THE greatest wrestler in the whole world.  Having said that this DVD is the tribute the NWA/WCW owes him yet the WWE is smart enough to do and make some coin off it.

Of all the WWE DVDs this is my favorite by far.  Even if you don't live and breathe Flair you'll still like it.  The presentation of each chapter is really cool with plenty of extras.  My highlights would be

1. The Terry Funk ""Hardcore"" Chapter.  The ""I Quit"" match with Terry Funk is my favorite match of all time.  This part does include all the build up to this incredible, pioneering feud.  The fact that Gary Hart gets air time is great alone.  Whereas Flair is my favorite grappler, Funk is right up there.

2. Harley Race and the NWA Title.  Again, I'm from Iowa and live in KC,MO so I'm totally sold on the Race legend.  Harley's bounty promo is completely awesome and blows away any schpiel put out on RAW or Smackdown.  Any fan of Mid-Atlantic wrestling will enjoy this chapter since all of it is from the first Starcade and Carolina tapings.

3. The Plane Crash segment.  This is THE most detailed expose on the Flair plane wreck in the mid 70s.  Includes interviews with Flair, David Crockett and a fan present at the taping they had to cancel.  Very chilling and very honest.

4. A Day In The Life Of The Horsemen.  The most fun part of the DVD.  Flair, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard recount their glory days in the 80s.  Very cool.

Again this is a must buy for any wrestling fan.  The only and I mean only shortcoming is the Sting match they picked.  I don't why they didn't put the 1988 Clash Of The Champions match in there.

BUY THIS DVD!!!  WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",1101945600,4,1749,4.3312693498452015

I am sorry, but I've never had the privelage of seeing this DVD (although I hope to in the near future).  But back to you, Macontash.  I have been a wrestling fan for about 10 years (I am 16 years old), and it is one of the main things for me right.  It isn't ""a sope opera with fat guys"" as some might call it.  It is an art that has struggle, survival, victory, and defeat.  So, after all that, let me leave you with this... IF I EVER SEE YOU, I WILL NOT HESITATE TO NOT ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU, BUT TO ALSO KNOCK EVERY ONE OF THOSE TEETH YOU HAVE OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.",1101686400,,652,3.9015151515151514
1925167,5,B0000DIJOW,"I will get to the Ric Flair DVD set momentarily.  First of all, I must address the ""review"" written by a certain person here on this site.  ""Malcontent Colussus..."" or whatever the hell you call yourself, I must say you definitely deserve to be put in your place after writing such a piece of babbling garbage.

First of all, you refer to wrestling fans as suffering from ""ineptness""...I suggest you read over your article again and then decide who is inept.  It probably took you an entire year just to think of that pathetic name you referred to yourself as.  The rest of that paragraph just tells me that you don't know what the hell your talking about, you just ramble on and on and it makes absolutely no sense.

Then you mentioned about the survey of teachers who badmouthed wrestling.  To blame wrestling for the children misbehaving is totally pathetic as well...it is just an excuse to cover up poor parenting and cover up teachers who cannot control their students...it has nothing to do with wrestling and I find blaming wrestling for that is really sad.

Then you mention about women in wrestling, how they're [...] and such.  You may fail to realize this...which doesn't surprise me...that women make up a good majority of wrestling fans.  If wrestling were as you described it...you would think no women would watch it...correct?  Another paragraph of mindless babble.

In conclusion...I have been a wrestling fan for a good majority of my life...I love wrestling...and I always will.  Wrestling fans are the greatest fans in the world...hands down...and wrestlers are the greatest performers and entertainers in the world...and to badmouth it like that is an insult to these men and women who put their bodies on the line day in and day out for their fans.  To group wrestling fans into one large group and insult them is totally wrong.  What you're trying to prove in that ""review"" is beyond me.  I suggest that you know your role and SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

Anyway...on to the Ric Flair DVD set...I have had this set for a long time and it is one of the greatest sets ever.  It has great footage of Flair from the 80's in the old NWA...classic stuff...his speech on the last WCW Nitro...and a ton of other material...inclusing hidden Easter eggs and interviews.

1925171,4,B0000DIJOW,"The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection is a 3 DVD set chronicling the career of probably the best wrestler in history, Ric Flair.  It is a great collection for any long time wrestling fan and features some of his greatest matches in history.  Every match on this set contains the full match and many bonus features to go along with the match and pre-match and post-match interviews.

Disc 1:

1. Ric Flair vs. Harley Race (Starrcade 1983 - NWA Championship)

Good match between two legends.  This match stemmed from Harley Race injuring Flair's back and forcing him to retire.  (9/10)

Some of the bonus features for this match include Harley Race putting a bounty on Ric Flair and Flair retiring from wrestling due to the attack.

2. Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes (Starrcade 1985 - NWA Championship)

Although Dusty may not be the best wrestler, he always puts on one heck of a show.  These two worked great together and put on another great match.  (9/10)

One of the bonus features include Flair and Arn Anderson snapping Dusty Rhodes ankle inside a steel cage.

3. Ric Flair vs. Barry Windham (1/20/1987 - NWA World Championship)

Very entertaining match.  These two put on a heck of a show.  Props go out to both men for this classic.  (9.5/10)

One of the bonus features include Flair and Windham in another classic from a week before the above match.  Another great match. (9.5/10)

Disc 2:

The first chapter on disc chronicles Flair's legendary battles with Ricky Steamboat.  This particular chapter includes two of their matches.

1. Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat (Clash of the Champions VI - NWA Championship)

This is a classic.  These two just mix so well together.  It reminds of Angle and Benoit of today.  Great match.  (10/10)

2. Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat (WrestleWar 1989 - NWA Championship)

Another classic.  It is better than the above match. Great match based contest with many submission moves, reversals, and close falls.  One of the best ever.  (10/10)

The bonus features include the lead up to these two matches.

3. Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk (Clash of the Champions IX - I Quit Match)

These two were best of friends, turned bitter enemies due to the Funk attack on Flair.  This is a very interesting match because it is one the earlier Hardcore matches and one of the first times you will ever see a table used.  Good match.  (9/10)

Again the bonus features just give a lead in to the above match.

Disc 3:

This disc contains the WWE/WCW portions of Flair's career.

1. 1992 Royal Rumble

This is the Rumble in which the WWF tile was vacant and the winner of the Rumble would become WWF Champion.  Royal Rumbles are always great.  It is awesome to see all of the old time superstars in this match.  Very nostalgic.  (9/10)

The bonus features basically talk about Flair coming to the WWF from the NWA.

2. Ric Flair vs. Sting (Clash of the Champions XXVII - WCW Title)

I was a little surprised to see this match, only because these two have had some other classic battles.  Still a great match nonetheless.  You gotta love Sting.  I hope he comes to the WWE.  Another classic.  (9.5/10)

One of the bonus features include Sting getting kicked out of the Four Horsemen.

3. Ric Flair vs. Triple H (RAW 5/19/2003 - World Heavyweight Title)

Flair shows he can still put on a great performance in this match.  Very exciting.  The crowd was really into it.  One of the better matches of the year in the WWE.  Probably not top ten, but definately top 15.  (9/10)

The bonus feature for this match shows the post match celebration/dedication to Flair.  You can see the admiration other wrestlers have for Flair and Flair's dedication and love for the sport.

Some of the other bouns features includes Flair's first match in the then WWWF in 1976 against Pete Sanchez.  Another emotional bonus feature is Flair addressing the audience at the final WCW Nitro.

I would pick up this DVD if you are a long time wrestling fan.  If you are recent fan and don't like see the old school type of wrestling, stay away.

1925172,1,B0000DIJOW,"This dvd set defines overrated. Flair admittedly has a great current act as the crazy old man but he is a horrible wrestler, people must have had long attention spans in the 80s because his ""classic"" matches would be DUDs today. To make it worse all his matches are the same and way too long. What do you expect, 80s people thought space invaders was a good game.

I would rate this dvd 0 stars, but I decided to give 1 star because this dvd is quite generous giving 3 packed disks for the price of 1. However, 10.5 hours of crap is still crap.",1093305600,3,544,4.180952380952381
1925173,5,B0000DIJOW,"Every wrestling fan should own this. If you don't have it, go & pick it up today. Not tomorrow, not next week. TODAY!",1092873600,,117,4.130434782608695
1925174,5,B0000DIJOW,"In the long, proud annals of professional wrestling, one name stands alone.  One man walked that aisle thousands of times to give the fans, whether they loved him or hated him, everything he had.  One man fought them all and beat them all.  One man could stay all night, and stay a little longer, take all the ladies for rides on Space Mountain and then make them cry, and still get in that ring night in and night out and be the man.  When you say ""Champ,"" you can only be referring to the 16-time heavyweight champion of the world, the Nature Boy Ric Flair.

This is a fantastic collection that all Ric Flair fans must own.  Three DVDs is not enough to even begin to cover his illustrious career, of course, so every fan will have loads of matches that are not included in this collection.  Still, there's a ton of great stuff here, 11 hours worth of wrestling matches, interviews, and classic Flair moments.  From his first televised match to his final appearances on Nitro and Raw, this is a wonderful tribute to a man who meant more to his sport than any other athlete ever will.  I was fortunate enough to grow up right here in Ric Flair country - I have many wonderful memories of the old NWA days with Ric, Valentine, the Andersons, Steamboat, and all the other greats.  Ric Flair was unique, maintaining a core set of fans regardless of whether he was a good guy or a bad guy.  When it comes to being bad, of course, he was the best - the dirtiest player in the game.  All those fans up north thought Hulk Hogan was the man, but that was only because they didn't get a chance to really see Flair until the advent of cable television.  I'll admit Hogan and his kind are big and bad, but they aren't really wrestlers in the true sense of the word.  Flair knew how to wrestle, and that made him the ultimate paragon of wrestling tradition.

So what all do you get here?  You get Flair's emotional, hard-fought victory over Harley Race at Starrcade '83 (this was back in the day when bleeding was not only allowed, it was encouraged) - this is one of the longest, most physical matches I've ever seen.  You get two of Flair's fights against former Four Horseman Barry Windham, as well.  Then there's Dusty Rhodes, the American Dream; he and Flair had a heated rivalry back in the '80s.  Now you can relive some of that belligerent fun with Flair's matchup against Rhodes in Starrcade '85.  Best of all, though, is the footage of the Four Horsemen breaking Dusty's ankle after Dusty came into the steel cage to help Flair after a match.  It's one of my favorite wrestling memories of all time, and now I can relive the fun of Dusty's agony over and over again.

Moving on to Disc 2, the main focus is on Ricky Steamboat.  Steamboat was right there supporting Ric after he beat Harley Race in '83, but there was no love lost between these two incredible competitors a few short years later.  You get two Flair-Steamboat matchups in this collection: Clash of the Champions VI (2 out of 3 falls) and WrestleWar 1989.  Flair's fight against the despicable Terry Funk at Clash of the Champions IX closes out the disc.  Disc 3 is truly special.  First off, you get to watch Flair do the impossible at the WWF 1992 Royal Rumble: outlast the best wrestlers in WWF for an incredible 62 minutes, having been the third man to enter the ring.  Bobby Heenan is beside himself throughout the entire match because no one had ever even thought of the third man in a rumble actually winning the group melee.  That night, Flair showed WWF what many of us already knew - the Nature Boy was the greatest wrestler the world will ever see.  You also get Flair's matchup against Sting, the man he considers his toughest opponent of them all, at Clash of the Champions XXVII.  Then, after watching Flair bid farewell to WCW Monday Nitro, you get to see Flair's final moment in the sun as he takes on Triple HHH, live on Raw, for the world championship belt.  Flair shows the world what a 54-year-old man can do.  After the show went off the air, the crowd got to witness a very special tribute to the Nature Boy - the respect they show this greatest of all champions is incredibly moving, especially for those of us who grew up watching and supporting Ric Flair.

I haven't even mentioned all of the extras and Easter eggs - there are tons of them.  Ric talks about the plane crash that almost killed him early in his career, his opponents, and his career; there are a number of vintage interviews with Flair going back all the way to the mid-70s, there are pre- and post-match interviews for most of the matches included in the collection, and there is even the tape of Ric Flair's first televised wrestling match back on March 1, 1976 against Pete Sanchez in Madison Square Garden.

Whatever you think of Vince McMahon and WWE, it is important to know that McMahon allowed Flair to go out in style.  Eric Bischoff and WCW treated Flair horribly in the later years of his career, despite the fact that Ric Flair essentially was WCW.  We would have none of the tributes included on this collection (heck, we wouldn't even have this Ultimate Ric Flair Collection) were it not for McMahon's efforts to treat the Nature Boy like the champion he was.",1092355200,8,5226,4.462105263157895
1925175,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is a great DVD set no matter how you look at it.

I can't wait for volume 2.  Hopefully they will include his feuds with Savage, Vader, etc.  I hope they also put the entire 45-minute Clash of Champions match with Sting.",1091404800,3,225,4.186046511627907
1925176,5,B0000DIJOW,"Vince McMahon has truly outdone himself, and has used his investment of the purchase of the WCW vaults WISELY. I now own footage of Flair that a few years ago was virtually impossible to buy. Quite possibly the greatest wrestling DVD in the market today, fittingly for the Greatest Wrestler in the History of the Sport.
 We see the debut of the Nature Boy, hear all about the death defying plane crash, and hear about the greatest feuds of his incredible career. We see the BS that he had to go through in WCW, and see what the idiots like Bishoff running that organization tried to do to a True legend. We saw the incredible feuds with Race and Rhodes, with Steamboat and Windham, I was lucky enough to view two of those wars live, and it was a highlight of my life for sure. The footage of he and Piper wrestling amateur style in a studio and what happens is worth the cost of the DVD alone.
Ric Flair, simply put, is Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling is Ric Flair. He is everything that is great about the sport, he is a representative of all that is honorable.  Eric Bishoff got his in the end, and now is a towel boy for Vince, and a joke among wrestling circles,  while Ric is finally getting the respect he deserves, and that night in NC when all the wrestlers toasted him after the match with Triple H is, if you are a real wrestling fan, what this sport is all about. Ric Flair is to pro wrestling what Joe Namath is to football, what Kurt Angle is to amateur wrestling, what Dr. J is to basketball, what Reggie Jackson is to baseball. A representative of what a World Champion is all about, and a touch of class. He is a limosine riding, jet flying, whiskey drinking, kiss stealing son of a gun, and whether you like it, or don't like it, learn ot love it, because Luger, Sting, Nikita, Big Dust, Race, Hogan, Windham, Steamboat, if you wanna BE the Man, you gotta BEAT the man, and thats impossible, because Ric Flair can make or break you, and he is the best going today, and I say Slick Ric has got one more championship run left at Wrestlemania XXI, before they create the Wing of the Nature Boy at the Hall of Fame, and the 10 pounds of Gold, the original NWA title needs to go into the casket of Ric Flair when he dies, surrounding the waist of the greatest athlete of his generation. Long live the Nature Boy, and may his grandchildren inherit the Earth!",1088726400,8,2370,4.309417040358745
1925177,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is without doubt the best WWE Video that has ever been produced. Never before has a man so great as Ric Flair been so honored with a DVD Collection like this one. The $30 for this 3 Disc Set alone is a bargain. The DVD is packed with Flair's historic matches with Harley Race, Ricky Steamboat, Barry Windam, Terry Funk. There are bonus materials on each discs that include interviews, promos, and heated pre-match battles. Some this stuff I haven't seen since I was a small child. A lot of the footage on the set is extremely hard/almost impossible to find anywhere. This is one DVD that's a keepsake and kept for future wrestling generations. Ric Flair is one of the best of all time, and after you watch this DVD will see that.
It's all here. The Ric Flair Ultimate DVD Collection recounts so of the greatest moments in this man's career. Starting from the early mid-Atlantic days of the 1980s.
In DISC 1, Flair battles the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race at the biggest extravaganza at the time ""Starrcade 1983"". Before Wrestlemania there was Starrcade and it was a night filled with excitement & carnage. Ric Flair took on Harley Race is one of the bloodiest and most brutal Steel Cage matches ever.

After the feud with Harley Race, Flair moves on his way to becoming the jet-flying limo riding kiss stealin wheelin dealin son-of-gun. The established ment of the Four Horsemen takes place. Flair becomes ruthless along with the Horsemen. At Starrcade 1985 is culminates in a match against The American Dream himself Dusty Rhodes. BONUS FEATURES include: PROMOS leading up to the match and the brutal attack on Rhodes via the Four Horsemen.
Moving right into the mid 1980s, Flair finds himself a new foe, Barry Windham. The entire match from January 20, 1987 in which Flair defends the NWA Championship against Windham is one of the great classics. For 60 minutes they battled until the Television Time Limit expired and the results were left unfinished. BONUS FEATURES included: Flair & the Horseman attacking the US Tag Team Champions, Windham & Ronny Garvin, a match between Flair vs Windham on January 13th turns into chaos. And much more.
DISC 2
On DISC 2, Flair talks about his biggest rivalry against his greatest competitor Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat. Flair & Steamboat's 2 classic matches are featured the first at Clash of the Champions VI and the other at WrestleWar 1989. These classic matches by two of the best pound for pound athletes are simply tremendous.

The decade of the 1980s finally closes out with Flair's classic ""I QUIT"" match against Hardcore Icon Terry Funk at Clash of the Champions IX. Back and forth the two went, it was a tremendous display of blood, sweat, and tears, until one couldn't take it anymore. BONUS FEATURES included: Press Conference announcing Flair's return to the ring, Terry Funk's brutal attack trying to suffocate Ric Flair with a garbage bag, and promos galore.
Also included on Disc 2 are recaps of The Plane Crash involving Flair and others in 1975, History of the 4 Horsemen, and a day in the life of the Horsemen.

On Disc 3 we finally reach Flair's WWF/WWE years. Flair talks about leaving the NWA/WCW because of his bitter relationship with Jim Herd and taking with him the NWA Championship Belt because of not receiving his $25,000 deposit for the championship. His entire 1992 Royal Rumble victory is here, one of the most memorable Rumbles ever, Flair last nearly and hour in the ring drawing number 3 in order. In my opinion this Flair's finest hour as a professional wrestler. He took home the WWF Championship in great fashion. BONUS FEATURES include: The first WWE TV Debut on September 9, 1991. Promos on about Rowdy Roddy Piper & Hulk Hogan, and his Royal Rumble post match interview and presentation of receiving the championship belt from WWF President Jack Tunney.
Flair's short year & half stint the WWE was in his own words the most fun he's ever had. In returned to WCW in late 1993, the next chapter tells about his feud with Sting. There match at Clash of The Champions XXVII to determine the title Unification was a great match. BONUS FEATURES include: Sting's banishment from the Horsemen, and Promos leading up to the match.

After viewing all these features you will have the total Ric Flair experience embedded into your brain. This is a must for any wrestling fan WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",1084838400,7,5327,4.75377969762419
1925178,4,B0000DIJOW,"I'm not much of a wrestling fan, but what little I do know about it comes down to this.  Pat Patterson, Rocky Johnson, Hank Renner, SACTO back when! . . . I Know Where It's At!  And, yeah, Ric Flair's something of a giant.  Not Andre mind you but something of a tag team artist back then . . .  O.k.  Yeah, he took on, what's his name-- Harley Race?-- or Clod Von Erich?  or ""Steamboat"" (""Steamboat""-- gimme a break)?  Mainly he (Ric) was an Inside promoter guy who could skip matches, pay off ""opponents,"" pay off the refs, to the point where they'd slap down one, two, three, four, five, six, seven-- yeah, that's right-- THEN they'd start counting the count . . . THEN it'd be one, two, THEN OOps ""Flair's got his foot over the rope!"", and THEN the Ref says Well, I guess the match is a Draw, and Flair runs out of the ring, title still in hand, 'cuz it's a draw (remember those rules?).  People would boo.  (""BOOO!"")  It was great.  But Flair, show some skills, pal!  Show up for each match!
I admire Flair, though!  ""Title"" still in hand, one day Fleihr erred when he took on that patsy-- comedian Andy Kaufmann, who double-crossed him, stole a quick one on the Nature Boy, and then Kaufman took his act to Memphis, Tennessee, where Flair and Lawler started going at it, in a little noted chapter in wrestling history.  Here's where it gets really inside.  Thing is, this isn't talked about, 'cuz Kaufman's move kept the Nature Boy pinned to the mat SO LONG it's EMBARRASSING, and the Ref couldn't easily do that ""hesitation""  before Count 3 move-- you Flair fans KNOW what I'm talking about! (Kaufman's move relied on the fact of Flair's back pain, so that Flair's attempt to roll out allowed Kaufman to ""top"" pin him severely, while the actual roll-out move still showed Flair's shoulders both ABJECTLY on the mat-- as Kaufman summoned the ref, ""Start the count, start the count, who's payin' 'ya, pal?""  Very funny, actually.  You can hear this, even on my copy of the tape, as Flair screams ""AHHHH!"" and the crowd goes wild.)
Proof?  See, this was back in '83, when vid-cams were scarce.  Alas, at the Mid-South Coloseum-- yeah-- Mid-South's the name on the tape, and I'm sure that's right, Mid-South Memphis and yes, Nature Boy, don't contradict me 'cuz folks actually DID videotape the thing!  It's a little loud, and a little distorted, but you can hear Flair screaming ""Ahhhh!""-- in pain, AS IF he's not getting pinned (though Kaufman IS pinning him)-- To me, this is one of the greatest suppressed moments in Big Time Sports!  FLAIR GETS HIS BUTTISSIMO KICKED BY KAUFMAN! (I'm told that thsi was in the first draft of ""Man in the Moon"" but taken out . . . Get hold of the very FIRST scrreenplay which has some Flair stuff in it if you can, because, even though half of THAT is made up, it's funny.)  But that cheap move by Kaufmann totally befuddled the Ref-- that's great-- you've gotta hand it to Kaufmann for breaking out of the, uh, scenario to do that.  Flair's bio probably dis-includes all that 'cuz he's squeamish about the back pain plus getting pinned in the middle of the ring.
Anyway, out of all this Kaufman/Tennessee/Lawler-related stuff--and this is VERY inside stuff-- Flair decided to take his act to the WCW in lieu of the (then) WWF-- and he got into that thing with Rhodes.  In one sense Flair won.  (You remember-- the 4 Horseman have ""a new mare!""  Great!)  That's Flair's sell point, y'know-- always losing, never quite lost.  So Flair, with a little help from theose klazy fans who buy into all that Nature Boy stuff about Yeah I lose but I'm still a great athelete-- Flair wiht a little Insider help salvaged that Rhodes match and went on to perform some great matches (I admit) with Steamboat and Savage.  But these guys (Steamboat won't talk about it) always laugh at how Kaufman had that move, where he flipped the Figure Four and pinned the Nature Boy who couldn't pull out of it w/o hurting his back.  I'm sure Flair didn't plan it that way, but you gotta hand it to the late Andy Kaufman.  I mean, I'm talkin' Slick Andy not Slick Ric-- Got it, Nature Boy?!  I know it burns I know it hurts I know it stings but wrestling fans deserve the Truth.  By the way, there were other people taping the match and they had some better views and equipment than me, so I know that, um, Fliehr would feel compelled to deny the whole thing...
Anyway, YOU, Flair, had some very fine moments, and I think you'll be very represenative of the folks of Norht Carolina if you elect to attain the Governorship, by acclamation, no doubt, in, whooh! NoCaro.
And Wrestling FAns out there, try to disprove this review!  See, this DVD-- it OMITS stuff!  I didn't even get into the episode where not Jerry Lee Lewis (who was scheduled) but Jimmy Swaggart-- yes, Swaggart!-- sang the National Anthem in a runup to a Nature Boy title defense!  JIM BAKKER was FRONT ROW, at that time!  There's a photo!  WWE should release this as a single!  (Perhaps a ""retro"" ""45,"" with Bakker on the cover.  WHOOOOOH!)",1083801600,,5019,4.513842746400886
1925179,4,B0000DIJOW,"It took almost 2 years after his return to the WWE, but the company has finally released a Ric Flair compilation set, the largest single set ever dedicated to one performer.  Lots of rare promotional interviews and footage from Flair's heyday in the 1980's, along with some of his most popular matches against opponents such as Ricky Steamboat, Terry Funk, Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, and more.  Flair himself acts as host and provides insight into the opponents, the matches, and the performances featured.  There are also interviews with Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, frequent on screen partners for Flair during the height of his career in the 1980's.  Among the rarities featured is an excellent 5 star 1987 match between Flair and Barry Windham, the May 2003 Flair/Triple H match and the never shown on TV post show Ric Flair tribute, and Flair's memorable 1992 62 minute performance to win the WWE World Title at the 1992 Royal Rumble, in which he battled against such notable wrestling stars as Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Sid Justice, Jake Roberts, Roddy Piper, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker, among others.  Flair also talks in depth about the 1975 plane crash in which he nearly died.  Other notable items include his World Title win over Steamboat (Pro Wrestling Illustrated Magazine's 1989 Match Of The Year) and early footage from 1976 when Flair was returning to action after the plane crash and was just formulating his now legendary ""Nature Boy Ric Flair"" character.  Wrestling fans will truly enjoy this collection (3 DVD's in all, nearly 11 hours of footage) and Ric Flair fans will adore it.  On the negative side, very little of Flair's 1990's career is featured, with little or no mention of Flair's work vs Hogan, Savage, The NWO story, or Vader at all.  Flair had some truly memorable performances during that time that time that are not chronicled, but his career in wrestling is literally big enough to support two collections the size of this one so only so much can be featured in one set.  Maybe the WWE should take note and release a follow up set.  When first released, this collection was the biggest selling WWE DVD release in company history so there is a market out there.",1083542400,4,2211,4.838196286472148
1925180,5,B0000DIJOW,"This excellent DVD is what I believe to be a test and launching pad for a series made in the same format. Aside from the contributing factor of the subject matter to the greatness of this DVD, the format itself is innovative and successful. Many fans have been clamoring for such a format for years, and what a wrestler to start it with!
The set is divided into three sections, each on its own DVD, detailing different eras in the Nature Boy's career. Fans of 1980's Flair will be overcome with nostalgia as Flair works in the ring with the likes of Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat and Barry Windham. Old school interviews round out these matches, making viewers yearn for the old days of wrestling. The matches are shown in their entirety, allowing you to get into the psychology and intensity, which is lost when they are shown in clips, as evidenced in the form of From the Vault on WWE television programming.
If you are a Ric Flair fan, or a wrestling fan in general, then this DVD is for you. It's a living history and record of the transformation of the pro wrestling industry in one package. And for the price, it's an absolute steal.",1083196800,2,1153,4.521531100478469
1925191,5,B0000DIJOW,"Ric Flair IS the greatest of all time. There will NEVER be another performer like this man, and this DVD shows exactly why. This is possibly the most AWESOME DVD ever released by the WWE and it will likely stay that way until the WWE releases a Bret Hart DVD. But onto this DVD. It's AWESOME like I said before. Here's my review:
Disc One
vs. Harley Race, Starrcade 83 (this excellent match is of much of slower pace than today's type matches, but it's worth a look) *****
vs. Dusty Rhodes, Starrcade 85 (not a classic, but give it a look ONLY if you've never seen it before) **1/2
vs. Barry Windham, Worldwide 87 (this AWESOME match got the ENTIRE Worldwide show in 87, and if not for the Savage vs. Steamboat match at Wrestlemania III, this would've been the match of the year)*****
Disc Two
vs. Ricky Steamboat, Clash Of The Champions VI, 2/3 Falls (classic, classic, classic, this one IS breathtaking)*****
vs Ricky Steamboat, WrestleWar 89 (another classic with Steamboat where Flair wins the NWA title for the 6th time, they had the greatest series of matches EVER in 1989)*****
vs. Terry Funk, Clash Of The Champions IX, I-Quit match (one of the first true matches to embrace the hardcore stipulation before ECW came, a wild, outstanding brawl, the best I-Quit match ever)*****
Disc Three
The 1992 Royal Rumble match (this rumble match set the standard for all preceding rumbles to follow, Flair's one man show is one for the ages)*****
vs. Sting, Clash Of The Chaampions XXVII (not that great, but give it a look if you never seen it) ***
Also, check out the bonus features and easter eggs as well.
Overall, this DVD is a must have for ANY wrestling fan. BUT, it's missing A LOT of CLASSIC material that should've made this DVD, such as:
vs. Sting (Clash Of The Champions I)
vs. Lex Luger (Starrcade 88)
vs. Ricky Steamboat (Chi-Town Rumble 89)
vs. Terry Funk (Great American Bash 89)
vs. Luger (Wrestlewar 90)
vs. Luger (Capital Combat 90)
vs. Randy Savage (Wrestlemania VIII)
vs. Vader (Starrcade 93)

1925192,5,B0000DIJOW,"It's debatable, but in my opinion Ric Flair is the greatest wrestler of all time, and this DVD included all his greatest matches. I would've liked to have seen the Flair/Sting Clash 1 match, Flair/Vader, and Flair/Steamboat at Chi-Town, but the fact that they included some awesome matches I'd NEVER thought would grace a DVD gives this an easy 5 *'s.

1. Ric Flair Vs. Harley Race (83) - Great old-school match with Race brutalizing a determined Flair inside the confines of a steel-cage! A true passing of the torch and it's cool to see Race on DVD. ****1/2

2. Ric Flair Vs. Dusty Rhodes (85) - Dusty wants revenge against Flair after the 4 horsemen break his ankle. As far as Dusty matches it's not bad. **1/2

3. Ric Flair Vs. Barry Windham (87) - These 2 regularly had 90-min matches at house shows (imagine that now!) and if anyone had Flair's number it was Windham as he almost won the title on numerous occasions. Everyone thought he would finally dethrone Flair on TV... or would he..? *****

4. Ric Flair Vs. Ricky Steamboat (89 - II) - 2 out of 3 falls shown free on TV. This is my ALL-time favorite match as Flair tries to regain his title from the Steamer. *****

5. Ric Flair Vs. Ricky Steamboat (89 - III) - Wrestler War. The 2 greatest wrestlers in the world at the time, (and evenly matched) wrestle for the most respected title in the world. You know I barely blink when I see people going through tables anymore, but the Flair/Steamboat chops STILL make me winc when I see 'em! *****

6. Ric Flair Vs. Terry Funk (89 - Clash) - I-Quit match. WOW! Awesome! I'm glad (and surprised) they included this great match! Flair/Funk had been feuding like manaics for months and this was THE match to settle the feud and see who the better man was. *****

7. Royal Rumble (1992) - I was afraid they would clip this match, but it's shown complete. My match of 1992. When Flair entered the WWF I figured he would be built up, then lose to Hogan a billion times. Instead he lasts almost the entire Rumble with a finish that I consider my biggest mark-out moment of all time :-) Plus ""The Brains"" commentary makes this the greatest Rumble of all-time. *****

8. Ric Flair Vs. Sting (94?) - WCW Vs. NWA (International belt) Unification match. These two have had much better matches, such as their 5-star Clash 1 match, but this one was good. ***1/2

9. Ric Flair Vs. Triple-H (2003) - Flair goes for the WWE championship belt. This match is in the extra section and is a great match, but much too short. **

And there you go.. The greatest wrestling DVD off all time..",1078704000,18,2573,4.432203389830509
1925193,4,B0000DIJOW,"This DVD was superb. I have already seen a few of these matches, and even own some. But the clairty on DVD is super. The interviews, and angles leading up to the matches were wonderful to see. I remember seeing alot of this growing up, but it was so cool to see it again after so many years. The only thing I was kind of disappointed about was the fact that they chose to do so many long matches instead of shorter matches and more of them.

1925196,5,B0000DIJOW,"When I first read reviews on the DVD and asked some friends who've already purchased it, I guess I would want to see it but not buy it. Well I did and could not be any happier.
When reading the back seeing names like Barry Windham,Dusty Rhodes,Harley Race  I have to be honest that it really doesn't excite me. But I mean the backround events and amount of countless and endless  features and thoughts going into them was awesome. Anyhow the following is my opinions on these features :
Disc 1 :
  -Intrwooooo
Harley Race - not that great for me
Dusty Rhodes Starrcade - I like Dusty's charisma but watchign him wrestle isn't that fun. But the events leading up to are pretty good.
Barry Windham - did not enjoy this part much
Disc 2 - as you read I did not like the first disc at all actually but the second and third blew it away.
Ricky Steamboat feud with a match of theirs
Ricky Steamboat WrestleWar - its called their best match together
Terry Funk I Quit Match - I enjoyed this part, really entertaining
Disc 3 -maybe my fav disc?
1992 Royal Rumble - Ric Flair walks in no. 3 and wlaks out the new WWE Champion... I'm sorry the Real Worlds Heavyweight Wrestling Champion. Wooo!
v. Sting - goodness
also the may 21st match against Triple H with the post-match tribute to Naitch.
Overall I cannot really name all of the extra features because there really is that many. But newer fans may not really enjoy spending 10.5 watching this, honestly I fast-forwarded some 60minute matches but it still is the best WWE has ever released onto WWE.",1075939200,,1543,4.4416961130742045
1925197,5,B0000DIJOW,"Wow.
That is about the quickest way to describe this boxed set.
Ric Flair is easily the best all around wrestler to ever lace up a pair of boots, and this boxed set shows why.  From his wars with guys like Harley Race, Terry Funk, and Ricky Steamboat to his more recent years in the WWE, this set covers every inch of it.
Whoever worked on this set for WWE deserves a raise.  This is the best use yet of the footage that they own now to date.  The set seems so complete in covering Flair's great work (unlike the more recent Mick Foley set, which is lacking some important material).
I found some of the navigation to be a little unclear, and I wish there was more than just one match with Steamboat in what is easily one of my all time favorite wrestling feuds, but even these things cannot make me give this set less than 5 stars.
Awesome stuff for a very great price.  A must own for ANY wrestling fan of any age.",1075593600,,916,4.15819209039548
1925208,3,B0000DIJOW,"Ric Flair was the man.  I was never a big Flair fan.  But to be fair to Flair, I bought the set and was pleasantly surprised.
The DVD set itself is classic.  It crams as much information into a three DVD set as it could, and we still need part 2 & 3.  Flair had incredible rivalries with Dusty Rhoades, Ricky Steamboat, Harly Race, and Sting.  I remember watching them with great anticipation when I was younger.  However, one match each, is just not enough.
Really, after watching this, the only question I was left with, was why does someone who has accomplished everything still compete?  Shouldn't he have moved into retirement by now?  Or is the WWE in such dire circumstances, that they need Flair to perform?",1075248000,,715,4.53125
1925209,5,B0000DIJOW,"First things first, it's nearly impossible to fault most of the match selection on this disc.  6 of the main 8 matches are true classics.  Of the other two, it's totally understandable why Dusty Rhodes is on here, because of how long Flair and Rhodes feuded.  The only real question mark is the Sting/Flair match from 1994.  It's an alright 17 minute match, but they tease us by including the final minute of their 1987 45 minute classic.
Nonetheless, by all means, buy this DVD.  The best U.S. Heavyweight ever.  Then, hope for volume 2.
Still out there:  Flair/Steamboat from New York in 1983.  Flair/Steamboat from Chigaco in 89.  The aforementioned Flair/Sting classic from 87.  Flair/Savage from Wrestlemania 8 in 1992, in Indiana.  Flair's title matches with Kerry Von Erich.  The Flair/Vader 93 match.  Anything post 1994.",1075075200,,829,4.963503649635037

There is a ton of extras like Flair's debut match at Madison Square Garden, Confidential reports about Flair's plane crash, two stories about the Four Horsemen, and the night the WWE paid tribute to Flair on RAW in Greenville, SC.

I really hope to see more like this.

SONOFAGUN!"" I can't help but smile.  Ric Flair has dedicated over half of his life to professional wrestling; this DVD set is a rightful tribute to him, and fans will appreciate it.
Among my favorite aspects of the Collection are:
1.  His rivalry with Dusty Rhodes.  Classic ""Good Guy vs. Bad Guy"" wrestling at its best.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Flair discuss the huge respect he has for ""the American Dream"" (and for all of the opponents highlighted in this collection) and how exhilarated he felt from their matches.
2.  The Promos!  Nobody gives a better promo than ""Slick Ric.""  Arrogant.  Cocky.  Full of himself.  I loved 'em all.
3.  The Four Horseman.  A true gem, Ric Flair, Ole Anderson, Arn Anderson, and Tully Blachard, with James ""J.J."" Dillon as the manager, constituted wrestling's original first family.  I always derived a sick vicarious pleasure in listening to their bragadocious promos.
One of Ric Flair's famous sayings is ""To be the man, you've gotta beat the man.""  Ric Flair was, is and will always be, the man.  For any professional wrestling fan, this Collection is a must-have.

1925213,5,B0000DIJOW,My goodness what a great DVD I got this baby on sale at FYE in Orland Park Mall day after Christmas on sale for only 27 bucks with tax.  And you know what that was well worth my money because of the fact that I am a huge Ric Flair fan and a huge fan of all of his success.  I almost met the man at my very first pay per view in 1994 at Rosemont Horizon at the now defunct WCW during Spring Stampede.  He was wrestling at the time Ricky The Dragon Steamboat.  Some people say in their reviews on line that this DVD did Ric Flair no justice well they are wrong in some areas yes it did no justice for the Sting feature in this tape because one person said that they did not show one of Flairs greatest matches against Sting and that was at the very first Clash of Champions in 1989.  This match was a very incredible contest that yours truly witnessed on TV that very day.  It was a great battle that ended in a 45 minute draw and they had to decide it by a judges decision and two of the judges voted both ways one for Sting one for Flair and the last judge voted no contest whice ment that the match was a draw and Ric Flair retained the NWA World Championship but on that day Sting got the better of a older but wiser Ric Flair.  But on the other had the DVD did Flair some justice and well deserved.  The Steamboat piece was very cool.  They showed the Clash of Champions 6 match between them from the Superdome in New Orleans and that was an incredible match.  Flair had Steamboat going for a while won the first fall Flair was up 1-0 then Steamboat came out softened Flairs shoulder up and then he put Flair in the Chicken Wing hold and won the second fall by submission and evened up the match at 1 apiece third fall was nip and tuck back and forth. Flair putting Steamboat in his Figure Four leg lock and hurting Steamboat badly but then Steamboat again finished Flair off with the Chicken Wing and he dropped down to a pinning prediciment and won the match 2-1 in over 55 minutes but Doug Dillinger at the time head of NWA told Ricky Steamboat that Flair had his foot on the outside of the ring which would of caused a break by offical Tommy Young but he did not see the foot outside the ring but only saw Flairs shoulders to count the 123.  Flairs lawyers ordered the NWA to grant Flair a Rematch for the NWA Championship at the next pay per view which was WrestleWar 89 in Memphis Tennessee at the Municiple Auditourium.  In turn the match took place and Flair became the 6 time World Heavyweight Champion.  Then the thing that was so cool was the Flaired up version of the night he truly and so richly deserved.  The night when all of the Raw superstars came out and gave Flair the night of dedication he so desrvently needed and got it.  Overall the DVD is excellent and very true to its word.  Yeah maybe he needs another DVD to get more of his match but for now this DVD does him some great justice that he so richly deserves.  WOOO,1073347200,2,2945,4.13859649122807
1925214,5,B0000DIJOW,"For all of the negative (and there is a lot) that can be said about the WWE having a virtual monopoly on the wrestling business in the U.S. since the acquisition of WCW in 2001,  "" The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" DVD is proof that at least some positive came out of it. Having the rights to much of Ric Flair's footage from the past 25+ years gave the WWE the ability to put together this great DVD package, featuring 10.5 hours of classic matches, interviews, angles and feuds from Ric Flair's career
The oldest match on the DVD is Flair's rarely seen WWWF Madison Square Garden debut in 1976 against Pete Sanchez, with the play-by-play announcing handled by a very young Vince McMahon. The collection primarily features Flair's matches against famous foes like Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Rick Steamboat, Terry Funk, Barry Windham and Sting.  A nice feature of the DVD is that instead of only providing footage of the matches themselves without any backhistory, each chapter of the DVD also contains the angles and interviews that led up to each historic confrontation.
The access to footage from different wrestling territories where Flair has worked provides for an interesting wrestling history lesson. For example, in the chapter where Flair comes to the WWF in 1991 there are angles and interviews shown that lead to a Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper feud. Viewers can then contrast this with an angle from nearly a decade earlier from the Mid-Atlantic territory that also led to a Flair vs. Piper feud. As many current wrestling fans are aware, Flair is currently part of the ""Evolution"" group in the WWE, which also includes twenty-something Randy Orton. Viewers of this DVD collection will get the opportunity to see the 1983 angle where Orton's father, Bob Orton, Jr. tries to collect a $25,000 bounty put up by Harley Race to whoever could force Flair out of wrestling.
One of my favorite parts of the DVD were the many hidden ""Easter Eggs"" of classic Flair interviews from the TBS ""World Championship Wrestling"" show from the 80s. The DVD also has sections discussing Flair's near career ending plane crash in 1975 as well as the history of the Four Horseman (featuring current interviews with both Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard). The ""Day in the Life of a Horseman"" feature was great! Hearing Blanchard and Anderson tell it, the TV portrayal of the Horseman as ""limousine riding, lear jet flying"" partiers was not all that far from their real lifestyle at the time. The stories about their wild escapades were very entertaining.
The ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" has so much great stuff within its 3 discs that to complain seems almost petty. But Ric Flair is one of those rare performers where even a 10.5 hour collection of the ""Best of"" his career leaves the viewer with the feeling that too much good stuff was left out. I would have loved to have seen his Starrcade `93 match with Vader included and would have also liked to have seen more of Flair's older, rarer footage from Mid-Atlantic Wrestling from the late 70s (I'm assuming the WWE has the rights to this footage). The only real odd choice to include in the collection is Flair's 1994 match with Sting. Sting and Flair had many classic battles; I'll never understand why the only Flair vs. Sting match included is one of their least famous. I would have rather they included their 1988 Match of the Year from the first ever Clash of the Champions. I guess what I'm saying is, while I give ""The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" my highest recommendation, it appears there is more than enough footage not included on the three discs for an equally extensive Volume II, which I sincerely hope they come out with",1073260800,6,3684,4.7727272727272725
1925215,5,B0000DIJOW,"The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection is a fantastic DVD from beginning to end and is by far the best wrestling DVD ever released. The WWE did a great job including some of his greatest NWA/WCW matches and promos. The chapters are all chronological covering The Nature Boy's greatest rivalries. Flair also discusses each chapter of the disc praising the outstanding abilities of his opponents.
Disc 1 covers his feuds with Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, and Barry Windham. What's interesting to note here is how effective Race and Rhodes were at telling a story not only in the ring but also in their promos. Race's promos are priceless, he sounds like a stone-cold killer here. Rhodes plays the common man to the hilt in his promos, one of the best talkers ever in wrestling. The matches included here with Race, from Starcade '83, and Rhodes, from  Starcade '85, are both very good. Race was slow and methodical in the ring but nonetheless the tension put forth from both competitors speaks volumes. Rhodes, while not the most talented wrestler, more than makes up for it with his charisma. Flair is classic playing the heel here. Flair's match with Barry Windham is the best on the disc truly showing that Windham, while not one to give great promos, was certainly one of the most talented wrestlers to enter the squared circle.
But while Disc 1 is great, Disc 2 is pure gold. This disc is comprised of his spectacular feuds with Ricky Steamboat and Terry Funk from '89. Both Steamboat matches included are still considered among the best matches of all time. If two wrestlers were meant to compete with another, Flair and Steamboat were them. The action in both matches is breathtaking and are great chapters in skill, heart, and conditioning. Then after Flair defeats Steamboat at WrestleWar, it leads right into Terry Funk's sneak attack which leads to the Funk chapter. Although this chapter is short, containing some great promos and the ""I Quit"" Match, it shows both competitors'  great brawling tactics and amazing ability to withstand punishment. There are also great segments here detailing the plane crash which injured Flair's back and with the Four Horsemen featuring excellent analysis from original members Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson.
Disc 3 begins with Flair's biggest WWE triumph, his Royal Rumble victory in '92, in which he lasted over 1 hour over such now wrestling legends as Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Randy Savage, Shawn Michaels, and many others. At age 42, this was a great testament to Flair's endurance and cardio-vascular conditioning and remains the best Royal Rumble in the company's history. The Sting chapter is also very good, showing Flair's title unification victory in '94. Although Flair and Sting had better matches than the one presented here, it's still a great match showing how well they worked together. Finally, the chapter entitled ""A Special Night In Greenville"" is excellent, showing some rarely seen footage such as his WWE debut match in '76 and the special celebration for Flair after his match with HHH on Raw, a perfect way to end the disc. The WWE should strongly consider making a Volume 2 for Ric Flair. Although this collection delivers the goods, he had many other strong rivalries not included here with Randy Savage, Bret Hart, Roddy Piper, the Road Warriors, and Lex Luger to name a few. There's also plenty of material available in the NWA/WCW library to make a separate DVD for the Four Horsemen as well. Highly recommended to all wrestling fans.",1073174400,4,3506,4.930626057529611

It includes the storylines and promos leading up to some of his biggest matches against Ricky Steamboat, Sting, Barry Whindam, Dusty Rhodes, and includes, for the first time ever, exclusive uncensored footage of his 1991 invasion of the WWF with the NWA (WCW) belt in hand. While the belt was shown on TV on his debut appearance, it was digitized out in future telecasts but now the footage is restored.

1925230,5,B0000DIJOW,"You begin your review of the Ric Flair DVD by addressing the customers who may potentially purchase the DVD as ""wrasslin'"" fans.  These reviews are intended for wrasslin' fans as a medium through which they are able to make decisions about purchasing the DVD.  Wrasslin' fans have no desire to be harangued by someone who has been indubitably been scarred for life by his exposure to Professional Wrasslin'.  He has articulated his scorn for the effects of his exposure to Wrasslin' very well, but I find nothing in his comments that exhibit Wrasslin' as anything but a form of artistic expression.  If this individual were truly a fan of Wrasslin' prior to being edified by his exposure to reading, he probably had the qualifications that he cited as being those of a Wrasslin' fan.  He is merely unshackling the demons of Wrasslin' because they have malformed his entire existence, but he does not make a single valid statement about why Wrasslin' is poisonous to America.  Wrasslin' may appeal to the younger audiences and the uneducated and uninspired individuals of America, but the works of William Shakespeare also appealed to the lower classes during his time.  The works of Shakespeare were riddled with scences of obscenity and debauchery because his works provided his audience with an escapism form of entertainment/art.  Do not feel shamed or rueful about a past or current interest with Wrasslin'.  Wrasslin' reflects the conditions of our society and the yearnings of a society to escape into a world of what is ultimately illustrating the struggle between good versus evil.  Excluding the lascivious language and promotions of rebellion and violence, Professional Wrasslin' reflects the longing of a society to escape from the rigors of life.  Some may escape through literature and other forms of artistic expression, and others may satiate their longings for such escape through Professional Wrasslin'.  Wrasslin' is nothing more than a reflection of the sinful nature of our society, but it is ultimately a depiction of the struggle between good and evil in an entertaining format.  I sincerely hope that Professional Wrasslin' has not completely scarred the existence of EZEKIEL.  Wrasslin' may be predetermined and staged (""Fake""), but the artistic expression remains the same.  EZEKIEL, please do not respond with a citation of my gramatical errors littered throughout this review because you must remember that I belong to the uneducated.",1072137600,2,2461,5.19493670886076
1925231,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is actually the first DVD that I have ever purchased. I am a lifelong Ric Flair fan and have 6 different volumes of his best matches I edited together on my own over the years. Ric Flair has had so many great matches, moments and rivals, so it is always hard to put together a retrospective. WWE hit the money on this one. They do indeed include some of his best ever matches such as the famous 1 hr match with Barry Windham and the best ever 5-7-89 Flair-Steamboat, but they also have many rare promos that I have never seen nor own.
For me one of the things that caught my eye right away was the whole aftermath of the Flair-Dusty Starrcade 85'. I had always thought this was a great match except it was sold as if Dusty won the title, when in fact the decision was overturned. I never could find the footage of it being overturned and JCP irresponsibly sold it as if Dusty won the title after having months to edit it releasing the same lie on the video in 1985. On this DVD the entire aftermath of that controversy is discussed. I could never find that before and this as well as so many other things that are on there.
Not to jump the gun, but with Ric Flair there are so many other great moments and I hope in time Vince McMahon will consider a second DVD. 10.5 hours would be a lot with another wrestler but not with the 60 minute man. They could produce 12 DVD set and still have plenty to go with Ric Flair. I hope they release his autobiography by the summer and don't push it back anymore.
All Flair fans, this DVD is a must! You will enjoy it! I don't want to sound like a cheap promo but if there is ever one DVD you should buy it is the Ric Flair DVD.",1072051200,,1670,4.094512195121951

I grew up watching wrestling, discussing wrestling, going to wrestling and miss the days of different regions having their own feuds with heels and babyfaces. So seeing the old NWA, and Mid Atlantic and WWWF brought it all back.  If anybody in your family loved wrestling ""back in the day,"" then this is a must have DVD.

1925235,5,B0000DIJOW,"The Ric Flair DVD is probably the best DVD put out by WWE. One of the advantages of the WWE's buying WCW is that they can now release DVDs that cover an entire wrestlers career. Here is my list of the what is good about this DVD and what is bad.
The Good....
1. Ric Flair vs. Barry Windham---I was pretty surprised that this was included. I thought I was the only one who remembered their match from World Wide Wrestling. The fact that most of the unscheduled set up match from the previous week is included is an extra bonus. I searched for a long time to find a copy of this World Wide Wrestling 45:00 draw match on VHS. That it is on this DVD is just great.
2. Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat---Great choice again. The 2 out of 3 falls match and the match where Flair regains the title were great. The set up match from the show that would eventually be called WCW Saturday Night (Eddie Gilbert and Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair and Barry Windham) was a nice inclusion as well.
3. Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk---Decent enough match that is worth having on the DVD because it ended the feud between Flair and Funk. It would also not be long before Ric Flair would fall back into his role as heel.
4. Royal Rumble---This was another great performance by Flair. WWE wasn't used to having wrestlers who could wrestle for an hour, so they took advantage of it when they finally got one. You get to see Flair in brief confrontations with people you normally wouldn't in WWE (example: Kerry Von Erich). Ric Flair giving a brief explanation of why he left WCW and how he got to take the old WCW title belt with him for a while were also great.
5. A Special Night in Greenville---The Ric Flair vs. HHH match was short, but it showed that Ric Flair can still put on a great match. If you have read about or seen the post match tribute, you know it just has to be seen.
The Bad...
1. Ric Flair vs. Sting---I can only assume that they chose this match because it was one of the few televised Flair vs. Sting matches that Flair won. It would have been better to include either their first match at Clash of the Champions (probably their best match) or their match at the Great American Bash where Sting won the title for the first time (probably their biggest and most hyped match).
2. Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat---You have the set up match...You have the first re-match...You have the match where Flair regains the title...Why not include the first match where Steamboat wins the title at Chi-Town Rumble?
3. Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk---Same as Steamboat...Why not include their first match from Baltimore (the post match brawl between Flair/Sting vs. Funk/Muta last a long time and is great.)
4. WWE logo---Why do you insist on putting the WWE logo in the corner of stuff that you didn't do. Just because you own it now doesn't mean you had anything to do with putting the matches together.
My final comment is: I want more!! We need a volume 2. We need Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger from WrestleWar in which Luger gives up the title to save Sting. We need War Games: the Match Beyond. We need Ric Flair vs. Jimmy Garvin in a cage. We need Ric Flair vs. Magnum T.A. What I am saying is that we need a lot more. Thanks WWE for releasing this DVD...please give us some more.",1071014400,4,3254,4.353618421052632
1925236,5,B0000DIJOW,"It just goes to show that after thirty years, a true performer can be showcased in the way that they deserve.  The very fact the Flair is as relevant today as he was 10 or 15 years ago is amazing in its own right.  However, what makes this collection a musthave are the promos that the man makes.  I've never seen as much passion and conviction (all apologies to Mick Foley) in a spot then these.
Ric Flair is a man's man!",1070928000,2,422,4.121951219512195
1925237,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is it! The price is resonable for over 10 hours of wrestling by the the man. All the early stuff you can imagine. Some of the commentary is great. Especialy when talking of leaving the NWA for the WWF with the NWA belt in tow. The match with HHH is ok but the tribute paid to him after the show. Shows how respected he is. The early days with Dusty,Garvin and Race brings back memories. Flairs first match. This shows how cocky he was going to be.",1070841600,7,452,4.1477272727272725
1925248,5,B0000DIJOW,"This DVD sets a new standard for WWE releases, and hopefully will be followed up on with DVD sets for some more of the legendary stars of wrestling, such as Bret Hart, Randy Savage, Mick Foley etc. It's great to see some of the old footage, most of which I have never seen before, and the stuff I have seen is nowhere near the same crystal clear picture quality as it is on this DVD set. Recommended to all wrestling fans, young and old, educate yourselves with the work of one of the greatest entertainers of all time, a legend equal to the likes of Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Shakespeare & Mozart, the one & only Limousine riding, jet flying, kiss stealin', wheelin' dealin son of a gun, the one and only Nature Boy Ric Flair! Whoooooo!",1070841600,,739,4.401459854014599
1925249,5,B0000DIJOW,"Hardcore Flair fans like me are going to always expect more, because we have so many memories of the man, I just beg the WWE brass to at least bring out a Volume II and at least cover some of his feuds with Greg Valentine, Wahoo McDaniel, The Brisco Brothers, Roddy Piper, Jimmy Garvin, Andre the Giant, Lex Luger, Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Vader, Nikta Koloff, as well as some footage of his feud with the Hollywood Blonds, Arn Anderson and some footage of his AWA days and his beginning in the NWA, and if they have it I request his match with the other Nature Boy, the legendary Buddy Rogers and the match in North Korea when he faced Antonio Inoki. Some footage between him and Bob Backlund, Sgt. Slaughter, and Bret Hart would of been cool.  New school wrestling fans just need to know.
Now on with this superb DVD.
My personal favorite is the Harley Race segment. I think fans of the Attitude and Sports Entertainment era need to pay extra attention here, as it clips show how well both Flair and Race sold this feud, and how well the build up to their classic match at Starcade 83 was done. And for those who asks, who's Harley Race and what's the big fuss, this should answer all those questions.
The Dusty Rhodes section brought back a lot of memories, because it was around that time I began watching the NWA. I really miss watching Dusty, he wasn't much to look at, but he was very mobile for a guy his size and so charasmatic, you forgot he was say, a big fat guy. Flair-Rhodes feud in the mid 80's made me the wrestling junking I am today.
The Barry Windham section was a shocker, but I am more than happy they added it on. Totally agree with Flair when he stated Windham never got his due. Flair-Windham war was a treat in early 87, I was disappointed that their payoff match at the Corckett Cup 87, wasn't added.
Ricky Steamboat, well nuff said here. Any Flair-Steamboat War is worth watching, whether it's from the 70's, 80's, or 90's.
Terry Funk section could have been more detailed, but no complaints here.
Flair's WWE then WWF run from 91-93 was highlighted by the Royal Rumble, most clips are from his arrival leading up to the Rumble and after the Rumble.
The Sting section was a disappointment to me, only because there were better matches they had than the one they chose. Their classic 45 minute match at the first Clash of the Champions should have been on this DVD, but I guess the brass are saving it for something better. However the clips were priceless.
Then we have his Madison Square Garden debut where Naitch looked a lot younger and not so polished as he was later on, but he had just recovered from that plane crash as well. The tribute in Greenville, SC is covered, as well as other spots, including the Confidential segments on the Horsemen & The plane crash (disc 2) and a funny workout that included Roddy Piper (disc 3).
This is a must have for any wrestling fan. Woooooo!!!!!!",1070496000,16,2918,4.4440298507462686
1925250,5,B0000DIJOW,"I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD and I have not been disappointed.  Whether you're a Ric Flair fan or not, this DVD is a must-own.  WWE did an excellent job with this.  Being a die-hard Flair fan, I would have included all of his title victories (some of which are hard to find - e.g., vs. Kerry von Ehrich in Japan and vs. Harley Race in Singapore).  All in all, it is the prize DVD set in my collection.",1070496000,,427,4.0476190476190474
1925251,5,B0000DIJOW,"I am not even done watching the whole DVD (I am on the third disc), and it is the best wrestling DVD I have ever seen.  The production is top notch, and if you grew up watching Flair do his thing in the 80's like me, you have to get this.  It was like re-living my childhood.  Flair's ring work, and mic work are just awesome.  He even makes watching Dusty Rhodes bearable.  By watching this, you will also remember how great Barry Windham and Ricky Steamboat were.  I can't wait for a second volume.",1070496000,,500,4.2105263157894735
1925252,5,B0000DIJOW,"This is probably the best WWE DVD there is, only because it is full of stuff. The Royal Rumble match from 92 is what I consider to be the best Rumble ever. Flair vs Steamboat from Wrestlewar many call the best match of all time. I would have liked to see Flair vs Vader, Flair vs Nikita Koloff, Flair vs Magnum TA, Flair vs Hogan and Flair vs Piper on this DVD set but all that means is that they can do a volume 2.",1070064000,,415,3.8941176470588235

1925255,4,B0000DIJOW,"This is a very good set at which to get a glimpse into one of, if not the most, prolific careers in all of  professional wrestling. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair is widely considered to be the best wrestler of the last quarter century, and rightfully so. This set allows new and older fans alike to witness many historic moments in the career of the Nature Boy, as well as gain insight into the background of legendary feuds and matches as Flair introduces each segment with his own candid comments. This production is undoubtedly the best DVD set the WWE has put out in quite awhile (though the ""Bloodbath: Wresting's Greatest Steel Cage Matches"" DVD comes in at a close second).
As much as I hate to admit it, I cannot give ""The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" perfect rating as it is far from the ""ultimate"" Ric Flair. As mentioned before, this is a WWE-produced DVD. That beckons the question as to why some of Flair's most significant WWE matches left off of this set. A few WWE matches that are inexcusably absent from this compilation include the match against Randy Savage from WrestleMania XIII (1992)as well as the ""Loser Leaves Town"" match with Curt Hennig from an early episode of RAW (1993). There are also noticable continuity gaps in the NWA/WCW side. For starters, the entire time between late 1994 and early 2001 is not even hinted at. Sure, those years obviously weren't the best of times for Flair, both inside and outside of the ring, but they should have still been represented in some form or another. Flair's promo from the now-infamous final Monday Nitro (2001) is shown in its entirety, but not the proceeding match with Sting. Speaking of which, the first Clash of the Champions (1988) match with Sting is also M.I.A as is their battles over the world title in the early 90's. This set does contain footage of the angle building to the latter series of events, but alas, it never comes to fruition.  Instead of classic Flair/Sting, we are treated to their 1994 Clash of the Champions encounter. By then, the embers had cooled considerably when it came to that feud. Kind of like day-old pizza; still good, but not as good as when it was first delieverd.
Flair's matches with Lex Luger, Kerry Von Erich, Jimmy Garvin, and Vader should have also been highlighted if only to better illustrate how Flair has the uncanny ability to take a below-average wrestler and make them look like a million bucks. There is no mention of Flair's encounters with a then very un-Stone Cold ""Stunning"" Steve Austin or any subsequent mention of the accompanying feud between the Four Horsemen and the Hollywood Blonds.  Flair's brief, but noteworthy 1995 feud with fellow Horseman Arn Anderson was certainly conspicuous by its absence as I am sure Flair would have had alot to say about the going-ons during that time.
In closing, this is indeed a very good DVD set that was well worth the price of admission, but did not quite live up to the hype. Nevertheless, all the matches and angles are still as  every bit of exciting as they were then they originally came to pass years ago. This set showcases Flair in his prime when compared to the fact that he has sadly been played off as nothing more than Triple H's gopher on WWE TV as of late.  There are countless times when you will be watching this DVD set and say to yourself (or out loud), ""Hey, I remember that!!"".
This DVD set will definately bring back some memories. However, many die-hard Flair fans and many older fans will be left with a sick feeling as they think of what all was NOT included on this 3 disc set.  Here's hoping for a follow up Flair DVD soon with the aforemenioned criminally absent matches and angles included.",1069804800,6,3687,4.629969418960244
1925256,5,B0000DIJOW,"First off, if you hate Ric Flair and this DVD, you have absolutely no right calling yourself a wrestling fan. Any TRUE fan you have to appreciate the true art of wrestling and promos. Well, Nature Boy Ric Flair is the man to teach you that very fine art and it's WHOO! right here in this DVD set. I grew up watching Flair in the WWF when I was a little kid and saw some of his WCW stuff in the 90s. Last few years, I have collected his classics from the NWA and he is surpassing Randy Savage as my all time favorite wrestler. If you think I am a mark just because of what I'm sayin, then I laugh at you as YOU are the mark who doesn't understand what the business is all about. Any smart mark knows who the greatest of all time is and it's Ric Flair.
Disc 1
This covers his big match at Starrcade 83 with Race as well as the feud. Also on it are the Starrcade 85 Match and feud with Rhodes. The Flair-Race match was an easy ****1/2 star match. Rhodes has never been a good wrestler, but he could talk on the mic real well. I felt Flair carried him to a *** star match, but the lame Dusty finish hurt the overall match itself in the long run as it felt like it was all a pointless match. For those that don't know what a Dusty finish is, he was a booker for the NWA and he was famous for having big title matches at huge events (ie Clash, Great American Bash, Starrcade) end in controversy and always have a decision reversed. The only thime it worked well was in Disc 2 and you will see why. Final Match on here was Flair vs Barry Windham in a definite *****star match. Just absolutely perfect wrestling in that one. The first disc was excellent. It covers the early years of Flair, but I was a little disappointed that we didn't get more into his feud with Luger in 88 as well as maybe some classics that he had in Japan.
Disc 2
This disc right here is the main reason to buy it! 3 fabulous matches and if you don't like them, then you can go and take your markish little beliefs and stick where the sun doesn't shine. Flair vs Steamboat from Clash of the Champions VI is my all time fav. match in their series. It was an easy *****star match and here the Dusty finish WORKS! You have the match end in controversy, which leads to a blowoff match between the two for WrestleWar 89. What does that mean? Another nice match for all to see WHOO! I consider Clash VI the Greatest match of all time. It was 55 or 56 minutes long, but people it has PSYCHOLOGY galore! Headlocks are used as pinning combinations! Not for resting like horrendeous wrestlers such as the Mark Henrys, Steiners or whoever use them today. Chopfests are always MUCH BETTER than slugfests. They are realistic! They are stiff and it feels like a war! Wrestle War 89 is considered the greatest match ever. Hard to argue that one as I love it as well. It is a *****star match all the way. It had the perfect angle afterwards with Flair and Funk which lead to the 3rd match on this disc. Flair-Funk Clash IX was the stiffest match I have ever seen. A classic and it has to be seen to be appreciated. Yeah Funk's piledrivers were lame, but it didn't hurt the match as a whole as it was another *****star match. This disc is my favorite of the 3, but there are some things that I wish were on it. They clipped the Flair/Windham vs Steamboat/Eddie Gilbert match. WHY?!?! I have that match in its entirety and it is an easy ****3/4 match. I also wish they included Flair-Steamboat from Chi-Town Rumble 89. That was another ***** star match that had to be on here to really show why their series ruled.
Disc 3
I loved this one a lot because I grew up watching the WWF Ric Flair. I can remember him when I was a kid and how I rooted for Piper and Hogan to destroy him. Royal Rumble 92 is the greatest Rumble ever at ***** stars. All action, eliminations were timed perfectly, the dead weight was in and out at perfect times. There was always an interesting thing going on in the ring. Heenan's commentary made it all the more fun to watch. Then we have Sting vs Flair from Clash XXVII. An easy ****star match. Fabulous wrestling, even if Sting's title didn't mean squat. Then there's the tribute. I got goosebumps seeing it and it was a classy thing done by the WWF (I REFUSE TO CALL IT BY IT'S CURRENT NAME!). Triple H vs Flair was **1/2 as Triple H is not as good as he was in 2000-2001. Flair's debut vs Pete Sanchez in 1976 is something to see. It was **1/2 as well. I wish they showed some rare Flair-Hogan and Flair-Piper matches on this one so people could get a sense that those feuds had blowoffs to them.
Despite some things left out, this is a great set. This helps newer fans learn of Flair and wrestlings past and what the NWA was like. Get it and see why wrestling from the 80s and early 90s will always be better than the soap opera stuff you see today. Promos and wrestling had art back then. Now it's nothing more than stupid hollywood knockoffs as it's all scripted talk and less wrestling.",1069718400,6,4967,4.2075471698113205
1925267,5,B0000DIJOW,"This was a wonderful, wonderful DVD that captured why ""Slick Ric"" is the greatest wrestler today.  Any true wrestling fan must have this DVD.
The matches with Steamboat, Rhodes, Funk and the history of The Four Horseman brought back ALOT of memories of wrestling in the '80's.
Because of Hogan and the WWF machine, Flair didn't get his proper due, this DVD should do just that.",1069718400,,377,4.712121212121212
1925268,5,B0000DIJOW,"It was said that in his heyday, Ric Flair could carry a broomstick to a three-star match.  Apparently, the same holds true for a WWE DVD.
After a series of substandard releases, the WWE hit paydirt with this sprawling collection, chronicling some of Ric Flair's highest-profile feuds.  Instead of focusing entirely on Flair's time with the WWE, the bulk of the DVD set focuses on Flair's time in the Mid-Atlantic territory.  Instead of glossing over the feuds with selected highlights, full matches are shown.  Bonus footage on the DVD covers most of the background, providing full promos, clips from the NWA's flagship TV programs, and dressing room interviews.  As Ric Flair was the NWA's highest profile wrestler through the 1980's, this comes off as much as a history of the NWA as it does a career retrospective.
Included on the DVD are some of Flair's best matches - two against Ricky Steamboat from 1989, a one-hour match against Barry Windham that aired on NWA World Wide Wrestling in 1987, Flair's 1992 Royal Rumble victory, and an ""I Quit"" match against Terry Funk.  Interspersed throughout are some of Flair's best promos, and Flair himself providing commentary to set up the matches.  For the most part, however, Flair steps aside and lets the action do most of the talking.
As much material as this provides, there is still enough material to perhaps justify a second volume of Flair highlights - his 1987 title win over Ron Garvin is covered on another WWE DVD title (""Bloodbath""), his 1988 feud with Lex Luger is ignored entirely, the first match of the 1989 Steamboat-Flair trilogy (where Steamboat ends Flair's fifth World title reign) is mysteriously absent save for a few clips, and there is very little of Flair in the 1990's, ignoring matches with Vader, Eddie Guerrero, and Hulk Hogan.  But as it stands, this is still a must-own DVD, and a worthy addition to any wrestling fan's collection.",1069545600,2,1913,4.882716049382716

I have had the pleasure of meeting and getting to hang out with The Road Warriors, Sting, Ricky Morton etc. TRUE Old School wrestling is the REAL WRESTLING!!! This 3 disc cd of Flair was MAGNIFICENT! I watched it one night and got up the next morning and watched it again. If you want to be entertained by the GREATEST NWA Champion ever then - this is it. I can only hope that The Dragon will get a dvd set together for the fans. Ric Flair the greatest bad guy and Steamboat the greatest babyface. I loved their feuds and the stamina wrestling an hour is surely missed nowadays where everything is interference, maybe go to 20 minutes and is all about T&A and who has power with the creative team.

This set is chop full of material! I am in awestruck at the sheer amount of footage, matches, and interviews from Flairs career jam packed on this set. I have wanted a DvD like this for so long and I can't believe how incredible it is. Whole hour long matches including ring intrances and many times before and after match interviews. All the interviews and skirmishes with foes that lead up to his biggest matches.
The best part for me was some of the footage of the original 4 horsemen. I grew up watching the horsemen dominate the NWA and have always felt that the 80's NWA was the best wrestling that ever was. They even have the time the Horsemen broke Dusty Rhoads legs. I still remember how upset that made me when i was a kid!
Now that Vince owns every major wrestling company that ever was, you can put together a complete career DvD like this regardless if a star moved from company to company. I will be looking for future DvD's like this one!
I can not recommend this DvD enough to any wrestling fan! Even if your not a Flair fan, and god knows how you can not be, this is wrestling history. Some of the greatest matches and rivalries ever in wrestling are contained here. Ric Flair will always be my favorite wrestler!

People absolutely loved to hate him.  However, I'm afraid of a WWE spin to this.  Make no mistake about it: Flair made his name before WWF.  I have quite a few of wrestling moments on tape - mostly NWA/WCW stuff.
No one could strut down the aisle like Flair.  The matches with Sting and Steamboat are great (I have these on tape).  I would have like to see Flair against Wahoo McDaniel though.  A moment that i again have on tape (but sadly not on the DVD set) is when Flair says ""The problem with Brian Pillman is that his mouth is bigger than what his a** can empty.""  That just killed me!  Another moment was when Luger and Flair were talking in the ring.  Flair being calm as he always was when talking told Luger, ""Luger, if you get in my face one more time, I'm gonna kick your a**.""
WWE has made Flair into a joke......I'm very sorry for that.  However, from reading the other reviews and the actual DVD contents, this set should be pretty damn good.",1069372800,,1122,4.336538461538462

The buildup for his classic matches with Harley Race, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Terry Funk, Sting, Barry Windham, and the '92 Royal Rumble are all included.
Besides the great matches, they do a sitdown interview with Flair and they discuss his career throughout each disc including his departure from WCW in 1991.
I've been a Flair fan for 15 years and there's a lot of stuff on here that I've never seen before such as many of the lead-in items with the Race match.
Also, there are somewhere between 5-7 easter eggs featuring some of Flair's best promos. Plus, check out the two features on disc 2 involving the Four Horsemen. Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson talk about the history and the lifestyle of the Four Horsemen.
Overall, it's a great DVD that trumps anything the WWE has done before. It makes Hogan's 2-disc DVD set look like child's play.",1068940800,44,1087,4.608247422680412
