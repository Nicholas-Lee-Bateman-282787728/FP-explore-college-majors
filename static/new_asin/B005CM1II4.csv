4653616,4,B005CM1II4,"The dvd came in good time from fun factory and was in great condition. The dvd itself was quite entertaining, the storylines were good and I did enjoy it . If you like goosebumps I think this would be a good dvd to buy especially for younger children like around 2nd grade and up. Hope this helps",1391644800,,296,4.2105263157894735
4653617,3,B005CM1II4,ALl of the Goosebump movies are a little too cheesy for me.  Even my children were really started or filled with fear by these.  Not sure if that a indicator of the fear our children see daily or if Goosebumps really just has lost theirJe ne sais quoi.,1385683200,2,252,4.229166666666667

4653620,5,B005CM1II4,"Here are three more episodes from the 90s Goosebumps series based on the books by R.L. Stine.

In Ghost Beach, there is a 300 year-old ghost living in a cave on the beach.

Cooper Holmes is scared of his own shadow, but now he must deal with a ghost in The Barking Ghost.

Be Careful What You Wish For... has unpopular student Samantha Byrd granted three wishes. These wishes may improve her life, or make her life worse.
