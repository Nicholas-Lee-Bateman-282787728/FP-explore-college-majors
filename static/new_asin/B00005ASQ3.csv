8079067,5,B00005ASQ3,This is a great video series.  I have a 5 and 2 year old and they like this one the best.  The tunes are silly and goofy and they love to sing along.  I even find myself humming the tunes.,1044057600,,188,3.65
8079068,5,B00005ASQ3,"This is a great video!  My 16 month old son loves it, and more importantly, we like it too.  The tunes are catchy, the lyrics are very creative and the kid (actors) are charming!  We have watched this almost every day for the last month and neither my son nor I am bored with it yet!  Since we liked it so much I got some of the other Hap Palmer videos (including the original baby songs video), but so far have been dissapointed with these.",1015200000,,441,4.152941176470589
8079069,5,B00005ASQ3,"My 18 mo old son received this video for Christmas and also has the ""Animals"" video last Christmas.  I can't count how many times he's watched them.  In fact, it's very difficult for me to pull him away from the TV--he cries, points, and stomps his feet when I try to otherwise engage him.  However, with the introduction of these videos, he has started to mimic the children's actions, sing a little, and understands a lot more vocabulary than he picked watching Sesame Street.  Its so cute to watch a toddler touch his toes to his nose.",1010534400,4,538,4.515463917525773
