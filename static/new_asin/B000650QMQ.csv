8038732,2,B000650QMQ,"Director Budd Boettcher, who made a number of solid westerns in the 1950s and early 1960s (several with Randolph Scott, including Buchanan Rides Alone, Seven Men From Now, Decision At Sundown, etc., are among his best) sadly misses the mark here in this 1952 outing. A fine cast led by Robert Ryan and Rock Hudson, along with some great supporting players of the time, including Raymond Burr (who, as usual, makes a good villain), James Arness, Dennis Weaver, and John McIntire, are done in by a pedestrian screenplay (interestingly, although James Arness and Dennis Weaver have no screen time together, they would go on to star together in the classic TV western Gunsmoke). The story of a Confederate major who returns to Texas after the war and looks for easy money (stretching the law, of course) rather than take over his father's ranch has little excitement, save for a couple of confrontations between Burr and Ryan. What should have been a tense father vs. son or brother vs. brother finale simply fizzles. Unless you are interested in seeing an early Rock Hudson effort, give this one a miss.",1340236800,,1100,4.8563829787234045
8038733,4,B000650QMQ,"At the end of the Civil War, two brothers return to their Texas home. But they take wildly divergent paths. One brother (Rock Hudson) is content to work the family farm and settle down. The other (Robert Ryan) has been disillusioned by the war and becomes determined to become wealthy and build an empire, even if it means breaking the law and hurting his own family. It's a decent effectively made horse opera but it lacks the resonance of the great and layered westerns that the director Budd Boetticher made in collaboration with Randolph Scott. Not unusual perhaps but the good characters are a rather nondescript dull lot while the film's two most interesting characters are the bitter, amoral Ryan who'll let nothing get in his way and Julie Adams as the ambitious belle who married for money but finds herself trapped in an unhappy marriage to a cruel tyrant (Raymond Burr). With Dennis Weaver, James Arness, John McIntire, Frances Bavier, Mae Clarke and Rodolfo Acosta.

The Koch Media DVD from Germany is a solid Technicolor transfer in the appropriated 1.33 aspect ratio. Audio is in both English and German.",1326758400,2,1118,4.88421052631579
8038734,3,B000650QMQ,"Horizons West is directed by Budd Boetticher with a story written by Louis Stevens. It stars Robert Ryan, Rock Hudson, Julia Adams, John McIntire, Raymond Burr & Dennis Weaver. It's a Technicolor production with Charles P. Boyle on photography.

It's the end of the Civil War and the Hammond brothers Neal (Hudson) and Dan (Ryan) return to the family ranch in Texas. Neal is happy to graft away on the ranch but Dan wants considerably more. But Dan's plans are altered after an encounter with Cord Hardin (Burr), an encounter that sees Dan switch to the wrong side of the law. A switch that drives a wedge thru the Hammond family, particularly since Neal has decided to don a badge and become a Marshal of Austin.

Interesting and watchable early Western effort from Budd Boetticher. It has some psychological aspects that mark it out as being above average. Themes of greed and family strife are of course nothing new in the grand scheme of the Western movie, but Boetticher and his cast knit them together here with some conviction, notably Ryan who was in the middle of a great run of movies that included On Dangerous Ground, Beware, My Lovely and The Naked Spur. There's no real complexities to the characters, but they are well formed, and the finale has the courage of its convictions. There's also some very neat period costuming from Rosemary Odell, with the quite ravishing Adams benefiting greatly there. The main problematic issues outside of some narrative familiarity come with being asked to believe that Ryan and Hudson (whose limp) are brothers, and that McIntire is Ryan's father (there's only two years between them in reality). Whilst there's sadly a lack of impacting outdoor photography; even if that's off set a touch by the easy on the eye set designs for the town by Russell A. Gausman & Joseph Kish.

A more than adequate time filler for the discerning Western fan. 6/10",1295740800,6,1896,4.809815950920245
8038735,5,B000650QMQ,"This edition of Budd Boetticher's earlier classic, HORIZONS WEST, is in the PAL/European format. It's an excellent transfer, and deserves to be rendered into the US format (NTSC). In the meantime, all regions DVD players are available inexpensively, usually online. With all the foreign DVDs around, it's worth it to purchase one. HORIZONS WEST is an excellent film, and well worth the investment. Recommended.",1249862400,4,410,5.421875
8038736,5,B000650QMQ,"Horizons West is a quite watchable, Budd Boetticher Western. The VHS is fine, and hopefully it will soon be available on DVD. Good acting, very good direction, solid production values.",1236297600,,184,5.166666666666667
