6605019,4,B00MZ3VRX4,"i actually love the real mccoys,my only complaint is that the mouth and the words don't match up on a  lot of the shows....is it only my discs or does anybody else have this problem too????????? it makes it almost unwatchable especially when words are coming out of a closed mouth!!!!!!!!!!! besides that i highly recommend all the real mccoy seasons even season 6 when kate is no longer on the show and lil' luke and hassey are gone too.....",1413331200,5,442,4.525
6605020,1,B00MZ3VRX4,Two copies and still I cannot watch.  Both copies will not play.  There are only 29 episodes in this season and one disc is a reunion of the actors.  That disc plays.  The other 4 discs that the actual episodes are on will not play at all.  Ordered a second copy.  Same thing.  I am now waiting for the third copy.  I hope this one works.  So disappointed.  I've waited so long for season 5 to finally come out.  I will post when copy 3 comes.  It could be an entire batch is defective.,1413158400,6,486,4.053191489361702

6605028,2,B00MZ3VRX4,"Actually I really enjoy The Real McCoys, but as soon as I saw that (although it was digitally remastered), it had no closed-captions or English subtitles, I found I was unable to purchase the shows.  This is really unacceptable in this day and age with the content being from the baby boomer years to begin with.  How uneducated is this?  The ones who would most be inclined to purchase the entire set, are the ones no one cared to cater to!",1414108800,2,441,4.419753086419753
6605029,5,B00MZ3VRX4,"My Real McCoys season 5 discs all play just fine!
Audio & video quality fine.
I have played them all through to confirm the quality. Yes, they are DVD-R's as they have that reddish tint.
As for the mouth of the person speaking and the audio not being in sync, I could not find any major issues with this. Some may be out just a touch, but hardly noticeable.
I have waited so many years to get season 5, and thank SFM for finally making it available.",1414108800,2,449,4.172413793103448
