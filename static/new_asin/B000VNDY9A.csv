8549658,5,B000VNDY9A,"I am a Resource Specialist for the Adult Education Programs in Nevada. By popular student demand, so many teachers want resources for teaching pronunciation to their students. I have used Perfect English Pronunciaton videos in my ESL classes (all levels) and the students and I love them! They are extremely helpful in showing the learner how to pronunciate English sounds. The new DVDs are even better (if that's possible!). I highly recommend ALL of the Perfect English Pronunciation DVDs for anyone who wants to improve their English speaking skills! I am recommending them to all of our ESL teachers!",1197763200,6,604,5.111111111111111
