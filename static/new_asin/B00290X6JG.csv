8357283,2,B00290X6JG,"This DVD contains interviews with Caroline Grierson and Evelyn Shaperot - two very amicable neurofeedback therapists with a pleasant demeanor.  The interview lasts approximately 20 minutes.

I am a certified biofeedback practitioner considering introducing neurofeedback to my practice.

My qualms with this DVD is that at $39.00 I was expecting there to be more information about how to actually work with Alpha/Theta. The DVD does talk about how to make sure the client is ready for such work, what the setting should be like, how to help the client come out of this state, and how to communicate with the client afterwards, but all very shortly.
Putting aside the brevity of the interview, there is no information whatsoever as to how to do the specific work and how to induce the Alpha/Theta state. At this price I would have liked to see some techniques and protocols, and perhaps some script for guided imagery and the induction. And even though there are many different kinds of neurofeedback equipment, the general principle of operating the equipment in this context should be similar, and I feel should have been given in this DVD.

So if you're expecting a hands-on guide as to how to work with Alpha/Theta and how to get good results out of it then I wouldn't recommend purchasing this DVD. On the other hand, if you would like to hear about the experiences of these two pleasant women and learn from their attitude, and if you can afford paying this much for that, then by all means do purchase it.",1249516800,8,1511,4.8
