8754966,5,B01D5MPO7I,"As teenagers, Marshall, Eric, R.J. & Sammi are driving and drinking and get into a near fatal car accident.  As adults, Marshall is a high profile lawyer, Sammi is into finance, Eric has 5 kids by three baby mamas and deep in child support debt and R.J. is a high school basketball coach, who career got derailed by the accident, so he had to play in minor leagues.  Due to some unexpected news, Marshall contacts the three for a reunion, to catch up and TRY to mend fences.  It seems that time is not always on their sides, due to long buried resentments finding their way to the surface, making this reunion tedious at the end.  In the end, all is forgiven by a development I didn't expect, nor did I want to.  A realistic portrayal of how some friendships work when time is not always on your side.  LOVED THIS FLICK!!!",1525737600,,822,4.375
