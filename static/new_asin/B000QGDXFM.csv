I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to immerse their children in a second language and open them to a new world. Wonderful for brain development and... FUN! :)",1282780800,,339,4.573770491803279
8196241,5,B000QGDXFM,"My girls (3 and 5 years old) were captivated by ""Baby China"".  They sat mezmorized through the first viewing.  After several viewings, they began to use Chinese words that they learned.  This video is a unique blend of spoken language and sign language -- it really reinforced the sign language the girls already knew and introduced them to new words in another language.  They loved the songs!",1180915200,4,394,4.835820895522388
8196242,4,B000QGDXFM,"Great concept using Chinese characters, songs, vocabulary, sign language & moving visuals. The audio not so great. The songs too loud and voiceover too soft. You need to sit with your child with remote in hand to turn up when they speak and turn down when it is only music. Overall, a good buy.",1179446400,5,294,4.462962962962963
