8516178,5,B007G2NB7E,Incredible information and very useful.  I hope to attend one of her live seminars in using EMDR to heal attachment wounds.  Her modified protocol has become my standard protocol in trauma therapy.  .,1405468800,,200,5.0
8516179,5,B007G2NB7E,"EMDR is astoundingly rapid and effective for people who have had traumatic experiences of all kinds from natural disasters, car and other accidents, combat trauma, and all types of violence.  Those suffering from complex PTSD rooted in childhood abuse and attachment violations, however, need a more gentle and heavily resourced version of the standard EMDR protocols.  In this DVD Laurel Parnell explains how she adapts and simplifies the implementation of EMDR from the preparation and resourcing to the reprocessing stage and the ways she uses EMDR to strengthen, comfort, and empower the client and help them contain the traumatic material throughout the therapy.  I highly recommend this DVD as an effective and practical resource for all levels of EMDR clinicians. This DVD is especially essential if you work with people who were chronically traumatized in childhood.  The only disappointment is that the demonstration in chapter 3 is from one of the DVDs in the 7 DVD bundle (which is also excellent!) so I had seen it before; at the same time it is exceedingly powerful and good to watch again.",1376438400,2,1103,5.111111111111111
