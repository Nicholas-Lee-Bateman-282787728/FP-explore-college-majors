8449876,5,B004ZJ9VJ8,"it would be nice if they would release it in american langauge and not half japan and half english. like it is now. they need to fix it,  if anybody has it now what until they fix it return for a free complete series.",1311379200,3,217,3.9318181818181817
8449877,1,B004ZJ9VJ8,"How many times are they going to release this?  It's not like its
hard to find, and at a cost of next to nothing (a few bucks).  This is the
third time the original Ultraman series has been released and nothing is being
added to the dvd by doing so.  If you really want this series, get the first
release by BCI Eclipse - they included several large colorful postcards,
English/Japanese soundtrack option, and an episode guide - easily the best
US release of the series so far.  It'd be nice if these companies would at
least wait for the first batch to become scarse before re-re-re-releasing
it again.",1309219200,13,603,4.504587155963303
