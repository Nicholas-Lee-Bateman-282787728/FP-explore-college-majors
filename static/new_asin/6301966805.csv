389676,4,6301966805,"I wish this movie were more widely promoted because I think it has been overlooked.  I also think there should be more Ewok movies made. The Ewoks stand for love of life, family and simple pleasures. A visit to Endor via  movies, is something we all need!  Besides, can anyone resist the immense  cuteness of it all??",937008000,6,317,4.508771929824562
389844,4,6301966805,I received excellent customer service from this seller and the movie arrived to my home in a timely fashion. The outside cover of the movie was in pretty good shape especially considering the age of the VHS. We were able to watch the movies in their entirety and the picture was fine. Unfortunately the sound quality isn't so great. My 7 year old doesn't mind but it's  distracting for me. We do plan to keep the movie and continue watching it b/c we just love the movie.,1403222400,,471,4.413793103448276
389845,3,6301966805,"Arrived exactly as described. Just not as I rmemeber it but I was, like six.",1395100800,,76,4.133333333333334
389846,4,6301966805,"Like many others this movie was one of my all time favorites!! I came on here hoping to find a DVD version. I'm so disappointed there is not one to be found. My husband keeps telling me I'm the only one who must have liked this movie lol Glad to know I'm not alone. My parents still have the one I watched as a child but it's so worn, I'm afraid to play it now. We don't even own a VHS player anymore, so no way to watch this if I did buy it :(",1310256000,,444,3.6842105263157894
389847,3,6301966805,"Brings back lots of memories for me - of watching this with my two 20-something children, when they were younger.  I bought this to now watch my grandchildren and am saving it for them!  Can't wait!",1289088000,,198,4.472222222222222
389848,5,6301966805,"A spin-off of ""Star Wars"", ""The Ewok Adventure"" is a must see! Although this film is geared towards younger audiences, it is still a couch adventure for adults. I recommend that all ""Star Wars"" fans watch this film with their children, as an introduction to the ""Star Wars"" experience.",1102032000,3,285,4.836734693877551
389849,2,6301966805,"this movie is a rather obvious attempt to cash in on the popularity the ewoks gained during the return of the jedi movie.nobody youve ever heard of isin it.but kids don't care,so theyll like it anyway.if you can listen really closely,a ewok cusses,but besides that,there is nothing to warp thier minds.it is not nearly as good as the star wars movies so don't be fooled! at one point a ewok gets killed.this could freak them out.the real deal on this one is that its cute for small children butthats about it.",1089158400,,509,4.604395604395604
389850,5,6301966805,I have seen this movie as a child and I absolutely loved both movies (The Ewok Adventure 1 and 2). I consider this movie a classic like Goonies and Labyrinth! I do hope one day they will release this movie on DVD!,1072396800,2,213,4.095238095238095
389851,5,6301966805,"Oh my god!!  This movie really brought out the imagination in me as a kid.  I was always to make the magic rock in the movie by digging for rocks just like it.  It even inspired me to build a tree house.  This rules!!!!!  By the way, I want it for myself, not kids.",1049241600,,265,3.8333333333333335
389852,5,6301966805,This film was my friend during a very lonely childhood. Oh how I wanted to go live on the moon of endor! The special effects are great and the cast is fun! Chukah trok rules!!!,1046563200,,176,4.057142857142857
389853,5,6301966805,i saw it when i was about 7 so i don't remember all of it but there was some real call bits and it features the ewoks from star wars. YOU JUST HAVE TO LOVE THE EWOKS,1018137600,,165,3.4864864864864864
389931,5,6301966805,"I personally found Ewok Adventure and Battle for Endor really good and funny movies. As says my family.
If there were a way, I'd rate it 1,000 stars",1012608000,,148,4.321428571428571
389932,4,6301966805,"The Ewok Adventure is a very good tv movie, with a decent plot, a good degree of action, some cool monsters (and some cheezy ones) and some good effects (and some terrible ones).  On the downside the acting and dialogue are terrible as are, as previously mentioned, some special effects and some of the creatures.  It's a good but flawed movie, the sequel, ""Ewoks: The Battle for Endor,"" is better.",993859200,2,398,4.671428571428572
389933,1,6301966805,"This 'movie' was awfull!
Take pitiously bad acting, midget  exploitation, and everything bad about the 80's and you'd still have a  better movie.
If there was an option to rate it 0 stars you bet I would.",968457600,,204,4.486486486486487
389934,5,6301966805,"This is a fantastic film which I watched numerous times as a child.  Following the recent success of rerelesing the starwars films and the  making of episode one, to not allow the opportunity  to buy this classic  again is unforgivable. I love ewoks.",966470400,2,250,4.744186046511628
389935,4,6301966805,"I watched this movie many, many times with my sons over the years. They are now 20 and 18, and STILL love this movie! I had a video which I taped from a tv showing several years ago, but it has been viewed so many times  it is completely worn out. Please bring this lovely movie back - I'll  purchase 2 copies on the spot - one for each of my sons to watch with their  future children.",962928000,3,385,3.91025641025641
389936,5,6301966805,"i saw this movie when i was a kid, i loved it particularly because it was a fantasy and it had the starwars feel to it. Since then i was not able to find this video. I hope they make a dvd of this movie. I will be the first  one on the line.",961200000,2,241,3.462962962962963
389937,4,6301966805,"My children really enjoy the Star Wars movies, especially my six-year-old daughter.  We've rented the Ewok Adventure for her and she loves it.  I wish she could have her own copy.",959990400,3,179,4.741935483870968
389938,5,6301966805,I think that the problem with this film is that not enought people know about it (you can see this by the number of reviews it has) I know for a fact that kids would love this film even if they didn't like Star Wars. I  can't really remember anything about the film apart from what my big  brother has told me but I can remember always renting it out. I can only  say one thing BRING IT BACK.,956361600,,392,3.9367088607594938
389939,4,6301966805,"For the longest time I remembered this movie, I knew I had seen it and loved it, but couldn't find it anywhere or find anyone else who remembered it. I finally found it on this sight and was so excited, but disappointed  at the same time because it wasn't available to buy. I hope that in the  very near future it comes up for sale. A definite must for my collection!  :)",950659200,5,371,4.125
7818244,5,6301966805,"WARNING SPOILERS! just recently discovered this gem. i did not know this existed until i looked up george lucas movies. i was lucky that one of the libraries had this movie. these two films tells two stories involving the bear like creatures that we all know and love and it gives wicket two full length films of his own, hey where is the wookie movies. i guess chewbacca was not that popular like these guys are in the second star wars movie or the fifth if ya want to get political. but all in all this was a good find and a great treat they take place right after i want to say return of the jedi. the first movie caravan of courage tells the tale of a star cruise that crashes in endor and parents get took by a monster. the kids get lost and the ewoks find them and nurture the little on cyndil back to health when they find out she is really sick. then the ewoks decide to help the kids find their parents. cyndil and wicket become good friends on the journey. they end up rescuing the parents and everyone becomes friends. and the second movie the battle for endor sees the dad fixing up the star cruiser but a tyrant called terak who thinks that the engine power device is a source of magic and kills cindels dad to get it and destroys the ewok village capturing ewoks and kills mace cindel's brother and her mom in the process. wicket tries to protect his village but get captured in the process and so does cindel. the two escape and wonder into the woods and run into a playful and fun creature called teek who takes them to a hut where an old hermit named noah played wonderfully by wilford brimley. noa at first does not like the kids but ends up taking them in. terak fed up that he can not get the device to give him it's powers sends his witch that can turn into a raven to get cindel after she tells him that she can unlock the power. so the witch succeeds and noa, wicket and teek go to rescue her. they find teraks castle free the ewoks and cindel and escape noa sees the device and takes it to a ship that he and his friend was on that crashed there years ago. that's how terak got the whole idea about the power was from noa's friend. then they fight thier way back and win. with the help of the ewoks cindel and noa then leave endor saying goodbye to their friends. these two movies are great. and a good edition to you're star wars collection. the acting was great and the story was good. the special effects were not bad at all for it's time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. until next time have a cinematastic day",1505952000,,2563,4.179797979797979

It's not good and doesn't have too many good moment.  Children age 5-7 might like it and it is even more kid-safe than The Return of the Jedi.",1474848000,,299,3.933333333333333
