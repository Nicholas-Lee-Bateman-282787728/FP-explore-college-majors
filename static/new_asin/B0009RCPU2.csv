8065533,4,B0009RCPU2,"My daughter likes the show on Sprout, this DVD is just like it.  I'm glad I got this DVD with several episodes on it. The Berenstain Bears always have a nice lesson in their show. I almost purchased the Christmas DVD, but it was only one episode.  This DVD is best value for the money.",1293667200,2,285,4.163636363636364

You can't find better entertainment for your children or grandchildren!!!!!!!!  VERY SATISFIED, have many now and WILL buy new ones as they come out.  Lee Schrader",1126483200,8,271,5.725
8065538,5,B0009RCPU2,"Our almost 2 year old granddaughter is just getting interested in other shows,besides Dora(although Dora remains the favorite at this time)This Berenstain Bears DVD has 6 episodes,each about 10 minutes long. She has 2 Berenstain Bears books,that we have read to her numerous times so these characters were somewhat familiar for her. She did watch one episode and it did hold her interest the whole time. The Bears do teach perseverance,good manners,etc and no violence so this is a good choice for kids.[...]",1125964800,5,508,5.132530120481928
