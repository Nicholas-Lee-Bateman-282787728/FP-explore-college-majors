And it has a subject matter of interest to me.
I found it interesting how the Lincoln actor told about some of Lincoln's ancestors.  Captain Abraham Lincoln who was killed by Indians. His Uncle Mordecai, who shot the Indian who killed his Grandfather Captain Lincoln. About Obidiah Holmes a religious reformer. He was even related to the Boones.
Also all the poetry Lincoln wrote and memorized and recited. Lincoln was in deed a scholar. The Wild Bear Chase poem was fun.
A.Lincoln's thoughts on life and death is a good video that I re-watched tonight.
I think both young and old will enjoy it like I did.",1365465600,,654,4.589743589743589
