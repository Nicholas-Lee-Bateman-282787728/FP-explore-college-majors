Becauuse at the end of the day you can only do so much with straight shoot em up cowboy flicks. This film tries to expand the genre by turning it into a laugh out loud comedie. The physical humor is very funny and its fun to be surprised by what happenes next.  This is not for everyone, but if you want a break from the same old same old, this film is a good bet.",1148342400,,478,3.78

This old movie classic (`The Local Bad Man') is a laff riot and a must-see flick, especially for those who love Hoot Gibson's endearingly unassuming style.""",1146441600,,315,4.851851851851852
