2414572,4,B000BDH6IK,"This is the fourth set of DVDs that complete the WrestleMania Anthology.  Since the other 3 volumes have extreme highs and lows, it's no surprise that Volume Four suffers the same fate.

WM 2000
---Why in the world isn't there a singles match on this card?  And no, the Cat Fight doesn't count.  Everybody loves the Triangle Ladder Match, which holds up extremely well, despite The Dudleyz wasting 5 minutes to set up tables when they could've won the match.  The 4-Way WWF Title Match and the Two-Falls 3-Way match are the only others that get a lot of praise from fans.  Not a bad ""WM"", but most of these matches were insignifcant back when the PPV first aired.

WM X-Seven
---I'm in the minority, but I don't think this card is as great as most do.  This is mainly because the HHH/Taker match --- in my opinion --- is a glorified slugfest, while Austin/Rock matches rarely did the trick for me.  Having said those sacriligious words, the Angle/Benoit and TLC II bouts are must-see for any wrestling fan of any kind.  With an energetic Houston crowd keeping things going, I like ""WM 17"" for different reasons than most of its supporters.

WM X-8
---While not one of the best ""WrestleMania"" PPVs, this one's undercard is mostly overlooked.  RVD's ""WM"" debut was a strong showing from him, better than his ""WM 22"" Ladder Match.  DDP and Christian had a nice little bump-fest for the European Title.  Kurt Angle brought the best out of then-oafish Kane, even though the finish was sloppy.  The main events don't deliver the goods, in my book.  Austin/Hall featured 6 Stunners...jeez!  I never got into HHH/Jericho, because HHH was given the title push so soon, and Jericho was poorly used as the champion.  However, The Rock and Hogan is a classic in my book!  Pure charisma and decent physicality really propelled it to greatness!

WM XIX
---Easily my favorite ""WM"" of all time.  Each match had its own ""epic feel"", with some sort of signifcance.  I've typed a review on this PPV that gives more detail, but all I can say is that every match on the card was watchable and entertaining.  Well...except for the Hogan/Vince Street Fight...but did anybody really think expect anything more?

WM XX
---""Killer"" is the word I'd use to describe this one.  The two 'KILLER' main events feature astonishing displays of intensity and skill.  Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit embracing is as genuine a moment as and wrestling organization hopes to get on camera.  Christian and Y2J had a solid grudge match with a 'KILLER' shock.
But how else to use 'KILLER' for ""WM 20""?  How about an exciting Cruiserweight Title gauntlet that killed itself with a 3-minute long final fall?  How about Goldberg and Lesnar killing their legacies by getting booed out of the building?  How about two Tag Title matches that were nothing more than poorly-planned Tornado matches, thus killing the Tag divisions to this date?  How about the worst ""WM"" opener in history, with Big Show and John Cena killing NYC enthusiasm, by putting a city that never sleeps into apnea?  Overall, if ""WM 20"" was only 3 hours long, it'd still be a two-trick pony.

OVERALL
---I suggest dishing out the money for the uncensored deluxe DVDs.  This is the strongest of the 4 WrestleMania Anthology Volumes, but I don't think anyone's going to like all five of these PPVs.  If you don't have any of these DVDs, then this is a good buy.  But if you're not sure, then spend the same amount of money of the PPVs you want, with all the extra goodies.",1131494400,6,3493,4.67816091954023

For this review, I will only use WWE for when the change actually happened! They were still WWF at the time of three of these WM's so I will refer to the titles as such for those events. I won't go into every match for these events either. Well, here we go:

WRESTLEMANIA 2000 AKA WRESTLEMANIA 16

This is the first and only WM ever where every match was either a tag team bout or a multiple persons match. Not one one on one contest here and that really drug it down here. For this one, I won't go into every match but rather here are the ones that are worth seeing on this one:

The Hardy Boyz Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. Edge & Christian (Triangle Ladder Match for the WWF World Tag Team Titles) - In a predecessor to the TLC match, these three pioneers of that contest really brought their A-game to this one! Look for one of Edge's legendary spears from the ladder and Jeff Hardy's swanton from the top of a ladder! Of course, the Dudleyz brought their legendary ECW style to this match too.

Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Kurt Angle (Two Fall Triple Threat Match for the WWF Intercontinental & European Championships) - When you say the name Chris Benoit now, you don't think of a great wrestler. I won't go into what you think of now but at this time, he was a highly respect grappler with an intensity and dedication that only few could match. Chris Jericho was almost a year into his first tour with WWF/WWE and had already been an I-C champion. Kurt Angle had just started pro wrestling and was only six months into his career and was already holding the I-C and European titles and was the champion going into this match.

The favorite going in had to be Benoit just because of his reputation and the fact that he had came off of a hot streak in WCW prior to him leaving. All three men turned in a great performance with Angle losing both titles WITHOUT ever being defeated! Benoit left with the I-C title while Jericho left with the European strap.

Too Cool & Chyna Vs. The Radicalz - The Radicalz for this match were the late Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn. This turned out to be a very entertaining match as both teams put on a show. Chyna was the star of this bout she was at the height of her ""powers"" so to speak and worked very well against the three veterans. Ends when she uses a unique sleeper slam on Eddie to get the pin. This would eventually lead to the two getting together to form the original ""Latino Heat"" duo. That name would stay with Eddie until the end of his life in 2005.

The main event was HHH Vs. The Rock Vs. The Big Show Vs. Mick Foley with a McMahon family member in each corner. While not a bad match in itself, it wasn't WM worthy! I think the main event should be no worse than a Triple Threat Match and should always be one on one if possible.

WRESTLEMANIA X-7

This one was from Houston, TX and it is one of the best WM's ever! This also came on the heels of both the original ECW and WCW folding so many fans were wondering if WWF (at this time) would actually lax in their performance because their two rivals were gone? The answer would be a resounding NO!

Chris Jericho Vs. William Regal (WWF Intercontinental Title Match) - A good opener but short of what these two men are capable off. Still, the usually pro-American Texas crowd was behind the Canadian born Jericho against Regal in this one. Ends with Jericho's ""Lionsault"" after falling to lock in the Walls Of Jericho submission for the win. Jericho retains.

Tazz & APA Vs. The Right To Censor - The Right To Censor was a group spoofing the PTC who were vigorous opponnents of WWF/WWE programming at the time. They consisted of Stevie Richards, The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan. A short but good six man that was more of a showfest for Bradshaw (who would later become JBL). Ends with an awesome ""clothesline form hell"" on The Goodfather for the win!

Raven Vs. The Big Show Vs. Kane (WWF Hardcore Title Triple Threat Match) -I'll be honest, I expected Raven to get destroyed here but he surprised me! While he did take some nasty spots, he hung in their with the two giants. It does end when Kane knocks both TBS and Raven off of the stage ramp and follows it with an elbow/legdrop on both of his opponents. Kane wins the Hardcore title.

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Test (WWF European Title Match) - This is definitely one of the late Andrew ""Test"" Martin's best bouts as he took on the late Eddie Guerrero for his European belt. Except for a slow spot where Test got hung up on the ropes by his foot, this was actually a good contest. Ends when Eddie, being his ""lying, cheating and stealing"" self, gets helps from Radical mates Saturn and Malenko for the win and the European strap.

Kurt Angle Vs. Chris Benoit - Their first one on one bout and the beginning of one of the best pure wrestling feuds ever! While the two would go on to have better matches against each other, this one doesn't suck at all! I mean, how many guys can get the crowd to cheer actually chain/mat wrestling?!

Anyway, the match soon changes to straight pro wrestling but even then, rather than cheating they would revert back to counterwrestling to gain the advantage. It ends when Angle counters Benoit's crossface into a rollup for the pin (with the help of some trunks of course *wink*).

Ivory Vs. Chyna (WWF Women's Championship) - The definition of SQUASH! As good as Ivory was and maybe still is, did anyone think she was going to beat Chyna at this point?! Think Beth Phoenix or, even better, Awesome Kong in TNA if you want an idea of how dominant Chyna was in this division! Anyway, a short a**-kicking as Chyna takes the title.

Vince McMahon Vs. Shane McMahon (Streetfight Match) - With special referee Mick Foley and with Linda McMahon at ringside along with Stephanie McMahon and Trish Stratus, this one had action and drama done right! Twists include Trish turning on Vince during the match in revenge for her now infamous ""lingere/bark like a dog"" skit on RAW and Linda (who was supposed to be catonic) rising up from her chair and kicking Vince in his ""grapefruits.""

The match itself wasn't bad but Shane was definitely the star here as he did his version of the Van Terminator on Vince for the win!

The Hardyz w/Lita Vs. The Dudleyz w/Spike Vs. Edge & Christian w/Rhyno (TLC II for the WWF World Tag Team Titles) - In this one, it was a rematch of sorts from last years WM. While I actually like the Triangle Match better, this one had more high spots and was definitely a highlight of WM. The seconds for each team also got their spots in too. Ends when Christian gets the belts for his team with the help of Rhyno.

The Undertaker Vs. HHH - At this point, UT is in his ""American Bada**"" mode though make no mistake, there are still elements of his ""Deadman"" persona if you look close.

As for the match itself, it turned out better than I thought it would going in. I think they began using it back at WM 13 and has used it as an angle for UT since. The match really picks up when it breaks down into a brawl with the referee out for most of it! We even see a near fall as ""The Game"" came so close to ending ""The Streak."" Ends when 'Taker countered into his ""Last Ride"" powerbomb for the win.

Personally, I find it ironic that UT has defeated all the memebers of Evolution AND (with his WM 25 win over Shawn Michaels) has defeated the two charter members of DX as well!

Back to the match, definitely a MUST VIEW!

Gimmick Battle Royal - This actually happened before Taker/HHH as guys from WWF/WWE's past such as Doink, Tugboat, the late Earthquake and Sgt. Slaughter came out for this one. They even let Michael Hayes participate in this as his ""Freebird"" persona rather than his Doc Hendricks persona. Good call on that one, especially since they were in TX!

Ends when The Iron Sheik wins but ends up on the wrong end of a Sgt. Slaughter ""Cobra Clutch.""

The Rock Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (No DQ for the WWF World Title) - This is what a main event should be like! Of the three Austin/Rock WM battles, this one was definitely the best! Even the swerve job at the end can't take away what a classic this was. MUST VIEW!

Overall, this WM was one of the strongest from beginning to end. Certainly the best one on this volume.

WRESTLEMANIA X-8

This one was from the Skydome in Toronto Canada and was the first since 1990's WrestleMania 6. While not as good as X-7, it too was a strong WM with an historic feature match in The Rock Vs. Hulk Hogan.

Rob Van Damn Vs. William Regal (WWF Intercontinental Championship Match) - In his first WM appearance ever, RVD took on the brutal technician in Regal for his I-C title. ""Mr. Monday Night"" was definitely working on all cylinders this night as he took his first I-C title from Regal in arguably his hottest year other than 2006 when he won the WWE Title from John Cena. Worth a look.

Christian Vs. DDP (WWF European Title Match) - While not a classic, it was certainly better than I thought it would be. It would be DDP's last PPV appearance for WWF/WWE as he was forced to retire for short time due to neck problems.

Back to the match, it was (as I said) surprisingly better than I thought it would be. Ends when DDP slips in his diamond cutter for the win.

Goldust Vs. Maven (WWF Hardcore Championship Match) - This one pretty much breaks down and has other people like Al Snow, The Hurricane, Molly Holly and Spike Dudley showing up as well. The ""match"" pretty much runs throughout the rest of the PPV as cats were getting pins and becoming Hardcore champion! Ends when Christian, who got his title beating Molly Holly, tries to sneak out of the building but Maven surprises him with a rollup and gets his title back! He quickly leaves the arena in the limo that was waiting for Christian! LOL!

Kane Vs. Kurt Angle - At this point, Angle is a performer that is regarded as one of the best. This match with Kane proves that point as they actually have a pretty good bout. There is a botched pin spot at the end but even that can't take away from the fact that they had a pretty good bout.

The Undertaker Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair (No DQ match) - In a match that's often forgotten until WM time, The Undertaker had one of his best ""streak"" bouts against the legendary Ric Flair! If not for Hogan/Rock, this would've been the match of the night by far! Also has an appearance from former Horsemen Arn Anderson but that would not be enough as 'Taker would add to ""The Streak.""

Edge Vs. Booker T. - While the angle was ridiculous (fighting over a shampoo endorsment), the match itself was pretty good. Seems Edge has a talent of making a good match out of a stupid storyline (see WM 25).

This has Booker T. really trying to show that he belongs on a major stage in WWF. He, in my eyes, proved that during his stay there but this night would belong to Edge as he picked up the win in front of the hometown crowd.

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. Scott Hall - In this one, the backstage story was actually more interesting than the match itself as it is rumored that Austin was originally slated to job to Hall but refused to do so. After a bit of drama, the nWo finally agreed to job to Austin.

As for the match itself, it wasn't bad but it won't go down as either man's best. It was entertaining nonetheless.

The Hardy Boyz Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. APA Vs. Billy & Chuck (WWF World Tag Team Title Four Corners Match) - This was more of a filler match than anything important. Still, its not bad for what it is. Billy & Chuck retain their gold.

The Rock Vs. Hulk Hogan - THE REAL MAIN EVENT of this WM! With due respect to HHH and Chris Jericho, this is the match most of that crowd came to see! While not the best match from a pure performance standpoint, it certainly got the loudest reaction! Ends when The Rock puts Hogan away with his ""People's Elbow"" after three Rock Bottoms on Hogan. There is even a surprise after that as Rock survived a ""Hulk up"" and a legdrop prior to winning the match. Afterwards, we see a classic WM moment as Hogan and The Rock shook hands and even battled nWo members Hall & Nash afterwards.

Lita Vs. Trish Stratus Vs. Jazz (WWF Women's Championship Match) - I kind of felt sorry for these ladies to follow Hogan/Rock because they did put on a good performance and this is when the ladies division was at its strongest in my view! Plus, this was a homecoming for Trish as she returned to Canada on PPV as an actual performer.

Anyway, ends when Jazz gets a fisherman's buster suplex from the top rope on Lita! Jazz retains her gold.

HHH Vs. Chris Jericho (WWF World Title Match) - Two things really hurt this bout. 1. It followed Rock/Hogan and the crowd was pretty much dead and 2. despite the fact that fellow countryman Jericho was the champion, the match centered around HHH/Stephanie McMahon and made Jericho look kind of weak!

As for the match itself, it wasn't bad but these two have had better bouts. The three count was more like a relief rather than euphoria here! Anyway, HHH wins and becomes WWE Champion!

WRESTLEMANIA 19

In this one, we see the unofficial end of a career, the return of another career and the short-lived brilliance of another career that almost ended tragically. I'll tell you along the way:

Rey Mysterio Vs. Matt Hardy w/Shannon Moore (WWE Cruiserweight Title Match) - This was the first WM under the WWE banner and this opening bout was a bit too short but was also good for the time it was given! Ends when Matt uses the tights and ropes to get the pin on Mysterio to retain his Cruiserweight gold.

The Undertaker Vs. The Big Show & A-Train - In a handicap match, The Undertaker took on two of the biggest men in the business at that time. With a little help from now action actor Nathan Jones, UT kept his ""streak"" alive in this one. A rockin' performance from Limp Bizkit prior to the match puts it in high gear.

Trish Stratus Vs. Victoria Vs. Jazz (WWE Women's Title Triple Threat Match) - In my opinion, this was Trish's best WM appearance as a wrestler and not just because she won but by this point, she was really a pretty good wrestler. Kudos to Jazz and Victoria as well as they put on a good show too. Trish wins when she hits her ""chick kick"" on Victoria for the pin.

Los Guerreros (Eddie & Chavo) Vs. Chris Benoit & Rhyno Vs. Team Angle (Shelton Benjammin & Charlie Haas)(WWE Tag Team Title Triple Threat Match) - In this one, nearly everyone got to show their wears but this is one that could've gone a bit longer. Ends when Rhyno gets in a gore on Chavo BUT Team Angle quickly gets him out of the ring and gets the pin to retain their belts.

Shawn Michaels Vs. Chris Jericho - A MUST VIEW in my book as this one was a classic. It was Michaels' first WM match since 1998 and he couldn't have had a better opponent for it. Jericho, when given the right opponent, can have a 5 star match and that's what this one was. Ends with Michaels getting a surprise rollup for the win but Jericho gets the last laugh by kneeing Michaels in the ""manhood"" after the match.

HHH Vs. Booker T. (World Heavyweight Title Match) - I'll be fair here, this was a good contest if you can ignore the terrible storyline which (thank goodness) was dropped before WM and if you could ignore the backstage politics (which I understand was just as much Booker's fault as it was HHH if not more), you could actually enjoy this bout. It does end with a HHH victory over Booker BUT he does give a great accounting of himself.

Hulk Hogan Vs. Vince McMahon (Street Fight) - This turned out better than I would've gave it credit for. If you've ever seen ""The Mania Of WrestleMania"" special, then you know that there was some real concern that these two would actually go at it for real since there was some real animosity between them. Thankfully, professional heads prevailed but that didn't stop them from using that to create a good matchup! Add the stipulation that if Hogan lost, his career was over made the drama even moreso! It ends, of course, with a Hogan win.

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Rock - For their final encounter, the two actually used more wrestling than in their previous WM matches. Still, it eventually broke down into a brawl the two using each others' moves on the other man! It ends with The Rock finally getting that one on one victory over Austin. I know they hyped it for WM but I believe that's the first time The Rock had ever beaten Austin in a one on one match at any PPV! The story behind this bout is even more compelling as it was also covered in ""The Mania Behind WrestleMania."" Austin almost didn't even make this match as he was in the hospital the night before. Add the drama of his personal life with Debra (think Chris Brown/Rihanna) and its a wonder he had his head on straight to do the bout! Anyway, this was Austin finally official bout as an active competitor.

Anyway, the match itself was good but definitely the weakest of their three matches. Still, it was WM worthy.

Kurt Angle Vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE Title Match) - Much like HHH/Orton at the 25th WM, the stipulation was added that if Kurt tried to get himself DQ'ed or counted out, he would lose the title to Lesnar. Unlike HHH/Orton, it didn't hurt the matchup at all as two of the purest wrestlers ever in WWE history put on a clinic! It almost ended in tragedy as Brock did a shooting star press that not only missed Angle but saw him fall on his head face first! Amazingly, Brock finished the match and won the WWE title. Both men, however, had to be hospitalized afterwards.

Overall, a pretty good WM!

WRESTLEMANIA XX

This one, for an anniversary WM, was kind of weak! BUT, it did have some must views:

John Cena Vs. The Big Show (WWE U.S. Title Match) - That's right! This one's a must view simply because you get to see John Cena back when he was truly ""The Doctor Of Thuganomics."" He was more like a ""Stone Cold"" character than the superhero he portrays now. Ends when he gets his FU on TBS not once but twice!

Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - An often forgotten match that was a very good bout and really a jumping off point for Christian'solo career. Add the unexpected heel turn of Trish Stratus to help give Christian the win and you have a great WM moment.

The Rock & Mick Foley Vs. Evolution - In this 2 on 3 handicap match, this was more of a showcase for Evolution's Batista and Randy Orton. Ric Flair, The Rock and Foley do have their moments in this one though! Ends when Randy gets in a surprise RKO on Foley for a clean win!

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title Match) - In his first PPV title defense, Guerrero went against former champion Angle. While these two would have better encounters after this one, this was a good stamp on Eddie's career to show that his reign was for real and not just a transition champion. Ends when Eddie pulls a dirty trick by untieing his boot and using it to escape Angle's anklelock submission for a roll up for the pin!

The Undertaker Vs. Kane - The match itself wasn't that good. It wasn't anywhere near their classic at WM 14 but the entrances of both is what makes this bout worth looking at. Anyway, the ""streak"" continues.

Chris Benoit Vs. HHH Vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Triple Threat Match) - A classic WM match in every sense of the word. While this probably won't be brought up again due to Benoit's actions, anyone that has ever seen this bout will agree it was the defining moment of Chris' career before his murder/suicide in June 2007. The ending with long time friend Eddie Guerrero coming out and sharing the spotlight with him also makes this one both touching and now very haunting.

Despite my own bad feelings towards Benoit for what he did, I will not take away that moment because it was his crowning moment at that time. The ending of the match still makes my heart warm and I only wish that his end (Chris') could've been better. But it is what it is. Still, it was his moment in 2004 and no amount of erasing will change that.

Overall, this volume has two strong WM's (X-7 & X-8) and several moments that makes it worth purchasing.",1235347200,,20281,4.377227986166534
2414603,4,B000BDH6IK,"I'll be honest, I did not purchase this set because I have all of these Wrestlemania events taped on VHS. So I don't know what have been edited, what has been blurred out, or what music has been altered.

Wrestlemania 2000 - This year's Wrestlemania was more about ""Quanity"" rather than ""Quality"". Having too many matches that didn't belong to be at a Wrestlemania. The event for the second time hosted from the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, CA. We see the return of the ladder match at this Wrestlemania with it being a triangular ladder match for the Tag Team Title between The Hardys, Edge & Christian, and The Dudleys. Also a 2 Fall Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental and European Titles as Kurt Angle defends them against Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. And for the first time in Wrestlemania history a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match main evented Wrestlemania as Triple H defended the WWF Title against The Rock, Mick Foley, & The Big Show with every McMahon in somebody's corner.

Wrestlemania X-Seven - Most proclaim this Wrestlemania as the best ever. Not really a bad match on here. Just a squash Women's Title Match and an Intercontinental Ttitle Match between William Regal & Chris Jericho that didn't live up to the hype. The rest of the card is pretty much dead on as we see The Rock defending his WWF Title against Stone Cold Steve Austin in Austin's home state of Texas. The TLC Match debuting at a Wrestlemania that would eventually lead to the birth of the Money in the Bank Ladder Match later at a Wrestlemania. Other standout matches includes Triple H vs. The Undertaker, Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle, and The McMahon Family Street Fight between Shane McMahon and Mr. McMahon.

Wrestlemania X8 - Wrestlemania returns to Toronto as it was a step below from the previous Wrestlemania. We witness at this Wrestlemania the classic confrontation between The Rock and Hulk Hogan that nearly made every other match on the card invisible (including the Triple H and Chris Jericho Undisputed Title main event). Another good match to point out is the No Disqualification Match between Ric Flair and The Undertaker as we see a Horsemen reunion as Arn Anderson comes down the ring and delivers a spinebuster to the Deadman. Another standout match is Kurt Angle vs. Kane.

Wrestlemania XIX - Another good Wrestlemania card that is pretty much good from start to finish. Hosting from Safeco Field in Seattle we see the return of ""Mr. Wrestlemania"" at a Wrestlemania as Shawn Michaels faces Chris Jericho. Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle for the WWE Title in the main event. Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock for the final time. Hulk Hogan battling Mr. McMahon in a Street Fight. Other standout match is Booker T vs. Triple H for the World Heavyweight Title. Last Wrestlemania matches for Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.

Wrestlemania XX - Wrestlemania returns to Madison Square Garden for its 20th Anniversary. Not the greatest Wrestlemania but we do see some good moments from this Wrestlemania. As Chris Benoit finally winning the World Heavyweight Title agianst Triple H & Shawn Michaels in a Triple Threat Match. The return of The Undertaker in his ""Deadman"" gimmick with Paul Bearer as he battles Kane. The reunion of The Rock -n- Sock Connection as they face Evolution where we see The Rock and Ric Flair facing off agianst each other for the first time. But most matches here were just fillers. Such as the two four team Tag Team Title matches, the Cruiserweight Title Open, and the Evening Gown Playboy Match. And to include a squash match between Brock Lesnar and Goldberg with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special referee. Other standout matches includes John Cena vs. The Big Show for the U.S. Title and Chris Jericho vs. Christian. Wrestlemania debuts for Randy Orton, John Cena, & Batista.

2414647,5,B000BDH6IK,"I waited a long time for the WWE to release WrestleMania I-XIV on DVD.  I must say that overall I was not disappointed.  Each WrestleMania is shown in its entirety (with the exception of WrestleMania XI).  The WrestleMania DVDs show the original television broadcasts.  I owned just about every WrestleMania in their original VHS format.  The older tapes of the shows they released were heavily edited in order to fit the program on one cassette.  They even edited some matches to make them shorter.  The only way you could see all these matches in their entirety was to watch the original television broadcasts ... until now!

Now, here is what is what is wrong with the DVD sets:

-Entrance music for a lot of Superstars is dubbed over with crappy, generic music so the WWE would not have to pay royalties to use these songs.

-Any verbal reference to WWF is edited out

-WrestleMania XIV-X8 blurs out the WWF scratched logo

-The Salt N' Pepper performance at WrestleMania XI was completely taken out so the WWE would not have to pay them royalties

-There are no extra features whatsoever ... just the event itself for every WrestleMania

I hated that all this great entrance music was taken out.  The edited out the entrance music to Slick's ""Jive Soul Bro,"" HillBilly Jim's ""Country Boy,"" Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Demolition, Big Boss Man's ""Hard Time,"" and Ric Flair's original entrance music to name just a few.  I really miss ""Jive Soul Bro!""  I would have shelled out more dough for these DVDs if they ensured all the old theme music was included.  The blurred out WWF scratched logo is annoying but bearable.

Personally, I only purchased the first three box sets of WrestleMania I-XV because I already owned WresteMania XV-21 on DVD.  If you would prefer to own copies without all the WWF references edited out, I recommend you do the same and try to buy the original WresteleMania DVD releases off of Amazon or eBay for XV-21.  Plus, you miss out on a ton of DVD extras that the original DVD releases are packed with.

Regardless of the gigs I give this box set, I highly recommend to add these DVDs to your collection if you are a professional wrestling fan.  Every single match and interview is shown in its entirety.  Plus, it is the only way you will get these classic WrestleMania's in DVD format.",1142726400,14,2320,4.671604938271605
2414648,4,B000BDH6IK,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2014

A couple of notes here in that changes have been made since the original airing of these events in that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring & all logos used during the ""Attitude Era"" have been blurred out.  It should also be noted that these double sided disc contain the PPV only, no extras or pre-show matches.

WrestleMania 2000 (the 16th edition) returned to the west coast for the third time in history with Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond hosting the event for the second time.  Celebrities include rapper Ice-T & Pete Rose making his third straight Mania appearance with a special baseball bat while other celebrities were at ringside throughout the show including Michael Clark Duncan.  This WrestleMania also set the record for the most debuts at one event featuring Lilian Garcia, Tazz, Crash Holly, Trish Status, Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, Mae Young, Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, and Stephanie McMahon.  The main event for this WrestleMania was historic in that it was the first ever Fatal Four Way elimination match for the WWE Championship with the added bonus of a member of the McMahon family in each participant's corner as Triple H with Stephanie defended the title against Big Show with Shane, Mick Foley with Linda, and The Rock with Vince in a match that went close to 40 minutes that saw not only fighting with the participants but the family members on the outside with Mr. McMahon delivering on his promise that he ""would make everything right"" within his family.  Another first happened here in the first ever 3 way for the WWE Tag Team Championship with the Dudleys vs. Hardys vs. Edge & Christian in what was advertised as a Ladder Match but turned into a Tables & Ladder Match that saw so many men take unbelievable falls & risk including one body going through a table with such impact that it look like it exploded on impact along with Jeff Hardy doing a swanton off the ladder that you had to see to believe at that time.  Other matches include Kurt Angle becoming the first man to defend two championships in one match as he faced off against Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho in a two fall Triple Threat Match with the Intercontinental & European Championships defended separately in each fall, Rikishi & Kane vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac, Too Cool & Chyna vs. The Radicalz, T&A vs. Al Snow & Steve Blackman, The Kat with Mae Young vs. Terri Runnels with Fabulous Moolah in a Catfight with Val Venis as the referee with each woman trying to get on Val's good side in one way or another, Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan vs. Godfather & D'Lo Brown, and a Hardcore Battle Royal for the WWE Hardcore Championship where unlimited pins were allowed during the time limit with the man who was the champion at the end of the time period would be the official champion.

WrestleMania X-7 came from the Astrodome in Houston, Texas and was a memorable event in part because this was the first time that WWE was without competition on a national level as they had purchased World Championship Wrestling a week earlier while Extreme Championship Wrestling had filed for bankruptcy a month earlier.  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars like Paul Heyman, Johnathan Coachman, William Regal, Steven Richards, Raven, Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Lita, Michael Hayes, Kamala, and The Gobbledy Gooker (yes, I had to throw that one in!).  The Rock & Steve Austin faced off in the main event for the WWE Championship for the second time in WrestleMania history with a No Disqualification stipulation in a match where they give it everything to the point where both men were bleeding from their heads using anything & everything they could get their hands on to physically beat on each other with the lasting moment being not only who showed up but who he helped that nobody would ever expect with both commentators saying the infamous words ""(He) sold his soul for the WWE Championship...(he's) shaking hands with Satan himself!""  After they tore the house down in their Ladder Match a year earlier only to up the ante months later in the first ever T.L.C. match, the WWE Tag Team Championship was defended once again in a the match called ""T.L.C. II"" with Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz that once again saw them not only put their careers on the line but each team having an associate that came down to help them during the match also becoming victims of the violence as well as this match also contained the highlight reel of the highest spear in history.  Mr. McMahon competed for the first time at the event he created accompanied by not only his daughter Stephanie but also his comatose wife Linda & mistress Trish Stratus in a Street Fight against his son Shane who also bought WCW from underneath him earlier in the week that saw it all from weapons used to tables destroyed to Vince & Shane not being the only ones who got into a fight during the match as karma ultimately came back to haunt Mr. McMahon with Mick Foley being the referee throughout all this chaos.  Other matches include Undertaker returning to his home state of Texas under his ""American Bad Ass"" persona to defend his streak against Triple H who had the legendary band Motorhead perform his theme song ""The Game"" in a match that not only happened in the ring but through the crowd all the way to a part of the sound stage in the middle of the arena, Raven defending the WWE Hardcore Championship against both Kane & Big Show in a match that saw them destroy the backstage area either though breaking through walls or thrown through windows or ran down by golf carts, Bobby Heenan & Gene Okerland returning to WWE after over 7 years to do the commentary on the Gimmick Battle Royal that saw many names & gimmicks from the past return, Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit in a pure wrestling match, Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. William Regal, European Champion Test vs. Eddie Guerrero, Tazz & A.P.A. vs. Right To Censor, and Womens Champion Ivory vs. Chyna.

WrestleMania X-8 was the second international WrestleMania as the Skydome in Toronto, ONT, Canada once again hosted the event 12 years after WrestleMania VI.  Celebrities involved with the show included rock groups Saliva & Drowning Pool who performed various songs throughout the night including entrance music from the WWE's ""Forceable Entry"" album with various superstars making their WrestleMania debuts including referees Nick Patrick & Charles Robinson, Rob Van Dam, Stacy Keibler, Shane ""Hurricane"" Helms, and Jazz.  The subtitle of this Wrestlemania was ""Icon vs. Icon"" because of the dream match that happened in Hulk Hogan returning to WWE for the first time in almost a decade under his nWo persona of ""Hollywood"" facing off against The Rock in a match that stole the show that nobody could follow (which I'll talk more about later) with the crowd reacting to each & every single thing they did to the point where Jim Ross put it perfectly when they were just staring each other down & not even touch each other yet, ""This is a WrestleMania moment"" but also remembered for how the fans reacted to each participant which would definitely begin to change the direction of both superstars careers differently after the match.  Chris Jericho returned to his home country as the Undisputed Champion defending the championship against Triple H with the added bonus of having Triple H's ex-wife Stephanie McMahon in his corner in a good quality match that ultimately went down as a disappointment due to the fact that they had to follow the Hogan/Rock match which completely exhausted the crowd to the point where nobody could match or follow it along with the story of Jericho defending the championship & injuring Triple H's quad months earlier taking a backseat to the Triple H/Stephanie saga (Jericho at one point was walking Stephanie's dog & picking up the dog's poop as the Undisputed Champion!?!) that was all about him eventually getting his hands on Stephanie.  Other matches include Undertaker attempting to take his streak to 10-0 in a No Disqualification Match against another legend making his return to WrestleMania in Ric Flair in a battle that saw Flair busted open along with him getting some help from his ""Enforcer"", Steve Austin facing nWo member Scott Hall with Kevin Nash in his corner in a match that's remembered more for the behind the scenes controversy as far as how frustrated Austin was & how this added to the problems that would lead to his eventual walkout months later, Edge going from a fan in the crowd 12 years earlier to wrestling at the show against Booker T, ""Diamond"" Dallas Page drove Rhythm & Blues' pink Cadillac to the ring at WrestleMania VI & returned to the same venue at this Mania to defend his European Championship against Christian, Intercontinental Champion William Regal vs. Rob Van Dam, WWE Tag Team Champions Billy & Chuck vs. A.P.A. vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz in an Elimination Match, Womens Champion Jazz vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus, Kurt Angle vs. Kane, and Hardcore Champion Maven vs. Goldust in a match that started a series of backstage chaos throughout the night over that championship.

WrestleMania XIX took place at Safeco Field in Seattle, WA in what was the first Mania to take place under WWE's brand extension of the rosters being split between RAW & SmackDown leading to the debut of several new championships throughout the show along with several superstars such as Rey Mysterio, Victoria, Shelton Benjamin, Charlie Hass, Chavo Guerrero, Torrie Wilson, and Brock Lesnar.  Celebritity appearances include Limp Bizkit performing throughout the night along with the Miller Lite Catfight Girls making an appearance for an pillowfight with Stacy Keibler & Torrie Wilson.  Brock Lesnar made history as the first man in his rookie year to main event WrestleMania as he challenged for the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle in a pure wrestling match based around both men's background as celebrated amature wrestlers that's remembered for Angle competing with an injured neck that would require surgery along with Brock attempting a high risk move that saw him crash & burn to the point where he could have broken his neck.  A Street Fight 20 years in the making happened between Mr. McMahon & Hulk Hogan in what turned out to be a bloody brawl between both men that saw then use whatever they could from ladders to steel pipes with the infamous image of McMahon creeping up from the apron covered in blood looking like Satan himself with a special appearance from a man who's had his history with both men.  Other matches include The Rock & Steve Austin facing off for the third & final time at WrestleMania in what turned out to be Austin's final match, Chris Jericho going one on one with the man he grew up idolizing as a wrestler in Shawn Michaels, World Champion Triple H vs. Booker T, Undertaker defending his streak in a handicap match against Big Show & A-Train, WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros vs. Chris Benoit & Rhyno, Womens Champion Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, and Crusierweight Champion Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio.

""Where It All Begins Again!"" was the tagline for WrestleMania XX back at Madison Square Garden for their 20th edition featuring the WrestleMania debuts of such superstars as John Cena & Goldberg.  Chris Benoit walked into the main event looking for his first true World Heavyweight Championship in over decade long career as the Royal Rumble winner & challenger against not only the champion Triple H but also another challenger in Shawn Michaels in one of the greatest triple threats in the history of the company that saw one man bloody & the first ever time this type of finish occurred in a WrestleMania main event.  Two of the most dominate superstars in recent years met in what was set to be a dream match between Brock Lesnar & Goldberg with Steve Austin as the special guest referee in a match that's remembered most for how the crowd reacted to both men knowing that they were leaving WWE after the match with each man working very stiff & not doing much with neither man standing once everything was over.  Other matches include Undertaker returning to WWE under his original ""Deadman"" persona complete with his druids & Paul Bearer in his corner to face the man who buried him alive months earlier at Survivor Series in his brother Kane, WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle, United States Champion Big Show vs. John Cena, Chris Jericho vs. Christian in a battle over Trish Stratus, Womens Champion Victoria vs. Molly Holly in a ""Title vs. Hair"" match, Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Ms. Jackie a Playboy Evening Gown Match, World Tag Team Champions Booker T & Rob Van Dam vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrax & Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance, WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. A.P.A. vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Basham Brothers, and a WWE Crusierweight Championship Open gauntlet match.

WrestleMania 2000 did have some standout matches but also had around half of the card full of matches come off as filler or just thrown together just to get as many people on the card as possible.  WrestleMania X-7 has been received as possibly the greatest PPV in the history of company from not just from an in-ring standout but a production one as well as it was an event many have also called the apex of the ""Attitude Era"".  WrestleMania X8 was a small step down from the previous year as far as the buildup & the placement of some matches but still delivered on in-ring action.  WrestleMania XIX was the last classic Mania as far as high quality in-ring work from start to finish as it was the hardest I've seen everyone work on one event with so many classic matches & moments.  WrestleMania XX was a stacked event that had some legendary returns, memorable moments, and some great action on top of it but also did have it's share of matches that were ""quantity over quality"" just there to get as many people on the card as possible.  Overall these are still events that have replay value to me so I would get this volume.",1136851200,32,14214,4.762291751320602
