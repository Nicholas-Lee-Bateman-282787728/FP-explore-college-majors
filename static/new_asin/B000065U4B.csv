1708713,3,B000065U4B,"This movie was a ok movie with excellent prefomance by Jesse and jordan,
  Jonathans preformance lacked interest, his character didn't need  to be in the movie, this is the first movie where i didn't like his preformance
the only thing remotely gay in this film is  the language  nothing else so it lacked there
the romance or lack thereof with jesse and jordan  kept you wanting more  this is a must see movie  however don't watch if the only reason is Jonathan  he is ""hot"" but not in this movie
if you want jonathan playing a gay character  try ""Common Ground"" he  did a absolute EXCELLENT preformance with that movie",1025827200,,620,4.545454545454546
1708714,4,B000065U4B,"I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't earth-shattering or terribly exciting, but it was a heartfelt portrayal of friendship and the unlikely ways that complete strangers can come into your life, forever change it, and leave again.
Jesse Bradford holds the main role well, but his character here has kind of the constantly-dumbstruck look and mannerisms of his Bring it On character.  Still, his acting is good and shows good potential.
The real star and best actor in this film is Jordon Brower.  I had never seen him before, and was impressed with his acting ability.  Same goes for Darryl Hannah - she's always been one of my favorite actresses, and her performance here is just the right balance of strength and fear.
All in all, a good buddy movie with a somewhat predictable (read: tug on the heartstrings) ending, but worth the investment.",1024876800,,840,4.853146853146853
1708715,2,B000065U4B,"Speedway Junky is an indie film and as such I think we need to provide some latitude with regard to a rating scale. That said, the script of an independent film does not need to be given any latitude. Such is the case with this film. The young actors who carry this film are doing their level best to make this an engaging film - and to their credit, that much happens. In fact, the acting here is far better than many much higher profile films.
Jesse Bradford (of Hackers and Clockstoppers) is a teenager who's run away from home to become a race car driver in Charlotte, NC (thus the title of the film). He makes it to Las Vegas where (fairly believably) he expects to strike it rich and finance the rest of his trip to NC. Of course, he is ripped off and forced to stay in Vegas and basically live on the street. Then he meets Eric (Jordan Brower), whom he doesn't realize is an underage male prostitute. He and Eric become friends and he begins living in Eric's (is it an abandoned building or is it just a really seedy weekly hotel?) place.
Apparently here is where the story begins to get hackneyed and disjointed. Of course, you can ultimately follow the story, but it just doesn't have the flow necessary to keep the tensions high when they need to be, nor the emotions steady when they need to be.
Eric, of course, is a cute as a bug, clean cut, non-drug using, prostitute with a heart of gold (aren't they all?). He falls for Bradford, but Bradford isn't gay (he later divulges that he is in fact a virgin - period. Eric hangs out with a group of other teen boys and girls (are they all prostitutes and thieves or just some of them?). To the credit of the screenwriter, the ""leading"" kids are unique and identifiable.
Jonathon Taylor Thomas (of Home Improvement fame) shows up as a slick smoothe ""buy""sexual (""if you buy him something nice, he'll have sex with you"") streetwalker. Just what this capable actor is doing in this film is unknown. He is good in the part, what there is of it, but either he or the screenwriter, or the editor decided to make his character vague and lackluster. Thomas is the villain of the piece and as such we should know more about him, but we don't.
Darryl Hanna shows up as a former female prostitute with a heart of gold, dating a cop, and who just happens to be the best friend of Eric's mother who abandoned him (got all that?). I've always thought that Hanna was an ""actor-lite,"" and I've never been sure how she managed to get as many parts as she has. Here, in a fairly creepy scene (Hanna's pushing 40 isn't she?) she ""deflowers"" our little star, Bradford, as a favor for her little buddy Eric, who goes nuts over the thought that Bradford is having sex with someone other than him. To his credit, Brower, makes his young character believable and charismatic.
I won't go farther in detailing the plot, because it does have a touching and interesting ""twist"" in it, but it is one that you've seen before in dozens of films of similar genre (Sharkey's Machine, My Own Private Idaho, and any other film where there is a good-hearted hooker in love with a respectable person).
It's not that this is a BAD film, because it's not. In fact, I think with a better edit job, the film could be much better. With a beefier script and editor, it could be supremely better.
Make no mistakes: this is a drama and a slow one. However, the performances make it worth watching, even if the script is lacking.
I do recommend this film, because it is far better than many other ""gay"" genre or prostitute genre films such as ""No One Sleeps"" (or any other film Wolf Video). In fact, Gus Van Sant, as executive producer, seems to have had a hand in aspects of the film.
Check it out, but don't expect it to be a fully satisfying venture.",1024876800,5,3765,4.395415472779369
1708716,4,B000065U4B,"The performances in ""Speedway Junkie"" ranged from good to excel-
lent. Nothing to complain about there.
The story was surprisingly warm for a tale about male prosti-
tutes. The relationship between a gay street hustler and a neophyte whose dream is to race stock cars starts with the usual
shock and disgust and develops into a caring, trusting friendship. Problems with housing, food, and crime threaten from
every turn.

1708717,3,B000065U4B,"""Speedway Junky"" shows the growing relationship of two teenaged hustlers in Las Vegas.  Eric (played by Jordan Brower) is experienced and gay; Johnny (Jesse Bradford) is a novice and straight.
Johnny has run away from home to gamble his savings in Las Vegas in the hopes of becoming a stock car racer in North Carolina.  In separate moments of distraction and panic, he loses his money and his duffel bag, leaving him destitute.  Eric, attracted to Johnny, takes him in.  Eric introduces Johnny to a group of young delinquents, whose dominant personality is Steve (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).  Eric and Steve are eager to help Johnny get oriented and successful.  Johnny rapidly gets used to shoplifting, joyriding, and safekeeping others' drug stuff, but the sexual and romantic sides of Johnny are more complicated.
Johnny is straight and would like nothing better than to have his first success at giving a woman an orgasm.  He gets opportunities, some comic and some injurious, with a newly-wed, a high-class hustler, two beauties [photographed for Playboy!], and with a more mature friend of Eric's mother (Veronica, played by Daryl Hannah).  Not many normal men, much less a down-and-out teen, would get such a string of scoring opportunities.  Still, it's just the thrill of the sex itself to him.
Meanwhile, Eric has fallen in love with Johnny and does what he can to build the relationship.  Eric has Veronica as an understanding confidante.  Although Johnny starts out bawling out his shock at meeting a chickenhawk, Johnny slowly gets more assured and trusting with the gay Eric and eventually offers to take Eric away with him on an undefined basis to North Carolina.
The action accelerates when Steve has an immediate need for cash and finds a willingness to do what it takes to get himself out of the bind, regardless of the consequences to Eric or Johnny.
The movie is nicely acted  (I especially liked Jordan Brower's performance as Eric.) and photographed.
The movie-makers do not present a single view of how to take the film.
Certainly, despite the topic, it is not a titillating skin flick.  The only depictions of prostitution are of getting into or out of cars and a comic scene where Johnny is picked up momentarily by a fancy female prostitute.  Johnny goes shirtless some, as does a significant drug dealer once.  One woman takes her blouse off, keeping her large bra on.  Eric jumps from afar into a swimming pool.  The film is about relationships, not titillation, nor is the movie a condemnation of street life.
The relationships are tricky.  Eric loves Johnny.  Johnny thinks Eric is the best friend he ever had.  Still Johnny and Eric both have (different) relationships with Veronica, and Johnny's plans won't include Eric forever.  At the movie's end, it is not clear whether Johnny thinks of Eric or Veronica at all or if they are filed away as a weird, unmentionable interlude in Las Vegas.  The audience will have to decide whether Eric or Johnny is the moral focus of the film and what the film is to mean.",1024012800,,3039,4.871595330739299

Well, there's no sex in the movie and the story isn't very gritty, or interesting for that matter. The commentary by the director is kind of nice.

It was interesting to see some of the stars play a part not in keeping with their original image from previous films, but I thought they handled it very well.

1708721,5,B000065U4B,"Nickolas Perry's ""Speedway Junky"" sounds like a race-car thriller but is actually a tender love story set in the Las Vegas underbelly. Inevitably it recalls ""Midnight Cowboy"" in some aspects but possesses sufficient individuality and personality to avoid being derivative. It marks an unusually mature feature debut for writer-director Perry, who combines visual grace and nuanced portrayals from an array of carefully chosen actors, including Daryl Hannah, in one of her sharper performances.
Jesse Bradford stars as Johnny, an Army brat who has run away from his home on a California military base to head for Charlotte, N.C., determined to become a member of race car driver Richard Petty's crew, the first step toward becoming a racing champion himself.
He stops in Las Vegas with the idea of earning some quick money to finance the rest of his trip, but in no time he's separated from his last $20 and a pack containing all his possessions.
When in desperation he unsuccessfully hits upon a woman in an expensive car for a handout, he is observed by another youth, Eric (Jordan Brower), hanging out in the same nondescript strip mall as Johnny.
There's a big difference in the two young men. For all his gentle demeanor and sensitivity Eric is a seasoned hustler who understands the old Vegas truth that you don't get anything for nothing. Eric offers shelter to Johnny, who he discovers is a young man of stunning naivete. Johnny is willing to hustle, but only women. Eric, who is gay, accepts that Johnny is straight but can't help falling in love with him anyway. As Johnny enters a world of danger and uncertainty, he realizes he can love Eric as the best friend he's ever had, even if he is not sexually attracted to him.
Perry takes us into the world of convenience stores, cheap apartments, deserted parking-structure stairwells and cruising areas that exist in the shadows outside the bright lights of Vegas. Johnny meets Veronica (Hannah), Eric's late mother's friend who's slid from the chorus line to prostitution to the arms of the tough vice cop who arrested her. She and Eric have a mother-son bond, and Hannah is wonderful at conveying Veronica's wisdom, vulnerability and ultimate resilience. Key among Eric's pals is Jonathan Taylor Thomas' Steve, a determined hustler who overestimates his street smarts. Patsy Kensit is a chic prostitute.
With its shifting moods captured beautifully by both Stan Ridgway's poignant score and Steve Adcock's evocative camera work, ""Speedway Junky"" is a potent mixture of sentiment and grit, and it showcases the talents of its young principals.
Gus Van Sant signed on as one of the film's executive producers, and Perry has come up with a movie worthy of the support of the director of ""Mala Noche,"" ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho.""

1708744,1,B000065U4B,"Johnny wants to be a race car driver. So armed with twenty dollars and a duffel bag, he hitches a ride to Las Vegas. His plan? To win money in a slot machine and take the bus to Charlotte NC - the home of race car driving. Of course, within moments he has lost his twenty dollars and soon after that he loses his duffel bag. What's left to do but to fall in with a group of hustlers and try to make some money.

You know this movie, right? About the innocent that has to learn to defend himself/herself in the big bad city.

And so Johnny has a lot of learning to do. Unfortunately, it's hard to stick around to watch him learn because Speedway Junky is bad on so many levels.

1. It's hustler ""lite."" The movie lacks any real tension or grit. You'd expect a movie that explores male hustling to have depth to it. that we would see the harrowing side of this life - drugs, sex, prostitution, etc. None of it is here. Just a few ""F"" bombs and some occasional talk about sex.

2. Johnny makes dumb choices. He seems emotionally and mentally immature and it's difficult to root for him. Basic internet access should've made Johnny more savvy than he is.

3. The acting including Jesse Bradford (Johnny), Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, and particularly the thug Latino who appears intermittently throughout is pretty atrocious. Characters act and react, and you roll your eyes. Darryl Hannah and Jordan Brower (until his ending over-the-top speech) are the only two minor exceptions (emphasis on  minor).

The have been good movies about race-car driving, male hustling, and characters having to grow up quickly. Speedway Junky isn't one of them. This speedway is filled with a pretty bad accident.

1708749,5,B000065U4B,"I very much enjoyed ""Speedway Junkie"" Being a Jessie Bradford fan already it was cool to see him in this gritty realistic drama.
Jordan Brower is in my opinion is the stand out ,he gives a heart breaking convincing performance as ""Eric"" the gay hustler who falls in love with Bradford's character ""Johnny"" and so desperately want's Johnny to return his feelings. Johnny is a small town boy so he is new to all this and overwhelmed by behavior he has not been exposed to, so he has to weed out the good the bad and the ugly so to speak.
Daryl Hannah is also good as the woman who Eric considers his mom. She has been beaten by time, circumstance and a man or two in her day. Quite a few other characters are introduced some relevant some not. All the characters are trying to survive and through the course of the movie you see who's hardened to the point of no return and who still has the ability to use human emotions for the good of others.

1708782,5,B000065U4B,"""Speedway Junky"" is a street-smart love story with a gritty, queer edge.

Executive Producer Gus Van Sant (My Own Private Idaho, Tarnation, Good

Will Hunting, Elephant...) hands out another brilliant one here.

""Speedway Junky"" is about a young tough guy, Johnny (Jesse Bradford), who

runs away toward North Carolina in hopes of becoming a race car driver. He

stops short in Las Vegas when he gets mugged for everything he owns.

Quickly introduced to life on the streets by Eric (Jordan Brower), a gay

hustler, and his crew (including stellar performances by television

hot-shots Tiffany Amber-Thiesen and Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Johnny's life

takes a pretty big turn with absolutely nothing predictable about it.

Problems with drugs, money, sex, queer love, the tough streets, and

following dreams come together to form a brilliant story.

Not only is the story intelligent, urgent, and fresh, but the cast is

phenomenal, (even if you're not a sucker for the 90's television stars),

the cinematography unforgettable, and the production is, once again, a Gus

Van Sant grand slam. This movie is excellent. 5 stars.",1132185600,4,1126,5.212290502793296
1708783,4,B000065U4B,"Some have said this movie isn't ""real"" enough . . . but it needn't be.  What it is, is a film with a lot of heart and if one approaches it as a fable, you'll find it works.  It's a heartbreaker of a movie with strong, committed performances by everyone involved.  Dreams of NASCAR collide with male prostitution, shattered dreams and street life in Vegas for a gripping, sometimes unsettling, beautiful little movie.",1107475200,12,416,4.671232876712328
1708784,3,B000065U4B,"I've never recommended a DVD solely for the director's commentary before, but I'm doing just that with Nickolas Perry's ""Speedway Junky"" (1999).  The film itself is a totally predictable, sanitized view of Las Vegas street hustlers that contains two very good performances (one by someone you'd never expect), one terrible performance by a badly miscast former child star and a dual ending that is both misguided and, in the case of the tacked-on ""happy"" ending, insulting to the audience's intelligence.  In all, ""Speedway Junky"" is a definite mixed bag; however, the DVD version is redeemed by an excellent director's commentary in which writer/director Perry provides an honest critique of his own work and gives an invaluable lesson on the process of making an independent film in today's Hollywood.

Jesse Bradford, who as a child gave one of 1992's best performances in Steven Soderberg's forgotten gem ""King of the Hill,"" stars as Johnny, a teenage drifter who is hitchhiking from Los Angeles to Daytona Beach to join the Nascar circuit as a pit crew worker.  To fund his journey, he takes a detour to Las Vegas, hoping to parlay his meager assets into enough money to complete his trip and then live on until he finds work.  Unfortunately, within minutes of his arrival in town, he loses his money and all his possessions.  His circumstances look bleak until he catches the eye of Eric (Jordan Brower), a gay teenage street hustler who falls in love with him at first sight and takes him in.  Eric also initiates him into his seedy world and extended family, including his adopted ""mother,"" an ex-showgirl and junky wonderfully played by Daryl Hannah, and various friends and ""associates,"" including a shady fellow hustler named Steven (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).  Although Johnny is straight, he and Eric form a strong friendship and bond which gets them both through the bleak days ahead, as Johnny vainly tries to earn money by hustling women and Eric's shady friends threaten their very existence.

The main problem with ""Speedway Junky"" is that it so predictable that the audience will know exactly how it is going end almost from the moment it starts.  It is also extremely derivative of countless earlier, and better, films, including its obvious main source of inspiration--John Schlesinger's 1969 Oscar winner ""Midnight Cowboy.""  As for the performances, they are uneven, to say the least.  Jesse Bradford is an excellent young actor, but he overacts constantly and gives a totally annoying performance as Johnny, which isn't good when you are the film's hero.  And poor Jonathan Taylor Thomas is simply horrible as the devious hustler Steven; in fact, after the shock value of hearing the clean-cut former child star use four letter words and graphically describe anal sex is over, his entire act becomes tiresome until late in the film when he is required to become vicious and then he is laughable.  On the other hand, Hannah is wonderful as a faded beauty who has hit rock-bottom, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and Patsy Kensit have  nice cameos as two of Johnny's potential female ""tricks.""  And then there's Jordan Brower, who is simply wonderful as Eric, giving the kind of eye-opening, and wholly unexpected, performance that in a better, and more widely-seen, film would have brought him a great deal of attention.  He is simply working at a level the rest of the cast, with the exception of Hannah, don't come close to reaching.  In fact, his scenes with Hannah provide all of the film's best, and most realistic moments.  (Take special note of Eric's ""breakdown"" scene which is beautifully rendered.)

As for the film's other problems, they are numerous and start with the weak screenplay, which ends by trashing the most sympathetic character in the film and then tacks on a happy ending that is unbelievable, to say the least.  But don't take my word for it, just listen to writer/director Perry's own commentary, which leads me back to where I began.  The commentary is extremely illuminating in that Perry explains every single detail of the production of the film and why he did the things he did.  Why did he add a silly, and unnecessary chase scene halfway through?  Why was Jonathan Taylor-Thomas cast in a role he was clearly wrong for?  Why does he have a long and boring credit sequence at the beginning when it clearly hurts the flow of the film?  And why the heck did he trash the one gay character in the film and not predict that audiences would hate him for it?  For that matter, why did he include the ridiculous final scene?  He answers all these questions and in the process teaches us all that even in today's independent film world, to get financing for a film you have to make the same kind of compromises that are necessary when working with the studios.  It is an eye-opening lesson, to be sure, and one that all aspiring filmmakers would do well to learn from.

In all, ""Speedway Junky"" is a failure, and an extremely unlucky one at that.  After sitting on the shelf for two years it finally received a theatrical run at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles starting on August 30, 2001.  Eleven days later the twin towers fell and moviegoing did a nose-dive, ending whatever chance this film had of having a theatrical life.  It's right where it belongs--on DVD, with its excellent commentary giving it a reason for existence.  ** (out of *****) for the film and **** for the commentary.",1096675200,8,5432,4.855748373101952

1708786,3,B000065U4B,"This movie is not nearly as good as L.I.E.  The film runs like a bunch of slides which are out of order.  Jesse can act, but he seems totally homophobic, even heterophobic at times.  He was supposed to give Darryl Hannah an orgasm, but no lips were kissed, no clothes came off, and they both seemed pretty turned off.
He rejects his ""best"" friend's overt come ons, but still gets alone with him at every opportunity.  The music really sucks throughout the movie.  There are cast members from ""Saved By The Bell"" in one scene.  There is a totally unnecessary cameo by the fat kid that was in the ""Sandlot.""  He is no longer fat, and normally he acts a lot better too.
To top it all off, the real villian in the movie is a totally miscast Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  I think he deserved the ""Sandlot"" guy's role as a freaky cowboy john with a stun gun.
The movie was 30 minutes too long, with a tacked on ending!  There is NO closure in this movie whatsoever.  The only real performances came from Darrly Hannah, whom I don't normally like, and the guy who wanted Jesse to be more than a friend.
As many of the reviews show, there are an awful lot of stereotypes.  My problem is that this movie reeked of potential, but some people in the movie, namely Bradford and Hannah, held back from the grittier material that is Van Sant's trademark.  For all of you who buy this movie based on 5 stars, don't say I didn't warn you.  If you want L.I.E., be aware that it involves kids that look much younger and has a very graphic undertone involving child molestors.",1061510400,,1552,4.365853658536586

Speedway Junky is one of those.  The writer/director Nicholas Perry did a pretty good job.  But even with Gus Van Sant as one of the executive producers, it didn't quite come off as edgy enough.
The film stars Jesse Bradford as Johnny, an army brat who has run away from home to become a race car driver.  He's aiming for the NASCAR racing scene in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The problem is that he only gets as far as Las Vegas where his money and all his possessions are stolen.  Here, he meets up Eric, played by Jordon Brower, a young gay hustler who falls in love with Johnny.  Even though Johnny is not gay, the two of them become friends, with Eric helping Johnny out of one scrape after another.  Daryl Hanna is cast as a former prostitute who was a friend of Eric's late mother and helps out the boys. It's a good role for her and shows her acting ability.  In fact, all the acting is really good and the relationship between the two young men portrayed well.
I watched the film with interest but couldn't get into it.  I just didn't seem real enough.  And even though there were several erotic scenes and a peppering of violence, it all seemed like an overblown soap opera and I didn't feel any real emotion.

1708790,5,B000065U4B,"I recently stumbled across this movie while searching online for other movies, and I am very glad that I did. I watched the movie over 24 hours ago and I still find myself thinking about it.
I will not go in-depth about the plot as you will be able to get it from the description of the movie and all the other reviews. What I will say, is there is so much power and meaning put into the relationship that develops between the two young stars (Jesse Bradford and Jordan Brower), I still feel the love that developed. The script is well written, the director did a fantastic job, and the young cast put in extraordinary performances.
This movie is completely moving, no matter what side of the street you walk on. It's a must have!",1053820800,,730,4.375
1708791,4,B000065U4B,"In a word...WOW! Speedway Junkie is quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever viewed. As an avid movie buff, I watch movies from many different perspectives. I look for movies that entertain, educate, cover a broad scale of emotions and leave me wanting more from the performance. Rarely do I see a movie that does all of this...Speedway Junkie does!
Covering the topic of young hustlers in Las Vegas, Speedway Junkie focuses on the emotional toll this type of lifestyle has on its young victims versus that actual work they are doing. Mixed in is the usual cast of supporting characters that live this life and the newcomer struggling to fit in. Additionally, you have the older veteran who has given up the life and shares past wisdom as they struggle to move on. With a dynamic young cast, Speedway Junkie shines as one of Director, Gus Van Sant's films.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas delivers a strong performance that makes it nearly impossible to remember the ""Home Improvement"" days. His role is so different from that of the middle child, that it is almost hard to believe it's the same person.
Daryl Hannah also delivers a strong performance as a strung out dancer (Veronica) who is serving in a maternal role for her friends widowed child. She is believable and displays a wide range of emotion in her role.
Jesse Bradford's role as the naive newcomer is the glue that holds the plot together. His portrayal of the innocent ""Johnny"" truly grabs you from the beginning and makes you want to see him succeed in his mission of getting to N.C.
The star of the film is Jordan Brower in the role of ""Eric"". By the conclusion of the film, I was so emotionally bought into his character that I actually felt he was someone I needed to help. It is rare that I see a movie where the actor moves me in a way that I can't stop thinking about the film days later. Jordan Brower does this. As I look at well-known stars and the projects that they work on today, I am often taken back to some of their earlier films. It is usually this work that shines as their best!. The acting is real and motivated and has some meaning to the person (actor) other than being a job. Jordan, quite possibly, has done his best work with Speedway Junkie. If you see this movie for any reason, see it for the performance delivered by Jordan in the role of ""Eric'.
Overall this is a great movie to see and a very well directed film. Gus Van Sant does a wonderful job with such a rough topic and young talent.",1049932800,7,2485,4.451754385964913
1708792,4,B000065U4B,This film was well made and enjoyable. An excellent story and very well made. Gus has done it again. The acting was good and well timed lines worked powerfully. A good movie investment.,1048636800,,185,4.636363636363637
1708793,5,B000065U4B,"I thought this was an excellent film on a matter that I have rarely ever thought about.  Jordan Brower was very believable in his role, and Jesse Bradford also did a wonderful job.  The tragic ending is heartbreaking, but you still can come away from the movie seeing the beauty of Eric and Johnny's friendship.  I think if there was more money invested into the production of the film, it could have been a big hit.  I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1047945600,,466,4.511904761904762
1708794,5,B000065U4B,"I gained alot of respect for many of these actors.  I already loved Daryl Hannah and Jesse Bradford from past movies but this movie is excellent.  It brings you to so many different emotions.  You get angry with Johnny when Eric goes through the pain of losing someone he loves because Johnny won't just be honest with him.  You basically want Stephen dead throughout the movie because hes a self centered, conceited and rather violent prositute who lets people die for things that he did with no regret.  You gotta love Eric.  I mean hes the one truly honest person that Johnny runs into in Vegas aside from Veronica (Hannah), who is pretty much a mother to Johnny and Eric throughout the film who teaches them from her past mistakes as a hooker in vegas(one in particular time being when johnny shows an interest in being a hustler and she sits in front of him blatantly telling him an un cencored story of a trick in which she was stabbed almost to the point of death.)  These characters in the movie (aside from hannah and bradford <who is rather young as well>) are children.  Pez Boy appears to be about 16 years old and the others are no more than 18 (i believe johnnys about 18).  Their poor kids who sell their bodies to 40 year old men so that they won't starve.  Its also a movie about hope.  Johnny wants to be a race car driver and gains most of his skill by his obsessive playing of the arcade came SPEEDWAY.  He also wants to take Eric with him.  Its also a love story.  Johnny is stait but is obviously in love with Eric and does admit it a time or two though he cannot have a relationship because, well, hes strait.  There is a time though that he yells at Eric ""i DO care about you.  Thats why im here!"". In its rawest form its a story of a kid that left home to make bus fair in vegas with 20 bucks in his pocket to put in the slots who gets robbed and gets stuck there until he can make the money for the bus.  He runs into a group of hustlers outside in the casino parking lot.  And basically what happens.  He sees Stephen prancing around in Nice clothes and a big wad of cash and doesnt know how far stephen goes for that money.  Veronica and Eric tell him that he needs to forget about it because its dangerous (veronica- who use to be a hustler and Eric who still is).  And in the movie you see the transition.  I mean he starts the movie as a country boy playing video games in a diner on his way to Vegas and then you see him as a cut up waif chainsmoking in the car running from the cops in a police chase through the city.
anyways.. just see it.. Its a great movie.  Buy it, Rent it, just see it!",1043107200,3,2625,4.154455445544555

1708797,2,B000065U4B,"I wanted to like this movie.  And I did like the actors and the technical aspects, but the story...the story is typical Hollywood.
I always ask myself after seeing a movie, ""what have I gained by watching this movie?'  I also asked myself ""what did the characters gain from living out the story in the movie?""
My answer to both questions is pretty much the same.  Johnny, the boy who wants to be a racecar driver, would have been better off if he never stopped in Las Vegas.  Johnny makes it to North Carolina despite the people and experiences of Las Vegas...and that's a miracle.  I'm all for new and unusual experiences, but this movie and it's story is best viewed once and forgotten.",1031443200,,688,4.516129032258065

The acting and film making attributes were extremely good, but skirting the issue makes it a flop. My private Idaho was better, but bite the bullet and get Mandragora.",1030665600,,520,4.542553191489362

But after reading the previous reviews, I've changed my opinion...made me go deeper w/my emotions.  It was a great movie.  I won't go into detail because I believe a lot of what I had to say has already been said, thus my change in attitude.  Suffice it to say...I now feel that I could easily fall in love w/Jordan Brower's character - Eric.  Eric reminded me of the time I fell in love w/my best friend, who was straight, and the torment it causes...which I'm sure many gay men can empathize.

The finished product does offer viewers a somewhat accurate portrait of teen runaways, teen drug substance and teen prostitution. Some of the scenes are pretty intense. So much so that they really get under your skin. Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Daryl Hannah star.",1027987200,,592,4.93

7961444,3,B000065U4B,"I was truly expecting something darker. Though the characters felt appropriately unrefined as I guess ""hustlers should"" should. The film left me wanting something more. I had expectations JTT would provide a great dramatic role who instead played an unrealistic, flashy and coy street kid. Based on the life these guys lead I expected the film would have had more intense back stories. Though wanting to be a race car driver is one of those immature believable things that kids go through but rarely achieve. I found much of the film to be predictable outside of one scene (no spoiler here). The hotel rooms, characters and non touristy film locations help keep the gritty street life believable.  I am happy I saw it, but it really didn't need to buy it; though I will watch it again.

If you've ever been to Las Vegas you've can't miss the impoverished or the ""street hustlers"" often at ankle level as one crosses the pedestrian bridges. I'm happy someone has given ""the have not's"" in Las Vegas due recognition. Had the film thrown in a few other struggling characters from this group beyond male hustlers (a badly depicted cartoon character, a veteran or crazy woman) I think the film could have been even more interesting and possibly more emotional.",1449619200,2,1255,4.805555555555555
7961445,4,B000065U4B,"I have been meaning to purchase this movie for years and finally did. I bought this movie after becoming a Jesse Bradford fanatic when I saw him in ""Swimfan"" and decided to buy this movie as it was one of the good and interesting ones he has done.

Now knowing that he was willing to do a so called ""gay kiss"" in the movie ""Heights"" which, it was odd that it was more of a silhouette. Either way, if the kiss was real, it makes you wonder why he couldn't have been willing to do that for this movie? Yes it can be said that he was very much in a different stage of his life at this time, however this movie is often tossed in the gay movie category when really it's only a one sided gay movie with the unrequited love a painful thing to see.

The movie would have been much better if Johnny had opened himself up to the possibility, even if it didn't start to happen until towards the end, maybe it could of happened at the bowling alley, it would have made an extra packing punch to the tragic blow of Eric dying. Another thing I've always questioned is when Johnny leans forward while holding Eric, I've always wondered if that was a hug or a kiss, hidden and clouded due to the actor not wanting to actually pull such a stunt.

Whatever the case, enough about what the movie could have been. The friendship was played well and especially deep towards the end and the acting was alright at best, I feel that Jesse Bradford could have pulled a little more tragedy as Eric died, however during the scenes after, he clearly played a devastated character in pure dazed shock by everything quite well.

The very end, even though Johnny achieves what he wants, it's not much of a happy end, the vibe and the feel of when (Daryl Hannah) sees him on the television is very sad and nostalgic and you get the sense that she might have just fallen in love with him, as much as Eric had fallen in love with him.
