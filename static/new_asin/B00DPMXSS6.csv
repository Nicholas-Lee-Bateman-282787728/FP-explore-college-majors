8596089,4,B00DPMXSS6,"Overall. Or is it over all? This Steve Reeves Documentary is very inspirational. It has a lot of good footage. Sometimes I got a little annoyed when they played audio interviews over clips where Steve was using his real voice. And what a powerful voice he had. Very similar to Rex (This Island Earth) Reason or Rhodes (King Kong Escapes) Reason. The two were brothers. Which really makes me wish Reeves would have gone back to do his own dubbing for his movies. Especially Hercules. Steve Reeves' voice was actually far more impressive than who they used to dub him. I suspect it may have been Peter Fernandez. Watching the weight training footage were my personal favorite parts. Sometimes they had a tendency to linger too long on a few of the movies. And now with footage on You Tube such as Gracie Allen messing up Steve's Mind and his appearance on an Italian Talk show, an updated version is very much in need. But since that more than likely will never happen you better snatch this one up before it becomes either unavailable or way too expensive. One final thing. The running time is actually 1 hr. and 20 minutes.",1399852800,,1123,4.592039800995025
8596090,5,B00DPMXSS6,"I enjoyed this great documentary about Steve Reeves known as Hercules. It talks about his life and shows his accomplishments winning the Body Building titles of Mr. America, Mr. World and Mr. Universe before the Mr. Olympia title existed. It covers his time in the Army during WWII and his movie career as Hercules & Sampson. A great DVD, to own about the legendary Steve Reeves.",1393372800,,379,4.757575757575758
