8424976,5,B004D8W3X2,"Having recently visited this facility with my adult daughters (first time for all of us), I thought this DVD might be a good supplement to what we saw while there. It arrived quickly in in excellent condition.

I'm an Architect (retired), so my visit was focused a bit differently than perhaps most visitors, but it was also an eye-opening experience for all of us. The quality of the exhibits, the amazing variety of sea life and their presentation, the physical environment and the obvious attention to detail made it a worthy visit.

What I really appreciated was the 'Back of the House"" part (the Central Plant) where they operate and monitor the systems that keep it all running. There were some excellent explanations of how the sea water is circulated thru the facility, and the inherent problems and challenges that entails.

This facility owes its' existence primarily to William Hewlett and David Packard (yes, that Hewlett Packard). The only other aquarium I've visited that approaches this one in quality is in Vancouver, BC, but I really think this one is more impressive (larger and more varied). This DVD did not disappoint, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the ocean and all its' inhabitants. Nature PBS programs are routinely excellent, and this one is no exception. If you the reader have children, of any age and you have a chance to visit this aquarium, do it! You and your offspring will not be disappointed! Just make sure you give yourself enuf time (at least 6 hours?)",1395878400,,1515,4.819230769230769
