2885039,4,B000SIWHBE,"Being introduced to the lovely voice of Jeannette Macdonald in her many movies with
Nelson Eddy during the 60 and 70's as her movies were continuously on television, and when they were, my mother had them on. So as a child i heard a angel sing, and
that angel once i grew up i found out it was Jeanette Mcdonald.
When i saw this movie, i was amazed, this is the movie i always wanted to see again,
and voila here it is.  Take this movie with a grain of salt and you should enjoy it.
I found it great, except for the jealous lover....overdone or what...and thats what
i said to myself as a kid 40 years ago.
  Anyway, glad they still have a print going around, and even if its not a gem, its
a very likable movie.

2885040,4,B000SIWHBE,Historically this movie was most intereesting. It was not one of MacDonnald's best but condsidering when and how it waw made it was very  good.,1211500800,3,143,4.72
2885041,4,B000SIWHBE,"This is one of Jeanette MacDonald's first films.  It was produced in the very late 1920s, so it cannot compare to the technical perfection of today (when kids can operate two Blackberries at the same time!) But given that, it is always interesting to see how folks back then viewed our world.  Miss MacDonald was fresh, budding, and though the plot was -- in reflection today -- a smidgeon corny, so was life then, and you can view this about-to-become film Princess as she dawned on Hollywood. It is very interesting to her aficionados.",1199577600,6,537,4.702127659574468
2885042,4,B000SIWHBE,"Jeanette looks smashing in beautiful fur parkas when she heads north of the Arctic Circle in this 1930 musical/action/romance.  Rudolf Friml is credited with the music and after loving ""The Firefly"", I looked forward to this musical set in Norway.  However, the music lacks the Spanish flavor of ""The Firefly"".  But we are treated to special effects when a large dirigible (think Hindenberg) crashes in the ice and the hero is on board.  Both Jeanette in an ice breaker and the hero's brother with a dog team head out to rescue him, both simultaneously arrive just in time and we see Jeanette and her one and only embrace with a backdrop of Northern Lights in black & white.  Well, it's different.  And for fans of Jeanette, it's an early example of the sort of charm that kept her in the forefront of film musicals for many years to come.  Collectors and fans of Jeanette will love it.  It will seem dated to newcomers to her style of romantic musical film.",1193961600,13,958,4.594117647058823
2885043,4,B000SIWHBE,So great to be able to watch the classics ..  Love Jeanette MacDonald she is so great.  Hope you will have more on prime.,1407888000,2,121,4.0

2885046,5,B000SIWHBE,"This is one of Jeanette MacDonald's earlier movies from 1930 and it is worth watching. I have been trying to track down all of her 29 movies to watch. I have made it to 27 and have read that 2 of her movies, ""Paramount On Parade,"" and ""Annabelle's Affairs,"" the footage of her has been lost or very little is left. This movie is fun to watch. The song she sings with John Garrick is beautiful. Joe E. Brown is very funny in this movie. Highly recommend this movie to all Jeanette MacDonald fans. She was a very beautiful and incredibly talented lady!",1395187200,4,550,4.349514563106796
2885047,5,B000SIWHBE,"oh bring back the old memories, another excellent movie with Jeannette McDonald, really enjoy watching  these movies, bring um on..",1392422400,2,131,5.55
2885048,1,B000SIWHBE,"Absolutely the worst movie ever. The acting is horrific, the plot is infantile the singing is absurdly stilted and the sets look like grade school kids did them.",1388016000,,161,4.785714285714286
2885049,4,B000SIWHBE,"If you are a fan of the 20`s, 30`s and 40`s musicals you  wiil like this movie.  If you are a fan of Jeanette MacDonald as I am you will really like this.  I do miss Nelson Eddy as he added so much to her musicals.  Still a solid four star movie.",1388016000,3,246,3.673076923076923
2885050,3,B000SIWHBE,"Stars were knocked off for Kino releasing the 1937 edited version.  Perhaps the full version with the color sequence was not available, but the full version should have been released if it was.  This deserves a corrected DVD release.  Otherwise, this DVD was of good quality.",1329004800,4,275,4.934782608695652
2885051,2,B000SIWHBE,"This is a mildly interesting release, most engaging when Joe E. Brown and Zasu Pitts are on the screen.  Jeanette MacDonald shows why she went on to bigger and better things, while the other men in the cast, including leading man John Garrick, show why they didn't make a lasting impression in Hollywood.

The most disappointing aspects of the Kino Video release are the running time - only 67 minutes - and the black and white image throughout.  The original print runs for 78 minutes, with the final scene in vivid (for the time) color.  This uncut version with the color finale was recently shown on Turner Classic Movies.  Dare we hope for a release of the complete original film?",1323820800,10,684,4.666666666666667

This is a great one! We're still waiting for Maytime to be released.",1307750400,2,103,4.777777777777778
8205403,3,B000SIWHBE,"I love Jeanette MacDonald, but you have to be in the right mood to watch this film. The acting is typical of the early 1930s, so if you watch this with the mind frame of watching a stage play, it's enjoyable. The winning piece here is Jeanette's singing. She had a glorious voice which shines through each song",1488153600,,310,4.362068965517241

8205405,3,B000SIWHBE,"I only rented this to see Joe E Brown. His parts were, to me, the only thing that made this movie good. I wouldn't rent/watch it again.",1469664000,,135,4.037037037037037

8205407,3,B000SIWHBE,OK. Has limitations of early photography.  A little  weak on script.,1455580800,,68,5.090909090909091
8205408,5,B000SIWHBE,"I was very surprised that there was not more singing, given that Jeanette McDonald was the lead, but it was actually kept to a tolerable level.  Good story, great old film.",1454889600,,172,4.548387096774194

8205410,3,B000SIWHBE,This one is deceptive as I bought it assuming Joe . is the main character. WRONG !!! Joe E. Browns role is minimal and there is WAY too much music in this. I feel ripped off by the disc manufacturer.,1430870400,,199,4.0
