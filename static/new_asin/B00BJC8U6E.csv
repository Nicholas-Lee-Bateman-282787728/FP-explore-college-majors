8569634,5,B00BJC8U6E,"Excellent service! I was so happy to finally find this movie. I had it on an old vhs tape that I wore out &
I wasn't able to replace it till now. The 2nd movie in the pkg was an hilarious bonus!",1492387200,,194,3.642857142857143
8569635,5,B00BJC8U6E,"Hilarious! Zany Adventures was just as funny as I remembered years ago whilst Fatal Instinct was new to me but brilliantly done and so very, very funny! Superb!",1484438400,,160,4.75
8569636,5,B00BJC8U6E,"I first saw this film many years ago and since then it has been one of my favourite films.  I am delighted it is now on DVD.  Yes, some people don't like it - but viewed as a gentle, very funny film it is one to enjoy.  The cast obviously had a blast during filming. In addition to the two American lead players, some very fine British actors grace the screen (I love Janet Suzman's scornful 'You Vimp' to her son, King Richard), Robin Nedwell's tuneless singing and Tom Baker (a great talent for looking completely off the wall).  If you want a film to enjoy, relax to without heavy plots, sex and violence this is for you - a great family film.",1483660800,,646,4.227642276422764
8569637,4,B00BJC8U6E,Some sexual content. Good movie anyway.,1464652800,,39,5.666666666666667
8569638,5,B00BJC8U6E,Love this movie too.  The Zany Adventures of RobinHood- Didn't care for the one that came with it- it is made for stupid people & I'm not one of them,1436400000,,149,3.966666666666667
8569639,4,B00BJC8U6E,The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood wasn't very good. But the Fatal Instinct movie is a hoot.,1424736000,,91,4.411764705882353
8569640,5,B00BJC8U6E,"Been after this film (the Robin Hood one) for YEARS.
The picture quality isn't too great - looks like a copy from a VHS tape - but then it's the dialogue and quality of Roy Kinnear that I'm interested in more than ultra sharp vistas.
If you enjoy corny jokes and old film and advert references, made by actors who are obviously having a good laugh as well, then you'll enjoy this film.",1383091200,,385,4.287671232876712
8569641,5,B00BJC8U6E,"I saw it first time  almost 20 years ago on TV. I have been unsuccessfully searching for it for years till now. This is the best Robin Hood parody I ever seen. Don't think about Mel Brooks's ""Men in tights"" which is a stretched parody. This is a completely different league movie. Definitely a must see.",1376265600,,303,4.410714285714286
8569642,5,B00BJC8U6E,"I saw this movie on TV when it first came out and thought it was cleverly written and enjoyed it so much couldn't wait for it to come out on VHS.  Found it on VHS at Blockbuster many years ago and bot it (still a hoot).  Have been waiting for it to come out on
DVD for a very long time so I was happy to finally find it thru Amazon.  The only draw back was it came as a double feature. Don't have much of an interest in the second movie and will get around to watching it eventually.

DVD and case arrived in perfect condition so no complaints there.",1364515200,,550,3.9279279279279278
