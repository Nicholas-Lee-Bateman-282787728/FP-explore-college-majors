1033382,5,630533790X,"The Lakers Showtime era (1979-1991) truly blurred the distinction between sports and entertainment. Although Showtime was the brainchild of Lakers owner Jerry Buss and a team performance by all the Lakers, Magic Johnson was the undisputed director.  This DVD captures many of the spectacular full-court sprints, no-look passes and above-the-rim acrobatics that made Magics Showtime as devastating as it was dazzling.

This DVD also shows another aspect of Magic that helped make Showtime so special: his personality. Despite his uber-competitiveness, he had a warmth and enthusiasm that charmed even some of his opponents. And even though many star athletes treat the media with fear and loathing, Magic embraced it. From the time Brent Musburger introduced him to an NBA audience by asking him to show his smile, Magic took on a celebrity persona that was powerful enough to win him his own star on Hollywoods Walk of Fame. People were visiting Hollywood to see movie stars, but the stars were at the Forum watching Magic.

The two-disc DVD set consists of five features:
(1) An hour-long documentary, Always Showtime, that follows Magics rise from childhood to three-time MVP. It includes footage from his family; an entertaining mix of clips from his high school, college and professional basketball championships; and interviews of many principals, such as Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West, Michael Cooper, Julius Erving and Magic himself.
(2) Magics number retirement ceremony in 1992. Magics thank-you speech shows his poise and charisma when speaking to large crowds.
(3) The full Lakers vs. Clippers game on 10-12-1979. Magic certainly performed well considering this was his first regular-season NBA appearance, but the games star was Lloyd Free who scored 46 points.
(4) The full Lakers vs. 76ers NBA finals game on 5-16-80. Magic considers this championship-clinching victory one of his finest performances ever. He racked up 42 points, 15 rebounds and 7 assists and also played all three positions to help make up for the loss of an injured Kareem.
(5) The full 2-9-1992 NBA All-Star Game.  This is one of the greatest storybook finishes in Magics career. Although he retired three months earlier due to the HIV virus, the fans voted him into the game anyway. So he suited up, scored 25 points with 9 assists and 5 rebounds, and won the game MVP award. It was moving to see so many players from both teams congratulating him.

Given all this, is the DVD worth watching now? Id say yes if you were a Laker fan during Showtime and you want to relive those glory days. If not, theres not much need to look so far into the past. Basketball has become more competitive and exciting in the last 20+ years, and some of todays teams and players can give both Magic and Showtime a run for their money.",1426550400,,2815,4.99360341151386

1033473,5,630533790X,"I live on the East Coast, nearly 3,000 miles away from Showtime, so I didn't get an opportunity to watch many of Magic Johnson's games. After my appetite for sports diminished, I was an unabashed believer that Michael Jordan was the best NBA player of all time. However, after watching Always Showtime, I must now add Magic to the endless argument about the greatest player. Although Magic's teams won 5 NBA finals, he went to the Championship series an astonishing 8 times in his medically-shortened career. He's one of the best that ever played the game, and I didn't realize it until I watched Magic Johnson: Always Showtime.",1363910400,2,628,4.824074074074074

1033559,4,630533790X,"Magic Johnson was the best point guard ever to play the game of basketball.  He was a leader and champion at all levels of the sport, winning titles in high school, college, and the NBA.  ""Always Showtime"" is narrated by Danny Glover and looks back at Magic's career, starting in childhood and high school and then moving on to his years at Michigan State and with the Los Angeles Lakers.

The included footage of Johnson's career is stellar, and interspersed throughout the story are comments by family members, coaches, teammates, and rivals.  Also included is Johnson's February 1992 jersey retirement ceremony at The Forum.

This DVD set contains three full-length games.  No games from the peak of Magic's career in the mid-to-late Eighties are included, but all three are memorable--Johnson's first game as a pro in October 1979; Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals, in which Magic led the Lakers to their first of five titles in the decade; and the 1992 NBA All-Star game, which Johnson played three months after he announced he was HIV-positive.  Viewers of the 1980 game will be surprised at how much running and fast breaking was done in a Finals game back then, and the '92 All-Star game was memorable for the three 3-pointers Magic hit at the end of the game.

The set would be a solid addition to any DVD collection of NBA history.",1328745600,6,1338,4.71244635193133

They really could have done with some more and better footage of Magic's return to the game. There really wasn't anything ):  However the full games that come with this new version are priceless for any Magic fan especially the All Star game filled with the games greatest players(Minus Larry Bird who was injured) all having a last shot at him and then paying tribute by stopping the game.

It would have been great to have an additional DVD like Larry Bird's or Ultimate Michael with actual games of the great man, not just highlights.  While a good addition, not essential.",1124668800,8,505,4.629213483146067

1033665,5,630533790X,"This review is for those who are deciding whether to upgrade from the videotape version to the DVD version.  It's not worth it.  That was the reason I bought the DVD, I already had the videotape, but was intrigued by the additional footage of Magic's comeback to the NBA in 1996.  The only difference between the two is the additional 10 minutes at the end of the DVD.  The rest of the program preceding the end of the DVD is the same.  The extra scenes on the DVD version goes as followed: Magic announcing his retirement from the NBA in 1991 due to HIV; his 1992 All-Star Game performance in Orlando, Florida; the 1992 Dream Team in the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; Magic's work within the community with his Magic's Theatres; Magic's comeback to the NBA in 1996; the end.  That sounds like a lot of material, but each segment was shown in minimal time, giving only a brief description of each event.  I bought this DVD with the intention of watching additional footage of Magic's comeback to the NBA in 1996, but all I saw was a minute or two of interviews and game footage, too short for this DVD to worth buying to replace the videotape.  The additional footage on the DVD are too short to enjoy, I felt cheated.  It's almost as if NBA Entertainment put together that part at the last minute before release and didn't give enough thought and time into it.  If you already own the videotape version, I wouldn't bother buying the DVD version because you are not really missing anything.",1119571200,13,1497,4.5315985130111525

7889797,4,630533790X,"Disc 1 contains the main documentary (1 hr 3 min) and also the number retirement ceremony (25 min) from the Great Western Forum in the early 90's that also had Larry Bird in attendance. The main body of the documentary was made in the 80's and feels a bit dated but still does a decent job of exploring his early life growing up in Lansing and then onto his high school/college days and finally his NBA career filled with championships and amazing fast-break plays.

Tacked on at the end of the documentary is a brief glimpse of his time on the Dream Team in the Summer of 1992 and also his return to the NBA in early 1996. Overall the documentary feels a bit short and rushed at just over an hour for someone who had such an amazing career. Certain events were just glossed over(such as his return). and others weren't even covered(his brief time coaching the Lakers). Disc 2 contains 3 full games(Lakers @ Clippers in San Diego 1979, Lakers @ 76er's Game 6 NBA Finals 1980, 1992 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando).

The game in San Diego was Magic's 1st game ever in the NBA. Game 6 in Philly is where Magic took over at center without Kareem and took the NBA crown as a rookie with the Lakers. And the 92 All-Star game was supposed to be Magic's last game(at the time). Overall this is a nice collection especially with the jersey retirement ceremony and the three full games.",1437264000,4,1374,4.426877470355731
