8161869,4,B000LE175C,"As a teacher, I often hear the students talk of the popular anime series and except for a few exceptions, I usually don't follow the latest in anime creations. By chance, I caught the first few episodes of Spider Riders on a Sunday TV show and enjoyed the pure escapism the series offered. Now, I'll have a series to tell my kids about. As with all ""Children's"" cartoons, there are the slight puns and play on words for adults to appreciate, as well as the action, doe eyed heroes, and bizzare villians which will please the younger set. While not on a par with The Last Airbender or Neon Genesis, I like this series because there is a solid story that captivates the viewer from episode to episode. On a side note, it was interesting to discover the English version voice of Prince Lumen is the same boy who voiced a minor role in Skyland, a fantastic anime I happened to find on my Xbox video marketplace. I suppose I also appreciate the series since I graduated from the University of Richmond: Home of the SPIDERS! Check the series out.",1265760000,3,1040,4.478947368421053
8161870,5,B000LE175C,"Spider Riders details the jouney of our young hero, Hunter Steel, and he follows stories his grandfather told him and seeks out a mystic place called the inner world, hidden deep within the earth.

Clues to his destiny begin to unfold as he makes friends with Corona, a spider rider, and is invited to join their elite ranks as a defender of the realm. If you like Rave Master and Naruto, you definately want to check out Spider Riders!",1188518400,4,568,4.633663366336633
8161871,5,B000LE175C,"Spider Riders is an awesome anime with superb visuals, a catchy opening and an interesting plot. Hunter Steele is an eleven year old boy who falls into the Inner World and becomes a Spider Rider. This is one of the best animes I've ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who watches anime.",1180915200,2,296,4.4
