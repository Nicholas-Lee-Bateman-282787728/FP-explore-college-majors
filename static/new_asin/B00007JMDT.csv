7976919,1,B00007JMDT,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product it supports well documented pedophiles.",1456704000,,814,4.9416058394160585

7976921,5,B00007JMDT,"I just saw this video viewing on TBN.  It was so terrific that I want to buy it for my 4 year old along with all the other episodes.  It contains bible scripture, songs and related stories in a fun and entertaining manner that young children can understand.  The whole thing is animated which really appeals to the kids.  They think that they are just watching cartoons, but they are getting life lessons at the same time.  I was very impressed by this video.",1047081600,4,459,4.416666666666667
