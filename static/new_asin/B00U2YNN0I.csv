7028546,1,B00U2YNN0I,"This movie was very graphic and difficult to watch. It was poorly filmed and acted. The best part about this movie was that it ended, and I would recommend this to NOBODY.",1436918400,4,171,4.375
7028547,5,B00U2YNN0I,"Might sometimes feel like a Lifetime movie... but only more realistic and dark ---- and worth seeing for that reason alone. There were a couple of disturbing moments too, but if you have been affected by a bully on the web  or in school, etc. this might give you a glimpse into the full picture of what creates these types of ""monsters"" and I was pleased to see the filmmakers not pull away from the dark and violent and sometimes sexual themes that often are part of teen life and how they come about and more important --- the adults roles in the bully issue and how they sometimes add fuel to the fire by doing nothing or by their ignorance of teenagers emotions.",1436832000,,666,4.370967741935484
7028548,4,B00U2YNN0I,"This plays like a dark, R-rated version of an AfterSchool Special. Raw, uncompromising and very well done for an independent film, was not expecting a great deal, but found myself drawn in and caring about the ensemble of characters. Recommended highly, will make you think about the many social and personal factors that create bullies in our schools.",1436832000,3,352,5.086206896551724
7028549,1,B00U2YNN0I,"A terrible mess of writing, acting (I should say ""overacting""), and lighting.  For the life of me, I don't know why I would ever mention lighting in a review, but it was the very first thing that I saw, and it made me go ""oh-oh."")",1436140800,2,230,4.111111111111111
7028550,4,B00U2YNN0I,"Much better  than most low/no budget productions.  The direction was competent.  The screenplay was believable and clever.  The acting was also good.  The characters were engaging and I was able to develop feelings for them, which is rare for straight to DVD productions.  I would watch it again.",1463788800,2,296,5.0625
7028551,3,B00U2YNN0I,"Three friends have a falling out at school after one of them is bullied, and their lives are slowly torn apart as the they fall deeper into a twisted web of hate, ignorance, and revenge - where it turns out no one is truly innocent - all leading to a disturbing and violent conclusion. This movie barely made it to a 3 for several reasons. First the positives, though. for the very small budget this must have had they did a good job. The subject of bullying is well represented here, if not a little extreme. Alexander Fraser as Devon as the victim of the bullying is pretty good, too, Darren Ackerman as the bully is pretty good also. Now the negatives. Adrienne King (first Friday the 13th survivor) really awful as an actress then and still is now, REALLY. The other performers pretty bad too. In both of these instances the girlfriends were mainly responsible for all the trouble (really) they egged on their respective boyfriends to the inevitable bad conclusions.",1460764800,,970,4.645348837209302

7028555,4,B00U2YNN0I,"People that rate this a one, were most likely bullies themselves, then grew up to be cops.",1448409600,,90,4.352941176470588

8704312,1,B00U2YNN0I,"I usually give movies about bullying a higher rating than they actually deserve, simply because they call attention to a serious problem. The people who made this movie, however, weren't interested in drawing attention to bullying so much as cashing in by sensationalizing the subject (although I seriously doubt the movie earned much money - it deserves the one-star rating for lack of quality). The worst thing about the movie is that it basically punishes the bully's victims for trying to fight back. They were simply trying to get the bully to stop. They didn't know the full story, which was the part where the movie gets completely off track. It is a fact that what happened to the bully early in life has been known to lead to violence later in life (trying to avoid spoilers here), but the chances of something like this happening under these circumstances are a million to one. It's just a badly written and badly acted movie. I mean, the principal of the school getting hysterical - AT WORK - because her son was gay? Berating a teacher in front of students because he was gay? So much bad acting, so much scenery chewing, just don't bother with this one, folks. There are other, much better movies on the subject.",1502496000,,1225,4.675925925925926

8704314,1,B00U2YNN0I,NO WAY -- B movie or college project,1494547200,,36,3.625
8704315,4,B00U2YNN0I,I expected something different. Watched the entire movie. I too was bullied as a child. My younger days were marred with bullies. I hope they are all dead now.,1493164800,,159,4.517241379310345
8704316,5,B00U2YNN0I,This movie is sweet for not having any known actors in it. Keep up the good work!,1491004800,,81,3.823529411764706
8704317,2,B00U2YNN0I,"I was really impressed with the box cover.  It's raw, edgey and makes you notice the movie, enough to click on it and check it out.  Unfortunately budget has nothing to do with how bad this film is.  It's simply a lame script that as always makes the entire production look bad.  I laughed throughout the film especially during the rape scene at end when the girlfriend is still doing lines of coke; that is pure genius I'll tell ya! The father crying when he tries to call his son is the best little scene in the movie.",1489708800,,520,4.275510204081633
8704318,1,B00U2YNN0I,I am Adrienne King fan because she was in the original Friday The 13th movie. But she was a lot younger back then. I didn't think this was all that great. It was totally different from the other bully movies I've seen. It went downhill fast when it came to the end.,1486771200,,265,4.115384615384615
8704319,2,B00U2YNN0I,"Not well acted - Lots of loose ends that don't make any sense - Obviously This film was very very low budget, and no scripted very well.",1484438400,,136,4.074074074074074
8704320,3,B00U2YNN0I,"Great, though over the top performances by Adrienne King and Daren Ackerman help the movie as a decent viewing.",1475366400,,111,4.894736842105263
