8108840,4,B000EF7XE2,"This is a low budget movie from 1996 starring Nicollete Sharidan (who would eight years later star in Desperate Housewives as Edie), she plays Anna. a drunk woman who isn't a great mother of three young daughters, and doesn't pay her bills, meaning she's about to loose their house.  Faye Dunaway the other main name on the DVD case plays her mother, who looks down her nose at her daughter and seems to be a member of a different social class, although her screen time is rather limited.  One day Garrett and Donna move next door and seem to be a godsend to lessening her responsibilities and problems.  Unfortunately for her they plan on kidnapping her daughters and raising them as their own and convince two of the kids to take a ride in their new car when visiting a park, while the older daughter refuses and insists on waiting for their mother to return.  The police aren't real keen of helping Anna, especially since her mother informs them she swapped her kids for a holiday (classy woman).  But after a while an old man cop believes her and even though the other cops secretly are trying to give her the hint to get lost, he sticks by her after setting her straight with convincing her if she wants the kids back she's got to get her act together with ""If you ask me, it looks like you've been rode hard and put up wet."" Meanwhile the older of the two girls isn't behaving the way Garrett expects her to, so he's having to use the belt more and more.  Donna is beginning to think kidnapping these two wasn't such a great idea but Garrett tells her if she tries to break up his family she's going home in a box.  The rest of the movie is a bit uneventful.  I won't give away what happens, but it's not brilliant movie plot telling stuff.

Nicollette Sheridan's over the top fake southern American accent (she is from the UK after all) is a little distracting. Neither the Anna of her mother were going to even win a ribbon for all participants in a mother of the year competition if they had been nominated, but if you've got an hour and half you need to occupy, you can get less budget priced movies than this one.  This one still in letterbox format or whatever you call the style before widescreen with black lines down the right and left of the picture.  This is very loosely based on a true story, the actual true story would have made a more interesting movie, with just one kid taken (who left a note for her mother) into the woods for 12 days by someone who thought she'd end up dead if they left her with the mother.",1466899200,,2534,4.3474576271186445
8108841,4,B000EF7XE2,This was a gift even though I have seen it. The movie was of a different kind but was very good to watch. It makes you think of how true this can be. This is not for young children. I just don't know why overseas regions are so much less expensive as here in the USA.,1412121600,,267,3.7857142857142856
