8032041,4,B0002US4ZG,"This is a great video series. I bought all three ...Fire, Earth and Spirit about 2 years ago. I use all of these techniques found in these videos. Really nice tips to integrate into your work. The videos are beautiful with amazing footage and music. About the only problem is they are so well done they put you in a trance while your trying to watch them, lol. I would suggest any new therapist buy all 3 of these videos. You will be doing yourself and your clients a huge favor! The only reason I gave 4 stars is there is no info given on what is fascia, what is deep tissue massage, contraindications or working to protect your own body. I always love to hear other therapists take on these issues. But regardless its a fantastic series.",1329004800,,739,4.36231884057971

8032043,2,B0002US4ZG,"I was all set to love this video due to the excellent work I had seen in my previous purchase of the ""Mastering Chair Massage"" video but I ended up getting very frustrated with the Integrative Massage - Earth video.

The video was set outdoors under the strong sunlight and many times I found that due to the camera-man's position the massage therapist would end up casting her own shadow over her own hands and I couldn't get a good view of her hand/finger position.

I wish I could give this video a better review but the view of the hand stroke positions being obstructed due to the shadows annoyed me greatly.",1233446400,,613,4.464285714285714

8032045,5,B0002US4ZG,This video presents very useful and practical information for the practicioner on setting up a massage therapy session for the client who may have medical issues or desire deep tissue concerns that the normal protocol does not address. It covers practical steps on draping and positioning. This has been especially helpful for my own clientele who are either infirmed or have advanced pregnancies. It also addresses lateral and saggital areas and provides some excellent moves for working with the rotator cuff area while the client is still in supine position. Excellent!,1183939200,,572,5.2967032967032965
