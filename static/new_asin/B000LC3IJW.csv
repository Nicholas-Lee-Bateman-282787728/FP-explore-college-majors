2702369,1,B000LC3IJW,"Well, let's make no mistake here - Vengeance was a horrendous pay-per-view. It would have been lacklustre on free television, but to be asked for money to endure this is ridiculous. Ironically, the 'best' (i.e. least horrific) match on here is the one that wasn't scheduled - CM Punk vs Johnny Nitro.

Now, here's the reason you should never buy another WWE product as long as you live. WWE is an evil, lying conglomerate of misinformation. This was the event where Chris Benoit was supposed to win his ECW Championship, but he was at home going nuts from multiple concussions, injuries, drug-dependencies and bereavements, to the point where he snapped and killed his wife and son and then himself. Although I obviously feel sympathy for him, nothing will make this act all right because he should have done something beforehand. He was responsible for his actions and he's probably best left ignored in the future.

However, it is one thing to ignore Benoit and another to erase him, which is what WWE did here. They erased the fact Nitro wasn't supposed to wrestle, and they erased the massive chants of ""We want Benoit"" that took place during the match because they think they have the right to re-write history. They've done it before, when they changed Hogan's crowd reaction at Royal Rumble 1992 so he was cheered, they did it with Vince McMahon's own success on television networks, and they did it with Ultimate Warrior.

This, quite frankly, makes me sick and is an attitude infinitely more reprehensible than an unfortunate soul who messed up and paid the price with his life and the lives of his innocent family. I am disgusted by this. Do not buy this, do not buy anything the WWE create until they get their act together on this, and (perhaps more importantly) do not buy any of their events since Backlash 2007 (except, perhaps, Great American Bash) because they've all been terrible from a wrestling standpoint.

In short, I hate everyone involved in this. It's revolting.",1190419200,3,1988,4.821114369501466
2702370,1,B000LC3IJW,"In WWEs constant efforts to erase Benoit from their past, when Johnny Nitro comes out (who was Benoit's replacement that fatal weekend) the commentary has been removed explaining that Benoit was missing for 'personal reasons'. I am done buying any WWE DVD products with edited footage just so they can recreate their history. There has been talk of removing Benoit matches from the proposed Summerslam box set, the WCCW DVD was pushed back 4 months to edit it, and many other superstar's bio DVDs will be lacking some of their own better matches because Benoit was in them. What Benoit did was absolutely, unequivocally unforgivable, but he still has a place in wrestling history. Leave the product as is -- even the matches where Benoit chokes out his opponents. It doesn't mean we support Benoit, it means we support the WWE product and the memorable moments it has given us.",1187654400,3,877,4.8533333333333335

1. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch vs. The Hardy Boyz for the World Tag Team Titles- This was an okay match but was no were near there last two matches together. For me I had already seen these two teams go at it so it was not watching anything new. Also just something was missing from this match. Nice to see Murdoch and Cade keep there titles. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs  Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. Match Rating 6.5/10.
2. Chavo Guerrero vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for the cruiserweight title- This was a decent match. I liked the way they did a tribute before the match for Eddie. This was another match that if it was the given enough time would be able to develop. Still I would say this was above the first match of the night. Just some high flying action and a couple of near falls. Winner and still crusierwieght champ Chavo Guerrero. Match Rating 7/10.
3. Jonny Nitro vs. CMP for the ECW Title- This was supposed to be Chris Beniot vs. CMP which was a dream match but Beniot could not be there cause of family issues so Nitro took his place. At first I was a little disappointed with this but the match acculaty started to go well. This involved some solid wrestling. Very good work by both men. Winner and new ECW Champ Jonny Nitro. Match Rating 7/10.
4. Santino Marreli vs. Umaga for the ITC Title- This was an absolute terriable match First off Santino needs to get better in the ring. Secondly what is the point of letting him hold the ITC Title if he is going to job to everyone every single time. I knew this was going to be a squash from the start but what made it worse was it ended in a DQ because Umaga did not break a 5 count. Skip this match. Winner and still ITC Champ Santino Marreli. Match Rating 1/10.
5. MVP vs. Rick Flair for the US title- This was another okay match. A couple of years ago I would have been excited for this match but it just seems that flair has lost a little bit of his step. This was just another solid wrestling amtch with a lot of old school wrestling by both MVP and Flair. Again more time could have done this match good because it was rushed. Winner and still US Champ MVP. Match Rating 6.5/10.
6. Duece and Domino vs. Sgt. Slaughter and Jimmy The Super Fly Snuka for the WWE Tag Team Titles- I was kind of looking forward to this match but it turned out to be a disaster. First off once we found out who the opponents were we knew that to 60 year olds were not winnig the match. Second the match was only 6 minutes long and it was just slow and boring. Not much to say but that. Winners and still WWE Tag Team champs Duece and Domino. Match Rating 2/10.
7. Edge of Batista for the World Heavywieght Title- Finally we get something good. I did not know if this was going to succeed but it did to a certain point. The beginng was contolled by Edge with just some solid wrestling which we have seen before but than they stepped it up. There cam all the near falls. Edge got DQ and long came out and restarted the match and I was almost possative Edge was going to lose the title. They fought back in the ring it broke to the outside and Batista hit a sick Batistia hit a sick Batistia bomb on the floor but ended getiing counted out because he rolled Edge in the ring first. My match of the night and not a bad one. Winner and Still WHC Edge. Match Rating 8.5/10.
8. Melina vs. Candice Michelle for the WWE Women's Title- Well here is yet another bad match. Now I was not expecting this to be good and it wasn't so I was not to surprised. Not much to say but good for Canidce to finally win the title but after that you can skip this one. Winner and new WWE Womens champ Candice Michelle. Match Rating 2/10.
9. John Cena vs. Mick Foley vs. Randy Orton vs. King Booker vs. Bobby Lashley for the WWE Title- This I was expecting to save the show but it didn't. Don't get me wrong this was not a bad match but it was to rushed and did not live up to the hype I had for it. There were some nice spots including some nice chair shots and a nice F-U through the table. Again at only 10 minutes long it was rushed and they could at least have added an extra 15 minutes considering the PPV is not supposed to end till 11 o clock. Once again Cena wins and it almost seems like its not worth watching anymore cause we already know who is going to win the match which sucks. Winner and still WWE champ John Cena. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give WWE vengeance  2007 a grade of 47.5/80 which is a 59% which means this is an awful ppv. Now in my opinion this PPV did nto live up to the hype to many matches and the bad ppv trend continues with wwe. Just to many matches and save your money on this dvd. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1183161600,11,4840,4.156716417910448

8161003,2,B000LC3IJW,"I was always a fan of the VENGEANCE PPV series.  Somehow, even the ones that weren't too good just managed to entertain me enough.  I don't think the WWE did this on purpose, but they always had a paying customer from me when the June/July event came around.

In June 2007, I chose not to purchase the event because I simply wasn't wowed by any CLASH OF THE CHAMPIONS cards that WCW produced.  Frankly, I didn't trust WWE this time.  Aside from the horrible tragedy that occurred with the Benoit family in Atlanta, this Texas PPV wasn't gonna click even with a Rabid Wolverine around.

1) World Tag Team Championships
The Hardys v. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (champions)
---This was an interesting feud that sadly never got off the ground.  The two teams had exceptional matches at BACKLASH and JUDGMENT DAY.  Cade & Murdoch spent months trying to play fair and square, but just before this PPV, they finally revealed themselves to be rulebreakers fans suspected they were.  Of the PPV ""trilogy"" between these two, this one is easily the least good.  It's not too bad, but like the angle, it just never gets off the ground.
""6.5 / 10""
_____________________________________

2) Cruiserweight Championship
Jimmy Wang Yang v. Chavo Guerrero (champion)
---Some of the best WWE Cruiserweight matches, particularly Chavo's, always satisfy you in ways you don't expect.  Yang & Chavo deliver plenty of high-flying offense and aerial displays that excite the crowd.  But the best Cruiserweights can pace themselves to deliver a sound mat-based contest.  Yang and Chavo succeed at this as well.  This title bout is kind of a sad occasion, because soon after this event, the WWE ended this division.  Too bad, because the Cruiserweight division was on the rise again.
""7.0 / 10""
_____________________________________

3) ECW World Title
CM Punk v. Johnny Nitro
---Okay, we all know that this was supposed to be Chris Benoit versus CM Punk.  Frankly, that match would've been a classic among classics.  But, I gotta give WWE some credit for not only making the best of a bad situation, but Johnny Nitro's title victory re-elevated his WWE career after months of being out of RAW's spotlight.  But more importantly, this is actually a pretty solid match between Punk and Nitro.  I'm sure the crowd didn't get into this match very much, but hopefully a DVD viewing or YouTube search will give this ECW Title Match the respect it deserves.
""7.0 / 10""
_____________________________________

4) Intercontinental Championship
Umaga v. Santino Marella (champion)
---Here is where VENGEANCE 2007 runs into some serious problems.  Why in the world Santino had the belt was puzzling to begin with?  Why the match is less than 2 minutes is disrespect on so many levels, especially because this is NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS!  I don't mind DQ finishes or matches that push storylines, but this was not the way to do it.  As amusing as it is to see the crowd cheer Umaga's postmatch beatdown of our Italian babyface, this match is garbage.  Period.
""2.0 / 10""
_____________________________________

5) United States Championship
M.V.P. (champions) v. Ric Flair
---Montel Vontavious Porter is an unorthodox but gifted performer.  Ric Flair's charisma alone can get him through about anything, and his in-ring skills weren't too shabby.  But these two just didn't click on this night.  The counters and reversals weren't very crisp, and both men's offense looked unconvincing.  I enjoyed the match these two had at ROYAL RUMBLE 2008, but this one put another dark cloud on an event that was full of them.
""4.5 / 10""
_____________________________________

6) WWE Tag Team Championships
Deuce 'N Domino (champions) v. Sgt. Slaughter & Jimmy Snuka
---This is another bad match for obvious reasons.  ""Superfly"" doesn't look very good in the ring anymore, and Slaughter's in-ring abilites are on par with Jerry Lawler (not bad, but not great).  What sucks the mot about this is that weeks of SMACKDOWN hype said that Deuce 'N Domino didn't know who their opponents were going to be.  Of all the teams WWE could've picked to challenge the title holders, WWE instead throws a disappointing nostalgic suckerpunch.  Well, at least Rick Martel and Tony Garea got to fend off the champions after the match.
""4.5 / 10""

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Batista (Last Chance At Edge's Title)
v. Edge (World Heavyweight champion)
---Finally!  Not only do we get breath of fresh air, but this happens to be one my favorite matches of 2007.  These two slowly but surely improved their PPV matches together in the months before this event.  But on this night, they delivered a match that highlighted both men's strengths, told a compelling in-ring story, and had a very upsetting-in-a-good-way finish.  If you choose to not check out this DVD, this match is available on Edge's DECADE OF DECADENCE DVD.  But if you feel like watching some of the other highlights from VENGEANCE, I'm sure this will be your favorite match of the night.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________

8) Women's Championship
Melina (champion) v. Candice Michelle
---These two ladies went on to have a much better match at GREAT AMERICAN BASH, starting what I believe to be the rejuvenation of the Women's division that lasts to this day.  But sadly, Melina and Candice couldn't get their act together at this event.  Par for the course, right?  Basically, the match is too short to entertain the crowd, and the moves are too flubbed to even forgive the time length.  Man, this review is getting depressing to type...
""4.0 / 10""
_____________________________________

9) Open Challenge For The WWE Championship
Bobby Lashley v. Mick Foley v. King Booker
v. Randy Orton v. John Cena (champion)
---""Open Challenge"" basically means a one-fall match that features only former champions.  The match itself is pretty exciting while it lasts.  Each of the five competitors (even Foley) get to look very good in the main event.  You know the routine, right?  False finishes, double teams, everyone gets to pull off their finishers?  There's nothing wrong with the familiar elements in this particular match.  The reason I'm giving this a fairly low score is that the match is way too short.  I think it lasted only about 15 minutes.  Given the talent involved and the name of the PPV, I think we deserved more than that.  Like the Lashley/Cena main event at GREAT AMERICAN BASH a month later, this Open Challenge feels like the first half of a classic was skipped, and we only got to see the fast-paced second half.
""6.5 / 10""

VENGEANCE 2007: NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS was the last event to be named ""Vengeance"".  It'll probably stay that way because this was the weekend where Nancy Benoit and Daniel Benoit lost their lives to a man whose mind and spirit were clearly somewhere else.

But let's say you can forget about all of the Benoit horrors that took place weekend.  Let's say that you can forget about the booking change in the ECW World Title Match.  Let's say that you only care about the 3-hour PPV.  Well...VENGEANCE 2007: NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS simply isn't a good card.  There are many legends at ringside, but I'm sure they were disappointed by some of the match quality they witnessed.  The WWE edited out of the ""We Want Benoit"" chants, but left in the embarssingly awful ""Who Killed Vince McMahon?"" & ""FBI Investigation"" recaps & promos.

If you want to see some of the better matches, like the opening World Tag Titles Match, or ECW World Title Match, or Batista/Edge, here's what I suggest.  Pick up Edge's 3-disc set (full of great matches), and check out other PPVs featuring the Hardys and Cade/Murdoch or Punk & John Morrison.  Those other encounters are better anyway.",1238025600,,7785,4.977536793183579
8161004,3,B000LC3IJW,"Vengeance 07 is one DVD I don't actually own, nor did I watch it on PPV. I did however borrow it from my uncle, who had bought it.

And that's all you need to do with this one. It's not worth the buy, but it's worth a rental at the least.

My main problem with this PPV was it was rushed and a lot of the title matches (as all 9 matches were title matches) were added at the last second because the WWE hadn't thought about who would be facing who. This PPV idea is a good one, but needs more thought and effort put into it.

Why 3 stars then if I thought it was badly booked? Because there were a couple of decent matches on here. Rundown:

World Tag Team Title Match: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (champions) vs The Hardys (Matt Hardy & Jeff Hardy)
A good opener to the show and one of the decent matches of the night. Cade & Murdoch and the Hardys had some other good matches and this was up there with them. Great teamwork and some good moves. (3.5/5)

Cruiserweight Title Match: Chavo Guerrero (champion) vs Jimmy Wang Yang
This match needed more enthusiasm from the crowd as the cruiserweights were good wrestlers (the title's been retired now though). Jimmy Wang Yanh is a great wrestler and he worked well with Chavo. Apart from that though, this match was just average. (3/5)

ECW Title Match: Johnny Nitro vs CM Punk
This match was to determine the new ECW champion as the belt had been vacated by Bobby Lashley after he was drafted to Raw. Johnny Nitro was a replacement for Chris Benoit and the crowd showed their disdain for the fact Benoit wasn't there (the chants for him were on the DVD I saw, I don't know about others). Nitro went on to win the vacant title, which was a let down as Punk had been working towards it. Still, these two had good chemistry and a decent match was had. (3/5)

Intercontinental Title Match: Santino Marella (champion) vs Umaga
This was back before Santino became a comedy act and when he was the IC champion. This match wasn't worth it because Umaga got disqualified because he wouldn't stop punching Santino in the corner. Boring match. (2/5)

United States Title Match: MVP (champion) vs Ric Flair
I have all the respect in the world for Ric Flair, but him and MVP didn't have a good match here. It was slow and dull and dragged on. Another waste of time. (2/5)

WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Deuce & Domino (w/ Cherry) vs Sgt. Slaughter & Jimmy Snuka
This is where you can tell this match was made right before the PPV went to air. Slaughter & Snuka have no business challenging for titles anymore and this was just a easy way to have a title match and keep the titles on D&D. An absolutely boring match. (1/5)

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (champion) vs Batista
Finally, a decent match! Although this one had a sucky ending (with Batista getting counted out), it was actually decent. Edge and Batista both looked strong. The ending ruined it, but overall this was a good match. (3.5/5)

Women's Championship Match: Melina (champion) vs Candice Michelle
Believe it or not, this was actually match of the night for me! Why? Because a title actually changed hands. Candice worked so hard and looked impressive. She has really improved over the months and the crowd actually seemed into the fact that she won the title. A good match and it was great to see somebody that was actually genuinelly thrilled to win a title (Candice's reaction when she won was just adorable and heart warming). (4/5)

WWE Five-Way Title Match: John Cena (champion) vs Mick Foley vs Bobby Lashley vs Randy Orton vs King Booker (w/ Queen Sharmell)
I can understand triple threat matches and fatal four ways, but five people in one title match is just too much. John Cena had already had gone through a four way match and now they were sticking him in with 4 other people? And why was Mick Foley in this match? I love the guy (he's a great commentator on SD) but he shouldn't have been going for the title. This was all over the place, they tried to fit too much into it. I'm glad John won as he's my favourite wrestler. But overall, this was just confusing. (3/5)

Overall, not a strong showing for Vengeance. Thankfully, 2008's Vengeance (Night Of Champions) was much stronger. This isn't a needed PPV and you should only buy it if you're trying to complete a 2007 collection.",1216166400,,4315,4.4815286624203825

World Tag Team Championship:
Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (Champions) V. The Hardys
Nice little opener here with good action though out. if only given more time it could be really good..like their match @ Backlash. Cade & Murdoch retain. **3/4

WWE Cruiserweight Championship:
Chavo Guerrero (Champion) V. Jimmy Wang Yang
Good match with some cool spots in it. Yang is very underrated in my book. Guerrero retains with the Frogsplash. ***1/4

Match for the Vacant ECW Championship:
CM Punk V. Johnny Nitro
Chris Benoit was suppose to be in his match but he was too busy murdering his family and killing himself!!! Harsh. The crowd was chanting Benoit's name the whole match. This match could have been better if Nitro wasn't in it. There two really don't work well together at all. Nitro wins the title for some stupid reason. ** I guess

WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Santino Marella (Champion) V. Umaga
um...Marella wins by DQ and you really don't want to see this match. DUD. I really don't know what they saw in Santino, he isn't that good and never will be.

WWE United States Championship:
MVP (Champion) V. Ric Flair
Solid match that could have been better. MVP retains by taking a page out of Flair's playbook. ***1/4

WWE Tag Team Championship:
Deuce N' Domino (Champions) V. Sgt. Slaughter & Jimmy Snuka
Deuce is in there with his dad, Snuka, not Sgt. and he pins him for the win! Cool I guess, the match was barely watchable. 3/4*

Last Chance Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:
Edge (Chaampion) V. Batista
If Batista loses, he will never again be able to get a title shot as long as Edge is Champion. Well, the best match that there two have had so far. Alot better than Judgment Day and One Night Stand. Cheap Ending to protect Batista. Edge wins by countout and Batista is heartbroken. ***1/2. Good match

WWE Women's Championship:
Melina (Champion) V. Candice Michelle
A so-so match with Candice winning the title. *

John Cena (Champion) V. Mick Foley V. Randy Orton V. Bobby Lashley V. King Booker
Great match. Match of the night. Needed more time to be in that awesome range. Still a great match with Cena winning after FUing Foley. ***3/4

overall, an above average show. Good idea, but with 9 matches, some matches had to be rushed. The only title change was the Women's title. Interesting. On a personal note: I'm back with all new reviews some new and old PPVs. If you haven't notice, I have deleted most of my reviews. I did about 90% of them by memory and that's not fair to the event to do that. So I deleted everything from 2002-Present so I can make a more fair review for every PPV event. This is the first of my new and improved reviews. I will re-do all of my reviews, I just don't know when. So thanks and I will be back soon with another review. Peace.",1215216000,,2906,4.647173489278752
8161006,2,B000LC3IJW,"Normally on my reviews I do a match by match review but I'm not even going to waste my time here & get straight to the point.  This PPV only proved two things, WWE has TOO MANY PPV's on their schedule and that they have too many championships to make each one seem important to people (and more importantly, the creative team themselves).  This PPV came after One Night Stand (which happened in the same month) and only one week after their draft lottery.  Every match on here was either one of the following: very slow & boring, a squash match less than 5 mins. (Umaga's match), or an average unmemorable performance.  And half the matches didn't give us a reason to care about them because again this PPV was booked at the last min...like Duece & Domino fighting Slaughter & Snuka.  And all of this is doesn't even include the Chris Benoit incident that weekend that overshadowed everything that happened at the end of the night...to the point where all references to him are removed from the ECW Title match.

The only positives I can say is that some of the matches are watchable which is why I gave this 2 stars but bottom line is that this ranks on the same level as Judgment Day (which I also gave two stars) in that there isn't anything special about this PPV & you aren't missing out of anything if you can't watch this event.  I recommend for a rental at best.",1190937600,2,1370,4.412698412698413
