8689173,5,B00PTUB6K4,"Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist was one series that only grabbed my interest after watching the trailer for the anime series before it aired. The anime description did not offer a good mental image of what the series would turn out like even though the anime series poster for the series did look appealing.

The anime description gave off a faint Black Butler vibe and so did the promotional trailer. So Black Butler being as popular with much of the public as with me thought it would be interesting to see where Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist headed.

William Twining is a privileged young man until his deceased parents fortune is squandered by his uncle. He accidentally awakens an ages old demon from his past who is drawn to him because of a pact they made years ago when he was King of Israel as King Solomon. While it seems rather strange he is Solomon, King of Israel, that is due to him being unaware of his heritage and his connections to demons. He was as Solomon in many friendships with varying demons.

When the first demon summoned by William comes to present himself he causes a chain reaction for all the other demons to pursue William. They all pursue William claiming he is Solomon. If he is Solomon then he is the elector chosen by Lucifer the King of Demons in Hell to elect his rightful successor. Even though, William blessed by God he is also favored by his majesty Lucifer. Do not be surprised if you soon discover angels and demons fighting for control over William.

The anime series has one of the better anime endings and gives the impression the series could have a Season 2. The characters are pretty fun and diverse in personality. William is a favorite where he is such a realist and hilarious in his over-the-top reactions. All the other characters are a source of headaches to him like Dantalion and Sytry.

Takuya Eguchi voices William Twining who is the same voice actor who voices Hikigaya Hachiman who was the main character of Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru. (My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected.)

Takuya Eguchi is a favorite voice actor of mine. His voice is quite distinct since he has such a powerful voice. He also sings along with some of the other voice actors the Opening and Closing Theme Song of Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist. Both of these songs are pretty amazing and are very cool since he sings in duets with the about three other voice actors and adds a pounding guitar beat. For him to be a voice actor and a pretty good singer really shows hes very talented.

Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist is one of the most magnificent anime seen. The animation was beautiful, characters fun, voice acting high quality, and the overall story intriguing from start to finish.
