8299593,5,B001EUNIOA,"Now I have all 100 TV shows in my collection. This set has 64 of the TV shows the others I got from Amazon by way of the Roy and Dale Volumes. I also have all the Roy Rogers movies which I first began to see as a boy of seven years. Now that I am much older and in this messed up world I now live in it feels good to set back and watch these movies which come from a simpler time when the world was a better place. These movies are a great way to leave this mixed up world of today and spend a little time in bygone days when life was simple, a great way to just relax if only for a few hours. Amazon has all the Roy Rogers movies. When I first started seeing them there had been many I had not seen because they were made before my time, but it was great to reach back and get the ones I had missed and there wasn't a bad one in the lot.",1462406400,4,838,3.661111111111111

8299595,5,B001EUNIOA,"I bought these for my sons a year ago.  They absolutely LOVE it!  Good, clean movies with good moral character being taught throughout.  Every time we get pizza, we HAVE to watch a Roy movie.  In a year though, we've still probably never watched them all!  Highly, Highly recommended if you like cowboy movies!",1293494400,6,310,4.666666666666667
8299596,5,B001EUNIOA,"Every Roy Rogers and Dale Evans fan will love this set.  56 episodes in a two-volume set.

I have this set from the Nostalgia Merchant and love it.  The quality is very good for these old episodes.

Highly recommended for any Roy Rogers Show fan.",1250121600,10,246,4.4
