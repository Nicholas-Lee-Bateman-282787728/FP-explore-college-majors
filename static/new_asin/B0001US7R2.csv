8016632,5,B0001US7R2,"In our Top 10 Movie list of all time and ranking at number 3. One of the funniest and endearing films ever made. These two brothers, A.J. and P.D. are classics and Mitch, who runs the O Bar O ranch [get it O Borrow] is pure classic. This movie is becoming a Cult Classic and demands a viewing. Best ever.",1407456000,,304,4.083333333333333
8016633,5,B0001US7R2,"A personal favorite, set and filmed near my home town. It is a fun story with quirky characters.  A nice take on life in New Mexico.",1325116800,,132,4.076923076923077
8016634,4,B0001US7R2,"First up, I confess I bought this because Dana Delany was in it. The first ten minutes had me thinking that was probably the only plus. I found it hard to understand the words and it seemed to be a shambles. But then it quickly grew on me and I found the characters interesting and funny. The New Mexico setting, the way of life and the terms used (e.g. outfitter and custodian) made it a fascinating comedy. I wanted the brothers to succeed - at anything. Everyone turned out to  have their own good points. Connie Binoculars was lots of fun. Dana played an interesting woman very well. I wish it had gone on longer. Thoroughly recommended.",1264809600,2,641,4.478632478632479
8016635,5,B0001US7R2,"The Outfitters is an independent movie made in Southern New Mexico. The movie is very realistic as far as the characters, geography, story line, etc. Lead actor Del Zamora is originally from the area that the movie was shot in. Del is one of the most watchable actors working in movies today. He is tremendously under-rated. Del was great as the main 'Waas Sappening Boys' in BORN IN EAST LA; the older Rodriguez Brother in REPO MAN; a union cop in ROBOCOP; and as the lead actor in SEARCHERS 2.0. He is also in the most famous HILL STREET BLUES episode ever, as a doomed partner to Detective Buntz (Dennis Franz), in a script written by Dick Wolf; John Leguizamo's cocaine dealing brother in MIAMI VICE; a Columbian coffee house owner who stands up to Det. Sipowitz (Dennis Franz again) in NYPD BLUE; a Kafka teaching teacher in MY SO CALLED LIFE. These are just a few of the numerous credits that Del Zamora has. For a complete list of his credits, look him up on [...]. Del is so hard to spot in his roles. He seems to hide behind the characters and has so many different looks, that it is hard to recognize him at all. That is the sign of a real actor.  The Outfitters is a fun family movie. Del Zamora is the glue that holds it all together. Some one in Hollywood, give this guy a BIG BREAK!",1252800000,,1296,4.333333333333333
8016636,4,B0001US7R2,The filming of this movie was in a small out of the way area of NM.  Some of the references in the dialogue are missed by the average viewer.  This is due to the fact unless you have lived there you don't recognize the humor.,1251590400,,225,3.977777777777778
8016637,5,B0001US7R2,"Brothers P. D. (Danny Nucci) and A. J. (Del Zamora), in an effort to keep possession of their family property, a languishing New Mexico ranch, undertake a series of somewhat quixotic projects to raise money in this delightful film that has vanished into the memory hole, due primarily to its extremely localized (southern New Mexico) flavour and dialects, notwithstanding its enthusiastic reception at Sundance. Director/scriptor Reverge Anselmo's initial effort displays an awareness of the significant and unique Southwestern U. S. quality of light, an essential element within the film's mise en sc&egrave;ne, and effective editing helps in sharply contrasting daylight and night scenes, serving also to heighten new and rediscovered romantic liaisons. Each role is written to foster its further development and the four leads accept the challenge as Nucci, who has a substantial acting range, and Zamora turn in their most interesting performances, while Dana Delaney and Sarah Lassez are also resourceful, with supporting players Ed Bruce and Steve Reevis leaving lasting impressions, all abetted by a leisurely rhythm established by the director, in addition to his talent at polishing details and the decision to eschew undue cutting. The script is distinctly experience based, and the actors' obvious enjoyment of it along with their ability to ad lib accent the proceedings that are generally light-hearted, while yet offering sufficient emotional substance to spawn interest in unusual amorous pairings, and including a strong feeling of brotherly kinship, to boot. An occasional lapse into slapstick mars the production's warmly comedic tone, but that is its sole shortcoming, and a combination of uncommon incident and thoroughgoing character point of view energize a plot that, albeit episodic, never lacks for continuity in a piece that, although specific to a rural setting, offers more hulled insights than can normally be found in the ubiquitous treatments of decaying cities and their mean streets. Remarkably gifted Anselmo had never seen a motion picture camera, spoken with an actor, or in fact read about filmmaking in any of its technical aspects before undertaking to produce and direct this work. His scenario is essentially drawn from his own experiences, is lucidly written, and is filmed squarely where the action is occurring, with an originality seldom seen in American cinema.",1132790400,5,2407,5.490566037735849
