4597581,1,B0057OQNCI,"I AM SUPER ANGRY! WHY IS THIS ONLY HALF THE SEASON ON DVD, YET IT IS ONLY $5 CHEAPER THAT THE FULL SEASON??? I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS UNLESS IT GETS LOWERED!!!!
i love glee but come onnnn!!!!!

Edited september 18:
This review was intended for the original price which was 39.99
How could I not complain about having to spend $40 on only half a season? Now the price is half that so I am happy",1314144000,5,393,4.103896103896104
4597582,4,B0057OQNCI,"For the most part the second half of season 2 is enjoyable and packed with great musical numbers. Storylines from the first half continue such as Kurt at Dalton, Finn/Rachel, and Puck/Lauren. The Dalton Warblers, who were a cool addition at first become overexposed in this half. There are literally random musical numbers with them that have no relevance to the plot (See Bills, Bills, Bills and Animal). Blaine (played by breakout star Darren Criss) gets a larger role but very little character development. I've seen a lot of fans complain about the behavior of some of the characters this season, and while I agree with them on some points, I think that the way Finn or Santana act is exactly how some teenagers act. For instance Finn, who was cheated on by Quinn with Puck in season 1) steals Quinn from Sam. Quinn goes back to being a little like her season 1 self and pursues the prom queen crown aggressively. Finn's behavior in some of these episodes is douchey, but I felt that the reason he did some of the things he did (treating Sam like crap) was because he was still insecure about what happened with Quinn in season 1 and Rachel's small fling with Puck re-opened those wounds. By getting Quinn back he probably felt like he was getting back his pride as immature as that sounds. A story I really enjoyed was the original songs that Rachel was working on. My Headband is probably the funniest moment ever in Glee! Stand out episodes for me were The Sue Sylvester Shuffle, Blame it on the Alcohol, Rumours, Funeral and the season finale New York.",1311379200,7,1560,4.615107913669065
4597583,2,B0057OQNCI,"The CD 1 was fine, CD 2 and 3 appear to be damaged, they ""skip"" and become blurred while playing. I thought it was the TV (which I purchased in April) so I replaced it but the CD's still won't play thru. I know I am beyond the return date but thought you'd want to know.

4597584,5,B0057OQNCI,Back when the show was still great! The original cast was still in high school. Good season easily some of my favorite episodes.,1377820800,,128,4.608695652173913

She has seen all episodes already and will be seeing them again.",1358208000,,117,4.318181818181818
4597586,5,B0057OQNCI,"For a while this DVD was almost the same price as buying the entire season, so I waited to buy it. I got this for $13, thanks!",1354665600,,126,3.7037037037037037
4597587,5,B0057OQNCI,"I absolutely LOVE Glee! I'm a total Gleek! I was so excited when I received this in the mail. I can't stop watching it. I also have the first season and the first half of the second season, so I've been watching them on repeat. It just brightens my day.",1330214400,,253,4.08
4597588,5,B0057OQNCI,Thank you for your careful attention to our order. We were waiting for this DVD and were very happy when it arrived. The DVD was carefully wrapped and arrived in excellent condition. Again thank you very much!!!!,1320796800,,212,4.756756756756757

4597590,5,B0057OQNCI,"Absolutely amazing show. Awesome episodes. Love how realistic the characters are. Its a real testament to the way a lot of teenagers actually feel - like outcasts, underdogs. This will empower them, help them realise its okay to be an underdog, or an outcast.",1318982400,,259,4.909090909090909
4597591,5,B0057OQNCI,"It is a little odd to review a DVD set because if you are buying it, you like it. I love Glee, therefore I love the DVD set.  Thanks!",1318809600,,133,3.586206896551724

4597593,5,B0057OQNCI,My daughter has turned me into a gleek.  It's something we can watch together and discuss since some of the topics are a bit over a level of a 13yr old.,1318204800,,152,3.903225806451613
4597594,5,B0057OQNCI,"Product as described. Great item to addd to DVD collection, especially for GLEEKS!! Awesome music, dancing, and talent...will not disappoint!",1318204800,,141,6.1
4597595,4,B0057OQNCI,"I really enjoyed the first season of glee and the first half of the second season.
The second half did not quite live up to my expectations. I am hoping the 3rd season will be better.",1318204800,,183,4.111111111111111
4597596,5,B0057OQNCI,"The GLEE season DVD is as delightful as watching the show originally.  What a super team these talented people are, and that includes all those behind the scenes are well!",1318032000,,171,4.7
4597597,5,B0057OQNCI,Eager to begin the third season and is published in soon on DVD. A series of fun and deserves the success it is receiving.,1316995200,,122,4.125
4597598,3,B0057OQNCI,"What happened to ""Glee""? The first DVD ""The Road to Sectionals"" was fresh, fun, addictive television that possessed a well-written, naturally-paced, brilliantly executed story arc topped off with Lea Michele's sizzling rendition of ""Don't Rain On My Parade"". The second DVD release containing the last-half of Season One paled a little in comparison but was still great TV.

Only into its sophomore season and it appears ""Glee"" is already falling apart and here's why:

- It seems the writers are trying to keep the episodes more self-contained (to play better in future syndication) and there aren't many good story arcs.
- Good characters/actors like Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Burt Hummell (Mike O'Malley) are wasted or don't get enough screen time.
- Kurt's ladyvoice performing those over-the-top numbers is beyond annoying.
- The Warblers are a terrible addition and their ""leader"" Blaine (Darren Criss) is the worst case of a dork being promoted as a heartthrob since Henry Winkler was playing Fonzie on ""Happy Days"". I keep hoping they'll get their own spin-off just to get them off the show.
- Characters like April (Kristen Chenowith) and Holly (Gwyneth Paltrow) keep making returning engagements when they weren't that great to begin with.

By the time we get to the episode ""Born This Way"", things start to improve but it's a case of too-little-too-late. The Prom show is definitely the high point of this set (it made Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" actually tolerable) but you have to wade through a lot to get there.

I loved ""Glee"" in the beginning but the producers and writers have ruined it with too many unlikeable characters, and if they don't do some damage control and rebound in Season Three, it will become almost unwatchable.

Three Stars.",1316217600,3,1766,5.054982817869416
4597599,5,B0057OQNCI,"Everyone needs to chill out about this being only half the season and so expensive. Anyone who remembers the DVD release schedule for Season 1 should have already been aware that the DVDs for S2 were coming in separate volumes and then a big final all-inclusive set. No one forced you to buy Season 2 Volume 1. Those who wanted to save a few dollars should have just had a bit of patience and waited for the full season release they knew was coming (there's seriously no difference between the bonus features on this release and on the full season, they're the exact same unless you're getting Blu-Ray).",1315699200,2,603,4.592592592592593
4597600,5,B0057OQNCI,I don't know why everyone is so angry. This DVD is for the biggest gleeks who didn't want to wait for the whole season to come out so they already own Season 2 Volume 1. The same goes for Season 1. I'm counting the days I still have to live without this DVD.,1315094400,5,258,3.8867924528301887
4597601,5,B0057OQNCI,This is the best show ever created. It is so fantastic. I don't think I could live without it. Everyone should watch Glee.,1314403200,3,122,4.3478260869565215
4597602,5,B0057OQNCI,"If you like Glee this is a must!  I found Season 1 vol. 1 at the local disc replay store,  I was disappointed it wasn't the whole season.  And had some trouble finding it~ until I got on Amazon.  I am not sure why they put it season in 2 volumes.  Great program!",1314230400,,262,3.8679245283018866
