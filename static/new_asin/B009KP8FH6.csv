5344967,5,B009KP8FH6,"I bought the book by the same title and decided to start watching these videos that our church has bought. My wife and I have watched episode 1 and 3. These tell as Keesee has put it, videos that show the ""advancement of the Gospel"" around the world's most difficult places. Most of these places are plagued by sin and some of what you will see, like episode 1, will no doubt be depressing and heart breaking. But in the midst of that are believers who are reaching the lost for Christ. They are a wake up call to us here in the West and America that our calling is to share the Good News of Jesus to every person. And you don't need to go that far to do it but the fields are ready for the harvest. Watch them but not as entertainment but as  believer asking  who wants to open his heart to do the work of the Kingdom.",1407456000,4,819,4.049382716049383

5344969,5,B009KP8FH6,"My husband and I were grumpy and at odds with one another recently, upset over multiple little things, but when we sat down to watch an episode of Dispatches our eyes were immediately brought off of ourselves and onto Christ and how He is building His church.
These DVD's are written with incredibly God-exalting perspective; the missionaries are not worshiped, the suffering are not pitied; God is worshiped and sought after for help!
I cannot recommend these DVD's enough. Some of them might be a little troubling for younger children, so parents might want to watch them first. Some episodes are more encouraging than others (2 was my favorite!) but they are all wonderful.",1393372800,10,676,4.93859649122807
5344970,5,B009KP8FH6,This series contains great insight into the various missions fields around the world. We should use our talents more in the area of media to make better Christian media that will further His Kingdom... This series is great to have and each church should get a copy and share with their members so that we may better partner Him in His mission.,1366502400,3,343,4.548387096774194
5344971,4,B009KP8FH6,These are a wonderful alternative to most of what there is to watch today. The pace took a while to get used to but even that was a nice break. It was also encouraging to see the work The Lord is doing around the world. With the direction that American culture is taking it can be easy to get discouraged. The stories remind us that The Lord is building his kingdom form every tribe and nation.,1361404800,5,394,4.197368421052632
5344972,5,B009KP8FH6,"Tim Keesee presents a challenging yet triumphant survey of the work of Christ and the gospel on the front lines of missions work. Each video last about an hour, but you won't notice the time passing as you are drawn in by the engaging dialogue and gifted camera work. I've watched them twice, and I'm sure those won't be the last viewings.",1360281600,5,339,4.483870967741935

8542591,5,B009KP8FH6,"This film series is one of the best I've seen.  Expect God to work in your heart concerning the area of missions, as well as your relationship with Him.  You won't regret it, and the price is extremely reasonable for what you get.",1483833600,,230,4.325581395348837

8542598,5,B009KP8FH6,"I highly recommend both the DVD set and the book.  If you are even remotely interested in Christian missions and the growth of God's kingdom in some of the most hostile areas of the world, you will find this book to be a great encouragement.  I found this book to be a beacon of hope in a world that seems to be overwhelmed with tragic and terrible events by showing how the church of Jesus Christ is bringing hope and healing to individuals and improving the lives and communities in those very areas that seem to be the worst.  The videos are of excellent quality and in addition to bringing visual clarity to many of the stories in the book, they also include special features such as interviews and commentary that i also found to be encouraging and inspirational.",1414022400,,768,4.510791366906475
