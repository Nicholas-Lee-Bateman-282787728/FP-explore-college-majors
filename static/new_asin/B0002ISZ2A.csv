8600293,5,B0002ISZ2A,"Hi there, my name is David Cleverly and I am the production manager at Central Coast Videoworks in Australia, Art Education division.
We have been producing titles dealing with art since 1987 and when we decided to produce a series on Folk and Decorative Art, we recommended to Australia's Lyn Foster to ask if she would like to teach and present in them as she was just so well-known and appropriate for the job. Fortunately for all of us, Lyn happily agreed and we feel that this is why the videos are, we believe, so good. Lyn has an amzing talent and a wonderful happy personality that shines through in each video. This puts the viewer immediately at ease and ""in the mood for learning"".
This particular video is one of four in the series and concentrates on painting florals on four different ""home-friendly"" pieces: A hair-dryer holder, a soap-dispenser holder, a tissue box holder and a beautiful oval mirror.
The techniques learned from Video 1 ""Back to the Beginning"" are put into further practice here with this title.
Lyn Foster is known the world over for her Folk Art skills and with these videos it is now possible to take advantage of Lyn's knowledge and see for yourself how easy it is to learn this wonderful craft.
