2921535,5,B000BY54IS,"I watched Stories of Valor some time before visiting Gettysburg and just after.  This is an excellent and succinct documentary that utilizes traditional storytelling to convey the grandeur and intensity of the most famous battle to take place on American soil.  I would recommend viewing this just before a visit to the Gettysburg National Military Park so you can be oriented and familiar with the landmarks, monuments, and other key attractions.  Gettysburg is a ""must visit"" place for the American History buff and children with an interest in history.",1192752000,9,555,5.213483146067416

8213108,5,B000BY54IS,"The American Civil War is my favorite part of the history of our country.  This particular show is excellent.  First of all, it gives an accurate portrayal of Gettysburg.  What I particularly enjoy is that this show highlights the deeds of the ordinary soldier.  There are stories about the little things that made up the Gettysburg Battle.  There are human stories not just the retelling of battlefield strategies.  Highly recommended.",1431043200,,436,5.1571428571428575
8213109,5,B000BY54IS,As a history teacher I appreciated the accurate facts and portrayals of events. I will absolutely show this to my class so they can get a deep understanding of the Civil War. Thanks!,1429488000,,182,4.545454545454546

8213111,4,B000BY54IS,"While the content was excellent, my personal opinion is that the narration was a little flat.",1426377600,,93,4.875
8213112,3,B000BY54IS,"Public Television can be a little bias some times. Some of the comments wre not necessary. In whole, however, the film was worth watching.",1417910400,,138,4.791666666666667
8213113,1,B000BY54IS,"This may be one of the most boring documentaries that I have ever watched. As a person who is very much a fan of American History (History Major, specifically the Civil War), this documentary leaves much to be desired.",1414454400,,218,4.615384615384615
8213114,5,B000BY54IS,"National Geographic does it with great vigor for authenticity, giving this Battle the hallowed feel it deserves.  Even after all of the intervening 150 years, understanding the devastation and murderous level of artillery and rifle/pistol fire cannot possibly be conveyed to generations so far removed from the sounds, sights, and fury of those separate yet combined engagements that comprised the entire field of Battle over that momentous three days.  The reverence given the sacrifice of those men who died by those filming and documenting this piece is highly evident.  Pandemonium, chaos, valor, and hopelessness of some actions are given a clear expression in this piece, than any I have seen before!",1397606400,,706,5.342342342342342
8213115,4,B000BY54IS,"This is a very good attempt to tell the stories of the lives of some 53,000 casualties. As such, it is worth the time to watch, and Carradine's narration is delivered well. Some minor inaccuracies but they are only important to true buffs of the battle.",1365811200,,253,4.521739130434782
