8155575,1,B000EGDBZG,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOX SET!!!  I am appalled that Amazon would sell such a poor quality DVD! The paintings depicted are not only details, not the complete painting, but have a washed out, untrue color and are their shapes are also distorted! Moreover, these horrific reproductions are paraded with no chronological or artistic order, rhyme or reason. Even the photographs of the artists are shoddy.  POOR QUALITY and unprofessional. A waste of my money.",1467763200,,450,4.986666666666666
