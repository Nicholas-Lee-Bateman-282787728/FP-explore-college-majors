8292436,5,B001DAVTHO,"My daughter has been an Abby-fan since the first release of this movie. She loves the songs, the animals and the sweet, simple narrated stories that have wholesome lessons about love, kindness, and friendship.

We were lucky enough to attend the World Premiere in Sandy OR and my daughter had already watched it enough times to memorize it at that point!

If you are looking for a cute, entertaining and relatable story with good values and adorable animals acting naturally in a real outdoor setting..look no further. With original music that will keep your child singing long after the show is over, The Tails of Abbygail will warm your heart and make you smile. Your child will be watching it again and again!",1371600000,,712,4.780487804878049
8292437,5,B001DAVTHO,"I have bought the whole series for my grand-daughter and she loves them!!! She is now sitting her baby sister down to watch with her. one of my favorite things are the songs... especially ""It's a Tough Life"" with Shorty Pants. What a breath of fresh air ""The Tails of Abbygail"" brings to our children and grandchildren to counter balance the anger and violence in most movies. You cant help but smile at these movies. Thank you Tails of Abbygail!!!",1371600000,3,448,4.6125
