7907622,5,B00000F988,"A Pulitzer was just won by Eugene O'Neill for his play of the same name.  The first film adaptation, a year later was Blanche Sweet, directed by John Griffith Wry and produced by Thomas H. Ince.  It was faithful, right down to the intertitles.  It is uncanny that Garbo's versions would, in some instances, be scene by scene ""copies"" of Miss Sweet's performance.  But alas, this was also in the stage directions of the play itself.  Very rarely has film wandered from the text of the actual play or changed the setting(s) of the play.  Blanche is superb.  Her artistry is evident as is her silent film technique, a la, under the tutelage of the Master D.W. Griffith.  Some scenes, you could actually see Lillian Gish.  Both Gish and Blanche were friends and rivals during their Hollywood reign with Griffith.  This VHS is a must for collectors.  It is now on a rare edition DVD offered by Brian Pinette.  You can find it here and there on the internet.  Either version, buy it! See it.",1229299200,,985,4.56
7907623,4,B00000F988,"This is a very good silent film with excellent acting in the three main roles (Anna Christie, her alcoholic father and her lover)making this bitter-sweet melodrama compulsive viewing. Unlike most silent films however, this VHS has no music and no sound whatsoever, which might be disappointing to some.  I personally didn't mind the absence of music and got used to it after a few minutes, but a good quality film like this would certainly be enhanced with a suitable musical score.  There are some dramatic peaks and different moods throughout the film which could be accentuated with the right music, but the acting and unfolding of the story are good enough to make an impact without the assistance of music.

""Anna Christie"" depicts the sad story of a child abandoned by her alcoholic father and raised by abusive relatives which leads to life as a prostitute, but when she is reunited with her father 15 years later, both are motivated to improve their lives for the other's sake.  There is quite a bit of emotion and depth at times, leaving you with the satisfied feeling of having gained something from the story and its fine acting.  I think this film is worth having in a good silent film collection despite the lack of music, and let's hope it will be available on DVD with good music before too long!",1095811200,,1311,4.707423580786026
7907624,4,B00000F988,"Not to be confused with the 1930 talking version of Eugene O'Neill's play starring Greta Garbo, this is the 1923 silent film version starring Blanche Sweet, who had been the heroine in many of D. W. Griffith's early short films.  ""Anna Christie"" is arguably her finest dramatic performance as she plays the past-haunted Swedish-American prostitute who comes to terms with her unsuspecting, seafaring father (George F. Marion, who had played the role on Broadway).  Meanwhile, Anna finds redemption in the love of Matt Burke (William Russell), a rough-hewn Irish stoker.  A lot of the credit for this film goes to producer Thomas H. Ince, who had something of a reputation for making high quality films, and director John Griffith Wray, who made the grim drama work when translated to the screen.  Bradley King did the screenplay and follow's O'Neill's lead relying on two settings for the story: a New York waterfront saloon and an area of a coal barge.  O'Neill apparently preferred this version to that done by Garbo, and even sent a complimentary telegram to Sweet regarding her fine performance.  Sweet made over a hundred movies and has fared better than most silent film stars in terms of having her work, such as this film and ""Judith of Bethulia,"" prserved and still readily available on video tape.  More importantly, this film captures her very best performance.",1008979200,,1372,5.0176211453744495
