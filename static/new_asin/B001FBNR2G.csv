8301890,4,B001FBNR2G,"Dear J is a Moon Brothers film inspired by the C.S. Lewis Trilemma. The movie tells the story of an evangelist who struggles to cope with the unexpected death of a girl that he both was dating and courageously trying to share God's truth. God unsuspectedly uses all of those around J to help him realize God's key to his own healing... Suspenseful, quirky, and enjoyable - for mature audiences. Enjoy~",1353542400,2,401,4.661971830985915
