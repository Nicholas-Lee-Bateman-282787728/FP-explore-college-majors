7316176,5,B010R6KBEG,Finally!!!  Centurions Part One is here.  This 30 episode set is just like the GOBOTS sets.  3 DVDs with 10 episodes on each DVD.  I'm not a fan of the packaging by having disc 2 on top of disc 3.  So to get disc 3 out you first have to remove disc 2.  The episodes have been remastered and look great on HDTVs.  The colors are vibrant as if the cartoon was produced today.  They did an excellent job on that.  Some will not like the makeover but I'm okay with it.  This set contains episodes 6 to 35 since the first 5 episodes have their own set.  You can obtain that set on Amazon as well.  Once again they do not contain the educational sections at the end of each cartoon.  I don't understand why they would not add them.  I was really hoping they would add those because I really learned a few things from watching them in the 80's.  All in all it's a good set though.  Fun for all ages and your children will love it.  Lots of action to go around.  My burned DVDs can now go in the garbage.  Or maybe not since my burned copies have the educational parts intact.  Do Galtar and the Golden Lance next.  Also finish Mister T please.,1437782400,11,1136,4.095890410958904

7316185,5,B010R6KBEG,"Never thought we get this DVD set! Actually never thought we get the mini-series but here we are. Great news, the first five episodes of the series, which is the mini-series, and already on DVD, is NOT included in this set! Here is the episode list:

27. Hacker Must Be Destroyed
28. Showdown at Skystalk
29. The Warrior
30. Return of Cassandra

If you are an astute Centurions fan you would have noticed immediately that Battle Beneath the Ice is missing from this list but it appears that the episode listing is for chronological viewing pleasure and not the original running order! Some may protest this decision but I think its a nice touch.
The set itself is standard fare with 3 discs in a normal DVD case (solid case, no eco stuff). The DVDs are DVRs and have disc labels which list out the episodes on each disc. The menu screens are in a widescreen aspect ratio which means they properly fill up the screen on my 46 tv. No animations or sounds present on the menu screen. Each episode is in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.
The episodes appear to be remastered like the mini-series was remastered. What is not remastered are the end credits. The end credits look like they were pulled from a VHS tape. Im not sure about the intro but Im re-watching the mini-series now and the coloring on the standard intro looks brighter on the mini-series than on the Part 1 DVDs. Again, Im not sure about this so if someone wants to chime in please do so.
What is missing? I don't see any commercial bumpers on any episode on Part 1 DVDs. Also missing are the science lessons at the end of each episode. I really hate that the series is missing the science lessons and commercial bumpers but this is an MOD and a fairly obscure title for most folks. Honestly Im surprised to see the episodes remastered (but I guess I am assuming that they are remastered and maybe theyve looked this good all along). Part of me wants to give the set four stars because its technically not complete but at the same time I think were getting more than we could ever hope for here. The episodes look great and thats what counts and thats why I give it five stars.
I hope to provide an update soon once I get through the 30 episodes to let readers know if I came across any video/technical issues.

[A final note, since the episodes are missing the science lessons this lends me to believe that we have syndication prints circa the mid-90s. Im not educated enough to know if original footage is missing or not but since the lessons are missing Im betting these episodes are the ones found in syndication and not originally aired episodes.]

[9/26/15 Update - finished all 30 episodes on Part 1 and I'm happy to report no technical issues with the DVDs! I just can't get over the picture quality. Whomever remastered did an amazing job. Underrated show in my opinion.]",1438041600,22,3382,4.522875816993464
7316186,4,B010R6KBEG,"For anyone like me who has been awaiting a release of the Centurions - this is a good dvd set. There are no audio errors, the animation is clean, and it's superior to any boot legs or syndicated showings of the series. It's an excellent buy if you loved the Centurions like I did. Fair warning - and the reason the product only received 4 stars - they've removed Crystal Kane's science lessons from the end of the episodes. So while the episodes are great, it isn't a complete representation of the show we watched as kids.",1437782400,4,523,4.402061855670103
8723009,4,B010R6KBEG,Excellent quality.  Only thing missing is the old PSA at the end like when the show aired.,1489968000,,90,4.294117647058823

8723014,5,B010R6KBEG,"It has been years since I seen this series, a real blast of my childhood. It was awesome the they finally release this series on DVD. For me this one is a classic I really enjoy. The delivery was fast and the disk arrive in good condition. For those who are interested on series by Hanna Barbera I highly recommend this one",1461369600,,323,4.225806451612903
8723015,5,B010R6KBEG,"Centurions has so many unique, intriguing stories to tell each episode, that I never know what to expect. As we progress through the series, we learn more about these heroes and their constant battle against the evil, half machine Doc Terror. The animation is magnificent for such a long running series, with a lot of action, power suit power ups, flying, dodging projectiles and covering a lot of unique locations and landscapes. Frank Welker lends his voice, and there are some voices that sound familiar as if voiced for GI Joe also. The female in the space station with the red hair to one side is beautiful and an integral part to the Centurions success as she watches over them protectively. 632 minutes on 3 discs. Awesome!!",1461196800,2,731,4.7637795275590555
