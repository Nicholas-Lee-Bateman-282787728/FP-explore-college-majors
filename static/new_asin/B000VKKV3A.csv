This product is a wonderful gift for any Care Bear fan and 80's child.  Watching the episodes brought me back to my childhood.  I can share them with my niece and she loves them.  It was a joy to watch her light up and giggle while watching ""Tugs"" and ""Hugs"" and listening to the music.

8219168,5,B000VKKV3A,"Love the ""old school"" care bears so much, so I had to order the 25th Anniversary Edition :) If you love Care Bears, and or your children do too, I would definitely purchase this!!",1427155200,,179,4.294117647058823

8219170,5,B000VKKV3A,"The description clearly says"" care bear set "" anyone saying "" it doesn't come with the bear "" obviously did not read the description and I am mad at them because care bears are awesome!",1398643200,,185,4.314285714285714
8219171,5,B000VKKV3A,"These are the good ol' care bear shows I remember watching as a kid. ""Care bear count down! 4-3-2-1!"" I read on another review somewhere, either for this product or another ""original"" care bears disk, that Care Bears were produced by a couple of different companies in just a few years time span. This one has 2 disks copyright 1986, and two from 1988. I'm not sure if there are some that are older or not, but there might be. The oldest episodes on these disks start with ""Care Bear Family"" episodes, and I seem to remember way back in the cobwebs some care bear shows that were just ""The Care Bears,"" that didn't have the Care Bear Cousins in them. But these start with episodes including the cousins.

Overall, these are really good classics, and they give a good variety from ""the good ol' days"". My preschool age daughters love watching them, and I really enjoy watching these with them, too. Definitely a good buy.",1372377600,2,920,4.542168674698795
8219172,5,B000VKKV3A,"So, it's a trip down memory lane in the style mentioned in Collective Soul's Run. Here are some things that you should know if you're new to Care Bears.

1.) I wanted the DVDs, regardless if it came with a plush bear or not. I got the DVDs, no bear, but the bear would have been a bonus.
2.) It came with 25 episodes on 4 discs, each episode varying from 11 to 22 minutes.
3.) The series in question is the classic 1986-1988 series created by Nelvana
4.) My favorite Care Bear (who also plays a major role in the latest series), Share Bear was still a minor character in this series, but I didn't care, I got to see her original belly badge.
5.) I try NOT to play favorites because I like them all equally, even when my father does parodies of the Care Bears.
6.) The Care Bear Cousins, non-bear animals with similar functions as a regular Care Bear appear in this series.
7.) Three characters exclusive to this series are Hugs Bear, Tugs Bear and Grams Bear.
8.) I wasn't scared by No Heart in the vein that he gave me nightmares as a child, but he did rile me up. I would cheer as the Care Bears foiled his plots and plans.

Well, if you want your child to see truth and justice prevail along with some learning lessons, buy this boxset. If you do get a plush bear, it's a bonus!",1304899200,,1281,4.161290322580645

8219174,5,B000VKKV3A,"This DVD has become an instant favorite with my two preschool-age girls. They watch carebears all day long, and now at least we have enough variety that I don't go insane! I would recomend this product to anyone who is interested in the original CareBears cartoon.

It comes with 4 DVDs. 1. ""Magical Adventure"" has 8 episodes, 2. ""Festival of Fun"" has 7 episodes, 3. ""Kingdom of Caring"" has 6 episodes, 4. ""Adventures in Care-a-lot"" has 4 episodes.

The episodes run about 25 minutes each.

8219175,5,B000VKKV3A,"I saw a lot of reviews that got me a little scared to buy this but i gotta say i got the teddybear with the set and shipping was fast. i would recommend, I had no problems thus far.

Thanks would buy again.",1229472000,3,206,3.7906976744186047
8219176,1,B000VKKV3A,"I ordered this item for my 3 yr old and when it arrived....there was NO Bear, only the DVD set!! HUH?? The image provided for this item is very deceptive, as is the item description. No where in the description does it state that the Bear is not included. The DVD set alone isn't worth the price listed. I would caution anyone else from purchasing this item unless you are only interested in the DVD set. This house has gone from Cheer Bear to Suprised Bear to Grumpy Bear.",1213660800,2,473,4.325842696629214
8219177,1,B000VKKV3A,"I read the reviews before purchase and saw the one where the person had not received the bear. I re-read the description, double-checked other retailers all over the net and figured, if they all sell with the bear, and amazon PICTURES the bear, than it must have been a fluke. But I ordered and received DVDs with no bear. The DVDs alone are certainly not worth the price as they can be purchased cheaper alone, plus the whole reason we ordered was to get the bear. I am waiting for response from amazon, but if there is no bear, I will return the dvds and go to ebay.",1213228800,3,568,4.268518518518518
