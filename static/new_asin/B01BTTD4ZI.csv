Amazon knows what kind of windshield wipers I need and tells me if I'm about to buy the wrong one, this was at the top of the list for which one I should buy.  When I try and play it it tells me the colors don't match, my buddy told me that this specific set only plays of European players.",1511222400,,341,3.857142857142857

8751476,5,B01BTTD4ZI,"It is so much better to watch this on DVD with no commercials.  It isn't Breaking Bad redux, but it is certainly entertaining and the acting is excellent and the story line is up to the Breaking Bad standard.  Lots of fun to watch and I look forward to season three! .  Highly recommended.",1498953600,,289,4.314814814814815
8751477,5,B01BTTD4ZI,My husband was ecstatic to receive his Better Call Saul 1 & 2. He is very happy with these dvd's.,1498521600,,97,3.9
8751478,5,B01BTTD4ZI,"Better Call Saul is a television series spin off from Breaking Bad. Both series were created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould.  In this second season, there are 10 episodes, one better than the next.

Better Call Saul is a prequel. What we have is a lawyer named McGill who lturns into Saul Goodman. We know the end, we saw it on Breaking Bad. In the beginning he turns into the drinking manager of a Cinnabon. We follow him on his journey. He is a loser and a confident man with no ethics.  James McGill is a man with a fate, heading inexorably toward a Cinnabon. Now, we have the saga of Jimmy McGill, Bob Odenkirks lawyer; and Mike, Jonathan Banks grizzled former cop turned part-time enforcer, turned ticket taker.

What we learn in these episodes is how Jimmy McGill and Mike turn to their haunts and  old tricks. What we wonder, is he Jimmy McGill or is he Goodman? And, wow, Mike is something. And we don't know yet, but we will, how does he come to exist?  Bob Odenkirk is marvelous, Jonathan Banks so much better than we ever thought. And, the supporting cast is as good as he is. The writing is superb, small references to BB exist and are shown.
