2476305,5,B000E0OE4O,"To call PULSE ""boring"" or ""incomprehensible"" is to miss the point entirely. There's a big difference between a film that is slow and confusing, and a film that is surreal and deliberately-paced. This is definately the latter.

Writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa is an art-house filmmaker similar to David Lynch or David Cronenberg; you'll either understand what he's trying to do, or you won't.

PULSE ranks as one of the scariest ghost films of all time, taking the creepy style of Hideo Nakata's RING and amping it up to apocolyptic levels. Every frame is soaked with pure dread and there are images that will haunt you till your dying day. There's a rich, complex story going on here...but Kurosawa doesn't spoon-feed it to you. He demands that you be perceptive enough to read between the lines and figure out what's happening.

If you're looking for cheap jump scares and twist endings, don't bother. But if you're in the mood for a slow-burn cerebral horror movie, it doesn't get any better than PULSE!",1141516800,3,1006,4.905882352941177

Is kind of slow paste..But have little here and there suspense. . But very confusing and hard to keep up and fallow the story because your eyes most the times in the damn ""subtitle"" such as I HATE!!...BUT who ever done the shade and shadow in this movie should get the Oscar...because he done hell of the job.

2476307,2,B000E0OE4O,"like most current ghost and horror movies coming out of japan, in ""pulse"", almost nothing happens and what does is incomprehensible.  some reviewers have raved about this flick being a masterpiece of a metaphor about the fragmentation of interpersonal relationship at least partially caused by the internet.  if so, i missed the boat.  it is all style, no substance, but the style of many of the images:  deserted, burning gray tokyo, the grimy interiors and exteriors of housing, the horticultural workplace of some of the protagonists, the university computer room, the deserted factory, can be compelling, hence the two stars.",1141344000,4,629,5.26
2476308,1,B000E0OE4O,"Well, what can I say.  I am an avid horror fan.  I also love to be scared.  I feel that is what horror is all about, not just blood and guts, but a real scare is my favorite.  I admitt, when I saw The Blair Witch project, and the house appeared out of the blue at the end, it really freaked me out.  When I watched The Grudge for the first time in the theatre, it scared the hell out of me.  Even movies like High Tension I felt was a really scary film, not for the faint at heart.  Pulse was not.  You can read other reviews on the plot so I am not going to bore you with that.  The images for the most part were not scary except one toward the very end.  The movie was hard to understand.  Two different stories run pretty much back and forth, one having nothing to do with the other.  The ending itself was strange and hard to understand.  I love the whole Japanese horror thing (especially The Audition which is a great film by the way), but this movie did nothing for me.  Don't waste your money.  The DVD cover is more scary than the movie.",1140998400,4,1046,4.009708737864078
2476309,1,B000E0OE4O,"This movie was DOA.  If truly it frightens you, then for heaven's sake, stay away from movies like ""The Grudge.""  At 119 minutes, ""Pulse"" is about 118 minutes too long.

2476310,3,B000E0OE4O,"Well, the comment about the subtitles is true, there is a 2 second delay. When I saw it in the theater, the caption was in real time. The captioning is somewhat messed up. An example is when they displayed the title of the movie, the captioning was under the Japanese text and not in the middle of the screen. No doubt it is a great movie, but it seems that scenes were cut from the original. Like the music would just suddenly cut into a new scene. Hmm, strange. And another thing, its listed unrated, but in the back its clearly rated R. Is it just my copy cuz if it is I'm totally POed.",1140652800,3,589,4.130434782608695
2476311,2,B000E0OE4O,The movie is GREAT but I have a real problem with the subtitles. I've been watching subtitled movies for years and this is the first one where the actors speak and i have to wait a second to read the subtitle. Is anyone else noticing this? it doesn't kill the movie but it is definitely annoying.,1140652800,4,296,4.303571428571429
2476312,4,B000E0OE4O,"Many films have attempted the end of days.  Zombie films such as Dawn Of The Dead, 28 Days Later, 12 Monkeys to name a few.  All of them have their own story but never had their own Feel. Get Ready for PULSE.  A J-horror film to it's own completely that will leave you thinking about the film long after a viewing.

To keep this short and without going into ruining the story for you.  This is not like any Asian Horror film you've seen before.  It's not for those looking for a gore fest but, those that like artistic films with a message may enjoy this much.  It's not so easy to understand but in Japanese culture films don't spoon feed the story to the viewer.  This way you get to take away from it what you feel and still (hopefully) understand the story.  It's not so hard and you don't have to look far to see the undertone of this film is that we are all living in a world where we are all seperate.  There is no sense of community and we are living like ghosts.  If you aren't, then you're one of the few who isn't paralized by consumerism and (more importantly) internet.  We've never been so connected yet so separate.

I think it's perfect for anyone planning on comparing the American release or who's in the mood for something deep and atmospheric.  If you're into Teen horror flix or the famous blood soaked asian shock flix this is not for you.  This is unto itself and will pull those viewers with a though process deep inside only to turn you out full of thoughts and urging for a second viewing.

Only dissapointment is the distribution company was so cheap that they FORCE you to watch their previews.  If you try to skip them you can't get into the menu.  Although the previews were interesting they had nothing to do with the film in any relation and this company will not get another purchase from me unless they had something I definately wanted.  The price for the DVD is so high... you should be able to have a working menu if you find the way around those previews.  Making the menu not work if you pass around the previews is only an annoyance and is a total shame on the Production company and the studios.  I hope the stingy hollywood studios don't catch on to the process because I would honestly stop buying DVDs that perform like this.

It is a movie you will enjoy watching over and over, with different people and to see their reactions! It is a little slow as many japanese films are, but it is worth every minute.

2476325,4,B000E0OE4O,"he year was 2001 and internet was still in its infancy stage. High speed wasn't around, and dial-up was your only choice. If that wasn't bad enough, you also had to deal with ghosts travelling through the lines, infecting your computer and making you all moppy, eventually turning you into a black spot on the wall.

Pulse, known as Kairo in Japan, is a supernatural horror film that takes the Ghost in the Machine story we all know and love, and sprinkles in their wacky Japanese flair that weve come to copy and mimic. We have long haired ghosts, who just want to be loved and not alone. Thats the heart of the story of Pulse. We are all alone, we will die alone, and even after we are dead, we will still be alone. Man, this movie is a downer.

REVIEW

Pulse takes a simple story and tries its hardest to make it a completely messed up, confusing mess and boy, does it succeed. I lost count how many times I was wondering what the hell was happening. Characters come and go, people die randomly, and product placement for red construction tape runs rampant. I wish I could tell you what the movie is about, but I just cant comprehend it, and according to several reviews on IMDb, I am not alone.

Now, I know the gist of the story, as I previously mentioned above. Ghosts are spilling over into our world, using the dial-up internet to infect peoples computers. These beings are tricking people into visiting a website that will ask them if they want to see a ghost. If they do see the ghost, they become sad, scared, depressed and believe they will be alone forever. This feeling of being alone creates a depression spiral for people everywhere until eventually, they fade away into a black stain. Why these people fade away, I have no idea.

After most have disappeared, we are left hanging out with Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kat) and Michi Kudo ( Kumiko As), who come together after having spent the majority of the movie in their own separate, albeit utterly confusing storylines. The two hatch a plan to survive, but will they make it out of whatever the heck is going on? Honestly, I have no sweet clue.

Hey, at least the movie is better than the American sequels to the American remake Pulse. Those I couldn't even get through the opening few minutes. Yeesh.

Arrow Video has released Pulse on Blu-ray, using an HD Master that was provided to them. The quality of the transfer isn't going to win awards, but it also isn't the worst transfer Ive seen. The grain is heavy at times and film can be pretty dark and hard to make out whats happening, but its most likely the best the movie has ever looked. The same goes for the audio presentation, with a Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles. Its a bit on the weak side at times, but nothing a bit volume up won't fix.

The real treat for buying this Blu-ray comes in the form of special features. We have numerous interviews, with the Kiyoshi Kurosawa interview stretching into the 40-minute mark. We have also been provided with an archive making of featurette that also runs over 40 minutes long. If you happen to love the movie, the special features are going to be keeping you busy for several hours. The only thing missing is an audio commentary.

VERDICT

I honestly cant tell you if I hated Pulse or just didn't understand it. There are moments of brilliance and genuine scares to be had, but I just cant help but remember the staggering amount of times I was confused. The film hardly explains anything, and when it does try, it comes off as something completely asinine.

But honestly, this is just my useless opinion and who cares about that, right? If you want to know whether you should buy the Blu-ray if you're a fan of the film, you most certainly should as it has all the special features you would want.

Buy with confidence if you're a fan.",1500940800,,3822,4.507225433526012
2476326,4,B000E0OE4O,"Pulse,"" directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, contains two related storylines. The first involves a young woman who works at a plant nursery in a high-rise building. Her investigation of a colleagues suicide leads her to some dark and perilous places. The second plot line follows a computer-illiterate student who teams with a female tech geek whos researching paranormal phenomena on the Internet.

These characters encounter terrifying images on their computer screens and TVs. The images are connected to various disappearances with victims hiding themselves in rooms sealed with red tape, melting into walls, and leaving only an ashen residue.

Director Kurosawa (no relation to Akira Kurosawa) creates tremendous atmosphere without resorting to excessive gore and violence. He builds his horror gradually, getting under the skin as he immerses the characters into a nightmarish world. The film has elements of Poltergeist and the more recent Arrival. The question posed is What is the more horrifying, a massive cataclysmic conflagration to end mankind or the gradual wasting away of humanity? Few horror movies take the time to pose existential questions, more content to take the easier route of visceral gut-wrenching visuals. Kurosawa works hard to achieve a level of terror, and his efforts pay off handsomely.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include premiere footage from the Cannes Film Festival; cast and crew introductions from opening day screenings in Tokyo; making-of documentary; 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes; new interviews with writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa and cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi; trailers and TV spots; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.

2476327,5,B000E0OE4O,"In 'Pulse,' the threat is us... not just the worst among us, but all of us. We are our own worst enemy.

Most of us enjoy perfect freedom today, the likes of which civilization has never seen. We need not depend on a single other living soul, if we prefer not to. Those we must engage, for the sake of our own needs, we can choose to barely connect with, at a distance, and suffer no social or moral cost for that choice. But no man needs nothing, and at what price do we stop needing even ourselves? In 'Pulse,' the monster is the existential anomie that's gripped us for decades: the crushing weight of being solely responsible for our own happiness, and the angst of those bereft of what Victor Frankl called the 'will to meaning.' The devil, or lack thereof, will find work for idle hands to do.

The suicide of young Taguchi puzzles his friends. As they skulk about their menial jobs and their tiny, dingy Tokyo apartments trying to make sense of his death, Michi notices that Yabe is taking it particularly hard. She begins to fear Taguchi's suicide may be contagious for Yabe.

She doesn't know the half of it. Yabe has seen an apparition of their friend, and an ashy stain the size and shape of a man, in the same spot where Taguchi took his life. Meanwhile, in her own neighborhood, Michi watches a neighbor seal the front door of her apartment with red duct tape. The neighbor, too, later commits suicide... could her death and Taguchi's somehow be related?

Meanwhile Kawashimi, an aimless but affable young man with a quirky penchant for Hawaiian shirts and trivial American t-shirt slogans, logs onto the internet for the first time. He immediately finds himself in some sort of spooky CUSeeMe gallery: other youths inside their own studio apartments, barely moving, always alone, facing their webcams but apparently trapped in some wordless, voiceless stasis.

The ghastly site jolts Kawashimi, but doesn't necessarily get under his skin. The guy seems happy-go-lucky and a bit dim, not one to expend too many calories contemplating the meaning of our existence. He's more curious about whether a website can really pick you to surf to, instead of vice versa. He enlists the help of a pretty young teaching assistant, Harue, to start tugging at the loose threads of the mystery. ""What made you visit the internet? You don't like computers, right?"" she wonders. ""Everybody else is into it,"" he shrugs, to which Harue rejoins, resigned, ""People don't really connect, you know."" There's an undercurrent in 2001's 'Pulse,' pre-smartphone, that technology is only isolating society further, not bringing us together: ""I suggest you don't stare at it for too long.""

These two stories will intersect, and a modern world that was already lonely when it was full of strangers will become still emptier and lonelier, even after some of these characters find each other. This is where 'Pulse' really hits its stride. It's the logical endgame of a long tradition of postwar cinema, in which nihilism has for decades threatened to engulf the heroes; in 'Pulse,' all of civilization is at stake.

The Enlightenment of the 1700s saw solitude turn into a secular virtue, rather than a religious one... Rousseau walking alone in nature, contemplating man's inhumanity to man. But, like present-day blanket critics of the historical church, Rousseauism could not foresee that man's exploitation of each other also had advantages to society... namely, the interdependence of society itself. A new phenomenon emerged from the Industrial Revolution: the self-sustaining loner. There's a direct lineage to the hikikomori and 'herbivores' of today's Japan, and the malaise is certainly not confined to the young. When Michi worries aloud about Yabe to her boss, who's old enough to be her father, he muses, ""The best of intentions always wind up hurting your friends deeply. And then you wind up getting hurt. Is friendship always that way? If so, what's left?"" If every need and want is within the reach of even modest means, what use is friendship? Why risk making friends or staying loyal to family, if none of us truly need each other?

I worry that I'm overstating (and over-quoting) 'Pulse's' more philosophical ideas, and suggesting that it's a clunky wordfest. Less-impressed viewers may protest I'm bringing more subtext to 'Pulse' than the film itself aspired to. To both I say: just see it, or see it again. This ghost story (no blood or guts, no jump scares) is visual, with a subtle, strange poetry I'm not even beginning to do justice to here. The allegory is implied, never overstated, even in moments of obviously sub-textual dialog such as I've quoted here. Its filmic rhythms are reminiscent of 'The Shining,' but are far less self-conscious. Pulse is the closest you'll get while watching a movie to the feeling of a nightmare you want to wake up from, but can't: frozen, unable to run. It's one of those very rare horror films where the monster actually gets scarier the more it's revealed.

I underestimated this movie at first. I enjoyed its creepiness and ingenuity on first viewing, and didn't think much else of it at the time. Over the ensuing weeks, months and years 'Pulse' gnawed at me. Remembering it evoked pleasant shivers over its lyrical surrealism, and mounting dread as I thought through its core premise: that when it's this easy and convenient to fulfill our basic needs, we risk starving ourselves of finding any greater purpose in life within those meager responsibilities, which threatens to turn us all into ghosts. This must be a particularly potent fright if you've grown up in Tokyo with the Japanese work ethic and the ensuing hikikomori phenomenon, but it's an existential terror that modernity has been fostering globally for over a century now. Fear of the unexamined life... among the most prevalent and persistent philosophies of developed society since Plato... has steeply intensified post-religion, and is arguably neck-and-neck now with Rousseauism in a bid to become our dominant worldview. Existentialism, and then nihilism, threaten to eclipse Rousseauism in the Information Age as AI, machine learning and other virtual automation make all our lives still more leisurely, but most of those lives less purposeful. It's an ingenious idea to make a creepshow out of the will to meaninglessness, and in 'Pulse,' that theme transcends horror and enters the realm of tragedy.

'Pulse' is certainly among the finest J-Horrors ever made... easily the equal of 'Ringu,' and probably superior, if less out-and-out entertaining. It's one of the deepest horror films since 'The Exorcist,' which exploited our fear of a world where God doesn't matter; 'Pulse' makes us fear a world where none of us will matter to ourselves. But it resonates beyond horror... perhaps far beyond. Only time will tell, but this may prove to be one of the key films of the new century. Perhaps it will only remain a cult favorite; perhaps I'm bringing more thematic weight to it as a viewer than is actually there. In any event, I hope Arrow's 2017 reissue will bring it a larger audience, and perhaps contribute to raising its critical esteem over time.",1499558400,4,7172,4.9493355481727574
2476328,5,B000E0OE4O,"I own the Japanese print of the DVD of this movie, which I regard as a masterpiece.  I understand that the slow pace and unusual atmosphere of this movie may lull some viewers to sleep, but for me those are the very strengths of the film.  The American remake of the film is adequate but is mere entertainment, not art, and does not capture at all the sense of dread and helplessness which makes the Japanese original so unforgettable.  I am anxiously looking forward to the Bluray release coming soon.  The film requires careful attention to gray tones and shadows, and I hope the engineers do justice to this important work.",1499126400,4,626,4.612612612612613

As a horror fan, however, I saw in Pulse the seeds of future films like the Ring, Matrix, It Follows and other great horror and sci-fi films for grown-ups.

Watching this film don't expect to be scared as much as stimulated by an amazing inquiry into what it means to be human and to live for, and among, others.

It takes a master filmmaker to create a world of unease with just the pixelated image of a man sitting in an office chair. If you think that there aren't any more scary movies to discover and you're desensitized to being frightened by a movie, give Pulse a try and see if that changes your mind.",1486512000,5,595,4.570093457943925

Then after I saw a couple of movies that were apocalyptic in nature, I  started thinking  about Pulse, but couldn't remember the title.  I think the subject of an  unknown invading our space,  without our being able to combat it, is a great plot.

2476337,5,B000E0OE4O,"This movie is masterful.  The first time I watched it, I barely paid attention because I was multitasking.  With it having subtitles and not understanding what was being said along with looking away from the tv periodically it seemed somewhat bland just from the visuals but then the first scary scene happened.  The pacing, soundtrack and general ambience of it was very unsettling.  It was like I was experiencing someone's nightmare.  After that scene I paid more attention but kept multitasking and then another scene that generated the same feeling. I watched the film again and paid more attention and it got better.  Within 2 days I watched it 3 times.  I never do that with films.

It's not an in your face type scary, no shock value.  It's foreboding, empty, lonely.  It's that feeling when you walk into an empty house you don't want to be in and you have to stay.  It's the waiting, wondering of what could happen.  Time dwindles away slowly and your imagination is left to it's own devices.  The ghosts in this film are very unnerving and I won't go into detail why.  I've never seen a film that had this kind of eerie ambience.  Sometimes it makes sense and others I'm left wondering ""what was that part all about"".  It's a film that should be watched several times to fully grasp.  You are not told what to think.  You are given opinions by the characters.  Their individual experiences of the surreal which it only gives it more of a dream like quality.

I realize that a lot of academic criticism has been directed at this film but frankly I found it terribly dull, wandering, and badly edited and acted. After Ringu, which was a stellar film that dealt much more cleverly with media and horror, this one didn't come close to scaring me, and the long sections in which the ghosts are ""explained"" to us was a snore.  I suppose the statement it makes about depression and social isolation in Japan is something worth examining, but the aleatory nature of the plot (which I know is not a ""western"" device) left me feeling that it could have been better edited. The subtitles were stilted and over-used. How many times do you think we need the word ""help"" translated for us when the ghost repeats it six or seven times in a row? There are a number of great films out there that deal with uses of media as social commentary about communication, but this one is low on the list, and derivative to boot.",1385856000,,1161,4.476415094339623
2476378,5,B000E0OE4O,"I can tell that quite a few - but thankfully not all - the reviewers just don't ""get"" Japanese horror movies.  The best ones, like Pulse (Kairo), create and sustain a mood, adding to it like the many layers on a lacquer box, have metaphysical and/or philosophical implications, and end without resolving anything.  On the other hand, many Americans seem to prefer horror movies with:  loud noises, screaming, murders with sharp instruments, lots of CGI, endings that explain and resolve everything, and above all, absolutely no thinking required, thank you.  Let me be perfectly clear:  If they are well-done, I like those American horror movies too.  However, I am not an unreflective, totally passive consumer who takes his self, time and society as simply given and therefore not to be questioned or even criticized.  Thankfully, I'm not the only one, as evidenced by the reviewers who ""got"" Pulse.

I just have to say that the one reviewer who didn't ""get"" Pulse and explained that it didn't do anything for him because the computer technology in the film was ""dated"", and so had lost it's ""entertainment"" value, totally missed what the movie was really all about!

Pulse is about personal alienation from self and others and the loss of meaning in modern society. Today almost everyone has a cell phone, a computer, television, etc., and many have ipads or tablets too.  But is that making us better at communicating and understanding ourselves and making real contact with each other, or has it also introduced new barriers to real intimacy and knowledge about who we really are as individuals and as humans?  That's the real unanswered question in Pulse.

In Pulse, even death is an unending total drag, because it is filled with the spirits of untold millions of isolated, alienated beings who can never really connect with each other.  The dead know nothing, they understand nothing - and they are eternally lonely.  And who are these ghosts, other than us?  Isn't that incredibly terrifying?  No wonder their impact on the living is so devastating.  Who am I really? Am I my job, my career, my social status, my latest and greatest possessions and gadgets?  What does it really mean to be human? Why is real human communication so difficult?  Why am I working so many hours and for what? Life is short, and even life - like death - can have no real meaning.

It's the central existential creepiness of our modern lives.  The loss of meaning means there are no answers - and you can't call avoiding the question an ""answer"", just as finding an ""answer"" in crackpot religions, cults, alcohol, drugs, depression, etc. isn't even remotely an answer either.  The question - and the answer - are open-ended.

The story is as threadbare as it gets: people are disappearing; no one knows how or why, few are left, the end.  I found absolutely nothing compelling about this film.  It was like watching paint dry, as I impatiently waited for something to happen to prove the claim that this was ""the scariest film of the year!""  Unfortunately, only time wasted away, nothing in the way of a story ever developed.

Then why weren't they seen and why were people disappearing?  No explanation, no answer, just weird emblematic clues like red tape on doors, stains on walls and floors, computers that turn themselves on, people muttering ""help,"" and a lot of forbidden rooms that contain absolutely nothing but junk and poor lighting.

2476385,2,B000E0OE4O,"One inevitable problem with movies that focus on technology is that they tend not to age well, and Pulse is no exception. This movie starts off with characters fumbling around with floppy disks and dial-up internet, and generally treating the home computer like it's a device for controlling advanced rocketry. On top of that, the film quality looks a bit grainy, like a movie from the 70s, and the special effects are not terribly convincing.
Nonetheless, once the movie got going it had some strong points. Although there weren't any really terrifying moments for me, certain scenes were definitely creepy. I'll admit that it wasn't as scary as I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised that the movie's themes were much better thought-out and explored than in most horror movies. Through its exploration of the place of ""ghosts"" in the real world, Pulse muses on death, existential despair, and the fear of loneliness.
Towards the end of the movie however, I started to get more and more confused. Somehow I missed the logic of the transition from figurative solitude to a literal post-apocalyptic world.

Overall, this movie failed to scare me, and certain turns in the plot left me perplexed. However, it's biggest redeeming factor is it's open contemplation of certain horror tropes, particularly the fear of being alone. The movie leaves you with something to think about regarding the horror genre and human nature in general, but overall I would say that it has too many flaws to really qualify as a great horror movie.",1322092800,3,1529,4.97265625
2476386,2,B000E0OE4O,"Watching PULSE was, ultimately, a frustrating experience for me.

The whole thing just did not mesh together.

There was so much to like, the underplayed and quite believable male lead, the sustained mood of dread, some incredible cinematography which served the plot and wasn't overly ""showy"".

However,  I found certain aspects got way too much in the way for me to lose myself in the story and the environment created on screen.

First- something I've noticed in more than a few Japanese horror films- awkward, all-in-one-go information-dump sequences where one character blurts out the legend or history of the supernatural menace. So, instead of several characters slowly gathering clues and bits of information, thus sustaining viewer interest, we get the equivalent of Simon Oakland explaining everything with psychobabble at the end of PSYCHO. I felt it brought everything to an unnecessary halt.

Second, some embarassingly amateurish cuts between scenes. Really jarring- undermined the unique lighting and cinematography as well as the narrative. (however, some of the abrupt cuts really work- for example, a sudden change of scene to an exterior close-up of the male lead standing under an umbrella in the driving rain.) The few bits of added cgi were too crisp to seem like they were part of the grainy, dark environment of the story.

And, third- a tone which wavers awkwardly between frightening dream-logic and explainable cause-and-effect. I was reminded of the one thing which bothered me about the director's other film CURE, and that is- WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE CARRY FLASHLIGHTS? I just can't ""buy"" characters who have been SHOWN to be extremely timid suddenly walking right into a completely unlit, unknown building or room- ALONE. Hearing a voice or being concerned for an acquaintance just doesn't sell this for me.

And, fourth- I hate to say it, but, just once, can we have a J-Horror ghost WITHOUT long, black hair? I was so relieved to see no spectres with long, black, unkept hair and THEN, in a scene which in EVERY other way was absolutely TERRIFYING, there's the darned long, black hair. Disappointing in a film which in so many ways strives to be different. Perhaps all one really needs is a good pair of scissors and a blow dryer to fend off these ghosts.

I feel I can only recommend the film as an opportunity to see some really well-filmed sequences, a few of which truly are QUITE haunting. That, and the refreshing chance to see a non-model-good-looks male lead pretty much carry a film and believably transition from barely-verbal misfit to determined protagonist.",1321488000,3,2602,5.046620046620046

2476390,2,B000E0OE4O,"I was so excited to finally watch ""Pulse"" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.

The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". ""Pulse"" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.

Along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. I hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. It seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. Unlike ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plotline, ""Pulse"" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. My closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. At first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the Internet. That's a damn original idea. I like that. But as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.

I realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. I will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.

The actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if I was more enthralled by the story I would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. Like I mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. Perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. To be honest I don't really care.

The acting was decent. Certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. No outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.

Now I'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. One towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, I would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. I thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. The things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and ""WTF"" for me to truly appreciate.

Now for something pertaining to the DVD itself... Magnolia's release of ""Pulse"" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. They aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. It may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. I think this is the only North American release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING!!!)

I tried to like the film, I really did. I WANTED this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. If you're looking for other creepy Asian cinema I can recommend you ""Audition"", ""Shutter"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""Strange Circus"" and ""Marebito"" -- all of which are more my palette.

Certain elements of the original source weren't translated well for the american remake, that's why I recommend this film, Kairo, and not the version made by Dimension Pictures.

After all, people speak of ""hanging out"" in a chat room or online forum, when in reality they have neither left their house nor met another person face to face.  Although this theme has relevance everywhere, it may strike a bit closer to home in Japan, which has seen the social phenomenon of the ""hikikomori"" in recent years.

2476396,5,B000E0OE4O,"This is a uniquely Japanese horror movie, with little in the way of gore or jump-out-of-your seat thrills.  Instead it slides inexorably into a vision of an apocalyptic world arising not out of atom bombs but alienation.  Its perspective is fundamentally existentialist; all but a few of the characters talk about loneliness, how no one can ever be connected to anyone else, the essential isolation of being human -- even after death.  This is a starkly horrifying concept in the context of Japanese culture, but might not translate as effectively into horror for American viewers (since we all think we're unconnected individuals already!).  Like one of the earlier reviewers, I don't recommend it for neophytes to Japanese horror because the story does seem disconnected -- although it makes sense at the end, there's a lot for your own mind to fill in, which I find to be especially effective, because we'll each fill in our own fear).  As the movie moved towards its conclusion, I felt a sense of dread that I haven't felt while watching a horror movie in a long, long time.  Not a masterpiece, but a work of philosophic art and profoundly disturbing.",1218326400,5,1155,4.86734693877551
2476397,5,B000E0OE4O,"The philosophical premise of Kairo is nihilism expressed through loneliness. The superficial ""connections"" that one sustains with other people are conveyed as brittle, meaningless trivialities that shatter when confronted with the relentless isolation that exists on a much deeper level. Not one person is murdered in this 119 minute film for the very fact that the victims are consumed with a sense of eternal loneliness - many times caused by seeing spirits - and therefore take their own lives. There are no cheap scares in this picture, as it relies on disturbing, long-sustained images highlighted by awkward ghost movements. Classic scenes and imagery abound in this tour de force directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.

Kiyoshi is a criminally unknown director who is undoubtedly the single best filmmaker in the history of horror cinema. Unfortunately, many people confuse greatness with influence. Hideo Nakata is not a great director, but he did influence the entire film-making industry with Ringu. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, on the other hand, just makes great films - Kairo, Cure, Charisma, Retribution, Sance, Loft, etc. That's the essential difference between excellence and mere market influence. Now, Kiyoshi does get some respect from both moviegoers and critics alike, but there are some common complaints that I would like to address in conjunction with this review of Kairo.

The most outrageous criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films lack content. This is a patently false (and downright ridiculous) claim that holds no weight whatsoever. Taking Kairo as an example, there are a number of subtle references to LONELINESS throughout the entirety of the film - the literal isolation of characters, the individual dots expressed within the computer program, the patterns of dissolved ash, the influence of communication and information through both ghostly apparitions as well as red tape, apocalyptic doom, suicide, character mannerisms and interrelationships, etc. In other words, there's a boatload of content in Kairo. Those who say otherwise have no idea what they're talking about.

This structure of film-making is one thing that makes Kiyoshi so amazing. He takes a simple concept like loneliness and creates a constellation of phenomena that reference back to the underlying theme of the film. The same is true with Cure (identity), Charisma (false dichotomies, relationship between the individual and society), Retribution (memory), Loft (memory), and others. It's a fascinating method of storytelling that's so much fun to watch despite the glacial pacing from which it's presented. Don't fool yourself: the entertainment value of Japanese horror is frequently about content, and Kairo is a perfect horror movie largely because of its philosophical elements. How many other films can make the same claim? What more do you people want?

How the massive quantity of content within Kiyoshi's cinematic portfolio goes unnoticed is beyond me. The only possible explanation is that his stunning talent for creating dense atmosphere leads some viewers to overlook his content. Still, there's no excuse for missing it, especially considering how badly made dramas get all sorts of credit where none is due. For example, there are tons of reviews for Tsai Ming-liang's dreadfully atrocious Viva L'Amour that gloat about that movie's depiction of solitude. I read these reviews with the knowledge that Kairo gets little to no credit for its truly amazing portrayal of loneliness. The whole scenario makes me want to puke.

Another criticism of Kiyoshi is that his films are ""self-indulgent."" What a load of twaddle coming from reviewers who consider Akira Kurosawa to be the best thing since sliced bread. Anyone dim-witted enough to claim that Akira Kurosawa's Dreams is less indulgent than Kairo should immediately check themselves into a mental institution. So Akira gets a free pass at self-masturbatory cinema because some Californian bloodsuckers propped him up on an undeserving pedestal? You people are a joke. From the standpoint of sheer directorial precision and scriptwriting, Akira doesn't even deserve to sniff Kiyoshi's jockstrap.

Then we have all sorts of assertions that say Kiyoshi's films are slow and boring, but most of these comments are made by Hollywood fanboys who drool over rat-infested garbage like Friday the 13th, Freddy vs. Jason, and Alien vs. Predator. I would expect this reaction from those with such narrow-minded ""tastes"" in film. Just leave the intelligent horror cinema to the big boys and go back to worshipping overrated hacks like Wes Craven.

But that's not all. We have even more ludicrous complaints coming from Westerners like, ""The Japanese take their horror films too seriously."" I laugh when hearing stuff like this. God forbid someone actually puts some effort into making a horror film. Has the Hollywood horror industry really crumbled to the point where even their most fervent followers don't expect anything remotely ambitious? That's a pretty pathetic state to be in.

The point of this review-turned-rant is to simply point out the obvious: Kiyoshi Kurosawa is the greatest horror filmmaker that ever lived. It might just be my opinion, but considering how any and all criticism seems to be based on illogic or narrow-mindedness, there's really no valid reason for believing otherwise.",1210118400,7,5345,5.362336114421931

Similar to ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", the plot was a little hard to grasp and tended to jump around. The characters were not that developed, except for the young guy who played the lead, so it was kind of hard to get a handle on who was who and what their relationship to one another was. Basically, a young guy commits suicide and his friends are thrust into a strange world of spirits, ghosts, and odd images on computers. There are some genuinely creepy images and scenes.

If your scary-bone is ultra sensitive to the eerie (as opposed to hacker/slasher shock value) then this movie will haunt the pants off of you.

I felt that the plot's pacing/timing was perfect, and even the most frightening things had a way of coming off remarkably understated, which made it even creepier. The visuals are what truly make this film as terrifying as it is; lighting, use of color, staging of actors. It's quite brilliant. 45 minutes into watching it I knew that this was the scariest movie I had ever seen. (Besides ""Wait Until Dark"" with Audrey Hepburn.)",1204156800,2,737,4.6183206106870225

2476418,3,B000E0OE4O,"When I heard that an American movie was coming out last summer called PULSE, and that it was based on a Japanese movie, being the purist that I am I felt compelled me to rent the original in preparation for the remake. Knowing it was a horror movie, and that it came out during the swell of J-Horror films remade into American pictures (THE RING 1 & 2, THE GRUDGE 1 & 2, DARK WATER, etc), it made me look forward even more to getting scared at the hands of the Japanese film industry.

The result? A semi-interesting flick that proved to be more social commentary than grab-the-armrest horror movie.

The acting in PULSE is good. The standouts were the skater-dude Economics major (I'm not joking) who teams up with the Computer Science chick to uncover why all their friends are dying. They really carry the movie. The effects are creepy, especially the jerky, slow-moving ghosts that Japanese horror films do so well. They're like the Mummy or the zombies in any Romero movie: Slow and methodical, but somehow still able to catch their targets. The social commentary is good, not great, mostly dealing with human loneliness and our need to connect on a deeper level with other people.

The negatives of the film for me concern the slow movement of the picture as a whole. There are two main storylines that the movie bounces between, and the constant bouncing does little to establish any kind of momentum. Not until the last third of the movie does it really get going; otherwise, I was pretty bored. And the characters tend to pull some stupid horror movie clichs like investigating strange noises or walking into dark rooms they know they shouldn't walk into. That's pretty par for the course in most American horror movies, but still, I was hoping the Japanese could show us how to make a better scary movie than this.

In the end, I was mildly scared during a few random scenes, as well as disturbed at the ending (which is chilling). As a connoisseur of horror movies, I can say that the Japanese PULSE is better than most modern-day American horror movies, but it's just not scary or fast-paced enough to make it anything more than mediocre. Rent the Japanese versions of THE RING (RINGU) and THE GRUDGE (JU-ON) instead.",1174953600,2,2229,4.66412213740458
2476429,5,B000E0OE4O,"This is an excellent Japanese horror movie. It's thoughtful, creepy, unsettling & very well directed by Kurosawa Kiyoshi. On the one hand you have your standard urban horror themes of loneliness & technology-as-villain (in this case computers & the net). On the other there's this speculation about what might be waiting for us 'on the other side.' Is death, as one of the characters wonders aloud at one point, a chance to be reunited with loved ones & so no longer endure the day to day loneliness of life? But as things turn out, being dead is just as miserable & painful an experience for the ghosts as being alive is for the human characters, something Kurosawa demonstrates in a number of genuinely unsettling sequences.

Kiyoshi has an excellent & mature style - demonstrating a preference for long takes (a style that'll drive impatient teen horror fans up the wall) & shocks achieved within the frame rather than through flashy editing. Two sequences epitomise this - in one a young woman searches an apartment for her co-worker in vain while a shadowy figure rises silently from a chair at the back of the room behind her. It might not sound terribly creepy but honestly I think my heart skipped a beat when that happened. In the other - & this is undoubtedly one of the films most talked about moments - a woman jumps to her death & the camera unblinkingly records her fall & impact with no cutting away.

But don't get the idea this is some J-horror gorefest because it isn't. What's so refreshing for me about 'Pulse' is that rather than harping on gore & shocks for two hours the director takes the time to lay out an intriguing story. One in which ghosts are flooding back into our world because there's no more room in theirs. The only trouble being that when ghosts & real people come into physical contact with each other neither can survive (the humans leave behind a smudgy blackened residue which recalls the blast shadows of Hiroshima victims).

Throughout Pulse Kurosawa balances the increasingly apocalyptic imagery of a hi-tech Tokyo in which life has all but ceased with an insistently humanist theme. Our characters clearly care for each other & the story culminates with a small group of survivors setting sail toward an uncertain future. Meanwhile the heroine of the story comes to realise that having found a temporary happiness with the young student who helped her escape she now has the strength to go on.

I'd like to think that's really what Kurosawa is getting at here. Not for him the simple scares of a ghost story, nor the fashionable sense of nihilism (hey, we're all doomed!) which so appeals to moody teens, but the message that in life the small bonds we make with each other, those passing moments of happiness & kindness, these are what shield us from loneliness & enable us to keep going in an unforgiving universe. Seen that way it makes for an appropriate visual metaphor that the final shot of Pulse is a stunning birds-eye view of a tiny shipful of humanity adrift in a vast ocean.

I look forward to seeing more films by Kurosawa Kiyoshi.

One last point: a sequence in Pulse depicts a jetliner seen from street level falling out of the sky & crashing into a building. On the DVD featurette there's a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a location recce for this particular scene. The date? June 2000. Talk about prophetic.",1174780800,16,3367,4.707979626485569
2476430,5,B000E0OE4O,"PULSE is one of those rare thrillers that thrive in a low budget...and thrive well. Alot of the creepy going ons are hidden in shadows...and just out of the corner of your eye. Just when you least expect it, a chilling shadow will cross your screen...sometimes growing into an all out terror.

Scariest scene is when a guy goes into a room, there are large blood red stains on the wall behind him...and a shadow takes shape in front of him. Completely in terror...the guy stumbles backward over a couch and scurries behind it as the jerking shape moves towards him...reaching over the couch...  You won't shake thast scene for days it's that creepy.

Other things occur throughout the film...usually out of focus or in the background which add to the stifling claustrophobic atmosphere. In one instance, the camera is focused on a young girl pausing on the street. In the backgound way in the distance, you see a blurry figure climb a tower...and jump to it's death. This scene was extremely realistic, but not gory.

And that is where this film succeeds. No gore, but excellent atmosphere.

Alot of the conversations take place from a distance, so it is difficult to discern who the characters are, but for the clothes they are wearing. You cannot see thier faces.

PULSE was also remade by Americans and they, in my opinion, missed the creepy foreboding atmosphere and replaced it with Hollywood special effects, which compromised the whole concept of the film. Watch the Japanese version instead for chills and far better acting.

2476431,5,B000E0OE4O,"Kiyoshi Kurosawa has accomplished here what American and Japanese directors have been attempting (with little success) for the past decade: to create a horror film with merit that involves the internet, television, or any other virtual vehicle for the spooky.  I didn't expect to like this at all because I've grown so disgusted with the kid crawling out of the tv, the kid crawling out of the well, the kid crawling out of both and people turning red/blue/green when people see the kid's face, etc--it was an absurd premise in the first place and the hype surrounding both the original ""Ring"" and the remake nearly killed the magic both had in advance.

I was wrong.  While I don't pretend to completely understand what Kurosawa was trying to say entirely, the painful isolation of modern man is driven home with the aid of technology (computers specifically), and every scene smells of alienation, desolation, and sheer terror.  When Taguchi commits suicide in front of Harue it is a statement of sorts, a kind of rejection and revenge upon one more day of a hollow and frightening life which kickstarts an intentional or unintentional metaphysical revolution.

Setting aside the philosophical message, there scenes in this movie so bone-chilling that I can't help but compare it to classics of the genre.  When Yabe is stalked and confronted by a figure who seems to sway and jerk with the movement of a dial-up hallucination and he hides under the dresser to avoid his/her gaze, the rest of the sequence is unforgettable.

I imagine this will be received differently by many people.  One reviewer mentioned ""Carnival of Souls"" in comparison, and that is absolutely correct, only this transcends ""Carnival of Souls"".  Absolute masterpiece.",1172534400,7,1742,5.041811846689895

I will be completely honest, technologically this is not a great movie. It is presented like the other j-horror films (Grudge, Dark Water, etc.) in a fairly low budget way; little dialogue, thinly dressed sets, lowkey lighting. Physically there isn't a lot here. It is, however, the most unsettling movie I've seen in a long time.

This movie, like the other original j-horror movies, is all about atmosphere. It is creepy in a way that I thought filmmakers had forgotten, but then the Japanese seem to understand the creepiness necessary for the best ghost stories.

There are no monsters. Nothing jumping out to make you jump without providing any other reason than suprise. No gore or blood.

These are good things.

What the film does though is get in your head and, if you have been paying attention to the world around us it makes you realize how isolated we are making ourselves.

It should go without saying that most Americans won't have a clue what the movie is saying. It seems that if there isn't a monster to heap our scorn and anger on there isn't a plot. Most younger Americans especially will be scratching their heads in bewilderment (look at the other reviews). They have no perspective and if it isn't spoonfed to them it isn't important to know.

As the audience we don't always know or have to understand WHY something is happening to the characters. The characters in the movie don't understand what is happening themselves. They're just trying to survive it, which is what life is mostly like.

This movie made me think about it for days after I watched it which is a sign that it's working.

The Japanese ghost story ""Pulse"" provides us with an intriguing premise that is only sporadically well executed.  A kind of ""Carnival of Souls"" for the cyber generation, the film revolves around restless spirits who have figured out a way to use personal computers as portals back into the real world.

Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.  Much of the time we can't tell what is going on, partly because the picture is so grainy, and partly because the screenplay itself is so muddled.  Characters come and go and we have no idea who they are or what indeed is happening to them.  There are, admittedly, some creepy, otherworldly moments in the film, but they are undercut by the desultory pacing and the overall lack of clarity.  Valiantly, the filmmakers have thrown in a few existentialist comments about the pointlessness and loneliness of existence, but they aren't nearly sufficient to help the movie overcome its many weaknesses.

An admirable failure, ""Pulse"" at least earns points for trying - but not for succeeding in its endeavor.",1163894400,10,1147,4.9375
2476434,5,B000E0OE4O,"I love horror movies. Love them. Sometimes though, that love keeps me from enjoying alot of them. I feel I've seen so many that typical scares don't work anymore. Or is it that most movies are so derivative and void of any true desire to unsettle an audince that they really don't work on anyone. Either way, theres nothing more frustrating than going to see a movie that you expect to scare you and realizing that its just more of the same crap. I love either having a good time with a horror movie or being terrified by it and Kairo definatly fits into the latter category.
  The story is basically a simple one, ghosts are taking over by using the internet to breach our world. Anyone who encounters one can't take it and kills themselves. Thats pretty much it, on the surface... but the movie has so much more going on for it as far as a statement about how technology is driving us as humans apart, but thats not why we're watching it is it? The main question is, is it scary and I can answer ""oh my God yes!""
  The first half of the movie adds so many subtle touches and presents scenes that end in jarring scares in such a way that they shock you and make you realize you haven't seen anything like this before. kurosawa knows how to craft a scene that seems to be going nowhere end with a bang, but a quiet one. Thats what got me, the fact that I almost never saw the scares coming and they were so a part of the scenery almost that it really seemed as if Id just seen a ghost, until the first time you actually see one in all its glory creeping towards one of the lead characters. I can truly say I've never seen a ghost in any movie  move like that and I don't know that I want to again. Movies like this show whats missing in most big-budget horror movies today,atmosphere and a genuine willingness to unnerve a crowd. The second half however can't hold on to the genuinly terrifying moments of the first, but involves you as the story goes deeper and the characters figure out what is happening to them...and the world.

2476435,1,B000E0OE4O,"The latest trend in horror is to address an old idea: the struggle of characters against and unidentifiable force that will always have power over them. There is a nice tension available in these kinds of works, that of anxious rage against insurmountable powers. But when does that tension just become a bland montage of vague threats that leave the lack of resolution disappointing rather than empathic? Pulse falls in the disappointing category--there are nice overtones of the problem with an overly technical world, but these are highly unrealized, and the movie seems to prefer pulling away from any kind of empathy rather than truly trying to scare the s*** out of the audience by letting them in just enough to really fear what they don't know.",1161129600,8,752,4.929133858267717

Both films are concerned with themes of human connection, separation (alternately dealt with by the name of 'mortality', at times), and redemption, and both leave a lot to the discernment of the individual viewer.

As an example, both films depend heavily on dramatic bass-notes that create a disturbing and insistent sense of the impending in the viewer. The difference is that Tarkovsky accomplishes this through subtle clues on a psychological level, without excessive dialogue and, essentially, without much sound at all. Pulse, on the other hand, cleverly dispenses with all but the auditory soundscape, and establishes emotional cues through the minimalistic device of a constantly-rumbling, unassociated, deep-bass noise that increases and decreases according to when the viewer is meant to be scared stiff. This makes Pulse a much easier movie to watch than Zerkalo, because ultimately it makes far less sense.

With that said, if you go into Pulse expecting jump out at you frights or a nail biting scarefest you will be disappointed.  Pulse is a quiet, slowly paced atmospheric thriller. It's very surreal.  Many, many things are never explained (the red tape for example) and you may not actually ""get"" it when it's over.  Not to say that this is a bad film, it's not.  There's plenty of scares (the scene with the couch for example) that make the film play out like a nightmare (check out Kurosawa's Cure which is another quiet nightmarish thriller that is as good, if not better, than Pulse).  My only complaint is at two hours long Pulse easily could have been shorter and just as effective.  A must see for any J-horror fan.

2476459,4,B000E0OE4O,"Kairo (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, 2001)

While Kiyoshi Kurosawa is no relation to the great Akira Kurosawa, he does seem to be Japan's most likely director, at the present time, to fill the master's shoes. Kairo is another stunning set piece in his arsenal, a worthy successor to Kurosawa's previous films and a fine work in its own right.

Kurosawa's trademark impressionist style haunts this tale of the ghosts in the machine. It follows, alternately, two characters-- Michi (Casshern's Kumiko Aso), a worker at a greenhouse, and Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato), a University student, as they live through an apocalypse about which few people know anything except that it involves people disappearing (or committing suicide) and red duct tape. It seems to be connected to a website called The Forbidden Room, which keeps appearing mysteriously on Kawashima's computer.

Kairo is to Japanese horror film what Akira is to anime; it has become exceptionally well-known in a very short amount of time, but it's probably not the best film for beginners to start off with. While the storyline is linear, it's told in such a piecemeal fashion, leaving a good deal to the viewer's imagination, that those new to the particularly Japanese style of making horror films might find it a bit hard to follow. (This is generally true of Kurosawa's films; his Silence of the Lambs homage, Cure, follows the same general path. Hideo Nakata's best film, Chaos, is another example.) It would be better for the Japanese horror neophyte to start off with Nakata's justly-famous Ring and Dark Water to get a taste of the wonderful atmosphere of Japanese horror before diving into the wonderful world of Kurosawa; that said, his films are a must for any horror film aficionado looking for the cutting edge of the medium. Once you've gotten into the spirit of Japanese horro, get to know Kiyoshi Kurosawa's work. You won't regret it. ****",1151452800,15,1901,5.0094936708860756
2476460,4,B000E0OE4O,"Kairo or ""Pulse"" as it's unforunately loosely translated isn't driven by plot or characters but the theme of loneliness and the visual manifestations of said theme. Kiyoshi Kurosawa fills his film with haunting imagery to evoke feelings of alienation: The opening shots of Michi standing alone on the deck of a boat , bloodless but disturbing depictions of suicide, surreal images of people disappearing into their shadows, and finally the empty streets of the film's climax.

The fear of dying alone is a strong sub-theme that provides much of the film's horror elements. The ghosts of the film are merely normal people lurking in the shadows, a constant reminder of our morality. There is no god or happy afterlife in this film, death is but a continuation of the isolation we face as individuals during our mortal lives. The film's look is of washed grey and green colors, adding to the surreal feel. This is not a movie to be interupted literally, not even the internet plot.

While the film has it's fair share of unsettling moments and almost unbearable dread the true horror is the unthinkable thoughts it provokes, the fact that human beings are individuals mentally disconnected from each other, we are born alone and we die alone, and that is truly terrifying.  This is true for the characters as well, despite teased relationships no one connects in a satisfying way like you would expect them to, they are all alone in the beginning of the movie and remain so until the end. The film is slow moving with things as big as plane crashes coming off as being incredibly subtle, so viewers looking for big scares, indepth characters, a coherent plot, or just plain traditional film making be warned.

Yeah, 'Pulse' has got a number of creepy moments, and it could be decent if you chopped it down by 40 minutes, but at this length it's just remarkably tiresome.  The characters are utterly unmemorable and the the horror scenes themselves are generic, played out Asian horror cliches.  They're passably well done as far as that kinda thing goes, but nothing exciting and the movie has a remarkable amount of down time which is filled simplistic, existentialist prattling.  People wanna tell you this says something about alienation in the technological age, but it doesn't, nothing beyond the basic assertion that we are alienated.

Not recommended.  If you wanna see some Kiyoshi Kurosawa films, check out 'Cure' or 'Doppelganger' or maybe 'Seance'.  (Though that last one definitely ain't great.)

I haven't seen anything like this before, there was no flashy orchestra or bass-filled techno music... just silence. This made the movie more enjoyble and also set the mood for its themes of immense loneliness. People looking for instantaneous fright and truckloads of blood should just go rent a Friday the 13th flick, this movie scares you in a different way... It explores things alot of us really -don't- want to think about, such as suicide and the afterlife.

This movie has pretty good quotes too. ""I was alone in life, but death is eternal loneliness."" And also the way it portrays the internet as being something that only increases people's loneliness. ""People don't really connect, you know... They're just like those dots in the program representing humans. We all live totally separate."" The pain of loss when Michii turns into specks of ash which fly out the window and her friend tries to catch them screaming ""Don't go!"" The apocalyptic sense of being the last two people left alive in the world.

An american remake is being made by Wes Craven which I think will spell everything out in a way that will be more digestible for the western audience.",1142121600,5,1377,4.70954356846473
2476465,5,B000E0OE4O,"First off, this is the kind of movie that's either gonna resinate with you and hold your soul up against a wall until it stains, or it's just gonna slide off of you and you'll walk away from it cursing it as a waste of your valuable time. It is pure ""art-house horror"", (which obviously I'm a huge fan of), and it works into you with atmosphere and imagery kind of like, as another reviewer suggested, a Lynch or a Cronenberg film.

Like what ""Mulholland Drive"" did to the traditional tragic love story, this does for the traditional ghost story...it turns it on its head and reverberates through you, causing you to think about it and feel its effects long after the viewing. It inserts creepy and puzzling imagery with long bouts of meloncholic silence and contemplation in between. It is not fast paced, but slow and deliberate, as if each strange occurance is timed just right to slowly awaken the characters as well as the audience to its larger agenda.

It is, for lack of a better word, haunting. And it does this because between the lines and beyond the sealed door and behind the glowing screen, we begin to realize, it is US. It really isn't as much a ghost story as it is an interesting statement on what society is becoming with the progression of values based on individuality as opposed to community.

If you don't want to think about this kind of stuff when watching a horror film, then you will hate it. But if you enjoy the kind of horror film that haunts you because it has more on its mind than just making you piss your pants with orchestral hits and the severing of limbs, then you will probably at the very least appreciate its efforts. For me, it's because it does achieve its higher goals so well that I rank it as my all-time favorite from the ""J-Horror"" genre - if not my favorite horror film of all time.",1142121600,6,1831,4.443452380952381
2476466,5,B000E0OE4O,"First off, let me say that a lot of people who see this movie were probably expecting a gory, horrific tale (judging from the dvd cover), but it is much, much more in-depth then that. In my most recent viewing of the movie, I have found a more metaphorically ""layered"" film that begs to be viewed more than once to fully understand it's context. I assume most people only see it once, then they put it off as ""boring"" or ""non-comprehensible"" afterwards. That is somewhat true if your'e going into the film expecting cheaps thrills, scares and gore, but this is the kind of film that requires patience and analysis, actions that are rarely required for horror films nowadays....

The director, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, has always been an advocate for supplying his horror films with more than just horror; he delves into the pyschological state of his characters presenting the viewer with a better sense of what the characters motives are in his movies. He shoots PULSE with a keen eye to the enviroment and showcases a steadily deterioration of that enviroment in which the story takes place. Decayed buildings, dark hallways, and natural lighting give the movie a dark tone that stays with the viewer throughout the whole movie. I also have to note the philosophical overtone that the film presents as well; that the technology that supposedly binds us closer, in fact drives us further apart. Great premise and direction.

As for the casting, I personally felt the they played their parts well, showcasing the terror and isolation they experience in a believable fashion. I specifically appreciated Haruhiko Kato's performance, who plays Kawashima in the film. His willingness to discover the truth about what is happening to the world seems very believable. The other two big named actors (to Japanese movie-goers at least) are Kumiko Aso and Koyuki, the latter playing in the movie ""The Last Samurai"". Their performances were believable as well.

As for the music, most of it was just ambient noise which just seems fitting for this type of movie. It created a eery atmosphere that heightened certain scenes in the film.

So for my final words, I have to say this; Pulse is a pure psychological thriller/horror, but it's more to the liking of say, Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"" with the atmosphere of David Fincher's ""Seven"". The horror or fear aspect of the film truly comes from the atmosphere rather than blood or violence, which I believe is totally absent from the film. So is it a masterpiece? I would have to say a profoundly ""Yes"", but please view it multiple times and just let it sink in, then you will truly the beauty that is ""PULSE"".",1142121600,8,2645,4.845132743362832
2476467,4,B000E0OE4O,"This movie really creeped me out. Tha pace was slow, but there was never a moment when I felt bored. I liked the fact that there were two story lines going on and at the end, characters from the different story lines meet.

What started out as a ghost story turned into a a metaphor for the state of human lonliness. The only problem I had were the subtitles. The character would speak and then there was a delay in the subtitles. Just as you were trying to understand what was said, the subtitle from what was said ten seconds ago would pop up while the next character was speaking. A bit distracting.

There wasn't blood and gore, but the suspense was built on not knowing what was going to happen and when. This movie is not for people who look for evil to be personified. The evil was the eternal lonliness after death and the way humans are connected, yet disconnected through modern technology, internet, cell phones etc.

I also likes the scenery. No neon lights of Tokyo, instead, seedy streets and buildings with gray, gloomy interiors. This really set the mood for the doom that's to come.",1141948800,,1099,4.5125628140703515

8103300,2,B000E0OE4O,"Two separate groups of people discover a mysterious website. Kudo Michi is introduced to it when a co-worker casually commits suicide while she's in his apartment and finds images of it on a CD of his. Ryosuke stumbles upon the site when connecting to his new internet and sees videos of people acting strangely. Both people struggle to find out about the website and what it means.

Pulse is a strange movie that doesn't feel as familiar as others in its genre. The two parallel stories are a little odd because they don't have anything to do with each other save the website until extremely late into the movie. Both main characters are nice, well meaning people. Kudo wants to know why her coworker committed suicide and in such on odd way, leaving behind a black grease mark. Ryosuke wants to know more about the website that seemed almost like snuff films. He understandable shut off in terror after a man put a plastic bag over his head. He befriends a woman named Harue who drastically changes since he introduced her to the site.

The film brings up the fear of death and the possibility of contacting the dead. Harue is one of the people that can't handle being faced with her own mortality, but becomes comfortable with it when she's convinced she won't be alone as she feared. The situation worsens until it's a complete apocalypse situation. I didn't completely enjoy it because this aspect seemed to come out of nowhere. We follow these two characters' stories and then suddenly Tokyo is deserted. The film also moves glacially slow and didn't have enough scares or interesting events to keep my interest throughout the movie. It started off so well with unnerving images, but couldn't keep up the momentum for me.

Pulse is a unique film in it's approach, tone, and story telling. The concept of the dead returning to create a world wide situation is interesting, but the actual story lost me somewhere along the way. There are interesting concepts and images, including this red duct tape that somehow denotes the involvement of the dead and the stains left on the wall by the dead. However, they didn't seem to connect and weren't explained at all. They came off as a not well thought out collection of unsettling images. It might be a cultural reference or concept that I'm not familiar with. I can't say I recommend it.",1514505600,,2337,4.709046454767726

8103303,3,B000E0OE4O,"In the early 2000s a string of horror films were made in Japan that has been referred to as J-horror. These films were huge hits there and made their way to the US where fans were fascinated with them. So much so that Hollywood took notice and began remaking them left and right. Probably most famous of these are THE RING and THE GRUDGE. Another early entry was PULSE starring Kristen Bell but it wasn't as well received. Now Arrow Video has released a great version of the original film on blu-ray for fans to enjoy.

The story involves two separate groups of friends experiencing paranormal encounters that are leaving a mark on them, some literally. The first group works together in a business that supplies plants to buyers. When their tech guy fails to show for work or answer his phone, they check up on him. While there, he walks into another room and hangs himself. Gruesome enough but then they begin to look at a disc he left behind which shows ghostly images from his apartment. A return visit has them exposed to his ghost as well.

The second story involves a college student who finds something odd going on as well. When he asks a professor to help, they too discover ghostly images online. These images have an effect on some that view them and they begin to disappear. As someone hypothesizes what happens to souls when they leave here? Do they go to another dimension? And then the question is raised what happens when, after the millions that have died over time, that dimension begins to fill up? Do they try and make their way back?

Eventually the two stories intersect with the leads of both uniting to try and discover the answer to these questions. It is their journey and what they discover that makes the film more chilling than you would expect.

Some will be turned off to the way this story unfolds. The back and forth between tales, the dismal look of the entire landscape and the somber tone that it emits start to finish. This is not an in your face or jump start scare style film. It is one that creeps into you, crawls under your skin and makes you look over your shoulder even though you know nothing is there. It takes the ghost story weve become acquainted with and melds it with the world of computers, even if these computers look cumbersome since the movie was made in 2001. The pace is slow as the horror unfolds before your eyes. This makes for a movie that deserves attention.

Arrow Video, as always, presents this in the best form possible with a hi def 1080p transfer. The extras include a new interview with writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a new interview with cinematographer Junichiro Hayashi, THE HORROR OF ISOLATION a new video appreciation featuring Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett, an archive making of documentary, premiere footage from the Cannes Film Festival, cast and crew introductions from the opening day screenings in Tokyo, trailers and TV spots and a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork.",1506988800,,2969,4.680076628352491
