8711589,5,B00VX1VXMY,"ABSOLUTELY deserving of 5 stars! i've been a ""Jack the Ripper"" movie and documentary buff since i was a teen. So much did i become a buff, that after a while, nothing presented through movie or documentary would any more engage my interest or curiosity. However, i've watched this particular documentary movie-like presentation from beginning through its' end with a livened enthusiasm! this documentary is excellent!!!",1532390400,,419,5.363636363636363

8711591,5,B00VX1VXMY,"If you are at all interested in Jack the Ripper, then this docudrama is perfect for you. It is chock full of evidence photos and the most learned ""Ripperologists"" discussing the case. This film leaves out all the fluff nonsense and wild theories and focuses on the facts of the case. Highly recommend.!",1522454400,2,302,4.716981132075472

8711594,5,B00VX1VXMY,"Are you kidding me!  JTR - The Definitive Story is THE best DVD about Jack and you don't produce it for Zone 1!  After all this time, you are still  cutting out the American purchasing public by making it only available in Europe Zone 2.  SHAME ON YOU!  When will it be available in Zone 1 format?",1487635200,3,297,4.140350877192983
