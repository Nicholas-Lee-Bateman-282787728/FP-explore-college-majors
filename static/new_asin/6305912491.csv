But when  she's had time alone, she decides to sell the kids. Only nobody wants the  little monsters who have plans for Bev too! It's fun, light laughs, good  family flick.",967680000,5,309,4.482142857142857

7897360,5,6305912491,This movie is hilarious.  Beverly D'Angelo nails the role of the crazy drunk ex con babysitter.  I had several laugh out loud moments while watching!

7897365,2,6305912491,I did not comploetely see all of this because it was so poorly acted and so much rediculous sterotyped footage that I stopped and gave it to my grandaughter who loved it.  Go figure.,1215216000,2,182,4.352941176470588
7897366,5,6305912491,"The Crazysitter is, simply put, ""the greatest film of all time.""  If you are asking yourself, ""Should I, a lover of quality cinema, own The CrazySitter?,"" then your answer is absoloutly.  The performances by themselves would be enough to earn the ""two-thumbs up"" it received from Ebert, but when combined with masterful direction and stunning cinematography it rivals Citizen Kane.  Michael McDonald, from Revenge of the Nerds 3 fame, has given us a chilling, lurid tale of betrayal, lust, and seduction.  Fun for the whole family.",1012521600,6,531,5.1395348837209305
