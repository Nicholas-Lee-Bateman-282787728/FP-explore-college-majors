it stars hulk hogan carl weathers and shannon tweed as they rescue kidnapped gymnasts from a druglord played by billy drago.
 now i want to say that i don't know whats up with the title. when i saw this on tv it  was the FIRST movie and called assault on devils island.
the 2nd movie i don't remember what it was called on tv though i have heard ""hunt for the death merchant"" and ""assault on death mountain"" were other names the dvd is simply called shadow warriors and listed as the first movie. title confusion aside its a great action movie that should not be missed. and on a parental note there is some brief nudity for those concerned",1496707200,,711,4.2592592592592595
