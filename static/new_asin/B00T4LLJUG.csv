When a group of friends are denied a loan they are desperate for money. They come up with a plan to kidnap the founder of the Heineken beer company (Hopkins) and ask for a large ransom in exchange. What starts off as a great idea, little by little begins to unravel. This movie is based on a true story and this is something I knew nothing about. The movie itself started off good and I was interested but the longer it went on the less interested I seemed to get. Im not sure why, the acting was good and the interactions between the kidnappers was entertaining but this was another movie that I had a hard time staying focused on. It really seemed to stumble toward the end and this was another movie that I was thankful that it wasn't longer. Overall, I wondered why a movie with this cast didn't have a wider release, after watching it I can see why. I disappointingly give this a C.",1426464000,,1007,4.333333333333333

6999963,3,B00T4LLJUG,"The film is based on a true story. In 1982 Amsterdam, A group of out of work construction workers, who have experienced the good life, are desperate for money. Their idea is to kidnap Freddy Heineken for ransom.

The film takes about 30 minutes until the kidnapping, establishing background and minor chracter build up. At this point the film becomes a drama about kidnappers buyers' angst. The action was sparse and not spectacular. Oh, there was a car chase and some gun fire.

This film opens with Freddy Heineken (Anthony Hopkins) talking, giving me Hannibal flashbacks. In fact that was all I could think about as where this film goes in the Hannibal chronology until he was off screen.

This is at times a boring crime drama. 3 stars is generous

6999964,1,B00T4LLJUG,"""Kidnapping Mr. Heineken"" turned out to be a disappointing film even IF Sir. Anthony Hopkins
Whom plays Mr. Heineken himself is part of the cast to try using it to draw you into watching it due to his high caliber reputation in the film community, after all it appears he just accepted this role to earn a quick buck, using his name to lure you into paying for it. DON'T FALL INTO THE TRAP especially if you happen to be a fan of Mr. Hopkin's movies!. The film has NO direction whatsoever and the script seems like someone put it down in paper, toilet paper that is, while using the bathroom.
By the way the film is about 90 minutes long and  IF you were to edit together the amount of time Hopkins was in it all together should come out to total of like 20 minutes spread out through the film.
The script does not give you any perspectives into allowing you to know each of the character's roles background. All they come up with is these five good friends (2 of them brothers) which their view of life is to try and take the easy way out to not live a normal life with a regular job wasting their life while at it.
So the father, of the two brothers, which turns out to be a good friend of Mr. Heineken and even
Worked for the man but got fired for some reason they never tell you and even so still drinks the beer and defends him against his sons, gives the group of five the idea to what else? Well, kidnap Mr. Heineken and demand a hefty large ramson amount of money for his life, but wait, they need to make it look like if they were some high organized group of professional criminals and for that they need money too buy machine guns and a few other items.
However, without having any money  to purchase those things well the next best thing is to ""rob a bank""!.
Which they did successfully and got away with a substantial amount of money. So why then proceed with kidnapping Mr. Heineken?.well,:GREED,:I Guess!.""only possible logical explanation right? After robbing the bank why proceed with the original misguided idea?
Movie had bad direction, bad script, poor acting especially coming from other cast members like
Sam Worthington (Terminstor: Salvation, Savages).well, to make long story short as this as they said at beginning was ""based on a true story,:you can come to a conclusion as to how it ends when a group of rookie kidnappers got cold feet, even before they commit their original
Idea/plan.
As I say don't waste your money and wait till it comes out on Netflix or public network or waste your money like I did. For 8 dollars I paid for this a 6 pack of Heineken would have been worth it",1426377600,2,2610,4.390495867768595

6999969,4,B00T4LLJUG,"3.5/5  I love 'heist' movies and today's Film on Friday entry falls into that category, with a bit of a twist. Instead of robbery, its kidnapping. And as the title says - Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is indeed the taking of beer magnate Freddy Heineken. What made this a must watch for me is that it's true. All of it. In 1983, a group of friends trying to save their legitimate enterprises needed money desperately. And one of them has the idea to kidnap Freddy Heineken. They do - and  they collect what was the largest ransom ever at that time. But did it solve their problems?

Based on crime journalist Peter R. de Vriess 1987 book, Kidnapping Mr. Heineken takes us from the idea, to the planning, to the execution and -  the aftermath.

""There are two ways a man can be rich in this world - he can have a lot of money or he can have a lot of friends - but he cannot have both.""

These are the opening lines from Anothony Hopkins (Freddy Heineken). I love Hopkin's voice - it's so rich and sonorous, making you stop and listen with every nuance he injects into his lines. In this case it's quite prophetic. From a tight knit group in the beginning, the relationships and trust between the friends disintegrates. And Alfredson follows the dissolution with his camera.

I was fascinated with the story and ended up reading much more about it on the Internet. Truth is stranger than fiction. There's much more the story 'after' but Kidnapping Mr. Heineken does a good job of bringing this fascinating piece of crime history to the screen.

I thought the cast was good - Hopkins as always is a standout for me. His character does not act like a victim at all - there were shades of Hannibal in some of his innocent yet loaded comments. The rest of the cast was great but I did have trouble not seeing Ryan Kwanten as his True Blood character. The struggle between between brothers in law Cor (Sturgess) and Willem (Worthington) over direction and leadership was well played. Worthington also never disappoints me. The movie was actually shot in the Netherlands - the settings added much to the overall tone of the film.

Kidnapping Mr. Heineken stars Anthony Hopkins, Jim Sturgess, Sam Worthington, Ryan Kwanten, Mark Van Eewen, Thomas Cocquerel and Jemima West. Written by William Brookfield and directed by Daniel Alfredson. Interestingly, another film from the Netherlands was made in 2011 based on this same set of events.

Not a 'you must go see', but definitely entertaining. Sit down with a Heineken at home one night and enjoy.",1425600000,29,2531,4.629464285714286

I hope this director gets a chance to make a big blockbuster or an international spy movie sometime as I feel his style is real boss. No scene dragged for too long and the actors delivered all that was needed with sound motivations. Not a ton of history given about Mr. Heineken but I'm cool with that since the plot rolled out well. I guess we could have found out that Mr. H was a lonely man since he said you can't be rich and have good friends, you can't have both he stated to the greedy kidnapper. It would've stamped his message home to see his depression, perhaps he wasn't lonely in real life so the movie didn't want to lie there.  It's also nice to see a film that doesn't feel the need to overbloat the ending with nonsense, even for a true story. I've seen true stories that are turned into Rambo movies just for the hell of it.

6999981,5,B00T4LLJUG,"Peter R. de Vries both participated in and wrote the book about this true story from 1983 and collaborated on the screenplay with William Brookfield for this non-stop rousing caper film with a very bright young cast of actors directed by Daniel Alfredson. The film is well made, well photographed, well scored with an excellent musical selection and arrangement, and very well acted by a fine cast of young actors.

In 1983, a group of childhood friends - Cor van Hout (Jim Sturgess), Willem Holleeder (Sam Worthington_ Jan Cat Boellard (Ryan Kwanten), Frans sSpikes Meijer (Mark van Weuwen), Martin Brakes Erkmpps (Thomas Cocquerel) - pulled off the crime of the century: kidnapping one of the richest men in the world, the heir of the Heineken beer empire (Anthony Hopkins). The shocking capture --by gunpoint in broad daylight on the streets of Amsterdam--resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for a kidnapped individual. It was truly the perfect crimeuntil they got away with it. This is the inside story of the planning, execution, rousing aftermath and ultimate downfall of the kidnappers which resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for an individual.

For a fast moving credible caper, this is a fine film, never letting down for a moment. Grady Harp, December 15",1450569600,,1276,5.014150943396227

6999987,5,B00T4LLJUG,"Better than I expected.  What's more...based on real events.  The film depicts actual kidnapping of Freddy Heineken (the founder of Heineken beer)in Amsterdam in 1983, which fetched a record ransom sum of today's money numbered at 16 million Euros.  The  kidnapers were a group of four friends who did not have any criminal history, but were simply construction workers looking for an easy way out.  Anthony Hopkins looks physically very similar to Freddy Heineken, so I think he was casted perfectly for the role.  As for the perpetrators,  Sam Worthington and Cor von Hout (Jim Strugess)  play the master-minds behind the kidnapping...they also rock those cool 1980's leather jackets.

I recommend reading the real story of the kidnappers right after viewing this film.

7000005,3,B00T4LLJUG,"Kidnapping Freddy Heineken (Kidnapping Mr. Heineken) is a crime drama based on the real-life kidnapping of Freddy Heineken, chairman of the board of directors and CEO of the company Heineken, which happened in November, 1983. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Freddy Heineken, though his role is a rather small one. The same kidnapping was covered by a 2011 Dutch movie The Heineken Kidnapping starring Rutger Hauer as Heineken, so be careful not to confuse the two films.

So, this is a story about a group of five males in the Netherland, who, after a bad investment, decided to kidnap Alfred Freddy Heineken. The film is directed by Swedish Daniel Alfredson, responsible for two of Stieg Larsson novels The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. No, not the first one of the trilogy.

Anyway, Kidnapping Freddy Heineken starts promisingly, with one decent chase scene, but after that things get slow and dull because of the lack of the details about the crime and characters involved in it. Im fine with the films low-key approach itself (all the events are depicted from the criminals viewpoints), but I think it only makes the film duller when all we do is to wait, wait, and wait for something interesting to happen.

After waiting for long, all we get is a rather straightforward and uninteresting account of the case, and Anthony Hopkins doing what he is supposed to do. He gives much-needed energy and humor to the film, but even he cannot save the film from the dullness.",1436227200,,1524,4.809160305343512

7000009,2,B00T4LLJUG,"The trailer for ""Kidnapping Mr. Heineken""  had me me looking forward to a film that seemed interesting, and with a bit of a moral message. As we know though, trailers are devised to hook you in and often display the best scenes a film has to offer. I ended up watching those decent scenes again while viewing the entire film but they were surrounded by a rushed storyline. Although the film is ""based on a true story"",  I have a feeling that the ""based on"" statement is about as minimally derived at as possible. These average English blokes hatching a plan to capture the wealthy Mr. Heineken never really seem that financially desperate, even though at the start of a the film we are given a quick ""reason"" for their scheme , there's no crushing motivation. Outside of a few scenes, I felt the acting was very poor with a ton of ,""okay, you yell now"" parts given by the director off screen.

 What holds your interest is the outcome. Basically, ""how is the kidnapped person going to act, and when do these guys doing it get caught?"" That's the lure.  When it comes to the separate part of the film; the reaction of the kidnapped , I find that Hopkins (who is a great actor) falls back into a previous character. In this case, as Mr. Heineken , he could almost be his character from the film ""The Edge"". Rough and ready with a moral code. It's not really bad, I'm just weary of it. There is no character depth which I feel is required for a film such as this.  So, not a solidly entertaining movie experience for this film buff.",1435363200,,1529,4.385159010600707

scheme to kidnap the heir to a brewing empire 'Alfred (Freddy) Heineken' (Anthony Hopkins)
These low-level prospective kidnappers realize that to actually collect the princely sum they hoped to demand
without capture will take a lot of careful planning and surveillance, a task that will need an investment, however
they have no money, it'll mean they have to steal it.

7000032,2,B00T4LLJUG,"Having been alive back in 1982 when the actual kidnapping of Freddy Heineken took place I was surprised that I didn't remember much about it taking place. Having recently watched and written about the history of the brewery it discussed the kidnapping towards the end of that documentary. When I saw that a feature film had been made about it I had high hopes. Those were quickly dismissed as the end credits rolled on this film.

If you're not familiar with Heineken beer then youve never seen the world renowned small green bottles that it comes in. An old brewery based in Europe at first but transplanted here to the states as well, it is one of the most successful breweries in the world. Not only that but it remains, basically, a family owned company. Who better to target as a kidnapping victim then the head of the family?

Back in 1982 a group of friends are having hard times. Having begun a small construction company times are tough. To add to their problems an apartment building they purchased is causing them grief. A group of squatters has taken over the building and changed the locks and due to the way the law is written, they cant be forced out because of this. The group of friends tries to toss them out and ends up in jail for their troubles.

Unable to come up with a way to retain their business and to take care of their families they come up with the idea to kidnap someone for a huge ransom. The talk eventually comes around to a local business owner worth millions, Freddy Heineken (Anthony Hopkins). To finance the operation the group first robs a bank for funds. Barely escaping from that escapade, the kidnapping is put into play. Heineken and his chauffer are taken in front of his house and transported to a secret location while the demands are made.

If all of this sounds rather mundane the truth is it unfolds that way as well. What little excitement there is to be found in this film comes during the bank robbery and subsequent chase and both are short lived. On top of that the movie makes it difficult to feel any sympathy for those behind the kidnapping once the opening sequences are done with their arrest at the apartment house. While based on reality it feels like a long stretch to move from construction worker to bank robber/kidnapper because a loan doesnt go through. And yet thats how it appears here.

Among the kidnappers are actors Jim Sturges and Sam Worthington, both who have made much better films in the past. Why they decided to get involved with this one is beyond me. Both are accomplished actors and do their roles well here but those roles don't feel as if they offer much in the long run. Completely wasted is Hopkins as the kidnap victim. His scenes are short and sweet and offer little for him to do.

I always have a hard time steering people clear of movies that come out. I realize that there was a lot of time and effort put into any movie, even a bad one, by the cast and crew that were involved in making that film. At the same time, despite all of their efforts, when a bad movie is made I feel much better about warning people to avoid it than if I were to simply sit back and say oh yeah, good one. This movie never made me feel involved, never made me feel for the characters and moved along at a snails pace involving more bickering between the kidnappers than anything else in the story. In the end I would say pass this one by unless you feel the need to see everything ever made by the actors involved or have a love of Heineken beer. Even then you might be better off to spend it on a six pack than the cost of renting this movie.",1431043200,,3614,4.386567164179104

7000050,4,B00T4LLJUG,"Set in Amsterdam,KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN is the fascinating true story of a group of childhood friends and business partners who, in 1983, kidnapped and held for ransom billionaire beer baron Freddy Heineken and his driver.

The movie evokes memories of a 2003 cable television film, STEALING SINATRA, which dealt with the 1963 abduction of Frank Sinatra, Jr.

The difference between the two films is one of tone.  STEALING SINATRA plays the celebrity abduction as a dark comedy, whereas KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN is much more dour in its approach.

Jim Sturgess, Sam Worthington and Ryan Kwanten star in the 2015 release, cast as three of the five kidnappers who are desperately in need of cash in order to revive their failing construction business.  To finance the criminal venture, they rob an armored car, resulting in an exciting, well-staged chase through the streets and canals of Amsterdam.

The actual kidnapping of Heineken (Anthony Hopkins) goes well, but when the billionaires people delay in responding to the hostage takers demands, the conspiracy begins to slowly come apart.

Directed by Daniel Alfredson, KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN is well paced and features some robust dramatic sequences.  The problem is that, with the exception of the Heineken character, deliciously portrayed by Hopkins, none of the other characters (i.e. the kidnappers) are that likeable or, frankly, interesting.  This is not the fault of the actors, who are all excellent, but by the basic grim approach to the material taken by the director and writers.

Nevertheless, KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN is certainly worth your time.

The Blu-ray disc from Alchemy includes several deleted and extended scenes.

work casually as an extra.
This movie was great , the pacing and acting were top notch and the story moved along quite nicely with plenty of action and suspense. I'm not going to go into detail as many have done that before me here , so I'm going to assume you know the basic plot . A few reviewers who liked the beginning and lost interest about thirty minutes or so in , must have some attention disorder.
Just because it's not like your typical hollywood movie with heaps of car chases and explosions doesn't mean it's lame. I would like to point out it's A TRUE STORY so what they did with what they had to work with was excellent.
As far as the ending goes , near the conclusion it was obvious what was going to happen . So , as they do with many true stories , they stated in writing what happened to each of the five right up until their deaths . This was perfectly acceptable to me .
All in all a great film well worth a look . Give it a go . You won't be disappointed .",1427068800,12,1119,3.9078947368421053

8700220,4,B00T4LLJUG,"Kidnapping Mr Heineken wasn't a bad movie, it certainly wasn't boring as some reviewers have claimed.  It does have its faults, some things aren't shown (explained) to the viewer and just happen, which I'll get to after a spoiler alert later on in this review, but overall it's a pretty good kidnapping movie, nothing over the top happens from the point of the kidnapped person's abilities, so it seemed a lot more realistic.  It is of course based on a true story.  I had no knowledge whatsoever of any part of the true story before putting the DVD in my player, so for me every part of the plot was fresh, I had no idea if they would get away with it or not, if the kidnap victims lived or died.  But saying that the film at times was very predictable, you could see things coming a long way before the characters for some reason do, such as what happens when they ask for a loan, why someone is throwing up, what happens with the squatters, the photocopier was an obvious you can see coming a mile away.  I also wondered for a while if these guys were supposed to be Amsterdam locals (as in Dutch) or Australians (mostly Australian actors play the gang members), English or American ex pats or they're on tourist visas or whatever, since they were all speaking English and basically acting like Australians do in social, especially drinking situations.  Turns out they're supposed to be Dutch locals.

The basic premise of Kidnapping Mr Heineken is a group of middle aged guys own a company that hasn't fared well in the 80's recession.  They need a loan badly to keep from bankruptcy, and their disused at the moment factory/office whatever it is has been taken over by squatters.  Ridiculously the law is on the squatters side since they changed the locks.  So the men, some who state there is no way they will ever work a day in a proper job, decide they need to get some cash quick.  Their solution as you would have guessed from the title of the film, is to kidnap a rich local businessman and ask for a huge ransom for his safe return.  But these are not the smartest guys in the world, especially when things don't go as they plan, and especially when the factor of stress is added.

Spoilers - But to do the kidnapping so they get away with it they know they need capital.  So they decide to rob a bank. Surely this would be harder to achieve you'd think than kidnapping someone, but that's what they do.  Then you've got to ask the question, since the whole point of kidnapping is to get cash, why they still needed to kidnap anyone after that.  This is one thing that is never explained in the movie. More significant spoilers - We also have no idea why the police suddenly suspect them, they just start following them in a car at one stage (although we're not sure if they are real cops, Heineken's men or whoever) and then suddenly police in actual police cars arresting Qwanten's character.  Some of the gang speculate, was it the photocopier, was it Chinese food, but these seem a pretty big stretch for an explanation with what we saw played out.  You'd think with once the police turn up if they wanted that to be a surprise for the viewer we could have had a flashback scene or something, such as at the photocopier after they leave, a phone call, ""Yes Sergeant whoever, someone did come and remove the letter from the photocopier, yeah I've just checked it definitely is not in the bin or anywhere else.""  Or perhaps there was a tracking device in with the money.  Anything would have worked without you watching going, ""but how do the police know they kidnapped them"".  In a text box at the end of the film it mentions there was an anonymous phone call but that's too little information and way to late in the film to introduce that anyway.

But overall it wasn't a bad film.  There's a few car chase scenes, which I'm guessing had a fair bit of artistic licence over the real story used.  No it wasn't a non stop action film, I'm sure in reality Mr Heineken wouldn't have been as calm the whole time as Anthony Hopkins plays him, but the movie is only based on a true story after all.",1503100800,,4107,4.423638778220451
