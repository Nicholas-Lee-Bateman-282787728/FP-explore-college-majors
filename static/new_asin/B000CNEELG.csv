8099617,5,B000CNEELG,Great 30 minute workout for when you are pressed for time.,1490313600,,58,4.363636363636363
8099618,5,B000CNEELG,"Great Pilates workout.  The pace is fast enough to get the heart rate up slightly depending upon level of fitness, age, health, etc.  I like it!",1456099200,,144,4.5
8099619,2,B000CNEELG,"I found the instructor annoying. She just stayed there and kept instructing the other 2 people on the video  which I found
very offputting..",1371859200,,140,4.833333333333333
8099620,4,B000CNEELG,"Not a tough enough workout.  If it was longer, it would be better.  I do it in combination with other DVDs.",1370390400,,107,4.0476190476190474
8099621,5,B000CNEELG,"I LOVE the Stott Pilates exercises, and especially love it when they feature Jen.  She is so graceful and athletic.  I hope that watching her technique helps me emulate her!",1343088000,,173,4.733333333333333
8099622,1,B000CNEELG,"The DVD is only 31 minutes long, and the first 4 1/2 minutes are breathing ""exercises"".  The DVD is not fast paced or ""power paced"" by any definition.  The music is horribly relaxing.  I had to turn on some other music in order to feel motivated to work out;  the music on the DVD is for relaxation.  The exercises are not strenous.  But most of all, there are glaring omissions in the exercises you can do with the circle.  There are so many other ways the circle can be used that are not on this DVD.

This DVD states that there is a bonus workout to ""take it to the next level"".  Well it is actually an advertisement for another DVD.  The short routine does not use the fitness circle at all.  It uses small balls (that you would have to purchase).  Then it ends with a picture of the Stott DVD they are trying to sell.

I recommend ""Pilates Complete for Everyone"" by bodywisdom media.  Even though the fitness circle is only a small part of the workout(s), I feel I get more results for my time spent working out.

I can't see myself ever doing the ""Power Paced Fitness Circle"" again, unless I was very sick or injured.  Like most people, I don't have unlimited time to work out.  I need every minute to count toward results. This DVD was a huge disappointment.",1267660800,6,1265,4.314893617021276
8099623,5,B000CNEELG,"Moira is the best fitness instructer; very soft spoken, and tells you how to do every move, as well as when to breathe in and out.  She targets all parts of your body, arms, back, legs, inner thights, outer thighs, abs, and chest muscles.  If you don't already have a Magic Circle, I would get the 14 inch for greater resistence.  The circle adds just the right amount of resistence.  I would like to get the Amazing Tone DVD next, with the little weight balls.  Since I've been exercising for most of my life, I will buy the 3 pound balls instead of the 2 pound.",1229817600,6,563,4.273584905660377
