8387028,5,B0031KQGH2,"""Tv Classic Detectives vol 4""  5 shows on 1 dvd with a clear picture and good sound quality.

""Richard Diamond""  with  David Janssen  1959

""Peter Gunn""  1959

""Meet McGraw"" 1958 {The adventures of McGraw brought to you by ""New Tide with reserve cleaning Power}

""Tightrope""  1960  Mike Connors with a small pistol in a holster located at the small of his back.

""Dangerous Assignment""  1952  Brian Donlevy

All 5 have original theme music and there is an extra of a list giving each shows history
with the theme music of each playing as you read .. now to me at least that is one great extra.

There was some further information of further releases including ""77 Sunset Strip""
I would wish that to be true, I did purchase a VHF of that series with 2 episodes
which I have converted to DVD.
One annoying thing concerning ""Meet McGraw"" was a constant logo ""Tv Tecs"" all through the episode on the lower right, letters in white with a dark black retangular background so it was very visable.
Even with that blemish I highly reccommend this DVD.",1354060800,,1042,4.551351351351351
