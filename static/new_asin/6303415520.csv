645150,4,6303415520,Good movie but not for everyone. Warning this movie contains mullets. This movie was released in 1995 but looked like something from the mid 1980s.,1436313600,,147,4.92
645151,1,6303415520,I could not even get more then 10 min into the movie. The filming was so poor it was grainy and the sound was very bad. I love B movies but sometimes a movie is just to poor of quality to watch. I really like swords and things like that and this was so poorly shot that I could not even stand to look at it.,1435190400,5,307,3.6666666666666665

645153,1,6303415520,"Robert Chapin, who gave us so much good action in ""Ring of Steel"", does nothing to advance his career here. This is a lamely written, poorly directed, overall amateur-feeling video.
The plot involves a post-apocalyptic swordfighter going back to our time to save the future from some plague, or something. There's something in there about how he rebelled against the warlord who created him, there's the requisite romantic interests and bad guys and stranger-in-a-strange-land type stuff as our heroes and villains explore 1990's LA.
The sets in the future are obviously someone's back yard. The fight choreography is blatant and poorly edited. The acting ranges from almost competent to woeful, and is not helped by the weak material. The director himself plays a guy about to enjoy his wedding night when the female hero from the future, inexplicably topless, appears in his bed. This level of sophistication infuses the whole production. A decent student film festival will give you more cinematic satisfaction.
The only reedeeming qualities I found in this fim are the eye-candy actors and the ability to clearly analyze the sword fighting choreography.",970704000,3,1157,5.2594594594594595

645428,1,6303415520,"I noticed the bad reviews, watched some since it was free with Prime. This is an amateur attempt at the basics of a mainstream movie but it is essentially a home movie made with one video tape camera often ""filmed"" at someone's backyard or basement, with other scenes in public areas like alleys or parking lots. There are some scenes in an empty hospital. Story sort of resembles 12 Monkeys combined with Terminator movies, with some attempts to add martial art film fighting. The only money spent was on hiring the cast, a few ""B"" movie actors and some fit extras.

There is nothing fun here at all, dull camera work, it is not really even unintentionally funny. Has no gore even with the violence, has boring dialogue, and it makes almost no attempt to be funny. The most creative thing is the cover picture. The director, who also is credited with writing and producing, and has a ""special appearance"" acting in the movie, has managed to imitate the lowest level of mediocrity, with no apparent aspirations beyond that other than to go through the motions of a basic movie.

What is interesting here is that this director/filmmaker has no real intention of making a good or entertaining movie, just a low cost basic product. I believe the point was to cynically make the cheapest generic movie that could still be sold to the video rental market. The people who paid to rent at Blockbuster must have been really annoyed.",1453680000,,1424,4.692
645429,1,6303415520,I figured it was going to be bad but was in the mood for a lil cheese 90s movie but this was terrible.

645640,2,6303415520,"After making his acting debut in the very cool&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Steel/dp/B00004TITL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Steel</a>, swordsman Robert Chapin followed it up with this little independent disaster. Dragon Fury is an ambitious outing that partially recycles the premise of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;with swords in place of robots and without a hint of a substantial budget. Though it bears the Troma label, this is likely a third-party acquisition because despite its hokeyness, it lacks the inspired cult spirit of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Toxic-Avenger/dp/B00JOSOIVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Toxic Avenger</a>. Not to spoil the rest of the review, but this movie isn't very good.

The story: A warrior from a dystopian future (Chapin) and his cohort (Chona Jason,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shira-The-Vampire-Samurai/dp/B000VIC8WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shira: The Vampire Samurai</a>) travel back in time to 1999 and attempt to recover the cure for a devastating disease. All the while, they're hunted by the minions of an evil overlord (Richard Lynch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master-III-Toulon-s-Revenge/dp/B008NNSE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge</a>).

From the opening shots of a mass slaughter taking place on a flimsy outdoor set, the viewer knows they're in for the amateur experience. Things improve a little when the characters travel through time and have the public property of Los Angeles to elevate production standards, but the single-camera cinematography and restrictive indoor locations never let you forget what kind of a movie you're watching. The tone of this production is inconsistent and inharmonious: for the most part, the performers are trying to tell a semi-serious action yarn, but there are instances where it seems like a rogue goofball took over direction with intentionally bad comedic scenes and silly inserts. I don't know what to make of this, but I'm unimpressed.

Though Richard Lynch gets top billing, the real villain of the piece is T.J. Storm (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Cobra/dp/B007IEDK1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Cobra</a>), given his presence and genuine athletic ability. Though the fight scenes that he contributes to are plagued by occasionally silly choreography and repetitiveness, Storm and Chapin and a handful of costars are fun to watch. Their sword-fighting is a welcome change from kickboxing, at the very least. The fights are virtually the only reason one would want to watch this movie, but even I cant get maximum enjoyment out of the duels due to the underutilization of Chona Jason and the embarrassing finale between Chapin and Lynch.

Dragon Fury has enough spirit and enthusiasm to save it from a lower rating, but its still a cheap movie that can hardly afford its own special effects. A handful of blatant goofs don't help (get a load of T.J. Storms white stunt double). I don't think its funny enough to achieve cult status, rendering it as little more than a cheap action movie that failed to maximize its resources. Let it be.",1445990400,,3478,6.620614035087719
645641,1,6303415520,"Not sure the origin of the problem, but like some other reviewers, for me the film was unviewable.
