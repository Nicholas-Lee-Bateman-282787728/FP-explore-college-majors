8707347,1,B00ULQ0PZI,"I could not believe my eyes or my ears.  A horrid set, with a mesmerizing ""black hole' in the middle that unfortunately never swallowed the entire production, light changes that made no sense--imagine a blue stage suddenly bathed by pea soup green.  As to the singers, luckily, i found a review by Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Irurzun. ""Maria di Rohan at the Bergamo Festival"", that says it all: ""This opera works well with extraordinary voices, but in Bergamo we had none and the result left much to be desired"".  The only voice of any heft and power belonged to the baritone Marco di Felice.  As for the others, I'll be charitable and keep silent [which they should have also done].  I do not agree with those who say this was another Donizetti masterpiece, It is not, and Camarano's libretto is probably his worst as well.  He reduced the story of a lascivious but interesting schemer (who by the way, lived in pomp and circumstance int a ripe old age) into the fiction of a repentant and quite boring adulteress.  If you do not have the means to do justice to an opera, please do not stage it!  One plus: the technical presentation was really outstanding, particularly the decision to provide a historical introduction and plot summary as the overture played.  However, it made the farrago onstage feel even more incomprehensible.",1456790400,,1330,4.798245614035087
8707348,4,B00ULQ0PZI,"This is late Donizetti, which means that it eschews some (but not all) of opera formulas (cavatina, tempo di mezzo, cabaletta) of the big arias. There is more diversity of form here which works to enhance the melodramatic story.

All three leads are very good, with special kudos to Marco di Felice as Enrico (husband). The set is a little strange (off kilter and surrealistic), but the performance is straightforward.

As with all Bongiovanni dvd's, the video is only fair (but better than the others I have seen), and the sound is stereo only. However, the sound is quite clear (I like body mikes), and, for the most part, well balanced with the orchestra.

As usual with these dvd's there are no production extras, but a detailed on screen plot summary during the overture is pretty detailed. Also, the booklet is more informative than we usually get from this company. Oh, and the subtitles are very well done- no cringe-worthy translations.

Overall, this is very good for this company- AND there is no other officially released video of this opera. If you like Donizetti operas, this is a must have.",1443830400,3,1105,4.8
8707349,5,B00ULQ0PZI,"Maria di Rohan (1843) is Donizetti's last ""melodrammi"" opera before his tabes death in 1848. (one more opera-comic also aired in 1843). Maria is in advanced form as a more ""through"" composed composition and less of the classic Italian ""numbers"" work with set arias and recitatives. And the drama is ""high"" drama from Maria's first act ""Cupa fatal mestizia...."", then the dramatic end of the act with the supposed fall of Cardinal Richelieu, and then the truly exciting and beautiful grand finale of Act 2 duet between Maria and her lover Count Riccardo to the final of act three when her husband the Duke  Enrico curses her to ""vivo non t'e concesso""  a life of remorse after her lover shoots himself to death. Things are hot and heavy in this fast paced action piece. The part of Maria is very well developed in the opera and is well served by Majella Cullagh vocally - though she is not a born actress. Her husband Enrico di Chevreuse, the Duke, is a very well written baritone part and it is done with great artistry by Marco di Felice. Her lover Riccardo, Conte di Chalais is a fine tenor role and shows off the lyric voice of Salvatore Cordella. There is so much fine music here that all the leads as well as the chorus and orchestra can show off their artistry to great acclaim. This includes the conductor, former tenor, Gregory Kunde who kept a tight rein of the orchestra. As many times as I've played this disc I'm still thrilled by the intensity of the opera as a whole and the final curse of the wronged Duke on his innocent wife Maria. It's a great show!
The production is inoffensive modernist tight budget with a few sillinesses but it serves. The women all get one costume for all three acts. The men at least get to wear their shirt out of they've been wounded in a duel of which there are many. But the ladies including Maria get only one sweaty velvet gown for the whole show.
The setting is 1620s France during the reign of Louis XIII with Cardinal Richelieu as Prime Minister . Before act 1 opens Duke Enrico di Chevreuse, Maria's secret husband has killed the Cardinal's nephew in a duel. Curtain up..............
The score used here is that used at the opera's premier 5 June 1843 at the Karntnertortheater, Vienna.. Later that year Donizetti revised it for Paris and then revised it for Naples etc etc. Fortunately the Donizetti Festival in Bergamo used the original Vienna version.  and that is what is on this recording.
Maria di Rohan was a real person in history and judging by her portrait was quite a handsome women. She is also mentioned in the Three Musketeers.",1440720000,,2593,4.572043010752688

8707351,4,B00ULQ0PZI,"Maria di Rohan was Donizetti's third to the last operas; it is full of dramatic situations and possesses an excellent score. There are two CD recordings of the work: one is so-so from Opera Rara; the second is quite good from Nightingale Classics, with Edita Gruberova.

It needed a better DVD than this one, but since it is rarely performed, this is likely to be the only DVD for some time.

There are some strengths, though. Majella Cullagh does quite well in the title role, and baritone Marco di Felice does well with the part of Maria's husband, Enrico. Tenor Salvatore Cordella is barely marginal as the old boyfriend re-emerging in Maria's time of need, with a voice that is reedy, and occasionally strained in the top notes.

Staging is traditional and tenor-turned-conductor Grgory Kunde does quite a nice job from the pit.

Technically, the disc is a mixed bag. Why in the age of Blu ray and HD MA audio Bongiovanni continues to issue straight DVDs with stereo only sound is beyond me, especially since they are issuing rare Donizetti works that are unlikely to see another edition. Here, the picture varies in crispness and color, with noticeable blurring and some color washout. One will play with the volume control to get even sound, because levels fluctuate.

Nonetheless, it IS essential Donizetti for lovers of the composer and/or Bel Canto, so it gets the extra star for that reason.

I just wish that Bongiovanni had given more attention to the technical aspects of this recording, and cast a better tenor.

Oh, well ...",1434758400,4,1539,4.806818181818182
8707352,5,B00ULQ0PZI,"Maria di Rohan has a beautiful haunting melody of 4 chords in the overture and especially in the scene between the tenor and soprano. The opera is one of Donizetti later opera set in Paris, at the time of Cardinal Richelieu. The sets are somewhat surrealistic, representing Louvre. The costume are beautiful and represent the period very well. The singers were very good, especially the baritone part of Maria's husband. I was surprised to see Jeffery Kunde conducting. instead of singing. He did a great job. Overall, this was a very good performance of an opera that is rarely performed. The subtitles are English, Italian, and Japanese only. The only annoying thing was the use of plastic in the sets to create a vortex, which I suppose represented the forces drawing the characters to the tragic death of Maria's boyfriend before her marriage arranged by her mother. The story as usual does not match history completely, but does represent the period and culture of Paris. I watched the opera once and will enjoy seeing it again to catch all of the subtleties of the opera.",1434326400,7,1077,4.827027027027027
8707353,4,B00ULQ0PZI,"This recording was taken in October 2011 at the Bergamo Music Festival and is of the original Vienna version. It is the first commercially available video.
I have heard several of the audio recordings over the years, which each have their strengths. During the overture there is a synopsis by act in Italian and English on the screen, a nice feature with an unfamiliar story.

This orchestra is subtly conducted by Gregory Kunde, another tenor who has taken to the baton and is well recorded.
The sound is stereo, which is spacious and well balanced, and for anyone with a 5.1 system, your receiver can easily synthesize surround channels.
The singers are primarily heard through body mics which I don't find enhancing, emphasizing the core voice off the vocal cords. These are larger voices that benefit from a supportive resonant environment to fill in overtones, and especially in a romantic bel canto opera, more ""glow"" around the voices and the visuals is beneficial.

If this was a bootleg recording, it would be highly sought after. This would have benefitted by additional post-production to re-equalize the audio and video.
As far as the audio, switching in ""loudness"" and shaving a bit off the treble was helpful. The video was a bit too saturated and grainy on a high-res 4k TV. On a regular TV most of that was not noticeable.

It takes a while in Act 1 for the opera to take off, Act 2 is short but very engaging, Act 3 starts with Maria's big aria ""Havvi un Dio"" and the rest of the Act is strong.
The staging is the undistracting, the costumes are period, and the acting is generic. Donizetti operas are about the music.
Maria di Rohan is set in the court of Louis XIII, where she is involved in some court intrigues, and with a secret husband and an admirer, and the offstage presence of Richelieu.
Maria would have been a great role role for Moffo, Caballe or Sills, who would have been a bit more charming and sweeter than Cullough here.

This is a welcome entry from Donizetti to which I will return. As he later modified the score for Paris, someday we may see that version in a fully polished production.
Meanwhile, I'm grateful for this version.",1434240000,10,2167,4.650130548302872
