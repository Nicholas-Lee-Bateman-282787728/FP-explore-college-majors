7936308,5,B00005B20P,"This was the completeling DVD I needed to get a complete set of all 95 episode of Rurouni Kenshin. Please enjoy my review

This disk contains episode 36 to 39 in the Rurouni Kenshin series.

The story continues with Kenshin Himura where he fights inside the base of Shishio and fights his way to get to his biggest threat.

Pros: it is english DUBBED and can be SUBBED if wish.

Cons: make sure the disk works because I had to order it twice because the first two disks were defected so this one I bought worked perfectly and I was happy ever since!

Overall: it is near impossble to get the complete Rurouni Kenshin series anymore for a reasonable price. So if you must buy each disk sepretally so you can get it that way, unless you feel like paying $200 to $500 for the complete set.",1430524800,,786,4.319727891156463

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353110400,,1385,4.839662447257384
7936310,5,B00005B20P,"This is the third DVD of the second of third saga. It starts out with Saito and Kenshin entering Shishio's mansion and then Kenshin fights Senkaku, of course defeating him, then Sojiro, which in the process, Kenshin's reverse-blade sword is cut in half, which leaves Kenshin no choice but to hunt down the creator of it so he can continue his fight with Shishio and the Jupogottona. I don't want to spoil anything else, but this is one must-get DVD. Enjoy!!!!!",1067904000,2,460,4.691358024691358

7936312,5,B00005B20P,"This is yet another humorous/exciting Rurouni Kenshin, there really isn't much to say without spoilers, the biggest thing that happens here is the Sakubatou gets broken and Kenshin needs a new sword for most of the whole DVD, the rest of the time is spent introducing us to the rest of the Oniwabanshu (very comedic) and Kenshin attempting to find the maker of the sakubatou.....too bad I can't say anymore, buy it and find out for yourself!",1033344000,2,441,4.740259740259741
7936313,5,B00005B20P,"I loved every episode of this tape. From the battle against Senkaku, the confrontation of Sojirou Seta (by the way, Sojirou was never part of the Shinsengumi, that reviewer was probebly thinking of Okita Soshi, who looks a lot like Sojirou), Sanosuke's special training, and meeting one of of the Juppongatana, Chou the sword hunter. This volume kept me interested through till the very end. If you've been following the series so far, this volume will not dissapoint.",1001376000,3,468,5.012820512820513
7936314,5,B00005B20P,"While they're not the BEST episodes in Kenshin they leave a lot to be said and a lot of questions to be asked.  'specially after the last episode on the DVD itself.  Not only that but there's a new opening theme song which is just as, if not better then Freckles!  Don't believe me?  Download the song yourself! (it's called ""Half"")  Also the new ending theme song, 4th Avenue Caf plays too.  ANYway it's a lot more serious Kenshin then goof Kenshin.  Which isn't nessecarialy a bad thing, it's just different.  'specially when he says to Misao ""I really don't care whether you like me that way or not Misao dono""  Also... thought you knew everything there is to know about Saitoh?  Well guess again! ^^x",998352000,,704,4.515873015873016
7936315,4,B00005B20P,This DVD is were Kenshin confronts his past... well frankly he has done that the whole Seris it would seem but he is dealing with Masto and that Assassain who cant do anything but smile which he has a very good reason ^^  Kenshin is Great anime and this DVD is a among the best of the show.,998006400,,290,4.0
7936316,5,B00005B20P,"This DVD contains some of the best episodes, because this DVD doesn't have any filler episodes. It's all important and develops the story deeper than ever. The Kenshin series is my favorite and no true anime fan should miss out on this. True, some may be turned off and mislead by just seeing the first episodes of the series, due to its lack of 'seriousness' and incredible 'goofiness,' but it's definately gets better as the episodes go by. Don't forget to get the first DVDs too (Some of the first DVDs have filler episodes but its good all around).",985392000,6,552,4.585858585858586
