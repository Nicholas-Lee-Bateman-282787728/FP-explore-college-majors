8528875,2,B008LY8XH4,"The FBI-Jerry Lynn/Chris Chetti tag team match was perfectly fine even though the ending felt like a bit rushed. The Masato Tanaka-Doug Furnas match was a terrible FMW showcase. The Rob Van Dam-2 Cold Scorpio match was very slow and failed to become an epic bout. The Dudley Boys-Hardcore Chair Swinging Freaks-New Jack/Spike Dudley 3 way tag team match was not great but pretty good. The Tommy Dreamer-Justin Credible match was mediocre at best. The TV title match between Taz & Bam Bam Bigelow was so-so with a good & memorable finish to save it. The Dueling Canes match between Sabu & The Sandman was goof-free,perfectly fine and a cool finish to boot. The Closing tag team match between Al Snow & Lance Storm against Shane Douglas & Chris Candido was short,bad and forgettable. I give this PPV a 3 out of 10.",1373068800,,812,4.685314685314685

Living Dangerously '98 took place in Asbury Park, NJ which is the hometown of Bam Bam Bigelow who faced off against Television Champion Taz in what originally started as a challenge from Taz to Bigelow but got more personal when Bigelow turned on him to re-join the Triple Threat in a brawl that went all over the place from the ring to throughout the crowd that's mostly remembered for one of the most memorable moments in ECW history.  Justin Credible was looking to make himself a main event player at the expense of Tommy Dreamer while also attempting to steal Beulah away from him in match that saw Dreamer not only battle Credible but his entire group as well while Justin also had to deal with a figure from his past.  Other matches include Lance Storm & Al Snow vs. Shane Douglas & Chris Candido, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Spike Dudley & New Jack which was the first time we saw New Jack dive off the balcony of the building on PPV, 2 Cold Scorpio returning vs. Rob Van Dam in a very athletic match, Sandman vs. Sabu in a Dueling Canes match, Masato Tanaka vs. Doug Furnas, and Jerry Lynn & Chris Cherri vs. F.B.I.

This was a fun show overall with each match being entertaining in it's own right with the only thing negative I can say is the main event tag match being more of an angle than actual match itself but overall still a good overall event from ECW that's worth checking out.",1369353600,,1695,4.405750798722044
