8138871,5,B000HDR8CI,"While many of you may not care for these ""compilation DVDs, please take into account the fact that the Johto season dvds have been out of print for years and can go for hundreds. Other than hunting down for them online, some of these DVDs give some as a ""best of"" set, so it's a start for any legit collector unless you're like a millionaire or something.

Anywho, this particular DVD of the All-Stars series has the most long-awaited battle of the entire original series, The Ties the Bind and Can't Beat the Heat! I'm talkin' Ash Ketchum Vs. Gary Oak in the Johto League Silver Conference! This legendary and historic battle is more than enough reason to get this disc by itself, for any true hardcore fan this battle is considered of the greatest moments in Pokmon history!",1399680000,2,776,4.58273381294964
