Many thanks to my online horror buddy, Zane, for sharing this bad 80s masterpiece with me.  Zane is a true 80s horror aficionado and even took part in making an 80s style horror film: The Barn.  So that's my ""thank you"" plug for Zane and his movie.  On with the review!

Also released as Invasion of the Body Suckers [no clue where that title came from] and Insect [vague, but appropriate], I love that this movie gets straight to business.  After being pricked by a strange exotic plant and passing out, an old man is rushed to the hospital only to have a large white worm emerge from his mouth resulting in his death!  The worm parasite quickly gets the entire hospital quarantined when numerous patients begin to show strange symptoms after the arrival of this ""insect.""

Some playful young patients come across the specimen and unknowingly feed it a ""nucleic acid promoter"" that augments growth and hormonal activityso presumably we'll have a giant mutant bug in no time.  Yaaaay!!!!

Director William Fruet (Goosebumps, War of the Worlds) has made his filmmaking intentions obvious as Ranger Rick meets slimy science fiction in this feisty Aliens (1986) rip-off in which we emulate the infection scene (in the greenhouse with the plant), chestburster scene, the queen alien egg-laying scene complete with flashing blue background lighting, kids and monsters in ventilation shafts like Newt, and slimy secretions galore from a giant insectoid creature that grows at an alarming pace.  They even reproduce the scene in which the queen xenomorph is infuriated by lighting her egg chamber and offspring on fire.

Our biological updates about the praying mantis monster are delivered by the local entomologist (Don Lake; Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Short Circuit 2) and non-scientific exposition comes courtesy of the hospital administrator (John Vernon; Killer Klowns from Outer Space, The Uncanny)--both roles being much appreciated by this 80s horror fan.

There's plenty of goofy rubber monster suit action in this fun 80s creature feature.  We see a lot of our monster and like Peter Pan across the Broadway stage it swings from the ceiling.  It's laughably awesome and there are a few scenes of festive gore.

The film ended with a typically campy twist that left a smile on my face.  There was even an implication that two intoxicated patients were spared because of their inebriation--much like Grabbers (2012).",1463270400,,2421,5.070707070707071

It features some cool special effects and believable performances. However, it ends in a whimper as the root of the infection turns out to be an overgrown insect now hiding in the back of the hospital and, from there, a very predictable ending. This is a $5 Wal-Mart bin feature. I have seen it for about $20, and don't even think that it's worth that. When someone offers it at about $10, I'll probably pick it up. I don't believe that this movie has ever been transfered professionally, and suspect that this copy, no matter how well-done, is homemade. In any event, I am certain that anyone paying $200 for this disc will be very, very disappointed.",1379894400,,846,4.722972972972973

Which would be a crummy low budget sci fi b movie about bugs going on a killing spree in a hospital. A pretty strange decapitation scene,maggots, and drunk old ladies are enough to get your attention. Let me go into some detail

""if you don't want to be spoiled please don't read any further and just go buy the movie!""

First off we have some old guy who pricks his hand on some exotic plant at the beginning of the movie. (there's really no plot here and this stuff just happens lol) Then after that it really takes off. (no dead airtime here) man gets sick, gets rushed to hospital and then when he arrives he pukes up a big maggot. (why this is happening we don't really know) but ok ill live with it.

Then the unthinkable happens! (yea right) lol

Big maggot gets some chemicals on it, grows and matures into what looks like a big pray mantis and goes on a hospital killing spree. People fight back but are getting sick from the contaminated man. Some old ladies get drunk, they realize alcohol is a remedy for this sickness. Blow the bugs up with some hospital ray guns and we have a happy ending.

Overall the acting isn't too bad and neither are the effects so i give this movie 4 stars considering what it is. It keeps ya entertained and i had a good time watching it with my brother in law. We laughed alot through this thing, and all in all its a good sci fi b movie from the 80s. (hard to find and def falls through the cracks). The monster looks pretty fake at the end when its getting pulled around in the sky with a rope (ur not supposed to know that its a rope)  its supposed to be flying!"" but clearly looks like a bug puppet being yanked around with a rope lol. Not a bad flick overall and i highly reccomend it if u like these kind of movies.",1337644800,,1858,4.161559888579387
