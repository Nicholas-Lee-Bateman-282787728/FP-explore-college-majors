2865099,5,B000REWZ1Q,"Although the fighting in the Aleutian Islands ultimately proved to be a sideshow in the war in the Pacific, ""Report from the Aleutians"" offers dramatic and compelling visual testimony of how difficult air operations in the islands southwest of Alaska were.  The film, produced by Hollywood great John Huston, set the geographic stage (lots of ice, wind, and rain!), and it demonstrated the difficulty of supplying operations from the island chain.  The viewer first joins the planning for a bombing mission against the Japanese garrison at Kiska and then flies the mission with the crew.  There are good operational scenes of B-24s, B-17s, P-39s, and P-38s -- and the takeoffs from PSP runways covered by inches of water are especially dramatic.  As is common with many of the wartime documentaries, there are interesting sequences to show inter-service cooperation and the work of all the maintainers, bomb loaders, and other supporters including the Chaplain.  There's even music -- a group of airmen singing the old service song borrowed from the Royal Air Force, ""I've Got Sixpence.""  Yes, this is a film well worth watching.

The color film is beautiful and the bombing run over the island of Kiska is among the most dramatic you will see in a documentary about the war.  And while it is clearly a one-sided piece of propaganda designed to boost morale back home, even that is interesting in its own way.  Also, footage from his film pops up in just about every Aleutian Island documentary you will see, most recently the PBS film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-White-Black-Blue/dp/B000X0GNYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red White Black & Blue</a>&nbsp;and The History Channel's ""Bloody Aleutians,"" which isn't on Amazon for some reason...",1202688000,3,746,6.018867924528302
8200231,2,B000REWZ1Q,I imagine I should have expected no more than a piece that could be shown to the mom's and dads of the period.  Apart from the weather it did not show much of the battle for Kiska and Attu which is what I had hoped to see .,1492646400,,223,3.6458333333333335

8200233,5,B000REWZ1Q,"Very interesting! Having spent a year on that rock, I was totally mesmerized by the show. I can certainly identify with some of the aspects of life on Adak . My time was spent during the COLD WAR. Get it? Adak is some sort of incorporated city now.

8200234,5,B000REWZ1Q,"About to watch this film but again note the language used in these Amazon reviews. The term propaganda is thrown around a lot in these reviews of military films and documentaries on Amazon.
Propaganda? How about presentation, exploration, demonstration, experience, description?
Are we engaging in 'propaganda' in our analysis regarding Islamic terrorism? Or ISIS?
Must everyone 'feel good', including those who want to kill us, for something to have meaning?
While position, stance and perspective is of value, a factor to be considered, important, can nothing ever be found to be wrong?
If the Nazi's had prevailed in Europe, or perhaps even beyond, what might our world look like?
Now I'll watch this film, learn about the war against the Japanese in the Northern Pacific, and think about how cold it must have been dying in the Bering Sea, how lonely and heartbreaking it must have been to be flying back from a run having completed your mission knowing you don't have enough gas to get back and falling into the sea in the middle of nowhere in the Pacific never to be seen or heard from again, or you and your parachute a flaming fireball as you desperately try to exit a burning, diving falling plane.",1427414400,,1207,4.835748792270532
8200235,4,B000REWZ1Q,Of interest because my father was there during the war.  I've read about the operation and typical conditions.  The footage wasn't representative of usual reality so it gives a false sense that it was better than it really was.,1400198400,,227,4.794871794871795
8200236,1,B000REWZ1Q,An old documentary.  I liked it except the movie stopped streaming about fifteen minutes into the flick.  I'd like to watch in it entirety sometime when I have time.,1396396800,,165,4.655172413793103

8200238,4,B000REWZ1Q,I enjoyed watching this DVD. It was a bit slow but it'a fairly good history lesson about the war in our own back yard. This is why The Alaska Highway was built. It was oh so close to Canada to.,1363824000,,193,3.85
8200239,1,B000REWZ1Q,"I was expecting a real documentary, hoping for some information for a book I am writing. It's set in the Aleutians during World War II and I was looking for geographical footage of Attu that would give me a better sense of the island. This was not that at all and it didn't help that the sound quality was so poor I had trouble understanding three words out of a dozen. Nor do I really understand why the other features were included. The Aleutian war was not a carrier war and jet technology was in the developmental stage. What did give me a good sense of how the war was up to and during the battle of Attu island was Brian Garfield's Thousand Mile War, an historical account that reads like a novel. (See my separate review for this.)

However, for what it was, Signal Corp propaganda to bolster morale back home, the editing and footage in Report From The Aleutians was well done. That it ignored 1) the Aleutian stare and the many other cases of mental illness that the truly horrible living conditions fostered in our troops, 2) such historical facts as our men not being issued cold weather clothing or boots, and 3) the extreme problems in communication that led to a number of rather tragic blunders, is something to be expected in a wartime production. What is sad about this is that measured against the truth of what our troops faced, their accomplishments were truly heroic.",1286582400,,1388,4.552
8200240,5,B000REWZ1Q,"I really appreciated getting this DVD which is superior to the videos I had purchased previously.  It was clear, and in perfect condition.  I was interested especially in this news item, because my father headed Bomber Command in the Aleutian theatre prior to his service in the Pacific.  I would like to purchase other copies, if possible, for my children. Thank you.",1245715200,3,368,4.903225806451613
