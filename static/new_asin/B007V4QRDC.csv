5111244,4,B007V4QRDC,"My ten month old was acting alittle crazy at bed time and i flipped on the TV. They were selling classic country CDs and i noticed the little guy calmed down and was mesmerized by the singers. I searched and found this video of 70/80's classics. I knew all but a couple and could sing along which my little man enjoyed and was able to put him right to sleep.

5111277,4,B007V4QRDC,"Legends is perhaps a mild overstatement. Good basic old time performances in an intimate venue. Maybe not all 'legends' in everyone's book, some lesser knowns that it was good to hear again, some 'legends' in their earlier days. Well worth watching if you're interested in the nooks and crannies of country music.",1439596800,,313,5.038461538461538

5111290,5,B007V4QRDC,"This DVD is similar to the DVD 20 First Ladies of Country Music that I reviewed last week, only this time there are 14 male singers or groups and six females  some are on the other DVD.

This 57 minute DVD consists of performances recorded at the Cheyenne Saloon at the Church Street Station entertainment complex in Orlando Florida during the 1980s for a cable TV show.  The title pretty accurate. Only one performer here  Razzy Brown  can probably not be considered a legend.  And Johnny Tillotson  is not exactly country but performs his early 1960s hit Let It Be Me.  But seeing a young Bobby Bare, and George Jones, Hoyt Axton, Faron Young, Merle Haggard are just fine with me.

Its sort of a time capsule of that period when you see how  many of these women have the big frizzy hairdos of the period. Lynn Andersons isn't frizzy but her hair style sure is strange!

Some  don't sing their big hits. Tammy Wynette sings Woman Hood, not Stand By Your Man. Its the same performance on the First Ladies DVD but Jeannie C. Riley (Listed here as Jean C. Rile  does her Harper Valley PTA hit and Tanya Tucker does Delta Dawn

The sound is decent. Because this was before wide screen TVs the screen ratio aspect is the standard 4:3.
Based on the reviews here this was first released on DVD in 2006 but it is being released again in 2014 by Music Video Distributors.

For the list price its good value for anyone who remembers the country stars of the 1980s.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
