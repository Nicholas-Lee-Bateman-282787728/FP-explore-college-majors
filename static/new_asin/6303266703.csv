618853,5,6303266703,"Crossroads is one of the best videos the Bon Jovi Band has to date.  I received this one about 2 years ago in VHS format and watch it every weekend.  I'm a true Bon Jovi Fan.  All of the videos capture the essence  of what this band is all about.  Rock 'N Roll-they rock, they roll, and  they show another side of themselves and the Band as a whole in this video.  I think someone mentioned that Living In Sin is not on it.  They may not  have watched the whole video because it is definitely there and it's great.  I highly recommend this video for any hardcore Bon Jovi Fans. Looking for  it in DVD Format, if anyone has it yet, please let me know.  Thank you.",953769600,14,662,4.0859375

There are very few collections of music videos like this around for rock 'n roll bands.  Playing this tape in your VCR is like listening to a favorite CD over and over.",1014422400,,260,4.285714285714286
7842815,5,6303266703,"If you like Bon Jovi, you will LOVE this video!!  It contains unreleashed videos of ""Living in Sin"", ""Dry County"", and many more.  It depicts the transition from the ""80's glam rock / heavy metal"" to the 90's rock flavor.  I own almost everything Bon Jovi has done, and this is well worth the money!  It has more videos on it than any other videos I own.  A MUST HAVE!!!",1008028800,9,370,4.228571428571429
7842816,5,6303266703,"If you appreciate the many years of talent the Bon Jovi band has given it's fans, this compilation of music videos is an excellent choice to add to your collection. The band is superb! Pop the tape into the VCR when you're hanging around the house. I love it. I recommend it 100%.",999561600,7,280,4.30188679245283
7842817,5,6303266703,"I can barely remember when Bon Jovi's early videos received constant airplay on MTV...this video has allowed me to relive those moments. From the early days of ""Livin' On a Prayer"" and ""You Give Love a Bad Name,"" all of which were mostly concert footage, the band embarks on a journey both musically and in their video style. By the time the 90s hit and ""Keep the Faith"" is released, you see a different band and different kinds of videos. Highlights on the video include ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" ""Living in Sin,"" and ""Always,"" the new release that rocked the video world with constant play. True Bon Jovi fans should own this video as an item to turn on all the time, and see great songs and the evolution of a great band that outlived the other so-called ""hair bands."" This video should accompany the band's greatest hits album of the same name, but the video includes songs like ""Living in Sin,"" ""Dry County,"" and ""In These Arms,"" that were not included on the audio release. Definitely a must-have.",983491200,26,1001,4.597765363128492
7842818,4,6303266703,"If you're a Bon Jovi fan, you will like this video.  All the popular songs are here up to and including the Crossroad album.  It's amusing to see the evolution of the hair-band from ""Shot Through The Heart"" to ""Dry County"".  My only complaint is that I wish we could see Bon Jovi themselves talk about the videos or the songs since this is just a music video collection.  But I love Bon Jovi and this video is a treat.",970531200,4,418,4.1875
