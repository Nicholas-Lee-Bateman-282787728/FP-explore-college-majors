2966969,5,B000WCN7M4,"I really love this series - especially the final series (3).  With all the interest in British mysteries and gardening, I am amazed that the show was not developed many, many years ago.  Sadly, the Rosemary & Thyme series only lasted for 3 series and was abruptly cancelled.

The premise of the story is about two women of middle age who each face life-changing experiences (one, a pending divorce and the other is fired from her position as professor of horticulture from a UK college).  Both characters befriend each other and start their own gardening business.  This new adventure takes them all over the UK as well as Spain, France, and Italy.

While working on gardens, they always seem to stumble upon murders.  Both Rosemary & Thyme add their unique skills and gifts to solve these murders all the while designing and planting breath-taking gardens.

There are many aspects of the series that I find wonderful, but the thing I appreciate the most is the knowledge, that even those of us in our middle years can find new adventures and create new identities which bring us happiness and fulfillment.

Partly due to this show, I had since enrolled in a garden design course to start me on a new adventure as a designer.... Thanks Rosemary & Thyme!",1196121600,65,1253,4.7373271889400925
2966970,4,B000WCN7M4,"Most mystery series have big tough longtime cops or lovably eccentric oddballs as their detectives.

So it's a bit refreshing to see a pair of utterly ordinary detectives in the light mystery series ""Rosemary and Thyme"" -- one a cop-turned-housewife, and one a feisty horticulturist. You won't find any mind-blowing mysteries, just solid whodunnits and likable characters... and plants. Lots and lots of beautiful plants.

Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) has just been dumped by her husband of 27 years, for a ""twenty-three-year-old tart!"" When visiting an old pal, she encounters plant pathologist Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) who is promptly fired by her slimy boss. The two wronged women team together to solve a bizarre mystery involving poisonous plants, a car wreck, and a serial killer.

After that, Rosemary and Laura go into business together, treating sick lawns and creating picturesque gardens. But like any good detectives, they keep bumping into sinister crimes, both of the past and present: a spa matriarch is strangled at her desk, skeletons are uncovered in a murdered pop star's garden, and a man is killed in a graveyard... with an arrow.

Things don't improve much in the following seasons -- Rosemary and Laura end up dealing with wrecked romantic gardens, Parisian theft and murder, school pranks gone wrong, Italian restaurants, ferocious competition at a garden show, murder at a vineyard, sabotaged plays and tennis camps.... and even an abandoned baby that may have something to do with a murder.

""Rosemary and Thyme"" is notable more for its cozy, cottagey feel than for its intricate mysteries -- but then again, they don't try to be complex or twisty. Instead, the stories focus on our likable horticulturists, and the lovely gardens they create or restore... and the entertaining dialogue (""You've broken the bloody window!"" Rosemary yells at a sniper) makes this even more fun.

There's a pleasantly old-fashioned flavour to the series -- lots of vine-draped cottages, manorhouses, luxurious resorts, vineyards and herbal skills. Sure, there's laptops, TV shows, drug dealers and myriad cell phones. But those are just the trappings on an ordinary little mystery series, where the plant sicknesses often have something to do with the murders.

Of course, the leads make or break a series like this. Fortunately, Kendal and Ferris have excellent chemistry. Laura and Rosemary are an entertaining pair, with just the right mix of similarities and differences. Laura is a sensible ex-cop/housewife who is still dealing with her family tensions, while Laura is a cultured academic (""more a bookworm than an earthworm"") with a rough streak.

Plant lovers and mystery buffs should enjoy the cozy, vine-covered mysteries of ""Rosemary and Thyme."" It's just fun and pleasant, all the way through.",1194048000,112,2816,5.256124721603563

The subtitles helped us get some of the little quirky comments they make to each other, and the twists in the plot.  The video and audio quality of the DVD is excellent so far.

2966994,5,B000WCN7M4,"By: Revit

Rosemary & Thyme are a delight. They are set in one glorious garden after another. And they each have a mystery to unfold for your further pleasure.  What fun! You can learn a little about both gardening and sleuthing in each episode. And at the end you can see the glorious gardens they have built.

Rosemary's career as a university plant biologist ended because of academic political reasons and Laura's career as a police officer ended due to a cheating husband who was also a police officer. But they make a great team and we are so fortunate that they happened to get together to bring us some of the best sleuthing and the most beautiful gardens you will ever see: Kew Gardens and Regent's Park in London, beautiful gardens in manor houses along the French Riviera, a Surry vineyard, Italy's Liguria coast, and the hills of Malaga Spain. They will give you many hours of sparkling beauty and keep your little grey cells exercised as well.

Buy them now, while they are on sale. The full boxed set contains 7 DVDs in three boxes. They will give you and your family 22 episodes, 18  hours of wide screen entertainment of British mystery and are a real bargain. There is a Bonus: An interview with Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris, 8 minutes plus a photo gallery.",1391990400,,1276,4.578947368421052

2967014,5,B000WCN7M4,"I was so glad to have found this series.  Only three seasons long, it is one of those series that I enjoy coming back to time and time again.

Staying in grand homes and setting the gardens to rights is always the main theme of each episode, but that seems to take a backseat to the murder de jour.  Professional horticulturalist Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme seem to find a murder nearby when they are working on the most incredible garden landscapes.  How much fun can there be pulling weeds and digging holes when there is a murder or three to be solved?  So the two endearing amateur sleuths bring the ragged clues together in time to catch the culprit and tidy up the garden before the soiree of the moment takes place.

This is one series that I had wished could go on forever, but I will just have to settle with watching these two women solve their landscaping issues and murder mysteries over and over again.",1312588800,,918,4.434523809523809

As for the stories, they are typical who-done-its where people are killed at an incredible rate and no one seems to notice the coincidence that this carnage follows the amateur detectives whereever they go.  Lots of fun, fairly good acting, (not the best, but who cares?), and the backdrop of English garden scenery, in its various stages of upkeep, warts and all, as they say, is a plus.",1306454400,,622,4.794392523364486

2967017,5,B000WCN7M4,"I have watched this Complete Series several times, and I am still in awe of the beautiful gardens, love the two sleuthing horticulturalists, and wish there had been more stories to tell.

Pam Ferris and Felicity Kendal have terrific chemistry as two ""women of a certain age"" who, after each has just gone through life-altering events, become partners in a gardening business, close friends, and two of the most interesting, down-to earth (no pun intended) detectives you'll ever meet. Laura Thyme, newly dumped by her husband, and Dr. Rosemary Boxer, newly dumped by her university, find that they share not only a love of plants, but it seems also a love of uncovering and solving crime in the most unlikely places.

With Laura providing her long, unused police constable background, and Rosemary providing her extensive plant pathology background, they tackle murder in public gardens, monasteries, and private estates while landscaping some amazing locations. And still deal with their friends, families, and lovers (past and potential).

The interview with the two actresses, the photo galleries, actor bios, and the quiz on the special features were good, but even without these extras it's worth it.",1300060800,3,1205,5.233160621761658

Enter Rosemary Boxer a lecturer and plant pathologist let go from years of lecturing at her university.
Enter Laura Tyme, a gardening enthusiast, whose husband just left her for a much younger woman.
Both women are middle-aged and thrown together in the first episode by circumstances beyond their control. They quickly form a working relationship, a bit too quickly for me, as the audience to find credible, but it works.
The locales are pleasing to the eye, as are the gardens they are hired to redo. Neither woman is helpless and they work well together. Through the series, their friendship develops as they travel the UK and Europe countryside and get involved in the murders of others, either by being witnesses, bystanders, and even suspects. One episode even has Rosemary mistakenly being the murder victim.
I enjoy a good murder mystery and love gardening, and anyting that has to do with Britain, so this series is a hit for me, If you are an aficianado of either, or know someone that is, you'll/they'll enjoy this series.",1278720000,8,1152,4.943298969072165

2967041,5,B000WCN7M4,"Yes, it suffers from the 'ordinary people finding murder victims' syndrome.  But that's one of those things you have to overlook when you watch a lot of mysteries, unless you stick to only the police ones.  I don't know many people who continuously stumble over bodies, but I'm willing to accept, for whatever reason, that Laura and Rosemary just happen to be very unlucky.

As a team, they work together splendidly.  There's a chemistry there, and their strengths really do play off one another.  Laura's knowledge from being a cop long ago (and her still-current connections) lend some believability to their sleuthing.  The mysteries themselves are fun and intriguing, and in some cases fairly solve-able by the watcher.  There are enough twists and red herrings to keep you interested, and the dynamics and dialogue between the characters is fun and natural (with one exception, I'll get to that).  Laura and Rosemary are genuinely likable characters, and it's nice seeing older leading ladies that are happy with themselves and, for the most part, their lives (Laura is still a little upset and bitter about her ex, but that's to be expected - still, she pulls herself up and moves on).

The problems are ones common to mysteries of this genre - the bad guys always confess, and there's that forced moment of levity at the end of most of the episodes.  That aside, though, they're a great deal of fun and I'd recommend them to any cozy mystery or amateur sleuth lover.",1241222400,,1473,4.8326693227091635

The scenery in the series is excellent, and the plot always migrates from garden restoration to a mystery that must be solved.

Even though the 2 sleuths are not young bucks, they are entertaining and engaging. This isn't just a series for your grandmother to watch, the younger crowd will find it entertaining as well. Definately clean family fun so if you do give the set to your grandmother to watch, she won't be offended!

Compared to American TV, the British series seem to have characters that are ""real."" Their decisions, lives, and daily dilemmas have substance and are believable. Such is true with this series. The plots are fresh and have some unexpected twists to them.

2967056,5,B000WCN7M4,"""Rosemary & Thyme: The Complete Collection,"" comes to us a 9-volume value-packed box set collectors' edition, featuring all 22 episodes of series 1-3 of the hit British mystery series.  Like a lot of top British mysteries, this one that aired in the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2005, was syndicated nationally on public television stations here in the U.S., was actually made for, and shown by, Britain's ITV (Independent Television) stations.  It fits squarely in the classic British cozy school of mystery-writing, while combining beautiful garden locations with somewhat thin puzzlers (each episode is only 40+ minutes long).  And it bears the hallmarks of the best British TV: wonderful location shooting; two talented, experienced stars that exhibit great chemistry together; eccentric characters; strong supporting players.  The value-priced set has many interesting features, but, unfortunately, no subtitles, odd, as there can be little doubt that this is a show that appeals to an older demographic.  Luckily, however, the cast here seems to have been encouraged to speak standard Queen's English, and can be followed pretty well.

The package stars two able, popular comic TV actresses, both women of a certain age: Felicity Kendal, best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Neighbors-The-Complete-Series-1-3/dp/B000784WKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Neighbors - The Complete Series 1-3</a>, as Rosemary Boxer; and Pam Ferris,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Harry-Potter-3/dp/B00005JMAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 3)</a>, as Laura Thyme.  I also noted Antony Andrews, Oliver Ford Davies, Phyllida Law, Michael Maloney, Margaret Tyzack, and Julian Wadham in the credits.  Locations featured  a seemingly endless parade of countryside manor houses, hotels and pubs; a Surrey vineyard; and some of London's greenest private squares and public gardens; also the French Riviera, Italy's Ligurian Coast, and Malaga, Spain.  Peculiarly enough, for an entertainment seemingly aimed squarely at an older, female audience, the show was largely, if not entirely, written and directed by men.  Though you'd be surprised -- or perhaps not -- at how often the villain is a woman, generally comely, and young, as well. (Real Agatha Christie touches, to be sure.) The evocative title music is based on the old English air ""Scarborough Fair;"" it was performed by John Williams.

Things do seem to take place in a kind of Camelot,where the sun always shines, and it never is wintry (characters even discuss Christmas in shirtsleeves).  But an astonishing number of people get themselves killed in each episode.  It's tempting to say the presence of these two gardeners is downright lethal. You'd almost wonder why anybody ever calls them, though I don't recall that any of their actual clients gets slain. Still, they're violence-free, blood-free murders, and each episode entertains.  All in all, you'd have to say it was more a relaxing hot cocoa than a martini night of entertainment, but most of our lives have plenty of room for that.",1226707200,9,3280,5.963752665245202

The quality of the picture was top rate, the gardens were enviously beautiful when completed (and I got some good ideas from them!), and the plots were well drawn.  Of course, the two actresses were great--both funny and engaging.  It is wonderful to see ""ladies of a certain age"" (ie, my own) on the screen and being shown to still have interesting, even exciting, lives.  Even their Range Rover is a character who plays an important role--sort of like a side kick in the old westerns.  My set of DVDs is now making the rounds of my friends who are deriving great enjoyment from them.

2967068,5,B000WCN7M4,"It's well known that Brits generally do murder better than Yanks (or anyone else, for that matter).  This trend started with Conan Doyle and continues right down to the present moment.  Part of the reason for this is that Brit mysteries are genteel and intelligent.  Yank mysteries are often written as if the main audience consists of cave men.  Which is, alas, all too true.  Even so, the Brit example is starting to sink in on this side of the pond.  Virtually all of the main characters in superb series such as ""Bones"" and ""Numbers"" consist of nerds who actually use 3- and 4-syllables (and bigger) words.  They also omit gratuitous violence (tiresome) and profanity (even more tiresome).  Readers may also recall the spectacular success of ""Murder She Wrote"", set among the rural beauty of the Murder Capital of New England, Cabot Cove.  Genteel, engaging, beautifully filmed, this was everything a good mystery ought to be.  If you actually like urban grunge and gritty plotting, but want something from the Brits in that line, there's always Helen Mirren's ""Prime Suspect"".  This is really good grunge and grit, especially if you want Brit quality instead of slipshod Yank stuff that uses gratuitous violence to distract you from the vapidity of what you're watching.

The problem is that good Brit mysteries outnumber Yank ones as the Chinese outnumber the Brits.  This first decade of the 21st Century is no exception.  From 2003 to 2007 we were treated to the wonderful ""Rosemary and Thyme"".  All indications are that after 3 seasons (03, 04, 06/07) and 2 specials (04, 05), R&T are through.  Well, we still have the long-running ""Midsomer Murders"" and the more recent ""The Last Detective"".

Rosemary Boxer (played wonderfully by Felicity Kendal) and Laura Thyme (played even better if possible by Pam Ferris) meet by chance as the latter's husband is deserting her.  They go into business as professional gardeners and go about (mostly) rebuilding decrepit plantings.  Lo and behold, very shortly they have a body in their garden.  Unlike the Midsomer people, the R&T people spread the wealth of death around, taking their characters to beautiful places in England, France, Italy, and Spain.  The gardens are often spectacular, and even if not (one episode involves a lawn; another, a grape grove), there is usually a beautiful and/or interesting building to compensate.  What we don't get is the American favorite, (ugh!) urban grunge.

The mysteries themselves are all to brief - all episodes but 2 longer ones are only 48 minutes (as opposed to, say, 100 for Midsomer).  In the beginning the girls don't solve the murder so much as they flush the guilty party into the waiting arms of the police.  Mostly, however, they work out whodunit.  These are good little conundrums, but it would be nice if they had more time in which to get worked out.

The scripts are clever and witty, informed by an insidious sense of humor.  They're full of hilarious throwaway quips and verbal exchanges.  This tendency reaches its height in the last episode in the set (the 2005 special), ""The Cup of Silence"".  Here we get an actual black-out skit,  la Ernie Kovacs, which we should call ""The Donkey Shop"".  It proceeds from the outr premise that somebody would actually try to make a go of a gift shop that sells nothing but donkey-related items.  This builds in an exchange right out of Monty Python that leads to one of the most wonderful puns I've ever heard.

Besides, any series that dares to have one of its characters quote the immortal limerick, ""While Titian was mixing rose madder"", can do no wrong.

OK. Tiziano (Titian) Tecelli (1477-1571!) was a great artist.  Despite its name, rose madder (root of the plant of the same name) is a brilliant red, often referred to a ""true"" red.  OK, I had to look up the dates.

Aside from the witty scripts, the acting is on a par with them.  There are several talented guest stars, including the brilliant Phyllida Law.  One of the stars is a gizmo - that used to steam the grape groves in ""Cup of Silence"".  Bless us, holy Rube Goldberg!!

R&T comes on 9 DVDs in a compact case.  The discs are just a little difficult to remove.  The aspect is 16x9.  Typical of Brit programs (and this is a serious flaw), there are no subtitles.  One of the ""special features"" actually is special.  The first DVD for each season (or ""series"", as the Brits refer to it) contains a featurette on the locations used for that season.  These are informative and have some beautiful footage.  The rest is silence (of which, as previously noted, you can get a whole cup with the last disc).

Note on the lack of subtitles:  luckily, the actors' diction is particularly precise and clear overall.  Subtitles are not quite the necessity they normally are, although people who don't hear well, or at all, will find this lack damn inconsiderate.

As you might have figured, I highly recommend this collection.  It will give you 18 hours of viewing pleasure at a cost only a couple of inches of shelf space.",1205020800,22,5029,4.779326364692218

The premise of the story is about two women of middle age who each face life-changing experiences (one, a pending divorce and the other is fired from her position as professor of horticulture from a UK college).  Both characters befriend each other and start their own gardening business.  This new adventure takes them all over the UK as well as Spain, France, and Italy.

While working on gardens, they always seem to stumble upon murders.  Both Rosemary & Thyme add their unique skills and gifts to solve these murders all the while designing and planting breath-taking gardens.

There are many aspects of the series that I find wonderful, but the thing I appreciate the most is the knowledge, that even those of us in our middle years can find new adventures and create new identities which bring us happiness and fulfillment.

Partly due to this show, I had since enrolled in a garden design course to start me on a new adventure as a designer.... Thanks Rosemary & Thyme!",1196121600,65,1253,4.7373271889400925
3201467,4,B000WCN7M4,"Most mystery series have big tough longtime cops or lovably eccentric oddballs as their detectives.

So it's a bit refreshing to see a pair of utterly ordinary detectives in the light mystery series ""Rosemary and Thyme"" -- one a cop-turned-housewife, and one a feisty horticulturist. You won't find any mind-blowing mysteries, just solid whodunnits and likable characters... and plants. Lots and lots of beautiful plants.

Laura Thyme (Pam Ferris) has just been dumped by her husband of 27 years, for a ""twenty-three-year-old tart!"" When visiting an old pal, she encounters plant pathologist Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal) who is promptly fired by her slimy boss. The two wronged women team together to solve a bizarre mystery involving poisonous plants, a car wreck, and a serial killer.

After that, Rosemary and Laura go into business together, treating sick lawns and creating picturesque gardens. But like any good detectives, they keep bumping into sinister crimes, both of the past and present: a spa matriarch is strangled at her desk, skeletons are uncovered in a murdered pop star's garden, and a man is killed in a graveyard... with an arrow.

Things don't improve much in the following seasons -- Rosemary and Laura end up dealing with wrecked romantic gardens, Parisian theft and murder, school pranks gone wrong, Italian restaurants, ferocious competition at a garden show, murder at a vineyard, sabotaged plays and tennis camps.... and even an abandoned baby that may have something to do with a murder.

""Rosemary and Thyme"" is notable more for its cozy, cottagey feel than for its intricate mysteries -- but then again, they don't try to be complex or twisty. Instead, the stories focus on our likable horticulturists, and the lovely gardens they create or restore... and the entertaining dialogue (""You've broken the bloody window!"" Rosemary yells at a sniper) makes this even more fun.

There's a pleasantly old-fashioned flavour to the series -- lots of vine-draped cottages, manorhouses, luxurious resorts, vineyards and herbal skills. Sure, there's laptops, TV shows, drug dealers and myriad cell phones. But those are just the trappings on an ordinary little mystery series, where the plant sicknesses often have something to do with the murders.

Of course, the leads make or break a series like this. Fortunately, Kendal and Ferris have excellent chemistry. Laura and Rosemary are an entertaining pair, with just the right mix of similarities and differences. Laura is a sensible ex-cop/housewife who is still dealing with her family tensions, while Laura is a cultured academic (""more a bookworm than an earthworm"") with a rough streak.

Plant lovers and mystery buffs should enjoy the cozy, vine-covered mysteries of ""Rosemary and Thyme."" It's just fun and pleasant, all the way through.",1194048000,112,2816,5.256124721603563

Rosemary & Thyme are a delight. They are set in one glorious garden after another. And they each have a mystery to unfold for your further pleasure.  What fun! You can learn a little about both gardening and sleuthing in each episode. And at the end you can see the glorious gardens they have built.

Rosemary's career as a university plant biologist ended because of academic political reasons and Laura's career as a police officer ended due to a cheating husband who was also a police officer. But they make a great team and we are so fortunate that they happened to get together to bring us some of the best sleuthing and the most beautiful gardens you will ever see: Kew Gardens and Regent's Park in London, beautiful gardens in manor houses along the French Riviera, a Surry vineyard, Italy's Liguria coast, and the hills of Malaga Spain. They will give you many hours of sparkling beauty and keep your little grey cells exercised as well.

Buy them now, while they are on sale. The full boxed set contains 7 DVDs in three boxes. They will give you and your family 22 episodes, 18  hours of wide screen entertainment of British mystery and are a real bargain. There is a Bonus: An interview with Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris, 8 minutes plus a photo gallery.",1391990400,,1276,4.578947368421052

3201511,5,B000WCN7M4,"I was so glad to have found this series.  Only three seasons long, it is one of those series that I enjoy coming back to time and time again.

Staying in grand homes and setting the gardens to rights is always the main theme of each episode, but that seems to take a backseat to the murder de jour.  Professional horticulturalist Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme seem to find a murder nearby when they are working on the most incredible garden landscapes.  How much fun can there be pulling weeds and digging holes when there is a murder or three to be solved?  So the two endearing amateur sleuths bring the ragged clues together in time to catch the culprit and tidy up the garden before the soiree of the moment takes place.

This is one series that I had wished could go on forever, but I will just have to settle with watching these two women solve their landscaping issues and murder mysteries over and over again.",1312588800,,918,4.434523809523809

As for the stories, they are typical who-done-its where people are killed at an incredible rate and no one seems to notice the coincidence that this carnage follows the amateur detectives whereever they go.  Lots of fun, fairly good acting, (not the best, but who cares?), and the backdrop of English garden scenery, in its various stages of upkeep, warts and all, as they say, is a plus.",1306454400,,622,4.794392523364486

Pam Ferris and Felicity Kendal have terrific chemistry as two ""women of a certain age"" who, after each has just gone through life-altering events, become partners in a gardening business, close friends, and two of the most interesting, down-to earth (no pun intended) detectives you'll ever meet. Laura Thyme, newly dumped by her husband, and Dr. Rosemary Boxer, newly dumped by her university, find that they share not only a love of plants, but it seems also a love of uncovering and solving crime in the most unlikely places.

With Laura providing her long, unused police constable background, and Rosemary providing her extensive plant pathology background, they tackle murder in public gardens, monasteries, and private estates while landscaping some amazing locations. And still deal with their friends, families, and lovers (past and potential).

The interview with the two actresses, the photo galleries, actor bios, and the quiz on the special features were good, but even without these extras it's worth it.",1300060800,3,1205,5.233160621761658

Enter Rosemary Boxer a lecturer and plant pathologist let go from years of lecturing at her university.
Enter Laura Tyme, a gardening enthusiast, whose husband just left her for a much younger woman.
Both women are middle-aged and thrown together in the first episode by circumstances beyond their control. They quickly form a working relationship, a bit too quickly for me, as the audience to find credible, but it works.
The locales are pleasing to the eye, as are the gardens they are hired to redo. Neither woman is helpless and they work well together. Through the series, their friendship develops as they travel the UK and Europe countryside and get involved in the murders of others, either by being witnesses, bystanders, and even suspects. One episode even has Rosemary mistakenly being the murder victim.

My only complaint is that the sound level varies from episode to episode.

Buy this series if you want to spend an enjoyable time with friendly characters in a series with a sense of a reassuring familiarity. There's nothing gruesome, sexual, or otherwise inappropriate, so you don't have to worry about putting these in with little kids around.",1243728000,,538,4.9010989010989015

3201538,5,B000WCN7M4,"Yes, it suffers from the 'ordinary people finding murder victims' syndrome.  But that's one of those things you have to overlook when you watch a lot of mysteries, unless you stick to only the police ones.  I don't know many people who continuously stumble over bodies, but I'm willing to accept, for whatever reason, that Laura and Rosemary just happen to be very unlucky.

As a team, they work together splendidly.  There's a chemistry there, and their strengths really do play off one another.  Laura's knowledge from being a cop long ago (and her still-current connections) lend some believability to their sleuthing.  The mysteries themselves are fun and intriguing, and in some cases fairly solve-able by the watcher.  There are enough twists and red herrings to keep you interested, and the dynamics and dialogue between the characters is fun and natural (with one exception, I'll get to that).  Laura and Rosemary are genuinely likable characters, and it's nice seeing older leading ladies that are happy with themselves and, for the most part, their lives (Laura is still a little upset and bitter about her ex, but that's to be expected - still, she pulls herself up and moves on).

The problems are ones common to mysteries of this genre - the bad guys always confess, and there's that forced moment of levity at the end of most of the episodes.  That aside, though, they're a great deal of fun and I'd recommend them to any cozy mystery or amateur sleuth lover.",1241222400,,1473,4.8326693227091635

These two female, mostly horticulturists, but always involved in some murder mystery, characters always have a new beautiful garden to restore. The scenery in the series is excellent, and the plot always migrates from garden restoration to a mystery that must be solved.

Even though the 2 sleuths are not young bucks, they are entertaining and engaging. This isn't just a series for your grandmother to watch, the younger crowd will find it entertaining as well. Definately clean family fun so if you do give the set to your grandmother to watch, she won't be offended!

Compared to American TV, the British series seem to have characters that are ""real."" Their decisions, lives, and daily dilemmas have substance and are believable. Such is true with this series. The plots are fresh and have some unexpected twists to them.

I wish this series had run for many more years! If you enjoy female sleuths, also check out the Hetty Wainthropp series. I found Rosemary and Thyme's plots slightly more entertaining than the Wainthropp series, but both collections are excellent!",1227916800,2,1189,5.087179487179487

3201553,5,B000WCN7M4,"""Rosemary & Thyme: The Complete Collection,"" comes to us a 9-volume value-packed box set collectors' edition, featuring all 22 episodes of series 1-3 of the hit British mystery series.  Like a lot of top British mysteries, this one that aired in the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2005, was syndicated nationally on public television stations here in the U.S., was actually made for, and shown by, Britain's ITV (Independent Television) stations.  It fits squarely in the classic British cozy school of mystery-writing, while combining beautiful garden locations with somewhat thin puzzlers (each episode is only 40+ minutes long).  And it bears the hallmarks of the best British TV: wonderful location shooting; two talented, experienced stars that exhibit great chemistry together; eccentric characters; strong supporting players.  The value-priced set has many interesting features, but, unfortunately, no subtitles, odd, as there can be little doubt that this is a show that appeals to an older demographic.  Luckily, however, the cast here seems to have been encouraged to speak standard Queen's English, and can be followed pretty well.

The package stars two able, popular comic TV actresses, both women of a certain age: Felicity Kendal, best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Neighbors-The-Complete-Series-1-3/dp/B000784WKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Neighbors - The Complete Series 1-3</a>, as Rosemary Boxer; and Pam Ferris,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Harry-Potter-3/dp/B00005JMAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 3)</a>, as Laura Thyme.  I also noted Antony Andrews, Oliver Ford Davies, Phyllida Law, Michael Maloney, Margaret Tyzack, and Julian Wadham in the credits.  Locations featured  a seemingly endless parade of countryside manor houses, hotels and pubs; a Surrey vineyard; and some of London's greenest private squares and public gardens; also the French Riviera, Italy's Ligurian Coast, and Malaga, Spain.  Peculiarly enough, for an entertainment seemingly aimed squarely at an older, female audience, the show was largely, if not entirely, written and directed by men.  Though you'd be surprised -- or perhaps not -- at how often the villain is a woman, generally comely, and young, as well. (Real Agatha Christie touches, to be sure.) The evocative title music is based on the old English air ""Scarborough Fair;"" it was performed by John Williams.

Things do seem to take place in a kind of Camelot,where the sun always shines, and it never is wintry (characters even discuss Christmas in shirtsleeves).  But an astonishing number of people get themselves killed in each episode.  It's tempting to say the presence of these two gardeners is downright lethal. You'd almost wonder why anybody ever calls them, though I don't recall that any of their actual clients gets slain. Still, they're violence-free, blood-free murders, and each episode entertains.  All in all, you'd have to say it was more a relaxing hot cocoa than a martini night of entertainment, but most of our lives have plenty of room for that.",1226707200,9,3280,5.963752665245202

I had first seen a couple of episodes while staying in England and was impressed, and now have thoroughly enjoyed working my way through all of the the episodes on my new home theatre system.  The quality of the picture was top rate, the gardens were enviously beautiful when completed (and I got some good ideas from them!), and the plots were well drawn.  Of course, the two actresses were great--both funny and engaging.  It is wonderful to see ""ladies of a certain age"" (ie, my own) on the screen and being shown to still have interesting, even exciting, lives.  Even their Range Rover is a character who plays an important role--sort of like a side kick in the old westerns.  My set of DVDs is now making the rounds of my friends who are deriving great enjoyment from them.  It is the kind of set you could sit down to watch every year and know you are in for guaranteed fun!

3201565,5,B000WCN7M4,"It's well known that Brits generally do murder better than Yanks (or anyone else, for that matter).  This trend started with Conan Doyle and continues right down to the present moment.  Part of the reason for this is that Brit mysteries are genteel and intelligent.  Yank mysteries are often written as if the main audience consists of cave men.  Which is, alas, all too true.  Even so, the Brit example is starting to sink in on this side of the pond.  Virtually all of the main characters in superb series such as ""Bones"" and ""Numbers"" consist of nerds who actually use 3- and 4-syllables (and bigger) words.  They also omit gratuitous violence (tiresome) and profanity (even more tiresome).  Readers may also recall the spectacular success of ""Murder She Wrote"", set among the rural beauty of the Murder Capital of New England, Cabot Cove.  Genteel, engaging, beautifully filmed, this was everything a good mystery ought to be.  If you actually like urban grunge and gritty plotting, but want something from the Brits in that line, there's always Helen Mirren's ""Prime Suspect"".  This is really good grunge and grit, especially if you want Brit quality instead of slipshod Yank stuff that uses gratuitous violence to distract you from the vapidity of what you're watching.

The problem is that good Brit mysteries outnumber Yank ones as the Chinese outnumber the Brits.  This first decade of the 21st Century is no exception.  From 2003 to 2007 we were treated to the wonderful ""Rosemary and Thyme"".  All indications are that after 3 seasons (03, 04, 06/07) and 2 specials (04, 05), R&T are through.  Well, we still have the long-running ""Midsomer Murders"" and the more recent ""The Last Detective"".

Rosemary Boxer (played wonderfully by Felicity Kendal) and Laura Thyme (played even better if possible by Pam Ferris) meet by chance as the latter's husband is deserting her.  They go into business as professional gardeners and go about (mostly) rebuilding decrepit plantings.  Lo and behold, very shortly they have a body in their garden.  Unlike the Midsomer people, the R&T people spread the wealth of death around, taking their characters to beautiful places in England, France, Italy, and Spain.  The gardens are often spectacular, and even if not (one episode involves a lawn; another, a grape grove), there is usually a beautiful and/or interesting building to compensate.  What we don't get is the American favorite, (ugh!) urban grunge.

The mysteries themselves are all to brief - all episodes but 2 longer ones are only 48 minutes (as opposed to, say, 100 for Midsomer).  In the beginning the girls don't solve the murder so much as they flush the guilty party into the waiting arms of the police.  Mostly, however, they work out whodunit.  These are good little conundrums, but it would be nice if they had more time in which to get worked out.

The scripts are clever and witty, informed by an insidious sense of humor.  They're full of hilarious throwaway quips and verbal exchanges.  This tendency reaches its height in the last episode in the set (the 2005 special), ""The Cup of Silence"".  Here we get an actual black-out skit,  la Ernie Kovacs, which we should call ""The Donkey Shop"".  It proceeds from the outr premise that somebody would actually try to make a go of a gift shop that sells nothing but donkey-related items.  This builds in an exchange right out of Monty Python that leads to one of the most wonderful puns I've ever heard.

Besides, any series that dares to have one of its characters quote the immortal limerick, ""While Titian was mixing rose madder"", can do no wrong.

OK. Tiziano (Titian) Tecelli (1477-1571!) was a great artist.  Despite its name, rose madder (root of the plant of the same name) is a brilliant red, often referred to a ""true"" red.  OK, I had to look up the dates.

Aside from the witty scripts, the acting is on a par with them.  There are several talented guest stars, including the brilliant Phyllida Law.  One of the stars is a gizmo - that used to steam the grape groves in ""Cup of Silence"".  Bless us, holy Rube Goldberg!!

R&T comes on 9 DVDs in a compact case.  The discs are just a little difficult to remove.  The aspect is 16x9.  Typical of Brit programs (and this is a serious flaw), there are no subtitles.  One of the ""special features"" actually is special.  The first DVD for each season (or ""series"", as the Brits refer to it) contains a featurette on the locations used for that season.  These are informative and have some beautiful footage.  The rest is silence (of which, as previously noted, you can get a whole cup with the last disc).

Note on the lack of subtitles:  luckily, the actors' diction is particularly precise and clear overall.  Subtitles are not quite the necessity they normally are, although people who don't hear well, or at all, will find this lack damn inconsiderate.

As you might have figured, I highly recommend this collection.  It will give you 18 hours of viewing pleasure at a cost only a couple of inches of shelf space.",1205020800,22,5029,4.779326364692218

While out a friend's estate Rosemary meets Laura, a friendship begins and they solve two murders to boot!!  This begins a partnership, creating or treating estate gardens in England and Europe.

But I would never hire them, as at each assignment a dead body appears!  But a good gardners, they also tidy up the murder.

Two women, each have a Life changing experience just before the series starts. Soon they become friends. One a hands on gardener, with a law enforcement back ground Laura Thyme, (Pam Ferris), the other an academic horticulturist with an old four wheeler vehicle Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal).

The programs are of the two trying to find out who dunnit and how. We do not get bogged down in love interests.

Each episode is unique in its approach. The only pattern I see is that it is like in the movie ""A shot in the dark"" where everyone is guilty except the maid. In this series there may not be a lit of murderers, however there are a lot of guilty people.
