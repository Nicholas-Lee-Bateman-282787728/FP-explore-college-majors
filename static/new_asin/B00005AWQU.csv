With elements of action, drama, and comedy, I can only say, ""Awesome!"" George Clinton is a scruffy, clad-in-black, sharp-shooting gunfighter looking for the bad guy and some gold. This Spaghetti-Western has a suprisingly good plot and is well carried out. And After watching the flick, you just want to be George! Bravo!",1000598400,4,436,5.154929577464789
1418933,4,B00005AWQU,"Western with lots of cool characters, lines and stunts.
The lead character is based on an Eastwood character, but does okay. He and another ""tough"" gunman - who always carries a lady's parasol (hilarious) - are hired to watch a gold shipment. Plenty of gunfighting, stunt-shooting, and dead-pan lines.",996883200,,301,5.163265306122449

7935965,3,B00005AWQU,"Disclaimer: I watched a version of this film titled 'I am Sartana...Trade Your Guns for a Coffin' on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunslinger-Western-Collection/dp/B002GOAGP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunslinger Western Collection</a>.  As such, I cannot comment on the quality of the item featured on this product page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

Uruguayan-born George Hilton takes over the reins of the title character in the Sartana series for the first and last time in this mediocre effort from 1970, directed by Giuliano Carnimeo and co-starring Erika Blanc and Charles Southwood.  This time, Sartana matches wits with Sabbath (Southwood), a parasol-toting, poetry reading gunslinger as each attempt to relieve a crooked banker from a horde of gold stolen from honest miners.  But local saloon owner Trixie (Blanc), may be more than either can handle as she waits for the last man standing.

The Sartana character appeared in 20 films between 1966 and 1972 (though only five are considered 'official'), and while he also shared an almost supernatural proficiency with a pistol as other iconic gunfighters of the Italian Western genre, his trademarks had more to do with his use of a small, derringer-style pistol (invented for the film), and a reliance on gimmicks and gadgets.  This last came from the director of the initial installment, and his interest in James Bond, though in the Sartana films I've seen, the gadget use is only a small element of the character.

Of the 'official' films (by whoever determines such things), the lead role was played by Gianni Garko for the first four, then by Hilton in this last chapter, and I think the film's lackluster appeal rests mostly with Hilton.  There are some script issues too, though that's never been much of an issue with me when it comes to Italian Westerns.  The success of these films, or lack thereof, depends more on the panache of the actors and directors, who, it often seems to me, are saying 'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead', plainly unapologetic when it comes to inconsistency, historical inaccuracy, and sheer lunacy - if it serves the higher purpose of Style.  From Hilton, I get the vibe that he's not committed, almost as if he's winking along with the audience at the silliness of the whole thing.

These movies aren't sacred cows I'm talking about, but their charm is evidently rather fragile, because, in the end, this Sartana film seems limp and dull.  The effort to create another iconic character in the form of Sabbath doesn't work for me either - it's just too preposterous.  A bright spot, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Man-Run/dp/B0001KUE78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run, Man, Run!</a>, is a supporting role by Nello Pazzafini, playing the role he was born to play, a boorish, yet somehow likeable, bandit leader.

Overall, a disappointment for me, after being pleasantly surprised by Garko's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-You-Meet-Sartana-Pray-For-Your-Death/dp/B000CS4420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If You Meet Sartana Pray For Your Death</a>.  Two-and-a-half stars, rounded up for the over-the-top energy Nello Pazzafi brings to his role.

The multi-pack release by Pop Flix that contained the version of the film that I watched was serviceable for the entertainment value for the film, though the picture itself was less than pristine to say the least.  Still, for the cost of around a dollar a movie, I was happy.  Serious collectors may wish to hunt up a better copy - those with a casual interest like myself may best be served with one of the many collections that includes this film.",1293840000,,3788,5.556521739130435
7935966,5,B00005AWQU,"Classic spaghetti western here...as other's have pointed out, bad acting, bad production & sound, et cetera.  Exactly what you expect from the genre.  Before buying this, however, try to find the Wild West ten movie pack - Fistful of Lead is included (along with nine other ""gems"").",1218153600,,282,4.9787234042553195
7935967,2,B00005AWQU,"Fistful of Lead (AKA I Am Sartana, Trade Your Guns for a Coffin) is a very pedestrian effort. Although it was better than, for example, the much better known Sabata, the filmmakers are obviously not trying very hard.

The movie is another retread of superhuman gunfighters chasing after gold in the west, which was the story of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and countless other imitators. This time, the hero, played by George Hilton, is without charisma, does not look tough, and does not look like a cowboy. There are a few cleverly thought out gun tricks and the sexy female lead, Erika Blanc, is easy on the eyes, but otherwise the only fun I had with this one was trying to pick out actors I had seen in other spaghetti westerns (it has the villian from the Stranger's Gundown in a bit part). One specific thing that really bothered me, as a dedicated western fan, I appreciate it when filmmakers go the extra mile to make their movies historically accurate. Of course, with a B-list oater like this one, that is of course expecting too much, but in one scene, a thug pulls a switchblade on a saloonkeeper. I don't think an anachronism of this magnitude reflects just a general laziness of the people involved in the film, but also a complete disregard for the audience in general.

I have heard it described as a comedy, and although the tone is light, I wouldn't compare it to the Trinity movies or anything.

The presentation is washed out pan and scan. It doesn't look very good, but if you're accustomed to BCI's public domain movies, you won't be bothered by it. Extras include a washed out 1930's Warner Bros. cartoon. It was better than the movie, but completely unrelated. Other extras are a movie trivia game, with questions about Apocalypse Now and other vastly superior movies, a glossary of technical DVD terms (something every spaghetti western fan needs LOL), and DVD-ROM extras that I couldn't get to work on my computer.

This movie is pretty much a turkey, so I encourage genre fans to buy this or any really cheap version of the movie you can find, because it is NOT worth spending a lot of money on. Non-genre fans stay away.",1201824000,,2152,4.596354166666667
7935968,4,B00005AWQU,"this movie was great, the dubbing was real bad but who cares, if you like westerns you'll like this movie, awesome gun play and bad acting make it fun to watch.  The ending showdown is must see, I laugh every time i watch it.",1108339200,3,225,4.113636363636363
7935969,3,B00005AWQU,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse release of this film. As of this writing, the only available release.
4 stars for the movie, 1 star for the transfer to DVD.
Forgive me ClintThe good - The story of Fistful of Lead is actually quite good, with a few twists and turns I didn't expect. Hey, even my wife liked this story of Sartana and his bounty hunter who play cat and mouse all through the movie. The stunts are well done, the gunplay is fast and the story moves right along.
The bad - Some of the acting is questionable, especially between the American and Italian actors, if a bit more time had been taken, maybe.
The ugly - The transfer to DVD is not the worst, but put it this way. Just pretend you're watching the movie on a UHF station overnight. To agree with others, it looks like it was taken from a tape and put on DVD. And if there were ever an argument to release wide screen movies in its original aspect ratio, this movie would make an excellent case. About three minutes into the movie, there is a scene where the camera wants you to believe you're taking the point of view of looking through binoculars. You can see how much of the binoculars are missing. The pan and scan method on this movie is dreadful.
Still, for the money, its decent. But if you are a fan of westerns, this movie besides being available individually is also in a 10 pack called The Wild West. For a little more than triple the price of this, you can get 10 pretty decent westerns. You can view this item on Amazon.com ....",1079049600,5,1562,4.2983050847457624
7935970,3,B00005AWQU,"This is a great spaghetti western!!! It's full of that classic spaghetti action and comedy!!! It's nice to see these classics on DVD, but this movie deserves much,much better!!! The three star rating is for the movie, not the DVD, which looks like a SLP VHS tape!!! The picture is terrible, well, for a DVD anyway!!! But the sound is actually good, still this DVD is pretty bad. This DVD is not widescreen either and the picture is severely cropped!!!",1072569600,3,451,4.65

7935972,1,B00005AWQU,"Originally titled ""C' Sartana... vendi la pistola e comprati la bara"" (or, ""I Am Sartana...Trade Your Guns for a Coffin""), this is one of the many sequels to the wildly successful ""Sartana.""  Alas, this is also one of the hundreds of absolutely, positively terrible-in-every-way spaghetti westerns: bad acting, bad production values, bad writing, and just generally a bad idea.  The director, Giuliano Carmineo, is responsible for such later dreck as ""Death Warriors"" and ""Poker in Bed.""  The writer, Tito Carpi, is best known for such bottom-feeder material as ""Thor, the Conqueror"" and the deathless ""Buck at the Edge of Heaven"" (no joke).  And its stars, George Hilton and Charles Southwood (whose penultimate film was ""She No Longer Talks She Shoots""--again, no joke), are pale reflections in a cloudy mirror on a rainy day of Clint Eastwood and Franco Nero.  In short, a relentlessly bad parodic western made by a cast and crew who specialized in exploitation flicks (mainly horror)--and fun only as a lark or a lesson in how cinema will, eventually, make anything by anybody, if someone thinks it will earn them a buck.",1033084800,11,1125,5.059459459459459
7935973,3,B00005AWQU,"I bought this film ...for a laugh, but was actually kinda surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's still a rip-off of both Leone's 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More', but is mildly entertaining for spaghetti western fans.

It looks like they worked off a poor tape copy instead of the original master, or maybe the master was damaged. A real disappointment. The movie itself is OK, but it's not in the same league as a ""Keoma"" or a ""Texas Adios"". Avoid at all cost !!!",1008028800,7,421,4.146341463414634
