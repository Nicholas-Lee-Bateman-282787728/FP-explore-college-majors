8634804,3,B00HRGTB46,"I was excited to see a 10th anniversary-ish show from TNA, and while these one night only shows are nothing spectacular (this one not really being an acception), this one isn't bad.

King vs. Petey vs. Dutt - This is a pretty awesome triple threat match (though on the dvd it's listed as a 4-way elimination match, oops). This match is your X-Division attraction for this show and like a lot of these type matches, it delivers perfectly. It's very satisfying and is action-packed from start to finish.

Gail vs. Sky - Basic knockouts match, nothing special.

Gauntlet Match - This match doesn't have a ton of star power considering it's a gauntlet that's supposed to cover 10 years of TNA wrestlers, but for what it is it's not bad. Got a lot of good spots in it and is just entertaining to watch.

3D vs. Bad Influence vs. LAX - Actually a very good match. All 3 of these teams are very good in this match, pretty awesome.

Hardy vs. Aries - Aries, like he always does, somehow some way makes his matches super awesome. While this matches of course doesn't compare to their Bound for Glory 2012 match, it's still decent.

Roode vs. Storm - I always see these guys in fantastic hardcore matches, to see them in a regular wrestling match is a little weird and under-welming.

Angle vs. Joe - Another match between these too, nothing special, have seen better between these two though.

Not a bad show but doesn't really live up to being a 10th Anniversary show, the matches are decent. And just like all the other One Night Only shows, same rule applies. Not bad, but get it cheap.",1408838400,,1580,4.5
8634805,4,B00HRGTB46,"The Sonjay Dutt-Petey Willams-Kenny King-3 way bout was fine but a bit disappointing. The Velvet Sky-Gail Kim match was perfectly acceptable even with the sloppy finish. The 10 Man Gauntlet match was not great but pretty good. The Team 3D-Bad Influence-LAX-3 way tag team bout was smartly worked,playing to everyone's strengths and never flet slow. The Jeff Hardy-Austin Aries match was a entertaining bout ot say the least. The James Storm-Bobby Roode match was a good bout even with a anticlimactic ending. The Samoa Joe-Kurt Angle main event while still good,it lack of the energy they had in past matches. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1396224000,,640,4.8807339449541285
8634806,4,B00HRGTB46,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based around celebrating the 10 year anniversary by having past names come back & some of the past rivalries in company history revisited with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show.  It should also be noted that the Top 10 TNA Moments they showed leading up to & during Slammiversary were repeated throughout the show.

Elimination Match: Sonjay Dutt vs. Petey Williams vs. Kenny King - It should be noted that all the participants in this match are 31 years old in what was a match that started off very fast paced & never let up with each man having his individual moment to shine including Petey working over both men at once such as one bulldogged on top of the other & delivering a running dropkick to one while landing on the other, King's athleticism with high elevated offensive moves including a leaping kick to one on the top one, and Dutt's high flying such as his over the top dives & springboarding off the ropes along with leaping from one side of the turnbuckle to the other.  This was a throwback to the X-Division days of the past where it was non-stop action from start to finish along with each man having a different strategy to win.

Velvet Sky vs. Gail Kim - This started off with some humor as ""the pigeons were let loose"" in an unexpected manner with both girls trading momentum in a match that was pretty short & sweet with both girls having offense focusing on a part of the body.

Over The Top Rope Gauntlet Match: Matt Morgan vs. Joseph Park vs. Shark Boy vs. Johnny Devine vs. Cassidy Reily vs. Robbie E vs. Chase Stevens vs. O.D.B. vs. Johnny Swinger vs. Jessie Godderz vs. Mr. Anderson - This was a ""Royal Rumble"" style of match that could be won by pinfall or submission when it got down to the final two that had certain moments such as Taz on commentary on Sharkboy, teamwork of two individuals that would eventually move on to become tag team champions, and when it got down to the final two.  This was your typical battle royal.

L.A.X. vs. Bad Influence vs. Team 3D - Both L.A.X. & Bad Influence had the same strategy in the beginning as they traded momentum with quick tags & double teaming shutting Team 3D out of the match in the process causing them to make distractions & get involved from the apron along before forcing themselves into the match as each team showcased a different strategy from showcasing superior power advantage to using dirty tactics as the man did eventually break down with all six brawling at one time with one major move executed after another.  This was a fun triple threat match.

Jeff Hardy vs. Austin Aries - Hardy was able to get the mental edge on Aries early on as he kept catching Aries in the same move time after time resulting in him getting so frustrated that he almost walked out of the match only to run back in & get caught again causing Aries to use dirty tactics to get the advantage back with various high elevated elbow drops as both men traded momentum blocking & countering each other's offense while delievering fast paced offense of their own in what turned out to be a competitive match.

James Storm vs. Bobby Roode - Roode started off attempting to play ""cat & mouse"" while Storm resorted to brawling on the outside including using a fan's water bottle causing Roode to slow the pace down grounding Storm working over the head & neck as both men went back & forth with impactful moves like the spinebuster & codebreaker while Storm working over Roode's head & neck area as well.  Roode & Storm just have natural chemistry & I don't recall a bad match between both men with this being no exception.

Samoa Joe vs. Kurt Angle - Angle came into this match with his leg taped as both men started out trading leverage holds working over the head & wrist while also both men exchanging strikes against each other in & out of the ring such as a leg lariat & overhead suplex with effects of the match being shown on both men as they traded momentum with both men exchanging big moves along with counters & reversals including tradeoffs of various different submissions.  This followed the same trend as the previous two matches where they never had a bad match against each other with this being no exception as it was a competitive match between both men.

In the end, this was a good wrestling show from top to bottom that I recommend checking out.",1389225600,,4573,4.506038647342995
