6565663,5,B00MA15AIO,"Really very good.definitely one of the better Zappa Biography dvd's..lots of Flo and Eddie, great speaking parts by Ian Underwood, George Duke and Ansley Dunbar.check it out!",1416528000,,174,5.481481481481482
6565664,4,B00MA15AIO,"Two hours and thirty seven minutes. That is the length of this documentary on what Frank Zappa got into between the years 1969 and 1973. There's lots of information to digest as this covers his disbandment of the original Mothers; his work with jazz musicians for his solo LPs which brands him a pioneer of the '70's jazz-rock fusion; his efforts to bring 200 Motels to the screen and the creation of the Flo & Eddie Mothers. This movie is loaded with lots of photos and video footage (mostly taken from earlier Honker Home Videos), scads of in-depth interviews with former associates and bandmates, and some nice excerpted concert footage during those years. The interviews are with personnel like Aynsley Dunbar, Jeff SImmons, George Duke, Mark Volman, Ian Underwood, Don Preston etc. For the most part they are interesting and kept rather light hearted. I would recommend this to the Zappaphile and the casual fan as it does paint an interesting picture of his life at that time. This DVD is by no means the definitive Zappa documentary but it is a nice piece of work that alot of thought and research went into. There is also a bonus 10m. interview with former bandmates describing their favorite incident while ""on the road"".  This package is worth the $$ so don't be hesitant.",1413072000,62,1282,4.774774774774775

6565667,5,B00MA15AIO,"I really enjoyed this documentary. I learned a lot about the band. I recommend it to anyone interested in the band and how it evolved over the years. The only down side is that a lot of great clips are shown, but most of these are terribly cut up. I think that if these clips were shown in their entirety as bonus extras, this DVD would be perfect. An example of this is a clip of a young Jean Luc Ponty. It is the only video of JLP in my collection and I have been trying hard and failing for 40 years to collect any video of JLP. There is a lot of excellent video of Zappa in concert with Flo and Eddie. I wish I could buy these entire concerts.",1452556800,,647,3.946564885496183
6565668,3,B00MA15AIO,This is stuffed full of archival footage and great interviews.  Unfortunately the narrator speaks in a ridiculous british accent with a phlegmy post-nasal drip quality that's difficult to listen to.,1451692800,,198,5.6
6565669,5,B00MA15AIO,"Insightful, engaging production that gets into the nitty gritty of a very particular period of Zappa's by the folks that were there!  Excellent.",1449792000,,144,5.260869565217392
6565670,5,B00MA15AIO,Must have historical collection of THE MAN.,1448928000,,43,5.285714285714286
6565671,4,B00MA15AIO,"Good account of the years between the end of the Mothers Of Invention in 1969, through the Hot Rats/Chunga's Revenge period of 1970, the Flo and Eddie era, and the jazz of 1972 when Zappa was in a wheelchair.  A few factual inaccuracies are redeemed by great interviews with Ian Underwood, Aynsley Dunbar, Mark Volman and the late George Duke amongst others.  One big gripe for me was the use of Zappa sound-alike background music under the voice over.  Other non-authorised docos have gotten around the Family Trust by not using music at all, a much better decision in my opinion.  Overall though, a good piece well produced and work watching.",1447804800,,644,4.774774774774775

6565677,5,B00MA15AIO,Most unauthorized DVD stories are unmitigated trash this is great. It tells the story of Frank's Bizzare period with interviews of band members and writers. It is in depth and intelligent. Mark Volman Ian Underwood Aynsley Dunbar Ben Watson etc. tell the story. 2 1/2 hours of very interesting information about a very interesting man. Of course since this is unauthorized the only music you get is fair use snipets. That's OK it's a story not a concert video. For that we need the Zappa Family Trust if they ever get off their butts. There is plenty of video available,1425340800,2,569,4.7

6565683,5,B00MA15AIO,"some of the clips are way too short, but the commentary is excellent. the info from all the people contributing (volman, underwood, dunbar, george duke) is wonderful. I rate this better than any of the many zappa DVDs I own. funny how the zappa estate have not authorized it. from hot rats to grand wazoo, it is really worth getting.",1417392000,,333,4.566666666666666

8671113,5,B00MA15AIO,"As a huge fan of FZ I had to have this video. Received it very quickly. I am a sucker for a documentary and especially one about FZ. It is not from the Zappa Family Trust BUT do not let that stop you from making the purchase. It is a very well done doc and if you are a fan you will like it. If I am not mistaken this was made by the same folks who did ""Frank Zappa and the Mothers Of Invention in the 60's"". You should order both. The price is well worth it.",1453420800,2,459,3.693877551020408
