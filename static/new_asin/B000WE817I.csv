I highly recommend this teaching tool to everyone from pastors, teachers, and to laypeople wanting to know how to use The Law when preaching the Gospel to the unsaved.  Wonderful work!

8222956,5,B000WE817I,"Best, -one of the most important teaching/messages you should hear.  There are too many deceived people in churches who have been given a ""false assurance of salvation.""  Someone has lied to them, assuring them they are saved, even though they don't feel any different and are still struggling, caught in the trap of sin.  Hell's Best Kept Secret will help you understand what being saved really means, and what a ""Christian"" really is.  WITH JESUS we CAN live a holy life, and with the Holy Spirit's powerwe CAN get out of ALL the traps of sin that enslave us.  The devil wants to keep you imprisonedin your sin, for the rest of your life, so that -you won't have any power.to be a true witness for Christ or to help others.  God can't use youwhile you are still ensnared;  He first wants to set you FREE.  Jesus suffered and died for YOUproviding the WAYto show you how to be FREE OUT of your sin.  He gives you the desire and His power, to live a whole NEW LIFE.  -Look for preachers who are teaching this.  Ray Comfort's materials will help, and also others who have been saved/changed.by God.  -Look for the ones God is using/speaking through.  God will lead you to holiness, righteousness, repentance.  -And no it's never ""boring"" or ""religious"" -God takes you on the greatest journey of your LIFE-every day is different, fresh and New, because once you ask Him in your life, He will work on growing you every year.  It's challenging, exciting!  God bless you.!",1490659200,3,1467,4.6061776061776065
