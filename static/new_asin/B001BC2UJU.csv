8282643,5,B001BC2UJU,The previous reveiw is correct with any of bill holmes videos. My opinion on why his videos jump around and show diffrent guns and parts is time constraints and probrably a focus on a persons attention span on watching a long video with alot of borring work. I think he shows many test fires because it may give the person who bought the video a more feel of worth seeing the end result of a long process. He does suggest that one way to learn gunsmithing is through practice if you are a beginner or take a gunsmithing class first. I have almost collected his set of videos and books and there is alot of information left to the imagination (if you are a biginner). I think he gives you just enough to figure the rest out on your own. I feel confident if I had the equiptment to follow through I would have no problem completeing any of his work. Learning from his works is a long and expensive process but I think its very possible to accomplish any of his work. You really have to put some effort and finance behind your passion to understand. Bill Holmes gives enough information in his works to bridge any gap that isn't covered in his videos and books and if you cant bridge the gap then just keep asking qualified people till you feel you have the answer you need.,1298505600,,1271,4.322175732217573
8282644,1,B001BC2UJU,"In my opinion this video is a absolute waste of money. I was expecting maybe a couple of hours of how-to's for building the guns from start to finish, well nope. This video will show you a very few of the more difficult procedures which will only make sense if you own all of the other books first. For example, why would I care about the 9mm bolt if I owned the .22 book, or the carbine sights if I owned the 9mm pistol book. It's a mix-match of different projects being shown done without a single one being shown start to finish. I don't know why this would be, I'm guessing perhaps some legal issues involving the building of the guns, but surely the video producers could have foreseen those issues and advised the viewers as such and found a way to work around them, but no attempt to do so was clearly made, which I'm guessing why the video again doesn't have a start-to-finish project shown. I was deeply disappointed, this video is 43 minutes long and about 5-10 minutes is shown test firing different guns and showing the different magazines, which is great, but would have been better had the techniques to make those magazines and guns been shown. I understand in the current political climate there exists a movement to demonize gun owners and anyone wanting to exercise their 2nd amendment, clearly this video is the embodiment of those beliefs showing nothing of real substance, but trying to fool one into thinking it would.",1274313600,4,1440,4.5852713178294575
