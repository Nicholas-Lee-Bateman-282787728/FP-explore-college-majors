8156428,5,B000KGGIY6,"Two great movies in one package. If your a Gene Hackman fan, this double feature is a must. A great price as well!",1382054400,,114,4.0
8156429,5,B000KGGIY6,"The first time I watched this movie, I was constantly trying to figure what was going on.  After watching it the 3rd time, it is still as intriguing and mytifying as the first time.  Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman and John Cusak keep this a real nail-biter of a thriller suspense film.  You know something is going on, but can never put your finger on it....til the end.  It is packed with intrigue, danger, and pulse-pounding twists.  Runaway Jury Rules!!!!",1352937600,2,456,4.7215189873417724
8156430,3,B000KGGIY6,"If I hadn't read the book first, I would have been clueless. Which is not to say that there were not  some stellar performances from the cast. This is the usual case, book to movie - lost in translation.",1284681600,,203,4.205128205128205
8156431,5,B000KGGIY6,"I came across the move Runaway Jury one night.
I found it so interesting I did not leave
the room for fear of missing something,  I
had to see the whole movie and ordered it and
much to my surprise the movie came in a two
movie pack.  Class Action is also a terrific
show.",1282348800,,272,3.9272727272727272
