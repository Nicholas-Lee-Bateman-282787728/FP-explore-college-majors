6261271,5,B00IER1G7M,We received this set complete and in good time. I went to Chilli for breakfast and Panama for lunch and I will leave dinner to your imagination.. Its all in fun and you will arrive with in moments rather then hours or days. Globe Trekker is always great fun and every episode is commercial free and around 60 minutes.,1399680000,2,317,4.389830508474576

8641642,4,B00IER1G7M,"Ian Wright and others do a wonderful job of showing how to travel on a small budget through South America.  Frankly, some of these ladies and gentlemen braved going into parts that many people would avoid.  But remarkably they found many other adventurous (and mostly young) people already there sharing their travels.

Some of the filmography is a bit clich, almost looking like something shot in the 1970's.

But all of the travelers sample the cuisine, talk to the local people, exchange travel tips, walk through the markets and overall do a very good job of showing the diversity of the various countries that they visit.  It gives you the feeling of actually being there, and is not some stodgy narrative just showing you the outside of buildings. Locations range from carnival in Rio, to the Andes, the Amazon, a Welsh enclave in Argentina, jungle and mountain trails to Machu Picchu, dodgy locations in Columbia, and deep in the earth in a Peruvian silver mine.

 And each of the narrators has an enthusiasm for their ventures that makes you just want to grab your passport and go, even if you only made to half the places they show. This is definitely worth watching.",1434240000,2,1176,4.763546798029557
8641643,4,B00IER1G7M,"With Ian Wright, be sure to preview before you show it to a class.  I use this for my Spanish class and stop it before Ian Wright shows his nude backside at the end of one segment.  There is no need for such vulgarity. Otherwise, it is a good way to present Latin America and its culture to Spanish Students.",1430265600,3,308,4.116666666666666

8641645,5,B00IER1G7M,"I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but the Bolivia and Ecuador episodes were phenomenal.  I felt like I was in Ecuador watching the episode!  Be careful if you plan to show this at school- there are a few scenes in the Bolivia episode that will need previewing- such as streaking through the closing credits...  I'm sure there are more in the other DVDs!",1417651200,5,359,4.578125
