So many people are looking for ""a secret"" to have a magical way of getting ahead in life, but we all know that there is nothing new under the sun.  This DVD is a great resource to unwrap the veil of The Secret book, letting us know the true source of success.

Want to be successful in your life?  Be a builder; build your relationships, build your career, build your knowledge, build your faith, and build others up!",1217808000,17,491,4.247311827956989

Not only is the outside of the packaging deliberately made to look like ""The Secret"" but even the imagery used for the background of the speakers looks very much like the bestseller's. This film markets itself as a continuation or expansion of the teachings of ""The Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne. But make no mistake, it is most certainly not.

One of its first messages is that one is naive for believing that the ""Laws of Attraction"" are truly as simple as they are. Then it begins to press the message that religion is what will truly bring one happiness.

I have the audiobook for ""The Secret"" and love it. It is an uplifting book that gives a message hope and optimism, regardless of religion or faith. I personally found it when I needed it most. I found it exciting to think that there would be a movie expanding on the concepts in the book and was sorely disappointed. I think it is disheartening that people would take advantage of such a positive thing that is currently successful, and distort it to force their options on others.",1215993600,7,1104,4.5376884422110555

I bought this DVD thinking that it would be an expansion on ""The Secret"" DVD that focuses on The Law of Attraction.  It focuses on it, all right...in a negative way.

You'll notice on this page that there is no product description.  The packaging of this DVD baits you into thinking that it will reinforce the teachings of The Secret.  The back cover description vaguely describes the content material.  It's only when you start to view the feature that you realize how ""religion"" is at the center of this DVD.  Please take note that I use the word ""religion"" in quotation marks.  I am not a religious person, I AM a spiritual person.  I find my spirituality from within and do NOT need an exterior source for enlightenment.  This DVD insists that you MUST search outside yourself for what you need to live life with love and joy.

While viewing this program, I went from eager to squeamish to disrespected.  At the chapter start entitled ""What is The Source of the Secret?"", I was told that ""The Source"" was ""...our lord, Jesus Christ.""  At this point, dear friends, the DVD player was stopped, the disc went back into the case, and I returned my copy to the Barnes and Noble from whence it came.

3133520,2,B0014L5536,"As a huge fan of ""The Secret"" and a person that USED to be a Christian and renounced it when I discovered the last thing Christians actually do is Follow Christ. (It's not really their fault as the Bible has been twisted and used to control and enslave people.)

But the Fact is Jesus who I have great love and respect for DID teach ""The Secret"" and the Law of attraction. But most Christians are too busy resisting Sin (even though Jesus said ""Resist not Evil"" and trying to keep from going to hell and get to Heaven (A masterful way to keep people dis-empowered out of the NOW) to bother to actually understand and follow what he taught for use in this life NOW!

This DVD wants to point out that the source of manifestation is GOD and not you. But that is actually not correct. The Message Jesus brought was that ""Know ye Not that ye are little Gods"" and ""Great is he that is in you than he that is in the world"", ""Christ in your is your hope of Glory"", ""I and my father are one"", ""The things I do you can do also and greater things."" Does it not say in the Bible ""Be Still and Know That I am GOD."" That's a meditation for the oneness with God knowing that ""I AM GOD"" Meaning you and your father are one.

Instead of Realizing that they are the Source of their manifestations BECAUSE THEY ARE GOD at their deepest level, and that every thing is also GOD, and choosing what they want and focusing their though and faith to manifest it they choose to Pray to Jesus to grant their prayers, which he Never said to do! Or Pray To God asking to grant their request. But if you clearly follow what Jesus Christ did and said that is NOT how he prayed or instructed us to pray.

You can think that GOD is the source of all things but understand that you shape and mold your life with your thought and feelings and his laws create it for you if that works better for you. But that view point still creates separation from oneness with GOD.

This is why most Christian teachings that come from this incorrect viewpoint are flawed from their inception. When you start seeing your self as one with GOD and all things as being one with GOD, you no longer are limited and can manifest anything you desire.

The sad part is after about 40 years of Christian Study some of them start to understand, when they could have found the ""The Secret"" or some other source that has not be edited and perverted to control people and enslave them and applied it to their lives and had joyous lives. If there is Joy GOD is there is matters not who the message comes from if you doubt that realize that GOD spoke though Burning bushes, and even Donkeys.",1243468800,7,2626,4.25250501002004

In reading the other reviews I see a number of people who feel as though they were misled about the subject of the this DVD.

I think that I can understand why; this DVD is not a continuation of The Secret which they believed it would be. Also, where The Secret is not presented with a strong religious affiliation, this DVD is, mostly, but not exclusively, presented with a christian perspective.

One of the strengths, I think, of The Secret is that it does not take any preference of any particular faith; what it proclaims works for any and all. But it does not, I think, exclude faith or God. Remember that Gratitude, expressing true heartfelt thanks, is a key element of what is called The Law of Attraction (LOA). It is my belief, and I think the point of the producers of this DVD that those thanks are to be directed to God. In short the creators of this DVD are saying that the Source of the Secret, or Law of Attraction is God.

The people who are presented here in the DVD do not dismiss the LOA, they simply want credit directed to where it is due. Further they warn that if your sole desire is to amass vast sums of material wealth you may not find the happiness you think that you will find in possessing all those things.

It starts off speaking rather positive of the LOA, then kinda steps back - scoffing at but not entirely dismissing the notion, just saying that it aint really just you directing the the universe to give you what you want. It does take strong issue as well with the concept that we invite bad things into our lives merely by our thoughts, citing as examples the Holocaust and 9/11, among others.

There are some parts of the views presented in this film which I do not hold as my own, but I think that its heart is in the right place; I do not think that it is intended to be deceptive or to ambush your beliefs.

I can accept its premise that we can not take sole credit for the fortunes in our lives, but, IMHO, I don't think that it gives us enough credit either.",1230249600,10,2141,4.245700245700245

However, it was a big, big trap and you fell on it because they knew you would be caught by it's title and cover.

It not only twists the words on the original bestseller but it also makes many, many negative statements and in the end they say ""...but the Lord Jesus will help you, not The Secret. You have no power, but Jesus have"".

It's layout and background are copies from the original The Secret. You can clearly see that it is made by another production company, one that is deeply interested in profits and only allows you to watch the content by buying it. The Secret on the other hand has the original movie and all the contents from the DVD for you to watch online and for FREE on their website and even links to download it to your computer for free. And it's funny that this movie keeps saying that money and things are bad, but thats what they want in the bottom line.

Yup, after watching 3 chapters and getting very disappointed about how I was starting to feel I took the DVD out of the player and immediately found a new useful thing to do with it. I turned it into an ashtray cause I really needed one. So, it was good in a way. It deserves at least one star for becoming my ashtray. Returning it to Best Buy would only make another ""The Secret"" fan and curious person disappointed so I saved someone's time and money. For that maybe it deserves 2 stars but it was my time and money that I wasted on it so I'm not even giving them that.

The cover and the disc makes it a very alternative and beautiful ashtray, you can close it and it looks just like a normal DVD case so it's not as ugly as a normal ashtray. For the producers and everyone involved on this DVD I have to say: Thank you, my friends loved the idea of turning this into an ashtray and they also did that with old DVD cases and CD cases. I will start selling DVD cases as an ashtray now, simple, discreet and you can also change the cover when you get tired of that one. Put beautiful pictures of nature, family, friends. It's awesome.

Please ignore the negative reviews and have an open mind when watching this movie. People today seem to get very uncomfortable when anything about religion or God is brought up. I totally understand because of the people in life that go about religion the wrong way and try to force it on everyone else instead of simply teaching its teachings. Its easy for people to shut religion out because of this reason.

Nobody is going to have the same exact beliefs about anything and religion is the same. If you took a whole church of Catholics none of them are going to believe the same exact things about every single detail. They will however have a similar way of thinking, just like people with sucess in they're lives. I personally am a believer in God. Does that mean the everyone who is sucessful has to believe in God? No! But I feel that you should believe in something or someone that is greater that the human race if not God himself.

In fact, Dr. Ben Johnson (in this DVD) was in the original Secret movie. There is also one more scholar here who was interviewed by Rhonda for The Secret. but was later cut out, as was Jerry and Esther Hicks.
Anyway. This DVD (The Source of the Secret) just proposes that there is more to the Secret and the Law of Attraction than your own mind control. It just says that the real true source of getting what you want out of life comes from within, from a higher power, YOUR higher power. God, by the way, was even mentioned SEVERAL times in the original Secret, and no one was offended there.
Why, all of a sudden, is everyone offended when God was mentioned in THIS new DVD?

Nobody is going to have the same exact beliefs about anything and religion is the same. If you took a whole church of Catholics none of them are going to believe the same exact things about every single detail. They will however have a similar way of thinking, just like people with sucess in they're lives. I personally am a believer in God. Does that mean the everyone who is sucessful has to believe in God? No! But I feel that you should believe in something or someone that is greater that the human race if not God himself. I ask that you just watch the movie and have a open mind and don't shut it out just because they talk about religion.",1225065600,11,1333,4.440816326530612
3368025,5,B0014L5536,"I think most, if not ALL, reviewers here missed the point. This video doesn't discredit Rhonda Byrne, The Secret movie, or the Law of Attraction. In fact, Dr. Ben Johnson (in this DVD) was in the original Secret movie. There is also one more scholar here who was interviewed by Rhonda for The Secret. but was later cut out, as was Jerry and Esther Hicks.
Anyway. This DVD (The Source of the Secret) just proposes that there is more to the Secret and the Law of Attraction than your own mind control. It just says that the real true source of getting what you want out of life comes from within, from a higher power, YOUR higher power. God, by the way, was even mentioned SEVERAL times in the original Secret, and no one was offended there.
Why, all of a sudden, is everyone offended when God was mentioned in THIS new DVD?

Bottom line, I saw BUY THIS, and watch it with an open mind and open heart, and you will NOT be disappointed.",1219622400,15,933,4.331428571428572

However, The Source pointed out many fallacies in Ronda Byrne's book and DVD. She quoted Jesus' words from the Bible to justify her point of view. She used Mark 11:23, but she excluded the rest of Jesus' wisdom in verses 22, & 24-26. Verse 22 is the most important one because it leads us to the Source of the secret. I practice God's law of attraction along with many of His awesome promises.  The Source is a great documentary for people to think about what they believe and what they fall for without thinking.",1365552000,,654,4.470588235294118
8255994,1,B0014L5536,"The Secret was the first book by Rhonda Byrne. It is definitely inspiring. Although, her book following the Secret, titled The Power, expands even further on its concepts to what you really need in life and the only thing you need in life:love. Like Jesus, Buddha, Gandi, John Lennon, Martin Luther King Jr, and all the rest of the great leaders of our time said, ""Love."" When you love you are able to use the Law of Attraction. The Power is one of the most amazing and inspiring books I have read and may change your life.

This movie pretends to expand on the concepts of the Secret, but really just bashes them. It is hard enough to find in this society a belief that really resonates with you. We are all seeking the truth and there is only one, but the words people use to describe things can really throw you off. If you are a fan of the secret and those words resonate with your heart, do not buy this DVD. It made me extremely unconfortable and I am so dissapointed because very recently things have really come together for me and I have more established beliefs for how I want to live my life. This DVD threw them out of wack, which is the worst feeling. I couldn't even finish it, my body and mind were completely revolting against it.

They still say giving is the key to life, gratefulness, at the core the same concepts of the secret, but they also allude to that fact that God is outside yourself, and seem to be talking about a man in the sky. God is love. God is outside ourselves and within us, and there is only one force of life. It is in all of us. The messages in this DVD are negative and use traditional Christian terms that will throw you off.

Don't buy this DVD! Everything Ben says from the original secret is accurate, but the rest of the guys are not people you want to be listening to. You can tell by the way they look. They are not loving, they are not happy, they are coming from a fearful place, which is not god, because god=love. They are not leaders.",1330646400,2,1988,4.267904509283819
8255995,1,B0014L5536,"""Ah, religion... It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion.""

-Carl Sagan

Before I begin talking about why I really didn't like -this- product, let me preface a bit. This film attempts to tear down the work called, ""The Secret,"" by Rhonda Byrne. The great thing about The Secret is that it teaches in a very grounded, scientific way that is -still- accessible to even extremely religious people, how it is in fact -we- who decide the outcomes of events and circumstances in our lives by the divine power vested in each of us. It is uplifting, it is empowering, and it marks a very clear departure from the destructive social philosophy that divinity is something purely external which we must appease and supplicate if we don't want to suffer. And you know what? That's wonderful. The people who made The Secret among other related films recognize wisely that those ways of thought have us living in needless limitation and misery, and it's time that we as a people did something more life-affirming.

Now, this ""The Source of the Secret"" movie tries to do just the opposite. Many have sought to benefit from causing others to misunderstand and mistrust Byrne's work. The weak minds who created this specific work are trying to drag people back into a past full of self-destructive shame, guilt and fear and self-loathing engendered by over 900 years of superstitious, impractical abrahamic dogma. They are quick to call the teachings of The Secret ""delusional"", ""arrogant"" and ""dogmatic"" while twisting and omitting over half of the most crucial teachings in Byrne's film. They castigate our society's lack of focus on their beliefs and practices in a closed-minded, patronizing tone that could only come from mainstream religion, pointing to lack of belief in xtianity as the source of all our problems. I wonder if any of them ever stopped to think that maybe people are so disenchanted by ""spirituality"" because they can tell that religious superstition has, itself, caused all those problems. As the title suggests, these people claim that the success to be had by using the Law of Attraction (the main topic of ""The Secret"") is dependent upon one's obedience of the laws of -their- god as set forth in -their- bible. ""My God OWNS your law of attraction!"" Oh, grow up...

Anyone with half a brain could see that this is a step backwards. We are not living in the dark ages, and this film is nothing more than a cowardly attempt by those who fear change to re-entrap people in fear, guilt, lack and limitation. How these people can sleep at night, I have no earthly idea, but I'm utterly revolted with this product. I would NOT recommend it to anyone who wants to live in prosperity, wealth or love.

I want to add a quote from Theodore Roosevelt to this review. I think this sums it up nicely...

""It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.""",1316476800,3,3538,4.680064308681672
