2765464,5,B000NDI4VQ,"Richard Egan has always been one of my favorites and there is a great fight scene.  Very good movie, qualifies as a classic.  If you've never seen it you'll never forget it.",1357862400,,173,4.375
2765465,5,B000NDI4VQ,"This movie came out over fifty years ago but is still a great movie with wonderful stars.  Susan Hayward and Tyrone Power - who could ask for more.  The movie is an adventure of the Dutch farmers who leave Cape Colony and cross the Val River into Southern Africa.  They meet the Zulu nation coming down from the north with a bloody outcome ultimately triumphing over the Zulu and the wilderness.  This film predates ""Zulu"" the movie about the battle at Rorke's Drift which was also an exciting film.  Both are highly recommended.",1270944000,,529,4.645161290322581
2765466,2,B000NDI4VQ,"From the stone walls of Ireland to the plains of South Africa, neither Susan Hayward nor Tyrone Power manage an appropriate accent between them, and thus fail to establish credibility at the outset. The story lacks historical context (the Boers were fighting against the British) and after a complicated series of events, resolves itself into a parody of an American Western.

The Cinemascope was fine, but this story could just as easily have been shot in Montana for all the realism it conveyed. Not a shining 112 minutes.",1259107200,,524,4.954545454545454
2765467,4,B000NDI4VQ,"Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward give outstanding performances in this all time classic film. A story of one woman's desire for a man which rules her life from ""rags to riches"" and back again. Lots of great actors in the cast. Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Richard Egan, Rita Moreno, and Agnes Moorehead all give their best. A ""must see"" for any fan of any of these actors or classic movies.",1185667200,7,388,4.557142857142857
2765468,4,B000NDI4VQ,"I read the book Untamed and the sequel The Savage Earth. Loved the movie and it follows the book almost word for word. Except Kurt(Egan) gets both legs cut off and fades from the story completely.

2765469,4,B000NDI4VQ,"Katie O'Neill (Susan Hayward) first meet Paul Van Riebeck (Tyrone Power), a leader of the South African Boers, when he comes to Ireland on a horse-buying trip... The two fall in love, but Paul, intent on establishing a Dutch Free State back home, has no time to settle down and refuses to marry her while he has this commitment...

Several years pass and Katie has wed Shawn Kildare (John Justin). When the great potato famine of the 1850s strikes Ireland, Katie, still in love with Paul, persuades Shawn that they should go to South Africa to start a new life...

They sail with their infant son and his nurse, Aggie (Agnes Moorehead), and in Capetown, join a group of homesteaders on a trek to the interior, where en route, Katie catches the eye of handsome Kurt Hout (Richard Egan), leader of a band of outriders...

A surprise Zulu attack on the wagon train is broken up by the timely appearance of Paul Van Riebeck and his men, but during the fighting, Shawn is killed... Paul does what he can to comfort Katie but finds that Kurt Hout, an old friend, already has made clear his interest in the newly widowed homesteader...

When the wagon train finally reaches its destination, Hoffen Valley, Katie convinces Paul to settle down with her, but their happiness is short-lived... Paul leaves to continue his work with the Free State movement, unaware that Katie is carrying his child...

Kurt, very upset for not being desired, becomes a dangerous outlaw, enemy of the authority... Rita Moreno plays his mistress...

Katie is the example of the brave intelligent, ambitious, lucky lady... She proves her courage, persistence and full determination to win as a wife, a mother, and a woman in love...

Filmed in the ""grandeur"" of CinemaScope, ""Untamed"" is a romantic action melodrama, short in action and long on romance...

The role of Kurt Hout was originally intended for Victor Mature, but he was replaces by Richard Egan...",1182211200,32,1929,4.824242424242424
2765498,4,B000NDI4VQ,"This could easily be titled ""Cowboy in Africa"" because the plot can easily be transferred to the Old West. Perhaps it's really a recycled western (which was not unusual for the studio system). The chemistry between Susan Hayward and Tyrone Power is electrifying. I enjoyed them together in ""Rawhide"" so I bought this DVD thinking that it would be another good pairing for them. I wasn't disappointed.",1467849600,2,400,4.985074626865671
2765499,1,B000NDI4VQ,"Given today's technology, no widescreen movie should ever be released in a Letterboxed version.  This is a widescreen format within a 4:3 frame.  The result is a small rectangle with fat black borders top and bottom, left and right.  If its not anamorphic widescreen, why bother to release it?  I and many others do not have a zoom feature on the DVD/Bluray player nor on the TV, so I can only stretch it horizontally.  Zooming brings out the poor resolution of this format type anyway, and should never have to be used.

A big company like Fox should have a little pride in what they are doing.  This was a major production, so shame on the person at Fox that made the stupid decision to release this as it is.  Unfortunately, it will have to go back.  Thanks for wasting some of my time, Fox.",1466726400,4,794,4.4206896551724135

2765540,3,B000NDI4VQ,"If you're a big fan of Susan Hayward, you will love Untamed.  If you are a big fan of Tyrone Power, this is not the film for you.  Power was anxious to finish his contract with 20th Century Fox, which more or less he was strong-armed him into signing after the war, so he did this film to finish his commitment to them. Originally it was to star Robert Mitchum, who apparently just never bothered showing up.  This is really a Susan Hayward vehicle, in my opinion.

The story is like Scarlett O'Hara in South Africa, as Katie loves, loses, suffers, and fights as she and her husband settle in South Africa after the Irish potato famine. Katie's agenda is clear: her true love, Paul Van Riebeck (Tyrone Power) is there.  He is a leader of the South African Boers, but his desire to establish a Dutch Free State took precedence when they first fell in love, and he felt he could not marry her. They meet again during a wagon train attack by Zulus. Her husband is killed, and Paul sees that his friend Kurt (Richard Egan) is interested in Katie, so he backs off.
There is more unhappiness ahead for Katie.

Not one of my favorite films, but a good cast, including besides Power, Hayward, and Egan, Agnes Moorhead and Rita Moreno who gets to yell a terrible line. Referring to Richard Egan, who has lost one leg, she cries out: ""THE REST OF HIM IS MINE!""

Thus, Tyrone Power could leave Fox knowing that he had been used and abused to the end.",1435708800,,1439,4.387218045112782

I was still able to zoom the movie and it came up quite good. The actual print is pretty decent and very watchable. As I am a collector of classic movies this is a good one to have in your library. Once again i ask fox to be able to produce these old classics in the correct ratio as Warner archive do .if this was to happen i would be the first to purchase them .Fox always had fine prints of the old classics ,so I cannot see why fox would not change there strategies and produce some good quality prints I am sure they wold have some good sales.

Of course, this wonderful adventure yarn set in South Africa directed by the great ( and sadly forgotten  now ) Henry KING, should deserve a 16/9 anamorphic version, but nevertheless, the image is quite good, and we have a full stereophonic sound, adding greatness to the beautiful and inspired music of Franz WAXMAN.

2765620,4,B000NDI4VQ,"I had not had good luck with other 20th Century Fox archives wide screen films as they were released panned and scanned. I finally saw this at a low price and purchased it. When the film started a disclamier came on saying ""This film has been modified from it's original form. It has been formatted to fit your screen"". I groaned and thought I had wasted my money. Then the film came on if full widescreen, and except for the colors being a little faded, the print is great.

In 1847 Irish Katie O'Neill (Susan Hayward) meets south african Paul Van Ribeck (Tyrone Power) when he comes to Ireland to buy horses. A romance starts but Paul has to return to South Africa to tyr and establish a Dutch free state. He is also a commander of the commandos, a guerilla fight group. He feels he can't think about a family as along as he is leading the hard life he leads. A few years pass and Katie marries Shawn Kildare (John Justin). The have to leave Ireland for land in South Africa to escape the horrible potato famine that has hit ireland and is killing hundreds of thousands from starvation and on the ocean voyage trip have a child.

The are part of a large wagon train that goes to the interior and Katie catches the eye of Kurt Hout (Richard Egan), one of Paul's best friends although it's not something she welcomes. The train is attacked by a very large group of Zulus in a very large scale and well staged battle sequence and the train is in danger of being overwhelmed when Paul and his commandos arrive to save the day. Shawn though has been killed in the battle. Paul and his commandos stay with the train until they arrive at their destination and along the way Katie and Paul reconnect and Katie realizes she never really lost her feelings for Paul. This angers Kurt which lead to a bull whip duel between the two men.

Paul tries to settle down but just can't and leaves Katie expecting his child although he doesn't know. Kurt offers himself again to Katie but she doesn't love him and he is showing a very dark side to his personality. He loses his leg in a tragic accident and this lead to his downward spiral to the head of a large outlaw gang. Katie's farm is destroyed in a bad storm but she comes into possession of the largest diamond every found in South Africa and for a while she lives the life a a very wealthy woman in Cape Town. Ther she reconnects with Paul, he discovers he has a child but leaves again (duty over family). Eventually Katie runs out of money and returns to the town near her farm which has been taken over by Kurt's gang and there is a final confrontation between Paul and Kurt.

This is a well acted film done on a very big scale. It has action but is mainly a melodrama, a good one though and I'm happy to have it in my collection. The on location scenes done in South Africa are beautiful and the score by Franz Waxman ins great. My only complaint is the climax. The Zulu attack on the wagon train is on such a large scale, and goes on for about 8 to 10 minutes, that the final shoot out, while well done, seems small and somewhat anti-climatic in comparison.",1385510400,,3103,4.317324185248713

= the movie is on the DVD in its 2.55:1 original Format (black bars above and down of the screen) but... when you've a 16:9 TV so you have to use the zoom button = then the movie shows correct.

Sound is pretty well in Stereo and the picture quality is good too. It could just a little bit sharper but fine so far. But for a Tyrone Power movie I would prefer to see this movie on Blu-Ray in very good quality.

2765667,4,B000NDI4VQ,"This Gone With The Wind-style romance of a fiery Irish redhead who survives many tribulations in 19th Century South Africa is one of Susan Hayward's better period movies of the '50's. (In fact, compared to THE CONQUEROR, it's akin to CITIZEN KANE). Re-teamed with Tyrone Power, who had starred with her in RAWHIDE, Susan Hayward applies her considerable histrionic talent and intelligence to a somewhat enigmatic and unlikeable character, gaining sympathy which a lesser actress would not be able to elicit.
  Able support is provided by Agnes Moorehead ( who never gave an uninteresting performance) and Richard Egan. UNTAMED is another CinemaScope Opus which showed the movie-going public location vistas of Africa on the wider canvas which temporarily revitalized Hollywood in the mid-'50's.
  The best feature of this movie is Franz Waxman's great score (available on CD from Film Score Monthly), which should be heard in stereo. This release will be in Wide Screen (2.55:1, non-anamorphic- ie. Letterboxed,you will need to set your Wide TV to 'Zoom' to see it at its best) but no indication is given as to whether it will be in some kind of stereo. (The Spanish release was-regrettably- mono, which is not an encouraging sign). It was originally released in 4-track Magnetic surround sound, but - in general-Fox are not going to much trouble with their MOD releases, so the best we can hope for would be 2-track stereophonic sound.)
  Franz Waxman- whose scores inc. REBECCA,SUNSET BOULEVARD, A PLACE IN THE SUN- resigned from the Academy in protest over the non-nomination of Alfred Newman's groundbreaking score for THE ROBE in 1954. Despite the high quality of his compositions for Hollywood movies after this (egs. PEYTON PLACE, HEMINGWAY'S ADVENTURES OF A YOUNG MAN,SAYONARA, PRINCE VALIANT) his nominations were suspiciously few and far between. (Not that I'm saying that the Academy is ever political in its voting!)UNTAMED was worthy of a nomination for Best Original Score ,and as critic William Hamilton said of CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE, another Tyrone Power/Fox epic with a great (Alfred Newman)score:""It's a picture whose music makes it worth seeing twice""",1371168000,18,2169,5.236311239193084
2765668,1,B000NDI4VQ,"This was an exciting film in CinemaScope and another re-pairing of Susan Hayward & Tyrone Power. And once again, the Fox Cinema Archives is releasing this in the horrible Pan & Scan version. This ruins the scope of the movie and is not worth having. Shame! Shame! Shame! I'm very disappointed.",1370563200,33,293,4.764705882352941

8177162,1,B000NDI4VQ,There is no reason why in 2013 a DVD of a Cinemascope widescreen movie should be produced in a non-anamorphic letterbox format. 16X9 flat screen TVs are the norm today. The film source seems like it is in good shape but it can't be appreciated with this outdated video format. 20th Century-Fox really dropped the ball on this DVD. I'm hoping that Kino or Twilight Time will produce a Blu-ray that will finally do this film justice.,1510358400,,431,4.6103896103896105
