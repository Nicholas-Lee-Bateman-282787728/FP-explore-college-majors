TITLE:  Sam Goldwyn Movie Collection (Vol. II)  NR  11:44:58

  First, let me apologize in advance for the length of this review. <rant> Since Amazon changed its review policy to display ONLY ""Verified Purchases"" (unless you jump through some hoops to see the ""un-Verified Purchases""), and since they also don't recognize an individual movie as having come from a box-set that you purchased (and, therefore, is marked as NOT a ""Verified Purchase""), I no longer post separate individual reviews for EACH movie in a box-set. I spend too much time composing my reviews to, then, have them thrown into a digital black hole  just because Amazon can't figure out that I did, indeed, purchase (from them) the movie that I'm writing about! </rant>

  Anyway, this is another adequate movie collection (with two GREAT movies [""Stella Dallas"" and ""Dead End""], two DECENT movies [""The Westerner"" and ""They Got Me Covered""], and two BARELY SO-SO movies [""The Princess and the Pirate"" and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""]). It could have been an EXCELLENT movie collection by replacing the barely so-so ""The Princess and the Pirate"" and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" with the EXCELLENT ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""The Bishop's Wife"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samuel-Goldwyn-Collection-Vol-I/dp/B00DDNMQJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samuel Goldwyn Collection (Vol I)</a>&nbsp;(which I also bought JUST for those two movies). Oh well. The studios know that if they put all of the good movies together, then nobody would buy the leftover ""junk"" that they would then be forced to put together in other collections.

  See my review of each movie below, and the other reviews on this page for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movies.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  (See Each Movie below for its Bit-Rate and Color Information)  480p  MPEG-2

  Within the confines of the DVD format, each film exhibits at least very good (and, sometimes, excellent) picture quality. Warner Home Video has done a very-good to great job of re-mastering each film, because there are very few discernible instances of artifacts such as black specks and white dots. Nor do I recall seeing many occurrences of hair-lines or dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for DVD's) are VERY good  with textures of most clothing and furnishings being readily apparent. Lastly, contrast and gray scale (again, for DVD's) are very-good overall, and in some movies, even excellent (""Dead End"" and ""The Westerner"" being prime examples). Overall, the picture quality of these discs is very pleasing.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital (See Each Movie below for its Number of Channels)  (48 KHz, 192 Kbps)

  Each movie has a monophonic soundtrack in either Dolby Digital 1.0 or Dolby Digital 2.0 (dual-mono) format, that features dialog that is usually very clear, with all voices being easily understood. However, dynamic range is limited in each soundtrack, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of in each case (which makes the musical scores and the sound effects of each movie sound a little 'thin' and less than convincing). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements for each film and the fact that all six movies are monophonic and dialog-driven, the audio presentation of each film has, at least, acceptable sound quality.

EXTRAS: (See Each Movie below for a more detailed list of its ""Extras"")

  None of the extras were reviewed.

  ======================

  Stella Dallas (1925)  NR  1:50:00 [Disc 1]
  Ronald Colman, Belle Bennett, Alice Joyce, Jean Hersholt
  Henry King (Director)

  MOVIE: ?.?

  If I ever watch this version, then I'll come back and update the rating information. (Sorry, I'm not much of a silent movie fan.)

  VIDEO: 2.? (1.33:1  B&W [4.7 Kbps])

  I haven't watched this movie all the way through (and, probably never will)  however, the little sample viewing that I have done thus far, has exposed an image that was obviously created from a VERY damaged source print (which is understandable, given the age of the movie). The image has low contrast, isn't very sharp, and has MANY instances of lines, specs and dropped frames.

  AUDIO: N/A (Dolby Digital 2.0 [48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  This movie does NOT have a soundtrack AT ALL  it is truly a silent movie. Every other silent movie that I have ever watched (admittedly, not many) has had, at least, some type of generic musical accompaniment  but NOT this one (which makes me wonder why they dedicated TWO channels of 192 kilobits-per-second Dolby Digital ""audio"" to it).

  EXTRAS: This movie IS an extra on the ""Stella Dallas"" disc.

  ----------------------

  Stella Dallas (1937)  NR  1:45:35 [Disc 1]
  Barbara Stanwyck, John Boles, Anne Shirley, Alan Hale
  King Vidor (Director)

  MOVIE: 5.0

  This movie (along with ""Dead End"" [each of which is available separately, with each costing NEARLY as much as this ENTIRE 6-disc collection]) is the reason that I purchased this boxed-set. Yeah, at times, it's a little hokie (and, sometimes, more than a little)  but, so what. This is one of the first great ""weepies"", that set the stage for such later gems as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodbye-Mr-Chips-1939/dp/B00EOBB866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939)</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Victory-1939/dp/B00UJMW9ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Victory (1939)</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Miniver-1942/dp/B009CUW2IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Miniver (1942)</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Random-Harvest-1942/dp/B0006B2AA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Random Harvest (1942)</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughly-Speaking-1945/dp/B002IC1EUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughly Speaking (1945)</a>""  all of which, while not necessarily sharing the same plot elements, nonetheless have the overarching themes of dedication, selfless love and (often, great) loss. Watching this movie ALWAYS makes me think of my mother, and then I have to reach for the Kleenex (particularly since she has passed away), as I remember how her love, her dedication and her many sacrifices enriched my life and enabled me to become the person that I am today  the good parts were ALL your doing mom, the bad parts I picked up ENTIRELY on my own. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  VIDEO: 4.4 (1.33:1  B&W [5.1 Kbps])

  This film exhibits very good picture quality. There are NO artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines or dropped frames. Also, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are VERY good  with the textures and patterns of most clothing and furnishings being easily discernible. Lastly, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are VERY good overall, and in many scenes, even excellent. Overall, the picture quality of this movie is very-good (and, on occasion, even excellent [for a DVD])  and, it should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest viewers.

  AUDIO: 2.5 (Dolby Digital 2.0 [Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  This movie has a monophonic soundtrack that is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 format. It features dialog that is usually clear, with all voices being easily understood. However, dynamic range is limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end of which to speak (which makes the musical score and the Foley work sound a little 'thin' and less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements for this film  and the fact that it is monophonic and dialog-driven  its audio presentation has acceptable sound quality.

  EXTRAS: Silent 1925 version of ""Stella Dallas"" [See Above]

  ----------------------

  Dead End (1937)  NR  1:31:48 [Disc 2]
  Sylvia Sidney, Joel McCrea, Humphrey Bogart, Wendy Barrie
  William Wyler (Director)

  MOVIE: 5.0

  When watching this movie (as should be the case when watching ANY ""old"" movie), try NOT to evaluate it from a perspective of today's values and sensibilities. Try to think of it in the context of its era  which, in this case, is 1930s America. A 1930s America that was deeply ensconced in the throes of the Great Depression (a depression that had upwards of 25 percent unemployment, and, which made our recent ""Great Recession"" of 2008 look like a picnic in comparison). This was an America where the VAST majority of people did NOT have telephones. An America where most people, since broadcast television (for all practical purposes) hadn't even been invented yet, derived the MAJORITY of their entertainment from radio (and AM radio, at that). An America that moved the VAST majority of its people and goods via trains and rail systems  because it did NOT yet have a modern nationwide interstate highway system (much less a sufficient number of planes, and jets had yet to be invented). It also was an America that didn't have many (and in MOST cases, ANY) of the workplace protections (such as OSHA) and social programs (such as Social Security and Medicare) that we take for granted today. However, even in that context, many of its themes (such as class struggles, upward mobility, and the effects of poverty on those forced to live under it) still have relevance in today's America (and the rest of the world).

  Yeah, the dialog is DEFINITELY dated in places (and probably wasn't accurate even when the movie was new [e.g.the exaggerated ""New York"" accents of the juvenile delinquents])  however, though some of the performances boarder on what we would now call performance art, MOST of the work by the principal actors/actresses is first rate. And, of course, there is Humphrey Bogart  who, in one of his early supporting ""gangster"" roles (along with, one my favorite character actors, Allen Jenkins  also as a gangster), easily steals the picture. Also notable for this movie is the fact that it features the first appearance of the ""Dead End Kids"" (a.k.a""The East Side Kids"", a.k.a""The Bowery Boys"")  who were featured regularly as supporting characters in other movies (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angels-With-Dirty-Faces-1938/dp/B0006HBV28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angels With Dirty Faces (1938)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Made-Me-a-Criminal-1939/dp/B00006G8F8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Made Me a Criminal (1939)</a>), and, a little later, as the stars of their own movies (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Junior-G-Men-of-the-Air-1940/dp/B0011Z5NFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Junior G-Men of the Air (1940)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bowery-Blitzkrieg-1941/dp/B00005QJJH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bowery Blitzkrieg (1941)</a>, The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters (1954), etc.). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  VIDEO: 4.7 (1.33:1  B&W [5.7 Kbps])

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this transfer exhibits good to frequently very-good picture quality. While there are artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines and an occasional dropped frame, they are very few and NEVER glaring. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are very-good throughout most of the film  with the textures of most clothing and furnishings being readily apparent and natural looking. Also, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are VERY good overall, and, in a large number of scenes, even excellent. This is the best that this movie is going to look until it gets a well-deserved high-definition re-mastering and subsequent blu-ray release.

  On a related side note: this movie features the beautiful cinematography of Gregg Toland (who, as many of you already know, was the cinematographer responsible for much of the ""look"" of Citizen Kane). Because of Mr. Toland's work, this is one of best looking black-and-white movies that you will ever see. It is a ""master class"" in lighting, composition and camera movement. Though, strictly speaking, it does not fall within the ""official"" definition of film noir (i.e.a film genre that encompasses certain themes that are darkly cynical and often seedy in tone, that are usually presented in highly stylized B&W crime dramas and urban slice-of-life movies made between the early 1940s and the late 1950s), I think it is one of best examples of film noir presently available  both visually and thematically. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  AUDIO: 2.4 (Dolby Digital 2.0 [Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  Unfortunately, this movie's audio presentation comes nowhere near to matching its fine visual presentation. The Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono) soundtrack, while featuring dialog that is usually clear (though frequently ""boxy"" sounding), has VERY limited dynamic range. Also, there isn't any bottom-end nor top-end to speak of (in fact, it sounds like the audio filter that was used to remove the hiss not only removed ALL of the high-frequencies, but MOST of the upper-midrange frequencies as well)  all of these limitations combine to make for an audio experience that is quite constrained and not very realistic sounding. Even though the movie is monophonic and dialog-driven, its audio presentation has slightly less than acceptable sound quality.

  EXTRAS: Trailer

  ----------------------

  The Westerner (1940)  NR  1:39:40 [Disc 3]
  Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, Doris Davenport, Forrest Tucker
  William Wyler (Director)

  MOVIE: 4.0

  A serviceable, if somewhat slow, fictionalized account of some of the exploits of the real-life ""judge"" Roy Bean and his obsession with all things related to Lillie Langtry.

  VIDEO: 4.4 (1.33:1  B&W [6.2 Kbps])

  This movie has very good picture quality  with NO artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines or dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are good  with the textures and patterns of most clothing and furnishings being easily discernible. Lastly, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are mostly good throughout. Overall, the picture quality of this movie is very-good (and, on occasion, even excellent [for a DVD])  and, it should satisfy all but the pickiest viewers.

  NOTE: This movie also features the beautiful cinematography of Gregg Toland (though, not employed to such a dramatic effect as in ""Dead End""  probably because, as its name implies, it is a western).

  AUDIO: 2.5 (Dolby Digital 2.0 [Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  This movie has a monophonic soundtrack that is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 format. It features dialog that is usually clear, with all voices being easily understood. However, dynamic range is limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end of which to speak (which makes the musical score and the Foley work sound a little 'thin' and less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements for this film  and the fact that it is monophonic and dialog-driven  its audio presentation has acceptable sound quality.

  EXTRAS: None

  ----------------------

  They Got Me Covered (1943)  NR  1:33:31 [Disc 4]
  Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Otto Preminger, Lenore Aubert
  David Butler (Director)

  MOVIE: 4.0

  Bob Hope as a wise-cracking newspaper man, aided by love-interest Dorothy Lamour, in pursuit of an expos of a Nazi spy ring.

  VIDEO: 4.0 (1.33:1  B&W [6.4 Kbps])

  Decent picture quality, with surprisingly (at least, to me) good contrast and gray-scale.

  AUDIO: 2.7 (Dolby Digital 2.0 [Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  Slightly better sounding than most of the other movies in this set  but, still a low dynamic range, monophonic and dialog-driven soundtrack.

  EXTRAS: None

  ----------------------

  The Princess and the Pirate (1944)  NR  1:33:55 [Disc 5]
  Bob Hope, Virginia Mayo, Walter Brennan, Victor McLaglen
  David Butler (Director)

  MOVIE: 3.0

  Bob Hope as a wise-cracking vaudevillian performer, who (more or less) fights off a gang of pirates and a corrupt government official, who are both in pursuit of Hope's love-interest (and damsel-in-distress) princess Virginia Mayo for their own nefarious reasons. Lighthearted fluff, with a few good comedic moments.

  VIDEO: 3.9 (1.33:1  Color [6.2 Kbps])

  Not quite as good looking as ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (mainly because it's a little softer in focus and its colors aren't quite as rich and vivid)  but, overall, still a good looking transfer.

  AUDIO: 2.8 (Dolby Digital 2.0 [Dual-Mono, 48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  This movie is the best sounding of the bunch (which really isn't saying very much  because, it's still a low dynamic range, monophonic and dialog-driven soundtrack).

  EXTRAS: Trailer

  ----------------------

  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947)  NR  1:50:29 [Disc 6]
  Danny Kaye, Virginia Mayo, Boris Karloff, Fay Bainter
  Norman Z. McLeod (Director)

  MOVIE: 2.5

  This time it's Danny Kaye, who (more or less) fights off spies for the hand of love-interest (and damsel-in-distress) Virginia Mayo. Not quite my taste in movies  but, boy, does its Technicolor presentation look ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS (even on DVD)!

  VIDEO: 4.0 (1.33:1  Color [5.7 Kbps])

  Colors are vivid and richly saturated (in that old Technicolor way), with very few obvious fluctuations. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are fairly good throughout most of the film  with the textures of hair-styles, most clothing and furnishings being readily apparent and natural looking. Also, contrast (again, for a DVD) is very good overall, and in very many scenes, even excellent. While I'm not crazy about the content of the movie, it does look fantastic!

  AUDIO: 2.6 (Dolby Digital 1.0 [48 KHz, 192 Kbps])

  Ever so slightly better sounding than most of the other movies in this set  but, still a low dynamic range, monophonic and dialog-driven soundtrack.
