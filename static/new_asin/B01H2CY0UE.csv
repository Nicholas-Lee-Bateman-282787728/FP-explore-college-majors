8764443,5,B01H2CY0UE,"Last month, I had the distinct pleasure of attending the premier of the documentary film, ""Tanks a Century of Dominating the Battlefield"" which was produced by USMC Vietnam veteran Clyde Hoch.  Clyde is a longtime member of the USMC Vietnam Tankers Association as well as a steadfast volunteer helping veterans' organization with a myriad of programs and solutions.  After viewing the documentary, I truly feel that it was very educational and deeply informative.  It is a must for anyone interested in subject of tanks and armor warfare.
