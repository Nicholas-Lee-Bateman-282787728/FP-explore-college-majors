8214713,5,B000MKXEPG,"I have wanted to see this movie for a long time and finally tracked down a DVD on Amazon.com.  I love watching  Indy films and this one was a double award winner at Sarasota Film Festival in 2006 and did not disappoint.

The films premise was capturing the first heady rush of falling in love and the story takes place over a period of one day.  The camera work and editing gave an overall dreamy, not quite real feel. The music is beautiful. The dialogue improvised.

Two characters meet by chance and have an immediate attraction.  They are both lonely and dissatisfied with their lives which drives them to act on impulse in ways that might otherwise be unthinkable.  The film manages to convey the exhilarating feeling of falling in love.  The characters know that their life commitments will prevent them from running off into the sunset , but the feeling that fate brought them together causes them to seize the moment.  The change in mood after they meet by chance in the coffee shop at night after he gives up the search for her is very noticeable. They no longer care what happens.

I really enjoyed this film because it is so different from mainstream Hollywood and gives a good view into everyday American lives together with an unusual exploration of the subject of falling in love.  If you are a fan of Indy films this is one to watch. If you enjoy romantic films this is one to watch, but be prepared for something very different and a little raw around the edges.",1368576000,,1478,4.539622641509434

It really captures the moment and feeling you get when you first fall in love.",1358899200,,242,4.170212765957447
