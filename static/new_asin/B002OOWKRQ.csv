3962693,2,B002OOWKRQ,"Who Shot Robin Hood?

  When I tuned onto the series finale of Robin Hood, I knew not to expect much. I'd read a few spoilers and I didn't like the writing of the first 12 episodes of season 3.
  The reason I kept watching, and that this is a 2 star instead of 1, is because the acting is brilliant. To see it is a real treat. If these actors are ever in a show that matches their talent in writing and production, it will be the best show on TV. They made even totally ridicules plots interesting because of their great chemistry together. For example the expressions on Armitage and Armstrong's faces as their characters, arch enemies, have to work together is priceless.
  Of course, it's only touching when arrogant Guy of Gisborne falls for a stubborn peasant girl if we forget what he did to his last love interest (of you don't know, it involves a very sharp and deadly sword). His character was so interesting - I loved what they were doing with him till the end of season two. But if they were going to make him a bad guy (no pun intended) they should have left it that way. It's hard to redeem yourself after killing Marian. Suddenly, Guy is willing to risk his life for Robin, but earlier in season three he's trying to drown his own sister.
  His sister - what's the point of Isabella's character? To say, abused women are insane murderesses? To say, if a woman's rejected, she throws away all her principles and becomes evil? Oh and what about the fact that Robin instantly recovers from losing Marion and is kissing her murderer's married sister?
  The other characters aren't developed at all. Remember Little John and Alice? Nothing there, no mention of her. Much? Does he finally prove himself to everybody, do they finally realize how brave he is? No. He takes off that ugly hat he always wears, but that's all. Allan, well, he's a good guy again, no mention of his working for Guy. Allan does not get rewarded for rejoining the outlaws - he has a pretty awful death.
  The new characters; Tuck is drastically different from the traditional character, but could have been cool. As it is, he just doesn't act enough like a role model and priest. He often is just a background character, and almost takes delight in killing people. Self-defense is one thing - but his character is more violent than need be. Kate is a cool character, but she doesn't make sense. At first she's conflicted about what the outlaws do, and while she tries her hardest, her good intentions don't end well (she tries to save her brother's freedom and he gets killed) suddenly she's an outlaw and is great at saving the day. Archer is only around for a few episodes. He goes from being a slimy little money-maker to being the hero.
  It was like the writers couldn't decide what to do. Robin having two new love interests so soon after Marion's death was ridicules. Having Guy become who fans wanted him to be after we all wanted to kill him - bad move. And since the writers couldn't have another season, they didn't wrap it up, they made fans miserable two. The villans we hate are killed quickly.  Heroes we love are killed painfully and slowly. Lots of relationships that could have had so much done with them are ended. Oh, and in the last episode, we learn that King Richard is kidnapped! Nothing is done about that, obviously. The series and plot die. But they couldn't really go on without Marion and Robin. What could have series 4 been called - Archer Hood?
  That this was supposed to be a family show is stupid. How can a family show involve a guy who killed his girlfriend cause she was in love with someone else? It also shouldn't involve people get shot full of arrows, people getting thrown off cliffs, a sister and brother trying to murder each other, a woman acting suggestively around her half-brother, someone giving a prisoner poison as a sign of `mercy', a man killing his fianc&eacute;e by `accident' (I don't mean Guy, he obviously meant to kill Marion) people turning on their friend because of something their enemy said, a man being stabbed by his sister and another man, a young woman being given to a man to `tame' (she is rescued later), or a couple making out on a bed, before/after having sex. Besides, it's not a good lesson to become best friends with someone after they've killed your wife.
  It's really depressing, cause this could have been such a great show!  The acting is worth watching a few episodes, but not buying.",1259971200,6,4451,4.531835205992509
3962694,2,B002OOWKRQ,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

There are many things you can do in a ""Robin Hood"" retelling. The BBC's version of the legend has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that killing off Maid Marian is definitely not one of them - though I'm sure many of us could have told them that *before* they actually went through with it. Prior to the airing of the third season of ""Robin Hood"", Laura Burrows of IGN interviewed Jonas Armstrong (Robin) on the upcoming series, with emphasis on the departure of Lucy Griffiths. She ended her article with this prediction:

""In total, the actor made light of Griffiths' quick exodus and did his best to throw us a few bones for the third season, but it seems that the writers may be scrambling to fill in the gaps made by a missing love interest and that the cast will be flying by the seat of their pants, acting scene-by-scene, until they came come to grips with an unsteady storyline."" (August 4, 2008)

Burrows' prediction was spot-on. Although there are plenty of note-worthy things about Season Three, the show has lost most of its charm - not just because of Marian's death, but due to the complete restructuring of the show itself by new management. The man responsible for the decision to kill Marian (series creator Dominic Mingella) played no part in this season, credited as ""creator"" in the opening credits, but contributing nothing to the directing, writing or storylines at all. This is distinctly odd considering the self-congratulatory tones he took in various interviews and on the Season Two DVDs, in which he calls Marian's death an opportunity to ""rock the show to its core,"" to ""see a darker side to Robin,"" and to ""open up new storytelling possibilities."" If he was that enthusiastic about killing off Marian, why didn't he stick around in order to see his story through to its end?

Whatever the reason for his departure, there was a palatable sense of disorganisation in the Tiger Aspect/BBC studios in regards to ""Robin Hood."" Little effort was put into promoting the third season, the official website wasn't updated until a few days before the premiere, detailed plot synopsises were released prior to episodes airing, and the premature release of the DVD box set in the UK ensured that the final episode was leaked onto YouTube long before it was scheduled to appear on television. Interviews with the cast members were oddly evasive on the subject of Marian's death, but though a ""close-mouthed policy"" seemed to be in place, Richard Armitage made his voice heard, stating in no uncertain terms that he had grave concerns about the decision to kill Marian: ""I think [the writers] are playing with fire.""

All this behind-the-scenes trouble inevitably leeched the quality of Season Three considering that the show was passed on to a new batch of writers (only two of the thirteen episodes were penned by writers who had worked on the show before) who were clearly unfamiliar with the preceding storylines, and had little idea of what to do with the fallout of Marian's death.

For simplicity's sake, the following review is divided into the good, the bad, and the ugly.

The Good

As always, the brilliant cast of actors throw themselves into their roles with one hundred and ten percent, transcending the material they've been given and churning out urgent and believable performances despite the ridiculousness of the plots they're stuck in. The original cast members have incredible chemistry together, and by this stage have been working together for over three years. Such a history means that they are imminently watchable, even when they're being painfully under-utilized. This ensemble cast of talented actors, the characters they inhabit, and the performances they deliver are the number one reason to watch this show.

In terms of storylines, there are plenty of intriguing twists and turns among the ""Team Castle"" cast. A guilt-stricken Guy has swiftly become a loose cannon, and the Sheriff decides to cut his losses and rid himself of his once-loyal henchman. When Prince John (brilliantly portrayed by Toby Stephens) finally enters the scene, he soon has the two of them at each other's throats by promising Guy the position of Sheriff if he rids them of the current one.

Also in the mix is Guy's sister Isabella (whose existence contradicts two seasons worth of Guy insisting that he had no family at all, but never mind), an enigmatic presence whose loyalties are questionable and who arguably has the most important role this season as she instigates the power-struggles that drive the overarching plot. Richard Armitage and Lara Pulver capture the sibling dynamic perfectly, and their physical similarities mean they could easily pass for brother/sister in real life. For the most part, the ""Dark Side"" plot works very well.

There also seems to have been a bigger budget this time around, resulting in higher production values. The costumes are significantly improved, as is the general scope and atmosphere of the show. And someone has finally realised just how beautiful their surroundings are, for now there are plenty of establishing shots that exploit the gorgeous forest scenery. Speaking of eye-candy, this is the most beautiful cast since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B000P12LWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>&nbsp;and perhaps the best way to watch the show is to simply ignore the plots and enjoy the view (though despite the presence of Lara Pulver, male viewers may find themselves a bit short-changed with the loss of both Lucy Griffith and Anjali Jay).

Finally, this show has always provided plenty of laughs. Like how the entire population of England doesn't seem to notice that Tuck is black, or how Prince John's secret weapon ends up being a lion that's so decrepit that it can't even walk in a straight line, or how Kate is slightly out of sync when chanting along with an angry mob. Robin invents the first hang-glider and then defies the laws of physics with it; and Kate performs CPR on somebody whose injuries don't actually require it. And as always, a raised hood is an impenetrable disguise; and hiding behind a twig or a sapling will render a grown man invisible. Good times.

The Bad

As fond as I am (or, was) of this show, there's no denying that the writing is nothing short of abysmal. Although any one episode may serve as mindless entertainment, close inspection - or even ""mild"" inspection - reveals some of the sloppiest scripts ever committed to the screen. Many storylines are raised only to go nowhere, dialogue is often nonsensical, continuity is non-existent, logic is thrown out the window, characterization is butchered, and (as a result of all this) talent is squandered.

Anachronisms, silliness, and a dose of cheesiness were all part of the fun of ""Robin Hood"" right from the beginning, but in season three, the writers/producers lost sight of why people tuned in. I (and I'm sure many others) watched for the magnificent cast and the range of intriguing, poignant, complex relationships that they managed to forge between their characters: namely the warm camaraderie of the outlaws and the delicate balancing act between Robin, Marian and Guy. In season three, all this has been flushed away. Even the important relationships that *do* remain intact are given little to no attention (Robin and Much are practically strangers now, and there is no indication whatsoever that Allan worked with Guy for most of last season. Marian is hardly ever mentioned. Oh, and remember Will and Djaq? Nobody else does). In lieu of meaningful emotional connection, the show no longer has any real heart.

Rather, many plots rely on characters acting irrationally and against their own established personalities. Robin and Isabella's relationship ends just as incoherently as it begins. Kate flip-flops between anti-Robin sentiments to simpering fan-girl for no apparent reason. Guy leaves Isabella to drown in a dungeon and then can't seem to understand why she hates him so much. Much and Allan spend several episodes infatuated with Kate, yet have little to no reaction when Robin hooks up with her instead. For a monk, Tuck condones some rather morally dubious things. Allan saves Little John's life, only for John to immediately turn on him when a highly-untrustworthy person suggests that Allan is a traitor. Robin states that he implicitly trusts the man who killed his wife, and yet isn't prepared to give one of his own men the benefit of the doubt. Archer leaves his half-brothers to die after they've saved him from the noose, but then decides to join the team after Kate throws a tantrum. Even the extras behave inexplicably: a mob enthusiastically chants for Robin to be burnt at the stake, only to jump around cheering when he escapes two minutes later.

Um...is everyone a bi-polar schizophrenic with short-term memory loss? The swiftness with which characters declare their intentions, make foolish decisions, change their minds, assign blame, leap to conclusions, change their minds again, act rashly, and forget what happened three minutes ago is just mind-boggling, and I can only imagine that the erratic shifts in behaviour will be even more pronounced when episodes are seen in succession on DVD.

This choppy storytelling has never been more apparent than in what is known as ""the flashback episode"". With absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever, the writers suddenly introduce a complex back-story between Robin and Guy that accumulates in the revelation that they share a half-brother. Neither man has ever mentioned their dramatic joint-history before, and the new information is relayed to Robin and Guy via Robin's long-lost father, who convinces them to save their long-lost brother, so that they can defeat Guy's long-lost sister. I can't believe I'm not making this up.

(And I've just realised why Robin gets over Marian's death so appallingly fast: if the writers had portrayed him grieving realistically, then his alliance with Guy would have been even more implausible than it already was).

Yeah, I know that the past two seasons were rife with their fair share of silliness, but by this stage, the show suffers from ""mood whiplash"". The writers are working in a context in which Marian's murder is hanging over everyone's heads, yet the producers' apparent desire to cater to a wide target audience results in the most erratic combination of content and tones I've ever seen on a television programme. It swings wildly between gritty drama, slapstick comedy, kiddie-friendly action/adventure, and melodramatic soap opera. Alongside vengeance, torture, adultery, murder, abuse, seduction, attempted rape and even mild incestuous overtones, are goofy child-friendly antics like hang-gliding, lion-taming, gladiator-fighting, and ninja-star throwing. At one stage they even stoop to gross-out jokes, wherein Tuck climbs up a sewage system and into a recently occupied privy.

Essentially, the show doesn't seem to know who it's for. Some parts are too dark and violent for children, and others are too preposterous for adults looking for a reasonable continuation of the serious tone the show set for itself with Marian's murder.

The Ugly

The departure of Will and Djaq left two vacancies in the outlaw gang. These were filled by the much anticipated Tuck and the dreaded ""feisty village girl"" Kate. Tuck initially acquits himself well, what with his enigmatic past and unclear motivations, but is soon rendered just another face in the crowd. Although this character was in a perfect position to act as a mediator between Robin and Guy, preaching the themes of forgiveness and atonement, he just ends up being Robin's PR spokesman with a tendency for impromptu speeches. What a waste.

As for Kate...well, you know you've got problems when a character's defining attribute is abject stupidity, and her only purpose on the show is to be the Mandatory Female. Whiny, pushy, sulky, petty, hypocritical, shrill, needy, dim-witted, arrogant... there's nothing even remotely appealing about this character, and her inability to do anything helpful, say anything pleasant, or be anything other than a complete liability gets very old, very fast. After her idiotic behavior gets her brother killed and her family's business destroyed, the outlaws inexplicably invite her to join the team, and we're subjected to faux-Marian stomping around Sherwood, blundering into trouble, emasculating the outlaws, and single-mindedly pursuing the only goal the writers bother to give her: become Robin's girlfriend. Even more nauseating, the outlaws seem to be under the impression that she's (in their own words) ""amazing"" and ""brave and compassionate"" and ""a treasure,"" despite Kate never doing a single solitary thing to deserve these platitudes. Can you say blatant Mary Sue?

Oblivious as to how obnoxious she is, the writers give her way too much screen-time and eventually relegate her to the role of Robin's rebound girl, following a general theme of women going completely gaga over Robin. See Marian: dead because she couldn't contain her love for Robin in front of a crazy man with a sword, or Isabella: perfectly sane until the moment Robin dumps her, at which point she instantly reverts into a complete lunatic.

I know that not every female character in a show aimed at young people can be a positive role model, but it would have been nice if at least ONE was.

(Seriously though, the victimization of women on this show gets immensely disturbing after a while. Not only do we have Marian's stabbing at the hands of a man who claimed to have loved her (a scene that Dominic Mingella called ""the consummation of Guy and Marian""), but also the fact that Isabella goes evil as a *direct* result of domestic abuse and her dysfunctional relationships with Robin and Guy. She is ultimately cast as the irredeemable villain, despite both men inflicting unprovoked violence on her several times. Kate's instantaneous hatred of Isabella is the result of her inevitable jealousy over Robin, and when left to her own devices, Kate is merely a damsel-in-distress who gets threatened/arrested/kidnapped practically every episode, requiring a male character to rescue her from her own staggering incompentence each and every time. Even the prominent guest-stars Ghislaine and Meg are both sacrificed on behalf of men they are trying to protect.)

Ultimately, the biggest disappointment of Season Three stems from the fact that the new writers don't seem to have much affection for, interest in, or even basic understanding of the characters they've inherited, and many of their storytelling decisions are just...well, ""mean-spirited"" is the only word I can think of to describe it.

Why were Will and Djaq written out of the show in such an unsatisfying way, never to be seen or heard from again? Why would Robin enter a relationship with the (married) sister of the man who murdered his wife? Couldn't the outlaws have been given something - anything! - else to do besides run around after Kate like a bunch of harangued babysitters with a disobedient child? Was it entertaining to see Isabella suffer a mental breakdown after a lifetime of domestic abuse? Was it meant to be fun watching poor Much get his heart broken by his best friend and a shrieking harpy? (After his passionate rant to Robin last season about how he's not appreciated, it was a bitter pill indeed to watch him reclaim his dignity from Robin only to sacrifice it all up to Kate).

If Allan had to die, would it have been so hard to let him go down in a blaze of glory instead of a heartless, meaningless Red Shirt death? After ignoring him all season, the writers have him shot in the back on the side of the road, failing in the attempt to deliver an important message, and dying in the belief that his friends consider him a traitor. What a pathetic and hateful way to get rid of one of the show's most popular characters.

Little John...was he even in this season? Was it really necessary to introduce the ridiculous plot device of the half-brother, a gimmick that required the restructuring of canon itself? Why was so much time wasted on hooking Robin up with Kate in a relationship that was never going anywhere, was void of any chemistry, and which played out like a bored rock star finally caving to a desperate groupie? Why Kate, period? The show gains nothing from her presence, and her aggressive, childish pursuit of Robin is just cringe-worthy. And Guy...well, I'm still speechless over what they did to him.

None of these storylines are particularly entertaining, instead each one lies somewhere between ""annoying and pointless"" and ""way too dark and depressing for a family show"".

Maybe I expected too much; but given that the writers were handed the legend of Robin Hood as well as one of the most talented ensemble casts in living memory, this show had the potential to be the best retelling of the story ever, something that was sabotaged by an onslaught of terrible creative decisions, starting from the moment Guy plunged that giant sword into Marian's abdomen. This was the first and biggest nail in the show's coffin, and to this day I cannot understand how Dominic Mingella could have deemed Marian's murder an appropriate and entertaining ""twist"" in what had previously been such a fun, light-hearted show. When did Marian getting murdered by Guy EVER seem like a good idea? What on *earth* was this meant to achieve? I'm sure that for many, this show died with her.

At times, this season does manage to capture some of its past magic (Guy versus the Sheriff; Prince John; Guy/Meg; Robin's reunion with Marian), but the new stories are a significant step down from previous seasons, especially since the new characters are emphasised at the cost of our old favourites (check out the cover art on the DVD: the fact that Kate's image is significantly larger than Guy's is the perfect visual image of everything that's wrong with season three). The BBC blamed poor ratings for the cancellation of the show, but unfortunately the writers had already put a lot of effort into setting up for a forth season, meaning that Season Three feels more like setup for the future than closure on the past.

But it came as no surprise to me when ""Robin Hood"" was cancelled - by this stage the Powers That Be had systematically removed everything from the show that made it worth watching in the first place.",1259452800,177,18492,5.037945698397121
3962695,5,B002OOWKRQ,A great old tale told in a modern way with a HOT HOT HOT cast! Very worth while especially if you need your Richard Armitage fix!,1259280000,5,129,4.0
3962696,4,B002OOWKRQ,"The reason I love this series is because it is so much fun. I am a huge fan of the Robin Hood legend. My favorite rendition is Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Robin Hood"", 1938) but what Jonas Armstrong brings to the character shouldn't be missed. Armstrong's facial expressions and delivery makes you love Robin even more.

The actors who portray Hood's gang was well cast. They play off each other beautifully. I feel the group is more unified that I have ever seen before-I love it when they state together, ""WE ARE ROBIN HOOD"". you realize that is is more than one person, it is an ideal.

The storytelling is also well done. It gives you more than Robin Hood and his band of thieves stealing from the rich (and giving to the poor). From the beginning of season 1, you discover the history of Robin Hood, the Sheriff of Nottingham (brilliantly played by Keith Allen), the battle of the throne between Richard and John as well as how the gang was formed.

The 3rd and last on BBC America is another gem even though I miss Allen as the Sheriff (was in the first few episodes only).  There has been a different approach (with new characters) and unique story lines this season-like discovering that Robin's father is still alive and he has a half-brother.  Of the three seasons, I would say the 2nd is my favorite.

So many people are critical of certain details (i.e. accuracy of costumes). Personally, I think it is a beautiful telling of the legend in every way. It is an enjoyable series-lighthearted and fun.

I hate to say goodbye to Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood after only three seasons. Thank goodness for DVDs so I can continue to invite him, Big John, Much, Tuck and the others in my home.",1258502400,21,1696,4.540983606557377

They managed to stretch out a pretty simple legend and/or bit of history into a great epic of the human desire to be free but not without abandoning the need for noble authority to be in place.  The loyalties and treacheries all played out as they should have pretty much (bad guys lost - good guys won) .  That's good entertainment to me and very suitable for family viewing.  Could they make a season 4 with Robin's half brother coming to fill the void of title role character?.  They pretty much finished off the starting cast; but with Archer's archery skill obviously seeming to be equal to Robin of Locksley  I think a good story line could continue it on.

And it is quite amazing how a wooden bow can so easily deflect a broad sword.

Then theres the main gate which provides for a draw bar on the outside of the gate (where Little John placed his staff to bar the soldiers from coming out). Draw bars were used to keep the enemy out (on the inside of the gates) rather than keep the occupants in. More silliness from the writers who hope we don't notice.

After Marian's *SPOILER* (*cough* death *cough*)
Robin goes off his rocker and seeks revenge on Guy.
Shortly later,The gang expands.
Allan is back and still seen as a traitor to the very end.
Then new members arrive Friar Tuck and Kate(gag me).
I never did see why people hated her so much but now I get it.
Marian was a heroine. Kate is good at nothing more than getting herself in trouble.
On the flip side. Enter Prince John. Evil, cowardly, and self-absorbed.
As well as the misguided Isabella of Guisborne. Yep, Guisy(as the sheriff called him) has a sister. She can't decide who to fight for. One moment she's helping our outlaw friends and the next she's graveling at prince John's feet searching for a way to gain power. There's also killing her brother to handle. The two of them constantly trying to off each other.
I'm really disappointed in the writers. Marian's corpse is still warm and here they are trying to force two new lovers onto Robin...Isabella and Kate if you hadn't guessed.
The prelude and the finale itself intrigued me.
But I found the ending to be bittersweet.

3962856,2,B002OOWKRQ,"I enjoyed season 1 and 2 of Robin Hood very much, loving the wonderful color of cast and characters, the humor, adventure, and action. When I saw that you could watch season 3 with the amazon prime trial I took that chance and watched it.  I wanted to buy the physical copy later on, but hearing some bad things about that last season, wanted to try it for myself first. I didn't have too big a wish to watch this season because of Lucy Griffith leaving, but I wanted to see how Sir. Guy did and how his character improved during the show.
Watching the first episode, I was instantly thrust into a ""new"" world/version of Robin Hood (that's right - new). The costumes had changed (though I always love the consumes!). Robin changed (for the worse). Guy changed.
Robin was a very angry man, Guy depressed and both men wanting revenge (apparently it was the only thing that kept them going, as they said so themselves). Somehow season three seemed like a whole new world then 1 and 2, but I was still eager to carry on. I was going to give 3 a chance and actually didn't mind the first two episodes, because I got to see how Marian's death effected Robin and Guy. It didn't bode well with me though because despite the new edition of Tuck in the gang, the show continued to get worse. If you like the ""new"" Robin Hood that is fine, but for me it was depressing and heartbreaking because I missed the fun-living, cheeky, Robin.
Not only did Robin's personality change, but the other members of his gang (Little John, Much, Allan....) didn't develop any further then season 2. By developing, I mean character wise - their stories didn't go any further.  I felt that season 3 didn't give them enough screen time, because frankly I wondered where Much's humor and the funny things he did had gone. Where was Little John who always gave direction and advice (Tuck took that place when he joined the gang), and why in the world did the girl they added to replace Marian, (Kate), have to be thrown into it all as well?
I don't want to be harsh but I want to be truthful - Kate annoyed me. I don't want to be thinking this because simply the writers (or whoever decided these kinds of things for the show), threw her in to replace Marian (or so it seemed), but Kate seemed immature, and pushy - I didn't like her attitude most of the time. She wanted Robin to love her, and he kissed her (twice or so), making me wonder how one minute he was depressed because of Marian, and the other in love with Kate. Though Little John did tell him to not let Kate go, so that also made me mad.
Oh, and what happened to Will and Jack? I'm sorry again if I am sounding too harsh, but I felt as if the people who did the show wanted to make it a new show. It seemed as if they threw all the other characters they took out in season 2  aside entirely - Will and Jack were never mentioned again (or not that I can recall). I missed them terribly. Marian was mentioned, but as I said before, was Robin so shallow that he would fall for other women so quickly?

One thing didn't disappointment me though, and that was the fact that Guy did get better later on and his character did progress and develop. His character went further and better then the rest, I think because they went more in depth it seemed with him. He became not so depressed - I actually liked the new Guy! He had a sweet romance type relationship with a girl very briefly, but then they killed her off (did the creators of Robin Hood want anyone to live?!). Overall I want to buy a physical copy because of him!
 Guy's sister wasn't too bad because it made the show a good type of different. It was kinda nice having more then just one main girl in the show, and she was even more cunning then the old Sheriff at times. She was also depressed and a very angry woman, but who can blame her? Her brother sold her, and her husband was obviously abusive. I loved one line where she told Robin (when he said he hated Guy as well as she), that she wasn't proud to hate Guy - it made me feel sorry for her for some reason...

I give the season 3 of Robin Hood two stars because Prince John was hilarious! I don't know if the Prince John in real life acted like that but I loved him! He got a little stupid at times, but he made the show even better! I also gave the show two stars because of Sir Guy's development as the show progressed, and the back story of Robin and Guy. Speaking of ""back story"" , I really enjoyed Guy and Robin's story of their life as they were kids and teens. It made everything come together for me and then it made a little more sense. Though I do have to wonder why they never put that in season 2 - it would have been a lot better that way!
I also was giving it close to a three stars because it had lots of adventure and action - edge of your seat I don't know what will happen next kind, but I'll stick with two.  And despite as I said before a lot of the humor was gone, Robin still had his cheeky moments (though they were rare), and that grin I really like. Much still had some humor, though totally not as much (no pun intended), and there was some moments I thought profound and inspiring.

One reason why season 3 disgusted me though, was because one thing they in there I wouldn't recommend young children seeing (or anyone really) -  Archer (a later edition to the show), sleeping with a married woman. It didn't show much except for Archer having his shirt off and him sleeping beside a woman, with kissing later on (when they were out of bed), but still I was upset. If you watch behind the scenes in season 2 (or was it 1?),  the people who did Robin Hood, wanted it family friendly, but season 3 was very dark at times with vengeance, cruelty, hatred and some things young children wouldn't understand.
The plot was choppy at times as well, and overall it was Ok, but not my kind of season. Season three had a hard time coming together, and though I may still buy the physical copy so I can re watch the first few episodes, I might not.... it was kinda depressing.",1401667200,,6039,4.234375
3962857,4,B002OOWKRQ,"The cliffhanger from season 2 was spectacular in that it was totally unexpected.  Now, in season 3 the story has a hard time staying on a consistent story arc.  Introductions of new characters complicate the story without sufficient time to allow for proper backstory or character development.  The season has some strong stories, but has a difficult time connecting them into a coherent tale.  The final two episodes were gratifying, granting closure on some open storylines, but still struggled to come from a cohesive backstory.  Overall, I enjoyed the three seasons.",1401494400,,570,5.21978021978022

There is no Robin Hood without Maid Marian and when they killed Marian in Season 2, they killed the series.  It's no wonder there wasn't a season 4.

Lucy Griffiths was perfect as Marion and she coupled to great acting of Jonas Armstrong, who in my mind there was no actor better suited to the role of Robin Hood, that duet was the epitomy of love for this series.  When Lucy Griffiths left the show, a new actor should have replaced her to continue the role of Marion and while I too would have complained about the producers letting Lucy get away, I believe the show could have continued on.  Season 3's Robin seemed to lose the dynamics of the previous two season's Robin, likely due to the disruption in relationships the new characters caused, the added story lines to ""explain"" who these newbies were, while splitting the long-term respect and friendships Robin had with his ""merry men"". The distractions of other women, almost without remorse for the loss of his true love, seemed callous.

3962877,3,B002OOWKRQ,It seemed like this was a last minute decision to make one more season. After major characters departures the writers didn't know what to do with rest cast so this season does not compare to previous seasons.

3962878,3,B002OOWKRQ,"Good action, romance seemed to be forced, plot was hooky at times, enjoyed character Much &  Little John, and Guy",1394236800,,113,4.65
3962879,5,B002OOWKRQ,"the first thing I loved about this show was the continual undertone of self-sacrifice in everything Robin did. and although he has plenty of flaws which are occasionally brought to the surface, that really only makes his character all the more fascinating.
the end of season 2, although very touching, left plenty of questions in my mind as to how on earth the show would pick back up after losing so many characters. this season suffered for the change, and the plot fizzled ever so slightly-it could have been better. however, the addition of a few new characters got it back on its feet and the last two discs make the rest worth watching.
  one of the new additions is the world's coolest Friar Tuck (or Brother Tuck as everyone in the show calls him). he makes a startling entrance, descending on the plot like a thunderclap and putting the Robin Hood world back in order in the space of a single episode. then there's Kate, presumably the Marian/Djaq replacement who nevertheless finds a voice of her own. Guy's sister appears on the scene, and eventually becomes the 'big bad' element of the show, replacing her brother, whose redemption story is a small but nonetheless poignant part of the plot.
  although this season is (apparently) meant to reveal a darker side of the Robin Hood legend, and does have less joking around than the average Hood story, what it really does is look deeper into Robin Hood himself, and what it comes up with is someone who was willing to give up his life for the people around him-and eventually does. after the tragedy of season 2, Robin struggles through season 3, trying not to fall apart, and at the end, he is finally granted peace. this conclusion, although heartbreakingly final, is artfully done and finishes off with a hopeful last scene that made me love the show even more than I already did.
  and with that in mind, i have a few criticisms. first of all, Isabella was a horrible character. her outfits and demeanor made her seem like a dominatrix and her character arc didn't make sense. the episodes in the middle of the season acted as filler, not plotline, and there was a completely unnecessary death at the end. a little more closure would have been appreciated.
  in the end, however, this remains one o the best Robin Hood adaptations I have ever had the pleasure to see. I enjoyed every minute of it and will definitely return to watch it again.",1394150400,,2406,4.644705882352941

While this sets up for a season 4, it just didn't work and season 4 never happened. I wish they had just used the remainder of the season to end the series, that would have been much better. Unfortunately, the end of this season is just a circus of character twists and motivation shifts that run over the previous two years of established plot. Boo.

Obviously I knew the show ended, and I knew the general gist of what happened in the end - but I had no idea how the writers would get it there.

I'm sure many of the fans that watched the show when it was airing were really mad at season 3 because it was so different, but I actually liked it a lot.  I didn't care much for some of the writing and yes, the plot(s) were far fetched, full of holes, and a complete jump from cannon - but the cast tackled these characters 150% and really sold the show.  Richard Armatage is the massive break-out star here, with this silly little show helping to catapult him to world wide fame and it's well deserved.  I loved his character.  He managed to sell a lot of emotion just with those amazing eyes.  I hope for the best for Jonas Armstrong, I badly want to see him in other major rolls, as I think his abilities have been WAY overlooked.  His final, ahem, speaking scene is just brilliant.  SPOILER:  His acting choice to crumple into the tree alone without any grace - just letting his body go no matter how not-pretty it looked - was just fantastic, especially after seeing character after character die all dramatic and pretty.

Friar Tuck is a nice addition to the cast but kate... Not so much... so is Isabella (Gisborne's sister).
Robin is still great, as is Much and John.
We see less of the sheriff and more of a tortured Gisborne (which can get anoying..)
It's great to see the story continue even if Marian is gone but it does take a bit of the magic away.... I just don't get why they didn't recast her instead of killing her...",1370390400,,450,4.183908045977011

Every episode leaves you mesmerized and draws you in as one feels part of the drama. The ending is quite emotional. I loved the fact that Guy of Gisborne changed and becomes allied with Robin Hood at the end after the revelation of their family linkage...and especially the fact that they both have a half brother, Archer. However, I thought that it would have a better and happily ever after ending as the three would take on the fight for justice. Not so...both Guy and Robin die which makes me wonder why all the series that are produced by the british end tragically...apparently they don't believe in good endings or happily ever after.

It's not just that we're missing several of our favorite characters - Guy is missing from his primary role, the Sherriff is on his way out, and Marion is of course, gone, having been killed by Guy in the last episode of the 2nd season.  It's just a missing feel for this season - the members of the gang are barely used, feeling more like props than main characters.  In particular, Much - having once been Robin's right hand man is barely being used as a character.  And why exactly did we need to mysteriously add on Friar Tuck?

I felt a bit unsettled and wary of what I might find.  Oh how happy I am that I stuck it out and watched.  Yes the writing style changed but the stories were great.  I could see how Gisborn could deny having a family.  Adding his sister into the fray and teaming her against Robin while he remained frustratingly loyal to her was good.  Although saddened by Marion's demise, I loved how they worked this out (shades of Gladiator!).  A romantic will love this ending!  Much like Marion, I could see the humane heart in Gisborn.  Hence, I was happy to find him on the side of the right and just.  Though the series has ended, Robinhood lives on in us all.  C'mon. Admit it! Even just a little bit?  I hope you'll enjoy this series as much as I have.  Good day and good knight!",1366416000,,928,4.350877192982456
3963043,2,B002OOWKRQ,"I'm only a couple episodes in and so far, I've not been impressed.  Without giving away too many spoilers, the absence of a few of S1 and S2's major characters left the writers scrambling to find actors to replace these shining stars.

3963059,2,B002OOWKRQ,"I was excited to start watching this. After all who doesn't like a good tale of Robin Hood!
Well to begin with, as most people noted, this season, season 3, becomes a bit stale when Marian is gone. Two other main roles are also gone (Djaq and Will) and it leaves this season very empty.
I read somewhere that this season was written by different people.
This must be so because it was very different from the last seasons.
To recap:
The first season was a bit repetitive at first, ...steal from the rich give to the poor....steal from the rich give to the poor.....
then it got interesting with betrayal and more deeper stories.
Season 2 was by far the best. The characters were amazing and the drama between Marian and Robin was heightened. And then they lost it all...
Marian dies and the second season seems strange. There is no more laughing at all. Much, the funny character makes no more jokes and the comical relief is gone. To make matters worse the story makes no sense at all.
Gisbourne joining forces with Robin Hood... Its a 'cute' twist at best but not a real one. He killed Marian and Kate's brother not to mention millions of others!
No one on planet earth just lets go of something like that. And then they just kept piling on the stupidity, Robin beginning to love so fast after losing Marian, or making a backstory between Gisbourne and Robin which is just weird. Gisbourne said he had no family.
Isabella acts out of character. One episode she's good and the next she's evil.
Why did Isabella claim Allan Adele a free man in the second to last episode?
We still never know. (the gang thought it was because he betrayed them and told her about their cave plans in exchange for freedom, but that was not the reason. Isabella only learnt about the caves AFTER she said to make him a free man. So what was her motive?)

then the townspeople help to take over nothhingham! where were they for the past 50 episodes? And the Sheriff comes back but isn't there a law that if the sheriff is killed, Prince John will come and destroy the place? Its confusing and the story breaks its own rules.

the story has holes beyond repair and a good series goes down the drain.
The characters act strange and out of character in this season.
I'm sad that it ended, it looked like it was going places. Season 3 was the death of this show.",1353196800,,2337,4.419953596287703
3963060,4,B002OOWKRQ,"Great character line up.  Keeps with the story but really shows the inner workings of how the story of Robin Hood might have unfolded.  A modern day Locksley with cinematic character depth, each having a story, a life, a tale, but all intertwined to unveil the truths behind a hero.",1351555200,,282,4.62

3963062,4,B002OOWKRQ,"I really liked it up to the last episode of the second season, then I was pissed off! Continued to watch it anyway and even though the third season had some good episodes, they ended the show horribly.  It could have ended a lot better.",1348531200,,236,4.2444444444444445

3963065,3,B002OOWKRQ,"Good show, well worth watching. Suspense, well developed characters. Some overacting by the bad guys but the good guys had a nice light hearted touch.

3963066,5,B002OOWKRQ,"If you didn't think that one more Robin Hood incarnation could possible hold its own against the long series of productions over the past decades, here's the proof that it indeed can--and HAS--been done. This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.

You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.

The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.

Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass, and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging.

Season Three is the most unusual of the three Robin Hood seasons, taking the original story and extending and working with it to create its own set of stories that are based on the orignal. Friar Tuck, finally introduced in this last Season, takes on a major role in the story, and Robin himself finds his epic battle with Guy of Gisborne elevated into a new area not before seen. I would highly recommend that the viewer start with Seasons a=One and Two before moving on to Season Three, as the traditional story is more closely told and established in those first two Seasons, and then you can watch the fun the writers have with the material as they enter Season Three.

This show is fun, entertaining, and often, thought-provoking. It pulls on your emotions. It draws you in. Kids can enjoy it as well as adults. Five stars.",1325635200,7,4037,4.593619972260749

They tried to bring in new cast but it did not work. Kate serves to remind us of how much less of a woman she is compared to Marion. She is a silly, one dimensional woman with no depth. How Robin can forget so easily and be swayed by the likes of her and Isabella is beyond me. Tuck seemed like he was going to be a good addition in his first appearance but after a few episodes, we come to realize that he is also a one track character. The only person who was entertaining was Toby as Prince John but even then, his performance was a fraction of what he can normally do.

The storylines were ridiculous. After two seasons, the characters that we have grown to love deserve to be treated with respect. The writers' treatment of Alan, the sheriff and even Robin is just pure laziness. This season just fizzled...badly.",1302048000,,1074,4.446700507614213

3963075,3,B002OOWKRQ,"This is not a review of the content of the series but of the DVD release itself, and presumes that potential buyers have already watched the show as it aired on television.

With reservation, I sincerely enjoyed the third season, and for the sake of a complete collection, felt compelled to purchase this DVD set, but I admit I was more on the fence about it than the prior two seasons, and that was not related to the series itself as much as the DVD release and its lack of particular special features.  This release would have been made infinitely better with cast commentary - which was one of the singular reasons to purchase the previous box sets - and more interviews with the cast, or the writers.  I would have been particularly interested in interviews with, or about, Lucy, since there were so many unanswered questions from season 2 in terms of behind the scenes choices, creative development, and story.  In short, the loss of Marian was a dreadful blow and as good as season 3 was in parts, I'm not sure that emotionally everyone (cast, crew, fans) recovered.  The subsequent changes to the 'look' of the show - costumes, set design, etc. - seemed merely like coverups to distract from her absence, or fill her void, but could not.  A cast commentary or more extensive interviews would have helped add some more closure and finality.

I'm still confused at the cover artwork and the marketing campaign that sought to place Tuck front and center when this series, this season, ended up being largely about Robin and the Gisborne family, and felt that could have been designed much better.

All in all this DVD set is desirable for those who want to rewatch episodes (obviously) or complete a collection (obviously) but not much more.  If you saw the show on TV, I'm not sure it's worth going the extra mile and getting these DVDs.",1287792000,,1843,4.6461538461538465

It had so many wonderful things, and even after the second season ended, I held out hope that the third season would work its magic to make the lack of Marian-Djaq-Will bearable. But no. The last few episodes literally had me crying--all the characters I had loved since the beginning met lackluster and pitiful ends. I felt so bad that this is how I would last remember them. The new characters weren't terrible per se; they just could not compare with shoes left behind. Isabella was God-awful, and I wishing for her death the moment I saw her on screen. Call me a traditionalist, but to see an evil, manipulative and selfish character replace the determined and righteous Marian was just too much. Tuck was promising but faded into just another prop piece with an occasional line or two. I can say though the last three minutes were my favorite part of the series, but I didn't like what I went through to get there.

3963077,2,B002OOWKRQ,"Most people who tune in to watch a TV show entitled Robin Hood probably fall into three groups. The first two are closely related: people who like Robin Hood and medieval junkies (like myself). The third group are people who just want a fun show to watch and who don't care about period accuracy or the legends at all. This show is aimed at the latter group, which doesn't much real sense.

Season 3 of this new incarnation looks much better than 1 and 2, but there are still daft choices which might be OK if the show was set in a fantasy land. A female sheriff of Nottingham (??), a black Friar Tuck (???!) and the odd ninja weapon (?????!!!!). All this makes it very hard to take seriously.

For me, this show will always be squarely in the shadow of the old 1980s Robin of Sherwood TV show, imperfect as it was. One thing both versions have in common are the arbitrary decisions to write out Maid Marion in unsatisfactory ways.",1278892800,,931,4.375722543352601

Season 2 was wonderful. . .  that is, up until they killed Marion off, which I thought was depressing. But I thought, they could always resurrect her twin sister or a look-a-like . . . So I waited another year for Season 3 . . . it was ok, I didn't personally care for the new Kate character at all, nor did I think the interaction between Robin & Guy in this season was as believeable.

Sorry this mini-series ended, but it ended WELL. This version of Robin Hood was well written & is lovingly remembered. I would recommend that ROBIN HOOD fans check Richard Carpenter's version out (that is, if you haven't already seen it).

Without that tension, this series descended into a cesspool of poo.  This season was just plain dumb.  Okay, RA is still gorgeous, but the plots - if you could call them that - sucked.

Certainly, Robin Hood could also, with a different plotline; perhaps not dying of the poison after all. Location a problem? Then move to site in England or Ireland. The ""scene/story has already been set"" with the principals, and now, new areas of interest can be explored; Richard's return, etc. Excellent scenery, actors...but the series ended too soon.",1272326400,,596,5.21875

As Season three begins Robin is out for revenge to kill Guy (who murdered Marian at the end of the second season) as he is left for dead, Friar Tuck comes and rescues him. Friar shows Robin that he has forgotten the every thing that has made him a legend and brings him back from his dark - self and into a realization that there is still hope. Throughout the series you have new characters who bring a great balance to the show. This was indeed a worthy end to the BBC Robin Hood franchise.

3963083,4,B002OOWKRQ,"After reading many negative reviews of the final season, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it very much. I only bought it because I just had to see it through to the conclusion. I think the new team of writers did a fantastic job of dealing with the hand they were dealt. Remember, these aren't the boneheads who killed off the beloved Marion. And for those viewers who really miss her loss, these writers will give you a nice gift in the finale that will ease your pain considerably! Finally we get to see a lot of the beautiful lush surroundings that lie within Sherwood Forest, Loxley, and Nottingham. The filming was exceptional. I even got to really enjoy all 3 of the new characters. Tuck steps in and brings a great stabilizing presence to the group. Guy's beautiful sister is certainly a welcome dose of eye candy for male viewers and her constantly flip flopping loyalties will keep you guessing. The only thing I didn't really care for was the weird connection with Guy that Robin had via a half brother and the resulting tenuous bond that developed between them. I badly kept wishing to see Robin run a blade, or a half dozen arrows, thru Guy and thus exact at least some revenge for his murdering Marion. In conclusion, if you really enjoyed the first two seasons, I strongly recommend
that you give the final season a chance.",1269993600,3,1332,4.577405857740586

3963085,3,B002OOWKRQ,"I wanted to love season three of the delightful ""Robin Hood"", I really did.  Season one and two were filled with a sense of fun, loads of anachronisms and delightful, silly plotlines that extracted Our Hero from the worst of scrapes.  Then the last episode of season two came along and the bell tolled for the series.  As has already been said, season three is a mixed up mess of disjointed storylines, confusing relationships and generally proceeds like a ship with no rudder.  I still loved the characters - Robin, Much, Allan and John.  I actually didn't mind the Tuck character so much but sorely missed Will Scarlet and Djaq.  Other than that, here were the greatest problems as I saw them:

Many have mentioned that the character Kate was annoying but I have to say that I found Isabella far more so.  Nothing about her made sense.  Isabella and Guy (brother and sister) spent the entire span of the season trying to kill each other.  Seriously, her character wore me out.  One minute fawning over Robin, helping the outlaws and the next bent on murdering them all.  It was exhausting.  I didn't get Robin's obsession with her either considering his grief over Marian's death.  It was a bit cringeworthy, to tell the truth.

Then there was Kate.  Though I grew to like her spunk, I didn't get the non-development of her relationship with Robin.  In one episode she's a member of the gang, the next, Robin is devoted to her in some weird sort of way I never understood.  The series would have been far better if the writers had paired her up with Much.  It would have been more in keeping with their medieval 'social standing' and would have left Robin free to pursue the job of re-taking Nottingham for King Richard.  It would have also given Much something to live for after losing Robin.  Robin's relationship with Isabella and Kate made very little sense in the context of the story arc.

This series had far too many cycles of trust, betrayal, deceit, trust, betrayal, deceit going on.  As mentioned before, it was exhausting and barely believable.

Archer.  Where do I start?  This character was all wrong from beginning to end.  The backstory between the families of Guy and Robin was out of left field.  I believe good writers could have Guy and Robin join up without bringing in this long lost brother thing. Again, one minute Archer was betraying his brothers, the next helping them - and this happened several times!  Would anyone ever believe he could be trusted?  But the really BIG, annoying thing to me was Archer's age.  For Pete's sake, he looked older than Robin and from what I could get from that convoluted story, Robin was about 12 or 13 when Archer was born - that would make Archer an (approximately) 18 year old kid who looked 30.  It's nitpicky, but it really bothered me.

However, having said all this, I'm glad I watched.  I needed to put a period at the end of the three seasons.  It's just too bad that, if it had been done right, the series could have ended with an exclamation point.",1265500800,4,3021,4.593632958801498

3963088,4,B002OOWKRQ,"I really enjoyed both season one and season two of this mini-series turned full blown series. After a phenomenal season two with a crazy finish, I had high expectations for the third and final season. I think the writers tried a little too hard on some of the plot lines. With new characters, the plot at times during season three is convoluted and discombobulated. There are still plenty of moments where the original characters shine through and are put in moments that made me as a fan fall in love with the show the first time.

In my opinion, the third season was not as strong as it could have been, especially compared to season one and two. As a fan of the BBC America Robin Hood series though, I still enjoyed it.",1265068800,2,722,4.428571428571429

Watch for yourself and decide.  Personally I loved Gisbourne's tragic story in this season and the development of his relationship with Robin.  Also Isabella was a fantastic character and Lara Pulver had great chemistry w/both Richard and Jonas.  Toby Stephens is the best Prince John ever.  And even Kate IMO wasn't as bad as most people seem to think, not the best character to be sure but she had some good moments.  The story remained riveting to the end, as always with a nice mix of drama and comedy and very clever dialog.  It's really too bad we didn't get a 4th season, I would have totally stayed tuned for the adventures of Robin, Guy and Archer.",1263859200,9,893,4.4753086419753085
3963090,5,B002OOWKRQ,"I was a bit skeptical when I read the previous reviews but I'm a fan of Richard Armitage so I was going to watch regardless. I followed it from the very beginning so I was going to watch it anyway. This is definitely a darker side of Robin Hood but a necessary one. It explains a lot of things but it also takes a turn into the relationship of Guy and Robin. One that would never be imagined. The Sheriff's return in the final episode is a SURPRISE for sure but necessary to end the series. Yes they all die, the sheriff, Guy and Robin. One sure way no one will take the series off on a stupid spin and start another series. It's a deep a tragic ending to Nottingham and all it's people. I cried my eyes out the way it all ended. I had formed an attachment to the 3 main characters, Guy especially. It was wonderful to see the dramatic change he went through in this season. This a must see if you've followed the series. You have to watch it to the end but please IGNORE Kate as she is useless, annoying and definitely an idiot that was just a girl to fill in the place of Djaq. It started out beautifully and ended beautifully.",1263600000,10,1129,4.136363636363637

Yes, this season had its flaws--some unlikable characters (Kate), lack of continuity in some of the stories, a less-than-happy ending, etc., but the superb acting and some very memorable and moving story lines made it worthwhile. So much to love about this series when you look past the negatives. Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisborne alone was enough to keep me watching! Can't get enough of the bad boy in black leather! He's simply breathtaking in this season as he sinks to the depths after killing Marian, then makes his slow and painful climb toward redemption. Best part of season 3,IMHO. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved the first two seasons!",1263254400,15,751,4.696969696969697
3963092,2,B002OOWKRQ,"When writer/director Minghella made the decision to kill off Maid Marian (Lucy Griffiths) at the end of S2, he also dealt a fatal blow to this series. RH began as a child's show but it was the Marian-Robin-Guy triangle that soon attracted the serious fangirls. Oh, to turn back the hands of time.

Instead S3 appears to have no memory of its past, no hope for its future and the principals casually drop in and out when apparently they don't have anything else to do.  This season should have really been called the Gisbornes as two new characters are introduced, apparently to replace departing cast members, but then the series didn't get renewed so while there are some abrupt resolutions, the remainder of the cast is left kinda hanging!

A campy Toby Stephens does a villainous cameo as the evil Prince John.  The grieving Guy receives a stunning make-over and finally gets a conscience.  Widower Robin (Jason Armstrong) gets buff, and a new girlfriend, Kate.  The poor viewer gets an astonishing back story to justify introducing Archer, an amalgam of Guy and Robin.  Heavens to Betsy!!

In Ep. 6, the tightly wound Guy finally snaps and engages in a vicious sword/knife fight with the Sheriff, his former mentor, that is a nail-biting worthy performance on both their parts.  Ep. 9 is probably the best written episode of the entire three seasons.

Armitage continues to carry the series and to see his beautiful Sir Guy in full fury with flashing eyes and flying tresses whenever one wishes is reason enough to buy this even if he is absent for two episodes.

3963093,4,B002OOWKRQ,"One big challenge of this season was to cope with the loss of Marian. As a number of people have noted, her death left a big emotional hole at the center of the show, one that Season 3 was never quite able to fill (despite Isabella). At the same time, it set up some fascinating storylines, particularly for Guy of Gisborne. Do I wish they hadn't killed Marian? Yes and no -- obviously, it depends on what sort of alternate Season 3 we would have gotten with Marian alive. I realize that for some people a ""Robin Hood"" without Robin and Marian is unthinkable, but I'm not one of those people. I also didn't mind the lack of a happy ending; many versions of ""Robin Hood"" do not end happily, and this version of RH was always pretty dark, IMO, despite its lighthearted moments.

With that in mind, here are my grades for the various components of this season....

(SPOILERS GALORE! YOU WERE WARNED...)

*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

A:

* Guy's character arc. It was fascinating to watch Guy grow a spine vis-a-vis the Sheriff. I liked the fact that his remorse and horror at what he has done does not immediately plunge him into a quest for atonement. Instead he becomes an even darker character for a while than he was in S1/2; he flails around, first seeking revenge against Robin and sinking deeper and deeper into self-loathing, then throwing himself back into ambition and the quest for power only to realize how empty that quest is, and hitting rock bottom before he can rediscover his humanity and reconnect to his love for Marian. I'm not a huge fan of the ""redemption by death"" motif, and (apparently unlike Richard Armitage) I don't care for the idea that Guy had to die at the end to pay for his crimes.  Personally I would have loved to see another season of Guy trying to live as a good man (and hopefully succeeding!), but maybe it is true that he could have only found peace in death; at any rate, if he had to die, I can't think of a better way for him to go.  I also liked the development of his principal relationships -- with Robin, Isabella, and Vaisey -- and the short but sweet storyline with Meg. I initially disliked the backstory with Guy's and Robin's families, but it has strangely grown on me.

* Prince John. Do you love me? Yes, we do, PJ, you slightly psychotic but irresistibly entertaining throne-usurper. Toby Stephens' version of Prince John was just perfect for the show, with exactly the right blend of camp and real menace. (The moment when he invites Guy to drink to killing Robin Hood and his own sister was genuinely terrifying.) Best villain next to Vaisey; I only wish we'd seen more of him.

* The lion. Ah, umm... just kidding.

B:

* Robin. I know some people have said that Robin didn't seem sufficiently affected by Marian's death after the first episode, but I have to disagree. I think this was definitely a more grown-up version of Robin than in the previous two seasons -- yeah, he still has his cocky moments with the adorable (or infuriating, depending on your take) smirk, but they're definitely fewer; he is no longer the boyish adventurer that nothing ever sticks to. Instead he is someone who now sees his hero status as a burden he can't escape. He's not always particularly attractive -- his treatment of Isabella is rather appallingly insensitive at times, IMO -- but he's a compelling character. The main reason Robin gets a B is because of Robin/Kate. I could have actually bought his relationship with Kate -- I can see that, after Marian, he's really no longer looking for true love, just for emotional and sexual comfort with a girl in the gang for whom he feels nothing more than affection -- but Kate's obnoxiousness, and the fact that Robin is having this fairly casual relationship with a girl that his very loyal friend Much is genuinely smitten with, really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

* The Robin/Guy storyline. In the absence of Marian, Robin and Guy are pretty clearly the show's main relationship (okay, probably not ""like that""...). The idea that these two are mirror images of each other and that Guy is ""Robin Hood manqu"" really comes to the fore this season. I really love pretty much everything about the progression of their relationship, except for the daddy ex machina contrivance of Lord Malcolm showing up out of nowhere at a key moment to inform the boys that they have a mutual half-brother they need to save from hanging.  I'm really torn, because while it's pretty clear at the start of the show that Robin and Guy did not know each other before (let alone have a complicated history), I've rather come to like the idea of their lives being entwined, and the backstory has grown on me (as has the character of Archer).  I don't particularly like how the show got there, but I like the end result. So, a B.  (By the way, I must really disagree with R.M. Fisher's assertion that Robin was never shown properly grieving for Marian because otherwise his friendship with Guy would have been too improbable.  His grief felt very real to me, and Guy's murder of Marian was brought up in both of the episodes that dealt with Guy and Robin becoming allies.)

* Isabella. A bit too Cruella de Ville by the end, but still overall a compelling character; her interactions with Guy in 3x13, including the final look at his dead body, redeem her somewhat in my eyes. I'm not sure what the writers intended, but to me she remained somewhat sympathetic to the very end; she is a woman who we know without a doubt (after 3x09) has been horribly abused, and I think she does have legitimate grievances against both Guy and Robin. I can understand why she'd go slightly nuts after Thornton's returns and Meg's betrayal, but I liked her better when she was opportunistic and clever with only a hint of instability, rather than slightly nuts.

* Vaisey. Watching him lose his grip on power was quite fascinating, as was the escalation of his conflict with Guy to an outright battle to the death; but his return in the finale was a bit of a disappointment.

* Much. He was very good when he got decent screen time, but there really wasn't enough of it, and it's kind of a shame that the main storyline he got was to pine for a girl who treated him like crap, clearly didn't merit his affection, and went after Robin. Much deserved much better. However, his A-caliber material and performance in the two-part finale elevates his overall S3 grade to a B.

* Tuck (B-). A character who started out very promising (to quote Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"", he could have been a contendah!) and then fell flat because of underdevelopment. He did get some meatier stuff to do in the two-part finale, at least, but there was a lot of unfulfilled potential there.

C:

* The underuse of Allan. I actually liked the Allan material at the end, and in the premiere -- but basically, in Ep 2-Ep 11, he's pretty much MIA (and I really did not like Sexist Allan in Ep 9). It's almost like, once his loyalty to the gang is no longer in question, there's nothing interesting for him to do. The lack of Guy/Allan material was especially unfortunate, given their rich history in Season 2. I'm not saying it's implausible that they would barely interact with each other once Guy joined the gang. I'm sure that Guy still had way too much resentment over Allan's betrayal in 2x12 while Allan would have worried that getting too chummy with Guy would remind the gang too much of his earlier betrayal, but all those are actually issues that could have been explored in very interesting ways if Guy and Allan were forced to deal with each other.

* The underuse of the gang in general, and the fact that so much of the gang time ended up being consumed by Kate. Which brings us to...

D:

* Kate! She had some okay moments, but for the most part, she really was a waste of screentime. Do I need to elaborate? Probably not.

So, my overall grade for the season... I would say a B-minus, because unfortunately, the D component took up a lot of space and time. There were definitely things I would have done differently; for one thing, lose the two Guy-less eps (which were not bad, but with only 13 episodes in a season I don't think the show could afford to do what were basically filler eps with regard to the main storyline), have Isabella show up and Guy return (hopefully sans lion) in Ep 3, and then move up the entire storyline so that there was more time for Guy's integration into the gang and the Guy and Robin Buddy Show. But ultimately there's no use crying over spilled milk or missed opportunities, and on the whole I'm pretty happy with a lot of what we got. Particularly since the finale sent out the show and the characters on a high, if tragic, note.",1262131200,20,8716,4.490208464939987
3963094,2,B002OOWKRQ,"Season one was pretty entertaining and season two was pretty good too.  A bit too politically correct at time and a few episodes were poor in taste and quality but, in general, quite an entertaining show and most were good.  Season 3 is a waste of time and effort.  The writers should (must) be replaced (was there a writers strike in the U.K.?  Must have been).  Still, I hope the failure of season 3 doesn't mean the end of the show but that they will go back to the beginning and miraculously bring back some key characters they've killed off (find a new Marian, Allan, etc.) and start over and kind of pretend season 3 never happened.  Hopefully, they'll go back to fun and somewhat realistic escapes and rescues and develop the characters they have and the comradery between them.  Season three is a waste but we'll see what the result will be.",1262044800,,849,4.509803921568627
3963095,3,B002OOWKRQ,"I don't have too much to add to the comments above, other than I think the actress who portrayed Kate probably did the best she had with the material she was given to work with, which was not much.  I agree with everyone that her and Isabella were completely unnecessary characters, brought in for female diversion with the killing of Marian in season 2.  Since this Robin Hood decided to take on soap opera plots, then would it have been less unreasonable to have Djaq and Will find some Middle Eastern whiz who was actually able to revive Marian and save her from her fatal wounds?  I KNOW - they did that at the end of season 1 - and maybe that might have seemed even sillier - then Marian would have been the unkillable girl or something.  BUT, That would have even made for a better television show than what was dished out this year- and then hers and Robin's return to England as a married couple and how they managed it with the rest of the gang might have made for much more interesting plot possibilities.  It couldn't have been worse than the Bobby Ewing/It was all the dream thing they did with Dallas in the past.  Surely they could have found an actress that looked and sounded enough like Griffiths to be a believable replacement.  I said this in one of the comments, but Robin taking up with both Isabella and then Kate so shortly after Marian's death made me think of Tommy Steele in Finian's Rainbow - when I'm not with the one I love, I love the one I'm with.

  Armitage, Jonas and Joe Armstrong, Sam Troughton and the rest do what they can with what they've been given to work with, and there are moments worth watching, particularly the episodes with Toby Stephens as Prince John, whose over the top performance was the most entertaining of the entire season in the episodes he appeared in, but the rest of the plots and characters were too irrational and too changeable to be entirely believable, unless, as I stated in the past, you want to believe that both Guy and his sister suffer from severe reactive attachment disorder or BPD which would explain their exceedingly changeable jeckyl/hyde behaviors to people as adults.  The episodes where Guy and Robin are shown that Guy's mother took up with Robin's father while Guy's father was believed dead from the Crusades, then returns unexpectedly as a leper, and Guy's mother, now expecting a child by Robin's father, has to make the decision to renounce/repudiate her husband when the society declares him unfit to live amongst others, might have been some cause for that, but there is no indication otherwise in the plot/backstory except for Guy's selling of his sister to a cruel man to marry which would have purportedly given her cause to become such a bloodthirsty, mood-swinging maniac.  The fans of this series could have written better plots, and indeed, the ladies who write fanfiction on the C19 armitage message board online have written better plots.  Even a dream sequence where Guy dreamed he was actually married to Marian instead of Robin, or letting the only truly interesting gal introduced this season, MEG, LIVE, and have a romance with Guy until the end - that might have made for more interest this year.  It is probably a microcosm of how bad the writers did this year that they did immediately kill off the only truly interesting female they came up with - Meg - the same episode they introduced her.  That actress resembled Griffiths' physicality enough that even SHE would have been a believable replacement as Marian, in my opinion.

It also bothered my husband and I that (1) Guy's illegitimate child by the maidservant from season 1 was never mentioned again; (2) the gal Much loved in the past was never brought back in the series (3) we thought the Saracen bow Robin had was brought back by him from his wars with King Richard and then all of a sudden his father has it with him when he's a boy?  Did the writers watch the other seasons at all?

  The throwaway death of Allan a Dale was also a complete tragedy.  All in all, what had been a very entertaining, watchable, brilliantly acted series died this year from bad writing/scripts.  It is a tribute to the marvelous acting prowess of this cast that they were able to give it as much entertainment value as it had from the silliness they were given to work with.",1260057600,12,4323,4.6015625

The rest don't really evolve much. I think that is another reason why this season seems to go downhill. It's just a lot of the same stuff. The sheriff does some bad stuff and Robin saves the day.

Losing Marian was a bad move. Tuck comes off as preachy. Kate is whiny. Archer? I don't know. I just don't like him. So why bother? Because of the last episode. It's a tear jerker. I watched it over and over. It gets me every time.",1483747200,,719,4.286764705882353
