My dad was wondering if it was a goof and a spoof, 9 it was not, more of 1337 (leet). Please purchase this and support indie films and ones that are of great value. Trust me Milana Jackson and Scot Silver are one duo you won't wanna miss!",1486771200,,365,3.8157894736842106

So MILAN JACKSON is a total hottie. 100% would take her to the red carpet for the next film release. She saved this film TBH. I would date her! Scot Silver has displayed how to strategically not pay actors in such a beautiful art piece. MILAN JACKSON you and me baby!

I recommend this film to anyone that likes a good adventure, and a hot babe Milan Jackson you have won my heart over.

Thanks SCOT!",1486684800,,518,4.385416666666667
8375915,1,B002O57J8K,Buying this movie is a waste of money. Watching it is a waste of time. Even Milan Jackson's breast implants can't keep this dud from falling flat on its face.,1281139200,2,158,4.3
8375916,4,B002O57J8K,"Dead Man on the Run is a fun family movie.  It's been my experience that children under 12 and adults over 40 enjoy this movie the most.  The movie has a good story line, but it doesn't have all the special effects teenagers and young adults are looking for.",1265068800,3,258,4.244897959183674
