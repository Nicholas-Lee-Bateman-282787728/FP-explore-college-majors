3556289,1,B001EMWYTS,"Here a tale that was told greatly and then put forth into a movie in even greater form has been destroyed by the 3rd and last. I found the story horrible the character that we have all come to know as L I felt was not even portrayed as L just a twisted form or the famous detective. The gist of this story is terrorist use a scientist to create a virus and a antidote the scientist commits suicide by the virus in one of the longest deaths I have ever seen(SERIOUSLY HE WOULD NOT DIE). He gives his daughter the answer to the antidote in a note book with math codes and she escapes to L, you can imagine how the rest goes as L dodges capture tries to figure out the antidote and stop the terrorist, as he discovers how much he would like to live ..........................
It was awful and I honestly wish i had not seen it.",1241395200,,824,4.124223602484472
3556290,5,B001EMWYTS,"I've read the reviews for this, and I have to say that I most definately don't agree with a large portion of the ones knocking it. I will admit that I have not seen the straight Japanese version subtitles, I saw the dubbed when it was in theaters, but I do not think that it was as bad as made out at all.

Yes, you have to get over the fact that he didn't fall in love in 23 days. You have to deal with the fact that Ryuk does not appear more than once for a minute or two. Yes, you have to deal with the fact that he didn't interact with any of the previous characters from the movies beyond Watari. But, hey, considering they either killed everyone or locked them up, what do you expect? Really, they weren't working with much, were they, guys, so cut the writers some slack. And for the love of everything sacred, white hair DOES NOT exist in your average child, so, no, the boy ""Near"" DOES NOT have it. Why is this even an honest complaint with the movie? Some realism was obviously desired, in the movie, after all... And what surprise would it have been to viewers in the end if the kid had white hair all along?

The movie does deal with the whole terrorism, plane chase, mad scientist aspect, but it wasn't stupidily written just to make fangirls squee. It makes sense. The boy, ""Near"", is just a tad bit annoying with his ""13-11, 13-11, 13-11, 13-11!!!"" thing, but beyond that... he's adorable and not much trouble. The girl (I do believe that her name was Maki, as well) was a bit more annoying than he was. But, all in all, it was L stuck, willingly, with two kids. There was cuteness abounds as he deals with that, but he also dealt with some of the problems of having a wanted child with him, since Maki was being hunted down by the mad scientists for the virus she had that was the weapon for the terrorists (these very same scientists). We got to meet two others from Whammy's group, too. K and F.

Honestly, the movie was very creative for the restraints that they were working with. They had to come up with a plot that could believably arise, get played through, and get resolved in only 23 days for the characters. They could not work in Light, or Misa, or the shinigamis. The FBI came back, back why made sense, too. (I'll be one of the first to admit that he was a total goober, but he was necessary for plot movement.) Don't let the fact that it didn't follow with romanticized ideals of what could have, ""should have"", happened in Ls last 23 days stop you from viewing this. My AMC experience had me raving to my entire group on my college campus, and the three other people who went with me were all agreed on the fact that it was, hands down, one of the best ways that they could have ended Ls life. He was, ultimately, doing what he loved in the end, even if it wasn't getting revenge using the Deathnotes, or wasn't out finding love. It's L, guys. He was all about fighting crime and being Justice. As soon as I can buy a copy where I can have the option to see it dubbed again, I will be doing so. You should do the same if you are a fan of the anime, manga, live action movies, or just loveable old L in general.

3556291,5,B001EMWYTS,"I just saw this movie last night (4/30/09) at the movies. Now I read what everyone else had to say and some of there opions i do agree with but they are all forgetting the simple fact. This movie was based on L's final 23 days. what they were trying to show is L being more active rather than just using his head. Of course this movie only touched up on the Death note for the first 30-45 mins from when L wanted to catch Keria to when he burned both misa and Lights death note. If you expecting or hopeing this movie would be something like the other 2 movies then your going to be very unhappy. I personily love the movie. It showed me how funny, strange,and smart L can really be. I can say this if you didn't like L in the other 2 movies this one will make you fall in love with him.

For What they were trying to show, I felt that this was a great movie. Death Note Fans will love this movie only if they take in out the aspect that this movies mainly has nothing to do with the death note but mainly with L, and Yes Near also the meaning behinde his name. Well that is just my take on the movie. I suggest you get it or rent it and come to your own view. But I say It is a must see.

Rest in Peace

I had a lot of scenarios in my head of what L's last 23 days might be like (in the live-action reimagination of Death Note's climax). But this was NOT one of them. And it's a shame. What possibilities. One could have been a ""love at last"" sort of story that lets us see L's past and heart a bit more. Or a more philosophical one, given his mind is free to do anything, freed from any fears, as death is inevitable. Or yes, a great last case.

This was supposed to be the great last case. It's the Great Last Lame Case. Crazed scientists. Terrorism. Dumb FBI. Ridiculous plane chase. Annoying little kid (Time Waster is right, this little boy actor got on my last nerve.)

The action/plot seems to be straight from some television grade B flick. If this didn't have Kenichi as L, a one-scene cameo with Ryuk, and a few moments with the charming presence of the actor who plays Watari, this would be a total waste of a Death Note fan's time.

But, okay, I have a devoted weakness for the wonderful creation that is L, and I'll even buy a DVD to get to see him. (Good price from DonutSTore and it got to me fast, so I recommend them from the sellers.)

Time Waster pretty much covered the essential critiques. This film tries to humanize L by setting him up as the protector to the two children in danger--""Near"" who is not at all like the Near in the manga/anime, and the virus-carrying cute little girl (Maki? forget her name) who's got the mad scientist conservationists on her heels. It ends up sort of silly-fying him more than anything.

Still Kenichi M, even with a very bad wig that doesn't exactly replicate the terrific manga/anime hair that L has, has presence as L. I really love watching him observe and think and eat sweets. The scene where he mourns Watari, with his moist eyes and vulnerable mouth, is very touching.

If you must watch this, be warned of the cheese and dorky factor. But really, I'm still glad I bought it to see L again, and my second viewing was pretty much with finger on remote to skip the non-L scenes. And, okay, I did like the very last line and shot. I'm a softie when it comes to L.

How sad that this is the film devoted to L. The possibilities squandered to do a truly high-quality follow-up with a plot worthy of L's mind and uniqueness.

3556293,2,B001EMWYTS,"Well judging from the cover this is a pretty interesting movie.  Wrong.  After sitting through this it needs more Ryuk, Less English, and Less Little Boy (Near in the making).

There's a village suffering from a plague that resulting is blood-and-pus spewing sores, the Americans come in and get some samples, then air-bomb the place.  One obnoxious little boy, Near, survives and goes to L.  While this is going on a member of Whammy House, who designed the virus, kills himself and tells his daughter to book it.  She meets up with L with the EVIL ORGANIZATION hot on her heels.  Confrontation.  L says something about little girls being his one weakness and grabs her.  It feels like they tried to make L look like an action hero in some of the shots, and he slouches way more than he should just so the little girl, Maki, can correct him on it. Some people die, more live, and only ONE SCENE had RYUK!!!

The few redeeming qualities of this film are the scenes between L and the kids and the Crepe mobile.  I would not buy this, rent it if you can, but do not buy.",1236643200,2,1068,4.3979591836734695

8298866,4,B001EMWYTS,"This is a fun movie with an extremely hot main character but its nowhere near as good as death note and has very little to do with the previous 2 movies.
id recommend it just to finish your collection",1344297600,,200,4.153846153846154

8298871,5,B001EMWYTS,"Of the three ""Death Note"" movies (even though ""L: Change the World"" doesn't actually involve the death note at all) this was the most entertaining.

8298873,5,B001EMWYTS,"An  instant favourite!
I like that they give hints to the other movies  so that if a person hasn't seen the others they still have a bit of an idea, more because I watched it with a friend who hadn't seen the others yet.
It shows another side to the  idea of a shinigami.
Very well done.
and I thought it was kinda funny that a bit of it was spoken in English",1244332800,,359,3.8904109589041096

I have done much business with this store, and will continue to do as much business with them as my little purse will allow. VERY happy with this product!!!!!",1241568000,,380,4.291666666666667
