8081668,1,B000B5XP1A,"There's a line in the movie where Julian Sands says:

I think somethings burning.

Too bad it wasn't the script. How Julian Sands wound up in this terrible terrible movie is unbelievable. It's cliched. It's shallow. It's unbelievably badly written. There are moments when it was so bad i had to change the channel.

Fans of sands are better off watching a re-run of room with a view.",1153008000,,383,4.602941176470588
8081669,1,B000B5XP1A,This movie is terrible.  It is about two men who are friends.  One teaches at Princeton and heads to Vegas for a conference.  His best friend asks him to try to see if he can find his daughter for him while he is there.  The teacher finds the daughter who is now a prostitute.  He ends up sleeping with her and falling in love with her.  This is the worst love story I have ever seen.,1143763200,6,384,3.986842105263158
8081670,3,B000B5XP1A,"Packard Schmidt (Julian Sands) is a college professor whose forte is English literature.  We first meet him in the classroom where he is writing out a poem on the black board.  When only one student shows up he decides to end class early.  Eventually we will find out why the professor and his students have established this strange state of affairs.  But Packard has more pressing concerns as he heads off to a Milton conference in Las Vegas (be fair: where would you want to go to an academic conference on the works of John Milton?).  One of the few colleagues in his department who tolerates him, Frank Iverson (John Savage), asks him to track down his daughter in Sin City.

This seems a reasonable enough request.  But when Packard tracks down Sally Iverson (Katharine Towne), he finds her in one of Nevada's legal brothels.  This throws him for a loop and he reports back to Frank that he was unable to find Sally.  Then he has a run of good luck at the craps table (his strategy reflecting something of his personality if you want to make that connection), hooks up with an Elvis impersonator (James Belushi), and decides that what he should do with his winnings is to pay for an hour with Sally.

I do not want to suggest that Packard falls in love with Sally, because despite his professions of such feelings they ring hollow, as do most things in his life.  Besides, it is not their session at the brothel but rather her impromptu dance later on in front of a mirror, where we do not really see her (I have a suspicion that Towne had a double for the nude scenes that I am unable to shake) that turns her into a siren.  Both the good news and the bad news is that Sally agrees to go back to visit her dad, which proves to be an across the board disaster.  Yet, it may well be that this is not a bad thing given what a wasted life Packard has been living.

Packard's character stars off at a distance from us because he is not really a sympathetic figure and he clearly crosses a line when he sleeps with Sally.  It does seems to shake him from his lethargy, which is a good thing, but the fact that his stock ends up rising because there are worse characters in the film (and in Sally's life) sort of makes him a hero by default.  Sands and Towne turn in fine performances, but Savage and Belushi are forced to play out there because of their characters and that ends up making what happens in this film a bit too bizarre to accept as an appropriate morality play.

This film originally aired as ""Easy Six"" and is based on Edward Allen's novel ""Mustang Sally.""  The latter makes sense, given Sally's name is Sally, but I cannot figure out why ""Easy Six"" makes sense as anything other than a typo.  However, it will not keep me up at night trying to make sense of it and if somebody (a) watches this movie and (b) figure it out, then I am sure I will here about it and can revise the above accordingly.",1134000000,3,2912,4.319852941176471

Don't waste your time or money.  One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.",1133913600,4,107,4.0476190476190474
