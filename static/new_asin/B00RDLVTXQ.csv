6928717,3,B00RDLVTXQ,It is a lovely yoga practice. I am recovering from an injury and am restricted to non weight bearing practice so this worked for me. One thing that I missed during this practice was music;  - just my personal preference to have music to practice to.,1423440000,7,249,4.413043478260869
6928718,3,B00RDLVTXQ,It does not having you doing that many different moves.,1419120000,6,55,4.6
6928719,5,B00RDLVTXQ,This is perfect for me.  I feel 2 inches tall and so relaxed and calm when finished. My legs get the stretch they need to accommodate the other treadmill exercise I do.,1418860800,16,168,4.25
6928720,5,B00RDLVTXQ,Liked the dvd really like yoga and this is what I do at the yoga class,1415404800,3,70,3.4375
6928721,5,B00RDLVTXQ,Very nice presentation.  Sarah narrates as she demonstrates the Yoga positions.  What's amazing is that the narration is a voice over and it is synchronized perfectly with Sarah's movements.  I wasn't doing the Yoga I was just viewing the tape to make sure it wasn't defective.  Her voice is so soft and relaxing to listen to I almost fell asleep.  Of course the red wine I was drinking might have contributed to that.,1414713600,41,418,4.671232876712328

6928725,3,B00RDLVTXQ,"This was a little too gentle for me.  The main reason I need chair yoga is with arthritic hands, its is hard to support myself with my hands with the floor exercises for too long.  This was more stretching, which never hurts anyone.  I wish I could find a ""happy medium.""",1518739200,,271,4.2745098039215685

6928745,4,B00RDLVTXQ,"I bought this for my 85 yr old neighbor. She said she likes it. I tried it & felt it was nice, the sunflowers in the background are nice, her directions are clear, and the whole recording is done sitting down. Sometimes chair yoga is done standing with the chair as a support. I would recommend this. It also has
a guided meditation section.",1491177600,7,341,4.34375
6928746,5,B00RDLVTXQ,Amazingly good.  I didn't expect to get this good of a yoga workout from sitting in a chair.  I've been doing this with a friend who just had a total knee operation and can't do our usual yoga routine.  She loves it too.  Great stretches.  Beautiful scenery.,1491177600,4,258,4.404255319148936
6928747,5,B00RDLVTXQ,"I am 70 and work with a group of women older than me. We have all 'attempted' yoga but it is too much. This DVD is out of this world. The only trouble we all have with it is crossing our legs. However, we have found that we get the same stretch and results by just crossing our ankles and doing the stretch. This exercise is WONDERFUL.",1487289600,23,335,4.014925373134329

I wanted to start back up with Yoga but knew a regular Yoga program would be too difficult for me right now and I would not want to stick to it then.  This DVD is perfect.  It has every movement other regular Yoga tapes have but done in a modified manner with a chair and with gentleness and good direction.  Most tapes that say they are ""gentle"" aren't I have found, but this one is and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice medium session not too strenuous and  not to easy.",1472169600,7,649,4.062992125984252

6928762,5,B00RDLVTXQ,"Gentle Chair Yoga with Sarah Starr is the most gentle and effective yoga I have ever tried and done without straining, very effective in stimulating the muscles and organs, I felt the difference immediately afterwards.  At my age (??) joints and muscles begin to ache after sitting for a short while no matter how much exercise you do or get from daily tasks and running around here and there.  I had no idea how much relief could be received from simple movements of specific areas of the body.  I didn't have to dance around vigorously or make sudden twists and turns, hop or march around like other videos I've seen and bought.  I didn't become exhausted afterwards that I needed to rest instead after I finished the short but so...relaxing and what I know say is therapeutic yoga  got up to do my daily tasks with ease and no pain.",1462752000,8,835,4.54

6928765,5,B00RDLVTXQ,"I had done yoga years ago; recently my stress, backaches and knotted up, stiff muscles made me decide to try yoga again. I bought 3 Rodney Yee beginners dvds to try and even these beginner routines were too tough. In my online research, I discovered 'chair yoga' (which to be honest, I thought was ONLY for disabled, elderly, or overweight people who couldn't get down on a mat)..I checked out various dvds and bought 2 of Sarah Starr's. I did this one today; and I LOVE IT. I don't miss the music not being played, the sunflower scenery is LOVELY.  She is so gentle, her voice is soft and this really stretches and loosens me up. I hope to 'graduate' to using Rodney Yees' someday; but these chair yoga practices work very well. (and I've changed my mind about chair yoga! ) I WILL buy more of hers down the road and enjoy becoming more flexible, less stressed and feeling better!",1458950400,89,881,4.472049689440993

6928767,5,B00RDLVTXQ,This is a great half hour work out that is manageable for people who need the chair for yoga. The sunflower field gives one an energized and happy feeling. Well worth the money. I attend deep water aerobics 3 times weekly and a one hour chair yoga class once a week. This DVD gives me an opportunity to stay limber on off days from the Y and is helpful if the weather is bad and I have to give up my class at the Y.,1457136000,5,415,3.8941176470588235
