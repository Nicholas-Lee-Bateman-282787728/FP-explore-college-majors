5309836,5,B009AVCALC,Stumbled across this 12 part series by accident flipping through the channels. Immediately hooked. Downside is: If I watch the entire thing today the final episode will start at 5 p.m. Was thinking about DVR but in all honesty this looks like one to have on DVD. Will definitely buy this and plan a day to sit down and watch in its entirety from start to finish. Maybe one of those rainy days when its cold outside. Simply make a PotRoast or similiar hearty winter meal and veg out watching this series all day. Will watch as much as I can today but will be difficult with NFL games coming on soon.,1350172800,6,598,4.348214285714286

5309978,5,B009AVCALC,"Having seen every Titanic-related movie and documentary made, I still enjoy this dramatic spin on the back-story of the era of the building of the liner. It's great to see it all as a DVD, where on TV it was broken-up into a mini-series. This story is mostly history-accurate, and the sets and costumes are first-rate. This is a perfect addition to anyone's collection of Titanic related history!",1476230400,,396,4.838235294117647

5309981,5,B009AVCALC,"Everyone knows how the story ends.  On the evening of April 14th, 1912,  the R.M.S. TITANIC collided with an iceberg.  The damage from the collision caused flooding which could not be contained.  Eventually, TITANIC sank in water 2 miles deep at a latitude of 41 degrees 46' and a longitude of 50 degrees 14'.  It is a story emblematic of human arrogance, human ignorance and injustice:  most all of the rich people on the cruise ship survived while most all of the poor passengers perished.

This is the backstory to the construction of the TITANIC.  While I knew a few fragments of the story, this is a ""deep dive"" into the sundry mistakes that were made before ship ever hit the water.  Note:  the production is accurate about some of the design flaws (i.e.:  the watertight bulkheads did not reach up to the weather decks, and the ship simply had far too few lifeboats) but the premise that the steel used on the ship was inferior is simply not true.

That said, this is a drama, not a docudrama and as such it is an ambitious and well done project.  The story centers around something of a fictional Cassandra engineer named Mark Muir (played by Kevin Zegers) who consistently warns whomever will listen that TITANIC is not nearly as safe as it should be.  The casting is top notch as Zegers is a dashing young actor who reminds me a bit of Clark Gable.  The series introduces us to the earliest invocation of a field we now know as metallurgy (whether the true genesis of metallurgy corresponds to this exact time period, I admit I do not know).

The rest of the cast is exceptional & includes the legendary Derek Jacobi as Lord Pirrie, the chief of the shipyard.  Alessandra Mastronardi is superb as the demure Sophia.  Sophia provides something of a calming effect on the tension that permeates that storyline.  Chris Noth has the requisite domineering screen presence to portray J.P. Morgan.

While TITANIC is the center of gravity of the story (obviously), the series also gives us a glimpse into many other aspects of the time period such as the rise of worker's unions, women's suffrage and the friction between the Catholics  & Protestants.  The recent release of the series is prescient as these days Donald Trump & his supporters want to ostracize Muslims just as the Protestants wanted to subjugate the Catholics.  Substitute ""Muslim"" for ""Catholic"" and it's sad to say that little progress has been made in religious tolerance in the 100+yrs since the TITANIC was built.

This is a great series which offers a whole lot of history.  Again, not all of it is true, but it does give the viewer a ""feel"" for what everyday life was a century ago in Belfast.  Unlike most unrated series, this 1 is family friendly.  As such, it is encouraged that families watch it together to learn about a very important epoch of history.",1475193600,,2834,4.661290322580645
5309982,4,B009AVCALC,"Although this is a fictional story built around the building of the Titanic, the historical inaccuracies are significant. Other than that, it is a very good show.",1474416000,,162,5.037037037037037

5310024,5,B009AVCALC,Many programs have been made about that Titanic. This is the first program that detailed all the problems that went into the construction of the ship. I just liked the way the program was made and filmed. I liked that it was made in Europe. Seemed more realistic.,1472601600,,263,4.5
5310025,5,B009AVCALC,Really loved the first season!  The subject is very popular and this has given the period even more insight as to what was happening at this time in history.  Hope there are more episodes to come!,1470873600,,196,4.416666666666667

5310030,5,B009AVCALC,I enjoyed it and learned a great deal of about the religious struggle in Northern Ireland.  Too bad that it came only as a part of a Starz subscription which I will only renew when the next season of Outlander airs on Starz.,1470700800,,224,4.209302325581396

5310098,5,B009AVCALC,"I thought I knew much about this subject, but the amount of historical detail including information about rivets and other operational decisions driven by greed and circumstances absolutely fascinated me.  I liked the love story and the characters.  I never have thought of immigrants coming to Ireland at that time, except from the UK.  I recently have had surgery and I have to say this wonderful series really helped me to get through a most difficult week.  Since it is being called ""Season 1,"" does that mean there will be a ""Season 2?""  I was so afraid that all were merely sailing off into the horror we know awaits them and that was that!",1468713600,3,646,4.631578947368421

5310101,5,B009AVCALC,Excellent historic story.  I wish there were more shows like this that show actual history mixed with a good set of fictional as well as characters who really existed.  The show brings out the huge task of bringing the Titanic to life.  It shows the lives of those who did the physical labor of building the most well known ship of all time and the lives of those behind the creation of Belfast's biggest ship.,1468540800,3,410,4.44

5310138,5,B009AVCALC,"Great  movie.  I especially like the character played by Derick Jacobi, wonderful acting.  The movie was put together in the fashion of the old days with grandeur, a large cast of characters and a huge set.  There are many plots and sub-plots throughout the movie.  A couple characters, Sophie in particular, don't seem to be consistent in their actions and persona.  It's in the writing not in the acting I would say.  The costumes were beautiful and the structure and set of the Titanic as she was being built was huge.  Great movie.  Highly recommended.",1443139200,5,556,4.768421052631579

From the start, the focus is on Titanic - which is fine, since this is called ""Titanic: Blood and Steel"". However, Titanic was not the focal point of the White Star Line's efforts or Harland and Wolff's. She was not slated to be the biggest ship in the world. What's that you say, but she was? She was not intended to be any larger than her sister, Olympic. All early promotions and claims of the largest ship ever were for Olympic, not Titanic. What I don't understand is why this is the case? Construction of Olympic started first as well as design. All research, material analysis, etc had been done for Olympic and carried over for Titanic and Britannic. Olympic was built by the same people as Titanic at roughly the same time, so surely the dramatic points of this series could have at least attempted to be on the ball here.",1409270400,,950,4.56140350877193

5310281,4,B009AVCALC,"We really enjoyed this historical drama about the people and times of the building of the Titanic. It gave us a better understanding of the world many of the immigrants to Americans during this time were running from.
The characters were well defined and believable.
Unfortunately, this being the only season left us with a bitter-sweet feeling which I hope explains 4 not 5 stars. But I would recommend watching it anyway.",1405987200,,423,4.888888888888889

5310284,5,B009AVCALC,"This series hooked me immediately.  I think the characters are wonderful.  A good series needs likable characters/actors, good story, good production values, and a good director.  This one has it all.  It's essentially an historically-based drama/soap opera -- but a darned good one.  I can't wait until they put season 2 on prime.  (Too many good things for free on netflix, prime, etc. for me to pay to watch season 2)",1404950400,,420,4.845070422535211
5310285,5,B009AVCALC,Well established intertwined characters fill this story of life in Ireland during the construction of the Titanic. This story delves into the class system during the era. Great show.,1404864000,,182,5.310344827586207

5310287,2,B009AVCALC,"I just did not enjoy it.  I usually enjoy historical dramas, but this one was very soap-opera like and was very slow in development.  I was disappointed with it.  I felt like Dr. Muir was a bit of a prat and it took away from my enjoyment of the whole thing.  It felt like there were so many different storylines going on, that I had a hard time figuring what the series was about.  Was it about political and religious strife in Belfast?  Was it about the class differences between the poor and rich?  Was it about the war and spies?  Was it about a bunch of hopping in the sack with little regard for the consequences?  Or was it about this ship, what was it called again, oh yeah, the Titanic...

Spoiler Alert:

Dr. Muir's lack of morals was put into the spotlight when he found out that he was father to a child whose mother died in childbirth and he spent a ton of time looking for the daughter he lost.  This, however, did not stop him from sleeping with yet another girl he was not married to, Sofia.  And, funny enough, Sofia's sister's unplanned pregnancy did not keep her out of the sack with Dr. Muir.  I am not one to judge harshly on such things normally, but these things did not seem to work together for me.  They knew how babies were made, right?

I just felt like it was a waste of my time.  I watched all of it in the hopes that it would get better at the end, but in the last two episodes we had montages and drama, and somehow all main characters with the exception of the rich Lord and the two parents of the Irish and Italian families got on the boat.  Just a guess, everyone died.",1404691200,,1605,4.172638436482084

5310294,5,B009AVCALC,"While not all the characters are real, this was an interesting series taking you behind the scenes of the building of Titanic.

5310298,2,B009AVCALC,"Overall, the cast, acting and the visuals are great.  However, the writing is pretty weak.  Also, the plot diverges from reality in an way that does not add anything and actually is distracting.  It seems that if you are doing a historical story that has a lot of documented information, that you should only invent that which is unknown (dialog, side stories, etc) or just go nuts (aliens attack the titanic, the iceberg was a giant submarine, etc) or just make a fictional boat.",1402617600,,480,4.690476190476191
5310299,4,B009AVCALC,"Then Titanic was such a tragic event - after watching this series you will see why from beginning to end it was doomed..
If you are a Titanic 'buff' there is one thing to keep in mind - the lives of all aboard that ship that perished - some times we get lost in the whys & hows and forget the souls of 1500 who perished because of human error.
The series outlines some important facts that just are not talked about in movies showing that awful night in April. The shipyard where she was born was in itself a tragedy of human suffering - where class against class showed all of it's ugly wares.
The casting for this series was spot on with all characters bringing to life what must have a time of uncertainty, pride and disgust.
Having sailed many times with the current cruise lines we offer in the 21st century it's remarkable that this ship has influenced modern day travel. (thanks for the correct number of life boats to passengers)  But let's not forget that even today many lives are lost at sea.
It's man against nature and we all know how that can end...
Only 4 stars because there should have been a season 2.",1402531200,,1119,4.328571428571428

5310301,5,B009AVCALC,"What a great combination of history and Hollywood.
The actors were so wonderful. My husband and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.
I was sad when it was over, especially knowing the fate of the Titanic.

For those who might complain that it is historically inaccurate, or minimizes the strife of the Irish people during that time in history....Get over it, it's an entertaining story and worth watching.",1402272000,,294,5.125
5310303,5,B009AVCALC,My only complaint is that there is only one season! I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional series about the building of the Titanic. The characters that were real were wonderfully woven into this story.,1402272000,,199,5.0606060606060606

Interesting history and really good actors/actresses. I haven't finishe the 1st season but so far so good! I didn't really get into a serious since Spartacous, so I guess that's saying a lot since Spartacous is the best serious ever for me. I recommend it",1401667200,,401,4.506849315068493

5310310,3,B009AVCALC,"Not sure how accurate the history is (especially the details), but the series does a great job of illuminating the conditions (physical, social, political and religious) in Belfast at that time.  It has helped me to understand the modern history of the UK much better.

I truly enjoyed it and since I am doing a Trans-Atlantic crossing east leaving Friday the 13th no less I thought I'd get it and watch it one more time. Perhaps I was looking for some tips in the event of a problem on the ship! The characters are developed throughout the story and the labor and ethnic issues of the times are presented, as well as, corporate greed and other large company issues. Not sure much has changed over the years but great series just the same. Highly recommend!",1400716800,,596,4.191304347826087

5310314,5,B009AVCALC,"This was a very enjoyable historical fiction, set in the Belfast shipyard as HMS Titanic was being built.

You should be aware that it is also a glossy tribute to all causes socialistic and ""progressive."" As long as you know that going in, and don't take the story as anything more than what it is -- very slanted historical fiction -- it is very enjoyable.  Watch, but take it is a not-completely-true tale...at the very least, it carefully omits facts that would be inconvenient to the progressive movement.

What was most enjoyable about the film was the gritty context of pre-WW1 Belfast.  Labor vs. business.  Catholics vs. Protestants.  Rich vs. Poor.  Elite leisure classes s vs. the heavily-burdened working classes.  Lots of dirty, grusome realities ARE depicted with honesty...it's just that only half of the tale is presented.

For the most part it isn't racy, with the exception of a tarty rich girl who can't/won't keep her knickers on, will only marry for money, cheats on boyfriend/fiance, plans to cheat on her husband, and pretty much throws herself at any male that isn't her fiance.  But 99% of that is verbal, only a bit of flesh gets flashed.  Probably not for below age 12, IMHO.

When your teens watch it...make sure they understand that it is a very one-sided perspective on history.  Talk it over with them...give them some facts.  For example, the labor/union movements also utilized extremely violent tactics...not just the rich businessmen.  Yes, there were German spies in pre-WW1 Europe...but none that actually worked for JP Morgan.  Yes, the labor unions were much needed to bring some balance to the business vs. labor relationship...but today's balance is very much out of whack the other direction (as evidence by the fleecing taxpayers received in bailing out GM).

While the show ends with the Titanic just starting its infamous maiden (and final) voyage, you should also take the opportunity to discuss some of the realities of that sinking, and how the truth generally differs from the oft-filmed discrepancies.  Explain, for example, that many tales about the Titanic's sinking--such as the oft-repeated claims that the steerage passengers were locked below decks--are purely myth, with zero foundation in truth.  Remind them that by overwhelming ratios, men--rich and poor alike--stood aside and ensured ""women and children first"" into the lifeboats; even as those men realized they would be dead within hours/minutes, they stood their ground and died heroically.

Yes, I'd watch it again.  Yes, I recommend it (I did rate it at 5 stars, after all).  Just understand the biases inherent in the series, and utilize them as a take-off point for discussions within your family.",1400284800,,2715,5.081264108352144
5310315,5,B009AVCALC,I love this mini series on the making of the Titanic.  It gave me insight on what the people of that time had to endure to survive and how the American dream was very real to them back then.  I am sure they mixed fact with fiction but being a Titanic lover it didn't matter to me.  It kept my interest to the very end.,1400284800,,318,3.8615384615384616

5310345,5,B009AVCALC,"Love the characters and the story,  learned so much about the people behind the Titanic ....I wish there was more.  Better than Downton Abby",1395705600,,140,4.791666666666667
5310346,4,B009AVCALC,I would have liked the series continue including the disaster of the Titanic.  Actors and actresses were excellent in their roles.,1395446400,,130,5.190476190476191
5310347,5,B009AVCALC,Awesome show. Love all the actors. The story about what was happening Belfast and the steel companies. Very interesting story about how  titantic was built,1395446400,,155,5.2
5310348,3,B009AVCALC,"Despite the fascinating juxtaposition of labor woes and big business interests, all set against the impending Titanic tragedy, this series holds little interest.",1395360000,,161,6.043478260869565
5310349,4,B009AVCALC,Very good! Really enjoyed it! I'm a guy and felt it was not cheesy at all. Represented the time and place well with great acting and great characters.,1395273600,,150,4.392857142857143
5310350,5,B009AVCALC,This is fabulous. Thought I had seen enough of Titanic EVERYTHING. Not true. The actors are all so good you forget they're acting. The scenery is wonderful. The plot pulls you in and you just want to keep going until the whole season is over. Then your sad when you can't watch more because the season is over...kinda like a great book you never want to end. I hope there is a second season because I just can't get enough.,1395273600,,423,4.3
5310351,3,B009AVCALC,"I loved this series, and thought it was such a fresh take on the Titanic story. Like so many people who have commented, it's a little lose in its historical treatment of the subject. Nevertheless, it does try to paint the picture that the Titanic disaster was a complex event with many variables that played into it. The acting was great. The effects were great. The Belfast accents were even pretty good. My only complaint was that it could have been a lot shorter. I wish there would be a part 2, but then again we all know how this story ends!",1395100800,,546,4.362745098039215

5310353,5,B009AVCALC,"Highly recommend this mini-series.  A lot to digest in this one, didn't want it to be over.  This covers the time before Titanic sails where politics, class distinction, and greed are things that are considered, that most of us don't reckon as we think of the actual tragedy.",1395014400,,275,4.708333333333333

5310356,5,B009AVCALC,"This was a great drama series with great actors. It is too bad they only made 1 season, but then again there isn't much of a story to tell other than the titanic sinking.",1394755200,,170,4.029411764705882

5310358,5,B009AVCALC,"I enjoyed this very much. I liked the twist and romance and overall good acting. I could relate to these people and their hard times. My only complaint would be I wish there was at least 1 if not 2 more episodes. Although I would have loved to see a few more seasons too. The last episode left me at a spot where I wanted to see what happened next. I guess I expected the show to last up to the sinking. By the way, I found this 1 week ago and watched the whole thing in 4 days. I've never done that before but I was so addicted I just had to see what was going to happen next.",1394582400,,577,3.816666666666667
5310359,5,B009AVCALC,This was very interesting series about designing the Titanic before she sailed. .  Would watch again I was totally glued...,1394582400,,123,5.15
5310360,5,B009AVCALC,"More often than not, everyone who sees a movie title with Titanic included expects some twist built around the ships passage and the sinking.  This was a very well executed story of the intensity of tensions between the Catholics and Protestants as they attempted to ""climb the mountain"" as they created the design, engineering, and then built  the world's largest ship.

Character development was compelling.  Everyone had their own individual hope and even a collective hope in the potential uniting opportunity for Ireland.  Their projection of Titanic as a part of a new life was very compelling.  That convergence of hope in the last episode with a cast we had come to know was very emotional.  The visuals throughout were superb and compelling and from the start allowed us the almost immediate opportunity to ""join in"" with the experience as if we were in some way with the characters.

  You will hope for a season 2 but clearly with further reflection I believe that you will be satisfied that this would have watered down the range of experience and connection with the characters.  Beautifully cast and beautifully acted.  We savored the experience despite the reality of the Titanic's tragedy.  It was more compelling to learn of the amazing impact to the thousands of people who conceived and built the ship than it's fateful demise. Enjoy",1394496000,,1352,4.955555555555556

5310376,3,B009AVCALC,"T: B&S is a good mini series which aired in the centennial anniversary year of the Titanic's sinking. While it's not a great series (say, on a par with ""Downton Abbey"", but then few are), it is engaging enough and kept me watching. Actor Derek Jacobi shines as Lord Pirrie and there are many other solid performances but actors I don't know as well. My least favorite character was the Italian woman, Sofia, who falls in love with Dr. Muir (Kevin Zegers). Actress Alessandra Mastronardi was good as Sofia, but her character, as written, was selfish and brooding. If I were Doc Muir, I would have happily dispatched her as a Steerage Class passenger aboard Titanic--alone. This character shows little love for man as he searches for his lost daughter; she is self absorbed in her career daydreams. Ugh. A turn off to most men even in 2012. Actress Ophelia Lovibond as Kitty is oh, so very sexy with her libertine sexuality that comes out behind the Belfast carnival tents. She's fun, froth and sex. Now I was surprised how much I came to like the character of revolutionary Emily Hill, the fiery Irish suffragette (played by talented Charlotte Bradley). I didn't especially like her radical politics (even for 1912; I would have been voted against Home Rule had I lived there), but I liked her moxie and free spirit. Ms. Bradley plays this with skill and is a scene stealer. Ultimately, what kept me from giving this series four stars is for the many historical errors (which could have been easily corrected yet weren't--that's just sloppy moviemaking). ""Artistic license"" shouldn't mean you make history up, or alter it, as you go along. No matter, it is a very good series and I don't want to scare you away from enjoying it, even the hardcore Titanic enthusiasts. (For details about the various historical errors, please see the excellent Wikipedia article about the series.)",1392249600,,1878,4.817337461300309

I got caught up in the people's lives and how hard it must have been to live in that time - it surely made me glad that I am living now. I wish they had gone on with the voyage and that we could have seen how many of them survived the journey. Although these were mostly fictional characters in this story, they represent the real people who lived or died, and it makes me sad to think that many who were left behind lost almost their whole family.",1390867200,,610,4.222222222222222

5310385,5,B009AVCALC,"Along with many other people, I've seen the footage of Robert Ballard's exploration of the wreck of the Titanic. It's a fascinating look at the past and reminder that human beings will never best Mother Nature. Watching the ROV's exploring the great ship at the bottom of the ocean, it is very easy to forget that more than 1500 people perished on that cold, dark night.

Titanic Blood and Steel is a re-imagining of the people behind the design and building of the Titanic. The characters portrayed were real,  but the story itself was fiction. It is important to remember that as you view this series. It was an important look at the social and economic conditions in Belfast at the time. The acting was top notch. It was a pity that it ended so abruptly.",1390694400,,757,4.5588235294117645

5310414,5,B009AVCALC,This was a wonderful miniseries I happened upon it accidentally and couldn't have been more thrilled to watch it.

Different perspective on the Titanic story.
What was going on laborwise in the shipyard, and in Belfast society brought perspective to story.

Not sure how true to life these people are, but at least labor strikes at the shipyard & management's reaction didn't get too p.c.  Shouldn't be a surprise to people that there's a big-time class system in Europe & guess what, the Irish Roman Catholics are at the bottom of the pecking order! Think most Irish learned long ago that life's not fair, especially if someone buys you passage on the Titanic's maiden voyage.

This series deals with the nuts and bolts of shipbuilding, and dramatizes the lives of the wealthy and impoverised people involved in Titanic's construction. It has an excellent international cast who display a high level of acting prowess. The details include modern analyses of how the great ship was imprudently designed such that the term ""unsinkable"" was unfounded and unfortunate.",1380844800,,491,5.215189873417722
5310474,5,B009AVCALC,"This is a beautiful series that not many know of. It should be recognized and well awarded. Although there are some historical inaccuracies, I found the drama and the story line to fit very well. Some of the characters, besides Andrews, were not marked in history, such as the wroking class families, but I found their role very important to represent the overall life and struggle. Making the voyage to the New World all the more credible and inspiring. I found myself caring for these characters and hoping for them to have  a better life. Then knowing they boarded the Titanic, made the tradegy all the more real and devastating. This is a great portrayal of the passengers of the ship and the reality of love, family, hope for a better life, the life of the rich, the outcome of the selfishwith an extraordinary cast. I highly recommend this series, and I encourage all to request for another season. Since the came so close to reality, it would be nice to see the impact that followed the Titanic. As we all know was a great one, that is why we know of it today.",1380412800,,1067,4.5

5310487,4,B009AVCALC,"I stumbled on this and I am glad I did.  It is, in my opinion, a well made docu-drama about the building of the Titanic.  The characters in the story are believable and it also encompasses a bigger part of the history of the shipyard, the union battle, the political drama over Home Rule, the unheeded calls, real or not, that led to the disaster, etc.  My only complaint is the blurring of the passage of time.  Once started, it is easy to stay hooked and become involved in the lives of the characters but always knowing what the ending will be gives it a bit of sadness.  There are also a lot of embedded actual footage of the ship itself which adds to the authenticity.  I did learn something I didn't know before.  There was a second ship on the drawing board after Titanic--Gigantic.  .",1380240000,,792,4.376712328767123

5310515,5,B009AVCALC,"Titanic Blood and Steel Season I puzzles me. Although shot in a number of locations (Ireland, Serbia) that subsidized production costs to some extent, and that are much less costly than California, the high quality of the production values, the writing, and the acting (much of the latter from unknowns who likely have significant careers ahead of them) is astonishing. This still must have cost a fortune to make with little prospect of a financial return commensurate with the risk.

This series demonstrates that some of the best works are now being produced for television distribution. [The series is far too long for a feature film.]

The writing highlights the geopolitical and social issues of the U.K. and Northern Ireland in the early decades of the last century. While the social issues are well known, the geopolitical issues, particularly the attempts by Germany to provoke civil discord in Northern Ireland through its support of the organizations that later became the Irish Republican Army, and the class divisions over the seemingly benign (from a 21st century perspective) issue of ""home rule"" (whether the Irish were capable of ruling themselves and the extent to which they should be allowed to participate in England's decisions affecting them) are more obscure to all but academic historians. This work is historically well-researched.

Moreover, the series deals with the substantive design and manufacturing flaws that led to the ultimate tragedy - the sinking after collision with an iceberg in the North Atlantic on the ship's maiden voyage. The writers were obviously familiar with the most current academic engineering research on the Titanic incident, which is effectively woven into the plot in a manner comprehensible to viewers without any background in engineering or metallurgy. This, alone, is an amazing accomplishment.

 Even the presentation of the White Star Line's precarious business position vis-a-vis the Cunard Line, its competitor, is very well done. The presentation of the labor/management disputes are even-handed and - surprisingly for a work written for the screen - deal with the substantive ethical and financial dilemmas faced by each side. All of this is easily understood by the lay viewer without expertise in business or finance.

Notwithstanding the wealth of knowledge and information the series provides, it is exactly what it should be - very entertaining. The characters are well rounded and engaging. The writing shines. The program moves along while juggling numerous sub-plots and historical and engineering details.

Finally, I noted with interest that Tom Clancy had a significant role in the production of this picture. If his contribution was as significant as it seems to have been, this work shows that he has research skills that reach far beyond the military/industrial complex, late 20th century history, and the intelligence community. Mr. Clancy may well have a future in motion pictures in different genres.

Do not miss this. It is worth every cent spent to purchase it, and every minute spent watching it.

5310519,5,B009AVCALC,"It's a shame that this marvelous mini series did not receive much publicity and was distributed through Encore, with its limited viewership.  Were it not for Roku and Netflix, I might never have known about this mini series.  While I did love James Cameron's Titanic, the movie, it pales in comparison to this mini series in almost every respect except for the superior special effects of the big budgeted movie, but special effects wizardry is no substitute for storyline and acting quality, both of which are superior in the mini series.

While the movie tells a one-dimensional, simple love story on board the ship, the mini series by virtue of its almost 10-hour length over 12 episodes deals with much more.  The mini series also has a love story behind it, but it has time to ""spread the love around"" literally among several characters instead of just two or three and, more importantly, it adds politics, religion, class, and engineering challenges to the mix.

All the action of the mini series happens while the ship is being built, in the shipyard, and in the streets and homes in the city of Belfast.  A page on Wikipedia lists the numerous historical inaccuracies in the mini series, some of which are quite severe, but none really detracted from the movie in retrospect.

Being largely ignorant of the history of Protestant/Catholic strife in Ireland, I learned a great deal about early 1900's Irish culture and the political and religious divide that separated the Protestants and the Catholics by watching this mini series.  It was an eye opener.

To American audiences there are a couple of instances where this European-created series was clearly making unnecessary and uncalled-for stereotypical slurs against us Americans by portraying some American characters as excessively ungraceful, uncouth, and loud, but this flaw aside it's still a great entertainment, which I highly recommend.",1379203200,,1905,5.080128205128205
5310520,5,B009AVCALC,"Good writing, good story, good acting. It was brilliant writing to insert a fictional character (Mark Muir) into the story to raise all the theories of what led to the demise of the Titanic. Also, hearing very probable life stories of some of the passengers powerfully personslizes the tragedy of the Titanic. I am sure some liberty was taken with strict historical accuracy regarding the historic personalities and sequence of events as is true for all of these types of films.

It is so timely today,as workers are being squeezed, and the very rights for which the union activists in Titanic fought and died for are being assaulted.  The series' cinematography, the acting, the plot and writing all put together rendered a very, almost immediately, rivetting experience.

5310612,5,B009AVCALC,Thid film showed exactly why Ireland has so many problrms.  What difference doees it make if you are protestant or Cattholic.  We are all members of the humsn race and if we can do a job and do it well what religion we are just doesn't matter.  Also loved seeing how Titanic was built...the intertwining stories werevery good also.  I really loved this film and have recommended it to lots of people.  The acting was excellent,1376697600,,426,4.552631578947368

5310637,4,B009AVCALC,I ENJOYED THIS SHOW.  I HAD TO RESEARCH TO SEE IF IT WAS ALL TRUE.  FICTION WITH A LOT OF TRUTH.  I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE A SEASON 2.  IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO ONE WEEKEND WATCH IT.,1376524800,,184,3.525
5310638,5,B009AVCALC,We all know the ship sank....  The story behind building it and the challenges added a 3rd Dimension to the story for me.

5310643,5,B009AVCALC,"Just really liked this, as a departure from the standard ""Titanic"" type films, this miniseries proves to be very dramatic, and attention getting series. The intertwining of personal lives, and dreams, makes it a favorite. For me, an American, it was a travel adventure, loved the accents, actors, stories, and dcor. Well done!",1376006400,,326,5.169811320754717

5310660,5,B009AVCALC,"Was looking for the responsible persons involved in the sinking of the Titanic. According to this movie Mr. Ismay is pretty much at fault for the sinking! Sad commentary on the attitude over the lifeboats!

5310663,5,B009AVCALC,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show.  There is a good mix of political/religious tension, romance, and character development.  My only worry is that there will not be a Season 2.  It reminds me of a good historical novel where the setting is accurately portrayed in history and you live through it with fictional characters.  Please make a season 2.",1375488000,,344,4.879310344827586

5310665,4,B009AVCALC,"I am a sucker for historical fiction dramas and have always been fascinated by the Titanic story.  I loved this series because it focused on a side that is not commonly told in movie remakes.  It was easy to identify with the characters and loved following the drama between the different classes and struggles of the workers for that time.  It was a little slow at certain times but for the most part, excellent!",1375142400,,413,4.554054054054054
5310676,5,B009AVCALC,"I almost skipped over this one thinking another SOAP. It is a little, but acting is tops, historical correctness for the most part.

5310677,5,B009AVCALC,"I happened upon this mini-series while surfing Amazon Prime and was drawn in immediately by the cinematography, immense settings, and period costumes. It made me want to know more about this time period in Ireland.

5310708,5,B009AVCALC,"It's a very well done series, I just wish it would continue! There are many factual errors, some I can't understand why. It would have been easy enough to do things the right way. The Hawke collision for instance. The damage is in the wrong place on the Olympic in the special effect. the only thing I can think of is that they got confused by the actual photos & didn't do their research. I can understand this, since I work in the industry, I know that deadlines can get in the way of spending time on things like research. On a positive note, I loved the script, I loved the characters for the most part. Thomas Andrews started out totally the opposite from what I've read he was like but then changed into the man I have read about. I really liked the story between Sofia & Marc, although... (SPOILER) I'm not happy that there isn't another series that follows them where it left off. I tried watching the other Miniseries produced in 2012 that was 4 episodes & I couldn't get past episode 1. low budget, Poorly written in my opinion & characters I could care less about, but on a positive note, the FX seemed well made (episode 1 at least). Watch Blood & Steel if you have to choose between them.",1374451200,,1201,4.342222222222222

5310728,5,B009AVCALC,I can't wait for season 2 to come out.  This show is just as addicting and Downton Abbey!!!  My husband and I love it.  Not only does it show a realistic view of the way that jobs and money polarized Catholics and Protestants it gives accurate historic information on how the ship was built and they problems that they faced.  My husband is an engineer and he loves it for the engineer portion I am a historian and I love it for historical portion and the love stories that come out of it.,1373587200,,489,4.225806451612903

5310746,4,B009AVCALC,Most stories regarding Titannic focus on its end (the sinking). This is a refreshing look at its beginning and all those involved.

We watched the entire series in about a week, reflecting the fact that 1) we are parents of small children with little life outside of streaming movies, and 2) this series provided a wonderful historical fiction fantasy get away.  I do wish the ship had been more of a character, but there was a great deal of historical context provided about Belfast in the days during the ship's construction.  The series looked and felt very similar to Downton Abbey, although with slightly less melodrama.  And, watching one very much helps add context to one's understanding of the political times in the other.  All in all, a great series.  I wish there could be more, but with a subject like Titanic, I guess one goes in knowing how it's all going to end.",1372636800,,795,4.563380281690141

However, after watching a few episdoes did some research and we found that there are many (according to Wikipedia) ""historical inaccuracies, some of them so fundamental that if they were corrected, it would completely alter the series"". Not sure why some of the facts were so altered but we wish that were not the case; especially relating to the Irish labor unrest, and the portrayal of Thomas Andrews, who in reality was a well-loved individual both in the yard of workers and management, as well as by the passengers on the ship.

5310774,5,B009AVCALC,"Most people know the story of the Titanic's sinking, the ""unsinkable"" ship hits an iceberg and sinks with massive loss of life. What most people don't know is that there was a story behind the construction of the Titanic, in her time this ship was the equivalent of a moon shot, highly technical, loads of new technology and new methods of ship building, many design compromises made and lessons learned during construction. Then there was the labor movement, a Home Rule vote as Northern Ireland tried to resolve Protestant vs Catholic issues, the Women's Suffrage movement, they could have easily doubled the number of episodes and still not have covered the entire story. This series focused on a young engineer who proposed a number of ""fixes"" to the design problems encountered, he was constantly over-ruled but in each instance he was proven correct even though he was relegated to basically saying ""I told you so"" after each calamity. This is an engaging, ""can't stop watching"" series that you will want to see over and over again, I only wish that it had been longer. Highly recommended.",1371168000,,1095,4.89247311827957

I noticed several character misrepresentations and scientific inaccuracies.  The engineers, dock workers, and capitalists were all portrayed in mean stereo types, not including the collaboration, hard work, pride, and occasional conflict that really happens in a huge project.  Seeing the engineer portrayed as being ignored when issues are brought up is an insulting and inaccurate portrayal of engineering and business today and in the past.

5310792,4,B009AVCALC,"I was really taken by the first eposide because it combines many aspects of great enterprise - creating a new mode of sea travel during a time when entrepreneurs could do something and people generally could adapt to what had to be done. You have business, engineering and science, politics, sectarian conflict, and whatever comes in future eposides. Great visuals and music add to its entertainment value, as do fine acting and wonderful costumes.",1370736000,,448,5.0675675675675675
5310793,5,B009AVCALC,"Just finished watching this show last night and was very sad to see it end.
I thought the show was better than Downton Abbey.
The characters are very real, the acting superb and the visuals were so nice.

Hats off to Kevin Zegers and Billy Carter.

Hopefully a follow up will follow.

5 stars for sure",1370736000,,301,4.339285714285714

5310795,4,B009AVCALC,"A very impressive lead up to my favorite movie of all time.  I was disappointed by the speed of the series, looking forward to a long lead up but it went way too quickly.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Titanic.",1370649600,,215,4.095238095238095
5310806,5,B009AVCALC,"I am only a couple of episodes into this series, but so far I love it.  It reminds me of Downton Abbey in the way that it's a great period piece that shows the division among classes with superb acting.  Would highly recommend it!",1370649600,,230,4.204545454545454
5310807,4,B009AVCALC,Have recommended this show. I really enjoyed every episode. Very realistic and interesting. I was surprised. At all the issues people were faced with in this time period.,1370649600,,170,5.107142857142857
5310808,5,B009AVCALC,love it for its interesting plots and history. i wish they had a second and thrid season. they could continue with what the surviors went thru afterwards and or the olimpic and gigaintic,1370649600,,186,4.666666666666667
5310809,4,B009AVCALC,"I enjoyed watching blood and steel and liked the actors in it (except Chris Noth just didn't seem to fit) though it was terribly predictable and seemed a bit slow at times. But after I was done and looked it up online, I found out that much of the history was very inaccurate. So don't confuse anything about this movie with the truth about the building of the Titanic, its materials, the Olympus or the labor disputes surrounding it. It's just a story, not a documentary.",1370649600,,472,4.5
5310810,5,B009AVCALC,Very interesting and beautiful! The Titanic was a beautiful vessel it was so interesting to see how she was built and how much trouble it was to build her.,1370649600,,155,4.379310344827586
5310811,5,B009AVCALC,"I have seen plenty of movies and documentaries describing the actual sinking of the Titanic but this stood out because it details the social milieu in which Titanic was built. Quite an educational experience! I was vaguely aware of the British rule in Ireland but didn't know how deep the Catholic/Protestant divide was/is, about the poverty and misery in Belfast, about the famed 'Divide and Rule', about the labor/union struggles, about Irish nationalism, about an empire's arrogance,  about the dangers of a shipyard, about the German connection leading to the First World War. All these are beautifully and tightly woven around about a dozen characters who seem real with their zeal, love, violence, anger, passions, and personal/national goals.
While I have watched the entire series just a couple of days ago I will come back to watch them again and again after some months/years.",1370476800,,886,5.152777777777778

5310814,4,B009AVCALC,Weaving several dramas into one with the ship as the main character is a fantastic way to tell this incredible story.,1370390400,,117,4.619047619047619
5310815,4,B009AVCALC,I love this show! It is so well cast and the plots are really interesting with good character development. It's great to see what went on during the building of the Titanic especially since we know the outcome. Highly recommended and I look forward to a Season 2.,1370390400,,263,4.5
5310826,3,B009AVCALC,"With the anniversary of the Titanic's sinking, this show explores how the ship was made, not the final outcome. While fictionalized, several of the characters included were real. The love stories are tiresome and there is an almost closing to the main character's storyline.

5310831,4,B009AVCALC,"It was more interesting that I expected.  I wasn't  happy about the storyline regarding Dr. Muir and Sarah.
The cliffhanger wrap up was good.  It left it to the viewer as to who did and did not survive.  I would watch another season.",1369785600,,233,4.348837209302325

5310833,5,B009AVCALC,"Many movies have been made about the maiden, and only, voyage of the Titanic, but very few go into the actual building of the ship. This series, set in early 20th century Ireland, identifies the struggles between the Irish shipbuilders and the big money financing the White Star Line's operation.  It clearly shows the division between the ship builders and big money financing the building of the ship; Irish Protestants and Catholics; and labor and management.  The story follows a metallurgist hired by J. P. Morgan to insure the proper chemical makeup of the steel being used in the ship and his relationships with the people he associates with--right up to the sailing of the Titanic.  It was quite an interesting perspective on a subject not well covered in the past.  I could hardly wait to see each episode.  The series was well done, but the video of one episode was very fuzzy, not nearly as clear as all the others.  Other than that one ""fuzzy"" episode, the series was well worth watching.",1369785600,,1000,4.7514450867052025

5310835,3,B009AVCALC,"I enjoyed watching this series. However, I was disappointed when I learned that so much of the details of the building of the ship and the political stife during this time were not based on facts. Wish they had stuck to history rather than trying to rewrite it.",1369785600,,261,4.458333333333333
5310846,5,B009AVCALC,Disappointed to find there would not be a second season.  Great story and characters.  Can't imagine what they went through when the (unsinkable) Titanic did sink.,1369785600,,163,5.230769230769231
5310847,5,B009AVCALC,This is the story of the beginnings of Titanic and its building along with the political unrest in Belfast during that time period.  The acting was wonderful and this viewer got drawn in very quickly!,1369785600,,200,4.714285714285714
5310848,3,B009AVCALC,a bit on the boring side. perhaps i didn't watch enough of the series to come fo a full and completed decision,1369785600,,110,4.045454545454546
5310849,5,B009AVCALC,"Love this time period, I think this show gives a very different take about the people who built the Titanic as opposed to the love story.
The perspective is much more engaging and brings the characters a increased role in appearance. The telling of what was happening behind the scenes. The politics involved, peoples lives versus money saved.",1369785600,,343,4.931034482758621
5310850,5,B009AVCALC,"I initially thought I would only see a story about how the Titanic was built, but am getting so much more out of it.  The story  about the people is great and so are the history lessons.  I enjoy the information about the labor and ship building technique issues and the religious/class turmoil going on in Ireland in the early 1920s.",1369699200,,334,4.442622950819672
5310851,5,B009AVCALC,"This was excellent.  I didn't want it to end.  While, of course we know the outcome, I really wanted more.  I actually didn't want to watch the last episode because I knew it would be over.  The mix of history and the story line was so well done I was pulled in.  On top of which I learned so much.  A must see for everyone! Bravo!!!",1369699200,,333,3.9696969696969697
5310852,5,B009AVCALC,"I just finished watching TITANIC: BLOOD & STEEL on NETFLIX. This is a beautifully made series with interesting characters. I really enjoyed watching it. Each installment kept me hooked. The series is an interesting back story of the ship being built and events that took place at the time. Alessandra Mastronardi is incredibly cute and strikingly beautiful. Her picture should definitely be on the cover of this blu-ray release. I would like to see a continuation of this series from when the ship leaves port and what happens to all the characters. I don't like having to make up my own ending on something like this. Please Tandem Communications, Lions Gate, how about a continuation of the story?",1369526400,,699,4.932203389830509

It was fun to watch and when I finished one episode, I could not wait to start the next episode. I don't know how factual it was but still was entertaining.",1369526400,,258,3.8867924528301887
5310854,3,B009AVCALC,Like the story but its lacking a really edgy character. Plus you know the outcome.  It's interesting to know the back story and I will continue to watch it,1369440000,,155,4.344827586206897

5310867,3,B009AVCALC,"Not a whole lot could be done telling a story regarding ""action"" prior to when the Titanic sets sail other than labor strikes. This series focuses on the ""have"" and ""have-nots"" well but could use a dose of more drama other than slow drama with just a handful of characters.
 No cliff hangers at the end of each episode here because of the apathy in the acting.
Not bad if you're into nostalgic history, just don't expect excitement for the majority of the series.",1369440000,,463,4.511904761904762
5310868,5,B009AVCALC,"I wish this story would go on after the Titanic has the disastrous voyage. The series does go thru the construction of the ship but there are personal stories of the people who are involved in the making. Also as it is built the troubles arising over its construction,the steel, the bulkhead, etc. tell the story of why the ship met its destiny.
I really likes this series!",1369440000,,373,4.5
5310869,4,B009AVCALC,"Even thou not perfectly accurate in some historical details, I think it gives a very good feel of that time & reflects well what was the time, place & what kind of people were surrounding the Titanic in the beginning of the 20th century.",1369180800,,237,4.409090909090909
5310870,4,B009AVCALC,"While it is no ""Downton Abbey"", and it moves a bit slow, the story is engrossing. Outstanding solid acting make it stand on its own two legs. This is by no means a 'Kate & Leo' sinking of the doomed Titanic. This is truly about the hard working and sometimes desperate working class, clashing with the wealthy. It is also an illumination to the dreadful, never ending religious clash between Catholics and Protestant.
It is hard to watch just one episode at a time, as things really get going by episode four.",1369180800,,509,4.543478260869565

5310874,4,B009AVCALC,"I really liked Season 1, hoping there is a Season 2 in the works.  I gave it a 4 because the story tended to drag a bit, but overall I enjoyed it.",1368748800,,146,3.5625

5310887,1,B009AVCALC,"Fun to watch - decent historical content.. but what the heck?

... no season 2?

You gotta be kiddin' me !!!

This just kills me! You invest all this time getting into the story and then of course season 1 ends with tons of unresolved drama, and now these nincompoops aren't gonna do season 2!

Would have been 5 stars if Mr. Producer would have finished the story off.
Because of the rediculous NON ending you get 1 star.

And you know where Mr. Producers can put that star right?",1368403200,5,481,4.3
5310888,4,B009AVCALC,"I loved seeing the making of the RMS Titanic.  I never knew that the religious divide was so strong in Ireland back when the Titanic was made.  But I think the religious divide, to me at least, seamed to be  people from England Protestant controlling the native population of Ireland Catholic.  At times  I thought that they dwelled too much on the personal life stories and I wish they focused more on the actual building of the ship.  For example I would have liked to have seen more of the arguments between the engineer and the board of directors who sacrificed safety and quality for profits.  The TV show it's self is of very high quality with excellent filming and lighting.  The actors and story line were also very good.  Like I said I was greedy and just wanted more of the Titanic",1368144000,,791,4.475524475524476
5310889,5,B009AVCALC,This is worth watching just to see what may have happened during the building of the mighty ship.  Long but worth it.,1367625600,,117,4.318181818181818
5310890,5,B009AVCALC,"The Series is wonderful for depicting the time and struggles of the erea, however the story is mildly dull.  Dr. Muir the ships matalagist finds love in a working class local women whom he never backs, she struggles in the fight for equality amoungst the Catholics and the Protostents but he takes the back seat on the whole manor.  But on a much positive note the series does a great job in showing the buisness side of Titanics birth, never before have I ever seen a movie or documentary for that mater that shows her birth.

On a true negative note, one will get really involved in the show and at the end almost everyone is boarding the Titanic to include Dr. Muir and Ms. Sophia. It leaves you with many un answered questions.  What happens to them? Perhaps we will never know.",1367625600,,782,4.4475524475524475

The people in the film portray fictional characters and real people that were involved with building of the Titanic. It was not ment as a documentary . The producers got a few things wrong as far as the actual history, but that did not matter to me. I liked the movie and have watched it several times.",1367452800,,423,4.2875

5310907,3,B009AVCALC,"Could have been better, but like most historic dramas, it's too dramatic, and not overly historic. For educational purposes I guess filmmakers feel the need to telescope history, compressing details into their story; here, the need was to create Edwardian society, and to give the viewer an idea of the social issues of the day. While these may be valid, they aren't very accurately portrayed in the series. A few reviewers have already commented on the inaccuracies in the series. I'll only add that Coco Chanel wasn't designing clothing like the women wear in this show for at least 10 more years. The fact that working class Irish women are wearing lapelled jackets, corset-less skirts, and driving attire from the 20's borders on ludicrousness. But I liked the series well enough. Don't watch it for any detailed accuracy however. The gaffs glare pretty obviously.",1366243200,,868,5.034722222222222

I thought each character played their part perfectly and it was so interesting to see the building of Titanic and the struggles of the men who were involved in the incredible endeavor of building that beautiful ship!!!

I was so happy to see it available to order so quickly so I can watch it when I want.  The item arrived in perfect condition and before expected (as usual).",1366243200,,616,4.5636363636363635
5310909,5,B009AVCALC,"WOW. What a great dramatization of the 3-yr story of Titanic being built. It's historical, although providing plenty of fact changes to enhance the drama. In total, it is the people, city, politics, science, religion, and companies involved in building the first of its kind, unknowing it would sink on its maiden voyage.

It is a magnificent, cleverly written drama prequel to the Titanic disaster. It incorporates modern knowledge gleaned from the submerged ship structure. Like Downton Abbey--relationships between Titanic's management lead by Lord Pirrie (Derek Jacobe- Cadfael) and the shipbuilding workers are remarkable. Even romantic moments appear to soften the atmosphere of ship steel. The music is hauntingly beautiful. 1909-12 period set/costume perfection (in and outside) shows richest elegance to the pit of Belfast slums. The musical magical Irish brogue of the times is as compelling as the writing.
It's hard to single out cast members; the acting is generally exceptionally well done.

Episode 1 A City Divided  1909 NYC, JP Morgan (Chris Noth) celebrates the ship to be built. RMS Titanic. On to Belfast where young Dr. Muir (Kevin Zegers), metallurgist, throws himself into the project.

2 Stained Steel Union lockout & unrest escalates. Muir discovers impurities in the steel used. A romance crashes.

4 Danger Looms  Workers turn on one another. Pirrie & Sir Carlton (Ian McElhinney) conflict. Muir has some successes.

5 Under Lock and Key Muir's past is revealed as are the consequences. His contingent mystery avoids discovery. Titanic's schedule is paramount.

6 The Imposter A strike creates tension on many fronts. People make personal choices based on their own needs. Titanic's progress is more chaotic than ever.

7 The Truth Shall Set You Free  Muir no longer employed with Titanic project but concentrates on locating a particular adopted child. JP Morgan reinstates Muir & orders Titanic building full speed ahead.

8 High Stakes Political stakes ramp up on multiple fronts. Romances rise and fall. Violence escalates. 1910 election results are...

11 The Tipping Point A new accountant sent by Morgan treads on Belfast toes. Clues to the lost child emerge during growing Home Rule division between religious sides.

11 The Tipping Point A new accountant sent by Morgan treads on Belfast toes. Clues to the lost child emerge during growing Home Rule division between religious sides.

12 The 'Unsinkable' Sets Sail Titanic is about to sail for NYC and several Belfast folk decide to ride to new hope, a new life, in America.

With such a long series, the bonus is minimal. Making of...8 min. and Visual Effects of...4 min. Still, it's a top 2012 historical drama production.

5310915,4,B009AVCALC,"I have read previous reviews on this series and in some I agree, in others I do not. I think there is a lot of new information on the story before Titanic sank, and this is a dynamic view. I think there were some historically inaccurate parts, but they are used well in the story. Sometimes there needs to be inaccuracy to move a story along otherwise it becomes slow moving and like a dry documentary. I enjoyed the story overall and while it was focused on Titanic, you get better feel for the people behind her.",1364083200,,514,4.309278350515464
5310926,5,B009AVCALC,"Having read many of the posted reviews, it is safe to say one's opinion of the series depends on how it affected them in heart!
I wasn't personally expecting a documentary, but an entertaining story around the building of the famous ship! And the producers didn't fail in my perspective. I have watched the 12 hour series from start to finish on three ocassions. At the end it left me wanting more everytime I watched it! One feels empty, knowing the fate of the ship, as to who among the cast survives etc. In that respect, I would welcome a sequel, using the same cast, to fulfill the questions left!

Are there things about the story I would change if I could? Sure! But overall, this was one of the best mini-series I have ever watched. Splendid acting by an excellent cast on a monumental screenplay! On top of that, a gorgeous musical soundtrack!
In my opinion, a very entertaining series!",1363910400,,895,4.559006211180124

5310931,4,B009AVCALC,"I found this to be an extremely interesting mini series.  It is ""Titanic"" from a different point of view - the struggle between labor and management to build the most advanced ship of its time.  Prominant is the issue of Ireland's long-fought battle for Home Rule.  I do not have any problem with errors such as at which site the ship was being built.  I view this only as poetic license.  After all, this is not a documentary.  The story lines were well written and acted.  My problem lies with the fact that I was drawn into the story and cared about the future of the various characters. After I realized which characters boarded the ship, I was left hanging as to their fate.  Regardless, I would not wish to deter anyone from watching this series.  The offer to purchase separate episodes version refers to this series as ""Season One.""  I certainly hope this is the case as the story begs for more.",1361318400,,903,4.484662576687117

During this tale, he becomes involved with local residents.  The cultural context is based on truth.

5310937,5,B009AVCALC,"For starters, this is the best movie about the labor movement since ""The Grapes of Wrath."" It's multi-dimensional, dealing w class issues, the history of Ireland, the threat of ambition outpacing technology - all seen through the eyes of young Dr. Mark Muir, a quality engineer who discovers the technological roots that we have recently learned caused Titanic's sinking. Though fictionalized, many characters are based on historical figures, beginning w banker JP Morgan who financed Titanic.

The characters are well-drawn & beautifully acted. The editing is excellent, the special effects amazing & the costumes gorgeous (including those of the workers).  As for the plot, there are few villains here - just the push & pull of all the interests we see at work today: social, technical, economic, & human.

5310939,5,B009AVCALC,"OK, so the damage done to Olympic in her collision with the Hawke was shown at the bow and not the stern, and the yet-unfinished hull of Titanic was somehow moved into Olympic's recently vacated slip under the gantry, but if you can forgive these kind of major gaffes and focus on what was done well, this series is quite enjoyable. Certainly the social and political tone of Edwardian Belfast was captured effectively, and the viewer is drawn into the story by well-defined characters and good acting. Nice not to have to watch yet another recreation of the disaster for a change.",1359676800,3,581,4.705882352941177

5310942,4,B009AVCALC,I purchased this DVD based on a friend's suggestion - it is a good movie showing historical data that I haven't seen before.

5310943,5,B009AVCALC,"All the actresses and actors performed well beyond what I had expected.
I have to take issue with one comment in regard to the idea
that Neve Campbell who plays the reporter, should not require another
subplot involving her, for later in the movie.  Everyone that knows
about movies in general, understands that there needs to be an ending
that would let us know what happens to all the main characters.  Without
that, someone focusing on a certain character will feel unrewarded.
Plus the Neve Campbell character gives us knowledge of the coming Great War
of World War 1, along with the issues of women equality and worker union protests,
along with ethnic and religious divisions, all causing problems during this time.
All of this happening while Titanic was being built.  So it gives us more of
a feeling of the era and what was happening.  A brief mention of World War 1 was
a smart idea and it was mentioned briefly rather than throughout the movie, which
I think was correct.  People watching the movie might think during this time that
an upcoming war in Europe was about to happen.  This makes it clear that it was still
not an important enough topic or was maybe even unexpected.  The local issues were
the main topics instead.  In fact we are aware of the upcoming war through the
reporter, Neve Campbell when the spy mentions it to her (you need to watch to see what
I mean and why a spy suddenly appears).
There is another reason that Neve Campbell is given attention at the end.  As I've said,
in most movies you need a story arc from beginning to end.  She fits this perfectly as
we see her in the beginning, then throughout the movie, and finally performing something
unexpected near the end.
If there is a continuation of the series, she may also be doing something unexpected where
we find out more about each person.  She might even find out about the dangers of the ship, what was
going to happen, etc.  I mean a reporter could be very useful in a movie like this.  She already
has throughout this movie.
Also, the reporter in Neve Campbell I thought was played very well all throughout the movie.  I enjoyed
seeing her enough and respond to different situations, that her character gradually became more important each time
she came up.  She was not the main character but that does not mean she was not an integral or interesting character in the movie.
One final thought about Neve Campbell is that they had to find a reason for why she had to be on Titanic along with the other characters who embarked upon the ship, although at different times and entrances.  One for the poor and the other for the well to do.
Anyway, that is my opinion.
There is one actress that really stood out in this movie.  She is an incredible actress.  Her name is Ophelia Lovibond.  I'm not sure what the exact name of her status in society would be.  She is the daughter of a wealthy family and who hates all the boring things and demands that go with it.  Her family represents the older way of thinking which was quickly becoming extinct.  Although you might still see it now in little ways, if you think about it.  Her acting abilities and facial expressions really blew me away.  I think we should all expect great things from this particular actress.
I recommend getting the dvd.  It is rare that you will find such a great series made for television.  I don't think I have ever purchased a series for television before but this is worth it.",1359072000,,3449,4.52258064516129

5310956,3,B009AVCALC,"I believe this story/video could have been recorded on two disks rather than three. Every installment had a long pre-amble and a few minutes of credits at the end. Whoever put this series on disk should be condemned to watch it over and over again.

So, seeing that there are twelve episodes - there is eleven times the extraneous material that you must endure to get to the story - RIDICULOUS!

The attention to detail on the sets was terrific. the story was great, even though the leading man (Kevin Zegers), had a proclivity of jumping into bed with different women - then saying he was sorry.

Genuine Belfast accents and shooting locations.

In fact, the Titanic itself was sort of a sub-story, with the trials and joys of the various individuals taking center stage.",1356307200,2,411,4.680555555555555
5310982,4,B009AVCALC,"Titanic:  Blood and Steel will probably be eclipsed by more conventional Titanic movies that focus on the disaster.  It's really a very intelligent drama, focusing not so much on the sheer process of ship building as on labor negotiations, class tensions, religious discrimination, feminism, idealism, and politics. (Where else will you find heartwarming slogans like ""We're going to take engineering back from the accountants!"") The characters often debate politics, ethics, and engineering; you may or may not like this sort of thing; I did. The vocabulary is refreshingly sophisticated. The series shows what is apparently a real ship being built in a real shipyard, with lots of gritty industrial shots. Belfast is convincingly cobblestoned and dirty (I was reminded of Pittsburgh, in its steel and coal days).

I was, therefore, disappointed by the lack of realism in other areas. Criticisms in Wikipedia include things like the purported Titanic being built on the slip where in reality the Olympic was built. Most viewers won't know that or care. But most *will* know that the Titanic was not bigger than its sister ship the Olympic, that the ""unsinkable"" marketing slogan was not generated by an engineer (who would have had more sense), and some other blatant errors. Even more important, for a movie that focuses on social change, this one is appallingly ignorant of early 20th-century society.  Women did not commonly have sex before marriage and whether they did or not, their goal was marriage and they did their best to guide the man towards it, not have an endless on-off relationship like several in this movie. Tycoons did not disinherit an only child/daughter who refused to marry the supremely stupid son of a wealthy man. (Why would anyone want a stupid son-in-law to inherit and manage his vast, complicated, multimillion business empire? And another wealthy groom could always be found.) People did not constantly say ""huh"" and ""yeah"" and ""have a nice day."" And my pet peeve--why are movies now referring to the ship as ""Titanic,"" as if it were a person, instead of ""the Titanic""?

Plotwise, this is not exactly a soap opera. It's not divided into story segments that fit neatly into episodes. The drama goes on as if this were a twelve-hour movie (which is how I watched the DVD, on six successive evenings). Most stories drag a bit while the numerous major characters waffle about important life decisions--this series would have worked better as ten episodes. In the last two, the characters finally make up their minds and definitively plan their futures. The movie makers definitely rose in my estimation here, because for most characters this means sailing on the Titanic, whether in first class or third class. They're seen off with tearful hugs, but everyone is full of optimism for a brighter future.

And that's it. You don't see the ship sink, and there's no text epilog.  Aside from one or two real historical characters, you'll never know who was and was not saved.",1356220800,33,3000,5.0120481927710845

Others have listed the many many historical inaccuracies, so I won't go there.  Suffice it to say that this is a tedious soap opera with the building of the Titanic in the background.  All the subject matters handled in the series could have been extremely interesting.  Instead, most of it is told through awful dialogue, plodding & clunky story telling.  I would have even endured the soap opera aspects if they had been minimal and they got the history right.  But no... Once again the Titanic and its history gets the shaft in favor of bloated directorial and writer's egos.

5310986,5,B009AVCALC,"Titanic: Blood and Steel is a riveting fictional drama. Of course it's not history. who cares? James Cameron's movie Titanic was fiction too. A rich girl from first class falls in love with a boy from steerage? The boy tells us he grew up ice fishing in Michigan and knows that one would die of hypothermia within minutes yet fails to pull his torso up on the board his sweetheart is resting on. He is lucid enough to crack a joke about sending a stern letter of complaint to the White Star line, so he had to know he was in mortal danger. The first half of the movie is charming historical fiction. The second half is a typical Hollywood action flick with gratuitous action, gratuitous because the story ends exactly the same as it would have if the girl got on the life raft with the girl surviving and the boy dying. The action scenes are not believable. They are supposed to running through compartments flooded with frigid water but their breathe is not steamy, they have no goose bumps, they are not shivering. It is totally obvious that they are in the warm waters off the coast of Baja California. Then the girl runs away from her rich fiance and family to travel the world as a single, unchaperoned woman of no means in 1911? How did she support herself? Respectable hotels did rent rooms to young, unchaperoned women in 1911. She saves a valuable sapphire necklace for sentimental reasons. But her sweetheart did not give it to her. Her cruel fiance who abused her gave it to her. Why did she not sell it to finance her world tour? And this piece of Hollywood junk won an Academy Award.
  Titanic: Blood and Steel was never intended to be a documentary. It is fiction and I loved. It is a soap opera, a very good one. I found the story compelling, the production values high, the acting excellent. Some parts are historical true. Discrimination against Irish Catholic workers is a fact and persisted in Northern Ireland into the late twentieth century. The sinking of the Titanic showed the world the gross injustice of the class system--none of the survivors were from steerage. The belief that the industrial revolution would trickle down and benefit the masses was shattered.",1355184000,4,2188,4.622107969151671

5311009,1,B009AVCALC,"I'm a Titanic junkie.  I've been interested in the ship since the fourth grade when I read my first book about it.  In high school Walter Lord meticulously detailed book A Night To Remember was a constant companion of mine.  Of course James Cameron's 1997 masterpiece was and remains one of my all time favorite movies.  This past April 15 marked the 100th anniversary of the tragic night the ship sank and took 1500 souls with it  and this year two mini-series debuted on tv.  A 4-part series Titanic dealt with a soap opera set up much like the Clifton Webb/ Barbara Stanwyck version did.  And T: Blood and Steel aired later and was a 12-part series.  As it turned out, even with all of its sappy, soapy moments, the shorter of the two is the better.

  While T:B&S dealt mainly with the building of the ship, they do it in such a dull manner.  The characters are flat and seem to have no real reason to be doing what they are doing nor do the actors appear to even care about the story they are trying to tell.  And worse yet, you don't even get to see the ship sink.  I get that, by now, we all know what happened on the early morning hours of April 15, 1912 but when you see people you spent the last 12 weeks with board the ship, you want to at least learn their fates.  I don't know if the creators of the show was hoping to get another season or if this was a creative idea to leave the audience guessing but, in the end, we are left with a rather sour note in our throats.

5311010,1,B009AVCALC,"As a maritime and Titanic author and historian, I was quite interested to see this production, as it focused on the construction of the legendary liner and came at things from a unique perspective. Unfortunately, I am beyond disappointed (appalled would be a more apt word) by the historical errors that made their way into the miniseries.

I have been working my way through the 12-part miniseries, trying desperately not to shred the arms of my chair or grinding my teeth to powder in so doing. Although the production might be an enjoyable piece if it were purely fictional, the history of the Titanic became a tragic, jumbled mess in this production.

In some respects I found that it captured the period. However even there the effect was not complete; for example, the ""jazz"" music in the early-episode society scenes was about 10-15 years too premature, and that's something that anyone could get right.

Was it poor research that caused this historical monstrosity? Apparently not. Why? Because of how many little details they apparently had easy access to and saw fit to include in the production (i.e., the number of passengers on Olympic's crossing where she tangled with the Hawke, the design of the Great Gantry, the fact that the riveters were paid by the rivet, the way the rivet seals were tested, the name of the British Board of Trade inspector, etc.). Meanwhile, the production included an overwhelming number of serious historical errors, many of which were easier to ""get right"" than the aforementioned factoids.

Included in this list of grievous technical and historical mistakes are:

* The ""fact"" that J. P. Morgan bankrolled and exercised great influence in the design and construction of the vessels. White Star paid for the vessels, and Ismay and White Star, rather than Morgan directly, had primary influence in the design and construction;
* The steel issues, which is an older theory which has really been addressed and is blown entirely out of proportion in this production;
* The blueprints for the Titanic shown from the opening credits through every episode, and which are actually, in every instance I noticed, of the Lusitania;
* The slip that the Titanic was built on in the show is actually Olympic's slip;
* The ""fact"" that the Olympic/Hawke collision (September 20, 1911) took place long before the launch of the Titanic (May 31, 1911) (???!!!);
* The term ""unsinkable"" (or ""practically unsinkable"") is dreamed up and applied primarily to Titanic by the fictional character after the collision with the Hawke, when in reality it was introduced by White Star publicity and period Trade journals such as The Shipbuilder during construction of the two liners, and was applied to both equally. (Coincidentally, the special number of The Shipbuilder in which the term appeared is seen in the series long before Muir supposedly dreamed up the term);
* The damage to the Olympic appears on the forward-port quarter of the hull, rather than the aft-starboard quarter;
* Ismay saying that the Titanic would be 'much larger' than the Olympic;
* Ismay didn't even have a speaking part, I don't believe, until the third episode;
* The timing of any discussion regarding the possibilities of a double hull would have been back around 1907-1908 and applied to both ships, and would not have been applied solely to Titanic after the collision between the Olympic and the Hawke (in the end, a double-bottom was adopted for each);
* The complete out-of-character, irritated, gruff behavior of Thomas Andrews throughout much of the first half of the series;
* The worries within the yard that Titanic was just ""too big"" (the Germans were already starting work on the Imperator, which was still larger);
* BOT Inspector Francis Carruthers was on site virtually every day of construction, yet he is not seen - until what, the fifth episode? - when he is lethargically tapping a couple of rivets. The implication is that Carruthers and the BOT exercised no real authority or oversight during construction, when in reality the original documentation and correspondence shows that they did not always see 'eye-to-eye' and had to work together to reach satisfactory results for both;
* The concept that Harland & Wolff paid an unusually small amount of money to laborers (for the period, mind you) or were extraordinarily ungenerous in paying out benefits to families of those who were injured or killed in their yard (again, for the period). The record of payout benefits given to injured workers or to the families of those killed during construction of the two ships is still available and is actually quite high for the period.

The list of egregious historical blunders just goes on and on. They are quite shocking in this series, especially since someone involved with the production/screenplay writing so clearly had access to little factoids that they saw fit to include. It was so badly done that I began to see in the fictional Muir character shades of the German Second Officer from the Nazi propaganda film, where he was the sole voice of reason warning everyone that the ship was doomed.

If one even bothers to watch this miniseries, don't take anything in it as fact unless it is checked against leading research on the subject. In my view, this was a completely missed opportunity.",1351987200,22,5314,4.964044943820225
5311011,5,B009AVCALC,"My heart (and soul) has always been drawn to the people of Titanic...from the first time I saw a camera scan over the debris field and seeing the untouched boot in the mud, to the certain doom ""Jack"" (or anyone) must have felt knowing there was no option but to die, the unbelievable (accepted) ignorance of the better half(?)as well as the shipping regulations. This was the second largest ship created to date, did the regulators learn nothing from Olympic and see the need to make, at least, minimal changes to their regulations?

Kudos to James Cameron for showing us another theory for how the ship broke apart, but I agree the English movie version of the sinking is more believable than Rose being the only one able to get her fat ass on a huge wooden headboard back in a time when carpenters made quality wood products without fillers.

Obviously there are items in this series that deserved better explanations and perhaps more of a presence from an actor or two, but it did put forth more details to which one can research on their own if they prefer to do so.

At first, I thought this series would be another re-hashing of the sinking we have seen over and over, but I must say I was glad to be disappointed.  It drew me in on a more personal level, made me see the struggles, stigmas and social separations of a people continually in a state of hope and who wanted change and who wanted better and fair futures.  To be so full of hope in a land so oppressed and ""see"" and ""feel"" what going to a new (and new) country would mean for and to these people, through their eyes.....and then to know the outcome. I can now see how steerage was a step up for these people from where they came from and from what they had endured, something James Cameron only succeeded in referring to as unthinkably disgusting to the people in first class.  What was that line, ""Do you want to see me reduced to a seamstress?""  Bill Mackie seems to have done pretty well for himself. All in how you look at it I guess. I so wanted to yell at them to go to London instead!  Everything seemed to move them towards the Titanic though.  No matter what direction any of their lives were moving towards or going in, it ended up re-aquainting them with each other, drawing them to the Titanic and its fate. The shear numbers of fathers, sons, wives, mothers, daughters and families, hopes and dreams, all gone in an instant.",1351296000,3,2406,4.425339366515837
5311012,3,B009AVCALC,"I found this miniseries while flicking through the channels and taped all twelve installments.  We enjoyed the first 8 episodes but then the last 4 seemed to drag on with the last episode ending as the Titanic left port.  I realize that we all know the fate of the ship, however, there were some survivors - so, it is up to the viewer to make our own assumptions about the main characters aboard.  Did any survive? Did Mark realize that the daughter he had been searching for throughout most of the series was on board?  Too many loose ends ruined a good series. I was left feeling cheated.",1350777600,6,590,4.435185185185185
5311013,3,B009AVCALC,"I watched this series on Encore, and quite enjoyed the first half of the series. Unfortunately, with few exceptions the major characters are not developed further after the first few episodes, and do not display any significant growth or change thereafter. There is only enough plot to carry this through six to eight episodes, so the last three episodes in particular feel like an overlong buildup to an anticlimactic end. The series is also choppily edited, and the writing is very predictable. You can tell exactly when each scene is going to be cut just before it gets there.",1350604800,2,579,4.858585858585859
5311014,2,B009AVCALC,"The title of my review should perhaps have been, ""James Cameron, where are you?""  By his own admission, he spent over 6 months editing his epic film, ""Titanic,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett.  Cameron's editing brought the blockbuster down to 3 hours and 14 minutes.  The miniseries, ""Titanic: Blood & Steel,"" needs a similar downsizing.

Although concessions have to be made for a miniseries vs. a feature film, as to length and character development, that excuse doesn't really hold up.  Perhaps the most telling thing here is that neither my wife nor myself cared for what happened to the lead characters when the miniseries ended.  Derek Jacobi and Billy Carter did good work, but the other actors and overall story came up short.  We were just glad that the piece was over and that the film's arguing, fighting, and disconnected plot lines had stopped.

There were a few features of this miniseries that might be helpful in a historical sense.  One was the aspect of getting the people in Belfast to stop bickering and shooting each other in order to finally build a ship.  Another might be the inferior nature of the steel used in the early-1900's which was surely a factor in Titanic's demise.  Finally, the special effects in showing ship construction and launch were first rate.  Too bad the accompanying drama didn't keep pace.

Beyond these elements, the endless labor strife, class warfare, and squalor of Belfast 100 years ago wears rather thin.  The romance that was depicted was nowhere near as compelling as what James Cameron put on the screen in 1997.  And the heavy accents of the foreign actors in ""Titanic: Blood & Steel"" made following dialogue a struggle.

Summing up, we can't give this miniseries more than two stars in our rating when compared to other productions.  A lot of time, money, and effort obviously went into ""Titanic: Blood & Steel.""  It's a shame that better editing wasn't done to make it more watchable.",1350259200,4,1959,4.884848484848485
5311015,4,B009AVCALC,"It's been awhile since a miniseries this good crossed the Atlantic. ""Titanic: Blood & Steel"" proves there are still ways to approach material that has been revisited on the big and small screens in new and appealing ways. From the laying of the hull to her departure from Belfast, this is the story of the workers, businessmen, and common Irishmen impacted through the construction process of the most famous ship in history.

The year is 1909. American businessman J.P. Morgan (Chris Noth) has provided the financial banking for three magnificent ships, his favorite among them the RMS Titanic. Ambitious young Marc Meur (Kevin Zegers) is eager to be in at the ground floor. Fresh off steel-testing for an American warship, he offers his services to Morgan's business partner Lord Pirrie (Derek Jacobi) to ensure that their ship is the safest, most reliable vessel at sea. Taken under the wing of the ship's designer, Thomas Andrews (Billy Carter), it doesn't take Marc long to settle in... and start having serious doubts about the way Titanic is being constructed. But that is the least of Belfast's problems.

The shipping yard is faced with strife when popular liberal unionist Jim Larkin (Liam Cunningham) tries to rally the Irish workers. Lovely young copier Sofia (Alessandra Mastronardi) is caught up in the movement, much to the distress of her traditional Italian father. Then, there is the aristocratic Kitty (Ophelia Lovibond), vying for the attention of Marc. Over three years, the miniseries plays out against a backdrop of political upheaval and unrest, board inquiries as to whether or not the White Star ships are ""too big,"" and the collision of the Olympic's impact on the construction of Titanic's hull.

The series' strengths are its historical figures, such as the open-minded Pirrie (Jacobi at his finest) and the perfectionist, driven Andrews, who is depicted as I have always imagined him to be, soft-spoken and heroic. Its weaknesses lie in its lack of understanding for the social and sexual aspects of the period as well as its unlikable leading man. When it comes to historical accuracy, it relies more on fiction than fact to tell its story but somehow it never seems too troubling. The politics of the era are explored: the struggle to unionize Ireland, the rivalries between Catholic and Protestant fractions, even a foray into the beginnings of the Irish Republican Army.

It's an expensive miniseries and it shows not only in the terrific cast but the incredible detail on the ships, their construction, the shipyards, and the lavish interiors. It's proof that no topic is ever overdone to such an extent that it can't be approached through a new perspective. The conclusion is ominous and the futures of everyone (save poor Andrews) are unclear, for the series ends as Titanic embarks on her icy maiden voyage with most of the main cast aboard. Some might see its abrupt conclusion as disappointing, but for me it left the characters in a happy situation that enables us to make up our own conclusion toward their fates -- whether or not our preferences are practical.

While I didn't like all its nuances, it held my attention and gave me twelve hours spent in the companionship of Lord Pirrie and Thomas Andrews... and as an amateur RMS Titanic historian, for that, I'm grateful.",1350172800,4,3316,4.978339350180505

While mostly a fictional account, the movie combines all the elements of a major Hollywood epic including romance,soap opera, political intrigue,religious persecution and class rivalry and even a little mystery thrown in for good measure.

8538778,1,B009AVCALC,"Overblown soap opera that occasionally mentions....now what was the name of that boat,er,  ship?  I'm 3/4 of the way through it and seriously wondering if I'm gonna make it to the end.  The parts about the construction of the Titanic are fascinating, but is soon as we start to get into discussing the engineering/construction aspects of the project, the story drifts  back to the trials of the 1.) amoral metallurgist who hops in and out of bed with anything in a skirt, and then frets over his lost, adopted ""love child"" . 2.)  boring, tedious workers who keep spending more time talking about striking and fighting  anyone who doesn't agree and sympathize with their sad plight in the unfair world of shipyard workers.  3.) The Italian guy's  amorous daughters, who either get knocked up and pregnant, or are well on their way to getting so as well. 4) The pathetic schlub who keeps pining over the one daughter who has been hopping in and out of bed with the metallurgist. 5)  and all the boring aristocrats who are caught up in keeping the lower classes  downtrodden, and who keep cutting corners on the construction material for the now what was it we were talking about?  Anyway, if they got down to the nitty-gritty of building the ship and not wasting all the time with all the boring sex and political melodramatics of Belfast , Ireland, the series could've been done  in three hours, easy. I can only recommend this to the Titanic completist,  who has to have every single  production about the great ship that was ever put on video.
ADDENDUM :  well, I've just finished this, and after sitting through almost 12 hours of build up, most of the surviving characters get on board the Titanic and sail off into history... But, and this is a very big BUT...we never find out who lives and survives, and who doesn't,  including a minor character who ends up going to do some espionage work aboard the ship. I didn't care for this so I really didn't care who did survive ,  but if you did get caught up in all the melodramatics, you might actually care, and that would be a shame because no continuation was ever made of the series.
