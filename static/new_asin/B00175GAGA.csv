8264843,3,B00175GAGA,"After hiring Big Mike to help with her failing nightclub operation, owner Dani has a 'brainstorm'. She will target four teenage girls who begin a budding flirtation with sexuality and introduce them to a few of her more ""forward thinking"" clientele. While cash will be exchanged, its clear the young gals will be doing the dirty deeds purely for kicks. With their friend Bismuth acting as bodyguard and pimp, our lovelies indulge in the debauched fantasies of the club's kinky customers. Of course, what these little lovelies don't realize is that Mike is lurking in the background, taking incriminating photos and making scandalous recordings to use as blackmail. With this influx of extorted cash, Dani's banking on saving her failing business. What she may not be prepared for is the response of these so-called 'Little Girls', or the consequences that ensue. My favorite line: ""Anything you want! Come on - let's live like PIGS!"" The girls actually appear closer to college age than highschool, but 60`s fashion did that to girls, so why quibble with the sordid details of kitschy French exploitation? If you like great trash like 'Faster, Pussycat...', you should love this one.",1274745600,10,1183,5.0717948717948715
8264844,2,B00175GAGA,I purchased this movie thinking it was going to some very out there type of a movie and it definitely was not. First of all it was black and white (advertisement didn't say that) and secondly this definitely isn't much of an out there movie. You don't see anything in this film and the narration could have done without.,1226793600,16,320,4.440677966101695
