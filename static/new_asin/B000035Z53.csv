7916739,4,B000035Z53,"I enjoyed watching the fantastic claymation during this nice re-telling of the story of Abraham. It is very old of course (VHS) and the video quality is as if someone copied it illegally. Very grainy and the color is just horrible. My kids still enjoyed it as did I. It is nice to collect. I did not like the scene where Abraham was about to kill his son. Althoug it is true to the story, if you watch it with kids, it is not a nice scene to watch with a father holding a dagger over his child which in this movie, is not depicted as a young man, but literally a little boy. I felt that the story could have been told as it typically is in such movies, with Abraham leading the boy to the altar and then just infering the rest until God tells him not to harm the child or by blocking the view of the child on the altar or simply not showing the knife. It does not really need to be shown this way. The child looks to be about 5 or 6 and you will likely  have a lot of explaining to do to calm their fears. Good for adult collectors.",1356652800,,1032,3.9615384615384617
7916740,5,B000035Z53,"This is the VHS version, a DVD is also available here at Amazon.com, which is the one I have.  This is the biblical the story of Abraham, of the Old Testament in the bible. It is a great version of this story. Each title in the ""Testament: Bible in Animation"" series is done in a different style of animation, some are stop motion, some are traditional hand drawn cel animation, and one is oil paintings on cel. This Abraham story is done in stop motion model animation, and is terrific. This is not made just for kids, but for all ages. The story is smart and intelligent. The animation is very high quality and stylized, and you can they took so much time to get it right. The story/script flows in such a way as to keep an adult very interested. There are obviously some changes made to keep the story flowing and down to 30 minutes, but nothing insulting.  If you like stop model animation, I highly recommend Joseph from this series, it is among the best stop-animation I have ever seen.

The Testament series, produced over 10 years ago by Christmas films in Wales and Russia for the BBC, is not made just for kids, but for all ages. I believe HBO Family Channel aired these for awhile some years ago. There are other VHS or DVD's in the series that are stand alone title's, also about 30 minutes each. The series includes 8 titles ""Daniel"", ""David and Saul"",""Moses"", ""Jonah"", ""The Creation and Noah"", ""Elijah"" (my favorite), ""Ruth"", ""Joseph"", and Abraham. The last 3 are in stop motion animation, like the holiday TV specials).
If you are looking for a good deal, there is another set from the same company that has 4 of the 30 minute stories from this Testament series in a 2 DVD box set. ""Testament: The Bible in Animation Collection"" is the title to search for, and Amazon.com is where I bought it. The price is almost the same as buying one individual story. That set has Jonah, Abraham, Elijah, and the Creation/Noah story. I highly recommend all in the series.",1259625600,,1973,4.5210084033613445
