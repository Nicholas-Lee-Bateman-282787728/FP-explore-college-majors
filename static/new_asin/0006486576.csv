1466,4,0006486576,"This film is taken right from the book of Luke which many believe to be the book of the Bible that gives the most complete and accurate picture of Jesus' life.  If you watch the movie with a Bible open to Luke you'll be able to follow right along.  Brian Deacon plays the most believable Jesus (other than Robert Powell in the 1977 mini-series ""Jesus of Nazareth) in any film, especially those done recently.  The only drawback to this film is that it is quite wordy and at times moves slowly.  The crucifiction scenes, however, are very, very powerful.  ""Jesus"" has been shown worldwide to over 1 billion people and it has been translated into over 400 different languages.  Until recently, this film has not been widely available and I'm thrilled that Amazon.com has made it more readily available.  I highly recommend ""Jesus"" to anyone who wants an accurate visual telling of the story of Jesus' life without the use of ""dramatic license"" as has been the trend recently.",975283200,67,973,4.72189349112426

1498,3,0006486576,"I was initially moved by this film when I saw it on its theatrical release. It is a simplistic, realistic retelling of the Gospel of Luke. Now more than thirty years later, it doesn't resonate as well. More recent productions of the same storyline are more emotional, awestruck and have better photography and musical scores, but this version of Jesus is a pure bread and butter version especially suited for those not yet familiar with the teachings of Jesus and need an initiation presented in a plain and simple way. A few years ago, this same evangelical production company created a wrap-around version of the film centered on the conversion of Mary Magdaline which, oddly enough, seemed more affecting than the original.",1404432000,,726,4.959016393442623

1505,5,0006486576,"There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.

The 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.

Mr. Gibson's ""The Passion"" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)

This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense ""The Passion.""

This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the ""Gospel According to Luke.""  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.

Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.

I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read ""Luke,"" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.

The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in ""The Passion."" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.

Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,"" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.

Another thing I should point out is that ""The Passion"" is NOT child friendly. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of ""The Passion."" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from ""Luke."" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in ""The Passion.""

Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written ""Good News Bible.""

I like ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""The Passion."" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.",1396569600,2,3050,4.478339350180505

1518,5,0006486576,"So often, we view Jesus as just that, a product. Rather than let his law define us and how we should live, we take our own limited and broken experience and apply it to Jesus from which we derive expectations of Him. We rail against Him when these expectations are not met, and applaud smugly when they are. What we forget is that Jesus is God, and that He has surpassed anything that we could ever expect. He is greater than our expectations. When I look at my own life, I realize that all the sadness and misery I've experienced has resulted from putting my hopes and expecations in things that are not of God. The Bible tells us that whatever does not come from God is not good, and yet I place my trust in it anyway. In my sin, I desire a quick, selfish satisfaction, and I expect that coming from things I can measure. This much money, or these many relationships, or this much time spent on mindless entertainment. Whatever entertains me for a duration of time, however superficial it may be, I'll devote myself to because it's what I arbitrarily want. But I'm never satisfied completely or without guilt after I seek to please myself and not God. What I forget is that I have a Savior who came to give life and life abundantly. What Jesus has given us goes beyond measure. All we have to do is surrender to Him. Give up our life in idolatry and sin, which only leads to death, and turn to Jesus, the light of the world and source of life abundant. I know why Jesus is Saviour, and in recognition of that, desire him to be Lord of my life. I cannot 'rate' him, because I'm not worthy but hope that he will rate me as one of His own, so that I may one day hear God say to me, ""Well done, my good and faithful servant"".

1531,4,0006486576,"Didn't know Brian  Deacon. Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten. AT the beginning of this movie it will tell you which apostle and now I too am a fan of his, too bad I had forgotten which one he was. :-)  made the story and the words have power again. Those who haven't seen this movie, I recommend it and you would know what I cannot describe. There is even a version for children which I didn't buy so I can't write my opinion about it. I love the scene with the children, and the one wherein the pharisees tried to trick him. And that before entering Jerusalem, many more. You have seen and heard them before but it's just different, powerful in its simple delivery. The scene where he was teaching in the forest and one follower asked something; oh, and that of the woman who had put coins for tithes, moving, many others in this movie. I have so many favorite scenes and verses from this film.

Oh, and btw, this can be played in different languages. That new friend i had mentioned is  married to a Japanese who is not Christian and the couple was able to watch this together and the friend said he liked it and his wife did, too.

 I had high expectations, based on the reviews I read.

I applaud all those who were involved in this project for their desire and efforts to spread the Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for NOTHING is more crucial to our world today than God's True Agape Love.  But, in my opinion, Almighty God deserves a higher effort.

The message itself is highly accurate, and THAT is the most important thing. As a teaching tool, this film can be very useful. But the acting, the tone, the pace & delivery of the dialogue, and the overall production is quite dry and slow. If you're looking to be ""entertained"", this is not the production for you.

It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film. Recommended. 4/5.",1343001600,,596,4.283185840707965

1538,5,0006486576,I highly recommend this movie on dvd for a Christian witnessing tool and a reminder over the holidays particuliarly Easter and Christmas what they are trully about. And to Christians as a refresher now and again of who Christ is and should be in our lives.  Taken from the Gospel of Luke and easy to follow with a bible in hand.,1337299200,,328,4.377049180327869

1541,5,0006486576,"The best thing about this film is the fact that it adheres to the Bible as it is written.  Hollywood took no liberties or artistic license.  You hear the Scripture exactly as it is written in the book of Luke.  The places where it was filmed are real, and the costumes and actors look authentic.
It is probably the only Bible film that doesn't take from or add to the Word of God.  Other films, like Jesus Of Nazereth; the Ten Commandments; The Nativity; the Passion of the Christ; etc.  have added to or left things out for the purpose of pushing their own agendas.  There is a strict warning in Scripture itself.

I was intrigued because I own ""The gospel of John"" which is by far the best Jesus movie I have ever seen and is word for word, straight from the book of John.  Enjoying how a movie was made from the unadulterated word of God, I got ""Jesus"" which claims to be from the book of Luke. I tried to follow along and realized exactly how much is left out.  Quite a bit is left out and parts that could be narrated are visually shown instead.  That was why I liked ""The Gospel of John""  everything that was written was either spoken by the actors or the narrator in the movie.  Nothing was added and nothing was taken away.  Unfortunately, I was hoping for the same thing in this movie and was slightly disappointed.  It wasn't a raping of scriptures as some movies are and just want to recreate Jesus in their own fictional ideal, but it wasn't perfect either.  You could definitely learn from and enjoy the movie, but I highly recommend ""The Gospel of John"" more.",1297641600,7,1005,4.360215053763441

Since it is almost word for word from the Bible, except for a few conversational interactions, such as greetings, etc., you can be sure it is true to God's word.  One thing I love about it is that it shows Him as a strong man (He WAS a carpenter, after all.) rather than a milk toast as He is usually depicted.  The only thing I did not like was that since they wanted to stay true to the book of John, they didn't put a crown of thorns on his head, because although Matthew, Mark, and Luke all do describe the crown, John does not.  Yet, you can't fault their resolve to be absolutely true to that account.  If you saw Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ movie, and felt the crucifiction scenes were a little too much for younger children, then this is the best choice out of all other movies made.",1252800000,3,882,4.195266272189349

It would be much better to have the whole series in a box set.",1221177600,,355,4.235294117647059
1556,5,0006486576,"This is my favorite film on the life of Jesus.  It is based on the Gospel of Luke.  Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.

It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that ""they are for the children"" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks ""who acted as this man's neighbor?"" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.

In the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, ""only a mite?"" ""can't she give more?"" ""it's very little.""  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.",1208044800,4,1334,4.485477178423237

It is also updated to include Digital Dolby Surround Sound!  The DVD also includes the making of the Jesus Film in a ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary.  This is the DVD you want to watch if you want an accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus.",1176508800,6,568,4.65
1559,5,0006486576,"The Jesus Film is truly a phenomenon and great tool for reaching many people to understand the Jesus that is described in the Gospel of Luke.  The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.

The Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.

Brian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.

Many of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).

What is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.

There are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:

Besides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.

There is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.

Even though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.

I bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  I highly recommend this film, along with ""The Gospel of John.""",1175644800,39,3475,4.820945945945946

1567,5,0006486576,"""Jesus, His Life, Mystery and Message"" is a marvelous film on the life and times of Jesus, and though in its 10 chapters it skips around a bit, and there is an occasional slip in the script, those familiar with Scripture will appreciate this ambitious project, and the content that is biblically based, as well as the visual presentation. An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.

It delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity. I give it 5 stars for making the most of a low budget production. Total running time is 160 minutes.",1128038400,5,1743,4.969178082191781

1569,5,0006486576,"Taking five years to research and produce, this 1979 film is meticulous in its recreation of the time of Jesus. It uses over 200 locations in the Holy Land, many actors from the region, and is based on portions of the Gospel of Luke.
This is the film used by over 1,500 denominations and missions to evangelize, and it has been translated into 877 languages and shown to over five billion people in 228 countries, and is an excellent ""tool"" for this purpose, because it is simple and at the same time very powerful and moving.

British actor Brian Deacon is a wonderful Jesus, with a soft but manly voice and perfect enunciation, making the words of Jesus come to life in a very special way.
Others of note are Niko Nitai as Simon Peter, Rivka Neuman as Mary, Talia Shapira as Mary Magdalene, and the part of John the Baptist (played by Eli Cohen) is short, but physically the closest I have seen on film to what I imagine the real John looked like.
Richard Kiley narrates as Luke, and also listed as narrator is Alexander Scourby.
Directed by John Kirsh and Peter Sykes, it has some terrific passages; one of my favorites is the storm at sea (Luke 8:22-25), which is very effective, and the cinematography by Mike Reed, and the locations, a pleasure to watch.

The film ends with an invitation to salvation, and with it the promise of ""a full, abundant life, filled with purpose and meaning"", and with a quote from Revelation 3:20: ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him"".

1570,5,0006486576,"To claim that Jesus Christ did not even exist is mere ignorance. Such preposterous claims belie a desire for some illusion of moral or intellectual superiority. The argument is nothing but a straw man easily knocked down. There is plenty of historical and archaeological evidence to support the FACT that Jesus Christ did in fact exist. The Jesus movie is a good introduction to his life and teachings but by no means comprehensive (for that you need the Bible).
If you're sincere in your search for the Truth, I highly recommend reading Josh McDowell's book, More Than a Carpenter, as an easy first read. Available at Amazon.com, of course.
It's reasonable to question Jesus' deity if you've only heard the name and never seriously investigated His life. Those who have, including the hard-nosed skeptics who set out to debunk this thing called Christianity, often become Christians themselves. Those who don't generally do so out of mere pride -- an unwillingness to sacrifice their old, comfortable beliefs that allow them to live an ungodly lifestyle. But you reject Jesus at your own peril. It's the very height of folly.
As for my opinion of the Jesus the movie? Why not judge for yourself! You can watch the entire movie streamed online at jesusfilm.org in any of 62 languages (of the 858 it's been translated into)! Then you can decide whether or not to purchase the DVD.
I do recommend this film. I also recommend, highly, 2003's The Gospel of John. It is extremely faithful to the New Testament book of John and really brings life and a better understanding to the life, times, and teachings of Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.
I wish you well and pray that God may draw you to Him (that you may be receptive to His call). Perhaps I'll see you in heaven someday. If you have honest seeking questions, you're welcome to e-mail me at robvh at wellness5.com.",1087603200,20,1864,4.756172839506172

While films like ""The Passion of the Christ"" present more emotion and Hollywood glitz, ""Jesus"" is painstaking in its accuracy. The complete life story is presented based on the biography compiled 2,000 years ago by a doctor named Luke. The film is a plain and simple docudrama that many families make a tradition of viewing every Christmas and Easter.

This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.
The movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.
The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.",1083196800,19,3289,4.7272727272727275

They leave out so many years and do not fully explain or dramatize very important details.  Filmed in Israel.  This film does include Jesus was ""alive"" (arisen) from the tomb, spoke to his diciples and then in 40 days ascended into the clouds (from Earth to Heaven).  I am not condemning this film version because I know this film has helped so many people believe in God and Jesus in many countries.  But for a really in depth, detailed and very emotional account of the life of Jesus, I highly recommend,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;(1977).",1079308800,5,1249,6.349112426035503
1576,2,0006486576,"Slavishly faithful to the Gospel of Luke, this by-the-numbers retelling of Jesus's life never develops dramatic momentum.  As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.
Some continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)
Extras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).
The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.
Catholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a ""personal relationship with God"" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.  That's no surprise, though, considering that the film was financed by the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ.",1064188800,17,1470,5.283261802575107
1577,4,0006486576,"Before I begin my review, I must state something: Having Been translated into over 700 languages, this film has been seen by more than 4 Billion people since its release in 1979 (over 60 Million who saw it have dedicated their lives to the blessed Savior).
THE REVIEW
This is a really good film. It has the power to truly change lives. Brian Deacon shines as Jesus. The things that detract from the film are mediocre acting by most of the supporting cast and some choppy editing. Other than this, a truly mesmerizing movie experience. But the best film version of the Gospels is the 2000 Miniseries version starring Jeremy Sisto (I also here that Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion"" is really good, but I won't decide until I see it this Easter).
Note: This is the 120 Minute Version. I own (and prefer) the 83 Minute Version of the film. Grade: B+",1062028800,6,844,4.522875816993464
1578,5,0006486576,"This is an evangilistic movie shown around the world (the DVD has a choice of about 8 languages) of the highlights of the ministry of Jesus, according to the gospel of Luke.  It is a very well produced and acted documentary, bringing dramatic visual imagery to biblical scripture.  Intended to introduce people of all nations to Jesus, is should also appeal to those Christians who appreciate adding another dimension to their biblical experience.  This is a 2 DVD set, with the second DVD geared for children.",1056326400,46,510,4.906976744186046

1581,3,0006486576,"Very accurate telling of the Gospel according to Luke.  What concerns me about this movie is the portrayal of Jesus.  Like most movies of the life of Jesus, our Lord and Savior is portrayed in very somber terms, almost inhuman in a way.
In real life, Jesus was one of us.  He was part man, part God.  Without sin, but fully enjoying of his time on this Earth
But the story line was execptionally accurate (unlike most tellings of the Gospel) and if you can deal with a Jesus character who seems removed from his surroundings, then this movie will be a great buy for you.",1024012800,15,570,4.349056603773585

1583,4,0006486576,"This Jesus film is true to the Gospel of Luke.  That is good and bad.  It sticks very close to the Gospel of Luke and avoids the Hollywood straying which most Jesus films undertake.  However, because it is so closely tied to Luke, there is no crown of thorns on the head of Jesus (which is not mentioned in Luke).  Because I am a stickler for accuracy, I think this is the best Jesus film available, even without the crown of thorns.",1009584000,6,433,4.2439024390243905
1584,3,0006486576,"This movie, made by the Genesis Project and was released  in theaters nationwide in the early 80's, is unfornuately, boring.  The directing is of novice caliber and the acting very forgetful.  Based on the Gospel of Luke, it fails to give an emotional impact.  I know they wanted to make a great film, but instead, they made an uninspiring account of the life of Christ.
This movie has been hailed by so many layity and pastors as a great witnessing tool.  If this is true, then the movie accomplished something good, however, I find it hard to believe anyone can set through it without falling asleep.  Read the Gospel of Luke instead.
Watch Jesus of Nazareth if you must watch a gospel movie.  This movie, however, is better than King of Kings and is on equal footing as The Greatest Story Ever Told in enterianment value.",1000425600,5,824,4.602739726027397
1585,4,0006486576,"The stories of Jesus' conception and birth are recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This movie is based on Luke's account. The story begins with a prologue to summarize Jesus' life as a child and to bring the story into focus. John Heyman researched this film for five years and then filmed it in over 200 locations in the Holy Land.

Over one billion people have viewed this work and it has been translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries. The Epic story of the most controversial life in human history could barely be covered in one movie, so this is more of an overview of Jesus' life.

In 83 minutes, this story will make you want to know more about a man who walked the earth, knowing he would die to give man the ultimate gift - Eternal Life. Throughout the movie, Jesus speaks in parables to teach his followers truth. He calls his disciples and empowers them to convey God's messages to a wider audience.

Jesus' Miracles in this movie included the Feeding of the 5,000, Calming the Storm, Raising Jairus' Daughter, and giving site to the blind. The Last Supper is portrayed and then the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus starts to make this movie more dramatic. This movie very briefly touches on all the trials and then draws you into the emotional aspects of Jesus' Crucifixion. When he triumphs over death and is raised from the dead he appears in bodily form to show that he is indeed alive.

The story ends with Jesus ascending into the clouds [....]

I recommend this movie to all who want to know how to leave this world alive. This movie left me with a feeling of love for Jesus Christ, who gave his life for us so we can spend an eternity in heaven with our Creator, God.

1587,2,0006486576,"While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!",988588800,8,841,5.057553956834532
