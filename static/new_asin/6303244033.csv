606277,5,6303244033,This is an addition to my collection of the Ozzie & Harriet Show.  I wish some TV network would pick up reruns of this show; it's a classic in TV shows. Thank you for sharing these shows with the public.  It's fun to go back in time.,1179360000,3,233,3.9361702127659575

606279,3,6303244033,"Unfortunately there are no true full collections of Ozzie and Harriet episodes out there, only many pockets of mismatched groupings.  This beloved series is my family's favorite. We simply cannot get enough of O&H.

With regards to the previous review, are there more comprehensive collections that offer any better quality than this one?  I'm familiar with one other collection that essentially has the same episode listings with a different Cover Logo but haven't compared the quality of those myself.  People should be informed where to go in order to get the best quality DVDs for this show and the most complete set.  As far as I've seen, this comes close in terms of Episodes (50 / 435) but not necessarily so on the quality.",1154390400,7,731,4.862903225806452
606280,5,6303244033,"The Adventures of Ozzie And Harriet - a pleasant perusal of the real life Nelson family portraying the fictional middle American family, The Nelsons.  Viewing the first disc, and keeping an open mind as to the date of the material, I found myself chuckling at most of the punchlines and wishing I had a neighbor like Thorny.  Ozzie's dry wit, Harriet's clever come backs, Ricky and his 'early' precociousness with David portraying the straight man provide silly and harmless laughs for anyone.

The quality of this set?  Horrible, by today's standards.  With 435 episodes in the public domain and really only appealing to an older demographic, we may never see the digital restoration this American treasure deserves.  So for the time being just enjoy this delightful set that spans over the entire run of the series.  I sure wish I could get a cool job like Oz has!",1149811200,17,866,4.8108108108108105
606281,3,6303244033,"I just received this set today. I mainly got it because there are a handful of episodes in this set that I don't have. In all fairness, the quality of these episodes isn't all that great, as stated by another person. I offer the following explanation as to why this is. First off, all of the episodes in this set are in public domain. That means that anyone can copy them without copyright infringement. That is why most of these episodes are available from so may different companies on DVD & VHS. Second, all of these episodes have been copied from 16mm films. I believe that during the show's initial run, many of the episodes were transfered to 16mm film to be shown overseas to our armed forces stationed in other countries. (The Amos n' Andy show was also transfered to 16mm for the same reason) This is also true of the last season of Ozzie & Harriet, which was shown on TV in color. For some reason, the color episodes were copied in black & white and transfered to 16mm film. Unfortunately, time has not been very kind to these films, many of the older films have faded with age or have been spliced and taped together and the end result is blurry and jumpy pictures, the audio usually suffers too. There are roughly 50 to 60 episodes of this series in public domain. There may be less, this is just a guess on my part. The rest of the episodes that are not in public domain, roughly 360 are copyrighted and the copyright belongs to Mr. David Oswald Nelson, the only surviving member of the original TV family. It's up to him to release the rest of the episodes. Hopefully, one day soon he will do this.. I'm almost certain there are original copies in the Library of Congress, but as to what condition they are in is anybody's guess. So, I will only recommend this to a diehard, ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" fan. They may not be the best, but they are the only thing out there at the moment and the episodes are all still very watchable.",1148947200,30,1954,4.3856749311294765
606282,4,6303244033,"Since these shows are pretty old, 50's/60's timeframe, quality is not the absolute best, but still quite good.  I enjoyed watching these shows very much as I grew up watching them on tv and became a Rick Nelson fan.  I would recommend this DVD for any fan of the Nelson family.",1140220800,5,277,4.411764705882353

606284,4,6303244033,"First of all I will give an information Amazon often misses to give - the info which episodes are on the DVD. This is quite important since there are so many compilations of this show and no complete season boxes (why not?) around. Episodes on this DVD are: ""Maid of honor"", ""Rick grows a beard"",""Be on time"",""Rick's Riding Lesson"" and ""Busy Christmas"".

My review is based on the first two episodes only, but I guess that`s enough to review the technical quality of the DVD (I assume people interested in this DVD mostly know what this show is about).

The picture quality is not High Definition of course, but better than expected. A season box should have a digital remaster better than this DVD, but still the quality is okay. Same is true for the sound quality.

For this reasonable price you get a DVD well worth it's money. For Rick Nelson fans a must, if they don`t have this episodes by now.",1131148800,25,900,4.50920245398773

606286,5,6303244033,I love these and so do my children!  I love the old shows with no drinking and cussing and Mom and Dad have wholesome views on life and marriage!  These DVD's are fabulous and the picture is fabulous considering when they were filmed.  We have never had a problem with them!!  HIGHLY recommended!,1106870400,2,296,4.528301886792453

7841725,3,6303244033,"I rated this one - like the other double set in the series - 3 stars, because the tapes are recorded at slow speed. This means the sound and picture are not the best, although very watchable/listenable. The shows themselves are great fun. The first ep, ""The Motorcycle"", has actual footage of David Nelson riding a bike up (as he calls it) ""motorcycle hill"" and falling off the bike - don't worry, he doesn't get hurt. Ozzie and Harriet's concerns about him buying a bike lead Ozzie to take Dave on a fishing trip so they can have a chance to talk things over - which they never quite get around to. ""Ozzie's Night Out"" is an early ep, when Dave was in his early teens, and Ricky was the irrepressible wisecracking kid brother. Don Defore is featured as the Nelson's next door neighbor, Thorny - still my favorite non-Nelson regular on the show. A talk between Oz and Thorny about bowling leads to Ozzie spending a night on the town - although not quite the kind of night you would expect. Rick, Dave and goofy Wally Plumstead are featured in the ""Fraternity Pin"" episode - and watch out for Wally's girlfriend Ginger. I would not want to double cross her! The final ep, ""Wally's Traffic Ticket"", is from the final season of the show (and should be in color here, but it's not). Only Wally Plumstead could blame running a stop sign on an ostrich! Rick sings ""Your Kinda Lovin"" at the end - and watch for a promo spot for the then new ""Batman"" series with Commissioner Gordon himself, Neil Hamilton. It's really nice that these tapes include the original commercials. TV sure has changed since the 50's and 60's.",1301961600,,1611,4.52054794520548
7841726,3,6303244033,"If you're a fan of the Ozzie and Harriet show, you will love these episodes. Unfortunately, Madacy is one of those companies that puts out low quality product. Both tapes in the set were recorded in SLP mode, meaning the sound and picture aren't nearly as good as they should be. If you can overlook that flaw, the shows are a lot of fun to watch. The first ep, Father's Night at the Frat, has Dave and Rick's fraternity trying to raise money to build a swimming pool. Rick sings ""Mighty Good"" in this ep. The second ep, The Frat Rents a Room, features Wally Cox as a professor who tortures his students with tough assignments. It only gets worse when he moves into a room at the frat house. David and the Teenager concerns a neighbor girl who becomes quite fond of David - who, by this time, is happily married. The Nelsons Decide to Move is probably the funniest of these shows, with a hilarious dream sequence where Ozzie imagines he and Harriet moving into an apartment.",1301875200,,974,4.446927374301676
