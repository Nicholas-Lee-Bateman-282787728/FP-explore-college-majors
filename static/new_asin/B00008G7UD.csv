7983117,3,B00008G7UD,"The DVD for the most part covers only the rhythm parts of the songs and on several songs the lead part is actually not mentioned at all. Check out this demonstration of how to play ""War Pigs"" without the solo section or the outro. You'd be much better off to buy the cd version of this which has all of the parts to most of the songs as well as songs not on the DVD such as  ""Heaven and Hell"" w/the ending omitted, ""Symptom of The Universe"" without the solo or bridge and also features ""Supernaut"".
This DVD has Troy ""demonstrating"" Iommi's riffs with all the enthusiasm of somebody walking in their sleep. He doesn't play the full songs but merely repeats each riff a couple of times and explains when to hammer on and pull off and that's about it. This is very disappointing and noticeably lame.
The cd version with the book by the same author is far superior. Although thebook and cd requires a bit more concentration as well as the ability to sight read at least is far more beneficial in the long run.",1190073600,8,1006,4.351063829787234
