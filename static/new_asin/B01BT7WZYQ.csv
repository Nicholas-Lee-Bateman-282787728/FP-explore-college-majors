Of course one never knows complete accuracy.  But, this gave me some possible insights.  We will never know for sure.",1492300800,2,279,5.111111111111111

If you want to see a real remote viewer do something spectacular that can be independently verified, then see Aaron C. Hanson.

One of them namely Dick Allgire latter used his data to make an independent documentary called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Really-Happened-To-Adolf-Hitler/dp/B01FV0V7YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Really Happened To Adolf Hitler?</a>""  In a YouTube video promoting it he publicly said about Adolf Hitler ""I don't think he was a psychopath, I don't think he was a mass murderer."" This tells you all you need to no about how fair or otherwise Courtney Brown was in putting together this documentary.

If it's correct Adolf Hitler didn't die in the bunker, and there seems to be an exchange of nuclear secrets. This independent documentary is worthy of serious consideration.",1474416000,2,913,6.015384615384615
