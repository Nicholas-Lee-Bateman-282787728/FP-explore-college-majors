Woooo I liked it when he took off his shirt and was fighting in his muscle tank with Johnny on top of the car! (Ok, I'll quit being girly now) Although, it doesn't have that many fighting scenes, it's not boring as some people would say. Some parts are really great! Like when May teaches Jet how to drive and then kisses him (I loved that part! It's too bad Jet Li doesn't kiss anybody else in his other movies, hehe!) And I like the part where he was teaching the mexicans kung fu. If you really like Jet Li, you totally should watch this movie! Sure, it's not the best, but I own it, and love it! I payed a LOT of money for it too, so it's good that I like it! LOL",985737600,,807,3.896969696969697

RIDDLE OF THE GOLD is also a classic with Zin about a gold smuggling operation in India. Plus a bonus world premier tune and a classic Space Ghost episode featuring Zorak!  Memorable huh?

735847,5,630395331X,"DVD Review: ""Excuse me! Can you translate my English to him so that his English can understand mine?"" Ugh! Stupid Dimension Films. And on a further note: I hate a lot of Chinese music soundtracks, particularly the montage stuff so the Americanized music was a lot better. But still the English dubbing was abysmal mostly due to incoherence. But eh well!

Blu Ray Review: The CMS Media Limited version. Excellent video transfer and the picture quality is good. The sound is good and in original Chinese form. I HATE THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK but oh well. And it plays on American Blu-Ray just in case you have some level of doubt. And no extras other than a dumb-a$$ trailer.

Movie Review: This movie may not live up to the standards of some Jet Li fans as the fight sequences have a more American feel to it kinda like Bloodsport (Van Damme) or something. Or perhaps the story and its satirical tone will f*** people up and make them insane. Unfortunately, I liked it. It does have that Tsui Hark touch of inconsistent tone. Example: Having a cute and funny moment then suddenly have a grisly blood splatter scene in the next but if you know Tsui Hark, you know his level of eccentricity. AND I LOVE IT! The story was good and consistent, some characters were good as others should of died from the word ""GO"", the action scenes were fun to watch but is not in traditional Chinese kung fu choreography, and all that. I did, however, HATE the soundtrack and the stupid montage. Montages NEED TO GO AWAY in Chinese cinema because they annoying and they suck!!!!!

Conclusion: 4 1/2 for the Blu-Ray, 3 for the Dimension Film DVD version and 4 stars for The Master.",1427760000,,1659,4.579124579124579

735913,1,630395331X,"This DVD is rubbish.  Wolf runs through each riff once at speed and once barely slower then it's onto a clip of Hendrix which may or may not be related to the riff and that's it. There are no on screen tabs or other instructions. You never see his right hand so you can't work out rhythm patterns and certainly no ""master class"" tips.  Wolf never even says what string or fret or note he is on, how deep a bend is or how strong a trill - sure, you can work it out if you can read the booklet and watch the DVD at the same time but really, he's no help at all.  And if I could work it out from the tabs I wouldn't need to buy the DVD!

The ""booklet"" with the tabs is tiny and in a font that is quite difficult to read.

Worse still is each riff doesn't get it's own DVD chapter so if you want to skip back you might go back 1 or two riffs - no, I should say that sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.

Even worse still in this ""masterclass"" is that Wolf never mentions anything about Amp settings.  He does mention pedals at one stage but then says that he doesn't have one so he'll play the riff anyway. What? He couldn't even get a set of pedals on loan from someone.  Lazy.

735986,3,630395331X,"I was reluctant to buy this video of Lenny Breau when I first saw the product advertised because I didn't see how the production could be any good.  It was made with amateur equipment in the early days of consumer video and that made me suspicious.  But as a hard core fan who collects every recording Lenny ever made, I finally caved in.  Boy, am I glad did.  This is Lenny at his best, playing his new (at that time) Kirk Sand seven-string guitar.  Great sound, great playing, and a very relaxed atmosphere are the result.  Paul LaRose, the then-head of the commercial guitar department at USC, introduces Lenny to a small but enthusiastic group of attendees, and Lenny takes it from there, answering questions from the audience, playing his favorite tunes, and jamming with a bass player.  I'm giving it three stars for the video which- while not bad- is essentially one camera angle.  No snazzy production values here.  However, it doesn't really matter once Lenny gets going.  This is a priceless artifact of Lenny at the height of his abilities made only weeks before he died.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the performance and enthusiastically recommend it.",1312848000,9,1184,4.783251231527093

735988,1,630395331X,"""Master Blaster"" is an obscure throwaway about simulated combat from the 1980's, where it should have been left. I knew there would be trouble when I saw that the Executive Producer was Bill ""Death Curse of Tartu"" Grefe, and my instincts immediately proved correct, starting with the truly odious theme song, which you may actually need to mute to make it through. This film could have just as easily been called ""Battle of the Ugly Rednecks"", which is actually more genuinely descriptive. If the music wasn't enough to chase you off, within the first five minutes or so we discover four separate factions in a bar fight of dubious realism, featuring some truly stupefying mullets.

It turns out that a group of would-be paramilitary buffoons are meeting by invitation only in the woods somewhere (talk about a cheap location) to attend the ""Masterblaster Grand National Championships"" where they compete for 24 hours trying to ""kill"" the others with special guns that shoot ""blood pellets"" while avoiding numerous obstacles. It's obvious that although the entire cast is utterly unlikable that ""The Hawk"" (Jeff Moldovan) is supposed to be the hero. Of course he did two years in Vietnam and therefore has baggage, but he is the least annoying of the characters so he must be the protagonist.

After a very (very) long set of introductions of the various competitors (which pads the running time immensely), some truly trying exposition, a lesson on Kobe beef, and some of the most wretched dancing (huh?) ever, the competition gets underway. Watch the hilarious competition preparation, especially from the tubby ninja. Also of note: the extraordinarily bad dialogue and Vietnam flashback (""There I was...trying to put Lenny's head together....) I also enjoyed the bizarre monologue from a female police officer who said she would be unable to shoot a criminal. (Time for a career change.) This drivel finally turns to action, which essentially boils down to a bunch of moronic guys playing dress up cowboys and Indians in the woods. Fortunately it goes on for a long time. Hello, boredom. As you may have guessed, a real killer joins the fray, and after some pointless doublecrosses, the film ends in one of the most ridiculous conclusions in my rather elephantine cinematic memory.

""Master Blaster"" is a truly dreadful and very cheap effort with a wholly unbalanced plot, poor direction and acting, and no sense of tension whatsoever for a film that's ostensibly a thriller. The theme music will eat it's way into your brain, and the film will annoy you for an hour and a half of your life that you can't ever get back. Even though I'm a dyed-in-the-wool B-movie lover, this was not worth the 99 cents I paid for it a video store that was going out of business. Skip it if you have any idea what's good for you.",1280620800,3,2815,4.884937238493724
735989,3,630395331X,"""The Master"" is definitely one of the less-venerated Jet Li vehicles. To a casual viewer, it's kind of neat to see an earlier film of his that's not an overt period piece, but serious fans will know better. What we have here is an easy-to-watch, easy-to-forget fish-out-of-water story similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumble-in-the-Bronx/dp/0780619331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumble in the Bronx</a>&nbsp;but not nearly as good. At this point in his career, Li was only beginning to form his own style of action movie and was still prone to the strange whims of his directors, and in this case, it's Tsui Hark (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zu-Warriors/dp/B000CDGVOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zu Warriors</a>) who's responsible for some of the questionable weirdness that kept this movie from shining.

The story: martial arts student Jet (Li) travels to America to find his master (Yuen Wah,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Hustle/dp/B00005J4A7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Hustle</a>) missing. In the process of trying to find his teacher and adapt to American life as a tourist, he must confront the evil intentions of dojo leader Jonny (Jerry Trimble), who's responsible for his master's disappearance.

Champion kickboxer Jerry Trimble was an interesting choice for a lead villain in a Jet Li movie. Not a very tall man, he nonetheless towers over Li, bearing a mullet and an arrogant smirk fit only for a Caucasian villain in a Hong Kong film. He'd later pursue a solo career in B-movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-by-the-Fist/dp/B000087F2B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live by the Fist</a>, but I think it's safe to say that he looked most impressive while trading blows with Li in this one. He certainly compliments Li, Wah, henchman Steven Ho (fight double in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-II/dp/B0000696I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II</a>), and several other boisterous fighters of the movie who'd rarely be seen again, but the reason he's not better known these days is probably due this one's fights not really standing out from Li's other fare. Though roundly competent and quite bloody, these aren't the fastest, most creative, or tightly-edited matches Hong Kong has to offer: while you'll get your fix, there's nothing here to make your mouth drop in awe like in, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-China-2/dp/B00005AWRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in China 2</a>.

The non-fighting aspects of the flick are interesting in their own regard. Have fun guessing for yourself the reason behind Jonny's desire to attack all the martial arts masters he can find and why he's so determined to go after Jet's teacher in particular - that part's left very ambiguous. Co-stars include Anne Rickets as a motorcycle-riding tomboy who shacks up the old master in her trailer home, and three young Latinos (the most notable of which is Derek Annunciation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Dog-and-Glory/dp/B0000WN0SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Dog and Glory</a>) who rob Jet and then follow him around obsessively, trying to get him to teach them kung fu. He doesn't, per se, but teaches them to hit dodgeballs with sticks, and somehow this makes them worthy opponents against Jonny's gang. Crystal Kwok, whose sole claim to fame is a small role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragons-Forever/dp/6305261415/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragons Forever</a>, is featured as a reporter who has limited importance to the story but nonetheless gets into a quasi-romantic angle with Jet. Amusingly, the film is a mini-opus of how goofy the Chinese thought Americans acted back in the 80s, so prepare yourself for plenty of head-shaking.

There are enough differences between the Hong Kong release (Zhonghua Records) and the American ""Jet Li Collection"" version to warrant an examination. The Hong Kong version is uncut, featuring a few scenes not shown in the other, but also features instances of debilitating ""pan & scan"" image cropping during fight scenes. I'm not sure if the American release is also reformatted, but it replaces some of the soundtrack for a more bombastic score (I prefer this one, actually) and, while only featuring an English language track, dubs the voices of the American characters better. The humor definitely makes more sense in the Hong Kong edition, but don't let that be a determining factor for you - you're up for a very goofy movie, either way.",1273881600,,4868,6.293853073463269

There were only four tapes in the set but they really captured the best of the series. In fact, if you can't afford the full 26 episode DVD release (and you still have a VHS player) these tapes are still an excellent review or introduction to the classic 1964 series.

First, the warmup is uncoordinated and secondly, when the camera should be on Billy while he's explaining what  to do (or not to do) it's not.

736080,5,630395331X,"This DVD The Master, with Jet Li, is wonderful. Admittedly it may initially disappoint, but this should only happen on first viewing. It is a movie that requires attention to detail (as all masterpieces do) and knowledge of other martial arts movies and legends. Nonetheless, after first viewing (during which time the proverbial penny should drop and deeper understanding commence), there are amazing viewing rewards! In fact, if you should ever want to show off your knowledge to others of the deeper purpose of martial arts and/or Jet Li, well, this is definitely THE movie to have!
First, though, to find the deeper story! So, to help the penny drop and to help find full appreciation of the consummate mastery of this Tsui Hark movie (especially its script), consider the possibility that the Master = Bruce Lee, the first internationally-recognized master of martial arts. On another level, to move closer to the story's higher purpose, consider the Master as the true spirit and/or reason for the practice of martial arts.
Second, consider the possibility that the movie is an extremely respectful criticism of the post-Bruce-Lee commercialism of martial arts (and the resultant use of martial arts in street violence).
Finally, consider the possibility that the martial arts people of the East saw a need to reinforce (via another master: Jet Li) the true spirit and/or reason of martial arts to the people of the West. This last point helps explain why the movie is set in modern-times and why it deliberately avoided the high-wire tricks; the movie is introducing to America the real martial arts mastery of Jet Li. In so doing, it is dealing with real social/cultural issues in a real way with a real and meaningful answer; for that answer watch the non-preaching and non-judgmental corrections to violence in this specific movie!
Now, to match the above viewing suggestions to the movie! The Master opens with the master as a doctor who is physically healing and attempting to mentally heal/warn/correct a macho streetfighter type. In fact, the movie actually links this doctor (via the Po Chi Lum herbal medicine shop) to Wong Fei-Hung. Wong Fei-Hung, you may recall, was the master from Once Upon A Time in China: an all-but-divine hero in Chinese martial arts history who was born in 1849 and who inherited a herbal medicine shop call Po Chi Lum, a shop where he also taught Kung Fu! The dimension and breadth of the movie should now start to tease sensibilities into a state of alertness! Jet Li, of course, had already starred as Wong Fei-Hung in earlier movies (and how!) but, because there is a higher purpose to this story than pure commerce-driven martial arts entertainment, Jet Li does not play the role he immortalized for cinema-goers. Instead, Jet Li plays one of this master's students! Why? Well, in brief, Jet Li is paying homage to the mastering spirits and legacy of martial arts. Why? Well, in brief, that's the lesson the West needs to re-learn; otherwise, the martial arts can be used for violence and destruction, not personal and community peace and safety.
At this point, consider the role that Jet Li plays in this movie: like his master, he is a healer (i.e. of the policemen's ulcers, which also suggests the authorities have not quite learned how to correct and stomach street violence! So, the movie has a social critique at work too! Truly, this story gathers to a giddying greatness the more it is meditated upon! It's great! Then, of course, Jet Li is a man of peace despite, and because of, his great martial arts skills. This is why he won't teach the Latino gang the martial arts (because they will use such skills violently for personal ends, not to help ensure personal and public peace; later in the story, Jet Li teaches them enough to protect themselves. This is a very fine edge of difference; but a critical difference! Jet Li is also a worldly innocent (as beautifully and humorously demonstrated by the one-sided romance).
Of course, all Jet Li's don't-call-me-master positive qualities are in sharp contrast to the call-me-master ""bad"" student's ego-driven mistakes (including the mistake of never having learned what the true purpose of martial arts actually is i.e. mastery over self and the resultant increasingly-perfected personal path to peace! So, as the bad student very capably shows, to challenge and/or kill a master = to lose directions to the true meaning of martial arts = to not be a master; regardless of physical prowess = to be killed by the self as a martial arts exponent). To become a true master (and, thus, find the invisible hands of non-terrestrial-power making you effortlessly invincible), this movie suggests, requires a full willingness to place martial arts in the service of humanity ....!
Actually, enough ... it is time to stop! It will take a book or two to explain this movie ... it is great! There are problems for viewers, certainly, because both before and after this specific movie, Jet Li starred in some of the most sublime action/martial arts movies in the history of world cinema; nevertheless, The Master is also an awesome achievement once the deeper story starts to become visible! Be patient with this movie, it will reward ... a masterpiece is patiently and respectfully waiting to speak to you! Be warned: when the glory of the story starts to gather momentum, your eyes will widen and smiles will arrive like a thousand chuckling sunrises! A masterpiece of reverence for life and community spirit has been scripted here and, as is clear from the fact that he doesn't play Wong Fei-Hung (the master), Jet Li clearly demonstrates his accord with the spiritual values offered by the infinitely disciplined, fully loving immortal heart of martial arts!",1033430400,13,5756,4.9411764705882355

736189,4,630395331X,"Some people had strong criticisms of this film. I thought the film was entertaining though. Yeah sure, I'd agree that there was no wire work, and that the fight scenes wern't quite as spectaculor as his more recent films. But that dosn't make it a bad film.
It's set in the late eighties and in LA. Why should it have wire work? It wouldn't fit. The fight scenes are filmed fairly well and look down to earth. The plot is fun and quite humourous. Especially Jet Li's American counterparts. Jet Li is his usually respectable self looking out for the under dogs.
There's a skilled American villan, Jonny, with a signature late eighties hair cut. He does a good job of playing the over confident jerk. (similar to the cocky kid in the Karate Kid) There's several confrontations between Jet's crew and Jonny's student lackies until the finale at the end.
In the end this film should be viewed as a fun down to earth Kung Fu flick. It wasn't meant to be the next kung fu master piece. If watched in the right light it should be a fun and familiar(if from the US and LA in particular) addition to your Jet Li collection.",1030924800,4,1114,4.439024390243903

736191,2,630395331X,"For me, the reason why this video gets two stars at all is due to the aerobic section led by Tracy York.  I have only tried it once so far, but after reading everyone else's reviews of her after doing the tape once, I figured I was just as qualified.  Tracy York is a wonderful aerobic instructor.  I love her in the ESPN Fitness Pros series and was looking forward to this workout.  It is true that she goes through the movements too quickly and that the first time you do the workout, you are not likely to get one (a workout).  BUT...towards the end of the tape I was getting it and I could see that once I DID master the moves, that it could be rather intense (it's all what you put into it).  Her moves are fresh, not recycled from a hundred other fitness videos, which in turn make them complicated and fun.
Billy Blanks on the other hand.....  I was really disappointed in Crunch.  Some of the exercises he does are new, but then he sacrifices form for speed.  Also, he has little input on what size weight you should use for each new exercise.  The beginning of the class is a mess.  He tells the class what to do, but doesn't seem to think that he should join in, with the resultant being that the timing is off for the first exercise.  Then...everyone looks fake.  For me, an exercise video should inspire.... as in: if you workout you could look like this.  Most of these women gained their bodies in a doctor's office, which is probably why they feel the need to whoop and holler every second during the video (pulling stiches out?).  I think the next time I do this video I'll turn OFF the sound and determine my own speed.  While there are some good points to this video (new exercises, Tracy York), there are so many better ones out there.....so don't waste your money.",1018310400,,1784,4.328313253012048

The only lower body excercise was a couple of squats.  There were fake breasts all over the tape, and when it was over I felt like I had wasted 30 min of my life.  I had to do 2 more tapes after this one just to feel like I got a workout at all.  very disappointing Billy! p.s. fat blaster plus was 30 min of floor aerobics. ok, some fun moves, but nothing special.",1017705600,,651,4.086614173228346

The background hooping and hollering is annoying, not to mention distracting. Billy Blanks offers suggestions on how your form should and should not look at exactly the same time when the camera is panning on one of the background exercisers. Plus, he likes to flex his muscles and say ""don't you want to look like this""? Blanks focuses only on the upper body. He only does one lower body exercise. The stretches are uninspiring. He gives little or no direction and periodically he likes to ask - how do you feel? The few times I have used the tape - I respond: ""Cheated!!!!""
The Tracy York portion I have used once. While she tries to offer instructions, they are shotty at best.

7856425,4,630395331X,"Jet Li, clearly on the low point of his career after Born to Defense, starred in this fish out of water martial arts movie in 1989, only to have the thing not released til 1992 after Once Upon a Time in China and Swordsman II came out. Tsui Hark also directed it, but it's hard to tell, because it's not the same competent directing as Once Upon a Time, but rather the rather cheap B-grade HK action directing you'd expect out of someone else.
Jet Li plays the Marital arts student of Yuen Wah (Playing against type, since Wah had a habit of playing nasty bad guys, like in the same year he played the utter monster bad guy in Iceman Cometh. Played the nasty bad guy gangster in Dragons Forever, and was Panther in Police Story 3 Supercop, one of Chaibat's thugs and the one of the vampires in Mr. Vampire.), who travels to Los Angeles to visit his former master and finds that his shop has been trashed and his Master has disappeared into hiding somewhere. Li's Master was defeated by scumbag former student and mullet-head Johnny played with gusto by Jerry Trimble who also in the process destroys his shop.

What ensues is a rather weird version of Way of the Dragon and a proto-Rumble in the Bronx. Li goes around getting into trouble with gangs,bad Taxi Drivers and not being able to understand English or speak it. Finally they settle in the revenge against former student and gigantic ham Johnny plotline with the help of a gang of Hispanic toughs that aren't exactly politically correct, Crystal Kwok and somewhat Anne Rickets.
Yes the fights aren't as good as some of the later ones Jet would produce during the 90s, but the whole movie is rather fun, if not a B-Movie, very cheap looking, though it looks like it was actually filmed in Los Angeles. The language track is rather different than usual, as half of it is in English or to say, dubbed over English. The result is rather cartoonish with the English voices being ridiculously done, the rest of the dialogue is yes in the native language of Cantonese, though Jet was probably speaking Mandarin on the set, and again, he's dubbed by someone else.

Jerry Trimble is the funniest of the group as he alternates between a Cantonese dubbed voice and a English dubbed voice, both ridiculous. As the Cantonese voice is way too deep for this guy to have.

Miramax/Dimension, bought The Master up and trimmed a lot of scenes out of it and English dubbed it to the nines, though there was still the phone gag featuring different languages was apparently trying to keep the original cut's feel of lost in translation, but failing miserably at it. Yuen Wah and Jet Li repeatedly say they don't really know English in the Miramax Dub, but then proves themselves wrong a minute later in a scene.  It was a typical Weinstein hack and chop and sell job, a obscure 1989/1992 production starring Jet Li, released to the USA as a new movie from the action hero? I'm sure most were not fooled when they watched the movie ultimately. The rather 80s fashions are noticeable, including Rick James haircuts and mullets. The Dub Job is OK I guess, can't match the hilarity of the original track with it's rather outrageous English voices. The rather memorable quote from the Dub is  the awful "" We came here to Throw Down"" line, plus a odd reference about Queen Latifah from the bad guy which sounded out of place considering this is clearly the late 80s. The score is also tampered with, a rather  turgid, late 90s/early 00s Garage Rock band score with some Hip Hop beats put in. This clearly replacing the 80s-sounding score that Yee Tat Lam gave the movie that including a Canto Song during part of the movie that was replaced with Garage Rock band music from some forgotten artist.

The Universe DVD is the not the best option to watch the movie, but it is the only Region Free option. Other, better restored versions are through Region 2, 3 and Japan, but the Universe DVD is easily accessible. If not for the fact it is cropped to Full Screen from it's 1.85:1 aspect ratio. But at least still uncut compared to the Dimension edit that does away with some of the Character scenes and comedy scenes. Anne Rickets's character for instance is gutted basically in the Dimension version.

Not Jet Li's Best, but still a good movie anyway. Though I could understand at the time why the movie was held from release in 1989, this probably would have done Jet no favors at the box office in 1989. Though not quite the disaster many reviewers of the movie online have referred the movie to be.",1446422400,,4530,4.570197044334975
