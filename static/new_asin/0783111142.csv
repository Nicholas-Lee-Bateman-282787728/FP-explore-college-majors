7790088,4,0783111142,"However it may appear to today's viewers, released in 1936, this film produced the same sales figures as The Philadelphia Story with Hepburn and Grant, four years later and more than Road to Singapore which started the Hope-Crosby series. While rating of radio programs in those days were extremely primitive, it is estimated that in his first years on the air (beginning in 1931) half the radio's in America were tuned in to his show. In vaudeville and Ziegfeld follies he was a top performer, and in the early 50's, despite poor health, he emceed a television show (in rotation with others) that occupied the prime time slot for a major network. This was the last of his box office hits with Goldwyn, after which, with one exception, he shared top billing or was a featured not really starring performer.
As can be noted here, and in other films of the era, much of the action slapstick comedy falls rather flat on television. I leave it to the visual experts to explain why. Nevertheless, we get a chance to see the sparkling young Ethel Merman, appearing again with Cantor, at a stage in her career in which she hoped to be a Hollywood Star rather than an occasional visitor.
Cantor does several numbers and carries the comedy load along with a member of his radio show, Harry Einstein, who played the role of Parkyakarkus on air and in the film.(Einstein's children include the comedians Albert Brooks and Bob Einstein (a.k.a. Super Dave Osborne), Some of
 it falls flat for those raised on the fare directed, in much larger part, to an educated audience, but some of it still clicks.
While the score provides good settings for Merman and also for satisfying song/dance numbers, it is not first rank Harold Arlen. He was to do a great deal better a few years later, when he wrote the music for Wizard of Oz.
All-in-all, a good film for movie buffs and sufficiently entertaining to  provide a pleasant 100 minutes viewing.",1420156800,2,1926,4.695266272189349
7790089,3,0783111142,"Long considered the weakest of Cantor's six thirties films for Samuel Goldwyn, it was also the their final team effort. Mediocre though it may be, it still has enough going for it to merit the attention of fans of either Cantor or Ethel Merman. In this big-budgeted 1936 outing, the spineless Eddie Pink (!) is continuously bothered by bullies whiles he runs a handy man shop at Millwood University. A lonely milquetoast, his only protector is the kindly but dense Butch Carson (Gordon Jones). Eddie subscribes via mail order, a character-building course which promises to turn him from a mouse to a man by giving him a forceful personality. Eddie later gets involved with crooks, an amusement park & a vivacious torch singer named Joyce Lennox (Ethel Merman, in fine form)...Based upon a novel by Clarence Buddington Kelland which first appeared in the SATURDAY EVENING POST in 1935, the working titles for this fair comedy were DREAMLAND & SHOOT THE CHUTES. Amazingly, this film cost between 1.5 & 2 million dollars to produce. Goldwyn rented ""The Cyclone Racer"", a roller coaster in Long Beach, Ca. for use in the chase sequences. The role of Copple was originally to have been played by character actor Sam Hardy.  After he died following and emergency operation, William Frawley was borrowed from Paramount.",1045958400,14,1312,4.9908675799086755
