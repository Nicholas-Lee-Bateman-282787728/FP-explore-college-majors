2179304,5,B00069FLAY,Essential for any thinking man over the age of 40 in the United States.,1142035200,5,71,4.142857142857143
2179305,4,B00069FLAY,"I found this presentation of King's speech to be excellently portrayed.  After a brief introduction, about 5 minutes about the civil right's movement and circumstances leading up to the famous march on Washington, the speech is presented in its entirety.  Some of the footage leading up to the speech is emotionally graphic - high pressure fire houses being used on peaceful demonstrators and footage from the aftermath of the Church bombing.

I replaced an old VHS copy of, ""I Have a Dream"" to watch during the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday and enjoy the speech in its entirety whereas other versions merely show clips or portions of it.  The only reason I have not given this DVD five stars is because of the brevity of materials.  The inclusion of other memorable civil rights speeches, including President Kennedy and/or other speakers at the march would have made this DVD even better.  Definately still a good purchase.",1140393600,31,927,4.948387096774193
2179306,5,B00069FLAY,"The electrifying speech that changed the hearts and minds of a bitterly divided nation. When 200,000 civil rights marchers - black and white - gathered at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, they expected to hear strong words from their spiritual leader, Martin Luther King. What they did not expect was a speech of such heartfelt passion and poetic eloquence that it echoes still in our memory. Incredibly powerful!",1106265600,12,434,4.958904109589041
2179307,3,B00069FLAY,"I do not remember seeing the entire length of Dr. King's famous ""I Have A Dream"" speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial nearly forty years ago.  As I was preparing to speak to a group of high schools students in a program titled AVID --- Advancement Via Individual Determination --- I was excited by the thought of seeing Dr. King's speech.  What better example of a leader with an inspiring vision for the future?  What better example of someone who put their skills and experience to their highest and best use to fulfill their dream?  What better example of someone who gave their life to something of value and significance?
Dr. King did not disappoint me.  As I strained to pick out his figure --- nearly lost in a sea of over 300,000 faces crowded beneath the Lincoln Memorial --- I heard the voice that stirred souls to action in tumultuous times.  I heard the cadence, rhythm, and volume of it.  I heard the phrases rising and falling like waves crashing on the shore.  I felt a lump in my throat as I considered the power and importance of the message.
And I wondered if we are already too far removed from this message.  Nearly two generations hence, are we closer to Dr. King's dream?  Does today's generation understand the price paid for its freedom?  Are we cultivating leaders who will rise to the needs of tomorrow?  Leaders of character, integrity, vision, action, teamwork, and service?  This was the example and spirit I sought to inspire those students.
I was, however, disappointed by the quality and integrity of the video.  I was at first surprised to hear Peter Jennings of ABC News narrating the video.  As I watched, it became clear the content of the video was an excerpt from a narrative on the life of Dr. King, yet I could find no credit to Mr. Jennings, ABC News, or other source material.  It ended abruptly as if it had been hastily or carelessly editted.  I found this distracting and disappointing.
If I had an opportunity to select an alternative source for Dr. King's speech, I would select a better one.",1021248000,67,2056,4.604395604395604
2179308,5,B00069FLAY,In many publications this speech was named the number one speech of the 20th Century.  I will not disagree.  I have never been able to see the whole speech until now.  Dr. King's words ring true 37 years later.  Guaranteed to give you chillbumps!  A must for any collection!,949795200,27,274,4.510204081632653
2179309,5,B00069FLAY,"The video begins with a brief look at various 1960's era civil rights protests and the violence that often followed such demonstrations.  Using footage (much of it somewhat raw) shot during the marches and  demonstrations and narrated by Peter Jennings, the montage of video  ""highlights"" of the 1960's civil unrest provides a strong setting  for the showing of MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech at the foot of  the Lincoln Monument.
The video does not show the entire speech, but it  does present enough to gain a good understanding of its content.  Perhaps  the single most important reason to watch the video (as opposed to reading  a text version of the speech) is to witness King's change in tone, demeanor  and style as he reaches the end of the speech.  As he begins to call for  ""letting freedom ring"" he abandons his notes and begins to  seemingly speak extemporaneously, and the passion in his voice begins to  rise.  It is a powerful visual, lost in any textual version.
The video  concludes with a brief explanation of the assassination and memorial  service.",948067200,105,1067,4.806629834254144
2179310,5,B00069FLAY,the power of mr king's words are timeless.they have shaped and influenced the world.it's a shame that to often only the excerpts of the speech are ever broadcast.the whole speech needs and deserves to be heard.the man had  a vision for a better future for all.he has left a life lasting impression  on me.this video is history and will last thru the end of all time.a must  have for all people that respect human life.,947289600,13,418,4.546666666666667

Their reply...YES his dreamcame true!!!  I said how did his dream come true???? We have a black president now!  I just looked at my students and said wow, wow!!!!",1359676800,,603,4.4363636363636365

It is not set up very well, you cannot turn on the video and jump right to it, there is not a really well done title menu.

2179350,3,B00069FLAY,"I agree that the I Have A Dream speech was one of Dr. King's finest orations, although many will argue that it was not his greatest speech ever. The supplemental footage which shows the preparations for the march, as well as the events of that historic day, is incredible to watch and hear. It really puts you in the crowd on that hot August day in 1963. Unfortunately, the worst part of the video is the actual I have a Dream speech itself; not because of the speech...but the quality of the footage used to present it. What you have is a kinescope of the television broadcast. A kinescope recording is a motion picture recording of a television image, achieved either by aiming a film camera at a television monitor or using the telecine transfer method. The bottom line is that it's an inferior quality image both in terms of visual and audio quality. The speech was recorded on videotape at the time by the three networks and that tape still exists today with superb video and audio quality. Why that wasn't used as the source material for this video is confusing, as it would have looked like a live TV broadcast, although in black and white.",1265068800,3,1147,4.545893719806763

2179353,1,B00069FLAY,"I felt short changed, expected all the events that lead up to the monumental speech, including Dr. King's speech that day.

2179354,4,B00069FLAY,"I was looking for just the speech and found it.

We played it on MLK Day and it really moved a lot of people (again).",1203292800,3,253,4.142857142857143
2179355,5,B00069FLAY,"Set amidst the backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr. gave the speech that changed the social dynamic of America.  I Have A Dream, he repeated between refrains of equality and social justice.  From that speech erupted a movement - his dream become their dream and now it's our dream and closer to reality than ever before.

I've heard the speech before, and I've read the speech, but seeing it in its setting was a challenge to our basic institutions.  It was a challenge to Lincoln himself.  A challenge in oration, a challenge in tone, and a challenge to change America more

Peter Jennings narrates the dvd and it incorporates raw footage from marches and protests and concludes with a tribute to the man, murdered for his beliefs.  Three hundred thousand people stood before Dr. King that Summer day in 1963 but that's only a fraction of a fraction of those who have been touched by his powerful cadence.  It's both poetry and sermon.  I'm better for having watched it.

This is a speech that is so magical it can be listened to and watched over and over again - never loosing its magic and yet is now seen so rarely.
I purchased it to screen to an undergraduate college class in Architecture - to demonstrate the power of location. Even these students who are used to fast action spectacle were moved by its power.
As many people in our country today, may of them knew only a short clip from Martin Luther King's magnificent speech and never knew how rich and wonderful it is in its entirety with the powerful video recording of the amazing number of people who gathered for the momentous event in our Nation's Capital in front with a back drop of the Lincoln Memorial.",1190937600,,910,4.390532544378698

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's speech - I Have A Dream was well received and many of the participants left the session with a renewed sense of appreciation for the role he played in bringing the nation together.  You could tell his message came from his heart as he rarely looked down at his written speech.  This gentle man touched the hearts of many then - and he continues to make an impact today. What a comparison it was to hear Dr. King's speech and then to hear Jesse Jackson's speech 20 years later.  I would strongly recommend this movie.,1173744000,,638,4.619469026548672
