8671118,5,B00MAD44IO,"I am currently in the two week wait.. and I love this DVD. It is SO unique and different from everything else out there. As a doula I will be recommending this video to all pregnant women I come across because it creates so much space in the pelvis and releases all of the deep hip, pelvic, and back muscles so necessary for birth, while also working the shoulders and upper body (a nice surprise!). I didn't know what to expect when I purchased it because at the time there were only 3 reviews and as an American I was unfamiliar with Birthlight. I'm so glad I took the risk! Even if I do not get my BFP this cycle I will be continuing with this video as it is just so different and effective! This DVD is all about movement and flowing and as Francoise says in the Intro (Watch the intro! Seriously! Especially if you are unfamiliar with birth and/or want to learn about the time-honored Amazonian women traditions which inspire the movements)- the movements are deceptively simple. I was not expecting to get a bit dewey, was not expecting to end the video both energized and centered and was certainly not expecting to walk away feeling like my muscles really worked, but WOW. I also really, really love the meditation bonus section (the breathing techniques will be fantastic for labor) and am looking forward to watching the other bonuses, particularly the postnatal part. This is definitely a video I will be able to enjoy in every trimester! It does move a tad quickly, so be patient with yourself the first few times you watch it as you find your rhythm and become accustomed to the very unique moves and poses. Let the body open slowly and enjoy!

I LOVE this DVD!",1475452800,4,1674,4.506578947368421

It moves a little fast for me in the video (not too fast to follow along, I just don't feel I can move that fast physically). I feel much more relaxed afterwards and clear-headed, yet still feel like I've had a workout. It seems to put the baby to sleep too. I think the yoga positions help to keep the baby head down as well. He is head down now but before it felt like he was turning transverse which was uncomfortable. After the yoga, he would be back head-down.  .",1466553600,,559,4.036036036036036
