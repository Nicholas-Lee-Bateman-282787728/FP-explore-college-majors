8152769,5,B000JSDMNA,"There is now a wealth of scientific data to show that the practice of tai chi - or, more correctly, T'ai chi ch'uan - can produce impressive improvements in both physical and psychological health and most regular practitioners will attest to its impact on their sense of peace and vitality. Naturally enough, the key to obtaining the benefits is practicing correctly.

I have had the privilege of working with a number of tai chi teachers around the world, seven of whom have really had a major impact on me. One of them is John Loupos, who has written and produced this extremely fine DVD. It is more than ten years ago that I was able to do a one-week intensive with John, but the clarity and simplicity of his approach is still fresh in my mind.

This DVD captures the best of John's teachings. He particularly emphasizes the importance correct posture, rooting, breathing and flow. These are principles that can be applied whatever form of tai chi you practice. There is a full demonstration of the yang style tai chi form as well as over fifty scene selections. The whole DVD runs for over two and a half hours, and is excellent value for money. And for people for whom English is not a first language, there are also Spanish and German subtitles.

There is always going to be a limit to how much you can learn without the individual guidance of an experienced teacher, but for people who do not have ready access to a teacher this is quite simply the best DVD on tai chi that I know of. And if you are already working with a teacher, John gives a great many pointers that can really help to move you to the next level.

Very highly recommended.

read my other reviews. i don't pull punches when it comes to criticism. but this video is truly one of the best instructional DVD's out there. his explanations and corrections are better than any in-person instructor i've ever met. his movements are flawless, and yet not too rigid. he's very thorough and clear as he breaks down the first 17 movements of the yang long form.

i only wish that he would make a video of the ENTIRE long form. i have no doubt that it would be the best on the market.

people really need to find out about this guy. i'm a qigong instructor in california, and i'm thinking of traveling to the east coast to study with him for a while. he's that good!",1215302400,3,761,4.3076923076923075
8152771,5,B000JSDMNA,"I haven't finished reading this book yet, but it is very readable and I am learning a lot from it.
I purchased the book because I liked the DVD so much.  I take Tai chi classes and though his
techniques are a little different, what he says is applicable to all forms.  I love listening to him
and find him very inspiring, thus the purchase of the book.  I wish I lived in Mass. to take his
classes...watching and reading have helped me in my practice.",1194480000,2,451,4.22093023255814
8152772,5,B000JSDMNA,"Over the past twelve years, I have tried to learn Tai Chi by using several different video lessons, however, ""Tai Chi Connections"" by Sifu John Loupos is the only one I have found that fully explains how to execute the positions. Each movement is shown from different angles, and Sifu Loupos illustrates the small subtleties needed to do each movement correctly and how to make any necessary revisions. Although Sifu Loupos has been a well-respected Tai Chi Master for many years, he sets a light, enjoyable tone for the DVD, which makes learning very fun.",1167696000,17,556,4.863157894736842
