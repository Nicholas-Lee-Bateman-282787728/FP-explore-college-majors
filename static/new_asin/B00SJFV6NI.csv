6989801,1,B00SJFV6NI,"Pokemon Jynx is in two of the episodes in this season. Both of the two episodes was removed. Only because pokemon Jynx is accuse of being racism. They even removed Holiday Hi-Jynx from Indigo League set as well.
Pokemon Jynx is one of my favorite character and still is.
When I first saw the episode of Jynx blackface wasn't even the first thing that came to mind.
Now truly if Jynx was racism I wouldn't watch it and I wouldn't be complaining about the episodes being removed.
But Pokemon Jynx not racism to me. Not even close to what racism really is.",1431993600,19,553,4.431372549019608
6989802,2,B00SJFV6NI,"As other reviewers have mentioned, there are episodes inexplicably missing from this set. Besides that, the set itself is pretty bare bones. Nothing fancy, no episode guide, English only, just three discs in a case. Subtitles are included.

The set called ""Adventures *on* the Orange Islands"" supposedly contains those episodes missing from this set. For about the same price, there's no reason to get an incomplete set.",1431475200,4,420,5.268656716417911
6989803,1,B00SJFV6NI,"Viz does it again! Terrible Pokemon DVD release #1007!

As the other review on here states, this re-release is indeed missing 2 episodes from the original 2002-2003/2008 releases. Both of the Jynx episodes are now gone and lazily edited out of this DVD set. There is a gigantic gap between episodes on the episode menu selection page. But wait... that isn't even all! These are the EXACT same discs as released in 2002, 2003 and 2008! Viz was so lazy that they pretty much just colored the episodes out from the menu and acted like they don't even exist... yet they left a giant gap where the episodes used to be so that it is totally obvious something is missing. Even the children fans could figure this one out, Viz Media.

There is no episode insert to let you know what episodes are on each disc just like how the Indigo League re-release is missing them as well, same can be said for the Jynx episodes on that set but that's another story. Disc 1 has the opening them once at the very beginning and never again, same for the ending theme at the end of the disc.

Lazy and ridiculous release, Viz. Just stick with your single volumes or the original 2008 box set Adventures ""ON"" the Orange Islands, not ""In"". There is no point in buying this release, it isn't even really cheaper. The 2008 box set is only $3 dollars more than this one at the time of writing.",1430956800,9,1364,4.404761904761905
6989804,2,B00SJFV6NI,"This is review is mainly on the content, not the quality of the DVDs.

First of all, there is no insert to show you how many or which episodes are included. That information is also not made available on the front or back cover of the DVD set. You'd think that would be a minor issue, but this is a rather important problem as this leads to my next and very important issue.

This set is missing 2 episodes and therefore only includes 34 out of the original 36 episodes of Orange Islands. The two missing episodes are Episode 89: Stage Fight! and Episode 98: The Mandarin Island Miss Match. I am not sure if this is due to some controversy as same as how Holiday Hi-Jynx is missing from Indigo League Complete Collection, but this definitely an issue for those of us trying to collect the entire series/season. If you can find the 2009 release, I believe that set does include both of these episodes which makes me wonder why they were removed to begin with.

In case you are wondering, here are the episodes included:

6989851,3,B00SJFV6NI,"Cramming 34 episodes on 3 discs is no easy task. (There would be 36 if the two episodes with Jinx weren't banned because of supposed racism in the design). How did they cram 11-12 episodes on each disc? Well, they only have the Pokemon theme song before the first episode, or you can go and select it from the menu if you want to watch it separately. That saves some space. And they also downgraded the quality just a tiny bit since the Indigo League DVD sets. It's certainly not awful. But since the Indigo League picture quality wasn't the greatest to begin with, this is a little disappointing. Even so, it's certainly watchable and there isn't too much shaking between frames. It's just a tiny downgrade in resolution. If it was more expensive, I probably wouldn't pay for it, but at roughly 10 dollars for 36 episodes? It's worth the price for me.

On the plus side, the menus look cool, with each episode title showing up over whichever island it takes place on. I also saw people complaining that they received scratched discs, but my discs were pristine and flawless and play perfectly. Maybe some of the first copies recycled discs from the old release, and they got scratched in the process of switching cases or removing the two banned episodes? But that's only speculation. Whatever the case, my discs were perfect and if yours aren't, ask Amazon for a replacement.",1516320000,4,1377,4.666666666666667

6989949,3,B00SJFV6NI,"Like many other folks, my son and I got into Pokemon Go this summer- which led to an interest in the Pokemon franchise as a whole. Lucky for us, Amazon and Netflix have the entire 52 episode 1st season (Indigo League) available via streaming.  We fell in LOVE with the Pokemon cartoon series. Smart, silly, tounge-in-cheek, poignant, funny.... it has it all!!! (And this review is more a comment on the dvds themselves, not the content)

So when I purchased the season 2 dvds (Adventures in the Orange Islands), imagine our surprise when we sat down to watch episode #53 and they were talking about things we hadn't seen... what the heck? So, after pulling up the episode list on pokemon.com, we discovered we were watching episode #79 (or as they list it, #27 of season 2).

It turns out that the Indigo League season on DVD is 78 episodes long. And although this set still includes 50 episodes, it starts in the middle of ""season 2"" and spills into ""season 3"" (as per pokemon.com).

We had to buy the third set of Indigo League to get our missing episodes, which is fine.... just wish I had known beforehand. So this is just a **heads-up** to fellow pokemon lovers ",1473120000,31,1167,4.564593301435407

6989991,5,B00SJFV6NI,"Adventures in the Orange Islands is the continuation of Ash's Pokemon journey following the Indigo League.  As for the show itself, if you loved the Indigo League, you'll love Adventures in the Orange Islands.

As for the DVDs, there are three total all in one case.  The quality is fine, and I haven't noticed any problems at all.  There is a lot to watch if you are someone like me who could sit and watch this for hours on end.

There is some criticism due to the fact that there are two episodes featuring Jynx missing from the set.  Although I do not agree that they should have been removed (as I do not believe the appearance of Jynx had any racial meaning at all), the show does not feel like it is missing anything or there is an interruption in the journey.  Like many others, I would much rather have a complete set, but this is more than sufficient for the typical Pokemon lover.  My biggest concern was that the show would feel inconsistent, but it progresses fine.

Additionally, the price is amazing.  I love the convenience of the set and the fact that I don't have to hunt down the whole season piece by piece.

6990037,5,B00SJFV6NI,"Everyone here keeps saying its so bad because its missing like 2 episodes. Well, if you're a Pokemon fan regardless, this is the item for you. Amazing quality and came really fast. It doesn't play the opening or ending song on every episode like it normally does, which is fine since I skip them anyway. All in all, as someone who aspires to own all the Pokemon box sets, this is a great addition to my collection. Plus you cant beat the price!!",1443657600,3,445,4.373493975903615
6990038,5,B00SJFV6NI,It was great to see ash and the group took me back to when grand kids were little . i had taped them from the t.v. series back in the 90's i bought these for my first new great  grand son to watch with his dad some day. if any parts were missing i still have on tape and can put on a dvd .i thought these were a lot better than vhs tapes so i was very pleased.,1443398400,,360,3.5569620253164556

Can't people understand this rerelease is GOOD for the dvds in America,Complete seasons,naysayers will ALWAYS find a nitpick,As stated before,The Poke'mon Company or whoever decides what to do overseas,Vis simply RETAILS the episodes stateside. I want these ""Complete Collections"" for one,I want all the way through Advanced last season. Hope this gets you to buy it,it is in a good case,like Sailor Moon dvds.",1433376000,2,415,5.4
6990041,1,B00SJFV6NI,"This is not a complete set, it is missing two episodes that merely CAMEO Jynx, Not focus on like with ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"", that one I can kinda understand with Jynx sorta looking like a slave for Santa Claus to the untrained eye and the close-minded. These two episodes ""Stage Fight"" and ""The Mandarin Island Mismatch"" only have Jynx appear in her original Ganguro (not blackface, there's a difference) for only a couple of SECONDS. Seriously? Is a brief cameo by a Pokmon that isn't that important to the plot that offensive to you close minded types? That woman who claimed Mr. Popo from Dragon Ball Z was a blackface slave back in the 90s doesn't know what she's talking about at all. Yeah, they are basically filler episodes, as is most of the Orange Islands, but it's still one of the better paced arcs of Pokmon's franchise and enjoyable in its own right. And regardless of specifics, I EXPECT there to be all of the episodes on a DVD set that says ""Complete Collection"". Bottom line: Just buy the original boxset for $4-5 more while it's still in print.",1433030400,2,1058,4.603174603174603
6990042,1,B00SJFV6NI,"Missing Episodes are a disappointment. If you are going to take episodes out there it is NOT acceptable to then call your set the ""Complete Collection"" If you took things out it simply is not complete. In addition if you are going to take things out the menus should atleast be redone to cover it up. There are blaring gaps in the menus where the 2 missing episodes *should* have been Which would make it apparent even to a child that what you have got here is *not* complete. Disappointing.",1432944000,4,491,4.466666666666667
6990043,1,B00SJFV6NI,"You do not want to buy this re-release!

But the 2009 release where it says ""36 episodes of tropical Pokmon adventures on 3 discs"" at the top of the case and NOT this version where it says ""Complete Collection"" on the bottom.

This set is NOT complete as it's missing two episodes ""Stage Fright"" and ""The Mandarin Island Miss-Match"" due to both episodes having Jynx in these episodes and much like ""Holiday Hi-Jynx"" in the 3rd Pokmon Indigo League volume, those episodes were before Jynx had her face colour changed from black to purple. They apparently fixed this in Japan with digital methods, but sadly Viz has not decided to use those versions and simply insert the dub into those episodes. They may make up for that with a 3 disc volume featuring those illusive episodes, but that's not on the horizon yet.

So avoid this release if you want to have all the episodes and let Viz know fans won't stand for it!",1432944000,,913,4.554878048780488
6990044,4,B00SJFV6NI,"""Episodes are missing""
Yes, it's true that Stage Fight and Mandarin Island Miss Match aren't in this, but that wasn't Viz's decision; it was Nintendo of America's.

""They reused the old discs/the menus have typos""
I don't really mind the typos, because at least the box got the name of the season right. Do you ever consider the glass half-FULL? I doubt it.

""The quality sucks""
I looked through the episodes myself, and compared with the Indigo League Complete Collection. The quality is the same between both box sets. In other words, the video quality is AMAZING. Maybe it sucks with the older box sets, but not with this one.

Conclusion
We asked for an Orange Islands reprint, and this is exactly what we asked for. If NOA wants to forget about the Jynx episodes ever existing, then think of it this way: when Viz reprints the Johto episodes (they already said they were going to), they won't leave out any more Jynx episodes because 4kids already took care of that. This box set lives up to my expectations, and I am happy. My only complaint, though, is that even with the banned episodes, the season itself isn't very long. To be frank, it's more of a filler season, if that makes sense. Whatever, so long as it's Pokemon.",1432684800,2,1229,4.602739726027397
