7952015,5,B00005R2CD,"Oooh, what a stinker this one is. I found this in a bin full of Christmas movies back in the '90s, in a Lowe's Home Improvement store of all places. Since it clearly wasn't a Christmas film and looked horrible (and only cost about fifty cents) I bought it. And didn't regret it. And subsequently lost it. Finally tonight, after all these years I remembered the name.

Other reviewers say this film looks like a home movie. If memory serves it was shot with home video cameras in North Carolina. I seem to remember absolutely NO redeeming qualities to this film whatsoever, but in that fantastic way that some bad movies have it's extremely entertaining. The single most cringeworthy film I've ever seen. And for some reason the print I had stopped before the end of the film and went into a COMPLETELY unrelated episode of The Andy Griffith Show! And it wasn't a case of the tape being adulterated by accident as the world famous Griffith show theme song had been replaced by a completely different version! One of the oddest films I've ever seen. If you collect strange films this one MUST be in your collection. Now, I just have to find a working VHS machine!",1479600000,,1161,4.581730769230769

7952017,3,B00005R2CD,"Product arrived quickly. Movie played well, not best quality, but happy for what I payed. Love'd this movie when i was a kid, glad to see they had it at such a low price.",1362528000,,170,4.029411764705882
7952018,5,B00005R2CD,"WOW!! is all I can say about this movie.  Sure, it may lack a bit in the professional movie-making arena, but it is a wonderful story.  You see the world through the eyes of Nacho, the adorable ""chi-wa-wa"", as he returns to his home ""South of the Border"" to find his love, El Nina.  When Nacho encounters the farm animals on his journey, I was laughing so hard.  And the ending...oh the ending.  Like a previous reviewer noted, the movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry...sometimes both at the same time.  I wish the distributer would release it on DVD....",1224028800,,566,4.446601941747573
7952019,1,B00005R2CD,"Being we own a chihuahua, we were really looking forward to seeing Nacho.  However, about 5 minutes into the movie, we knew that we had wasted our money.  The plot was stupid and boring.  The film quality resembled something that a child did with his Christmas Present: A toy video camera.  The human actors had little talent.  Even more disappointing were the voiceovers of Nacho and El Nina; not only did the voices not sound Mexican at all, you couldn't tell what country they were from.  Even my children were hating it.  I have to say it was the worst movie I ever saw.  Bad dog.",1108857600,4,584,4.443396226415095
7952020,5,B00005R2CD,"nacho chihuahua must have been the greatest movie that i have EVER seen. there was action, adventure, romance, not to mention the *original* song, ""Don't Cry for Maria, El Nia"". And plus! the amazing plot twist at the end. i recommend this movie for ANYBODY who is a somebody.
ole!
and remember how it goes,

7952021,5,B00005R2CD,"i don't know what is wrong...maybe you didn't quite make it to the surprise ending. i loved this movie. its even funnier, if you make sure that you watch the video all the way through, don't turn it off when the credits come on. my only disappointment was that at no point in the movie does nacho wear the hat...the rest was hilarious.",1030233600,3,335,4.333333333333333
7952022,1,B00005R2CD,"I first heard of this movie when I saw it up for auction at eBay, and wondered why I hadn't heard of it before, seeing as I am always looking for family movies and Chihuahua items both. But after one veiwing, I now know why! This is obviously a home video recorded by someone with too much time on his hands who somehow managed to get it packaged up nicely and marketed. With only a handful of actors, none of whom can talk in anything other than a monotone, and shaky film footage, I can't imagine how this ever got into production. I doubt that it would hold even a small child's interest. A serious waste of time.",1022976000,3,616,4.228813559322034
7952023,1,B00005R2CD,"Unless you really love Chihuahuas,don't rush to buy this. The packaging is professional and that's the only thing. The video has a very home-made quality, and is not entertaining enough for anyone over the age of two. I love Chi's and still felt embarrassed for this movie. They should remake this movie and hire some writers and actors. And at no time in the movie does a dog wear a sombrero. Very disappointing movie.",1021939200,2,419,4.675675675675675
