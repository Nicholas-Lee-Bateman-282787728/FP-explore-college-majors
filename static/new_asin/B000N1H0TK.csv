8173887,5,B000N1H0TK,"I cast this production with my company SWAT4HIRE and purchased this because the only copies I have are Production Company ""reels"" on VHS.
I've never been more proud of the talent than on this production.
I'm biased. But I love this series, the cast, the crew and the memories.
I'd recommend it to anyone looking for reality based productions that were starring real tactical personnel using real tactics (or as close as possible) instead of background actors & extras.
Fun job!",1407024000,,477,4.901234567901234

""The following program is based on information provided by the United States Government and events reported in the news.  The show is a dramatic representation of how covert intelligence activities can support U.S. military forces.  Fictional names and scenarios have been used for national security purposes. The paramilitary officers portrayed are not actual C.I.A. officials.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Discovery Channel has long been THE place to go for insanely cool information about the military.  Before everyone and their grandmother became fans of the Navy SEALs, Discovery aired a program about the botched SEAL airfield attack during Operation Just Cause in Panama. I first read about the tragic operation in both a local newspaper and a book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Warriors/dp/0747513945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Warriors</a>, so when Discovery finally dramatized it in a show, I got my confirmation.  They had interviews with real SEALs from the op, and the details matched what was printed in the other sources; so if it's on Discovery Channel, it HAS to be true, right?  Right?

Over a decade later, enter the events of 9/11 and the show ""Covert Action"".  The episode I saw was called Operation: Field Goal, which was about a lone soldier that infiltrated Afghanistan immediately after the WTC attacks.  What's so strange is that I swear the original show stated he was a Special Forces Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO).  This DVD set claims that he was a CIA officer named Mark Wayne Johnson, but the originally aired show gave him an Hispanic name.  That's why I find this set so compelling.  Why the name change?  Did the original show reveal too much information?  This is supposed to be a fictionalized entertainment series, so why the discrepancy?  Maybe it's a legal issue.  I'm not saying there's a cover-up, I'm just asking why are the shows different.

Even if these three episodes (45-50 minutes each) are fictional, and the production values laughable, what's implied is so much cooler than anything else out there.  They have interviews with ""military officers"", the very real Michael Jenkins from the Rand Corp., and even  H. Keith Melton, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Spy-Book/dp/0789404435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Spy Book</a>&nbsp;and owner of the largest private collection of historical covert intelligence tools.  Those are some heavy hitters when it comes to covert intelligence, so it seems like a lot of work for a ""fictional"" cable TV special.  From the box set text:

Operation: Rear Echelon.  Follow two paramilitary officers as they risk their lives to set the stage for a US/Allied invasion of Afghanistan....

Operation: Field Goal...a CIA special operations officer...ventures alone into enemy territory....

Operation: Sea Scuttle...join a race against time as US authorities discover a terrorist plot to build a crude nuclear bomb...via cargo ship....

All three episodes are barebones and presented on their own DVD, but it seems like all three could have fit on a single disc.  There are no subtitles or extras.  And the special effects look like they were using 1980s technology.  But what's important is what's implied.  The episode 'Rear Echelon' claims two CIA officers went into Afghanistan to contact the Northern Alliance in order to start the war on terror.  That's easily confirmed in any of the recently authored books about the war.

So are the other two DVDs about real events as well?  Did a lone man infiltrate bad-guy country?  Did the SEALs sink a ship in order to dispose of a nuclear weapon?  I'm just a regular citizen, so I don't need to know the truth about covert operations, but when shows like ""Covert Action"" come out it drives me nuts.  I can't confirm any of the events from the other two discs.  I doubt these shows will ever air again, so I recommend that you buy this set if you're a fan of the military and the brave men and women who sacrifice for our safety and well being.  You can only find this set used now, so I recommend you get it before it disappears, but I suspect you'll walk away with more questions than answers.",1350604800,,4424,5.382823871906841
8173889,4,B000N1H0TK,"A realistic set of 3 DVD's that provide the viewer with a greater sense of the true nature, and the danger of real-life covert operations. Each mission portrays a 'behind-the-scene' aspects of: concept, communications, support, transport, weaponry, and people who execute covert operations. A refreshing look at how real operations are conducted. These are not a Hollywood action flicks, but a real look at how these operations are actually carried-out, and the nature of the men who are engaged in these types of activities.",1178409600,,525,5.261904761904762
