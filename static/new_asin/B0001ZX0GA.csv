Season five contains great stories of ""4 Horseman of the Apocalypse"" and the great Evil that comes every 1,000 years. Of course there will be great commentary interviews and add clips of writers/directors/cast adding background insight about filming the episodes.",1090972800,6,406,5.564516129032258

2047608,4,B0001ZX0GA,"In watching this series 1-5 again after nearly two decades from its original broadcast, I am reminded of its slow descent somewhere between season 4 and 5, and why I never paid attention to it ever playing out a 6th.

There seems to have been many ""what ifs"" with the entire Highlander:The Series project. What if Derek de Lint hadn't backed out of playing the role of Connor MacLeod, originally slated for more than one episode? There is only one Christopher Lambert, but de Lint is a stronger actor and to have played the role of Connor may have added a bit more dimension to the small screen effort. What if Alexandra Vandernoot hadn't wished to leave her role as the artistic and sympathetic Tessa Nol? What if Peter Wingfield had replaced the role of Darius, as originally proposed, left by the terribly premature death of Werner Stocker? What if Methos had been played by a different, perhaps more intense actor? And finally, what if Richie hadn't remained such an immature irritant? If any character was in need of a good stint in a Zen monastery, it was Richie Ryan. For all of Duncan MacLeod's immortal insight, I am surprised it wasn't written in that he didn't insist on it.

The overall character and story development began to crumble after the defection of Ms. Vandernoot and the demise of Werner Stocker. The contrived relationship between the sorrowful Mac and the sanctimonious Doc Lindsey was not only unconvincing, but seemed more an act of desperation for an uninspired writing crew that didn't quite know what to do after the loss of a major supporting role. To have attempted to revive the Duncan/Tessa dynamic with the procedural Anne Lindsey, the very opposite of what MacLeod appeared to find appealing in Tessa, was a waste of story space.  It may have been wiser to replace the grounding role of Darius, lest our handsome hero wander aimlessly.  Methos and Joe the Watcher were unequipped to fill that essential element, although one gets the impression they were intended to.  As much as I was amused by the hyper-active, friends-with-benefits, Amanda, the character's deep rooted narcissism grated after awhile. Still, there were some good, if not great moments and Roger Daltry as the wily Hugh Fitzcairn was always played with priceless precision.

The idea of the dark quickening was intriguing, although it seemed the character of Duncan MacLeod never really recovered from either it or the absence of Tessa, Darius and eventually Fitzcairn. His nearly 400 years of Zen-like reflection turned into a train-wreck of emotional baggage and unrelenting self-recrimination, which culminated into an uncharacteristic, self-righteous egocentrism. Nowhere was this more evident than in ""The Modern Prometheus"" episode. Then again, three consecutive losses of beloved relationships, not to mention MacLeod's own psychotic beheading of his friend, Sean Burns, would make even an immortal lose his otherwise good mojo and eventually kill his own student in a fit of delirium.

Ultimately, Season 4's ""Homeland"" will always be my favorite and looking back (and in revisiting now), seemed to have been the cusp between what was best in the series and what became its steady decline. I must add that ""Dramatic License"" was an insult to the entire series experience, and when watching originally was the episode where I pretty much lost interest in watching further. When I ordered Seasons 1-5, I realized I only vaguely remembered any of them after that particular episode, which, for the sake of self-preservation from affront, skipped over on the disc.

This may be more an analysis than review, but there it is.",1455408000,2,3633,5.033277870216306

2047720,5,B0001ZX0GA,"I have to agree with the other reviewers, this season was by far the strongest of all of them. Nearly every episode was good, even the weaker ones.

We see more of Duncan's past as characters such as Cassandra and Melvin Korin, otherwise known as Kronus (more on him later), reappear in Duncan's life. We see a change in the relationship between Duncan Macleod and Richie Ryan. We find out more about Methos (more on that later too) and we get some new interesting characters!

There were two comedy episodes that I just loved. Both involved Adrian Paul and Elizabeth Gracen. While ""Dramatic License"" was a good one, the duo is even funnier when they have Roger Daltry with them as Hugh Fitzcain in ""The Stone Of Scone.""

Back to Methos and Kronus, they made a huge impact in the Highlander universe when Duncan discovers from his friend/lover Cassandra that Methos was a murderer, rapist, killer, etc. over 5,000 years ago along side Kronus as part of The Four Horsemen in the episodes ""Comes A Horsemen"" and ""Revelations 6:8."" Duncan must now stop this band of immortals while deciding whether or not to kill Methos in order to prevent their evil from walking the earth again!

Personal Note: I hope I am not the only one that feels this way but those two episodes should've been a feature film! Had it had been, it could've rivaled even the original Highlander as the best film of the franchise!

Back to Season 5, the relationship between Duncan and Richie comes to a shocking and tragic end in the final episode called ""Archangel."" The ramifications are felt throughout Season 6.

Overall, this is (in my view) the best season of Highlander! Just for the Horsemen episodes, its worth the money alone and may be the ONLY season I would pay more than $40 for! To quote an earlier reviewer, if you buy only one season of Highlander, this is the one to buy! Highly recommended!",1200614400,2,1878,4.641566265060241
2047721,5,B0001ZX0GA,This is my favorite season of Highlander. I enjoy almost every episode in this set. If you are only going to buy one season buy this one. It seems as if this was the season when everything came together for the Highlander people.,1199232000,,229,4.348837209302325
2047722,4,B0001ZX0GA,"This season probably has the highest number of fantastic episodes. Unfortunately, it has a few real stinkers as well, including the most notorious where the producers betrayed the fans.

* * *

My kids and I just rewatched the entire series. While this season has a few good episodes, it has some real clunkers and doesn't hold up as well.",1188345600,,339,4.633333333333334
2047723,5,B0001ZX0GA,"Without a doubt the best season yet. Season five combines an entirely thrilling set of characters including, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch), Methos (Peter Wingfield), Amanada (Elizabeth Gracen) and Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes) and let's not forget our comic relief character who continually seems to be popping up from the past, Fitzcairn.

The season exceeds the other before (and after) it mostly because of the script. There are some absolutely brilliant lines in a few episodes that just take your breath away. The character of Methos is really devloped in a most astonishingly and heartily genius manner.

The episodes that really got the limelight from me were 'Comes a Horseman' and it's continuiation, 'Revelations 6:8' mainly starring Methos. It's the first time we get flashbacks from his character and it's really an amazingly well done piece of work. The effort both the actor and the writers put into the character is very noticable and very much appreciated. If only Highlander had known that 5,000 year old immortal from season one.

The opening episode of season five introduces a new character to the screen, Cassandra. A 3,000 year old immmortal whom Duncan met in his childhood. She appears once more later on in the season.

A shocking finale to the season involves a heavy plotline involving Richie and Duncan, with Methos and Joe involved as a backset. A menacing evil has appeared and the ancient prophecy, which started up at the beginning of the season, is now being played out. The last episode ends as a cliffhanger making fans rush to buy the last season, num. 6.",1144108800,2,1611,4.977695167286245
2047724,5,B0001ZX0GA,"Following the advice of another reviewer, I went to the official HL website and found they are indeed selling the sets for half of what other retailers are charging. However - caveat emptor - the Season 5 set that the HL Store sent me has 8 discs, not 9, and seems to be missing two vital (to me, anyway) bonus features - ""Peter Wingfield: The Man Who Became Methos"" and ""The Time of the Gathering: Highlander's 1998 Convention"" (which I attended). After getting no response to two separate emails, I took time out of my workday to call the HL Store (they only answer the phone 8:30-5 PST, M-F). The operator I talked to said that the sets they have are the ""European"" versions of the sets, but they're the same as Anchor Bay's sets. When I told her this wasn't the case, we both took our computers online to Sam Goody, which lists the bonus features (why is Amazon not doing that for Season 5, anyway?). Because her computer was glitching, she asked me to print out the webpage that listed the bonus features and fax it to her. That was the last I heard, and - quite frankly - I don't know if they're planning to do anything about it besides say, ""Oh, well."" Perhaps I should call again... The practical upshot of all this is, if Methos and/or the 1998 convention hold any importance to you (and who doesn't hold Methos as important?), be careful about buying Season 5 at the Highlander site.",1115251200,13,1393,4.4453125

I often watch TV late at night and don't like to have the volume very loud, as I don't live alone.  The subtitle feature has been a blessing for me when watching movies and other TV shows on DVD.  I didn't start my Highlander collection until Season 5 was released, so I am not very optimistic that the other season sets are going to be different.  I will still get all 6 seasons but are not going to rave about them.  I also didn't like the packaging.  Who wants to have to remove one disc to get to another?  I will probably have to keep my Highlander DVDs in a CD wallet to make it more convenient.",1114387200,3,708,4.124087591240876
2047746,5,B0001ZX0GA,"Many fans consider this season to be the last true season of ""Highlander"" before the series spiraled towards oblivion with season six.  Many fans also consider this to be the show's best season.  No matter what you say, it's indisputable that the fifth season holds some of the show's finest episodes.

One of the lesser points of the show's later years was that it delved deeper into the realm of fantasy, bringing in witches and even a Zoroastrian space demon (!).  Season five begins with one such episode, entitled ""Prophecy"", which introduced the character of Cassandra (played by Tracy Scoggins), a five-hundred-year-old witch whom MacLeod briefly met as a child.  We explore the after-effects of MacLeod's Dark Quickening (from the season four episode ""Something Wicked"") in ""The End of Innocence"", a great episode that shows Richie's loss of trust in Duncan.  Carl Robinson, the character from season two's ""Run For Your Life"", returns in ""Manhunt"" (as well as a young Eric McCormack), while - naturally - Amanda returns for many an episode.  The high point of the season is undoubtedly the two-parter which delved into Methos' dark past, beginning with ""Comes a Horseman"" and ending with ""Revelation 6:8"".  These two episodes are often thought to be the best of the whole show, and I must say I agree.  These are just a few of the great episodes in this season, which also includes the entirely flashback episode ""Stone of Scone"", as well as the beautiful ""Duende"", and intriguing ""Modern Prometheus"".  We're left with a cliffhanger for the season - ""Archangel"", the first of the Ahriman trilogy, which forsees the coming of a space demon whom Duncan alone can defeat.  If it sounds horrible, it's because it is.

One of the best parts of season five is not simply the jump forwards in script quality, but the evolution of the characters.  They seem much more three-dimensional in this season, and are also placed in difficult situations which makes us think, ""What would I do in this situation?""

Of course, the real reason to love this season is the many appearances of Methos.  (Wink wink.)

If you were introduced to the show through the DVDs, you're in for a real treat with this season.  For you longtime ""Highlander"" fans out there, sit back and enjoy what may be the best season of the entire show.",1107993600,31,2315,4.849872773536895

Season Five is no exception and contains the same unique special features and great video transfer as the rest.

It doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the series or the special features which were enough in the first two seasons two make me buy the rest, at a premium for my impatience, from the official site ([...]

As in the previous season, Highlander season 5 begins with a tale of Duncan's childhood. Through present day events and flashbacks, "" Prophecy"" shows us a whole new breed of older immortal with powers that certainly would have helped the character of Methos (Peter Wingfield) in earlier seasons, mind control over humans and younger immortals through a powerful form of hypnotic suggestion. We are introduced to the character of Casandra, the first immortal that Duncan (Adrian Paul) ever came into contact with as a child and a fabled witch in his native village. ""Prophecy"" as befits its title foreshadows the entire season we later find, even to the point of making minor mention of Connor MacLeod, Duncan's distant cousin and the hero of the original Highlander movie. While some may not see the referencing of the original movie for the first time since the pilot for the series as foreshadowing, to me it stands as a statement from the producers that all bets are off.

It is easy to forget that there is now a ""chosen one"" prophecy hanging over Duncan's head as you get into the season. After his failed attempt to kill Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch) during his ""Dark Quickening"" (the ""good guy gone evil through no fault of his own"" scenario of the previous season), Duncan must make amends with his former pupil or push him away. Relations are still strained with Joe Dawson, his former Watcher now friend and Methos shows up in enough episodes this season that the producers must have been thinking spin-off.

The penultimate season of Highlander has the usual mix of comedic episodes interspersed with the serious. Highlights of the lighter episodes include the return of Roger Daltrey as Hugh Fitzcairn in an entirely ""historical"" episode entitled ""The Stone of Scone"" and a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" style romp with the spin-off character Amanda (Elisabeth Gracen) and her former partner Cory Raines (Nicolas Lea) making Duncan's life miserable both in present day and the past in ""Money No Object."" The Funniest moments from the season come from an episode entitled ""Dramatic License"" in which a female author has published a romance novel about Duncan and an exaggerated account of some of his many exploits.

Foreshadowing plays a huge role in this season and the Prophecy that was told in the opening episode starts to come into play in the darker episodes of the season. In ""Comes a Horseman"" and ""Revelation 6:8"" we find that Methos has been hiding an a secret of his ancient and evil past that could end up destroying the world. ""Double Jeopardy"" uses the Highlander master craft of the flashback to reintroduce us to one of the series original and deadliest villains, who may not be dead after all, Xavier St. Cloud (Roland Gift). Finally, ""Archangel"", the finale, introduces the deadliest threat to immortals yet which may very well Satan himself.",1094428800,37,3395,4.868512110726644

2047754,5,B0001ZX0GA,"Season five of Highlander is another great 22 episodes. This season starts off in a similar fashion as season four did. `Prophecy' takes us back to the Highlands of Scotland when Duncan was only 13 years old; we got to see him in close contact with his cousin Robert, with whom he had to confront in season four's opener `Homeland'. This season also brings home Ritchie, now an immortal with no false belief that Duncan will protect him and watch out for him; he is ready to take care of himself. There are episodes with Huge Fitzcairn, played by the great Rodger Daltrey, and Amanda, and Methos. My favorite episodes in the series `Comes a Horseman' and `Revelations 6:8' are in this season, with additional director's cuts versions of both episodes. This season is great enough on its own, but the DVD set comes packed with interviews and deleted scenes. The interviews are long, and most of them are great to watch. The deleted scenes are fun as well; they show with great detail how much work went in to filming the sword fights. This DVD set is well worth the time and the money. I highly recommend this set for all who enjoy great TV; there is enough action, comedy, science fiction, and drama for any fan.",1092528000,14,1212,4.564220183486238
2047755,5,B0001ZX0GA,"I have seasons 1 through 4 on DVD and will get this one as soon as it comes out. It will be a must buy for every Highlander fan as we find out what happens to Richie after the encounter with Duncan following the dark quickening from season 4, and of course the main point from season 5 comes as we learn more and more about the character of Methos and his affiliation with the 4 Horseman. Can't wait 'till this one comes out.",1091318400,7,425,4.071428571428571

8019114,5,B0001ZX0GA,"Highlander was a series a little ahead of its time, it is easy to say that when it is still fresh after it is 20 years old. The stories are usually great, all but the last one which may cause a few tears, it changes the series for the final season of the show, season 6 which has only 13 episodes. The only improvement would be if they also had the movies included in the series, but so far no go.",1481846400,,397,3.9135802469135803

8019116,5,B0001ZX0GA,"I recently bought this to replace my previous copy which had many of the discs scratched up through repeated using-and mis-storing incidents. Season Five is easily one of my favorites of the series particularly the comedic episodes like Money no Object and the Ransome of richard Redstone. Also I love the Modern Prometheus. I wasn't so thrilled with the Killing of Richie Ryan as I felt he was an important piece of audience identification. But moreover I totally disagree with David Abramowitz's reasons for killing Richie ""Because it's Highlander! Not highlander and his lil buddy Richie! This isn't Batman and Robin!""  That being said, I did feel that Richie's death did make sense in the long run, Not because he as a character was expendable, but because Ahriman was more than the average ""Evil Immortal Villain of the week"" Richie's death raised the stakes and truly showed that the Game was of little consequence in comparison to stopping Ahriman. It also showed that No One was safe as long as the demon could manipulate all of these characters into killing each other. There is one thing about the special features. On the last disc it says Exclusive Interviews with the cast and crew both on the package and also the menu. but that is a mis-leading description as it is exclusively  Adrian Paul alone talking about his experience in directing The Modern Prometheus.
The second Blooper Reel is awesome the Duels montage is also a lot of fun to watch.
Peter Winfield The Man who would be Methos is the hidden Gem of the set as I had never watched it before this most recent purchase.",1473292800,2,1592,4.7644927536231885
