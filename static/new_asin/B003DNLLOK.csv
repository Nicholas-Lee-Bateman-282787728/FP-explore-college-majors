8394859,5,B003DNLLOK,Even tough this is just a movie knowing that these young children risked their lives in order to save their little brother is amazing. Not only do they do something this dangerous but they show that children can also fight and kick ass.,1480377600,,236,4.511627906976744

8394861,5,B003DNLLOK,"Okay first off for those who've claimed this film isn't for the ""entire"" family going experience need to be careful about confusing people with their opinions. Some saying that this simply isn't a ""family"" movie should be more specific in the age group that they're referring to. Unless it's the Sesame Street crowd that's being singled out then I see no harm in allowing pre-teens to view this enjoyable good time of a film. Are some of the choreographed fight scenes a little brutal in some ways...yes, but nothing that hasn't been seen before in other PG13 flicks. I like how this film showcases someone (or in this case a group) who isn't your typical ripped muscle guy beating the crap out of every average human mark that gets in the way. I love the family / friendship aspect this film displays throughout the story with it's main protagonists. These kids should have a future in these types of films if not in any type...period. When it comes to the story I've already discussed in other reviews similar to this movie how that's never an important category when it comes to these types of films. The reason why you truly watch is to see if the kicks & punches look good, & in this case they all look damn great. These kids should be called the mini Tony & Jija of their generation. Heck in some ways they might even have an advantage over those two longevity wise just based on their age alone. Only time will tell.",1436918400,,1423,4.51937984496124

8394863,5,B003DNLLOK,"First, what compelled me to get this film was its action director. Panna Rittikrai who's the action director of this film also choreographed Ong Bak trilogy and also Chocolate. Those films, to me, made Panna Rittikrai a bonafine martial arts choreographer in my book. As soon as I discovered he choreographed them film, I knew it was going to be worth a watch.

Now, this film was unbelievable. Not only is the martial arts good but the story is what gets you hooked. The story put more passion into martial arts sequences. It's kind of like Chocolate's story : [another Baa-Ram-Ewe production] dealing with emotional matters of the heart, pun intended,

All in all, this is an amazing film and if you have thirteen bucks to waste, waste it on this gem.",1434585600,,753,4.696969696969697

8394866,5,B003DNLLOK,"The great film with the silly title, Power Kids (original Thai title: 5 Heart Heroes, but also known as Force of Five) is a terrific, action-packed martial arts film produced by the director of Ong-bak and Chocolate - which, if you've seen either of these films means you know what a rollercoaster ride the action sequences in this will be. Kids are the heroes here, as the film opens with a little shrimp of a kid named Wun, who lives with his brother Wut at a Muy Thai school where they have grown close to a few other students, forming a close bond of friendship between all five. Adorable and precocious, all Wun wants to do is be a normal kid - but born with a severe heart condition, the little boy has always had to take things slow, always under the protective eye of his older brother.

When circumstances occur that make Wun even more ill, to the point where a transplant is the only solution or Wun will die, the local hospital seeks frantically around Bangkok for a compatible heart donor - finally locating one at another hospital nearby. But with only four hours to spare, the heart is held up at the hospital - literally - when a band of violent terrorists take over the hospital, taking hostages and threatening to kill any and every person who stands in their way until their demands are met. With Wun so close to death, young Wut and his three friends band together to sneak past the terrorists, retrieve the heart for Wun, and get it back to the hospital before it's too late.

Yeah, the film is pretty obvious in trying to tug at the heartstrings ... but it's also an entertaining, action-packed roller coaster ride that has, at its center, a story of bravery, dedication, and friendship. The kids, while decent actors, are freaking amazing martial artists; there are no ""little people"" stunt doubles here, and these kids can both give and take a hit with real conviction on-screen; you'll be rooting and cheering for Wut and his friends from the very beginning, fairly yelling at the screen for them to kick the total ass of the bad-guy terrorist leader (Johnny Nguyen, coolly evil here).

Sure, the film can be overly sentimental; the plot even a bit far-fetched. But Power Kids is one of those films you'll be completely, emotionally caught up in, that also happens to have a positive message about love and friendship (though definitely not for young children, due to the violence and fight/action sequences). A worthy addition to your DVD library, and also worth repeat viewings just for those way-freaking-cool fight sequences alone!",1327190400,,2559,4.694877505567929
8394867,4,B003DNLLOK,"3 or 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one. Lame title, kind of a cool flick. POWER KIDS, an action film from Thailand, supposes that pre-teen, early teen Muay Thai-fighting children can take on grown-up terrorists and wipe the floor with them. Unlike the Douglas brothers in 3 NINJAS, the kids here actually demonstrate the requisite skills and believability to pull it off. Woon and his older brother Woot attend a Muay Thai school with their friends, so that would explain all the martial arts. But life has saddled young Woon with heart disease, leaving the boy in dire need of a transplant. As Woon's condition worsens drastically, a matching organ surfaces. But then rebel terrorists seize control of the hospital holding the heart. Time for Woon's older brother and his friends to pull a John McClane. The kids spring into action under a deadline of four hours, that being the time limit for the donated heart's liability for a successful transplant.

POWER KIDS isn't polished. It's got plenty of rough around the edges and, really, the film doesn't get going until Johnny Nguyen (from THE REBEL) and his terrorists take over the hospital. Before that, there are scenes which inform the viewer of how much young Woon is cherished by his older brother and his friends. It's frankly a bit too schmaltzy. There's a comedy action bit featuring an Ugly American getting his what handed to him by the children and also a race sequence involving motorized toy cars which serves to expand on one of the kid's background and to then launch the central plot thread. For the action buff, things pick up after that.

Their names are really long, but the kids who play ""Woot"" and ""Cat"" are the two primary kid fighters and they had to train for two to three years before the director thought them prepared enough that they could finally start shooting. And these kids are phenomenal and look convincing with their nifty Muay Thai and the dazzling gymnastics they perform. It's again demonstrated - although these kids aren't at the level of Tony Jaa or Jeeja Yanin - that there is perhaps no more gratifying or more visceral move in martial arts than a fully committed Muay Thai knee applied to the noggin. These kids throw plenty of knees and elbows, and their climactic showdown with Johnny Nguyen is pretty epic.

As unbelievably skilled as Woot and Cat are, I like the fact that it took multiple kicks and elbows and flips from the kids to put down a bad guy and also that a S.W.A.T. unit was key in corralling the bad guys. It's a crazy enough story, but somehow the fact that the kids don't end up single-handedly saving the day lends added realism to the screen. The film tries to add even more melodrama by sympathetically portraying a young girl who is part of the terrorist group, but she doesn't get enough screen time for it to matter. In one way, she does end up as the deus ex machina to one heck of a dilemma which surfaces late in the film.

And now, the media-bashing paragraph: I can't believe how irresponsible the media was in this picture. The hospital's getting taken over by terrorists doesn't escape the press's attention, and soon reporters and camera crews are all camped out outside the hospital, posting their reports, filming their clips, and endangering those trying to escape by exposing them on camera. This is what happens in the movie, yeah, but you and I can see this happening in real life, right? It's all about the ratings, baby.

I say, overlook the low budget production values and the non-acting (the best actor here is this girl whose character's name is Jib). Tolerate the slow moments in the first half of the film. Try not to get exasperated at the exasperating kid (his name is Pong) whose martial arts discipline is knee-biting. Because you'll want to check out POWER KIDS for the really decent martial arts stuff. Thai boxing is the shiznit, and these kids demonstrate a real aptitude for it. I don't mean the knee biter.

The DVD has two bonus featurettes: the Making of POWER KIDS (00:08:41 minutes long, with English sub-titles) and footage which goes behind the scenes of some of the action sequences (00:04:38 minutes, without English subtitles, but you don't need them).",1289088000,5,4213,4.717391304347826
