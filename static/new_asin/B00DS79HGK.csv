5852039,5,B00DS79HGK,"I love movies that entertain me, this movie doesn't take it self too seriously and maintains an even feel throughout. The comparison to the Road Warrior are right on with the look of this film in its future of desolation; but the ideas aren't as serious or grim. I keep seeing a lot of comparisons with Tarantino but I think this would be more of a Robert Rodriguez style of film. If Bounty Killer and Planet Terror played a double feature, it would be like a Grind-house Heaven. If you like fun fast pace action with a nice dose of quality gore thrown at you, this is your kind of movie. I am still smiling after watching this flick.",1379376000,5,634,4.336134453781512

5852054,3,B00DS79HGK,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this film. Post apocalypse films can run the gambit from good to god awful luckily Bounty Killer is squarely down the middle .Its not great cinema but it's not cringe inducing by any stretch. The box art IS very misleading as you are led to believe Kristanna Lokken is the female lead which is NOT the case. Lokken is in the film and has a strong secondary role but is not Mary Death the female lead who is actually played by Christian Pitre. Bounty Killers are well bounty hunters working to collect bounties mainly placed upon greedy former corporate types who led the world to ruin. Drifter played by Michael Marsten is a loner who collects bounties but is over shadowed by his former protg Mary Death. They have a past but try and stay apart but forces bring them together .Back to Ms. Lokken for a moment she plays a corporate executive named Catherine who was once married to former exec Drifter and has placed a bounty on his head. She also has a corporate bounty hunter Van Sterlin played by Gary Busey ! at her disposal. Mary also was once a part of a traveling group of gypsy bounty hunters that want a piece of her ass now. A part of the story unfolds at a saloon/brothel called the Thirsty Beaver 9love that name) run by Lucille the still lovely Beverly D;Angelo. Of course any movie featuring guns,bounties,mad max rejects chasing after people,corporate greed and cleavage cannot be all bad right? Marstens is good as Drifter he's aided by his gun caddy Jack Le Mans (Barak Hardly) a goof ball type of sidekick .Pitre as Mary Death looks super sexy her acting is not that good but not awful either. Lokken is good as the cold hard bitch and looks great as usual. Busey and D'Angelo are good in their roles as well. Recommended for those who like B films and post apocalypse films.",1460160000,3,1836,4.483582089552239

5852066,4,B00DS79HGK,"There is nothing as open to an easy adaptation to the screen as a graphics novel.  Movies love its stereotypical characters, violence, and simplicity. Such movies can claim they are following an artist's vision; so every heroine is well endowed and perfectly made up. Every guy is a step down from Bradley Cooper in good looks but a badder boy than any character yet played by Cooper.

Bounty Killer is a superbly silly and delightful example of this genre.

A masterpiece of this form, Aeon Flux is blessed with a better plot and more gifted actors. But we can be content with BK because there are only so many times we can watch Charlize Theron before we ourselves morph from viewers into stalkers... .

All viewers know BK is there for the fun of it.

The aesthetic standards in BK are lets-have-fun-and-see-silly-stuff-and-enjoy-the-added-pleasure-of-a passing-glimpse of boobies.

Whoo-hoo! as Homer would say and ask for another Duff.

The farthest stretch of believability in BK is the conceit that six-pack of Budweiser becomes a  treasure beyond measure.

(I mean, a six of Bud!  I cant think of any economic crisis that would force us into so dark a dystopian world that Bud would be valued much above green apple Koolaid mixed with radiator coolant.)

Do not expect a fleet of wild stunt vehicles as way  cool as those seen in any of the Mad Max franchise.  MM flicks have budgets as big as the GNP of any number of central African or Central American countries.

Anyhow we get to see attractive women running around in sorta cheerleader tunics, stunts featuring guys that can turn gross since the guys debone arms and fillet other body parts. And to round out the crazy, we see Gary Busey acting like Gary Busey.

With the closing credits we see the movie was an enjoyable effort for the cast and reflect that it is certainly a pleasant distraction for us.",1443571200,,1868,4.75776397515528

Matthew Marsden makes a charismatic loner hero with a dark past, and sidekick Barak Hardley not only fulfills the comic relief role, he plays marsden's conscious -- and gets into the action too.

The movie really belongs to Christian Pitre as Mary Death, the love interest who could carry a film of her own. She's also given a backstory as interesting as the lead's.

Kristanna Lokken and Gary Busey pop up in scenery-chewing rolls, but that's too be expected (and relished).

Now bounty hunters are playing an off screen sort of reality show where they are hunting down the corporate leaders who caused the collapse of civilization. Now forget about all that and the film follows the story of two bounty hunters, one being a new comer who resembles Yasmin Bleeth, and the other the British talking Mad Max wanna be who looks more like Michael Tracer from the newer Knight Rider series.

They have a love hate relationship, and she throws temper tantrums when she doesn't get her own way. A story happens... as they do, and these bounty hunters find themselves teaming up to plead for one of their lives when they go from a bounty hunter to a wanted man.

A few little twists and turns, and all of a sudden a guy who models his look on Jake from Two & A Half Men and an old dude who likes beer create a team to cross a desert that gypsies roam... however the gypsies are more like the clowns from Mad Max II.

Overall, it's an OK viewing for one night, but I can't see it being something I would ever want to watch again. It has a bit of blood, but hardly enough to call it a Grind-house flick. Had they gone that way it probably would have had something special, but this one fails that mark by ____that much of being on the verge to say it's worthy of being 3 stars.

If boobs, blood and babes is your thing in a mindless bounty killing world out in the middle of the desert, then try B*tch Slap instead of this movie... but if you must see it, no one can stop you. But I wouldn't be paying a great lot of attention to the 4 and 5 star reviewers here... it's a half decent flick that could have been much better, not a fantastic nod to movies of the past like this. I'm not saying I hated it, but at the same time, it's not great either. Once the nostalgia feel passes that ""they just don't make em like this anymore"" wears off, you realize... actually, they do still make them like this, and this one could have been a bit better in either the gore, comedy or plain out stupid gratuitous nudity.

Overall.. rental before you buy.",1397692800,,2143,4.217073170731707
5852112,3,B00DS79HGK,"Bounty Killer is a WONDERFUL little B movie. It's a violent exploitation flick set in the near future where corporate power has so far outstripped government power that the corporations have actually started warring with each other and turned much of America into a wasteland. This leads to an nascent government called the Council of 9 to arise. The Council of 9 starts issuing Death Warrants with considerable rewards on various corporate heads, and a class of bounty hunters arise to collect those rewards, becoming folk heroes in the process as they drive the mangled corpses of One Percenters to their ragtag villages to collect their rewards.

The basic appeal of this film is seeing One percenter corporate honchos and their minions getting shotgun-blasted, stabbed, and machine-gunned by regular guys. It delivers a fair amount of that. Of course, the corporate types fight back, there's your conflict, and it's all great fun if you don't think about it seriously for more than a nanosecond.

The film has two major flaws. One, the filmmaker is obvious deeply enamored of Mad Max and set much of his film in the California desert with various oddly-dressed sorts riding around at high speed on motorcycles, cars and Winnebagos and stabbing and shooting each other. There's also a bunch of degenerate, cannibalistic wasteland dwellers called ""gypsies"" who do violent things a lot because they're just violent people, who are in my opinion a complete waste, as they contribute nothing to the main theme of regular guys vs. evil corporate scumbags.

The other major flaw is that the Mad Max imitation just makes the film look cheap. So many bad Roger Corman flicks have been set in run down shacks in the California deserts cause it's cheap that any film that imitates Mad Max just looks like another Roger Corman cheapie.

If the film had focused more sharply on its central theme of corporate scumbags vs. heavily armed regular folks, it would have been much, much better, but the Mad Max imitation stuff just kinda kidnaps the movie and waters down its central theme.

Still, there are several extended scenes of regular guys in stylish desert leathers invading corporate cubicle farms and shooting and stabbing and beating up on One Percenters in three piece suits ... something so SATISFYING about seeing a Wall Street type get a shotgun to the face ... mmmmm. I know it's revenge porn, but it's the only kind of revenge we seem to be able to get nowadays. Enjoy!",1397606400,,2473,4.9066985645933014
5852113,4,B00DS79HGK,"[a spoiler-free review]

Bounty Killer is a cultural mishmash that manages to borrow from multiple mediums and blend them appealingly (if you don't mind *gallons* of blood splashing everywhere) for its 92-minute duration. Good acting was never the intent here, but it did take some talent to portray these roles as intended. Additionally, most of the minor characters in Bounty Killer are presented with a thoughtfulness that makes this more of a ""B+ movie"" than a B movie. Combined with some handy camerawork and large helpings of a tongue-in-cheek attitude, you get a lotta fun. The plot was more of a background device than a coherent and crucial aspect to Bounty Killer, yet there is something surely charming about the premise of slaughtering CEOs who helped to destroy the economy and the planet. The pace of the film is insane at times... it certainly held my attention from beginning to end.

One of the negative reviewers stated that many aspects of the film were for the ""stuck-at-thirteen crowd,"" but he [1] didn't seem to understand that Bounty Killer celebrates B movies, [2] likely missed cultural references, and [3] provided a ludicrous complaint against the short skirts and clevage. Drifter without Mary Death would be like Crouching Tiger without Hidden Dragon, and Mary exuding her sensuality was quite simply the icing on Bounty Killer's cake.

The acting is what you'd expect for a B-movie,  action scenes are decent, some original humor ... some cliche, and nice eye candy for a main character.
Just prior to the finale, one would consider this just a typical B movie ... good for a rainy day rental.
Then, the final battle starts (let the carnage begin!). The viewer is finally rewarded with well orchestrated fight scenes and a good soundtrack to boot. You'll laugh your @ss off and cheer as the chaos wages on and the villainess gets her due. If you're a fan of the B movie genre, this ending is sure to please. You may even find yourself going back to watch the finale again just for the pure enjoyment of it.

5852136,5,B00DS79HGK,"Bounty Killer, released September 2013, is appropriately Rated R. The 93 minute film directed and co-written by Henry Saine, stars Matthew Marsden. I watched this movie, not expecting much. In fact, just the opposite really, I expected cheesy and lame. Love it when I am wrong (sometimes, lol). Bounty Killer 2013

Think Mad Max, meets QuentinTarantino. Bounty Killer opens in the midst of an apocalypse brought on the globe by greedy corporations, (villains in gun-metal blue suits, white pressed shirts and sunlight yellow neckties). A Counsel of Nine has been created by the people. It is the only way to fight back against the Corporations still reeking havoc on a clearly dying society. The Counsel sets up a force of bounty killers and uses them to track down CEOs and business big wigs now Wanted for all the wrong doings, and injustices they have caused and allowed to spill out over the continents.

The bounty killers very similar to bounty hunters, except those on the posters are Wanted dead. Not alive. Like any Wanted system, the bigger the corporate leader, the more the bounty. The killers are treated like celebrities. Media-made-famous, and loved by the people. The killers make a difference, setting out to right all the wrongs. That is, until the Counsel puts out a bounty on Drifter (Marsden), who is one of the most famous killers of them all. And all Marsden wants to do is reach the Counsel and plead his case, despite being repeatedly warned that he will be shot and killed before ever entering the Counsel.

In a race from point A to point B, Drifter is joined by a small band of friends, like his newest gun caddy (Barak Hardley), and the number one bounty killer, Mary Death (Christian Pitre). It is a dangerous trek across the radioactive badlands; facing the Gypsiesa formidable group of cannibalistic bounty killers with agendas against Mary Death and Drifter.

Other stars in the film include Gary Busey as Van Sterling, Beverly DAngelo as Lucielle, and Eve Jeffers as Mocha Sukata. Filled with some great action, credible dialogue, creative blood and gore killings, sexy women and a compelling plot, I enjoyed Bounty Killer very much. There was still some cheesieness to it, but I did not find anything lame. I did not play with my phone, and while not as classic a film as Mad Max, it was nearly parallel in story-line.  I am giving Bounty Killer 4 out of 5 Tombstones!

It is a rebooted Roger Corman type movie with elements of Mad Max thrown in for good measure.  The stars, Matthew Marsden and Christian Pitre, are a great looking couple with wonderful tongue-in-cheek chemistry.  Some of the supporting players do not fare as well ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, but perhaps that was the director walking that fine line of action/comedy.  One cannot help loving the idea that someone out there made a film about placing a bounty on corporate greed and handling the whole thing Rambo/Mad Max style.

5852147,5,B00DS79HGK,"This review was originally posted to my blog on October 23, 2013.

""Bounty Killer"" was originally based on a short film of the same name by Jason Dodson and Henry Saine, and its wildly over-the-top actions sequences, graphic violence, artsy visual style, and occasional use of short animated sequences keeps it fairly true to its origins. This is because the original creators were also involved in adapting it into a feature length film.

Set in a futuristic dystopia, this actioner takes place twenty years after The Corporate Wars, in which mega-corporations have toppled world governments, and then fought one another for world domination. As the world spiraled into oblivion, the top corporate executives abandoned their armies and fled with the remaining wealth. Born from the ash of a destroyed planet rose the enigmatic Council of Nine, who vow to rebuild and give hope to the survivors. The Council issues death warrants on all white-collared criminals to assure that big business never gets in control again and for providing the survivors of the apocalypse with retribution. This spawns bounty killers who compete for body count, fame, and a fat stack of cash.

Foremost amongst the Councils bounty killers is a veteran named Francis Gorman aka Drifter (Matthew Marsden), a stoic aging hunter. Then there is Mary Death (Christian Pitre). A sexy diva that is as glitzy as she is brash, even sporting her own supped up yellow Ford Mustang. While Mary plays to her adoring fans and the press, Drifter shies away more interested in getting the job done than making headlines.

When we first meet these two, we find them both together riding up an elevator to a holographic go-go club to take out a CEO (Ivar Brogger) and his cronies. From the moment they both interact, we know that these to share a past together. Later we discover Mary Death was not only his protg but his lover, until Drifter decided he wanted to retire and take her with him. Mary, however, had other plansgoing soloso she ended their relationship by stabbing him in the spleen and leaving him to die in the wastelands.

When Drifter suddenly finds himself with a bounty on his head, Mary decides to cash in. Drifter holds a dark secret to his past and desires to find the Council of Nine to plead his case, something that no one has ever done beforemainly because no one actually knows where the council resides.

Slowly unfolding through Drifters journeygun caddy Jack LeMans (Barak Hardley) and old acquaintance Jimbo (Abraham Benrubi) along for the ridewe discover Drifter is not the only one with a secret. Mary too still runs from her past. She is a runaway from a band of wasteland warriors known as Gypsies, who still want her back, and Mary must cross through their territory if she hopes to collect the bounty.

Making it across the wasteland, Mary catches up to her ex-lover. In a face-to-face stand off Drifter tells Mary hes not going fight her and he wants to talk. When Mary threatens Jack and Jimbo, Jack admonishes her and Drifter and tells them that they should stopping acting like children, because it is obvious they are both still in love with one another. Mary agrees to go with them to the council, but warns them that when the judges find Drifter guilty, shell be the one to carry out the execution. The four of them set out with a secret map Mary has acquired.

However, when they finally arrive at the council building, they find the council dead and Drifter has been setup. It appears Drifter had once been a CEO of a corporation that manufactured planes, and had been betrayed by his business partners who sold them to militias during the Corporate Wars. When the council had formed, Drifter had been recruited as the first bounty killer, because he wished to make amends for all the destruction and death that had result from his company. He knew all along it was not the Council who had issued the death warrant, but he needed to find out who it was. It turns out that it was one his former business partners (Kristanna Loken) and her henchman (Gary Busey); all to draw him out and reinstated him as the company CEO once again.

There have been many other small budget post-apocalypse films, but non-so entertaining in recent years. This is not only due to the well-written script and direction, but because the acting is also top notch, all the way down to the cameos by Beverly DAngelo and Rapper Eve.

If you're looking for a film with plenty of car chases, bloody battles with exploding heads and dismemberment, a brooding mercenary and his hot protg in knee-high white boots, then this fun and entertaining, over-the-top post apocalyptic action film is sure to please.",1383350400,16,4682,4.776266996291718
5852148,1,B00DS79HGK,"This is a movie designed for guys who stopped their mental growth at age thirteen. Evidence:
First, really cheaply made comic book drawings similar to what twelve year olds would doodle to fill class time but in this case is filling a good part of the movie - saves on production costs and even more so on having to tell a story. No subtitles because talking just interferes with the red dyed corn syrup.
Second, somehow way in the future after the wealthy have devastated (how was never explained) the Earth people still use '70s tools, cars and guns. That is creative storytelling?
Third, cheap rip off storyline of a little Mad Max and a lot of grindhouse but does a disservice to both.
Fourth, Pitre's acting resume consists of a few roles with a short skirt and boobs showing all for the stuck-at-thirteen crowd which is how she contributes to selling a movie.
Fifth, film editing offers brief moments of cheap bloody prosthetics as if thrown in as an afterthought or to keep the script from putting viewers asleep. Boring!",1383350400,5,1028,4.685082872928176
5852149,4,B00DS79HGK,"This is a lower tier ""Mad Max"" grindhouse. In the future hostile corporate takeovers involve bombs and bullets. The world is thrust into the apocalypse. Corporations dominate while the Wasteland attempts to gain back the world. They are ruled by a Council of Nine who place bounties on the heads of corporations. It appears the poor want to get money so they can live like the people they despise, although this Orwellian aspect is not part of the tale. Bad guys are easy to identify because they wear yellow ties. The plot didn't make a lot of sense, but then this wasn't a plot driven film.

Drifter (Matthew Marsden) and Mary Death (Christian Pitre) are the Bonnie and Clyde of Bounty Hunters. When a bounty is offered on Drifter, he wants to clear his name with the Council of Nine. Mary Death confuses us as she wants to go with him to help him in one scene and then wants to shoot him in the next. Drifter, along with his side kick (Barak Hardley) must pass through the Badlands and fight off cannibal gypsies. Only vintage cars seem to survive the apocalypse.

Beverly D'Angelo and Gary Busey from the ""where are they now"" crowd appear briefly in the film. The film boasts a lot of blood squirts, severed limbs, CG flames, and a token Brit (Kevin McNally). Mary Death speaks in sexual innuendos, even to her car. She is dressed in a red and white mini dress...like a car hop, stockings, and white go-go boots with killer sharp spurs. And she can take a punch to the face.

If you are starved for a Mad Max style grindhouse, this should hold off the hunger pains.
