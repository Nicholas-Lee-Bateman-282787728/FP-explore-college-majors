7787921,3,0310266378,The book is excellent. I would definitely give it a 5-star.  The DVD Bible study was just OK.  It seems dated and didn't go over so well with our group.,1491177600,,152,4.033333333333333

7787923,4,0310266378,I plan on using this book in a bible study setting.  John Ortberg presents his material in a friendly easy way that will prove to do well in a discussion format,1392508800,,160,4.161290322580645

His creative DVD's are stimulating for our purpose.",1357603200,,125,5.3
7787925,5,0310266378,This is a good small group video series. We have used it at our CC Choir meetings and in 15 - 20 minutes it provides a nice emphasis to our practices.,1238803200,5,150,3.870967741935484
7787926,5,0310266378,"This review is for John Ortberg's book and DVD and the study guide that accompanies them.  We purchased these items for use with our Christian small group and found it to be an excellent study. The book is very engaging and full of ""gems"" and practical applications for allowing us to realize that God is right here, closer than we think.
You could do the study with just the DVD and study guide but I highly reccomend the book as the DVD is a much abbreviated version of the text. The study guide has plenty of thought and discussion provoking questions (way more than we could do in any 1 1/2 hour session).",1238630400,8,609,4.389380530973451
