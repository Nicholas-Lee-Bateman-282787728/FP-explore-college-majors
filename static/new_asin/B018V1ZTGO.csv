7556345,5,B018V1ZTGO,"The Complete Series/Season 9 of Doctor Who is a throw-back to the first couple of season's of the Doctor Who re-boot
The season is balanced but, almost each episode is a 2 part movie in a sense
 Steven Moffat wrote less then 5 episodes for this season
The 2-part season opening The Magician's Apprentice and  The Witch's Familiar"" has problems to say the least due to Moffat's so/so writing
I can honestly respect his love for classic Doctor Who but, his writing can be so terrible the man is king of writing plot-holes!
Episode 3 & 4 ""Under the Lake & Before the Flood"" written by Toby Whithouse (Best know for BBC's Being Human) is a great and super enjoyable 2 part ghost story!
Then it comes to one of the most interesting Stories in a long time with
""The Girl Who Died""  &  The Woman Who Lived"" which introduces Ashildr aka Lady Me  aka Me (who becomes a immortal) much like  Captain Jack Harkness played by Game of Thrones's Maisie Williams
Maisie is simply amazing and delivers one of the best performances since the re-boot
The character of Me is also a big part of this season
 The Zygon Invasion 1 & 2  Osgood  (Ingrid Oliver) returns now wearing a shirt with question marks on the collars, like the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Doctors, and a cardigan similar to the Seventh  (Classic Doctor Who)
is simply a Anti-War super smart story about hate and why we kill each other in a sense
It's enjoyable but, also a little sad since the social context is real it's saying a hell of a lot about us as the real monster
Ingrid Oliver is outstanding hopefully we see her more next season!
Episode 9 Sleep No More"" is one of two episode that are stand alone 1 shots
This is Dr Who Meets Doom almost this entire episode it told in POV aka First Person Shooter
and it gets a bit hard to watch the story itself is interesting dealing with a cooperation that want's there employees to never sleep
It's bizarre but, a little scary since everything living needs to sleep
 Episode 10 ""Face the Raven"" is Clara's last adventure with the Doctor
The Dr and Clara go to 2015 London to help  Rigsy with a unique tattoo they discover an alien community hidden in plain sight and being protected
by Ashildr aka Mayor Me  (Maisie Williams now looks modern) Clara being careless makes a huge mistake and death comes for her
the whole thing is a set-up by Me who is being blackmailed but, was told nobody would be harmed
Clara dies and the Doctor is teleported
 ""Heaven Sent""  is a slow burn that in many ways makes no sense  the Dr has been trapped four billion years and keeps being killed over and over again  (This episode is another great example of Steven Moffat going off the deep end and being cheap and lazy)
Episode 12 ""Hell Bent"" is bitter sweet!
The Doctor walks into a diner in  Nevada looking for someone (This set-up was used during the final episode of Quantum Leap)
the waitress physically identical to Clara,starts talking to him he begins to tell her a ""story"" about Clara
The Dr returns to Gallifrey mostly to use there extraction chamber to retrieve Clara from her timeline at the instant of her death
This final episode of the 9th Season isn't bad it just has odd plot holes and problems

The 9th Season as a whole is epic and though it has a few lack luster episodes it's really enjoyable from episode 1-12
Peter Capaldi is the Doctor and he plays the role with energy and love
Jenna Coleman was more of a throw-back to characters like Rose Tyler, Martha Jones and  Donna Noble she fit in such a perfect way
The biggest problem with Clara was her back-story it changed a great deal one moment she went from being around in every version of the Doctor  prior to becoming the ""companion"" and dying  the Matt Smith version of the Dr. seemed afraid of her at times mostly cause he couldn't figure out what she was..... a lot of that back-story disappeared or maybe I'm a massive dummy and missed something
Regardless it'll be hard to find a solid replacement for Clara Oswald her memory will live on forever

7556376,3,B018V1ZTGO,"Peter Capaldi is one of the greatest actors to portray Dr. Who. Unfortunately, he has been saddled with too many second-rate scripts during his time as The Doctor. The best eps in Series 9 involve the ""Me"" character portrayed by ""Game Of Thrones"" actress Maisey Williams as well as the two-parter involving the Zygons.  Companion Clara gets a proper send-off in the last two eps, but Series 9 is a mixed bag at best.

If I had to give a criticism, it would be the Doctor's assessment that there is no life after death.  Seems to me, that is really out of character.  The Doctor does not make pronouncements of things beyond his purview, and Religion and Eternity is one of those things.  I am not offended, but a bit disappointed in the screenwriters.  I would prefer they stick with either supporting Church of England doctrine or just keeping silent.  (My favorite scene of all time is when the Doctor describes the Holy Family arriving in Bethlehem.  ""There was no room in the inn.  I should know, I got the last room."")",1483056000,,854,4.695945945945946

7556449,5,B018V1ZTGO,"Peter Capaldi's second season vastly improved and overcame the uneven tone of his first season. The biggest change in this series is the number of two part stories that still feed into an overall arc of events. Capaldi's speech on War he gives in the Black Archive at the end of the Zygon two-parter is easily one of the finest written and delivered speeches in Dr. Who history (yes, I'm including Matt Smith's ""I am talking"" speech in the Pandorica Opens in that statement).  Even more impressive is Capaldi's solo performance in an episode that makes ""Groundhog Day"" look like a walk in the park. The cherry on top is the closure to the River Song story line in ""The Husbands of River Song,""",1482624000,,693,4.588709677419355

7556455,1,B018V1ZTGO,"Unlike some other viewer's reviews here about this series, it is the worst in both story lines and the Doctor himself. Jenna Coleman was almost as good as she was with Matt Smith, but there is NO charisma between her and the new Doctor.at all. And he is often a very self doubting and often mumbling Doctor. Both Matt Smith and David tenant were FAR better Doctors. In addition, the stories under Steven Moffat are so far fetched and are ridiculous. This is no longer a kids series, but he seems to have not realized this! Of course, some of his stories with Matt and David were also, but it is far worse with the Peter Capaldi series. I would rate .Capaldi just above Collin Baker, followed by Sylvester McCoy, then by Patrick Loughton, as the worst Doctors.. The Capadli series are so bad I will never watch one a second time, but the just about all the other Doctors are all fun to watch over and over. But no Doctor has been better than Tom Baker was! And he appeared in one of the last episodes with Matt - that was soooooo nice!

So, if you have not seen the latest Doctor, yet, but have seen some or much of the others, my guess is that you will be quite disappointed. As for the companions, here is how I rate them throughout all of Doctor Who: (#1) Romana I (Mary Tam) with Tom Baker (not the second season Romana who was Tom's wife), (#2) Amy Pond (Karen Gillan ) with Matt Smith, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) with Jon Pertwee & Tom Baker, and following very close is Clara (Jenna Coleman) with Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi.

7556486,3,B018V1ZTGO,"I'm having to make myself get this just for completeness.

I disagree with most of these reviews... I found this a terrible season.  I like Peter Capaldi as the Doctor; I think, given decent material, he could be a wonderful Doctor, but the writing is just abysmal.

I have nothing against Jenna Coleman, either, but she's not my favorite companion.

This series reminds me so much of Sylvestor McCoy; he also could have been a GREAT Doctor, but the writing was awful.  I watched the programs live last year, and I don't have the Blu-ray yet, so the following things are from my memories of the series:

Note: if you haven't seen the series, potential spoilers below:

The penultimate program ""Heaven Sent"" was so boring that I nearly turned it off... and breaking through the wall a little bit each time didn't make sense - if the structure ""reset"" itself, why didn't the wall?

""Hell Bent"" - ""Let's see how many references to previous Dr Who stories I can throw in, even though they are utterly pointless"".  And Clara, back again!  She had a great, sacrificial death in The Raven - bringing her back was an error, in my opinion.

Missy - thank goodness she didn't appear after the first two shows. And they never did gave a satisfactory answer why she isn't dead. And Missy is just too un-Master-like.  The Master had no compunction about killing people who got in the way of his plans, or were insolent, but he didn't go about killing people just because he could. Missy ain't the Master.

I kind of like The Girl Who Died / The Woman Who Lived. As someone else pointed out, it would have been better, probably, for The Woman Who Lived to have been shown later.  I did wonder about how long the Doctor has had that healing device. Why didn't he use it on the many other people who have died?

My summary of the season is ""It's not terrible"", but it could be so much better.

I kept hoping that the Doctor would stop being so self-obsessed and grow up into a caring person... The sonic sunglasses are idoitic... what's next? Sonic Shoes?  A Sonic flower in his suit lapel? The rock star scene with the tank was a real put-off.

I'm very much afraid with the Master becoming Missy, and that general regenerating into a woman, that they are going to have one of the upcoming Doctors be female.

The series is starting to lose me, after having been a fan for over 35 years.
==============
Update: I've received the Blu-ray and have been watching the series over again.

""Last Christmas"" was better than I remembered; however, I think that there were other scenes added that weren't shown on BBC America. It actually made more sense this time around.  I'd give that one a four-star.

I've seen The Magician's Apprentice and The Witch's Familiar.  Again, upon the re-watch, it seemed to make more sense than I remember. Still don't like (1) bringing back Missy (""just because I can"", per SM), (2) Don't like changing the core of who the Doctor is... it's been established for DECADES that he left Gallifrey because he wanted to DO SOMETHING about the evil in the world.  Suddenly, just for the sake of an ""arc"" this season, he left Gallifrey because he was afraid of ""The Hybrid"" (about which we've never heard anything).  Clara's words coming out wrong from the Dalek - maybe a clever plot point, but it doesn't fit with the first time we saw Clara, remember? And what does it say about all of the other Daleks?  It's like something thinks ""this would be a cool plot twist"" without ANY thought given to who the Doctor is and/or series continuity.

I'll probably do another update after the next pair of episodes.",1475452800,,3610,4.565217391304348

7556532,5,B018V1ZTGO,Exceptional writing combines challenging ideas ( they say something about the human condition in a fantasy genre) and believable relationships. A triumph by Steven Moffat ( Sherlock) in the construction and  dialogue. Fine direction. This is believable TV on its own terms. The real achievement is that we care about the characters which takes skilful acting in the artificial world. Episode 11 contains the best portrait of paranoia since Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer. That Caoaldi is the only actor who speaks in the 50 minute duration is a testament to his acting abilities. This Doctor Who is hugely underrated and ignored as the serious TV it is.  Up there with Neuromancer and much more complex.,1466294400,3,703,5.104347826086957
7556533,5,B018V1ZTGO,"In short, prepare to enjoy this season of Peter Capaldi's Doctor even *more* than last season.  I certainly have.  Long may the Doctor Who series survive, staying true to its core values, avoiding corporate ideas that try to sidetrack it and ruin it, and stay alive up to and beyond its second set of 25 seasons (I want to be there to watch the new series finish its 25th season and know that it will be alive and kicking in the seasons that follow).  And for those who say that Moffatt has ruined the new Doctor Who series, I have rarely (if ever) been disappointed by his writing.  The only disappointment I can think of right now is:  I truly wish that ""The Wedding of River Song"" and ""The Husbands of River Song"" had been longer than they were.

This is a review of the DVD set itself, not a comment on the episodes or the series.  At least on this initial release, discs 1 & 4 have shows in a degraded format with Horizontal scan lines constantly distracting the viewer from the episodes themselves.  Episodes affected are ''Last Christmas'', ''Heaven Sent'', ''Hell Bent'', and ''Husbands Of River Song''.  These horizontal scan lines give the episodes a 240p visual quality, like watching a low quality VHS recording from thirty years ago or more, without the noise.

Stunningly, the 'Doctor Who Extra' for ''Last Christmas'' features clips from the episode which have a superior quality than the feature on the same disc.  I'm use to the extras being of a lower visual quality, but this is the first time in my life it's been the other way around.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET until BBC Worldwide corrects the issues...!

(I would post stills showing the problem, but don't want a copyright issue to be claimed as a pretext for removing my review.)",1461024000,14,1176,5.464088397790055
7556605,5,B018V1ZTGO,"I loved this season and was excited to see it came with the ""Husbands of River Song"" along with ""Last Christmas"". The only episode I didn't care for was ""Heaven Sent"", other than that it was a good season with nods to the 10th and 11th Doctors. I ended up having to get it elsewhere since only Prime Members can purchase it here which is a bit unethical on Amazons part and I refuse to be extorted into buying a Prime Membership..",1460937600,,430,4.2560975609756095
7556616,1,B018V1ZTGO,"This review is for the Blu-ray version only, and the one star is only given for terms of quality. This is a 4-disc set that over in the UK was 6 discs. 14 episodes - several of which are an hour or more in length - are crammed onto 3 dual layer BDs, and thats to say nothing of the various commentary tracks and DW Extras each of those discs contain. The fourth disc contains NO episodes, but houses more special features.

Simply, that's an uncomfortable fit for that much video and audio and results in compression. What's the point of having all this glorious technology when only the number crunchers (We can fit this on four discs and most people won't notice.) win in the end? A friend who purchased both this set and the UK version did some comparisons and found that on the US set the episodes contained about a third less visual information! For instance, ""Last Christmas"" was 14.4 GB on the UK set vs. 9.8 GB on the US. The audio tracks, too, came up similarly short. From a quality standpoint, you're probably better off buying (or holding on to) the bare bones Parts One & Two Season Nine Blu-ray sets, as they only have three episodes per disc, but of course they don't have all the bells and whistles found here.

This is a truly crappy way to treat loyal fans and consumers here in the States, BBC. It didn't have to be this way. You could have spread the set across six discs just as they did across the pond.",1460073600,36,1425,4.333333333333333

7556619,4,B018V1ZTGO,"Series 9 is an odd duck. There are things that are briliant (Capaldi, Coleman, the opening Davros two parter, the finale), ambitious yet a bit ""off"" (the entire series basically being two parters, Ashielder/Me, Sleep no more POV), the token ""dog"" of the season (The woman Who Lived) and things that were very confusing (mostly the whole Zygon thing and how all the rules about them had changed--which was ok but as a classic fan, it took a little getting used to)

I can't quite decide if I liked it as much as series 8 but I'm glad that I'll be able to comfortably revisit the whole thing again via DVD *and* that they've reconfigured the order so it not only starts with a Christmas special but ENDS with a Christmas special for once. I always found it annoying when the Christmas special got held over for a year. I'm sure they'll misguidedly go back to that to that at some point when the show's back in full production again but for now, some nice closure. Recommended.",1457222400,2,974,4.502824858757062

There seems to be a lot of people who either don't like Peter Capaldi as the Doctor, or who don't appreciate the convoluted stories that make up this series, or both. I think I understand. Don't get me wrong, I love Doctor Who, including Series 9. But the stories do often go beyond straight sci-fi adventure stories. There's more twisty-turny stuff going on (which may be a relative of the timey-wimey stuff).

But how could I resist seeing more of Missy? And I liked the exploration of immortality as a curse.  Also, I was fascinated by the idea of toiling 4 billion years to save someone. That's the opposite side of immortality being a curse.

There are a lot of Bonus Extras included with the Complete Series 9 Collection.  The only ones that may be repeats from prior releases are the ""Behind the Scenes Featurettes"".

....E.  Series 8 recap
....F.  Series 9 Trailers and Prologue. In the 1-minute long Prologue, the Doctor is hiding out with the Sisters of Karn.
Sister: ""Why do you always lie?""
Doctor: ""Why do you always assume I'm lying?""
Sister: ""It saves time.""
....G.  ""The Doctor's Meditation"" (6 minutes) This is a prequel to ""The Magician's Apprentice"", the 1st episode of Series 9. The Doctor picks a remote castle n 1138 Essex to ponder what may be the upcoming end of his life. Pondering includes being a magician. Ordering the digging of wells. And asking for a sun-roof.
Medieval Laird: ""What is it you dread?""
Doctor: ""Why would I dread anything?""
Laird: ""You're always making jokes. You never sit still, like a man in fear of days to come.""
....H.  Deleted Scenes
....I.  ""2015 San Diego Comic Con Panel"" (63 minutes) Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Michelle Gomez and Steven Moffat on the San Diego state, moderated by Chris Harwick (TV host and uber-fan).
Capaldi starts out: ""I've never been in front of 7,000 people before in my life.""
Gomez is asked about Missy and the Doctor: ""It's this great friendship that just went wrong.... It seems to be like her life's purpose to chase after the Doctor  and try and make him understand: ""No  YOU started it. I'M right.""
....J.  Wil Wheaton interviews Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman. Wheaton is an American blogger and actor, probably best known for his portrayal of young Wesley Crusher on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".
....K.  ""Writing Who"". Women writers have not been common on Doctor Who. This documentary follows Sarah Dollard as she creates ""Trap Street"", an episode that became Season 9's ""Face the Raven"". First she had to pitch her idea to Steven Moffat, then write the first draft, eventually seeing her story actually filmed. Dollard was born in Australia and moved to England to write for the BBC.  In an interview she says ""Getting to play in the Doctor Who toy box is a dream come true. Its a total honor to contribute to a show that has brought me such joy as a fan. However, writing for Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman has presented a serious problem: some days Ive been too excited to actually sit down and type!
....L.  ""Dalek Devotion"" In this feature, Steven Moffat tells how he was inspired by Dalek episodes written by Terry Nation, as he devised the two opening episodes of Series 9. Nation did not just write episodes with Daleks, he's credited with creating the Daleks, starting with the December 1963 episode, ""The Daleks"", for the first Doctor. Peter Capaldi features also.
....M.  ""The Adventures of River Song"" (10 minutes) Nina Toussaint-White plays Mels, Amy and Rory's childhood friend  in ""Let's Kill Hitler"" (episode 8, series 6). She's back to narrate this special where Alex Kingston and Steven Moffat talk about the creation of the River Song character. And why Alex just had to play it.
....N.  ""Doctor Who: Sublime Online"" This is a selection of video shorts from on-line, behind the scenes of Series 9. Includes many of the cast and characters.
....O.  ""Clara's Journey""  Colin McFarlane (plays Moran in ""Under the Lake"") takes us on a look at the life and times of the Impossible Girl. He  interviews Peter Capaldi, Matt Smith (the 11th Doctor) and Jenna Coleman.
....P.  ""The Fan Show's Finest"".  Christel Dee, or Captain Christel, hosts ""Doctor Who: The Fan Show"" on the Official Doctor Who youtube channel. For this featurette, she combines some of her videos, including ""a peek inside Steven Moffats writing lair, a look into the Old Monsters Retirement Home and step into the amazing world of Minecraft to find out how fans are celebrating their love for the show online"".  Last, but not least, she has mini-interviews with Peter Capaldi and Michelle Gomez.

Now that's a lot of bonuses.

7556623,5,B018V1ZTGO,"Season 9 has been by far and away the best of Doctor Who since the return of the series in 2005. Peter Capaldi was indeed 'unleashed' this year and, for my money, is the best Doctor since Tom Baker, although everybody has their own opinions. Jenna Coleman didn't have as much to do this season as Clara but she did a good job and her chemistry with Capaldi reached an even higher level than last year. Much negativity regarding Steven Moffat's writing; in past years I probably would have agreed. Not this season though. This has been some of his best DW writing ever. I really enjoyed Magician's Apprentice/Witch's Familiar but he ascends to epic levels with Heaven Sent and Hell Bent. (Capaldi, by the way, knocks it out of the park on both of these.) Heaven Sent is as intense an episode of any TV show I've seen in several years.

No series is without a couple of mediocre episodes however and, in my opinion, series 9 has two/three. The Zygon two parter didn't quite come off despite Capaldi and Coleman's best efforts to save it. These episodes are okay not great. Also, Sleep No More is a confused, weak story that I literally cannot watch as the found footage camera style gives me headaches. Once was enough for me on that one for several reasons.

There seems to be a lot of extras with the complete set. To be honest, some items are important to me and some of it is not. I'd love to get the Doctor's Meditation though, a thoroughly amusing short about the Doctor and his new found buddy Bors. Another reviewer mentioned the fact that both Capaldi Christmas episodes are included, which is a certainly a change. I have no knowledge to either confirm or deny that.

I guess the best recommendation I can give is this: I have a friend who has been ho hum about Doctor Who for years, although she eventually warmed to Matt Smith. I enticed her into watching Magician's Apprentice; she became hooked on the season and already owns series 9 part one with part two on order. Quite a turnaround.",1451952000,28,1999,4.516574585635359

7556625,5,B018V1ZTGO,"It's been 10 years (as of this writing) that ""New"" Who returned to television, in 2005. There have been bumps along the way, but most fans have enjoyed the ride.
In series nine, we have seen some stellar (and some not so stellar) performances from both Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman. The season finale episodes (Heaven Sent, Hell Bent) have received top marks among critics and fandom alike. Doctor Who began in November of 1963 and has been going strong ever since with an unprecedented longevity and worldwide popularity. Providing positive messages for young and old alike. ""Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up. Never give in.""
Series nine also sees the exit of long time companion Clara Oswald, in two different scenarios. Doctor Who sees some of the best writing in television (and some duds,  admittedly.) Overall, series nine has some great stories and leaves us breathless with anticipation for 2016's series ten.",1450224000,5,926,5.012987012987013

8743132,5,B018V1ZTGO,"Doctor Who series 9 sees the Doctor rocking it out as we have never seen him before thanks to Peter Capaldi's well-known talents as former front-man to the punk rock band ""The Dream Boys.""  If you have ever wanted to see or hear Mr. Capaldi play, this is the season you absolutely must have.  Though you do hear the guitar a little in series 10 (notably as Bill Potts comes into his office), this series 9 is by far the most musical and in many ways the most fun, especially in ""The Magician Apprentice."" The series finale is the critically acclaimed two part Heaven Sent/Hell Bent, the latter also featuring Peter Capaldi's rock version of ""The Impossible Girl.""  Not to be missed in this or any other time.",1533686400,,708,4.515625
