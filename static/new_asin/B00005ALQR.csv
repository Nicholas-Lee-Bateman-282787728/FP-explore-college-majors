7935450,4,B00005ALQR,"This is the English language version of the 1976 Italian documentary ""Uomini e squali"" ('Sharks and Men'), from director Bruno Vailati (co-director of 1961's ""Thief of Baghdad"" with Steve Reeves), narrated by Joseph Campanella, with a score by Daniele Patucchi (""Death Played the Flute"", ""Frankenstein 80"") and featuring an on-screen appearance by Ray Cannon, author of ""The Sea of Cortez.""

Traveling all over the world (the Red Sea, the Yucatan, Tahiti and Australia), we're treated to footage of all different species of sharks (bull, hammerhead, Great White), as well as other forms of sea life, like elephant seals, tuna and killer whales.

For those sensitive to such issues, there is a fair amount of casual cruelty in this film, including an ""improvised Caesarean"" of a pregnant shark (though, mercifully, her brood is cut loose and then freed to the sea) and gruesome shots of sharks being butchered.

Still, an informative if somewhat outdated documentary with lots of great underwater photography (even if a few of the shots have been tampered with in post-production, e.g. net lines matted in during the opening tuna-fishing segment).",1330819200,,1146,5.251366120218579
