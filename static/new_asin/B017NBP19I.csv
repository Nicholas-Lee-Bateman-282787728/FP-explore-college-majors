Its a mysterious force that shapes our universe.  It feels familiar, but its far stranger than anyone ever imagined.  And yet, one mans brilliant mind tamed it.  Gravity.

Using simple thought experiments, Albert Einstein [1879 to 1955] made an astonishing discovery: time and space are shaped by matter.  He called it the General Theory of Relativity [and published his theory on November 15, 1915].

How did one person, working almost entirely alone, change everything we thought we knew about the [mechanical] universe [of Isaac Newton]?

The above comes from the introduction of this fascinating documentary that celebrates the hundredth anniversary of Einsteins brilliant achievement, said to be perhaps the most remarkable feat of thinking about nature to come from a single mind.

This documentary traces the development of the General Theory of Relativity (said to be the perfect theory) and at the same time provides us with a biography of Einsteins life.

Were shown how Einsteins theory was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by testing it on a problem Newtons theory could not resolve.  As well, a prediction of Einsteins theory was verified.

As a result, Einstein became an iconic scientific genius who we still recognize today.

Incredibly, were told that this theory can be written as a single, elegant equation and we are even shown the equation itself!!  Its a beautiful, simple equation and this documentary does an excellent job explaining it.

As were told, new technology is now allowing us to explore the most remarkable predictions of this theory such as an expanding universe, black holes, ripples in space-time, and even the distortion of time itself.

Finally, everything about this documentary is spot-on from the narration to the photography.  And don't worry about not understanding somethingeverything is well-explained.

In conclusion, have you ever wondered why there is so much fuss over that Einstein guy?  This is the documentary to watch so as to understand why!!!!

8739843,4,B017NBP19I,"This is a relatively well organized and presented 'documentary' of sorts that focuses not so much on the life of Einstein but rather on his relativity theories, the ramifications thereof and subsequent attempts by scientists to both prove and apply his concepts toward other discoveries. Even at a fundamental level it's 'heady' stuff to understand and especially absorb although there are several basic explanatory examples to assist viewers. Contemporary scientists are featured periodically throughout to help explain various concepts. The primary focus seems to be designed to explain some of Einstein's work for non-theoretical physicists and mathematicians which of course includes most of us. Since it was featured on PBS's Nova it runs about an hour which I suspect is about as much as a non-scientist would prefer to spend on said topic, but the producers did a good job keeping it moving along and as entertaining/informative as possible under the circumstances for the curious.",1457913600,8,988,5.380645161290323
