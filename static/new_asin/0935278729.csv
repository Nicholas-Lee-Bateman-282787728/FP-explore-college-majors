7793444,5,0935278729,Fantastic DVD.  Thorough and well presented.  Love Marta Alto's manner and style of teaching.  A shirt does have many steps that can be daunting to a beginner.  I have returned to sewing after not sewing for many many years so really forgot a lot.  With a DVD you can replay any parts that you need to review as many times as necessary.  From this dvd I went on and purchased  all her videos from Palmer and Pletsch--I liked it that much.,1427414400,,438,4.333333333333333
