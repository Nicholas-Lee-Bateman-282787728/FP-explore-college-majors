425822,5,6302101220,"The first thing that struck me is that Bunuel can do so much with very little. He delivers a very powerful film using one room and no special effects. Thereare no tricks. Everything in this film is about the story and the imagination of the viewer. He has created a film that you can view on several levels. If you choose...you can view this view as an engaging supernatural story. You can also view this as a statement about people and society.

The story is all about society and people's need to conform. In this case people are trapped by what is expected of them and what they see others do. Bunuel's use of the symbolism of sheep really drove the point. Eventually the pressure on the trapped people causes the faade of civilization to crack and break down.",1482019200,,763,4.489208633093525

425824,5,6302101220,"I found this beloved surreal comedy by Bunuel less funny - but more haunting and disturbing - than I expected.  That's not a bad thing.  While there is certainly a mordant wit running thru the film and a few laugh out loud pieces of dialogue or images, its also a melancholy, nightmarish piece about the fact that human beings  even (or especially) the most civilized, the upper classes - are only a twist of fate away from the self-involved savagery that lurks in all human hearts.  That feral quality is always there, driving those who (for example) in Francos Spain subjugated the working classes. But usually those tendencies are buried under the show of societal politeness.  However, when the dinner guests at a rich party find they are mysteriously unable to leave the room, it isn't long before the darkness below their surfaces comes rushing to the fore.

Im surprised by how many people refer to the film as difficult to understand.  Yes, the how of the imprisonment is wonderfully, surreally magical. Nothing blocks the doors or the exits.  Beyond some force within the guests themselves, nothing stops them from leaving  perhaps just as those buried by obsession with wealth and power could throw those things off if they chose to, but never realize they could  so there is a comic mystery to it.  But what happens as these people fall apart in something like an aristocratic, comic and stylized version of Lord of the Flies seems very clear and chilling indeed.  Also the ending, also frequently called confusing, simply seems to indicate that religion is just as much a trap as all the other surface behaviors these folks use top convince themselves they're good.

A wonderfully intelligent and steely eyed look at the darkness of the human soul, somehow successfully accompanied by a playful wink.",1461888000,,1812,4.882352941176471

425827,4,6302101220,"Exterminating Angel might be the most striking film by Bunuel. It is mysterious and bizarre and provocative. There is something to it which makes one say to oneself: ""What does it mean? What does it mean?"" rather than ""Hmmm. Well, I don't get it."" It is like a murder mystery with plenty of clues, though it is hard to figure out what they are telling us. The mood of the film is really well done: exasperating (why can't they leave?!), puzzling, queer, and hostile. The vibe is much less comical or ironic than other Bunuel films, and rather more natural and serious; there is less of a staged feeling and less self-consciousness on the part of the actors. Those interested in the mysteries of human existence, unexplained phenomena, and survival scenarios should give Exterminating Angel a view.",1450310400,,797,4.824817518248175

425862,5,6302101220,"Luis Buuel's 1962 The Exterminating Angel (El Angel exterminador) is without doubt a 5 star film which should belong to every film collection worthy of the name. However, this region 2 Arrow transfer manages to omit a vital scene near the beginning which qualifies any recommendation of the DVD. The scene in question is a repeat shot (from a slightly higher angle) of the guests entering the house for the party while two servants hide waiting to sneak out undetected. It is the first of a series of dj vu tricks which leads logically to the `take two' way that the guests finally leave the house. As such, the cut (even though it's only 10 seconds) is very damaging to the whole structure of the film. I checked out the Criterion region 1 version and sure enough the repeated entry of the guests is there, and what's more the print (even as presented on YouTube) seems much finer than this Arrow release. I would therefore recommend buyers go for the Criterion version especially as it has a second disc full of interesting extras including Gaizka Urresti and Javier Espada's documentary, The Last Script: Remembering Luis Buuel (2008) and interviews with Silvia Pinal. Those who don't possess a region-free DVD player are faced with a Hobson's choice of this Arrow release which has no extras at all. The print is still very good and it is also very cheap, the Criterion version costing 3-4 times as much. Some of you might think it worth going for this cheaper version especially if you see the missing scene on YouTube as I did and know what you are missing. Ideally, Arrow will withdraw this product and re-release it correctly possibly as a duel with a Blu-ray version as well.

The Exterminating Angel has an important place in the Buuel canon. In 1961 the director was on top of the world having picked up the Palme d'Or at Cannes with Viridiana. Persona non grata in Spain thanks to that film's corrosive attack on Catholicism and the Franco regime, he returned to Mexico with producer Gustavo Alatriste and `Mrs. Alatriste', Silvia Pinal. For his next project he opted to go back to his Surrealist routes as essayed in Un Chien Andalou and L'Age d'or. An abrupt change from the melodramatic style of his Mexican films of the 1950s, the film's free-flowing Surrealist style set the pattern for most of his work to come, evidenced most obviously in Belle du Jour, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, The Milky Way and The Phantom of Liberty. These later films made mostly in France are successful but rather mild compared to the best of his Mexican work. None of them are as ferocious, as biting, as corrosive or as wickedly acute as The Exterminating Angel.

An adaptation by Luis Alcoriza (his 10th film for Buuel!) of Jos Bergamn's unfinished play of the same name, The Exterminating Angel (originally titled The Outcasts of Providence Street) is the tale of how a group of rich Bourgeois poseurs return from an evening at the opera (Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor), lead singer and conductor in tow, to the house of Edmundo and Luca de Nobile (Enrique Rambal and Lucy Gallardo) for a grand supper. The meal goes well and the guests relax for a formal soire. But things are far from normal. In the first place, all the servants except for the Majordomo Julio (Claudio Brook) hasten to exit the house as quickly as possible, many of them even before the guests arrive. No reason is given for this, but there is definitely the air of `rats deserting a sinking ship' here as remarked by one of the guests. Then much later instead of going home as social etiquette demands they do, the guests take off their jackets, loosen their gowns and settle down for the night on the couches, chairs and floor of the drawing room. They are all physically able to leave the house, but mentally they are unable to cross the threshold. Again Buuel gives no reason for the psychological barrier. The barrier proves to be formidable, lasting for several days (possibly even a month as alluded to by another guest - the precise time is actually never specified) and it proves to be two way. The guests can't exit and people on the street can't enter either. Trapped together in the drawing room, people's patience begins to run thin (some are obviously impatient from the very beginning) and as the food and water run out, the once `glorious' and `noble' members of lite high society are reduced to the state of squalid filthy animals arguing and attacking each other, gnawing at bones and scrabbling degenerate-like on the detritus-strewn floor for any crumb that will render sustenance. If anything, the state to which they are reduced is worse than anything Buuel depicted in his earlier social-realist films like Los Olvidados or El Bruto.

In total one could say that all of Buuel's films amount to a cleansing of our perceptions and an explosion of the repressive stupidities of convention and ritual. Buuel hated all cultural rituals which repress people's natural emotions and his films are full of eruptions stemming from this repression. In Nazarn and Viridiana he had attacked the organized religion of the Catholic Church, the first of Buuel's arch-repressors. In The Exterminating Angel it is the Bourgeoisie that comes under fire though the Church is still a part of it. The film constitutes a merciless assault on the hypocrisy of middle class arrogance and self-centeredness. The Bourgeoisie and the values they upheld were intolerable to Buuel and in this film he lets rip in a violent way which was never to be repeated.

In the film Buuel goes to great lengths to deliberately obfuscate meaning and the Surrealist style dictates that no one reading of the work actual explains away everything we see. Nevertheless, the director positively goads us into reaching out for meanings all the way through. One possible key to understanding the film lies at the start of the supper when the host Nobile proposes a toast to the lead singer and conductor of the opera they have just seen. Everyone responds as etiquette requires by raising their glasses. Immediately (echoing the dj vu repeat entry of the guests not seen on this DVD!), Nobile repeats the toast but is ignored. He stutters into silence as the camera pans down the table showing the bored indolent apathetic faces of the members of the Bourgeoisie which Buuel is about to lay into. At the bottom of the table a career army officer scandalizes a lady by refuting patriotism and saying his country (and I think we should infer Spain here rather than Mexico) is disappearing into the sea thanks to its many rivers - the sea is a Jungian symbol for death. It's as if Buuel first gives the surface, the social veneer that the Bourgeoisie exudes, but then in the blink of an eye he gives us the reality. The following arc of the film's narrative shows that rottenness isn't a state that the Bourgeoisie regresses into. Rather, it is something that is an integral part of their nature from the beginning. The veneer of high `civilization' is simply a faade maintained to keep up appearances which represses any real emotion. Buuel later used the dinner table setting to attack the middle class most conspicuously in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and in The Phantom of Liberty which has dinner guests sitting on toilet seats around the table. These scenes are agreeably amusing, but they lack the cutting cynicism of the present film. The hostess has arranged a `joke' for the amusement of the guests by deliberately tripping up a waiter while he's carrying a loaded tray. There is not a drop of humanity in the way the guests laugh at the misfortune of this member of the working class. One guest, a Mr. Russell (Antonio Bravo) doesn't have a sense of humor and the hostess is obliged to cancel a second bizarre joke which would have included letting loose a bear and a flock of sheep on the room. A command of Spanish is needed to get all the nuances of the table conversation and the talk that follows in the soire, but it's obvious that everyone hates each other and merely pay lip-service to social conventions. Smiles hide inner feelings of aggression and back-stabbing treachery. A gaggle of women comment about a foreign lady, Leticia (Silvia Pinal) who is nicknamed `the Valkyrie' because she treasures her virginity with warrior-like ice maiden intensity - they call her virginity `a perversion'. Leticia may possibly notice the attack and hurls an ash-tray (?) through a window breaking the glass. Another guest comments, ""Oh, it's just a passing Jew"". The casual callousness of the crowd is revealed in various conversation asides. One woman describes the horror of witnessing a train derailment where she sees poor people squished up `like a concertina' in a crushed carriage. Her ghoulish friends lean forward with interest to hear the dripping details and she says she wasn't shocked at all, the horror not comparing to the experience of a celebrity funeral (a mere social occasion) where she feinted with emotion. Another guest says quite sincerely, ""I think the lower classes are immune to pain"".

The social etiquette of haute-Bourgeois behavior is paid lip-service to all the way through the film. Guests realize they should all go home, but they don't. They shouldn't take off their dinner jackets or loosen their gowns, but they do. `Ladies first' should be observed at all times, but it isn't. As the situation becomes increasingly desperate, the behavior becomes increasingly despicable. One man has lost his pills to treat a serious malady only for another to find the medication and spitefully throw it away. When they are forced to break open a pipe in the wall, the guests fight for water like dogs, women being thrust aside by the selfish men. The only guest to retain any kind of `civilized' morality is Dr. Conde (Augusto Benedico) who tends a sick man to death (Mr. Russell - does Buuel punish him for not having a sense of humor?) and casts around for possible drugs. Nobile reveals his secret stash of `social' morphine which he donates to the doctor, but is then stolen by the selfish Francisco Avila (Xavier Loy) and his protective sister Juana (Ofelia Guilmin) who seem to be incestuously attached (another Wagner reference along with the Valkyrie) and who want the drug just for their own pleasure. The character of Francisco is particularly unpleasant. High strung and super-sensitive he can't stand the tiny infringements of Bourgeois behavior like a woman combing her hair and is vicious in his verbal attacks saying another woman `stinks like a hyena'. In her essay for Cineaste magazine Karen Backstein has drawn attention to the way the film resembles the Jean-Paul Sartre existentialist play Huis Clos (No Exit) which confines three characters to a room. They eventually discover their destiny is to remain cooped up there forever, torturing each other through eternity. Perhaps for Buuel as well as Sartre, Hell is to be with other people and when the sheep are baked on fires which smoke out the room, Hell is absolutely the right word to describe the mise-en-scne. In the end everything boils down to the vicious mob rounding on Nobile, blaming him for having invited them to the party. They demand his sacrifice and just before he is forced to oblige them, Leticia comes up with her ingenious idea for their escape. Throughout all this it's important to realize that what we see in the film is not a systematic destruction of civilization (that would admit the Bourgeoisie were civilized in the first place), but a revealing of the real nature of this `civilization'. The Bourgeois idea of civilization is simply a huge faade, a pretense which represses real emotions and prevents people from expressing themselves naturally. This is the sinking ship of apathy which the servants desert at the beginning of the film and herein lays the film's radical social assault.

Above matters of plot and characters, it's noticeable how Buuel pin-points and lacerates each belief system that members of the Bourgeoisie cling to. During the piano recital and in conversation references are made to Freemasonry, a middle class claque devoted to self-service and self-promotion among the secret members which in the end proves useless. Then there is talk of cabbala, a Jewish belief system referencing the occult which some of the members present resort to in order to affect an escape, but which again fails. Most obviously of all there is the Roman Catholic Church which frames the film and is a constant presence throughout. The opening credits roll over the front of a cathedral and the incantation of Catholic plainsong. Very obvious is the way Buuel has pictures of various saints of the Catholic Church hung on the wall of the drawing room. They look down and observe the cruel behavior of the humans for which they (according to Buuel) are responsible. Deliciously ironic is the way the pictures hang on doors which lead into cupboards in which guests relieve themselves in vases, have sex, or kill themselves. The couple committing suicide is a particularly blatant blasphemy as suicide is forbidden by the Catholic Church. The film closes with the guests observing their Te Deum at the cathedral in thanks to God for delivering them. After the film's vicious condemnation of their scandalous behavior we cannot avoid wagging our fingers at the hypocrites as the camera pans along them more like they are the accused at a trial than the congregation at a church service. Then we see the hypocrisy extend to the priests as well, for they cannot leave the premises. The bishop suggests they let the congregation leave first, but of course, they too cannot leave. The psychological barrier once again has gone up. Interestingly, Buuel is careful to erase the people we have been looking at the whole film, emphasizing that his depiction of apathetic middle class hypocrisy extends beyond the walls of exclusive drawing rooms of obviously rich landowners to include everyone else as well. The Church is culpable as a pillar of Bourgeois hypocrisy, and its leaders are left stranded with their congregation in the cathedral as revolution breaks out on the streets. Here we return to the political critique (of Franco's Spain?) suggested at the film's outset - it is the exodus of the servants that perhaps strands the middle class in their apathy for without the working class the middle class cannot function. And without the middle class the working class is easily led to rebellion and it's to the sound of machine gun fire as the military savagely put the rebellion down that the film ends.

Wickedly funny and devastatingly pungent in its laceration of the hypocrisy of Bourgeois values and behavior, The Exterminating Angel is a staggering achievement. Gabriel Figueroa's camerawork transcends the difficulties of shooting in just the one location with consummate ease, the few cutaways to street scenes outside the front of the house pointed in their effect. The acting (with few well known names outside of Pinal in the cast) is superb and Buuel's direction is as pointed and as beautifully nuanced as ever. The wonderful title by the way refers to the Bible, 2 Samuel 24:16, where God sends an angel to punish David. `And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, it is enough'. The exterminating angel is referenced only once in the film by Mr. Russell as he dies saying, ""...I'm spared the angel"". Obviously Buuel wanted the angel to exterminate everyone thoroughly in this film later saying in his autobiography My Last Breath, that he regretted the guests not being reduced to cannibalism at the end. Now that really would have been something! A marvelous film which you will need to see a number of times, it's a mandatory purchase.

425895,5,6302101220,"Made in 1962, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL is a highly complex film to
watch, despite is ostensibly straightforward story. A group of rich
people gather together in a large house for a party, but find
themselves unable to escape. Deprived of their basic comforts such as
food, water and clothing, they are transformed into savages. Outside
the building, people look on in astonishment; while being concerned for
the welfare of those trapped inside, they make no efforts to help.
Bunuel's film can be seen as an allegory of contemporary society, in
which the veneer of civilization is highly superficial. Rich people,
just like their less privileged counterparts, are unable to find ways
of extricating themselves from difficult situations. Even though they
escape at the end, they are subsequently imprisoned in the church:
Bunuel shows that nobody, not even established institutions, can help
them (or us, for that matter). The film ends with a flock of sheep
running towards the church where the people are imprisoned, suggesting
that human beings are like lambs to the slaughter. The only way to cope
with this inevitable fate is to trust in Providence; hence it comes as
no surprise to find the action taking place in Providence Street. THE
EXTERMINATING ANGEL needs to be viewed more than once in order to
appreciate the subtlety of Bunuel's script, as well as the brilliance
of his cinematic technique, but it is well worth the effort.",1373932800,2,1436,5.03781512605042
425896,2,6302101220,"The Arrow Films edition of ""Exterminating Angel"" is advertised as an ""all region"" DVD under ""Product Details"" and I bought it as such, expecting that it could be played in the USA since that is what it states.  However, when inserted the DVD gives an error message stating ""This DVD cannot be played.  Playback prohibit[ed] by area limitations."" What is the deceit?  The advertisement simply contradicts its first claim later on, stating under ""Product Description"":

""United Kingdom released, PAL/Region 0 DVD: it WILL NOT play on standard US DVD player. You need multi-region PAL/NTSC DVD player to view it in USA/Canada.""

So, this DVD plays in all regions provided you have an all-region DVD player.  You may wish to buy the pricier Criterion Collection instead.  Now to the film itself.

Oft described as a ""surrealist"" masterpiece, ""Exterminating Angel"" follows a party attended by upper class bourgeois whose members for seemingly mysterious reasons all find themselves unable to depart.  At first they rationalize their impotence as a variety of choices, but quickly their behavior degenerates over the course of several days' captivity into the expression of the basest and most primitive of instincts.  Even more miraculously, the police, the military, and the social leaders not trapped with them are pathetically unable to intervene on their behalf as though all were trapped in a bizarre fugue state, somehow frozen in amber, paralyzed in a dream.

The natural association is to Buuel's later classic, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,"" which also examines the ruling class's relation to convention, but there is a profound and crucial but little noticed difference that reflects Buuel's greater understanding of his subject as he matured.  Replay the moment in ""Exterming Angel"" that releases the party from captivity: the magic words that undo the entire spell are nothing more than a social banality - one which the host had inadvertently failed to utter the night before - and the utterance of which liberates all of them to do as they wish.  In ""Exterminating Angel"" the upper class is still the slave of convention.  By contrast, in ""Discreet Charm"" the ruling elite are revealed as open predators - murderers, drug dealers, seducers of their best friends' wives - disguised only by the mask of convention that from time-to-time they find it prudent to assume.  The rulers are here the masters of convention and use it as a tool to deceive others in order to advance their own selfish ends. Would that this change reflected Buuel's growing cynicism, but alas it reflects his utter realism, a realism that Plato so fruitfully explored in The Republic.",1364515200,5,2675,5.117241379310345

425899,5,6302101220,"Since I don't boast a degree in psychology, my summing up of Luis Buuel's freaky THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL pretty much goes like so: damn, what an odd movie. Definitely art-house and subject to provocative interpretations. Is it a damning allegory of the privileged class? Absolutely. Is it Buuel's contempt for the idle rich manifesting? Looks like it. Bottom line is that I love how off left field it is, how strange it is, and how it quickly takes on aspects of The Twilight Zone. It is subversive and absurd. Scenes repeat themselves, some more obvious than others, and contribute to a dreamlike quality that suffuses the screen.

Irony, thou resides on Calle de la Providencia. On that street, a group of guests congregates to attend a dinner party. Later, they find themselves unable to leave the drawing room, trapped there inexplicably by their own inertia. As time elapses, the group's initial besument deteriorates into appalling social disorder. It's like LORD OF THE FLIES but with fancy napkins.

I like THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL for its unique title and for its blend of black comedy and surrealism. A sense of creeping horror sneaks up on the viewer as days elapse in the film and the guests remain unable to find egress. Claustrophobia sets in. Food and water quickly run out. Interactions among the guests grow increasingly vicious. A foul odor begins to permeate the drawing room. Outside, the smell reaches those a street away. The physician in the group - and lucky the group is to have him - is one of the few to keep a level head. He cautions: ""Only by dispassionate analysis can we get to the bottom of our inaction.""

Some years ago I got stuck for hours in an elevator with someone, and, by the time I got out, I was ready to strangle the guy. Unexplainable forces aside, the events that transpire in that drawing room make an appalling sort of sense in how they unfold as people's psyches break down. And then three sheep and a bear wander in. Make of that what you will.

 No one could throw a party on the screen like Don Luis Bunuel did - in his films people just can't get enough of the parties - they either can't get started (""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"") or they are so sumptuous that the guests would never leave - in a perfect companion piece to the Discreet Charm.., ""The Exterminating Angel"" (1962), very funny comedy with very dark (as usual for Bunuel) humor. The funniest part is that nobody forces the guests to stay, nobody holds a gun to their heads or blackmails them. They just don't have a willpower to open the door and go outside where the police, family members, and press are waiting...not be able to make few steps to the party house and open the door from outside....

Once again Bunuel proves that he is one of just a few artists who could tell the same joke over and over again and get away with it creating the film as perplexing, absurdist, bizarre and in the same time irresistibly funny and clever as ""The Exterminating Angel"".

And instead of taking place on an island, it took place at an estate.  This film could've been great if it had done either one of two things:  (1) Develop the characters more.  Unlike LORD OF THE FLIES, I could not understand any of the characters as I did with Ralph, Piggy, Simon, et. al.  Because of this, I did not think THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL did a very good job examining the human condition.  (2) Make it funny!  If you're not going to take this film seriously and develop the characters, then at least give the audience something to laugh at.  I didn't think the characters in THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE were that well developed either.  But it was laugh-out-loud funny!

425903,4,6302101220,"""The Exterminating Angel"" concerns a group of sophisticated, careerist members of the haute bourgeoisie, who have presumably just been to the opera, and are now attending the after-party at a luxurious mansion, where aprs-diner find themselves mysteriously trapped in a swanky living room.  The film itself is a metaphor for those who are suffocated by their association with professional and religious institutions.  As we learn before the end of the film, those who conform to the rules, consciously or otherwise -- Will pay a heavy price.  The message of this picture is plain: Buuel is telling the viewer to ""Beware the Dangers of Conventionality"".  ""Exterminating Angel"" contains elements dating back to Buuel's roots in Surrealism; i.e. ""The Bear"" represents all that is wild and savage; the ""Flocks of Sheep"" stand in as metaphors for ""the pious / the followers"" ..... Noteworthy as well are The Hand of the Dead Man, the Feverish Dreams of certain Exhausted Partygoers and Occasional Nonsensical Dialogue among the Guests.  Yet despite frequent touches of Buuel's humor, the atmosphere of this film more closely resembles ""The Twilight Zone"", albeit a TZ with softer edges.  The party guests struggle to retain their dignity in a scenario that is alternately mundane and sinister.  ""The Doctor"" represents ""The Voice of Reason""; he makes ongoing attempts to keep this group from hurling themselves into a downward spiral.

As for the supplemental material on CD 2, the interviews with both Silvia Pinal (she relates how she often discussed ""Exterminating Angel"" with Buuel while acting in the film; she comes across and genuine and sincere) and director Arturo Ripstein are very good.  However, the documentary, ""The Last Script: Remembering Luis Buuel"" (2008), featuring Buuel's son, director Juan Luis Buuel and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrire, is far too long.  Although I have great respect for Mr. Buuel, the documentary's various cast members go on and on -- ad infinitum, ad nauseum -- sycophantically waxing poetic about Buuel's greatness.  Half an hour could easily have been edited out of this 90 minute documentary.  I have to think that Buuel himself would have been against that kind of self-promotional adoration, even when directed towards him.  However, ""Last Script: Remembering Luis Buuel"" does have its highlights, including black and white stills taken by Buuel, and the following quote by Carrire: ""Buuel had a Comic / Spanish Obsession with Death"".

425904,4,6302101220,"The late Luis Bunuel was a famous surrealist film director. You can find his name in most dictionaries. After seeing awful Mexican movies made in the 1980's and 1990's, it was a treat to see The Exterminating Angel(1962). Although, Bunuel was Spanish. The title ""The Exterminating Angel"" sounds like something from an action-exploitation film. Several rich people(played by Lucy Gallardo, Jacqueline Andere, Ofelia Montesco, Claudio Brook, Bertha Moss, Patricia Moran, etc.) are trapped in a mansion during a storm. Without help from their servants, they're unable to obtain fresh water or food. They're unable to clean up their filth or get medical attention. Luis Bunuel adds a bunch of deja vu scenes(such as the rich people entering a room twice) and he's honest about the plot holes. There's also surreal, dream-like scenes of sheep and a bear loitering around the mansion and a church.
 Jacqueline Andere looks so sensual and young in this film. In 1962, she had a big, pointy nose. In recent years, she's had cosmetic surgery to make it smaller! Andere is a good actress and her femininity is appealing. I like scenes where people hurt her and she'll burst into tears! Lucy Gallardo is in this film. She played Jose Jose's mother in Buscando Una Sonrisa/In Search of a Smile(1971). Bertha Moss and Patricia Moran later appeared in Romeo Contra Julieta(1968). The late Ofelia Montesco was one of the hottest women that ever lived! Her dark, sensual looks were eye candy! This Criterion DVD delivers in quality and quantity. The film's trailer and a Luis Bunuel documentary are extra features. The Exterminating Angel(1962) is a solid, surreal, art-house film.",1287273600,2,1665,5.0989010989010985
425955,4,6302101220,"""The Exterminating Angel"" (1962) is directed by Luis Bunuel (Viridiana, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie). The movie takes place at a dinner party with the people discovering that they are unable to leave the house for some unknown reason. As time passes they are reduced to ever more base states and superstitious acts, some even committing suicide. Bunuel mocks social conventions and religion by showing how fear and desperation spawns believes in false myths and fetishes as revealed by the Kabbalah, chicken feet, a washable rubber virgin, as well as Masonic codes and rituals of human sacrifice. He also shows how religion provides justification for some of the worst injustices of the bourgeois social order. The movie though reveals that the failure of the will of the people in this room is no more mysterious than what prevents citizens from changing their own corrupt economic, social and political systems on which their own privileges are based. In the end it is an absurd communal ""faith"" that releases the guests as the people are able to exit from the room by repeating the sequence of events that took place before they became trapped. Thus mass, mindless repetition and ritual is shown as how people create the illusion of breaking free and having control over their lives even though all along they are only trapped by their own false beliefs.

This is a double disc DVD set with a restored high definition digital transfer on one disc and various features on the other, including a 2008 documentary featuring the Bunuel and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere as well as interviews with actress Silvia Pinal and  filmmaker Arturo Ripstein.

425956,5,6302101220,"The sound of a tolling church bell prefaces the bizarre events that are to unfold at a Mexican estate on Providence Street. An aristocrat appropriately named Nobile (Enrique Rambal) has invited several society friends to his home after the opera. But even as the dinner preparations are underway, the servants feel an inexplicable urge to depart from the premises. Despite the threat of dismissal, an anxious footman, Lucas (Angel Merino), is the first to leave. As the guests arrive and ascend the stairs to deposit their overcoats for the evening, two more servants attempt to escape, only to turn back when the guests emerge from the room. Or do they? Curiously, the entrance scene of the guests is repeated from a higher camera angle, and this time, the servants successfully escape.

The dinner is a great success. The hours pass. The people yawn and stretch out in exhaustion, yet no one leaves. Despite the mutual realization of the guests that they have clearly overstayed their welcome, no one wants to bear the distinction of being the first person to leave the dinner party. The veneer of civility erodes as desperation and distrust set in, and inevitably, the guests turn against their accommodating host, blaming him for their absurd, self-induced captivity.

Luis Buuel uses sardonic humor and surrealist imagery as instruments of social indictment in The Exterminating Angel. In a culture defined by etiquette instead of humanity, Buuel exposes the underlying artifice and hypocrisy of civilized society. In essence, it is the burden of the guests to perform the meaningless, Sisyphean rituals dictated by their privileged class: the repetitive introductions, the polite acceptance of social invitations, and the perpetuation of self-indulgent dinner parties. However, it is also the passive comfort of their social status that creates their claustrophobic isolation and complacent inertia. Stripped of their pretense, their innate behavior remains fundamentally instinctual, base, and primal. Ironically, it is a return to the ritual that liberates them from their artificial prison. The Exterminating Angel is a mesmerizing, richly symbolic, allegorical tale on the nature of human behavior: of masters and servants, of excess and want, and of fraternity and alienation.",1265587200,3,2287,5.385474860335195

The Exterminating Angel ($39.95; Criterion) is one of the surreal provocateur's most accessible works, the amusingly scathing (as opposed to tiresomely scathing, which is where I often find Bunuel resides) look at the upper class by showing a dinner party where the guests simply can't leave. It's like a Voltaire take on Twilight Zone, with this simple premise taken to its logical extreme. The film looks great and extras include a substantial documentary from 2008 featuring arguably the greatest screenwriter (and certainly the greatest adapter) of all time, Jean-Claude Carriere among others, plus some other new interviews. But that's one of his most famous titles. Who but Criterion would also put out Simon Of The Desert ($24.95; Criterion),a 45 minute short about a prophet who camps out on a pillar for six years, six months and six days to show his devotion to G-d only to be sorely tempted by the devil.

425959,5,6302101220,"Althought some critics consider ""The Exterminating Angel"" as a lesser work in the extraordinary filmography made by Luis Buuel in Mexico, the film represents one of the greatest moments of the mexican cinematography. Made under the difficult circumstances surrounding the dawn of Mexican Film Industry's Golden Age, ""The Exterminating Angel"" was the very last feature-lenght film made by Buuel in Mexico before his last (and spectacular) French stage that includes films like ""Belle de jour"" and ""That Obscure Object of Desire"".

Criterion Collection has given ""The Exterminating Angel"" the treatment of a true masterpiece. Not only the sound and image qualities are superb, but the movie includes the complete version of a scene that was ""edited"" in many copies of ""The Exterminating Angel"" that were shown from the 1970s to 1990s. The ""edited"" version (apparently cut by producer Gustavo Alatriste himself) eliminated the double entrance of the Nobiles and their guests to the dinner party, at the beginning of the film. That repeated action set the tone of the entire film, in which repetitions and coincidences are very important, but can be easily (and wrongly) taken as an continuity error, not as a surreal joke of the great Buuel.

Disc 2 includes a new documentary (Remembering Luis Buuel) featuring screenwriter and Buuel's friend Jean-Claude Carrire, and director Juan Luis Buuel, the son of ""The Genius of Calanda"", that is a great adition to the many other documentaries made about this great spanish-mexican director.",1245283200,4,1531,5.296296296296297
425960,5,6302101220,"One of the most bizarre, yet extremely powerful films I've ever seen, `El Angel Exterminador' is a fantastic example of the artistic side of cinema.  Controversial director Luis Bunuel delivers a tasty treat here; an abstract and macabre satire that is poignant even today in analyzing our modern society.

The film's prose is quite simple.  A group of socialites get together after an Opera at a friends home for refreshments.  For some reason the help has decided to leave the house, leaving these very dependant individuals to fend for themselves.  As the night presses on it becomes apparent that no one is planning on leaving, and soon hours turn into days and these seemingly intelligent men and women are stuck in an open room, willingly refusing to leave yet not fully understanding why they are still there.  The media goes into a frenzy yet no one is willing to enter the home, not for lack of trying.

For me, this was a brilliant take on societies growing lethargy.  True, Bunuel was targeting the `upper-crust' of the time if you will, but his interpretation of their situation is very poignant for today's Americana.  We live in a society where people grow accustomed to being cared for, plain and simple.  It is no longer an issue of wealth as portrayed here though; people in general have become lazy.  No one wants to work for a living anymore, and the ones that do work feel as though they are owed special penance for doing such.  We cannot function without our cellular phones and our e-mail and our high-speed internet.  We are not self sufficient, and Bunuel brilliantly depicts the downfall to such dependency.  These `rich folk' could not function without their servants.  They couldn't even walk into the kitchen and make a meal.  In fact, they were reduced to savagery, waiting for their meal to come to them.  Today we find ourselves paralyzed if we lose power, if only for an hour.

Bunuel's masterpiece was truly ahead of its time, for it presented to the audience a very realistic depiction of our current state of affairs.

The performances by the cast are all strong, if not unimportant.  Everyone is solid, no one stands out, and that is really how it should be.  This is not a story about any particular individual but about a growing crisis within humankind.  Thus, having each character somewhat melt into the next adds layers to the films statement that individuality is lost within our abrasive apathy.  We are all essentially the same when we lose the power to decide for ourselves.

Some will not get this film, and you may be one of them, so don't feel so bad if you walk away hating this movie.  It is bizarre and completely unlike anything you've ever witnessed before, and at times the film can see overly ambitious or deliberately `art house', which I know a lot of people have a problem with; but honestly, nothing about this film is anything short of blatant honesty.  I for one am impressed with Bunuel's vision, and his delivery (the same ambiguous delivery I faulted `Belle de Jour' for works marvelously here) is nothing short of appropriate and unforgettable.",1241049600,5,3111,4.757462686567164

Something is dreadfully wrong with the soundtrack -- it is very unpleasant to listen to and sounds as though it was digitally sampled and then re-processed at an incompatible bit-rate. Consequently there is a constant in and out between too loud (and distorted) and virtually silent. The same thing is true of the Criterion ""Honeymoon Killers,"" of which there is a version available in France that has a perfectly great sounding track. I don't know why such problems surface with our ""premium"" DVD producer. In any case, paying top dollar for such a technical disaster seems quite unjust.",1239062400,11,655,5.074074074074074

Something, some unexplainable force is keeping them from going through the doorway to another room.  There is no apparent rhyme or reason for their inability to leave, and that's what draws us in.  What's going on?  Why are these people behaving so?  We wait and we wonder as days go by and the situation becomes more desperate.  The police have assembled outside but they, too, appear immobile and unable to enter.
 The premise is simple, but Bunuel milks its possibilities as he escalates the surrealistic drama.  The film's restored, high-definition digital transfer looks terrific and is in keeping with Criterion's high standard.

425964,5,6302101220,"This is a masterpiece dealing with the role of rules and manners as vestments of identity and superiority and what happens when they disintegrate.  Like William Golding's Lord of the Flies, it deals with how human beings behave in the face of the breakdown of order, but it does so to the powerful.

The subjects are the mid 20th century European bourgeoisie and the situation - a grand dinner, the perfect arena for the display of rules and manners adopted by the ruling classes. The guests here are not children stranded on a desert island with no adults to tell them what to do - but they might as well be, as the fact of their inability to leave the dining room starts to eat away at their carefully crafted rules of behaviour.

Like a disaster movie - even comic parodies of disaster movies - different characters react in different ways, and different people break down in different ways, as their 'civilisation' is stripped away from them. There are no singing nuns, but there is a cheery encourager, a hysterical male who loses it and a moody reflective who almost enjoys accepting her terrible fate.

Bunuel's favourite targets were the bourgeoisie and organised religion in the form of the Catholic Church. He gleefully lifts the curtain on their pomposity and superiority to reveal the venal human beings behind the facade. Exterminating Angel is an excellent example of this 'Emperor's New Clothes' treatment and is my personal favourite.

The surreal device of the inability to leave the table is amusing, but its real job is to illustrate, at a point where the panoply of bourgeois manners come together - at the dinner table - what happens when they are slowly stripped away.

Times may change and the relevance of those particular targets may come and go, but you can swap in any powerful institution or group in any society and this treatment would still apply. That is what makes these films still relevant and appealing and this universality makes Bunuel one of history's great illustrators of the human soul.",1218672000,2,2028,4.813218390804598

425997,5,6302101220,"Luis Bunuel is a filmmaker whose work, although it is of such magnitude and weight that I among many believe it will never go out of style as long as the media exists, has, since his death, somewhat languished.  He had the misfortune of dying at the wrong time.  Fascism was on the rise worldwide. Reagan had ascended to the American presidency. `Liberal' had become a `dirty' word.  The complexion of the general film going public had changed and drifted considerably to the mindless right.  Art houses no longer catered to themes of the radical left - and what, with rock-stars voting Republican, material girls and retro in, even the underground seemed drifting, however mindfully, somewhat right.  Good ol' in your face Marxism - staple of Bunuel's themes - was out of fashion.

All that now has changed. The `cat-house' atmosphere of the 80's and 90's has vanished in the realization of the many who never got a taste, or got but a taste, of the promised trickle, or that elusive dot.com success, that we are living in a corporate/fascist police state ruled by a brutal, insensitive, fattened bourgeois elite and fueled by insane theocratic/fundamentalist paranoia and blind greed.  The root of which is brilliantly articulated and displayed in Bunuel's many diverse and visionary works.  That point tells: for me, ironically, what makes these films as great as they are, is that in his literal pounding out of these themes, utilizing the graphic capacity of film as few have ever have, Bunuel enters into a mystical realm, in which he speaks of things so basic to the human predicament or situation, that beyond the humor or the horror, we feel them, and must admit our participation in them.

I don't know which is Bunuel's greatest - maybe Viridiana - maybe The Exterminating Angel.  The films he made with Sylvia Pinal are extraordinary, but those he made with Deneuve and Moreau aren't too shoddy either.  And let us not forget the masterworks of his twilight years, The Obscure Object of Desire and The Phantom of Liberty.  Or earlier works, like Simon of the Desert . . . That plaudit  I cannot give to one, as a number of the reviewers here do.  But I cannot object - The Exterminating Angel is one of the masterpieces of cinema, drama, what have you - and although imitated and emulated, never quite equaled.

I hope that the generation coming of age now, in Bush's America and around the world, especially in the Mid-East don't forget to take in a Bunuel flick or two, and one can do no better than his one horror film, The Exterminating Angel.  Contrasted with today's high- budget blood and gore horror extravaganzas, there are no special effects, the pace, characteristically, is crawlingly slow, deliberate (which may account for the negative reactions on this page).  Fear not, you will not forget it.  The problem analyzed here is similar to but runs much deeper than what's being discussed in a comparable classic, Todd Browning's `Freaks'.  What's being discussed is the force inherent in convention which stands as the basis of community.  Are we willingly members of a community, or are we impelled by certain enforced necessity?  The phony affectations which we assume as permanent masks - the way we habitually, and then traditionally, hide our true feelings and intentions from the public gaze - these Bunuel sees neuroses symptomatic of an essential dishonesty which pervades our social relations.  The guests want to leave this party (which is at the least a bore, and at the worst, uncomfortable) but as they try to exit, at first gracefully, and then desperately, they are met at the door by a mysterious force field which will not let them leave. They must return and face their destinies. The rest is, beyond all the lies, history, in all its real terror.",1160870400,8,3789,4.841860465116279

Reading the reviews for this film was much enjoyable than actually watching the film itself. If you want to watch a good Bunuel film, go for Los Olvidados instead.",1150675200,12,791,4.331081081081081
426000,2,6302101220,"Luis Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel"", to put briefly, is about a dinner party in which afterwards, the guest will not leave. They sit and relax, take off their coats, lay down on the sofa, talk among each other. But no one makes an effort to leave. The guest realize what is going on. They are even puzzled by it, but no one walks out the door. This continues for over an hour and 30 minutes.

 That story may sound boring, and it is, but this is coming from a man who also made a movie about a group of people who get together, several times, to eat a meal, but at the last moment something always stops them.

 Bunuel's career constisted mainly of making films where he riduculed the upper class and religion. The other film I described was called ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"". Its very title is an insult. It was followed by a sequel ""The Phantom of Liberty"", which I prefer.

 ""The Exterminating Angel"" is also an attack on the bourgeoisie. The film shows us these rich, ""important"", successful people, who pretend to be superior to all others, yet, when they are confined to the one room, they become animals. They hunt for food and water, fight with each other, and some even die.

 But the biggest problem I had with this movie is the fact it bored the heck out of me. I understand what Bunuel is doing. I get the point of the film. But I simply do not care. The movie would have worked better as a short. The film just takes this one note idea, and in my opinion, never took it to the next level. Nothing really happens. I was not shocked or surprised. I could clearly see what was going on.

 Bunuel has made better films. Films where he gets his ideas across in a much more intertaining and more importantly, humorous way. ""The Discreet Charm...ect"" and ""The Phantom of Liberty"" are two examples. Also check out ""Belle de jour"". All three films attack the upper class and religion, but succeed in entertaining us. Bunuel's ideas jell better.

 I'm sure some people will get very mad at me for not calling this a masterpiece. They'll claim, I don't like it because I don't understand what Bunuel is doing. That's not the case. I do understand but do not care. I was not impressed. Bunuel doesn't take this idea to the fullest. It just seems stuck in first gear. I'm telling you, Bunuel has made better films.

 Bottom-line: Interesting idea from Luis Bunuel, that ultimately doesn't go far enough. I was actually bored. Bunuel's ideas on the upper class and religion have been expressed better in other films. I never cared about the characters or the situation, only when the movie would end.",1150416000,22,2616,4.514830508474576
426001,4,6302101220,"Imagine, if you will, a group of wealthy Spanish aristocrats arriving at a mansion, having just attended an opera. As they arrive, the servants, well paid and happy with their jobs slip out, one by one. They are needed to attend the guests for the evening, but they just feel a strange compulsion to leave.

The party continues, more or less without incident: some sneaky affairs, some gossip, some conspiring among Freemasons. You know, the usual. The night drags on...and on...and on, but no one leaves the lounge. Some of the guests politely ask to be excused as they have plans the next day, but it isn't long before they find themselves back in the fold of the party, conversing as though nothing was amiss. The host offers the guests prepared bedrooms. Some accept, some don't. But by the ed of the night, everyone in the house except the loyal butler is asleep in the crowded lounge.

The next morning, the guests awake in confusion. Why did they stay the night? They hadn't planned on it. Several guests conclude to put an end to the absurdness and walk toward the door as the butler enters with breakfast. They decide it wouldn't hurt to stay just a little longer.

Things seem to getting very unusual, to say the least. The hostess tells the butler to get spoons to stir the coffee, but when he approaches the door, he freezes in fear.

No one can leave the room!

Why? Because...they just can't! ""The only explanation is that it lacks explanation.""

Things get more and more desperate as the days limp by and the food runs out. More people grow ill, others grow violent, others kill themselves or simply die.

This is one of the last films of cinematic pioneer Luis Bunuel, whose Un Chien Andalou invented surrealist filmmaking. Unlike Andalou, though, this is a film more about plot and character than about cheap shocks. Is this a better film, though? I don't think so. While it certainly is a functioning thriller and a terrificly profound concept, it doesn't have the same energy or visual invention, and I disliked the ending. The only thing that would've made it complete would be a character's shrug as he says ""Here we go again!""

Still, most of the film is truly chilling in its portayal of realism in an absurd situation. I suggest that any fans of weirdness give this one a looking over.",1131062400,6,2309,4.642156862745098
426002,5,6302101220,"If you think it carefully, this movie might be considered as the seminal seed of The discrete charming of the bourgeosie. The mental incapacity to take decisions conceived as decay state, twilight creative, accustomed frivolity, amazing triviality (understood as the lack of physical tensions), and existential laziness are shown through a acid fable inspired in the Surrealistic airs enrooted in the great tradition of Beaumarchais and Voltaire.

It tells the story of guests invited to a sumptuous dinner party who find they are unable to leave at the end of the soire. An enigmatic and undecipherable force compels them to stay in such reduced space. And the previous and kind ambit gradually becomes a hellish place: they will know about thirst, hunger, boredom, fear and the arousing of the hidden demons will appear in the middle of this unbearable tension.

A merciless and bitter film, but also a penetrating and overflowing reflection about the human nature, that will remind that cynical and terrific Bernard Saw 's statement:
 "" Perpetual vacations: here you have a very close definition about what hell means.""",1127174400,5,1122,5.1878453038674035
426003,4,6302101220,"The first thing you should know about ""The exterminating angel"" is that its director, Luis Buuel (1900-1983), is a Surrealist. As such, he loved the idea of surprising his public, of bringing viewers to awareness by surprising them. That being the case, you shouldn't be surprised if you find some very strange scenes that will make you wonder ""what was he thinking?"" :)

The plot of this film is simple. There is a dinner party, and the guest belong to the upper classes. Everything is perfect, but there is only a butler. All the other servants fled the premises, feeling that something wasn't right. As the party comes to an end, the guest realise that they cannot leave the house. At first, they don't worry too much, and everybody is pretty much the same. However, and hours pass by, and they ran out of food and water, tempers explode and manners deteriorate, showing that even the most polite person can go to extremes in certain conditions.

The ending is quite surprising, and the movie worthwhile watching. Buuel said that ""The real purpose of Surrealism is to explode the social order, to transform life itself"", and he tried to do that with his films. In my opinion, ""The Exterminating Angel"" was Buuel's way of criticizing the differences between classes, and a study of human behaviour at its worst. Of course, that is merely my interpretation. Watch this film and find yours...

426004,5,6302101220,"Spanish Surrealist film director Luis Bunuel speaks loudly in his criticism of the upper classes in his stunning 1962 film ""The Exterminating Angel"".

A group of 20 upper crust formally attired guests are invited to attend a post opera dinner in a palatial mansion.  Prior to their arrival, the house servants with the exception of the butler, after preparing the meal, inexplicably flee the premises.

The guests, due to some unexplained force find themselves unable to leave the dining room.  The proceed to bed down for the night but come the following morning, nobody is able to leave.

Gradually the water and food run out and they are forced to attend to their bodily functions in closets.  As time and days pass, tempers flair and they shed all their pretenses and veneers and resort to acting like a pack of animals.  If not for some more level headed guests, the threat of resorting to violence among themselves is a very real possibility.

While the guests are unable to leave, outsiders are unable to enter the house.  Eventually the house is quarantined by the military.

After days of this strange incarceration the guests find themselves in the exact same positions within the room as when the force first overtook them.  They replay their actions and dialogue and if by magic the spell is broken and they can now depart.

Bunuel, always one known for his social commentary, is extremely critical of distinctions formulated by wealth in the creation of a class structure.  He portrays this group of cultured and educated people as no better than those in the lowest rungs of society when confronted with specific stimuli.",1116892800,6,1635,4.880434782608695

426092,5,6302101220,"A brilliant concept if I've ever heard one, Bunuel's finest film involves a group at a dinner party who are inexplicably unable to go home. Absolutely nothing is holding them back -- doors are unlocked, there are no barriers -- but they just can't leave the house. Kind of a precursor to Godard's 1967 masterpiece, WEEKEND, we then witness socialites and the upper-class reduced to barbaric acts of desperation. Although Bunuel claims ANGEL has no literal meaning, his contempt for the rich has never been more obvious, and he would return to similar terrain with 1972's DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, where dinner guests find themselves unable to sit down and eat. Subtle surreal touches round off this film, as random scenes repeat for absolutely no reason and sheep run about the house; not to mention the frustratingly incomprehensible yet inexplicably appropriate final scenes.",1093478400,37,886,5.159722222222222
426093,5,6302101220,"The film's central characters are overcome by their bourgeois sense of propriety and, due to pretense, are seemingly trapped in an opulent parlor room by their incapacity to overcome their own outrageous forms of hypocritical propriety. The inability to leave the dinner party first grows to absurd proportions leading to the inability of all attendees to leave at all. They are psychologically impaired and degenerate, slowly, into their basest elements until they realize, collectively, that escape is possible.
Rejecting rationalism, and accessing the unconscious desires of mankind, is at the heart of this film. The constructs of man, the masks of artifice he appropriates, are fashioned out of rationalism and serve to obfuscate reality. Man becomes pretentious, corrupt, immoral, and despondent because he has lost sense of himself. For Buuel, the bourgeoisie is ripe for attack, given that they shape and determine the values of their society. If our social leaders reject true humanity, then how can society hope to find truth? For Buuel, humanity cannot thrive under such conditions. Hell is divestiture from the self.
This film is for anyone who enjoys an intelligent and beautiful film (Cinematography by Mexican master Gabriel Figueroa). Buuel is clearly one of the greatest pillars of modern film.",1046649600,17,1311,5.4

The film is about guests arriving at a dinner party and for various reasons are unable to leave.  This simple, but interesting premise illustrates how we do not live our lives in any logical fashion and how the situations with which we are faced are what shape our world not anything as ridiculous as free will.  For anyone who can see life as it really is and not brainwashed by our societies propoganda this is the most entertaining movie ever made about human nature. This is not a movie to take a date to it is one to be savored the rest of your life as you watch an innocent situation turn into the most thought provoking film you will ever see.

For those who need them, the plot has no easy explanations and I'd even dare to say that it's open to a wide range of interpretations, but anyway, after watching the movie, some of its images will linger in your mind, as a result of the ""first class"" surreal experience the movie is, by its master himself; although I have to note, that ""The Exterminating Angel"" does not belong into the same type of Buuel's earlier completelly visually surrealistic films, like ""L'ge D'Or"" or ""Un Chien Andalou"".",1031011200,5,753,4.890625

After the dinner the guests cannot leave. There is no physical barrier at all, but they have no desire to leave the house. They can't think in their minds that they want to leave. Days pass, and the guests quarrel and fight. Some commit suicide, some hallucinate. They become uncivilized and savage-like. Some sheep enter the house and they eat them. A bear enters the house. Outside the house the Army & Police watch and cannot enter. A little boy starts to walk towards the house, and is encouraged and cheered on by the crowd. He takes a few steps, then retreats in fear.

However, in his carefully concocted screenplays, no text, no image, no character, no sequence doesn't have a meaning, not always a logical one, but at least an associative one.

Hereafter, a modest contribution to the many interpretations already published about 'The Exterminating Angel'.
We should not forget that the screenplay of this movie is based on an unfinished play by Jos Bergamin, a catholic and Marxist.

In 'Providence street' a group of upper class people (pars pro toto) gets trapped in a house after a dinner party given by the soprano Lucia after her performance as 'Lucia', the main role in the opera 'Lucia di Lammermoor' by G. Donizetti. The libretto of the opera, based on a novel by Walter Scott, contains a bad (forced) marriage, a mad scene, a ghost and a suicide, all elements used in the movie.
Before the dinner party began, all members of the underclass (the servants) had left the house for all kinds of reasons, except the majordomo ('a clown'). At night, the guests don't want to leave the house and prefer to stay inside it during the whole night. In the morning, they find out that they are trapped inside. A journey into 'the disintegration of human dignity' begins. Without their servants, the upper class members are not capable of organizing a normal way of life. Their mansion doesn't become a paradise, despite the playing of a piano piece by Pietro Domenico 'Paradisi' and despite a cabalistic ritual, amulets (chicken feet) or even a Masonic cry.
The inhabitants are confronted with other living 'symbols' inside the house: a bear (violence) and sheep (victims). The latter will be slaughtered in order to save the party members from starvation.

The spell is broken when a party member can reconstruct the past, the beginning of the ordeal. They can turn the time back and leave their prison. Their liberation is celebrated with a 'Te Deum' mass. When they come out of the church, they see another spectacle: common people are shot down by their long arm, the police. The plebs is offering itself up to the existing powers like sheep, of which a long row enters the church in a holy procession.
The opportunity of a power grab has been missed. The angel is still exterminating the underclasses.",1502582400,3,2377,4.907960199004975
