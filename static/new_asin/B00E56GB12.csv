5890961,4,B00E56GB12,"The Creeper is an ancient being.  Demonic appearance.  Origin unknown.  It's lived for thousands of years, feeding off the human race.

When people are afraid the creeper can smell them better, can tell if anyone has something he'd want to eat.  Whatever the creeper eats, becomes a part of it.  Eyes, hands, lungs, an entire head.  When wounded the Creeper can heal itself just by eating.  He's eaten so many hearts, that it's own may be unstoppable.

Most of the time the Creeper is asleep, but every twenty third spring, for 23 days the Creeper awakes.  It roams the land or flies above it on demonic wings.  Terrorizing people, finding food.

The creeper is an original monster and this is an enjoyable series.",1454716800,3,714,4.715447154471545

Second finding both movies together on blu-ray is awesome, what I liked best is that it's a two disk set, each movie is on it's own disk, I don't like those click here for one movie, click here for the other type deals.

5890986,3,B00E56GB12,"This set was not 100% what I hoped for. JC 1 has a poor transfer, looks like dvd quality, granted the lighting has been upscaled, the picture is not satisfying. JC2 is even worse, it has also an ok look, but in dark areas it has some type of static effect that I have seen on a few other blurays. This does not bother me too much but with the tech we have today and how wonderful these movies are. I can accept that both have terrible menus and basicly no special features, but they should have took more time and put in more than they gave us.
If you want to at least say or have these movies on blu ray I say go ahead and get a used copy. other than that, I am not pleased.",1420329600,3,675,3.898550724637681

5891006,4,B00E56GB12,"Nothing new here but what makes them good is the fact that they're cleverly done and the actors were chosen with care to play their parts.  The slasher/stalker/monster/mutilator is well conceived with a good back story and excellently executed (as are the prerequisite youthful bodies piling up along the roadside).  The first one has Gina Phillips and Justin Long as brother and sister who first encounter our SSMM and have to deal with the outcome.  Their banter makes what could be a tedious pedestrian exercise in horror come alive and the ""Guy"" who trips their nightmares is scary enough to make Charlie Brown stay out of the Pumpkin Patch, believe me.  Look for the late great Eileen Brennan in one of her last roles making a nifty cameo-esque appearance in the first one.

The second one ups the youthful bodies quotient by making the object of our ""Guy"" a school bus full of high school kids and stands out as a sequel by being less of a sequel and more of a stand alone. Jonathan Breck returns (I should have mentioned him for the first one because he does a 'bang up' job playing the SSMM)and wreaks more mayhem upon our hapless teens.  Ray Wise is the biggest name in it at the time (late of Reaper as the Devil) and is always good.  But the kids carry the film all the way and you'll recognize several of them as well.

I highly recommend both movies and they look and sound great in Blu-Ray.",1383523200,,1404,4.5
5891007,5,B00E56GB12,Glad i waited until the combo came out.  I was very close to ordering just the 1st movie on blu ray.  Im sorry to the people who already bought the movie before the comebo was out.  Overall the quailty was most the same as another movie converted to blu ray.  I think there was a big improvement on sound effects.  Gald its in my collection.  Rate/Respond,1383350400,,355,4.303030303030303

5891010,4,B00E56GB12,I enjoyed this movie due to its uncommon theme unlike zombies and atmospheric thrills out there. This combo is even much better and a better price. I'm glad I waited for this release.,1381795200,2,183,4.575757575757576
5891011,5,B00E56GB12,"THE CREATURE IN THESE TWO MOVIES IS TOP NOITCH. THE GUY WHO PLAYED IT SHOULD GET A AWARD. ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES AROUND. TELL YOU WHAT, I WOULD NOT WANT TO MEET IT. IN THE FIRST MOVIE THE MOVIE SCORE IS PERFECT 10. THE ACTING, LOCATIONS IS GREAT. GINA PHILIPS & JUSTIN LONG PLAYED GREAT AS BROTHER & SISTER. THE WAY THEY HANDLED THIS CREATURE IS SUPERB. I'VE SEEN  1ST ONE MANY MANY TIMES AND I STILL ENJOY THE HORROR. TO ME IF YOU WATCH THE SAME MOVIE OVER & OVER IT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE RIGHT. SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS DVD AND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY,IT'S A GREAT HORROR MOVIE. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WILL DO A THIRD ONE, I'M GOING TO HOPE THEY DO. SOME MOVIE'S SHOULD HAVE SEQUELS (3), THIS MOVIE IS ONE. SO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY NIGHT, IT'S DARK, A RAIN STOR IS COMING, MAKE POPCORN OR A PIZZA, AND ENJOY.",1380585600,,818,4.0184049079754605
5891012,5,B00E56GB12,"People stop weeping and moaning.

1.  Some have complained about the special features.  How many times do you watch special features.  Most times the special features are not in blu-ray format anyway.

2.  There are legal issues that delay or even prevent movies from being re-issued in any format.  If you look at the executive producer credits you will see that the list is significantly different.  These are the investors.  There is always negotiations return on investments and whether they have rights to any re-releases.  After all movie production is big business.

3.  Just for your info Twilight Time has been purchasing the exclusive rights to the limited distribution of many popular and rare movies on and blu-ray.  Once they are gone the price goes up by as much as 500% because they are then considered collectors items. So just be glad that this set is only $14.99.",1379376000,7,881,4.871621621621622
5891013,2,B00E56GB12,"First off, I read some reviews that said that both movies were on one disc, well this isn't true, you get two discs.

Secondly, Jeepers Creepers 2 has none of the extras ported over from it's DVD counterpart (NONE!!!).

What a flippin' rip!!!

So be warned.",1379030400,9,257,4.543478260869565

5891015,4,B00E56GB12,"Yep, they should have went combo from the start.  The stand alone BD of the original movie is now selling for practically nothing and I hadn't even opened mine yet.  It's not even worth the bother of reselling.  I guess I'll just give it to a friend and get the combo.  Along with the combo, they could have released the second movie alone for those that already had the original. I gave it 4 stars because of the movies themselves and not the way they were released.",1375920000,9,467,4.333333333333333
