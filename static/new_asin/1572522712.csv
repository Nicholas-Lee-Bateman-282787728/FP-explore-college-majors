8210488,4,1572522712,"Very interesting study of the effects of religion, especially cult-like Christianity, in a small Swedish town at the turn of the 20th century.

Has a great feel for time and place, and some very moving moments.

It almost becomes a great film, but - at least on 1st viewing - there was too much missing from understanding some of he characters' choices (perhaps because this was edited down from a mini-series), and a few too many melodramatic twists (again, with more time that might have felt less bothersome as they might have felt less on top of each other.)

Certainly a film I could imagine re-visiting, and would love to see the full, longer version.  Also, given the striking photography, a blu-ray, or at least a solid DVD transfer is absurdly over-due.",1310947200,,762,4.75
8210489,5,1572522712,"Selma Lagerlf, the first female Nobel prize winner in literature, is known in Sweden for her extraordinary storytelling gifts. Her novel Jerusalem uses as its historical background the Pietist movement of the early 19th century. This movement can be seen as the beginning of the breakdown of the state church system in Sweden, for it allowed for the possibility that the common man (not woman at this time) could be filled with divine wisdom and vision -- that this was no longer the provenance of clergymen alone. The ramifications of this movement for traditional societal order were breathtaking.

Lagerlf's novel takes this historical background and sets in its midst a responsible, strong and serious young man, Ingmar Ingmarsson, who has promised his father on his deathbed that he will grow up to be the kind of leader his village needs. The unfolding of the conflicts between religious fanaticism and common sense, of trust and betrayal, of duty and desire comprises the plot of the novel.

Bille August's film is visually stunning and moves grandly, unhurriedly, and leanly from one scene to the next. The serious viewer is unaware that the film is about 3 hours long. The plot is full of enough surprises to keep one aware, familiar enough to keep one interested, and leaves enough questions unanswered to make one think afterwards.

Other reviewers have complained that this film is too slow. Hollywood cookie-cutter films have ruined many potentially fine film palates. A fast pace and a happy ending are two of the must-haves in American mainstream cinema that, happily, many European filmmakers know enough to eschew.",1121040000,4,1631,5.0783582089552235
8210490,4,1572522712,"This movie has the aura of an Ingmar Bergman production, with a series of twists and turns in the plot - along with thought-provoking motifs reminiscent of an ancient Greek tragedy. Is there any coincidence that the  protagonist's name happens to be Ingmar Ingmarsson? It is based on a novel  by Selma Lagelof, and portrays Swedish village life around the turn of the  20th century.
Christian viewers of this movie will likely be interested  in the themes of: mainline versus apocalyptic-sectarian faith, the  destructive potential of authority and power, discerning the truth,  suffering and sacrifice, love, forgiveness, reconciliation and hope.
I  highly recommend Jerusalem because of the theological grist for the mill  that it provides. In fact, it has inspired my interest in Lagerlof's novel.",959558400,11,800,5.344
