1351243,4,B00004TJL3,"I just got this video and I must say it is quite challenging. I could feel the muscles in my legs and abs work very hard while going through the poses. Especially the chair pose. The only thing I didn't like was they do the triangle pose to one side, but not the other. I'm the type of person who needs to do the poses to both sides of the body. It really wasn't a big deal I just went ahead and did it to the other side. All in all a challenging video that will create heat and strength in your body top to bottom!",980380800,7,515,3.8679245283018866
1351244,5,B00004TJL3,"I love yoga. I think that it is by far the best exercise to increase strenght and flexibility. What I don't like is the relgion that most instructors try in inject into a session. I think that many more people would appreciate the benefits of stretching if there wasn't a lecture on philosophy included. If you're like me, you'll very much appreciate this video. It's no nonsense and let's get to work.",978048000,17,402,4.597222222222222
1351245,4,B00004TJL3,"I have seen other ""yoga"" videos and have either been so confused or i hurt myself.  This video has non annoying people in it, which is really good and they show you how to do things with a modified version.  They actually explain!  I know I couldn't believe it myself!  I would recommend this video to a begginner or an intermediate, but not to a pro, I mean if your a pro allready why are you watching these tapes?  Shouldn't you know enough allready?  Well anyways the first day I did the work out I had to take the next day off from excersise because my muscles were sore!",974073600,64,575,4.229357798165138
1351246,5,B00004TJL3,"This video is really great. They give modified versions of poses so you  can challenge yourself to varying degrees. They explain correct practice of  poses and some common pitfalls. Great video for beginners, also good for  intermediate. Definately a good workout, especially if you do the breathing  technique described in the beginning. This is much better than the  ""Rodney Yee"" tapes I've tried. My only gripe is that the music is  kind of annoying.",968803200,90,453,5.054054054054054
1351247,5,B00004TJL3,"This is a great tape. It consists of two ""power""-type yoga workouts; one 30 minutes, and another that clocks in at about 20 minutes.  Both feature poses that will challenge your strength, but in a good way. I  think anyone can do it if they really concentrate! Al is a great instructor  and he really explains the poses clearly. I'm not sure about the weight  loss, but if you want to strengthen, stretch and energize, then this is  your tape!",966384000,144,443,4.4875
1351268,5,B00004TJL3,This dvd really makes you sweat.  I am so impressed with how easyto learn but challenging this dvd is.  It doesn't matter who you are you can do yoga.  Love to switch this up with Yoga Zones Sunrise & Sunset Dvd.,1257292800,,212,4.121951219512195
1351269,1,B00004TJL3,"This moved way too fast for a beginner who knows virtually nothing about yoga. I completely disagree with another reviewer who said the instructor took time to fully explain the poses. Using the warrior pose as an example, I heard nothing about the correct positioning of the feet and would have done it wrong if it hadn't been for ALan Finger explaining the form correctly on another DVD.

Strangely, the woman who was doing the more advanced version of the exercises appeared...failing a politically correct way to say this and coming from someone who does NOT enjoy looking at supermodels in a workout, heavy-set and undefined enough to make me take notice, - an oddly unmotivating choice for a DVD supposedly focused on weight loss. Other issues  - there was a great deal of bending forward which I found completely unsuitable for a bad back.

I fast forwarded to the bonus section which, though I haven't tried yet, seemed like it should have come first.

I also have YogaZone's Beginning Yoga DVD by Alan Finger, which is vastly superior to this.",1189900800,2,1052,4.795580110497237
1351270,4,B00004TJL3,I like this video because is shows the right way to do a pose then the modified say to do a pose. It is easy and there is only 2 people to watch doing the poses and a man talking. I would reccomend this DVD to beginners.,1184630400,,220,3.702127659574468
1351271,1,B00004TJL3,"I LOVE Yoga Zone videos, and I own many. I do NOT like this video. It was one of the first that I bought 4 or 5 years ago, when I first began yoga practice. It hurt me, and I thought that I just wasn't strong enough, so I set it aside until I got stronger. Well, I got better at all of my other videos, except for this one. I truly believe that there is not enough warmup for someone whose knees are not really strong. It hurts the entire time I am doing the video, and then my knees ache for days afterward. I also do not like the repetition of a few poses over... and over... and OVER... then it ends! And there is very little emphasis on the midsection (belly!), which I think most people interested in weight loss are usually very concerned about. This workout is mostly for your trunk.

If you want a good all-over conditioning video (really challenging, but not too hard for beginners), try Yoga Zone's Flexibility and Stress Release. The meditation at the end is fantastic, too.

That said, I must clarify that I do like the 20 minute bonus session on this Weight Loss video. It is short and thorough, and not stressful to any part of my body.",1164240000,10,1150,4.2465753424657535
1351272,5,B00004TJL3,"This was my second DVD following Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning for Weightloss, which was a great place to start.  I wanted a little more and am glad I found this one.  It is challenging for a beginner but very accessible and it is really fun to see what you used to think impossible, very do-able after a couple weeks.  The chair and plank poses used to kill me but now I find I look forward to them.  Seems the thigh muscles and abs are quick to improve, which is very rewarding in itself!  I have come to really enjoy Al Bingham's very encouraging and thorough style.  I even look forward to his words near the end of the video ""you've done a great job today...really, really good...""  Completing this workout, I feel like I have indeed and like to hear someone appreciating it!

The length is just right for me, with a good warm up, nice cool down and challenging center, coming in at about 30 minutes.  There is also the bonus 20 minute session which nicely explains basic alignment and ways to challenge yourself as you grow stronger.

I've got a fairly extensive library of videos now and I still find myself reaching for this one, both to make sure I can still do it, the length is right and because I simply enjoy it!",1158105600,4,1230,4.402654867256637
1351273,5,B00004TJL3,"I had this on VHS & it quickly became my favorite Yoga Workout. So I was happy to see it on DVD. I love the people at Yoga Zone & of the male instructors I particularly like Al Bingham. Why? He is encouraging (""You CAN do Yoga! Even if you can't bend forward to touch your toes, you CAN do Yoga."") & very detailed in his instructions. Let's face it, when you're alone in your living room, there is no one there to tell you if you are doing it properly. Al shows you-through his female assistant(s) (In this case, Lisa Bennett Madken, Jean Kerner & Laura Sedome) how NOT to perform each pose & why. There are two sessions-a regular session & a Bonus session. I especially like the Bonus Session. It isn't too terribly taxing, but it is effective. Yoga, in general, stretches you in such a way that makes your blood feel energized. There are no special props, but a Yoga Mat is definitely recommended to avoid slipping. At the end, you do feel heated. Al explains the way this heat can actually help to burn calories. I believe that Yoga is a Holistic form of exercise, taking in Mind as well as Body & teaching us to be mindful of our whole self as Spiritual Beings. In this way we can lose weight & live a healthier lifestyle. I also love the Jamaican beach settings Yoga Zone uses.",1141257600,12,1282,4.301652892561983
1351274,5,B00004TJL3,"It really works you out and challanges you. You might HATE the chair pose the first few times around, but you really do gain a lot from it and eventually it becomes easier as your body adjusts. I would recomend this to someone who is slightly familiar with yoga, though a novice can adjust to it rather quickly. I don't think it is  so intimidating that it would push a person new to yoga overboard. I am impressed with the DVD and in the future I plan to purchase more of the yoga zone line.",1124409600,11,492,4.178947368421053
1351275,5,B00004TJL3,"This was one of my first yoga introductions. As a beginner , and with no excercise otherwise, I found it initially challenging but very easy to follow. Now I can manage pretty well thanx to Yoga Zone and I have the highest recommendations for this as it takes you step by step in each pose both in its modified and original forms. So this way you can see how much you have accomplished. Great background and the last meditation is very nice. Al Bingam does a great job.  Namaste",1123372800,9,478,4.370786516853933
1351276,3,B00004TJL3,"The workout is good and is a nice medium duration program, in addition to the bonus short program.  The flow is challenging enough.  The instructor gives good verbal cues, which is really important in yoga because some of the postures do not allow a good view of the TV.  I find that Al Bingham, bless his heart, is hard to listen to.  Perhaps this is a petty criticism, but he sounds like he's trying really, really hard to be sincere.  It's a bit of a turn-off.  But, bonus points for the beautiful setting.",1092268800,5,509,4.419354838709677
1351277,5,B00004TJL3,"Al Bingham has a unique teaching style. He focuses on achieving and maintaining the correct position for each posture. This particular Weight Loss Yoga practice session relies on time-tested principles to achieve weight loss results.

By removing all the restlessness you experience from daily stress, you can then start to address unconscious eating habits. Suddenly, you are making better choices and wandering in the natural foods isle of your grocery store. Since starting Yoga, I've rarely found myself at a fast-food establishment and when I do happen to be there with my husband, I'm making better choices. For example - salads or low carb options.

So, Yoga works. This I've proven to myself. It strengthens you from the inside out and also helps you focus on your health instead of just ""exercising."" Yoga actually makes you a more well-rounded person, except you can see it toning your muscles and making your face look more relaxed. In fact, if you skip your Yoga, you start to crave the peaceful serenity of your daily ""moment with yourself.""

Al Bingham's voice is so pleasant and his instruction style is positive and nurturing. I love how he takes a hands-on approach and really guides you through each exercise. You can be assured you are doing it correctly because he explains each position in depth.

This is one of the most accessible yoga workouts out there. The exercises range from beginner to intermediate with some interesting variations for the chair pose which made the pose less exhausting, and much more creative. You will recognize positions like Warrior 1 and plank pose. There are yoga-style pushups and the entire exercise routine is pleasantly paced. The Sun Salutations are healing and teach you to breathe.

Al Bingham's calming voice makes this a favorite for late night relaxing. The beach scenes take you out of your home environment and give you a mini vacation.

~The Rebecca Review

P.S. Also look for Yoga Zone Flexibility and Stress Release",1089763200,15,1983,5.009118541033435
1351288,5,B00004TJL3,"I've done this tape several times and really like it a lot!

 The particular things I like about this practice are:

1. Al Bingham is an excellent easy to follow instructor.

2. Modifications are shown by one instructor and the full poses by the other.

3. Much of it is based on the Sun Salutations, but it is broken down incrementally so that your body has a chance to adapt to each posture.

4. I found that it generated a good amount of heat and sweat.

5. It's only about 30 minutes which makes it very doable in terms of fitting into a schedule, plus you can push pretty hard without it becoming impossibly long so you don't have to worry about becoming overly fatigued.

6. It's challenging physically but all the poses can be done by most people in reasonably good health (no crazy poses that you need to be Gumby in order to perform).

7. The Yoga Zone programs in general have a very nice feel to them, a nice presentation in terms of the scenery and the instructors are not intimidating.

8. The pacing is flowing but not rushed.

 Just a suggestion for those doing this regarding the chair poses. If you find them really tough (and they certainly can be), just start straight legged, the as you slowly sweep your arms overhead (or in front of you) gently lower down to the first ""edge"" of tension and breathe there. Don't push yourself EVER to the point of pain, just  mild discomfort. You can also practice them dynamically, start higher up (straighter legs) and on each inhale raise up a little to release the stress and on each exhale just gently go a little bit lower than before. This makes the pose much safer and builds heat.

 Anyway, I like this video, the bonus video is also an effective practice and only about 20 ,minutes so it's a nice practice to either alternate with for variety or to use on days when time is short.

 Namaste",1086220800,17,1855,4.424778761061947
1351289,5,B00004TJL3,"This video is great for anyone looking to get into Yoga.  Instructor Al does a great job of taking you through the whole work out pose by pose, with clear instruction.  You are left with no doubt that you are doing it right.
 As well you will also acheive visible results from the video, and you will be able to feel the affects of the video the next morning.
Though with any work out video it may take two to three times before you really get the hang of it.
This video really gave me the Yoga bug, and helped me to develop a real appreaciation for Yoga and it's benefits.",1068163200,6,573,4.1441441441441444
1351290,2,B00004TJL3,"I love the Yoga Zone series in general, but this particular one completely stresses me out!  The instructor is horrible.  He overtalks, is way too hyper, and talks more about what NOT to do rather than the correct poses.",1054425600,4,220,4.615384615384615
1351291,5,B00004TJL3,"This is a great tape for building heat and sweat. The increased number of awkward chair postures and repetition of Warrior 1, if used to your maximum ability, really get you sweating. So, play around with it and make these as hard as you can without hurting yourself of course.
Any conditioned level of person, from total beginner to really advanced, can get a good workout from the first section. If you are not a beginner, you ""should"" know that modifications to make asanas HARDER (not just easier, with blocks etc.) are there to do. For example, go deeper into a pose, get your thigh at 90 degrees to floor in Warrior 1,2 and lunge poses. Also, take awkward chair as far down as you can go and tuck the tailbone while reaching up as high as you can, putting palms firmly together. Modifications such as these make any Yoga workout tougher if you want it to be. I highly recommend the Yoga Zone book for beginners; it covers more material than all the videos put together.
For those who did not notice: the bonus workout may LOOK like the first one, but the postures are very different because you are striving to maintain a completely extended spine throughout. For example: the forward bends don't have you hinging at the hips like is usually done; in this workout you tuck the tail and round into the forward bend. Again, focus is on the SPINE throughout, with directions to put most effort into spinal extension rather than the usual parts you're strengthening or stretching. My back feels great after the bonus workout. I hope this review is helpful.",1032912000,26,1558,4.628158844765343
1351292,4,B00004TJL3,"Being new to yoga, I started with a friend by going to classes. However, classes never seemed to be at a convenient time, and I could see cost escalting easily, so I looked to video. I have been using the Yoga for Weightloss video, along with a few others from Yoga Zone and find them to be valuable for the true beginning yoga student. In addition to moving you through a series of poses, instructor Al Bingham and company provide alternative poses and guide you by identifying where your hips, back, neck, etc. should be placed for each position to keep you from harming yourself and providing a better workout. This is great for anyone who has not been particularly physically active, or has past injuries in the joint or back areas. Al Bingham's lighter personality and motivational-like speaking is a nice change from the heavy-weighted philospohical instructor types, although I can see how he might not appeal to everyone.
However, if you are an ""advanced"" beginner or intermediate student, you will probably find that this video is too easy for you. I quickly outgrew this video (within 2 months of using this and other Yoga Zone beginner level videos at 4 days a week), but the basics it provided me in checking for correct form in my poses allowed me to feel more comfortable in videos that do not provide such info, like the ""Beginner"" video set of Rodney Yee.
Despite quickly outgrowing this beginner series, it was well worth the money that it saved in classes, provides the basics for correct form and provides me a lighter workout for days that I just don't feel up to speed.",1028851200,14,1590,4.682142857142857
1351293,2,B00004TJL3,"Instructor's voice is not peacecful, and he cannot pronounce the word which I probably cannot spell but have heard many times: ""Namaste."" Poor cinema and sound.  Camera angles are not very professional and do not vary much. Check out Rodney Yee's videos and compare.  They are much more engaging.  I have watched this twice and have no interest in doing it.  Time goes slowly.  It is very regimented and no fun. After the first session, there is a meditation. The script is good, but who gestures during a meditation?  Far to American for this confirmed Anglo!  There is a bonus session at the end that gives very good detailed info on proper positioning, but you are asleep or angry by the time you get there.",1022889600,4,710,4.632
1351294,5,B00004TJL3,"I first saw the name of this tape on a recommended video list at DietSmart.com.  Our climate currently limits one's ability to hike or bike outside; with a small child to consider as well, a tape seemed like a good option.  I checked the reviews in this section and saw a bimodal distribution -- lots of 4's and 5's, and a small cluster of 1's.  Since I've done some yoga and danced for many years, I tried it out.  I honestly think the people who are saying it's too hard on the back are not listening to what the instructor is saying (I thought this meant he would keep you in the Camel position for 15 minutes!): he focuses a lot on breathing, lengthening and correct positioning, and his demonstrators give a modified version where one is possible.  If you're new to yoga or to an exercise program, it might be wise to start with the conditioning section that comes at the end; otherwise, I think this is a great workout that tones mind and attitude as well as body.  I've often blown off the meditative posture at the end of a yoga workout, but this video shows you how to use it in combination with affirmations to feel more positive about yourself whether you're losing weight or not.

1351295,4,B00004TJL3,"this is some where in between a regular beginning/intermediate yoga session and a power yoga workout.  it's a relatively short (30 minute) session that is usually good for working up a little sweat.  it has the activity level of power yoga but with the less challenging poses more commonly associated with the beginning/intermediate level.  also, it doesn't have very many stretching poses so don't look to this tape as something to really enhance your flexibility all that much.

1351297,5,B00004TJL3,"This 30 minute (not including the 20 minute bonus section which is nearly idential to the first session) video is fabulous.  The instructor has two assistants, one who demonstrates the modifed poses, the other who performs the poses in a way that only an experienced yogan can.  The ""class"" begins with the instructor teaching several poses individually.  When doing the video the first few times, I found this extremely helpful.  However, after having taken this ""class"" many, many times, I STILL appreciate the first fews minutes where each pose is practiced individually because it helps to stretch me out and focus on the intricacies of the movements that i'm about to perform.
MOVEMENT is what is key about this video; for, after learning the basic psoes, the instructor does a fabulous job of beautifully combining those poses into a series of movement.  There's not too much resting after the first few minutes, but who needs it?  The video is short and it feels wonderful to flow into strengthing positions.  Alhough the class feels more like dancing, it's INTENSE dancing.  If you are not dripping with sweat after 15 minutes, you're doing something wrong.",980467200,29,1165,5.0
