8764084,5,B01GWC8M4A,"PASOLINI's ""SALO"" is far more intense than this rather excellent 'retelling' of 'Faust' / 'Orpheus'  ... in modern-day terms.  This movie is far superior to the Hollywood 'Saw' / 'Hostel' and 'whatever fare', since there's a great story-line plus a nasty little twist - not the ending itself, but the definition of 'brotherly love'.
Our misguided 'Orpheus' - desperate for finances to support his family - accepts an 'unusual' offer to make an 'Art' Film ...... its' improvised via the hidden director, orchestrated by his sinister 'storm-troopers' in black and watched - from a slight distance' - by another sinister entity .....
It IS brilliantly edited, with 'bordering on explicit' sexual moments ... but most of us have seen probably worse?  There's a stench of 'truth' to this scenario ~ the deliberate and sensuous decline of Modern Day Morality.
HIGH RECOMMENDED for the 'non-squeamish' - it certainly ain't Mary Poppins.
QUITE, quite impossible to envision an American or English version ~ casting would be impossible - imagine Tom Cruise or better even Bradley Cooper / Ryan Reynolds or Ryan Gosling  as the lead [who resembles Polanski in the original].
It borders  strongly on Paul Verhoven, David Lynch, Cronenberg and Friedkin territory ...... maybe even Ken Russell [with Olivier Messiaen blaring in the background] ..... naturally in 3-D IMAX!

and 'yes' Pasoline is applauding with von Trier!",1537315200,,1409,5.212389380530974
