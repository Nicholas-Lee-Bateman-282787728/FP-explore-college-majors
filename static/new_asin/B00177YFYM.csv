3168499,4,B00177YFYM,"To the above reviewer, yes the film may not be great, and you may not think it was funny or whatever, but your comparing it to a movie that has nothing in common with this film. Dan In Real Life???? Are you serious? Martin Lawrence along with several other African American comedians have always made films like this, they have nothing to do with Romance, and warm family comedy. They are suppose to relate to a certain audience and that is it. If you expect too much from an actor, or a trailer....... You will be dissapointed every time. I agree Martin has lost his edge a bit, but he has been doing it for a long time now, and I believe he will be just fine in years to come. If you are a Martin fan, buy the movie, if not do not buy it, it is not going to appeal to you.",1208736000,10,774,4.032467532467533
3168500,5,B00177YFYM,"To say awesome would be understating how great a comedy this is. It was so good my wife and I wanted to see it again the same day. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This movie should be included in everybody's movie collection, It's that good.",1207958400,7,247,4.061224489795919
3168501,4,B00177YFYM,"RJ Stevens (Martin Lawrence) is the host of an irreverent and raunchy talk show in the sun-soaked state of California, and is engaged to ""Survivor"" contestant Bianca Kittles (Joy Bryant). One day, he recieves a phone call from his old parents (Margaret Avery, James Earl Jones), who ask him to come over for their 50th wedding anniversary. With them and his son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) goading him to go, he takes his clan to the Deep South, where old wounds are open, and a crush from the past (Nicole Ari Parker) returns to make RJ question if his glamorous life defines who he is.

I think ""Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins"" can be compared to Amanda Bynes films: they're really good, but they'll probably appeal to certain audiences and turn off the rest. It's also Martin Lawrence still looking for that ""Get Out of Jail"" card to apologize for the recent crap he shoved in our faces since the disastrous ""Big Momma's House 2"". And Malcolm D. Lee, brother of Spike Lee and the birth parent of the blaxploitation spoof/homage ""Undercover Brother"", is behind the lens. For me, I find the film to be immensely entertaining in a year that began with a couple of crappy films (J-horror films) and underwhelmingly overlooked gems (the new Rambo). And I can always live with that.

The film has been compared to the works of Tyler Perry, someone who makes the most headache-inducing films that African-Americans don't deserve, but see anyway. Here, Lee is looking to really go for broke with an impressive ensemble of comedians including Mike Epps (underwhelmingly underrated), Cedric the Entertainer (coming off the worst film of last year, ""Code Name: The Cleaner""), and Mo'Nique (I won't go any further), while bringing in already successful actors like Michael Clarke Duncan (further sharpening his comedy skills post-""Talledega Nights"" - who could forget the outtakes!), Margaret Avery (another student of the Ruby Dee school for lovable grandmothers) and James Earl Jones (always a pleasant appearance) to round out the cast.

With that list, how does the film fare? Oh, it's a funny one. While not a gut-buster (some scenes - including a race between RJ and Clyde - seem to drag on), there are a slew of funny scenes. Lee still hones his satirical vision from ""UB"", and sends up the talk circuit with a no-good cheater (newcomer - I think - Affion Crockett). When he moves on to the meat and bones of the film - the family reunion/anniversary - the film becomes a mixture of Adam Sandler-type schenanigans and urban sitcom wisecracks. That's not to say it's unfunny. You can thank scene stealers like Mo'Nique and Mike Epps for that job (ugh, the bathroom scene is priceless).

It all boils down to Lawrence, however. Still looking to get critics back on his graces after being dissed during the ""Black Knight""-""BMH2"" era, the comic actor decides to tone it down and play a humbled loser. That allows him to achieve good chemistry between all his co-stars, including a welcome appearance from Nicole Ari Parker, someone who hasn't been seen since the Anthony Anderson disaster, ""King's Ransom"" (three years were worth it, I might add).

The only problem with the film is its need to grow a heart while being a jovial walk in the park. It's no surprise, since Lee tried his hand at a coming-of-age film (""Roll Bounce""), but someone should've gave him a copy of ""Old School"", which maintained its funny bone the whole way through. It sort of causes ""Welcome Home"" to trip a bit, but doesn't derail the film completely. Compared to the recent crop of cruddy urban films released before, this brings back a bit of scrappy charm and respect that black or white audiences can enjoy.",1202428800,9,3676,4.828571428571428

3168616,4,B00177YFYM,I never write reviews especially for movies but when one like this gets so slammed in outside circles it makes me mad.  This is one of the few movies I can watch again and again and still laugh.  The same goes for a few Tyler Perry movies.  They both have their very corny clishe moments but the real sense of family and values done with the great humor that these movies are done with more than compensate for the hangups.  Most people that can totally relate to these movies have family members right out the movies or maybe their spouse does either way its nice to laugh at someone else's drams for a couple of hours.  Plus you cannot beat the outtakes at the end of this movie or When Madea Goes to Jail  which makes buying each one well worth it.,1408752000,2,751,4.253521126760563

It's especially funny on days when life is challenging and I need a really good laugh; this movie is loaded with funny scenes.  Most of us have wacky dysfunctional families and Roscoe's family is no different.  Most of us want to tell our relative, don't marry that girl/guy, most of us have someone that got away, most of us have a sister/brother who talks too much, most of us have a father/mother who compares us to someone else, most of us have a relative who always wants something; that's Roscoe's family, and in a lot of ways, ours too.  That's why it's so funny!",1406332800,,721,4.390977443609023

3168654,5,B00177YFYM,"Well I love comedy, especially those that ring some truth in them. This is basically a story of Roscoe (Martin Lawrence) who has a hit TV talk show (like Jerry Springer) and he is dating a pretty, but uppity women that just won a season of survivor! How classic, the movie plays several very funny jokes of the survivor show that is worth the price alone. ( Note, I think all reality TV is horrible and should be made fun of so there you go). Well Roscoe hasn't been home in a while (down south) and its time for the family reunion! So he packs up his survivor girl and his son and heads down south from LA. HIs family consists of Cedric the Entertainer (funny), the popular stand up comedian Mike Epps (who is dating a white girl), and the late, great Michael Clarke Duncan, who is his brother and the sheriff. Also to shake things way up is Mo'nique who visits the local jail on conjugal visits and the jokes that this inspires are priceless.  Watch it!

3168658,5,B00177YFYM,"I enjoyed this show so much that I watched it about 6 times.  I disagree with the reviewer who said it would appeal to only a certain portion of the population. This is a movie for all people and all families.  The jokes and humor are hilarious.  The acting is great. The message, however, that I came away with is that family are the most important people in our lives.  There is no offense so big that a good family can not forgive.  It appealed to me despite the fact that I am not Black, White, or Asian.  I am a latin  male who has been around for a long -long time. If this movie had been made to appeal to a certain people then Spike Lee would have failed.  This movie is great for everyone.

Mo'nique and Mike Epps stole the show.  Cedric the Entertainer brought his A game once again.  I was glad to see Martin Lawrence doing this type of comedy again, since I never did like the Big Momma series of films.

 Margaret Avery, MIchael Clarke Duncan and James Earl Jones rounded out a near perfect cast.  The only weak link was Joy Bryant.  Her delivery was unconvincing, uninspired, just plain flat.

3168718,2,B00177YFYM,"Several years removed from his coming-of-age misfire Roll Bounce, lensman Malcolm D. Lee gathered an intimidating cast of African American actors and headed to the South for some home-cooked comedy in Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. But there was a problem--a few, actually. Not only is Roscoe Jenkins a mostly-stale clunk of leftover slapstick (not what I'd like to open the fridge to in the morning), it's an awkward assemblage of misused stars that feels uninviting rather than warm, which is what a movie about family in the South should be.

Dr. RJ Stevens (Martin Lawrence) is a successful, familiar face in Hollywood. He has his own talk show (which, from what is shown, looks more like the Jerry Springer kind of ""talk"" show), a smart, kind, athletic son, an L.A. mansion, and a fiance (Joy Bryant) who redefines the term diva--she's a prissy, bossy, Survivor-champ vegan with an annoying physical regimen, an annoying Pomeranian pooch, and an annoying voice (as one character pinpointed it, she's ""the black Paris Hilton""). But when his parents call to invite him to their weekend-long 50th anniversary celebration, all that he has amassed is left behind for the quiet Southern town he grew up in and has since grown out of.

As if the movie's beginning wasn't formulaic enough for a Lawrence comedy (or any comedy for that matter), once Roscoe ""RJ"" Steven Jenkins, Jr. reaches the slack destination that he, his son, his fiance, her ""lab rat,"" and her 57 bags of luggage set out for, Lee constructs this so-called ""comedy"" by seemingly duplicating a thousand other, not-worth-duplicating comedies' blueprints--an uncomfortable reunion followed by cheers and celebration, then the arrival of a rival (Roscoe's cousin Clyde, played by Cedric the Entertainer) and an old flame (Nicole Ari Parker, who represents the ""better"" girl for Roscoe), then chaotic mishap (basically, Roscoe messes everything up because he's ""adapted"" to his red carpet lifestyle, rendering him incapable of acting by the traditional Southern norms that he spent his 20 years living by).

Of course, someplace mashed in the middle, Roscoe confronts his disapproving father (the terrific James Earl Jones, who's neglected any quality screen time for squishy Martin Lawrence faces and farting-while-doing-yoga scenes), realizes that family comes before fame, makes amends with everyone he'd ticked off, and swaps his inconsiderate, arrogant wife-to-be for the kind, less-threatening girlfriend he wished he had all along. And don't get your panties all in a bunch for bequeathing upon you that top-secret, G-14 classified information--you'd find out for yourself by watching the opening 20 minutes anyway--but rather consider it a favor. Now you can watch something else without worrying that the your hungry curiosity to know how Roscoe Jenkins ends (don't lie, everyone knows you were curious) will eat you if not fed. Ease your mind and pick a movie you might take pleasure in watching.

Truth be told, there are a handful of chuckle moments in this systematic genre flick, all of which come from the supporting cast (Michael Clarke Duncan, Mo'Nique, and especially Mike Epps are very funny in their roles), but the droughts between them are long and tedious and not worth the whole of the film. However, if for some inexplicable reason you have seen and found amusement in Malcolm Lee's newest failure, the DVD release will be no disappointment to you, for it offers a smorgasbord of in-depth and not-so-in-depth supplementary material, including Joe's ""We're Going Home"" music video, an extended opening scene, deleted scenes, outtakes, a short on-the-set piece, cast and crew interviews, and an extensive feature commentary option with the director.

3168722,5,B00177YFYM,"Talk-show sensation RJ Stevens left behind his modest Southern upbringing and family name to transform into a self-help guru dispensing his ""Team of Me"" philosophy to millions of adoring fans. With a reality-TV-star fiancee and money to burn, there's no piece of the Hollywood dream RJ hasn't achieved. After his parents request that he come home for their 50th wedding anniversary, the TV host packs up his 10-year-old son and diva bride-to-be and heads back to Georgia. It's a chance to prove to his family that he's no longer the awkward kid they relentlessly picked on. At least, that's the plan. But when his crazy, lovable family calls him on his big-city attitude and challenges him at every turn, RJ is forced to take a hard look at the man he's become.

3168743,2,B00177YFYM,"The misbegotten comedy ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" features Martin Lawrence as a ""Trash-TV"" talk show host who, against his better judgment, attends a family get-together commemorating the 50th wedding anniversary of his parents (played by James Earl Jones and Margeret Avery, who are both way too classy for this enterprise).  Roscoe's return leads to a seemingly endless series of conflicts and petty competitions between the citified prodigal son and his country bumpkin relatives still living back home.

The performances are fun and lively - particularly by Mo`Nique, who steals the show as Roscoe's loudmouth, up-in-everybody`s-grill sister - but the threadbare script, filled as it is with predictable slapstick and cloying sentimentality, rarely makes us laugh.  The movie probably would have been better had it dispensed with the family reunion concept altogether and, instead, focused on satirizing Jenkins' day job.  As it is, there`s really nothing in Roscoe`s attitude and demeanor to suggest that he has anything in common with the Jerry Springers of the world.  And without that angle to distinguish the movie from every other run-of-the-mill family comedy of recent vintage, any possible interest the film might have generated dies aborning.

3168750,4,B00177YFYM,"I like watching movies where the family is a central character.  Reminds me of Big Fat Greek Wedding.  There's something fun about how a family shapes the central character and how that central character tries to find his or her own identity.

An excellent cast of smart actors make for a very funny film, but also a heart warming film.  And each character is distinct.  Well-played by the actors.  Sometimes you get family movies where two or three characters are the same, but what makes this move stand out is each character had its own personality and shaped the film.  Each character had fairly equal screen time yet still maintained the story-line.  That's pretty good writing.

I definitely have to give two thumbs up to Mo'nique because she played her character to the T.  I wasn't sure if she was really acting or adlibbing, but it was entirely believable.

Definitely worth a watch and very entertaining.",1233964800,,914,4.794871794871795
3168751,4,B00177YFYM,"I must say that Martin Lawrence has grown into a respectable comedian. I have always been a Martin fan since before his television show. I was always disappointed at some of the past roles he chose that made light of being ignorant, silly or just downright offensive to blacks. Lately as Martin's grown older he's taking more fulfilling, family comedies that not only have a plot but  a lot of fun and a lot of heart.

Saying that, I found Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins a straight delight. The film was a beautiful comedy that anyone can appreciate. My complaint was that there were a few dead spots and the storyline wasn't original. Martin's films all seem to follow the same line, he's with one woman but realizes he's never gotten over the woman from his past. Yet, the laughs and characters of this movie ultimately saved what what could have been a very cliche'd, boring and predictable plot.

As I'm writing this review I haven't even finished the movie but I've seen enough of it to appreciate and recommend to anyone who loves a good, down home, Southern comedy.

Kudos to Martin Lawrence for growing up into a fine and respectable comedian! I wouldn't mind a sequel!

I found this film amusing. I particularly liked Mo'Nique as his sister, and the scenes of his relatives on his television show in the credits. There were some cliche elements I could've done without such as the country mouse cliche (Roscoe became a big star, becomes egotistical materialistic etc.) Also the glories of finding true love with your high school sweetheart. *Yawns*  These tropes are done to death in films.

There is a little grossness, mostly in the forms of fake and kind of silly  dog fornication. (Between his girlfriend's pomeranian and a golden retriever), and suggestive themes. Not for small kids, but teens have probably seen worse.",1220745600,3,900,4.894736842105263

3402998,4,B00177YFYM,"RJ Stevens (Martin Lawrence) is the host of an irreverent and raunchy talk show in the sun-soaked state of California, and is engaged to ""Survivor"" contestant Bianca Kittles (Joy Bryant). One day, he recieves a phone call from his old parents (Margaret Avery, James Earl Jones), who ask him to come over for their 50th wedding anniversary. With them and his son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) goading him to go, he takes his clan to the Deep South, where old wounds are open, and a crush from the past (Nicole Ari Parker) returns to make RJ question if his glamorous life defines who he is.

I think ""Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins"" can be compared to Amanda Bynes films: they're really good, but they'll probably appeal to certain audiences and turn off the rest. It's also Martin Lawrence still looking for that ""Get Out of Jail"" card to apologize for the recent crap he shoved in our faces since the disastrous ""Big Momma's House 2"". And Malcolm D. Lee, brother of Spike Lee and the birth parent of the blaxploitation spoof/homage ""Undercover Brother"", is behind the lens. For me, I find the film to be immensely entertaining in a year that began with a couple of crappy films (J-horror films) and underwhelmingly overlooked gems (the new Rambo). And I can always live with that.

The film has been compared to the works of Tyler Perry, someone who makes the most headache-inducing films that African-Americans don't deserve, but see anyway. Here, Lee is looking to really go for broke with an impressive ensemble of comedians including Mike Epps (underwhelmingly underrated), Cedric the Entertainer (coming off the worst film of last year, ""Code Name: The Cleaner""), and Mo'Nique (I won't go any further), while bringing in already successful actors like Michael Clarke Duncan (further sharpening his comedy skills post-""Talledega Nights"" - who could forget the outtakes!), Margaret Avery (another student of the Ruby Dee school for lovable grandmothers) and James Earl Jones (always a pleasant appearance) to round out the cast.

With that list, how does the film fare? Oh, it's a funny one. While not a gut-buster (some scenes - including a race between RJ and Clyde - seem to drag on), there are a slew of funny scenes. Lee still hones his satirical vision from ""UB"", and sends up the talk circuit with a no-good cheater (newcomer - I think - Affion Crockett). When he moves on to the meat and bones of the film - the family reunion/anniversary - the film becomes a mixture of Adam Sandler-type schenanigans and urban sitcom wisecracks. That's not to say it's unfunny. You can thank scene stealers like Mo'Nique and Mike Epps for that job (ugh, the bathroom scene is priceless).

It all boils down to Lawrence, however. Still looking to get critics back on his graces after being dissed during the ""Black Knight""-""BMH2"" era, the comic actor decides to tone it down and play a humbled loser. That allows him to achieve good chemistry between all his co-stars, including a welcome appearance from Nicole Ari Parker, someone who hasn't been seen since the Anthony Anderson disaster, ""King's Ransom"" (three years were worth it, I might add).

The only problem with the film is its need to grow a heart while being a jovial walk in the park. It's no surprise, since Lee tried his hand at a coming-of-age film (""Roll Bounce""), but someone should've gave him a copy of ""Old School"", which maintained its funny bone the whole way through. It sort of causes ""Welcome Home"" to trip a bit, but doesn't derail the film completely. Compared to the recent crop of cruddy urban films released before, this brings back a bit of scrappy charm and respect that black or white audiences can enjoy.",1202428800,9,3676,4.828571428571428

This movie is loaded with laughs,as Martin Lawrence goes home for a family reunion to see his relatives & he brings his fiancee along with his son. He soon realizes that family is more important than fame,also he is reunited with his old flame girlfriend. There is nothing but pure comedy here along with some underlying family issues. The film is a perfect feel good comedy for anyone to enjoy,it may be slightly inappropriate for young children(depending on level of maturity) because of decent amounts of sexual inuendo. All in all it is a great family friendly comedy i guarantee you will enjoy if you are looking for laughs.",1449878400,,801,5.122137404580153

The premise is a simple one that's been done before,  local guy makes good in the big city, and returns home for the family reunion to help celebrate his parents golden anniversary. The difference being the Martin Lawrence touch of ad lib humor is what makes this movie  a stand out... in fact, you can expect to see equally funny contributions from Cedric the Entertainer, and a particularly hilarious shower scene between Mike Epps, and MoNique.",1411862400,,480,4.9875

3403113,4,B00177YFYM,I never write reviews especially for movies but when one like this gets so slammed in outside circles it makes me mad.  This is one of the few movies I can watch again and again and still laugh.  The same goes for a few Tyler Perry movies.  They both have their very corny clishe moments but the real sense of family and values done with the great humor that these movies are done with more than compensate for the hangups.  Most people that can totally relate to these movies have family members right out the movies or maybe their spouse does either way its nice to laugh at someone else's drams for a couple of hours.  Plus you cannot beat the outtakes at the end of this movie or When Madea Goes to Jail  which makes buying each one well worth it.,1408752000,2,751,4.253521126760563

It's especially funny on days when life is challenging and I need a really good laugh; this movie is loaded with funny scenes.  Most of us have wacky dysfunctional families and Roscoe's family is no different.  Most of us want to tell our relative, don't marry that girl/guy, most of us have someone that got away, most of us have a sister/brother who talks too much, most of us have a father/mother who compares us to someone else, most of us have a relative who always wants something; that's Roscoe's family, and in a lot of ways, ours too.

3403151,5,B00177YFYM,"Well I love comedy, especially those that ring some truth in them. This is basically a story of Roscoe (Martin Lawrence) who has a hit TV talk show (like Jerry Springer) and he is dating a pretty, but uppity women that just won a season of survivor! How classic, the movie plays several very funny jokes of the survivor show that is worth the price alone. ( Note, I think all reality TV is horrible and should be made fun of so there you go). Well Roscoe hasn't been home in a while (down south) and its time for the family reunion! So he packs up his survivor girl and his son and heads down south from LA. HIs family consists of Cedric the Entertainer (funny), the popular stand up comedian Mike Epps (who is dating a white girl), and the late, great Michael Clarke Duncan, who is his brother and the sheriff. Also to shake things way up is Mo'nique who visits the local jail on conjugal visits and the jokes that this inspires are priceless.  Watch it! If you like comedy of color that is true to life.",1378512000,,1005,4.2894736842105265

3403155,5,B00177YFYM,"I enjoyed this show so much that I watched it about 6 times.  I disagree with the reviewer who said it would appeal to only a certain portion of the population. This is a movie for all people and all families.  The jokes and humor are hilarious.  The acting is great. The message, however, that I came away with is that family are the most important people in our lives.  There is no offense so big that a good family can not forgive.  It appealed to me despite the fact that I am not Black, White, or Asian.  I am a latin  male who has been around for a long -long time. If this movie had been made to appeal to a certain people then Spike Lee would have failed.  This movie is great for everyone.

3403215,2,B00177YFYM,"Several years removed from his coming-of-age misfire Roll Bounce, lensman Malcolm D. Lee gathered an intimidating cast of African American actors and headed to the South for some home-cooked comedy in Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. But there was a problem--a few, actually. Not only is Roscoe Jenkins a mostly-stale clunk of leftover slapstick (not what I'd like to open the fridge to in the morning), it's an awkward assemblage of misused stars that feels uninviting rather than warm, which is what a movie about family in the South should be.

Dr. RJ Stevens (Martin Lawrence) is a successful, familiar face in Hollywood. He has his own talk show (which, from what is shown, looks more like the Jerry Springer kind of ""talk"" show), a smart, kind, athletic son, an L.A. mansion, and a fiance (Joy Bryant) who redefines the term diva--she's a prissy, bossy, Survivor-champ vegan with an annoying physical regimen, an annoying Pomeranian pooch, and an annoying voice (as one character pinpointed it, she's ""the black Paris Hilton""). But when his parents call to invite him to their weekend-long 50th anniversary celebration, all that he has amassed is left behind for the quiet Southern town he grew up in and has since grown out of.

As if the movie's beginning wasn't formulaic enough for a Lawrence comedy (or any comedy for that matter), once Roscoe ""RJ"" Steven Jenkins, Jr. reaches the slack destination that he, his son, his fiance, her ""lab rat,"" and her 57 bags of luggage set out for, Lee constructs this so-called ""comedy"" by seemingly duplicating a thousand other, not-worth-duplicating comedies' blueprints--an uncomfortable reunion followed by cheers and celebration, then the arrival of a rival (Roscoe's cousin Clyde, played by Cedric the Entertainer) and an old flame (Nicole Ari Parker, who represents the ""better"" girl for Roscoe), then chaotic mishap (basically, Roscoe messes everything up because he's ""adapted"" to his red carpet lifestyle, rendering him incapable of acting by the traditional Southern norms that he spent his 20 years living by).

Of course, someplace mashed in the middle, Roscoe confronts his disapproving father (the terrific James Earl Jones, who's neglected any quality screen time for squishy Martin Lawrence faces and farting-while-doing-yoga scenes), realizes that family comes before fame, makes amends with everyone he'd ticked off, and swaps his inconsiderate, arrogant wife-to-be for the kind, less-threatening girlfriend he wished he had all along. And don't get your panties all in a bunch for bequeathing upon you that top-secret, G-14 classified information--you'd find out for yourself by watching the opening 20 minutes anyway--but rather consider it a favor. Now you can watch something else without worrying that the your hungry curiosity to know how Roscoe Jenkins ends (don't lie, everyone knows you were curious) will eat you if not fed. Ease your mind and pick a movie you might take pleasure in watching.

Truth be told, there are a handful of chuckle moments in this systematic genre flick, all of which come from the supporting cast (Michael Clarke Duncan, Mo'Nique, and especially Mike Epps are very funny in their roles), but the droughts between them are long and tedious and not worth the whole of the film. However, if for some inexplicable reason you have seen and found amusement in Malcolm Lee's newest failure, the DVD release will be no disappointment to you, for it offers a smorgasbord of in-depth and not-so-in-depth supplementary material, including Joe's ""We're Going Home"" music video, an extended opening scene, deleted scenes, outtakes, a short on-the-set piece, cast and crew interviews, and an extensive feature commentary option with the director.

With a reality-TV-star fiancee and money to burn, there's no piece of the Hollywood dream RJ hasn't achieved. After his parents request that he come home for their 50th wedding anniversary, the TV host packs up his 10-year-old son and diva bride-to-be and heads back to Georgia. It's a chance to prove to his family that he's no longer the awkward kid they relentlessly picked on. At least, that's the plan. But when his crazy, lovable family calls him on his big-city attitude and challenges him at every turn, RJ is forced to take a hard look at the man he's become. He may be a superstar in L.A., but he's just one of the guys in Dry Springs. I like Martin Lawrence movies. This movies is very funny and entertaining.

3403240,2,B00177YFYM,"The misbegotten comedy ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" features Martin Lawrence as a ""Trash-TV"" talk show host who, against his better judgment, attends a family get-together commemorating the 50th wedding anniversary of his parents (played by James Earl Jones and Margeret Avery, who are both way too classy for this enterprise).  Roscoe's return leads to a seemingly endless series of conflicts and petty competitions between the citified prodigal son and his country bumpkin relatives still living back home.

The performances are fun and lively - particularly by Mo`Nique, who steals the show as Roscoe's loudmouth, up-in-everybody`s-grill sister - but the threadbare script, filled as it is with predictable slapstick and cloying sentimentality, rarely makes us laugh.  The movie probably would have been better had it dispensed with the family reunion concept altogether and, instead, focused on satirizing Jenkins' day job.  As it is, there`s really nothing in Roscoe`s attitude and demeanor to suggest that he has anything in common with the Jerry Springers of the world.  And without that angle to distinguish the movie from every other run-of-the-mill family comedy of recent vintage, any possible interest the film might have generated dies aborning.

3403247,4,B00177YFYM,"I like watching movies where the family is a central character.  Reminds me of Big Fat Greek Wedding.  There's something fun about how a family shapes the central character and how that central character tries to find his or her own identity.

An excellent cast of smart actors make for a very funny film, but also a heart warming film.  And each character is distinct.  Well-played by the actors.  Sometimes you get family movies where two or three characters are the same, but what makes this move stand out is each character had its own personality and shaped the film.  Each character had fairly equal screen time yet still maintained the story-line.  That's pretty good writing.

I definitely have to give two thumbs up to Mo'nique because she played her character to the T.  I wasn't sure if she was really acting or adlibbing, but it was entirely believable.

3403248,4,B00177YFYM,"I must say that Martin Lawrence has grown into a respectable comedian. I have always been a Martin fan since before his television show. I was always disappointed at some of the past roles he chose that made light of being ignorant, silly or just downright offensive to blacks. Lately as Martin's grown older he's taking more fulfilling, family comedies that not only have a plot but  a lot of fun and a lot of heart.

Saying that, I found Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins a straight delight. The film was a beautiful comedy that anyone can appreciate. My complaint was that there were a few dead spots and the storyline wasn't original. Martin's films all seem to follow the same line, he's with one woman but realizes he's never gotten over the woman from his past. Yet, the laughs and characters of this movie ultimately saved what what could have been a very cliche'd, boring and predictable plot.

As I'm writing this review I haven't even finished the movie but I've seen enough of it to appreciate and recommend to anyone who loves a good, down home, Southern comedy.

Kudos to Martin Lawrence for growing up into a fine and respectable comedian! I wouldn't mind a sequel!

3403254,5,B00177YFYM,"This is a movie I truly enjoyed being that I love Martin and Mo'Nique. And I was glad to see B-Lanca, LOL, get what she had coming in the end.

If you have yet to see this movie, be sure to check it out. You will laugh your behind off!

3403257,5,B00177YFYM,"A real funny movie about all the unique persons who make up a family the things that drive them apart and what brings them together. Under the surface of what seems to be a strong bond lurks constant competition, resentment and pets that should seek therapy. Martin Lawrence,Mike Epps, Mo'Nique, Michael Clarke Duncan, Cedric the Entertainer together in the same movie give nothing but laughter after laughter.",1216598400,,410,5.134328358208955

If you want to purchase this movie, wait until the price goes down, which I'm sure it will or borrow it from the library, because it sure isn't worth what I paid.",1216080000,,337,3.869565217391304

3403263,1,B00177YFYM,". . . not even a chuckle.  If you think farting during yoga is funny, this movie is for you.  If you think having a big dog jump on someone is funny, this movie is for you.  If you laugh your head off because the airline loses Martin's luggage and he's forced to wear silly clothes, this movie is for you.  For everybody who has already graduated from the third grade, look elsewhere.",1214092800,5,384,4.219178082191781
3403264,4,B00177YFYM,"I love pretty much anything that Mo'nique is in and anything Martin is in.  To see them here together was a real treat.  This movie is fun and enjoyable and sure it's corny and silly in some parts, but you can't take it too seriously.  The cast is great (Nicole Ari Parker, James Earl Jones, Cedric the Entertainer, Joy Bryant etc) and the story fun.
Roscoe has moved across the country to get away from his family and is a talk show host out in LA.  He goes back home to visit when it's his parents' 50th anniversary.  It's there that we see exactly how zany his family really are and why he left in the first place.  It's hilarious and yet we do also see him accept his family as they are too.
It's not Oscar material for sure, but it's a great movie for light entertainment with a terrific cast that will surely make you laugh.  It's enjoyable and I really liked this one.",1212969600,12,875,4.234939759036145
