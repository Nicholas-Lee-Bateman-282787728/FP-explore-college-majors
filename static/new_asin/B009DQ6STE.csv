5320780,5,B009DQ6STE,"In this uplifting and spiritual journey the audience is dropped right into the otherworldly, deep south culture of Angola Prison, otherwise known as the Louisiana State Penitentiary, and are introduced to it's humble, yet dangerous, inhabitants. At the same time they are introduced to the unbelievably talented and kindhearted Canadian blues singer Rita Chiarelli, who happens to be visiting Angola in an attempt to work with the prisoners on creating a musical act. The film avoids revealing the crimes committed by these prisoners, who are serving life sentences in a maximum security prison, so that the audience doesn't form a predetermined view of them. This allows the viewers to sympathize, favor, and even relate to the prisoners as the film advances and the story plays out. We quickly learn that many of the men have changed and become much more spiritual, and even religious due to their time serving. The message of the film greatly reflects this by noting the angst-ridden history of the blues genre as a whole and relating this to the dark pasts of the inmates; and then showing how this same music is what gives the inmates an outlet to express themselves in a deeply spiritual and healthy way. Overall, it's a great documentary that thoroughly explores a highly overlooked subject and shows that even in the darkest people in the darkest situations music can uplift one's spirit.",1358985600,,1396,5.021551724137931
5320781,5,B009DQ6STE,Music from the Big House is heartfelt and amazing. I was truly surprised by the quality of the music coming from inside the prison - they're really great! It was really interesting to hear their stories and their music. You could really feel the angst and sorrow from the prisoners. I will definitely watch this again!,1358899200,,318,4.696428571428571
5320782,4,B009DQ6STE,"Music From the Big House was an incredibly touching film that shows us an aspect of the prison system that is usually overlooked, the talent of the individuals within the prison. All of the individual inmates who get interviewed in the film are very musically gifted. Showing us several different bands that formed within the prison, the final concert that Rita Chiarelli put on with them has varied musical types: Country, Blues, Jazz, and Gospel. Rita acts as a guiding force or narrator as we follow her specific journey into Angola prison. Her unique viewpoint on the prisoners' situation makes any viewer question what is really going on inside these prisons. She makes a great point in saying that ""we"" on the outside feel like we are unaffected by what goes on inside the prisons, but the pain of those individuals trickles down through their families and friends. But Rita also is sure to keep in mind that there are victims out there who are suffering the loss that these men now hold the guilt for. She feels a strange moral quandary when working with group, for she begins to love them, they are good people. From the viewers perspective we pick up on this as well. With many interview bits jumping in-between the musical numbers, we get to know each character, each person relatively well. The film does a good job of putting us into the shoes an perspective of the Angola prisoners and how they deal with ""the knowledge that they are going to die in there."" For many men, coming to prison was actually a saving grace that allowed them to leave their foolish youth behind and accept a more compassionate and loving lifestyle through the church.  Overall the film leaves you off feeling like, wow, these are changed people, good people, talented and inspirational individuals living within Angola prison, but then the carpet is pulled out from under you as their violent and malicious crimes are revealed to you. Music From The Big House makes you question whether or not you can forgive people for such horrific crimes, whether people can actually change or not.",1358899200,2,2074,4.777158774373259
5320783,5,B009DQ6STE,"Music from the Big House is an amazing film.  It has fantastic music, good storytelling, and interesting characters.  This is not a film that beats you over the head with a message - it just tells a really good story.  I was so impressed at the balanced approach that lets the audience explore the role of music from both sides of the bars.  The music itself can be raw or energetic or soulful, but it always carries the story forward.  It is music that plays with your mood because of its sheer power.  Plus, watch the film with friends and you are guaranteed very interesting discussions!",1358899200,,590,4.518867924528302
5320784,5,B009DQ6STE,"Music From the Big House is truly an amazing film.  It examines forgiveness, hope, and redemption as it exists in the darkest places.  The movie doesn't make a judgement on the prisoners - by their own accounts they are guilty of their crimes - or the justice system that has put them behind bars for life.  Rather, it explores how they deal with their sentences and their struggle to find a sense of value and peace within their circumstance.  The music in the film is phenomenal.  You hear the raw joy and release of music in these songs - a temporary release from the bleak reality of these men's lives and their guilt.",1358899200,,622,4.469026548672566
8540409,1,B009DQ6STE,"A real abomination. The concept is terrific: capture on film the convicts (some of them lifers; most of them black) of a Southern prison as they transcend their circumstance through the power of song. Unfortunately what we're served here is a patronizing exploitation of those prisoner by by an obnoxious Canadian who bills herself as ""Canada's Goddess of the Blues."" Yeah, right. So much for the black guys who have something to sing about. This is HER movie about HER songs and HER sympathies for the poor fellas doing time who have been conned (sorry) into trying to make her look and sound good. They don't. So much potential sabotaged by the ego trip of someone who, frankly, should go back to the beer bar circuit where she belongs.",1456358400,,738,4.728682170542636

8540412,5,B009DQ6STE,"This inspiring documentary really tells a story worth hearing. With the combination of beautiful cinematography, amazing people, and truly great music to top it off, this movie has a lot of heart and soul.",1369180800,,205,5.0588235294117645
8540413,5,B009DQ6STE,"Great story, captivating, really makes you think.  Would have liked more character development and music, but, overall, this is a great film.",1368748800,,141,5.409090909090909
8540414,4,B009DQ6STE,"Really enjoyed this one. Without giving too much away, the film welcomes you in with interesting characters and their musical talents before turning to confront the sobering reality of our prison system. Both aspects prove highly intriguing.",1366329600,,241,5.54054054054054
8540415,4,B009DQ6STE,"I love polished, acoustic blues. This is not a story/concert like that. Some of the men are good and talented and some are...less. But these are men living how they can, using blues/gospel/r&r, to get through each day. It is a very powerful and moving view into the lives of men who made horrible choices and now pay the tragic consequences. Musically it is good, but primitive. The people are compelling. Forces you to realize that those who commit our worse crimes are still people, fathers,brothers, husbands,friends.",1364601600,,520,4.988505747126437
8540416,5,B009DQ6STE,"Oh what a wonderful surprise.  Most times, a prison movie is filled with whining prisoners who only want screen time to cry about man's inhumanity to them.  This movie is about a bunch of musicians who just happen to be doing time in Angola.  I loved the rapport between Rita and the men.  I was dancing and caring and decided before I was even done watching that I wanted my own copy of the movie and the CD. Hope you don't miss your copy!!",1362960000,,441,4.214285714285714
8540417,5,B009DQ6STE,"I knew what Music From the Big House was going to be about, in a very general sense, and being a blues fan I was looking forward to it.  Id never heard of Rita Chiarelli but I became a fan very quickly; her passion for the blues and her own craft is genuine and contagious.  As you learn the history of Angola Prison and the individual stories of the inmates you kind of lapse into feeling sorry for these men.  The whole time I was trying to remind myself that these inmates were serving life terms for a reason, and without being told what crime they had each committed almost made it worse as I imagined every heinous crime in the book. But as the movie went on, I became so engaged with these mens stories that the fact that they were imprisoned almost fell to the wayside.  They were funny and gentle and seemed like normal people and the dynamic there between the people I was witnessing and the fact that they were convicted felons created a very real tension that kept me invested in the story.  For any fan of the blues, watching the inmates perform with Chiarelli was incredibly raw and emotionally visceral.  When these guys are belting out lyrics about death and loneliness and redemption, specifically on the Chiarelli-penned Lay My Bones To Rest, you believe every word they sing.  It feels real, feels so absolutely honest and heartfelt that you cant help but be enraptured by their performances and feel like a part of the experience.  They croon like the condemned men they are, the shadows of their sentences hanging over their heads like vulture. That kind of emotion cant be faked, cant be bought, but can only come from experience.  Theyre doomed and they know it, and that raw, emotional, cathartic release is refreshing in a world of bubble-gum pop stars and flavor-of-the-month radio hits.  It offers a constant gut check on the nature of forgiveness and who should be forgiven, and theres no way to leave the movie without conflicting emotions.  These men have nowhere to go but up, and witnessing these seemingly changed men, men who seem absolutely peaceful and at peace with themselves, bear their souls and stories is beautifully haunting.",1362009600,,2168,4.678947368421053
8540418,4,B009DQ6STE,"Music from the Big House is a captivating and inspiring film. One woman takes a step inside one of America's bloodiest prisons to give the cellmates a chance to connect with music. It follows the journey of prisoner's past, and how even though they will be in prison for life, the ability to sing and play guitar helps them find the joy in life. Rita Chiarelli is the sign of hope and forgiveness. Her voice and heart reach out to the men who were never given a second chance. The movie shows what can be done with the power of music. The interviews and journey through the prison is very moving. All you need are the vocals of Chiarelli, and the prisoners to hook you for another viewing.",1359331200,,689,4.390625
