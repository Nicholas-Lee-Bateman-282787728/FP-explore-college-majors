My chipping has been so good that my friends call me ""Bobby Eldridge"".
I have several of his DVD,s but this one(short game) is the best.",1355356800,,290,4.087719298245614
8156867,5,B000KHN5WS,"This dvd introduced me to a different way of thinking about the short game than I had been working with. Not revolutionary , but different for me. The information is well presented and the production values are strong. I am now looking at other dvd by this company. Bobby Eldrig is the key. He is a good presenter of the information.",1318377600,,333,4.475409836065574
