3537697,5,B001DSNFQ4,"Cartoon Network's new series Chowder is the best cartoon since SpongeBob SquarePants (which is funny because this show is from one of SpongeBob's creators). This DVD will turn out to be a great one!

From sources, the DVD is suposed to contain ten episodes from the series (whether that means 2 shorts = 1 episode or 1 sort is considered as one episode is unknown). Along with Total Drama Island, Chowder is one of the better cartoons out there (another good animated show is Skunk Fu!).

Chowder is full of zany and entertaining characters. Mung Daal, Chowder's teacher in the art of food; Truffles, Mung's fairy wife; Ms. Endive, Mung's arch nemesis; Shnitzel, Mung's rock monster assistent; Panini, Chowder's girlfriend (even though he doesn't see it that way!); and many many more funny characters.

My edvice, buy the DVD of Chowder Vol. One. It's worth the money and it is a great show. Buy and enjoy this series. Trust me, you'll have a good time.",1223683200,5,954,4.7696969696969695

3537733,1,B001DSNFQ4,This is a great show. However this dvd is a repeat of mostly vol. 1 and vol. 2. Just another way to get ripped off.

I remember seeing the show when it was fresh on tv. What a hoot!! the whole family loved it!!!
It's too bad cartoon network canceled it, a show like this was taken down prematurely..because it was unique and stood out on its own, different & non conforming un-political correctness... and just healthy comedy for all ages.",1392854400,,428,4.916666666666667
3537737,2,B001DSNFQ4,"I really enjoyed this show and was disappointed when it was discontinued. I saw that there were 2 volumes of Chowder, and bought the first assuming it would have at least the first season. Instead it has 5 episodes from the first season, not even the first five in a row, just five randomly selected. What a rip-off, but I guess that's what I get for not reading the description and reviews better. Just another example of marketing greed, I guess. I will be reselling this and waiting for the complete seasons/series to be released. In my opinion, this type of release is one reason piracy is so prevalent. I always try to buy disks of the shows I like, but if they're not available, or ridiculously overpriced, it's tempting to look online for somewhere to download from.",1388534400,2,773,4.608695652173913

We really like Adventure Time and Regular Show but sometimes it can be a little much for younger kids. Chowder was the perfect in-between show for the out of Nick Jr. but not into tween shows category that my kids fall into.

The animation feels like an acid trip with its bright colors and geometric shapes, the humor is just amazing, and the voices are just spot on! I have been watching this show since it premiered in 2007, and have been in love with it since. A good amount of viewers can relate to all the characters, because they go through what we go through in life. Teens and adults will enjoy this show just as much if not more than the kids will. I certainly hope Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network will put out more DVDs of this show! It's hilarious!

It seems to me to be more readable and less obscure than Faulkner, as good as Steinbeck at his best, and in the accurate details, like John McPhee. It is illuminated by moments of poetic description. I wished for more.",1324339200,,271,4.333333333333333
3537749,1,B001DSNFQ4,"I have seen a few episodes of this cartoon, but that isn't enough to say how bad it is. If I can find one show that doesn't make any sense, ""Chowder"" definitely fits that bill. If you want to know what I'm talking about, here are some possible reasons:

1. The animation. It's GHASTLY. One minute, it's a colorful animated background and the next thing you know, it's live action that is beyond ugly. ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" has better animation than this.

2. The characters. Extremely annoying and unlikeable. First off, there's Mung Daal, (or however you spell his last name). He is an imbecilic, try-hard idiot with hardly any consistency whatsoever. He is also a coward. Believe me, I've seen an episode where he turns into a lily-livered baby when the gang is hunting for monster peaches. Not to mention he does a poor job of teaching Chowder how to cook.

Truffles: How about this character, right here? I absolutely HATE her. She is the abomination of cartoon characters. Another thing is, she's cruel to Mung Daal, she argues with him, she ignores him and I just don't get why she wanted to marry him in the first place.

Schnitzel: Here is an example of a bad sidekick that you don't see often in TV shows these days. The writers could have given him some speaking lines like the rest of the characters, but NO. All he ever says is, ""Radda."" That repeated line gets pretty irritating, if you think about it.

And finally, the worst of them all, Chowder. Good grief, I simply cannot stand him. He is completely too hyper and really needs to get a grip. He's also overly sensitive and downright dumber than a pile of rocks. In some episodes, he doesn't know when to shut up. For instance, in the first episode, I think, he continuously screams out, ""BURPLE NURPLES!"" and whines ""please"" to Mung Daal for about ten minutes. That's when I was thinking, ""Oh, for crying out loud, WILL YOU BE QUIET?!!!!""

If you've read the reasons in this review, I hope that you have your answer. This ""show"" is horrible. Cartoon Network is going into the gutter with this one.",1273104000,6,2067,4.603260869565218
3537750,5,B001DSNFQ4,"This is one of the funniest cartoons on television.  Comparatively, no other show really stands up to it (except maybe The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack).  This isn't necessarily my favorite collection of episodes, but I highly recommend it to just about anyone nonetheless.",1265587200,,280,5.488372093023256
3537751,1,B001DSNFQ4,"I love Chowder. but this is too little content for the price.
This DVD does not contain half of Season 1. It contains one fourth of Season 1. There were 20 episodes containing 38 cartoons (Two were double length). This DVD contains 10 of the 38 cartoons as five episodes. The description above says 10 episodes when it is actually ten cartoons. The widescreen picture is beautiful, and the cartoons are grouped into two cartoon episodes (just like on TV) so that you get to see all of the clever and funny openings and closing credits. The menus are well done, and include a ""Play All"" option. But this is gonna cost over $[...]bucks for the first season IF they all come out on DVD!?!",1247184000,31,685,4.488

3537753,5,B001DSNFQ4,"I stumbled upon this cartoon because I was in the same room as my sister when she was watching it. At first glance, I thought it was like any other poorly thought out cartoon, but I got hooked on the story and continued to watch.

Chowder is definately one of the most creative cartoons I've ever watched. The creators are truly talented. The stories are actually original!! The anamation styles used vary in an interesting blend. The fantasy element of the show is catchy; there's so many crazy people and foods that exist in their world. The humor is everything you could want from a cartoon, its sophisticated and childish at the same time.

I appreciate some of the vulgar cartoons out there, don't get me wrong. But Chowder is like a breath of fresh air. It's clean, wholesome comedy that parents could watch with their kids, and actually enjoy watching it. My sister and I are both in our twenties and we both love the show. At the same time there are so many things about Chowder that would captivate kids; its very imaginative.

I haven't met anyone who's watched this show and not liked it, so to anyone considering buying this DVD, I fully recommend it. It is well worth the $10.",1237420800,2,1189,4.546728971962617

Not to mention that the show itself is hilarious and fresh. I already have both seasons downloaded through Zune, but buying the DVD's was a no brainer as soon as I heard about the widescreen format.
It seems trivial but the full widescreen picture, which the show is originally made for, makes quite a difference even from the intro and you get to see all the beautiful lighting on the inner sides of the oven that you couldn't see before. Also, the picture quality itself is improved drastically over digital downloads, no more digital artifacts blurring up the screen during Chowders many random food transitions or fast sequences. The dvd looks amazing and crisp even on my 1080p TV being played off an xbox360. My only gripe is that you only get a few episodes per DVD, and the next installment isn't even due for another few months yet cruddy shows like Bakkugan are already on their 3rd dvd.

3537760,5,B001DSNFQ4,"For a long while I've avoided Cartoon Network except for the occasional Adult Swim (and I do mean occasional). I know they were still making shows with cult following like ""Fosters"" even though I was never a big fan of it.

However I've been hearing positive reviews about their show ""Chowder"" so I decided to check it out. Wow, glad I did.

So, it's basically about a little kid who apprentices for a catering company. Chowder is, as one character described, a scatterbrain. He constantly spouts random statements regardless of whether it makes sense or not and has extremely short attention span, which makes his job difficult.

I've long been a fan of bizarre cartooning (one of my favorite comic strips, ""Arnold"" by Kevin McCormick, is even more random and bizarre) and Chowder is no exception. Hopefully it'll continue to air for a while.",1227052800,,843,4.840277777777778

Segments included on this DVD:
- The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin / Chowder's Girlfriend
- Grubble Gum / The Cinnamini Monster
- Certifrycation Class / The Sing Beans
- Majhongg Night / Stinky Love
- The Thrice Cream Man / The Flibber-Flabber Diet",1226448000,20,424,4.578947368421052
3537763,4,B001DSNFQ4,"Here's the recipe:

First, you take some fresh Cartoon Network talent ripe for the picking.  Second, you take that talent and put together a brand-new hit series where the synopsis is, say, a young and always hungry boy struggling to become a great chef.  Next, you take that synopsis and create some original, yet funny-looking characters and the amazing new world for them to live in.  Then, you prepare some stories for each of the show's episodes like, for example, how to cook a pot of singing beans, or how one little piece of gum can cause a lot of trouble, or how to get rid of an annoyingly clingy girlfriend.  Finally, you add a secret ingredient that tends to tear down the fourth wall.  Serve immediately, and enjoy !

And that is what ""Chowder"" basically is: a little guy with a HUGE appetite.  Under the guidance of his respected mentor and master chef Mung Daal, along with his wife Truffles and his assistant Shnitzel, it's never a dull moment in Marzipan City, even if that girl Panini would only leave poor Chowder alone.  The DVD has 10 of your fave episodes in a rare widescreen format.  And as a bonus, they've peppered in the original storyboard for the classic episode ""Chowder's Girlfriend"".

So when you have a craving for ""Chowder"", you know where to look: Cartoon Network.  And look out for new episodes of ""Chowder"" on special Thursday nights called ""Har Har Tharsdays"".",1226275200,3,1398,4.684426229508197
3537764,4,B001DSNFQ4,"first off, let me state that i have no kids and only watch cartoons as an adult because, well, because i like 'em!

that said, 'Chowder'  has been a breath of fresh air in the super-choppy, herky-jerky world of tv series that, lately, seem like nothing more than a reason to sell ever crummier toys to an unsuspecting public.

the premise: a young cat is an apprentice chef, in a very trippy world that's very unlike our own. everything is alive and conscious, vegetables go happily and smilingly into the oven (where they baste themselves until cooked), the sun and moon are marionettes that go to bed at the end of their work shifts, the world is flat and rests on the shoulders of a cookie-loving giant, recipes have an ""eat me/drink me""-like effect on the world around them, and so on.

the design and atmosphere of this show are unique: it feels more 1970s than anything since the heyday of Sid & Marty Krofft ('H.R. Puf'N'Stuf,' 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters,' etc etc).  come to think of it, it feels more authentically 1970s than most of the 1970s did themselves!  visually, the show is rich and textured, with some surprising depth and consistency to the artwork.  the writing, too, is well above average - not quite 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' good, but close: clever, quick and witty, it's all things that most contemporary cartoons aren't.

i can see where some parents might have issues with the level of bathroom humor in the show (in one episode, chowder can't use the bathroom because other people are in the room, and nearly explodes from the back pressure); them, i would advise to lighten up.  it's innocent and sweet fun.  my friends' kids, my girlfriend's kids, they all love the show.  personally, i'd rather see them watching this than at least 2/3 of the real kid-oriented dreck on the tube these days.

4 stars instead of 5, because the same creative team is - i believe - behind another cartoon network show 'the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack,' that really does deserve the top rating.  that, and the extremely heavy rotation 'Chowder' received when it went into reruns has shown me that it doesn't hold up 100% after near infinite viewings.",1225756800,,2168,4.718832891246684

8294710,5,B001DSNFQ4,"This used to be one of my favorite shows on Cartoon Network. It's a bit strange, but it fits with the quirky characters and colorful setting of the cartoon. So many quotes from this show are perfect to this day, and I was extremely saddened when they pulled the show off Cartoon Network. This is probably my second favorite only behind Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends.",1495497600,2,372,4.651515151515151
