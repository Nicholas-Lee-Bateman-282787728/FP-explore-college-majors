8568588,4,B00BHLTJ2Q,"Very interesting. Films excellent, and covers the entire war day by day. But, the commontater is monotone and  mispronounces names and words. For the money, this was a great deal.",1466467200,,179,4.966666666666667
8568589,5,B00BHLTJ2Q,"Great with ONE exception- sound was TOO loud on a 2 minute track near end of vol. 2 I believe, otherwise Well Done!",1439424000,,115,4.043478260869565
8568590,4,B00BHLTJ2Q,It was a gift.  My friend liked it.,1412467200,,35,3.375
8568591,5,B00BHLTJ2Q,"I am just a student at UNF, but I think is one of the best and most complete series about World War II",1388188800,,102,3.4782608695652173
8568592,2,B00BHLTJ2Q,I guess I should have known what I was getting with this.  It really is a diary type production with sing-song narration.  It will put you to sleep.,1387324800,3,148,4.25
8568593,5,B00BHLTJ2Q,"I've only watched the first 6 months, but like what I've seen so far.  The narration is kind of lame, and the same clips are used on multiple dates, but overall very satisfied.  The chronological approach is great for tying the war and all of its fronts together.  Other documentaries in my collection didn't even touch on Russia's war with Finland, but the Russia-Finland skirmish receives a good percentage of the attention in the first six months of WWII Diaries.  Will definitely buy Volume II whenever it becomes available.",1373241600,2,528,4.898876404494382
