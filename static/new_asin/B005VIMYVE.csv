This film is a remarkable accomplishment, capturing the life and message of Rev. Aloysius Ellacuria, CMF, a well known Basque missionary who is inspired by the founder of the Claretian Missionaries, St. Anthony Mary Claret&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Autobiography-of-St-Anthony-Mary-Claret/dp/0895552841/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Autobiography of St. Anthony Mary Claret</a>.",1388620800,4,547,7.5625
8487498,5,B005VIMYVE,"I'm sure that many of us would not have heard of Father Aloysius Ellacuria. With that in mind I was very interested in getting to know about him and what I have discovered is that unbeknowest to us, we had a very holy priest, a spiritual giant in our midst, and not many had known it.
This 70 minute documentary explores the life of this remarkable priest from his impoverished beginings in the Basque region of Spain to his holy death in the United States. It is subdivided into various chapters:
1) The early years.
2) The Guilds
3) Fatima
4) Alamos, Sonora, Mexico
5) Spirituality and Personality
6) The Miraculous
7) Eternal reward.

This documentary consists of interviews with Father's close associates and people who knew him as a spiritual father and guide. From time to time you can hear his voice giving a discourse on spirituality, which was probably recorded in the 70's.
What is truly astounding is that like the Cure of Ars, Father Ellacuria had the gift of reading souls and performing miracles by the power of God. This is a story of a saintly priest, a holy man who lived for Christ, with Christ and in Christ.

I would like to pay particular attention to Father's Purity of Intention: An examination of Conscience, which is in this documentary. Of which to give you a foretaste, I will state a couple:

1)Do I follow my own tastes, wishes, inclinations, curiosities or feelings instead of the known will of God?
2)Do I permit myself to be downcast when I seem to be making no progress in spite of all my efforts?

This is only 2 out of 10 considerations. For the rest, get the DVD. It is worth it.
This DVD has no special features and no chapter selections.",1320883200,15,1675,4.5364238410596025
