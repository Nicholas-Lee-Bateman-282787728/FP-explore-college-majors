7956694,5,B00005Y6ZI,Absolutely outstanding!  Ahead of its time.  Relax and enjoy a great story.,1522886400,,75,5.166666666666667
7956695,5,B00005Y6ZI,"This movie did resemble the original ""Treasure Island"" save for the dubbing of language. I saw this a long time ago. One Christmas when I was a kid, I got something called a View Master with the ""Treasure Island"" picture reels. No one under fifty will probaby know what a View Master is. That was my first introduction to Jim Hawkins, the Captain & the bird. Classic, but there has to b a better version of this memorable classic.",1506124800,,430,4.455696202531645
7956696,4,B00005Y6ZI,Good movie based on the book. Originally in Russian but so well dubbed you hardly notice.,1504051200,,89,4.625
7956697,5,B00005Y6ZI,Old Soviet version in English. One of my absolute favorites as it closely follows the book I read as a child in the 70s.,1499472000,,120,4.041666666666667
7956698,3,B00005Y6ZI,"This is the russion version of the classic story, and one can tell. Things aren't quite as high budget but overall, it is pretty good. The main thing that I didn't like was that many of the transitions in the story were rather abrupt. Now the story isn't too complex, but it still takes away from the movie.",1050624000,5,307,4.310344827586207
7956699,4,B00005Y6ZI,"I saw this film 30 years ago, and after reading review of of the man ,who got it insted of Disney version, I decided to see this film one more time. My opinion- If you order cheesburger and insted they send you bottle of vodka, it doesn't make vodka bad, inspite of your disappointment. I found this film better then british version(with Orson Wells as John Silver), it is more accurate to the book, and it is is very important to the ""Tresure Island"" buffs. And Boris Andreev as Silver much more believebel then Orson Wells (I didn't see Disney version of the book) It is a pretty seemly film. I didn't see the DVD But I know  that RUSSICO company made perfect copys.",1023580800,7,668,4.387096774193548
7956700,5,B00005Y6ZI,This is a great movie dubbed in at least 10 languages (that I know of). Another person rated it as 1 only because it was not the version he was expecting and apparently didn't watch it at all. Saying that this is a bad movie would be equal to saying that all black and white movies are bad.

7956701,1,B00005Y6ZI,"I thought I was ordering the Disney classic as this was the only movie that appeared for ""Treasure Island.""  I am not sure what this Russian rip off is exactly but from the few minutes I watched, I felt like the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 were there with me laughing at what a horrible movie this is.  I am in the progress of trying to return it because it is so bad.  Where be my Disney Classic--lordy lordy this thing ain't right!",1019692800,6,444,4.261904761904762
