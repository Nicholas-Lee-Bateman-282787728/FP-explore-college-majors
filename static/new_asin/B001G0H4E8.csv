But years of  syndicated re-runs (including a brief stint on on the infamous UPN network) has helped the series gain some of the respect it deserves. (It even occasionally appears on some Independent stations to this day). Although produced on a tight budget and rushed into production, ""The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" is made worthwhile by it's light humor, which is often so ""corny"" that it's very funny. The animation style, while panned at the time, holds up well and is refreshing in these days of ""computer generated"" animation.

This DVD may seem a little unnecessary with two larger ""volume sets"" on sale, it still has it's merits. For those who like the series, but want to ""try before buying"", this DVD is an economical choice.

The four episodes are entertaining, and the series is most certainly recommend to fans of early 1990's animation, syndicated animation, ""strip programming"" (a term for shows that air five times a week during their original run), the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" video game series, as well as those who just plain like the 1990's. Being a fan of all the above, this has become one of my favourites, and I look forward to buying the ""larger volume sets"" at a later date.",1234310400,4,1338,4.859649122807017

8303305,4,B001G0H4E8,"Got this for $1 and it was a good buy.  The ""Adventures"" series is often maligned by fans simply for its comedic nature, loose continuity, or squash-and-stretch style of animation, but most people forget it was also the first animation to place Tails in his iconic sidekick role.  The five episodes collected here are not the only times in the series that the fox got major plot parts, or even got the spotlight shined on him, but they are some of the best.  Of particular note is ""Tails's New Home"" which is one of, if not the very, first depictions of how Sonic and Tails met.  A very good buy if you are hungry for Tails-centric adventures.",1353456000,,643,4.47008547008547
8303306,5,B001G0H4E8,This is the FIRST CARTOON related to the sonic that came out it was on air when family matters was still being show.

8303307,2,B001G0H4E8,"I couldn't sit through this movie with my kids.  They thought it was okay, but prefer Sonic X. These are grainy and poorly written.  I can usually sit through about anything, but I only lasted 10 minutes on this one.  I would recommend the Sonic X movies as they are better quality, more exciting and overall easier to watch.",1282694400,,325,4.47457627118644
