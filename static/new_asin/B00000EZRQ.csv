1199839,4,B00000EZRQ,"Christian Clemenson (who played Socrates on The Adventures of Briscoe County Jr) did an excellent job as the priest.  He didn't have many lines, but the expressions on his face are hilarious. I like the whole idea of the  movie.  Anyone who enjoys American history will enjoy this spoof on the  Lewis and Clark expedition.  Also, the scenery is beautiful.  Some parts  border on the ridiculous, nevertheless this is a very funny show.",948931200,,434,4.863013698630137
1199840,5,B00000EZRQ,"I just loved this movie. It is too bad that this was one of Farley's last movies though. I enjoyed the scene after Farley's told them about the sadistic animals of the wild. Then one of the crewmen spotted an animal on  the bank and they all went crazy and started shooting at it with their guns  and a boat cannon. Farley told them it was only a squirrel then one of the  crewman yelled, ""He's got something in his hands!"" And they all  went crazy again shooting at it. I would recommend this movie to anyone and  especially those Chris Farley fans.",943747200,,550,4.300970873786408
1199841,5,B00000EZRQ,"This movie is very important to many viewers because this was Farley's last. That is one reason I loved it. I also love Matthew Perry, star of the hit show friends. Perry and Farley are a good duo mostly because they are  so different but equally as funny. I heard on the Rosie O'donell show that  while shooting this movie as a joke Farley would strip on the set right  before they filmed a scene. Then Farley would come onto the set and say his  lines like nothing was wrong. Matthew commented on this joke as sick but  damn funny! Chris will be missed.

This movie consists of many comic scenes and slapstick sketches. The main theme is held together by Lisa, who plays the counter part of Sacagawea. She would not look bad on the golden dollar either.",1503446400,,488,4.821428571428571

1199950,5,B00000EZRQ,This movie is a must have. It's hilarious. I don't want to give too much away but the basic plot is Chris Farley's and Mathew Perry 's character rallies up a group together to beat Louis and Clark from making it across America first.

1200056,5,B00000EZRQ,"Eighteen years on, I still revisit this film one or more times a year. Unlike more grounded ""everyman"" comedies that put otherwise relatable characters into wacky situations (Tommy Boy, Ghostbusters), this film is chock full of fundamentally unlikable oddball characters, none of whom is playing with a full deck, bumbling from one surreal vignette to another. Pretty much from the jump this film crosses the line between ""zany"" and flat-out bizarre and never looks back. And it's all gold. So many wonderful, ridiculous scenes and running gags. So many perfectly cast journeyman comedic actors, each fully committing to his character's unique strain of insanity. And the dynamics and interactions among them are simply priceless.  Very much in the vein of a Happy Gilmore or Dodgeball-type screwball comedy, only even more unhinged. Just get it, it's $5 new for crying out loud.",1460678400,,879,5.23404255319149

When Farley would go into a repetition routine, the editors started editing out more and more of the repetition (watch the eagle egg scene) and take all of the air out of the joke.

They were in stitches, but I had to fight very hard not to be a grump and prick the balloon of their amusement. To my mind, humor is best when it enables us to laugh at ourselves and become mature as we learn to do so. Bad or puerile humor springs from and encourages the immature tendency to laugh at others and in doing so to feel superior and ""with it"". This film is full of bad humor. The amusement of my dear grandsons was understandable, but it embarrassed me to find their natural puerility encouraged. It is a gloomy thought that their silliness, forgivable at eleven or twelve, would, given no better entertainment than this, grown into the offensive and snorting animal-house silliness that disfigures much older folk in college frat houses and beyond. The film industry that produced Charlie Chaplin and Art Carney and Mel Brooks should be ashamed to sink to this level.",1403740800,,967,4.627906976744186

Expecting to just veg out and enjoy the next 1.5 hours of your life? Yep

We see Farley as he is as an actor and as well as I feel he was as a regular person. Plenty of iditotic headbusters, drunken ballbusters and drug induced headbanging to count this title as nearly co-directed by Farley himself (maybe it really was?).

My kids were finally old enough to watch it, and we were looking for something funny to watch together, so I decided to give it a try. It's just not good.

1200387,3,B00000EZRQ,"""Almost Heroes"" is the last of the comedy films starring Chris Farley who passed away in 1997 from drug overdose just shy of the movie's 1998 release (production had been postponed on several occasions due to Farley attending drug rehabilitation).  Prior to ""Almost Heroes,"" Farley headlined roles in ""Tommy Boy,"" ""Black Sheep,"" ""Beverly Hills Ninja,"" and ""Dirty Work,"" the last of which was also released after his death.  Directed by Christopher Guest, ""Almost Heroes"" stars Matthew Perry as Leslie Edwards, Chris Farley as Bartholomew Hunt, Eugene Levy as Guy Fontenot, Bokeem Woodbine as Jonah, and Lisa Barbuscia as Shaquinna. Most audiences have rated ""Almost Heroes"" negatively; the film garnered 14% on the Rotten Tomatoes meter.  However, among its ""fan"" audience, Farley's performance has been remembered favorably.

I, personally, do not think ""Almost Heroes"" is a great movie, but it does incorporate a lot of good light-hearted humor and many quotable lines.  This movie's downfall comes from a collection of sources; the screenplay can be a little boring and the chemistry among the cast just doesn't quite ""click.""  It is not one I watch often; when I'm in a Farley mood I usually go for ""Tommy Boy."" However, if you are a Chris Farley fan, I would recommend buying this DVD for nostalgic purposes and a few good laughs.  Below I have included a short summary of the plot in hopes that it might help anyone `on the fence' about whether to purchase the movie or maybe just rent.  Good luck!

SUMMARY:  This movie is a historical parody of the western exploration of the United States and territories undertaken by Lewis & Clark in the early 1800s.  In the ""Almost Heroes"" comedic rendition, Leslie Edwards is a respected and wealthy society-man who sets off to map the ""unknown"" United States beginning at the Missouri River and ending at the Pacific, racing against the more famous team lead by Lewis and Clark.  Bartholomew Hunt, Edwards's foil character, is a fumbling miscreant employed among Edwards' party as a tracker.  Along the journey, the wide separation between Hunt and Edwards narrows as Edwards finally loosens up, finding love where he thought he was looking for glory.

The fellowship appears to be doomed from the start when the audience is introduced to Edwards' bottom-of-the-barrel frontiersmen. Hopes for Edwards' expedition rise meagerly when the crew is joined by Shaquinna who presumably represents Lewis and Clark's Sacagawea.  Shaquinna, a young Native American, is instrumental in the party's mostly safe journey through the west; the ""mostly"" part imposed by the crew's antics and mishaps.  Ironically, Edwards' party beats Lewis and Clark's to the Pacific, yet in the interest of being ""Almost Heroes,"" the men decide they'd rather carry on exploring than presume they've found it all.",1382918400,2,2829,5.14410480349345
1200388,1,B00000EZRQ,Funny if you are 5 years old. Waste of money and time!  Even my 11 year old thought it was stupid. Perry is a bore!,1380672000,,115,3.6
1200389,4,B00000EZRQ,"I don't happen to be a Chris Farley fan (I'm a BIG Christopher Guest fan), so I have no basis of comparison re: Farley except SNL, but I thought he did a fine job.  I read many of the reviews, good and bad, before buying this.  I rarely buy movies I haven't seen, bought it on the strength of the good reviews, but mostly because it was directed by the inimitable Guest, since I've yet to see a film of his I didn't love.  While the script certainly isn't stellar, Guest and company just manage to redeem it.  Good cinematography, beautiful scenery,  adept direction and camera work, with enough sustained silliness to make it worth while.  No outright hilarity, for me, but plenty of smiles and chuckles (I thought the ""ear experiment"", Matthew Perry's reaction shots (fantastic, SO silly), and the glancing encounters with rivals Lewis and Clark were the best bits in the movie).

The young Perry is surprisingly good at double takes and grandiose buffoonery, the movie's glue.  He's a dandy initially WAY out of his depth, a visionary with a Johnny Depp-as-Edward D. Wood Jr.-like zeal, appeal.  Perry and Farley made a good team, plenty of chemistry there.  As others have said, the supporting players (many of my favorites) were uniformly excellent.  I really LIKED the people in this movie, especially Perry, thought they were what was best about it.  The only minor grumble I have is that a particular fave of mine, Eugene Levy, could scarcely shine in a small role as a creepy bad guy.

I liked the grand, sweeping How the West Was Won-style opening, with maps of the territory, Harry Shearer's deadpan voiceover narration, and stirring music- in fact, the music throughout was just splendid (a Guest hallmark), adding to the movie's tongue-in-cheek ""authenticity"" (there's a fine line between historical fact and sheer balderdash).  It may be slight, plot & gag-wise, but it's good-natured, good-hearted, with lots of visual appeal, great music, and winsome, loony characters who obviously enjoyed what they were doing.  I enjoyed it too.

And BTW, another good-natured send up (in this case, of government conspiracies, religion, and fairy tales), and a better film, actually, hilarious in spots, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trollhunter/dp/B004ZISVRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trollhunter</a>- it's wildy inventive, inspired, I loved it.

The days of Chris Farley's type of comedy left when he did, and this world has since moved on, it seems, to preferring more of a dry, quippy, intelligent humor. I saw this movie in the theater as a teenage girl when it first came out, and I can't remember if I left because of boys or the quality of the movie. Nobody does Chris Farley like Chris Farley, and this movie is just like any other he's done. He's a big, dramatic klutz, which makes him funny, if you like that sort of ridiculousness. So while boys (including the grown men who act like them) love this movie, when the husband picked this as a weekday night movie, I found myself something more important to do.

Could have been an unmitigated disaster, but manages to flow steadily and competently from one hilarious segment to another, while offering one of the strangest rewrites in American history imagineable.

1200446,4,B00000EZRQ,"Almost Heroes  (1998)  Chris Farley, Matthew Perry, Eugene Levy

Rated PG

This is a basically good natured comedy. It's a goofy spoof of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
Critics disliked it and movie goers bad mouthed it. I assume that's because it was not filled with nudity and profanity and sexual content.
The expedition's misfit explorers encounter vicious animals such as untrustworthy squirrels, geriatric but sleepy native Indians, white water rapids, playfully unpredictable and overly sensitive  Spanish conquistador explorers, and even a bit of romance with an lovely Indian maiden who wishes to help them in their quest. They also partake in extremely quaint fireside chats, among  other misadventures.
This happens to be a highly underrated comedy with a lot fewer crude jokes than I had anticipated.
A light-hearted fun time movie when your nieces and nephews are over for a slumber party, or you're had your fill of high speed cars and bodies exploding into senseless flames.",1357430400,,990,5.234177215189874

But consistently make poor judgements like deciding to boat up the Mississippi river instead of down. Comedic scenes ensue around ever corner.

1200467,2,B00000EZRQ,"If you like other Chris Farley and Matthew Perry films, then you will probably like this one (i.e., ""Tommy Boy"" or ""The Whole Nine Yards""). It is a lot of physical comedy and slapstick sight gags. It does not have much originality to it, except for a few pretty funny surprises. For most of the movie gags, you can see the punchlines coming a mile away. If you don't mind this and still find the same types of things funny no matter how many times you see them, then you will enjoy the film. The film does cater toward the typical sophmoric guy humor for the most part. The jacket even says ""crude humor"". The best parts involve Farley and Perry dealing with the crazy leader of wandering conquisadors; their final standoff with them is particularly funny, especially the unusual way they end up overtaking them.",1310083200,,812,4.568493150684931

Mathew Perry saves him from hanging, and its off to the great American west they go with their crew of misfits to try and beat Lewis and Clark to the Pacific ocean.

'Tommy Boy' is by far his crowning achievement on film and probably the only film starring Farley worth owning. This film shows Chris bloated and worn out from years of excess and is kind of hard to watch. It's a sad way to cap off a career that gave so many people joy.

1200491,4,B00000EZRQ,"This movie derives it's humor from a series of wacky frontier situations that are completely accepted as normal by everyone but Matthew Perry.

The cast of this movie is excellent, you'll recognize most of them from Christopher Guest's ""Mockumentary"" films, but also involved are some unknowns who really steal the show and support a shallow plot.

The film is full of memorable one-liners and one particularly funny monologue where a member of the group (Higgins) tells how he tricked his brother into eating sheep dung, then delights in revealing that he has no brother at all, it was HE himself, HE ate the sheep dung.

Another great performance is from Kevin Dunn as Hidalgo, a vain Spanish tyrant who tortures people that do not praise the beauty of his hair or ""the light that shines from within"".

And of course, Eugene Levy as the cowardly and incompetent French linguist Guy Fontenot, whose facial expressions revealed behind a giant mustache are absolutely hilarious.

The only problem with the movie is maybe too many main characters, as Jonah the man-servant and the Priest really don't serve any purpose or offer any laughs during the course of the film.

1200507,5,B00000EZRQ,"Chris Farley and Matthew Perry team up in Almost Heroes to re-write the history books. Farley's last film appearance before his unfortunate death, Almost Heroes captures the actor's physical comedy that made him so great in his earlier films (Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverly Hills Ninja).

The typical American knows that at the turn of the 19th century president Jefferson commissioned the well-known explorers Lewis and Clark to survey the western frontier. But what we don't know, as the beginning of the film suggests, is that Jefferson also commissioned a second team of explorers, Edwards and Hunt, in what becomes a race to the Pacific Ocean. Edwards, played by Matthew Perry, comes from the upper strata of American high life and is the brains behind the operations, while Hunt, played by Farley, is a second rate tracker and man of the frontier. In their comedic quest to the West, both Edwards and Hunt's skills are essential to their survival--as each man saves the others life at key points in the film.

As Edwards proclaims during the expedition, ""Lewis and Clark will be a footnote to a footnote, and I will be a note."" So who wins the race to the West, you are probably wondering? I can only suggest for you to sit back, relax, and watch the film, ready to laugh uncontrollably at this spoof on Manifest Destiny.",1149292800,,1328,4.794759825327511
1200508,4,B00000EZRQ,"Almost Heroes is a crack-up comedy starring the late SNL castmember Chris Farley (Tommy Boy), Friends star Matthew Perry, Eugene Levy (American Pie), and Kevin Dunn (Stir Of Echoes).

This light-hearted funfest set in 18th century America follows a group of explorers led by Leslie Edwards, played by Perry, who is attempting to discover the west before Lewis and Clark get there. Along for the journey is an obese and short tempered Bartholomew Hunt, played hysterically by Farley, a gorgeous Native princess Shaquinna, played by Lisa Barbuscia, her nasty French hubby Guy Fontenot, played by Levy, and a group of imbeciles.

Almost Heroes was Chris Farley's last bang of non-stop laughter; he died only five months before the movie's theatrical release.

1200509,5,B00000EZRQ,"When you learned about Lewis+Clark in school, you thought it was just another boring lesson. However, after watching this movie, you will never think of Lewis+Clark the same way, in fact you will see it more like Edwards+Hunt.

""When the history books are written, Lewis and Clark will be nothing but a footnote on a footnote and I [Edwards]sir will be the....NOTE.""

The chemistry that Hunt and Edwards share in this movie is tremendous, something that makes this movie as funny as can be. With the help of some no so bright helpers, Edwards and Hunt conquer the Pacific. With some misfortunes along the way that make this movie the best, I especially like the ""I need the egg of an eagle"" scene, hilarious, and the Indian scene where the ""NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD"" indian keeps slapping Hunt (Farley) no matter if it is he or Edwards that slaps the Indian.

So get out your wallet use the force of the credit card to order this comedy of a lifetime, it is worth the ride. TRUST ME

1200511,4,B00000EZRQ,"Perhaps this is low brow moviemaking at its finest.  Just picture a film about Lewis and Clark type explorers with lots of brainless juvenille humour and with a fun, adventurous spirit.  Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but if you can watch it in the right frame of mind you'll really laugh at some genuinely memorable scenes.  Directed by comedy genius Christopher Guest and also Chris Farley's final film.  What took so long for this movie to be released to DVD?",1125360000,7,464,4.691358024691358
1200512,5,B00000EZRQ,"Sometimes you see a movie and months later you have a good laugh just recalling a scene.  This is one of those movies.

Good-natured adventure and definitely silly, it makes you wish we still had Chris Farley around to entertain us.

1200513,5,B00000EZRQ,"When I say this movie is just as good as Tommy Boy, I don't mean to say that Chris Farley is better in this movie than he is in Tommy Boy. Far from it. This movie is just as good as Tommy Boy because such a great cast supports Chris and Matthew Perry. Guy Fontenot is a riot, and Higgens and Bidwell, in my opinion, steal the show. Not to mention Pratt, Jackson, and Hidalgo. I think many of the bad reviews this movie gets are due to the fact that Chris Farley is not at his comedic best (although the fearsome beasts speech ranks among his greatest moments) and he does not dominate the movie as he did with Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Watch this movie a few times, however, and you will begin to focus more on the role players, who elevate this movie to a comedic classic. Higgen's story, Pratt's experiment, Bidwell's itchy nose, and ""There's an animal now!"" are some of the greatest movie moments of this past decade. I understand that the sophomoric humor prevalent in this movie is not for everyone and certain highbrows will look down on this movie, but that if they cannot let down their pretensions once in a while, that is their mistake. Do not underestimate this movie. It is delightfully funny.",1121904000,22,1206,4.4125560538116595
1200514,4,B00000EZRQ,"Chris Farley did an awsome job in this movie and knew exactly what made us laugh. You get all of the sounds and facial expressions we enjoyed on SNL as he plays an illiterate adventurer, Bartholomew Hunt. Matthew Perry plays a rich guy, Leslie Edwards, as they team with a hilarious crew to beat lewis & Clark in finding a pathway to the Pacific through the Louisiana territory.

There are so many memorable scenes from the movie, I hate to ruin a single one for anybody. One scene already mentioned includes Hunt needing to find the egg of an eagle...classic farley in that scene. Guy Fontenot, played by Eugene Levy, is actually one of my favorites as he is recruited into the group after claiming to know the languages of all of the natives they would encounter on their journey...lol

This movie is actually one of the better comedies I have seen in a long while. I am glad I was among the few that have been familiar with it for a long time. I showed it to a few friends years ago and they had never heard of it and thought it was hilarious. It simply didn't do well at the box office, partially due to its release being so close to the untimely death of Chris farley. It is a shame because this was one of his best and a great overall comedy. I don't think anyone was in the mood to laugh at that time. RIP Chris Farley.",1120521600,,1326,4.278884462151394
1200515,4,B00000EZRQ,"Christopher Guest has been responsible for subtler comedy that works on a different level (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, This is Spinal Tap), but manages a lesser effort here.  I recall reading that there were a lot of problems on the set with actors not always being sober or timely, and that might have weakened the movie, but there are some real laughs to be found in this film.

On a separate note, I have glanced at the other reviews and cannot believe that people who can't spell or write a proper sentence would be so bold as to write lengthy reviews.",1119398400,4,557,4.398058252427185
1200516,5,B00000EZRQ,"Now Im not gunna write this with the ""Im the biggest Chris Farley fan in the world"" attitude........oh wait yes I am cause I am.....This movie Is one of the best Farly movies of the short collection It has a very young Matthew Perry(the friends guy) Ugine Levy(embarassing American Pie Dad) and a host of other really goofy characters. While watching this movie you get a couple of ""what.....what just happend"" moments and you are left stunned at the weirdness Farley and crew bring to His ultimatly last staring role feature film. It tells the story of two explorers of the manifest destiny of the united states and if your thinking a crappy louis and clark remake Wrong its the tale of Edwards and Hunt out to beat louis and clark and be the first to reach the pacific but along the way there is a drunkin madman(Farly) a few straw prostitutes, the search for an eagles egg(Farlys amazing during this part) and stories of the wilderness. Although it was a box office disaster this dvd is a must have for any true Farley fan. If u want a quick laugh and don't care too much for farly then why did u read this far go back to the day after tomarrow movie cause your thoughts are probably ""God this guy is dumb how can anyone watch this stupidity"" well Ill tell u why Cause I like to laugh at a fat man-------peace out peeps",1117843200,,1322,4.4
1200517,4,B00000EZRQ,This movie came out in 1998 but due to some contract issues it was not put on DVD till 2005. I saw this movie about a year ago on WS laserdisc.  This is the story of the qwest of hunt (farley) and  edwards (perry). Their qwest is to beat lois and clark to the west coast. While on this qwest they come across many obstructions which result is some very funny moments. One moment  I recall is when hunt has to retrive the egg of an eagle. Now all he has to do is get the egg. But he insted is atacked buy the eagle and eats the egg many times.its to bad farley passed away shortly after this movie as he could have done so much more. I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.,1116460800,,670,3.8405797101449277
1200518,4,B00000EZRQ,"Well, Chris Farley did not look good or sober here.  Kinda sad to see him in this state, but don't let that stop you.

Almost Heroes gets funnier with each viewing and ol' Chandler, while no David Spade, really holds up his end of the bargain.  The wide array supporting characters along for the adventure - including a hard to spot Eugene Levy - are always interesting and get some of the best lines.

If your a guy hanging out with friends and too stressed by mid-terms(or whatever) I would recommend this one.  It gets funnier with more beer.  I happen to laugh at slap-happy humor, not everyone does.  I thought the actor performance was great, I mean I couldn't act like that.... and I've been known to do some pretty goofy things.  If you can't laugh at this movie, I might suggest that you take movie watching a little too seriously.  Don't expect an oscar winner, just kick back and grab a drink(or two) and chill out.

1200524,1,B00000EZRQ,"I saw this one on television recently, and if there was ever a ""no star rating"" this would get it (At least from me) Period comedies seldom work,(HISTORY OF THE WORLD, etc) especially when there are absolute no talents like Chris Farley and Perry. (Supposedly this was Farley's last film, he should have quit a LONG time ago)It is NOT funny or even mildly amusing, just a load of overdone juvenile humor and labored slapstick. Trying to turn the Lewis and Clark expedition into a joke was a major waste of time and money, which is what YOU will experience if you buy this tripe.",1094169600,,578,4.514285714285714
1200525,3,B00000EZRQ,"Did you know that there was ANOTHER 'Corps of Discovery' (of sorts) vying with the more famous Lewis and Clark expedition in a race to the Pacific?  Well, no, but that's the premise of this film.

Farley is a lot of fun in this film, playing Bartholomew Hunt, sidekick to Matthew Perry's Leslie Edwards.  Edwards, the leader of the expediton, runs into all sorts of predictable mishaps that threaten to derail their attempt to beat Lewis and Clark to the Pacific.

A couple of those challenges include running a stretch of white water that puts a damper on their whole enterprise.  Later, they run into Spanish troops who want to keep the Americans from expressing a claim to the Pacific Northwest.

Farley (along with the scenery) is the reason to watch this film.  He's at the top of his extremely funny form (how too short was his life!) in Almost Heroes.  The scenes with the bald eagle are really funny.

Lisa Barbuscia as Shaquinna also deserves a mention.  In a supporting role, she does a good job as the Indian woman who helps the group along.

Mildly recommended for a popcorn film with the kids.",1093651200,5,1106,4.62051282051282
1200526,3,B00000EZRQ,"What a great concept for a flick.  Attempting to beat Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the Pacific Ocean.  Being this is the 200th anniversary of that expedition made it a little interesting.
There are some very funny scenes indeed but Farly is Farly, yelling, getting angry, fighting and fussing.  If you like that you will love this.  My favorite scene is where he faces the Eagle at her nest.  ""Why didn't you tell me you only wanted the shell?""  What a great one liner.
Perry is a little stiff as a character and is more of a straight man to Farly's funny man.  My only problem with the movie is that there are too many places where it gets slow.  Part of it is because you are in the wild and it was a slower time.
There are so many great one liners that seem to have too much time between them.  The inuendos are a bit much especially at the beginning.  The older Indians are just great.  And the scenery, especially of the Tetons and the Snake River are outstanding.
If you want to have a fun night with mostly the guys this is okay for that.  My wife did not like it.  Anyone who knows and liked Farly for his antics and his in character concept, you will just think this is a hoot.",1089763200,,1196,4.192982456140351
1200527,4,B00000EZRQ,"This was Chris Farley's last film. He ended on a high note. The movie is intentionally stupid--a hilarious GOOF--and directed by Christopher Guest (known for having directed ""This is Spinal Tap."") They surely weren't pushing for an Oscar with this one - merely encouraging laughter. This is the story of Bartholomew Hunt (Chris Farley) and Leslie Edwards (Matthew Perry) who, in 1804, follow explorers Lewis and Clark, in hope of being the first men to see the Pacific Ocean. Along their journey they're sure to bring laughter to true fans of Farley's ways, and perhaps to fans of Mel Brooks' as well, as some of the comedy is similar to Brooks' humor in ""Robin Hood - Men in Tights.""
It is a real shame that this movie isn't available on DVD (yet,?) because the presentation of it on VHS is awful. I quote the fine print on the back of the tape's case: ""This film has been modified as follows from its original version: It has been formatted to fit your screen."" The picture is zoomed in WAY too far, and the result looks distorted. In many shots heads are cropped, we sometimes see only approximately 75% of the face of the person who speaks, and at one point, where a sign reads ""Welcome to Snakes Bend,"" we only see ""elcome to Snakes Ben."" I was hugely disappointed by the film's presentation, but surprised by the quality of comedy since this is not a much talked about movie.
Zero points to he who decided to crop the movie, and full points to whomever releases it on DVD (with OPTIONAL formatting.)",1082246400,3,1505,4.5777777777777775
1200528,5,B00000EZRQ,"Is this movie dumb? You bet! But I love it. The dumber ""the better"" I always say. Well sometimes. Farley and Perry play off each other quite well with their own styles of comedic humor in this interpretation of the Lewis and Clark exploration. But then so does the whole cast of zany characters in this whimsical historical tale. Some of the situations and lines of dialog are absolutely stupid, but they are just so funny in their own way.

Not that his movies with David Spade did not have their charm, but the supporting cast in this movie, (all fairly obscure actors and actresses except for Matthew Perry), made this movie spectacular. At times yes, the comedy is silly, perhaps even stupid, but clever Farley'isms combined with a never ending supply of slap stick moments, make this movie tireless in it's abilty to make the viewer laugh.

I will tell you one thing about it - watch it more than once. Once you begin to watch it 10+ times the smallest things become so funny. Not only is Chris Farly funny as hell but the rest of the cast is what makes the movie. There is a shy scrub named Bidwell, a funny old man named Jackson, a funny fat man named Higgins, and the best of all the scrubby dude named Heronumus Pratt, he is the best. Watch the scene where Matthew Perry is watching the girl take a bath in the lake and when Chris Farly comes up. He starts joking about Matthew Perry watching her alone and polishing the puter etc. but watch Matthew Perry's face, he cannot keep a straight face, all he does is laugh at Chris Farly for real. It is one of the most hilarious scenes in any movie. Like I said earlier its one of those movies that you should watch 5-6 times and then you will be addicted to it.
