2056808,4,B00022PYZW,The high def is somewhat of a letdown though - it seems very grainy and not nearly as good as some of the more recent blu-ray releases.,1216425600,,135,4.037037037037037
2056809,5,B00022PYZW,From a teacher's point of view...worthwhile for the student generation.  I saw this in the IMAX theatre and encouraged my 5th graders to go see it with their families. There is great info in there to complement the science curriculum and therefore it is an excellent addition to any life or earth science teacher's bag of classroom extras. It is full of scenery that most 10 year olds will not likely encounter in the real world and shows them where a science career could take them. The narrators encourage kids to keep up with the research via their websites...a productive use of time if a child surfs the net anyway. The photography was breathtaking...I wish it were longer.,1215561600,,678,4.745762711864407
2056810,1,B00022PYZW,"This video was a disappointment.  I purchased the video to see beautiful cave scenery, not someone hanging off the side of a mountain. The focus should have been on the caves and the scenery within, NOT on the people making the video.  The title was very misleading, plus one disk, you have to play on a computer which I did not know at time of purchase.  I though I was buying a DVD video with two disk (must check product description closely). Wish I could return it for a refund.",1193011200,9,482,4.333333333333333
2056811,4,B00022PYZW,"The DVD is magnificient but the WMV Disc is problematic

all the demos work fine but the full lenght movies 720 format and 1080 formats will only work if the computer is ""fully"" compatible with the ""windows"" DRM system.

if your video card or your monitor or your soundcard is not an approved piece of hardware be prepared to be dissapointed or fork out a lot of money for the DRM approved replacements

I am one of the Dissapointed ones because the sound card built in to the motherboard of the computer is not acceptable to the movie DRM",1171411200,4,539,4.424242424242424
2056812,5,B00022PYZW,This was a great adventure the documentary is the most beautiful I have ever seen! It really gives you great appreciation for MOTHER EARTH!  MUST SEE! AMAZING!!!!,1121817600,2,162,5.0
2056813,1,B00022PYZW,"This is the most misleadlingly (is that a word?)titled movie I have ever seen. Amazing caves? What caves? The first 15 minutes of this reletively short 40 minute film don't take place in any cave. All they do is talk about them. Then when they finally enter a cave they are there for a few seconds. The few and far between cave scenes are interspersed with lots kayaking scenes, laboratory scenes, and classroom scenes. Was this film funded by the pharmasutical industry? The lead scientist in the film is always saying how she does this cave dwelling stuff to find exrtremophiles that will create new cures for diseases. Blechh! I wanted a movie about caves that showed beautiful caves. Granted, the latter half of the film provided more cave time but it was too little too late with too much of an environmental-disease-curing propaganda feel to it than I could stomach. It should have been titled ""How To Search for New Cures in a Few Caves while Being Environmentally Conscious."" Somehow I don't think that title would have sold many IMAX tickets or DVD's.",1118707200,59,1060,4.766304347826087
2056814,5,B00022PYZW,"First off, the image quality of the HD disk is incredibly impressive.  Yes, you need to have a PC hooked to an HDTV, but with the popularity of the new Media Center Edition (MCE) computers, this is much more mainstream than it was a year ago.  I was an early adopter of the MCE system and I think it's the only way to watch High Definition DVD's.

As to the program itself, this is one of the funnest DVD's to watch over and over again.  There's not too much of a story, but the music, narration, and cinematography is completely captivating. The underwater scenes and ice cave sequences are beautiful. I have two small kids, and they would much rather watch this than Nickelodeon.",1102896000,8,681,4.467741935483871
2056815,4,B00022PYZW,"I purchased this video to supplement a class I am teaching about caves.  It's a great video, just not quite the right age range for me.  Definitely enjoyed it though and would recommend it for anyone ages 8 and up.",1410739200,,214,4.325
2056816,1,B00022PYZW,"It's okay.  The second disk does not work, it keeps showing error.",1409616000,,66,4.5
2056817,5,B00022PYZW,"Well done. Artistic filming, informative . Would have liked to see more inside caves. Gives a thought and view of caving I did not know before",1397952000,,142,4.5
2056818,5,B00022PYZW,"great action in the safety of my home; never want personally go splunking but this is an adventure.
whole family loved it from 74 to 4",1391558400,,134,4.1923076923076925
2056819,5,B00022PYZW,"Wow, this is so cool and informative.  It takes you all over the world and with awesome picture quality you feel like you are there.",1384646400,,132,4.28
2056820,5,B00022PYZW,"Being a caver myself I found this video very inspiring.  I recommend it to everyone.  There are many movies around about caves and Hollywood doesn't do justice to any cave.  If you ever want to go caving go to people who are responsible, but watch this video first.",1356912000,2,265,4.479166666666667
2056821,3,B00022PYZW,"Without question, this may be some of the most spectacular filming I have ever seen. I don't think filming of even the space station is more spectacular. Unfortunately, one only sees about ten minutes of such spectacular scenes.  I saw the IMAX 38-minute version, but not the DVD version for sale on Amazon. I will probably get the DVD at some point, just for archival purposes.

There must have been a lot of film left on the ""cutting floor"" as they say. I believe the DVD has a ""how the documentary was made"" feature. As usual with these documentaries, one wonders how the cameraman/woman got to the various locations to get such incredible shots. I assume that in some cases, the two cavers set up the camera and then re-enacted their entrance to the cave. If so, I am amazed with what a hand-held (?) camera can capture. There was no suggestion that a third camera person went ahead of them.

But I digress. Ten minutes of incredible footage; incredibly juvenile story line. Caving to find bacterial to cure human disease is too ... blechhhh - as someone else posted.",1349740800,,1071,4.626315789473685
2056822,5,B00022PYZW,"This is a very-very good documentary with vivid and extraordinary images of our surrounding nature. It's a fact that I like caves but in this case the item's title is well establish. These are amazing caves, beauty sites, minde-blowing views... a dangerous but irresistible world of beautifullness.",1278633600,,298,5.361702127659575
2056823,3,B00022PYZW,"Some magnificent footage, but extremely simplistic narration, as if made for young children. As a video of pretty and amazing nature picture goes, not bad, especially if you've never seen that deep into a cave (the ice caves were neat to see), but as a documentary, I'd give it no more than two stars and probably only one.",1232841600,,323,4.586206896551724
2056824,5,B00022PYZW,"For anyone into caving or just wants to learn about caves, this video is great.  We have watched it 4 times already and the photography on it is amazing.",1232150400,,153,4.275862068965517
8020825,1,B00022PYZW,"The only way to watch this video is to have a Windows Media Player 9 Series, you cannot play it on a regular DVD player or a PS3.  This information should have been added so that everyone will know what you need to play it.",1494720000,,223,3.9555555555555557
8020826,5,B00022PYZW,I love this movie! The caves are gorgeous!,1493769600,,42,4.375
8020827,2,B00022PYZW,There is barely any caves in this video. Most of the time is spent watching how people get to caves.,1490918400,,100,4.05
8020828,5,B00022PYZW,good deal.,1451260800,,10,4.5
8020829,4,B00022PYZW,"After traveling to Cancun and experiencing some cenotes of our own, we just had to learn more about these interesting formations. The move is a little dated, but the images are spectacular. We loved this short movie that reminded us of our wonderful trip to Mexico!",1435363200,,265,4.782608695652174
8020830,5,B00022PYZW,Great! The additional feature on how this was made really added a lot to the video.,1434758400,,83,4.25

8020832,4,B00022PYZW,fast shipping item was as described,1424995200,,35,5.0
8020833,4,B00022PYZW,"I saw the movie at IMAX, and I found it pretty enjoyable from a standpoint of ""IMAX thrills"", that kind of dizzy feeling you get when the camera pans and rotates in open space. Its not one of the best IMAX movies but better than the last couple I've seen. Its true the plot is rather lame, but I don't go to IMAX for plot, I go for that vertigo effect. I can see why people would be disappointed watching it on a small screen. I don't know why you'd want to view an IMAX anywhere but in an IMAX theater. If you can see it that way, its worth going to, although more caves would make it even better.",1424822400,,598,3.9916666666666667
