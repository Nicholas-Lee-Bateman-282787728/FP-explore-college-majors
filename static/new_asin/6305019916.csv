7881031,4,6305019916,"For those who haven't seen this movie, there is one easy way to descibe it, action packed. The story is very close to that of the first Godfather, just add in the kung fu. Fans of Billy Chong will not be disappointed in this film. Carl R Scott also does an excellent showing in this movie. The picture quality and sound were very good. If you watch this one and like it I would also recommend ""A Hard Way To Die"" with both Chong and Scott. Fans of Billy Chong might also want to pick up ""Super Power"" my all time favorite of his.",1032393600,3,529,4.096153846153846
