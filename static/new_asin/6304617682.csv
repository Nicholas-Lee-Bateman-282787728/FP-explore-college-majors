It has many tearful moments, and overall this is a true classic. I really recomend it.",1192060800,,297,4.730769230769231
914346,4,6304617682,"I watched this movie twice in a row and cried most of the way through it both times. I had borrowed it from a high school student in a class that I substituted, and although my Spanish isn't that good, I loved it! Too bad there isn't a soundtrack! I am a true blue Alex fan ever since I heard him sing the first note of the first song, and I was thrilled to see this movie. Although I wasn't very big on his father, after watching the movie, I am now a fan of his as well. My student recommended that I look here to buy it, because I have looked unsuccesfully in all the local stores.",1044316800,2,584,3.957627118644068
914347,5,6304617682,"Es lo mejor que se puede ver en un DVD, a dos grandes estrellas de la musica Mexicana. Relata una historia conmovedora que muchos o casi muchos tienen la anegdota de haberla vivido. La magia digital a plasmado a estos dos grandes en formato DVD. No se puede dejar de apreciar el audio de *Cuando Yo Queria Ser Grande* tema principal de la pelicula....",1016668800,4,351,4.5
914348,4,6304617682,"I LOVE THIS SOAPY MOVIE !!! Made in '91, it's tender, sweet, funny (not  always intentionally) and very touching.
It stars the legendary Vicente  Fernndez, and his son, the one and only Alejandro. He's so young here  (20), and looks like an angel and sings like a god...and OH ! How those  coal black eyes can WEEP !!! I've never seen a man cry like this on  screen...he gets me sobbing along with him in the last scene...
YES !  REAL MEN CRY !!!!
Then there's the music ! The central song is  ""Cuando Yo Queria Ser Grande"" which is so incredibly  moving...first a magnificent rendition is sung by Vicente, then at the end  by Alejandro (it's my favorite track on his debut CD). ...and don't miss  the short ""gym"" scene ! So cute.
Make note that this does not  have subtitles, however, the dialogue is quite simple and all of it is so  beautifully spoken that it would be a good film for a student of the  language.",969235200,5,915,4.34319526627219

7876126,2,6304617682,"I ordered this because it is supposed to have English subtitles. It does not. So I do not understand anything except that the movie looks rather amateurish, although the Fernandez guys, father and son, sing well. I bought it because I like the Alejandro voice, but sadly, this one was not possible to watch. Would not have bought it if the Amazon information on the site had been correct.",1328572800,,388,4.63768115942029
