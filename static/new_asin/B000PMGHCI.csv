The artist is good in painting the skin how ever there is little done on painting the clothing. This compliments Suzanna Winton's book ""Realistic Watercolor Portraits"" that explains the techniques step by step on writing and in pictures.",1296172800,2,389,4.909090909090909

8192668,5,B000PMGHCI,"Zoe's painting demonstrations are wonderful! They're very informative, clearly detailed and very good photography. You can actually see what she's doing. The paintings are very beautiful, and this particular DVD actually has 3 demonstrations on it. The 3rd one being a young boy. This is a very talented painter, and her demonstrations are well worth the money. I was hesitant to buy these as there were no reviews and little description, but they're just wonderful. You can see more of her paintings at [...] I love the color that she uses. This is a great one to watch over and over and a wonderful addition to your library.",1218240000,14,626,4.805555555555555
