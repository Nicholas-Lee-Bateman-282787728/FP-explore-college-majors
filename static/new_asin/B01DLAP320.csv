8756378,4,B01DLAP320,"This is a two part TV series. John and Peter Gomez witness their mother being killed in the streets of East LA in a drug gang cross fire. John sees the man clearly. As an adult John (Ricky Saenz) becomes a cop who uses vigilante techniques in order to get to the top dog, the man who killed his mother. Working against him is Internal Affairs and his brother Peter (Carl Garcia) who has moved on.

This was an enjoyable ""bad"" cop film. It was long enough to build characters, but never really developed complexity. A straight forward film with no twists. I couldn't help think about one US Presidential candidate John Gomez he describes these people as ""rapists, drug dealers, and murderers.""
