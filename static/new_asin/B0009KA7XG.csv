As much funny as low budget movie might provide even if Los Angeles landscapes inserted.",1233964800,2,183,4.903225806451613
2299415,4,B0009KA7XG,"I love this movie.  It is one of those rare films that you can love while objectively realising that there are flaws in its making...its overall feel of delighted angst is bright and pleasurable.
The characters are quirky and real and their dialogue is to die for.  There really aren't any characters that don't seem to do their very best - even the minor characters shine when given the opportunity.
Actually, my very favorite moment in the movie is when Amy and a certain person are getting it on upstairs in her parents' house (gutsy!) and he is bouncing around on her so vigorously that the windows are rattling...her parents think there is an earthquake, so her(ever timorous) mother comes to the foot of the stairs and calls tremulously ""Amy....? Are you under a doorway?""
I do think certain parts could have been shot better - for example, the love scene between Amy and the OTHER certain person (you don't see ME spoiling the whole damn movie for others!) is a long, sexy one, but it is screwed up by being pieced together in an odd, choppy fashion.  One minute she is topless, the next minute you see him take off her shirt.  Also the music during this scene is so bouncy, almost humourous...it's hard to believe that the couple is as into each other as you later learn that they are.
Other than that scene, I think the music is well-chosen and happy, it was a pleasure to hear such high-quality independent artists.
All in all, fun, fun, fun!
Except I REALLY wanted to kick Mishnu's ass.",1127347200,8,1497,4.574626865671642
2299416,5,B0009KA7XG,"Monkey Love is such a fun title and an equally fun movie.

Get ready for the unexpected and make sure you have

your popcorn ready for a fun evening.

I loved Amy and William Sanderson, too! He was in

Blade Runner,  which is also a fave of mine.

I loved the MUSIC....

Hopefully the CD will be released soon, too, because I would buy it today.",1122940800,3,345,4.136363636363637
2299417,4,B0009KA7XG,"Well, I got this on DVD today.

The movie is more or less what I expected - a lightweight rom-com aimed at the teen/twenty-something market. Not so heavy on the comedy, but enough scenes that make you smile, with some good, realistic dialogue.  I liked Amy Stewart's character, and wanted to see things work out for her.

*SLIGHT SPOILER* I'm not sure why the whole psycho-dad thing is in there, and some of the secondary characters (Amy's parents, Mishnu, Brie etc) could have been explored before the end of the film to flesh it out a bit.  If you are a fan of Jeremy, though, he does have a sex scene... *END SPOILER*

Great for Jeremy fans obviously, because other than that he has lots of scenes. I am not going to say it is the best film I have ever seen, but then again I couldn't say that about Senior Trip or SWAT either and I still enjoyed watching them. All in all it is an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes with some popcorn.

All things considered, this would be a great movie for any self-respecting Jeremy fan to see, so I would recommend that you buy it.",1122854400,8,1070,4.325

8062930,1,B0009KA7XG,"I hate to give any movie one star but this one deserves it. Even brief moments of real acting couldn't save it.
Wow. With Jeremy Renner and Seamus Dever, this should've been fantastic.  It's not. The lead is a female character so shallow and stupid and melodramatic that I can't even tell if the actress was any good. She's utterly forgettable and completely insulting to women as a character. Seamus Dever's character is a cartoon as well and while he fares slightly better than Amy Stewart, maybe because Dever can invest thinly written characters with real life (see his work in Castle), it's still far less than an actual person. Because the people don't seem even faintly plausible, all the interaction is preposterous and not amusing or goofy enough to be engaging except for a scene between Renner and Dever where both display actual emotions and one scene with Amy Stewart and Renner where again, emotions seem real and as such, totally out of place in this film. Oh and there's one hot sex scene with Renner and Stewart that's very short and probably why people are renting this. The lead's plans and theories are annoying and selfish--I think it's meant to be funny and quirky but she's mostly just a reprehensible totally self-centered bitch. Everything she says sounds like it was written by a man, most especially the voice over which is supposed to let us inside her head. Um, guys? Women don't think like this. She has double standards, expects men to read her mind (okay some women are like that) and flip-flops so often and is so manipulative and self-serving, but without focus or pattern that she makes no sense as a human. All this is also set within a script that's trying so hard to be brainy and cute (and the lines get worse and worse as the movie goes on with the final denouement being the absolute worst melodramatic tripe I've heard in years) that it is nearly impossible to care about anyone, especially the lead, who is unlikeable and totally insensitive to everyone around her. The boys are written at a high school level despite the age of the actors, the video filming technique is steady and clean but very immediate and feels amateur because of it. The lead's motivations are slutty, self-serving, misguided and so artificial that even as a cartoon character it feels forced and the only chemistry is between the men as friends. It's a terrible waste of Dever and Renner, two excellent actors. I can't say about Amy Stewart because she had next to nothing good to do here. Overall, just a big hunk of soap-opera-colored,ultimately very stupid garbage. Too bad.
Oh yeah--and the conclusion is broadcast so early on that there isn't any real interest in watching the plot spool out. I think the writers knew this because they tossed in a whole slew of random, ridiculous stuff using side characters toward the end. None of it had anything valid to say to the plot or characters and didn't help the overall film in the least.",1338595200,2,2957,4.71953578336557
