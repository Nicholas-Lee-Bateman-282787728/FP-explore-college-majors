5777108,5,B00D7SHX8O,There method for teaching Two Step is excellent.  They teach you a Two Step routine that is very easy to follow. Have also purchase there other Dance DVD and have been very impressed with them. Excellent job Dean and Dawn!,1381708800,3,222,4.55
8590446,5,B00D7SHX8O,High level of teaching!,1526947200,,23,5.0
8590447,5,B00D7SHX8O,"These DVDs are step by step explanations with demonstrations.  Easy to follow.  Really don't like the music selection they used for the steps, and would have liked to see the steps applied to different songs but the instructions are clear so the patterns should transfer with some practice.  Went back and got some of the others by this couple after going through the first two.  Probably indicates that we got something out it.",1518825600,,428,4.821917808219178
8590448,4,B00D7SHX8O,"Great instructional video, I just wish they wouldn't talk over each other.",1484265600,,74,5.25
8590449,1,B00D7SHX8O,Very disappointed in this two step instruction dvd because of the immediate level jump in level of difficulty....extremely frustrating!  If you have been two stepping for a long time then there is intermediate material here for you but these two don't know the first thing about teaching beginners the basics.  I have been coaching tennis for over forty years and I speak from experience.  If I were teaching the two step I would group all the easiest moves together and teach those before jumping to difficult combinations.  The title of the DVD is LEARN TO DANCE....not with this dvd if you are a beginner,1437004800,2,607,4.8076923076923075
8590450,5,B00D7SHX8O,Great video for beginners or intermediate dancers looking to add to their skill set or even just work on some of their fundamentals.,1426723200,2,132,4.782608695652174
8590451,5,B00D7SHX8O,"I'm not sure I'll pursue ""Two Step"" any further, but I found the introductory instruction on this DVD to be very clear and easy to follow.  Nice job!",1399248000,2,149,4.321428571428571
8590452,5,B00D7SHX8O,"This DVD is the most fun yet!  We purchased this one after taking one of Dean and Dawn's group lessons near our home, and it was just like they were in our living room.  After a few practice sessions in our basement, we felt confident enough to head out for Cancun Cantina (a local C&W spot) and had a great evening actually ON the dance floor instead of just watching everyone else.  Add this one to your collection!!",1383004800,3,418,4.333333333333333
8590453,5,B00D7SHX8O,"Dean and Dawn are my favorite dance teachers.  They are both excellent instructors and you get both of them on video for the price of one.  If you can't take lessons from them in person, this is the next best thing.  You'll be two-stepping your way down the dance floor in no time.",1381968000,2,281,4.264150943396227
8590454,5,B00D7SHX8O,"I have been taking lessons from Dean and Dawn for years.  Their extensive knowledge and their talent for teaching are second to none!  Watching this DVD, it seems like they are in the room with you. Their explanations are clear and easy to follow....and they make it fun.  If you want to learn to dance, you cannot go wrong with this Two Step DVD.

See you on the dance floor!",1381881600,2,376,4.328571428571428
8590455,5,B00D7SHX8O,Bought the Two Step DVD along with West Coast Swing and it is awesome!! So easy to follow-would easily recommend to anyone! Very happy customer :-).,1381708800,,148,4.730769230769231
