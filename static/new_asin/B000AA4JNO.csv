8076808,2,B000AA4JNO,"In the description it should clearly state that not all of the episodes are included in this edition, There are 13 episodes total, and on disk 1 are 4 episodes, on disk 2, 2 episodes.",1457481600,2,183,4.257142857142857

8076811,1,B000AA4JNO,"lied about how long the dvds are. it is only 247 MINUTES. NOT 608 as is in the description. VERY disappointed. ALSO the day that i ordered this at 11.99 they lowered it a bit. and now just three days after I received it, it is listed at 8.49. VERY SAD will NEVER order from them again.",1300492800,,285,4.017543859649122

8076813,4,B000AA4JNO,"As far as TV series goes this is quite a facinating watch, the characters are compelling, the effects are excellent, and the story is engrossing.",1227312000,,145,4.84
8076814,1,B000AA4JNO,"What they have done is put new names on 2 DVD's and made it look like they are not part of the original Kingdom Hospital series.  ""Making the Rounds"" and ""Post Mortem"" are just the series broken down into two DVD's. I made the mistake of buying the whole series and the 2 DVD's and found out that I had 2 copies of the series.",1206057600,35,326,4.015384615384615
8076815,5,B000AA4JNO,"Loved it.  It is funny, spooky and a great campy mini series/movie.  You can tell from watching that the actors had a great time making it, too.  I recommend it to anyone who thinks Stephen King is just t-o-o-o-o scary to watch.  King's dark humor just oozes from this series.  I'm buying my own so I won't have to rent it anymore.",1145491200,2,331,4.274193548387097
8076816,4,B000AA4JNO,"I picked up the dvds today and have been watching them since I got home.  I didn't know there was another installment not yet released.  OH OCT 11TH, HURRY UP AND GET HERE! Stephen King is a master and he has done well with Kingdom Hospital.  Dark humor is right; I know I was laughing at times.  You can really feel the pain Mary is in and just want to jump into the TV and help her. Ok so I really don't like Stegman and hope he gets it in the end.  Is it Oct 11th yet?  As soon as I am done here I am placing my pre-order.  Enjoy the series, all.",1128211200,5,549,3.8053097345132745
