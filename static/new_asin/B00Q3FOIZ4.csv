6853865,4,B00Q3FOIZ4,"Im not a huge fan of reality programming. Yes, there are always exceptions to the rule but for the most part shows of this nature either place people in jeopardy in situations they would never attempt except to find fame and fortune or they feature the wealthiest yet worst behaved self-proclaimed celebrities to be found. Fortunately there are a few reality shows that offer obviously scripted reality shows that contain enough reality to give us a glimpse into the real lives of people while at the same time knowing with a nudging wink that it isn't totally this way. WHALBURGERS is one of those shows.

For those whove not watched the series yet its about the Wahlberg family from Boston, the two most famous of which are of course Mark who has starred in numerous movies and Donnie who not only acts in things like the series BLUE BLOODS but was a member of New Kids on the Block way back when. With the creation of this series other family members have become just as well known, in particular their mother Alma and their brother Paul.

Paul runs the Whalburgers restaurant that the family created in Boston. As the series has progressed so has the claim to fame of the restaurant which is in the process of growing and branching out to other cities, one of the running stories in the series with both brothers making life miserable for Paul, a born worrier. As he runs both the franchises first location as well as the nearby Alma Nove, the more high end restaurant the family owns, his two famous brothers find time to give him grief whenever possible. Its not bad things they do but more along the lines of pranks.

At the center of the show though its about family and the love that this family shares for one another as well as their friends. Where some people might achieve stardom and leave everyone behind, the Wahlberg brothers have made sure to take care of family and friends to this day. Thats what makes this series so enjoyable. Its the affection they all have for one another coupled with the pranks they play that makes them feel more accessible than most stars. This is a family that remembers where they came from.

In the second season there are several episodes that stand out. The first one for me is when Donnie is on tour with the New Kids reunion tour in England and his fianc (now wife) Jenny McCarthy calls Paul and asks him to come visit since Donnie is homesick. When he arrives it surprises Donnie and brings forth a well of emotions that his brother would drop everything to come cook for him and the gang.

Another episode has a current pop band show up to the restaurant. Paul knows that his daughter is a big fan of the group MKTO and uses his influence to get her a chance to meet the band. A father and daughter evening is the result and once again the affection this family has for one another is displayed for all to see.

I have little doubt that there aren't tensions that arise between family members in the Wahlberg clan. All families have those moments. I also have no doubt that we won't be seeing those on the series, but thats fine by me. In a world where there is so much wrong going on its nice to see a family thats not as dysfunctional as most in reality TV programming. Its not quite the Waltons but thats just fine. In fact it might be better. While we all might not be able to relate to the world tours or the premiere screenings of our latest siblings movie release, we can relate to the affection we have four our families. Thats what makes this show work.

I doubt that I will ever meet anyone involved in this show. I doubt that I will ever make my way to Boston or any of the other cities where one of their restaurants will open. But I know that with this release on DVD I can always pop a disc in and have a laugh, appreciate the love the family has for each other and end up with a smile on my face. If only more reality TV were this way rather than the trash most of it has become.",1431043200,2,3948,4.355978260869565
