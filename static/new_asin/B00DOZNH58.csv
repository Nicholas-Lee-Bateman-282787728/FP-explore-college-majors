5838845,4,B00DOZNH58,"First of all, let me just say that I am very happy that Nickelodeon and Shout Factory are basically releasing what I can sum up as love letters to us nostalgic nerds who grew up with the station and had fond memories of these shows when they were on the air. First, Rocko's Modern Life, then Angry Beavers, and now this, one of the classics from Klasky-Csupo's heydays.

Truth be told, I almost forgot the show, only remembering bits and pieces from it, but I like the fact that I now have a collection of the series to watch at my discretion and catch up. And just like the other two DVD sets before, it's presented perfectly. A simple open and shut case, with a flipbook style presentation for each of the DVDs. And on the DVDs themselves, there were no annoying advertisements that plague so many DVDs nowadays. You know what I mean - you have to sift through several ads for upcoming movies before you can watch what you want, as if you're not paying for the DVD already. Shout Factory does not have this problem, and I am so grateful for it.

As of this writing, I currently have all three DVD collections lined up on my shelf, eagerly awaiting the Danny Phantom Collection coming out in January. Shout Factory, keep up the good work, and please, don't change a thing.",1385337600,15,1273,4.435897435897436
5838846,4,B00DOZNH58,"very good cartoon...it has a quality to it , that just is different. It reminds me of the type of yellow submarine thang.
Picture quality is good , but not high def. It is just a one of a kind series that nick just does not make anymore.",1385251200,,237,3.9583333333333335
5838847,5,B00DOZNH58,"always watched this show with my kids,loved it. Always made me and the kids laugh out loud. Nice animation for the whole family.",1384300800,,128,4.608695652173913
5838848,5,B00DOZNH58,"I remember when I first saw this show, how great! The show gets better as the seasons progress. I highly recommend this dvd collection.",1384300800,,135,4.666666666666667
5838849,4,B00DOZNH58,"I just purchased Aahhh Real Monsters complete series DVD on Saturday.  2013 marks the twentieth anniversary of the
  cartoon classic. I just started watching the first disc of the series. This is one of Nickelodeon's premier cartoon
  s in TV history. I like the scenes when the monsters frighten humans. This DVD box set is a definite must have for any
  retro cartoon fan.",1382227200,,374,4.75
5838850,5,B00DOZNH58,For some reason my kids liked this show.  It's not exactly cute and sweet but it wasn't one of those violent and hurtful shows that often show on tv.,1382140800,2,149,4.137931034482759
5838851,5,B00DOZNH58,I preordered this dvd and it came on the release day! It was in perfect condition and was one of my favorite cartoons growing up. A must have.,1381622400,3,142,4.107142857142857
5838852,5,B00DOZNH58,"After picking up Angry Beavers and Rocko's Modern Life's box sets, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one! Real Monsters is one of my favorite nicktoons of all time and thanks to Shout Factory, I can relive it all. Just pop a disc in and take a trip down memory lane.

If you ever watched this or any of the other nicktoons as a kid,, I highly recommend this!!",1381449600,,365,4.069444444444445
5838853,3,B00DOZNH58,"As stated above, season 4 will be a shoutfactory.com exclusive, but I'm sure people will sell copies here on amazon. If you're planning on getting season 4, make sure you check the price for this beforehand. The price for this could drop below 19.93 which is how much season 4 currently costs. If you don't want to wait for season 4, I'd suggest either waiting for this to go on sale and or selling your copies of seasons 1-3.
Now as for the show itself, I haven't seen all the episodes of this show, but I've watched almost all of the season 2 episodes. While it's original, an original show doesn't automatically equal a good show. I thought that some parts were funny, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a laugh per minute show. However, I think that most of the people that have seen this show would probably disagree with me. If you're still interested in seeing this show, I'd suggest checking out a few episodes before deciding whether or not to buy this.",1375315200,6,979,4.50561797752809

Anyone who thinks cartoons are just for kids, must have watched the wrong ones as a kid. I'll take silly cartoons over the graphic violence of movies any day. Safe to watch with kids, no swearing, bad graphics or things you'd regret letting a small child watch.",1484265600,2,436,4.395061728395062

I've spent the last few months purchasing all of the old 90's cartoon because it'll be a few years, but I want to have them when I decide to have kids of my own. So, this isn't the only series I've purchased recently. I've bought Doug, Hey Arnold, Are You Afraid of the Dark and Catdog, and those 5 are in sturdy, protective DVD cases, however it's the complete opposite with Aaah!!! Real Mosters, the case is flimsy and it was already broken when I received it. I considered sending it back, but regardless of the condition of the case, I'm still so ecstatic about having the series on DVD so I settled for a crappy case.

5839120,5,B00DOZNH58,Pretty good quality and the menus pretty unique. It's kind of simplistic but unique at the same time. The only issue I had was when you start up one of the discs it shows a cut version of the theme that I wasn't able to skip which was lame but the discs and the box look great it was definitely brand new looking and it's a great 90s cartoon that you know it's got me all nostalgic and what not lol.,1441324800,,399,3.9382716049382718

5839131,5,B00DOZNH58,"During the hiatus of Rugrats in the mid-1990's, Klasky Csupo made a new series, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters! As the complete series set's case says, this was one of Nick's flagship shows in the mid-1990's, alongside Rugrats and several other popular Nicktoons! Most of those Nicktoons only had 52 half-hour shows when they ended, even this one, except Hey Arnold had 100 and Rugrats with 172 in the end, not counting movies for the big screen or home video. Anyway, living at your own school ain't easy for the likes of Ickis, Krumm and Oblina, or their fellow classmates. The Gromble, their main teacher, teaches them all about scaring people and animals, while trying not to expose their world to just any human, especially Simon the Monster Hunter, who's always got designs on the monsters' hides (in other words, he's always trying to capture them, rat them out, and became famous). As ""Icky"", creepy and gross as this series may be, it proved to be a big hit, even today; in fact, the show started with its own Halloween episode, where Ickis and a human boy dressed like him switch places. It was around the time the show debuted that Tim Burton's macabre (""Muh-caw-bruh"" or ""Muh-cob"") Halloween/Christmas classic; The Nigtmare Before Christmas, came to home video for the very first time, adding to this show's popularity! AAAHH!!! Real Monsters concluded in 1997, paving the way for Rugrats' big revival starting with its own 4th season! But that wouldn't be the last time we saw the 3 main monsters or any of their cohorts; during Rugrats' 6th season, the monsters appeared in a crossover episode with the Rugrats themselves. If Shout Factory had the home video rights to Rugrats before this complete series release (and they still don't, as of Christmas 2015), the Rugrats episode Ghost Story would've made an awesome bonus program to this collection! This is still a great series of monster tales, behind Digimon of course, and neither show is sure no-way-in-Heck related to Pokmon, as far as I know. No matter what your favorite monsters are from overseas or from here, like Monsters Inc./University, if you have any, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters makes a worthy accompaniment to their DVD sets or those of other original classic Nicktoons from Shout Factory and Amazon! Incidentally, my copy of this set has a slightly-broken case when I got it in the mail, but not enough to make opening and closing it a hassle, just at the spine's outer edge where the front cover bends. RRAAWWRR!!!",1434585600,2,2485,4.877068557919622

5839148,5,B00DOZNH58,"I remember watching this cartoon as a kid. It was like something that was Halloween orientated but with a G-rated sense to it for kids. It's like this was the cartoon that made monsters cool, it made monsters cool and not scary. It was one of the best cartoons in the 90s to see as a kid. The monsters, the adventures, the humor and it was a good cartoon that was an original. It's hard to make another original now and I feel blessed to have gotten to see this as a kid. This was an old fashioned styled cartoon that is a classic and you can't beat the classics.",1428019200,,563,4.127272727272727
