These war-time movies are interesting for their outlook. Will there ever be a war to end war? No, human nature can never be at peace as long as some try to exploit others. But at least we can try. See the individual reviews for more details.

A Walk in the Sun, 1945
This was adapted from Harry Browns book of the same name. It tells about a day in an infantry mans life on a military operation. A walk in the sun was a phrase for an easy operation. These soldiers are sent to destroy a bridge behind the lines. They also destroy a machine gun nest in a farmhouse. Harry Brown became a screen writer and later worked on The Sands of Iwo Jima.

The North Star, 1943
This tells about a small village in Russia where people live a peaceful life. Suddenly it changes with an invasion of their country! Some will go into the woods and hills to fight as guerillas, others will stay behind and destroy resources that would be confiscated by the enemy. The enemy will do anything for their needs. Will this be the last war so people can make a better world?",1397001600,,1085,4.206730769230769
