I was born in 1961 just as he was learning and honing his trade, his gift. What a fantastic journey watching this collection. I'm so glad Peter included his commentary as he brings life and history to his photographs. I put the first disc in the afternoon it arrived and watched it straight through.  I did the same with disc 2 the following day. The images he captures through his lens are remarkable, beautiful, stunning! I will enjoy watching this collection again and again. Thank you, Peter, for sharing your fantastic photos with the rest of us!",1413763200,,667,4.75
8638829,5,B00I3SW3II,"Anyone interested in Photography,this DVD is a must to watch, it is fascinating to hear and watch Peter Simon""s life in photography. Seeing all his iconic photos and him talking about them is unbelievable. Very seldom do you see a

8638830,5,B00I3SW3II,"A casual walk by Peter Simons shop, or even a perusal of his website, might lead you to believe that the mellow Mr. Simons work is focused on his making images of beautiful places and handsome families.  In reality, those are just the tip of his photographic iceberg.  Through the past five decades, Mr. Simon has chronicled many of the significant moments in our evolving social and music scenes, from the anti-Vietnam War movement and Martin Luther King to Bob Marley and The Grateful Dead. His combination of uncommon access and practiced photographic skills generated iconic photographs of faces familiar to many of us. Now he has turned the camera on himself, in a warts and all self-interview with the tape running. This DVD is a must for anyone interested in reliving some of the pivotal moments of the past few decades..or just improving their own photography. I whole-heartedly recommend adding it to your home collection.",1406851200,,931,4.961538461538462
8638831,5,B00I3SW3II,"If the last name of photographer Peter Simon sounds familiar it is because he comes from a famous family. His father was Richard Simon,  the Simon in publisher Simon & Schuster, and his sisters include singers Lucy and Carly. This makes his James Taylors former brother-in-law and Ben Taylor his nephew.

Im sure the family wealth  and growing up on the family estate on Marthas Vineyard  provided financial support to Peter, but from the age of 6 he found he had a knack for photography (especially portraits and photo journalism.). He was in college in the 1960s and active in various antiwar and peace movements. Later on he started photographing musicians like the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Doors and, of course Carly and James. And he was living in same community as folks like Walter Cronkite  Many of his photos are well known and have served as album  or magazine covers.

Simon spends some of his time offering lectures about photography and tells the background stories of his photos. He calls this series Through The Lens. By producing the two-DVD set  its on his own label  Simon is able to offer his knowledge and the fruits of his labor to anyone with a DVD player. And since the content runs four hours, the viewer can watch it in segments. The program is divided into 12 lectures  plus a short Introduction. The section on celebrities is just one chapter. Simon was definitely into using marijuana and he has a whole chapter devoted to that and alcohol addiction. He covered both the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the Occupy movement of 2011 and devotes a full chapter to each of those.
Most of the time you get to see the photo full-screen with Simons narration on the audio but, periodically, you see him sitting at a microphone, as you would at a lecture.

I have to say that Im only 2/3 through the set (four hours is a lot) but I can certainly recommend it based on what Ive watched so far. Anyone interested in pop, rock and folk music, the sixties generation or just great photography, will find this set fascinating. And professional photographers will get an added bonus as he often (not always) shares his lighting tips. (Not enough to lose the casual viewer though.)

Sure this is a vanity production; Simon doesnt need the money. But I was really glad I discovered this release.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8638832,5,B00I3SW3II,"Okay, I'll be upfront about this:  Peter Simon is my little brother, and I am probably not the most objective reviewer, but indeed a very proud member of the family as Peter has become one of the great photographers of our generation.
 By the time Peter was 10, he was never without a camera.  Our father was a wonderful photographer, and this was a way of bonding with his Dad and, at the same time, developing his own vision of his world.  He followed his sisters, Carly, Joanna and me around, documenting our adolescence.  When we left home, his passion turned to our mother's dedication to civil rights, and he photographed demonstrations and speakers at neighborhood  events, all the while finding new angles, and developing a keener eye as he created his own style of capturing the players and moments in history.
Through the lens is a memoir of Peter's life as he traveled through the social and political stages of the last half of the 20th century and into the 21st.  It is formatted in chapters as a book might be and best experienced by watching a few chapters at a time rather than all at once.  Peter's chapters follow his particular passions: communal living of the sixties and spiritual searchings of the new age movement.  His love of music and musicians take him through the culture of Jamaican reggae and heroes of performing artists.  He has captured the wild beauty of Marthas Vineyard, the magical Island that is his home. All the way he comments on the images and gives photographic tips as he meanders through this unique history.",1399593600,,1553,4.697416974169742
8638833,5,B00I3SW3II,"Peter Simon has done a superb job of interweaving the tale of his life story with his deeply personal photography.  While many may know Simon for his celebrity photography, few will have prior exposure to his personal story which lays bare how his many highs and lows shapped his unique perspective and molded his art accordingly.  Throughout his narrative and photographic presentation what comes through is the artist's honesty and humility -- and how they are reflected in the landscapes, portraits and abstract images he has captured.  As an added bonus, tips on photographic composition are revealed.  Whether a photographer, a fan of photography, or a student of the human condition, the viewer will not be disappointed.  A triumpth!",1399420800,,739,5.176470588235294
8638834,5,B00I3SW3II,"For anyone looking for a concise tutorial on how to take great pictures, and as a bonus, a graphic history of the past 50 years, Peter Simon has provided a vivid and stunning package that will delight fans of the '60s, reggae, progressive movements (clothed and unclothed), and so much more of our shared experiences. Highly recommended!",1399420800,,337,4.9298245614035086
