8001007,4,B0000DG989,"This European DVD provides excellent visual pointers on the correct way to coach these two systems.  While not a comprehensive, stand alone source, the DVD works well with Wayne Harrison's book on the 4-2-3-1 system.  The reader will be ahead of the rest by taking time to use both of these resources.",1375315200,,301,4.769230769230769
8001008,5,B0000DG989,"really good dvd, lots of useful info. I'm a high school coach and know the game well but this was still a great resource unlike most of the coaching DVDs I get.",1242345600,2,160,4.03125
8001009,4,B0000DG989,The video is a little pedestrian at times and has low production value(like most soccer videos) but is insightful.  I like the tactical analysis of various formations and the situational problems that each systems of play creates against various formations. The narrations hightlight the problems that varrying formations will face against each other and provide potential solutions for overcomming these problems.,1188691200,3,414,5.786885245901639
