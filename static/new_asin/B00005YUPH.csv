7957361,4,B00005YUPH,"Episode 3 from the first DVD made me feel like this series was going to go somewhere.  Unfortunately, this second DVD does not live up to that premise.  The name of ""Soul Crusher"" was just too similar to the main character's ""code name.""  And the explanation of where Kyosuke comes from was extremely too coincidental for my tastes.
Strangely enough though, I want to keep watching this series.  The animation and colors create a darker mood than this viewer is used to from other animes.  That's the difference that I enjoy.  And I do want to find out where Runa is and if the mother is a ""good"" or ""bad"" person.  How will she be dealt with?  Although there are some negative aspects to this anime, I think you'll probably want to watch more after you've traveled this far.",1069804800,,774,4.517985611510792
