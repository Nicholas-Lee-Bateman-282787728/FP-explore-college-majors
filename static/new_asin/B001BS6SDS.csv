8284435,2,B001BS6SDS,"I wanted to review this movie for quite some time now. For the simple fact that I was scared of watching this tape, after watching a film something of this caliber, you feel almost ashamed at watching something like this because it's so grotestic. Man what can you say about a film about SNUFF (which if you don't have what idea a Snuff is, and it ain't the chew tobbaco, it's basicly a live/ recorded video of someone actually dieing/ being murdered and it's useally in low quality and sold Underground). Well this tape sure the hell feels like it's underground. Anyways the tape starts out with this damn FBI Flashing Warning for 5 Mins, it's like ""hurry up already!"". Then after that were greeted by z. 187 the narrator who acts of the host for the film. Then we get Gang Killing,Street Rioting,Car Cashes, and even the infamous death scene from the Twlight Zone Movie (1982... I think) which is worth checking out, it's pretty grousome the man saves this little vietamse girl from the jungle and the heli malfunctions and crashes and explodes right on them (yeeesh). Also there is another classic jem on the Tape, the other infamous Sea World Killer Whale Killing the Instructor, This is also pretty greusome she get's killed while people and childern watch as the instructor dies and water turns blood red. Other than that there is no reason to buy this tape. It's pretty sick and disturbing (even more disturbing than ""The Shock Of The Century). The only reason why I even thought of buying this thing is to see the Twlight Zone Movie Death (which I hope to upload to youtube soon). I am not sure but I think the company lied because on the tape they said that there is a Volume Green out there But Flatline Productions Have no history of making it (... Low sales...?). Anyway in short, stay way from this film, it quite honstly will disturb anyone (even any horror lover) Sure in the hell gave me nightmares for weeks (I rarely ever get scared I sat through Salo, and thought it was too hyped up and quite stupid not scary).I am giving it a 2/5 because of the Twilght Zone Death bit, and sure is a hell of a lot scarier than Faces of Death.",1296432000,,2147,4.493606138107417
