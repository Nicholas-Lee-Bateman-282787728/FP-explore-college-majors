2529700,5,B000EQH2PG,"I just got this DVD and have only tried a couple of the exercises. The first thing that strikes me is that Sonnon demonstrates beginning to advanced levels of each exercise. I think that most people (even who are out of shape) can do at least the beginning level exercises. The more advanced exercises will pose a challenge to many. One of my problems with yoga has always been that it is very difficult for beginners to do correctly. Some teachers may be good at helping people along, and there are props, but it can be so challenging that beginners who aren't flexible and strong already drop out.

The introduction to the DVD is really important and not fluff at all. I particularly love the way Sonnon draws a distinction between discomfort, effort, and correct form. I think confusion around this is why many of my friends have injured themselves in the gym.

I think a lot of people in the US also neglect areas of fitness - focusing on building muscle without flexibility or working cardio to the  detriment of muscle. Don't even get me started on the women who do endless thigh adductor exercises and do rapid tiny steps on stairclimbers - the muscle imbalances they are creating will bite many of them some day. Fitness, as defined academically by sports medicine professionals, includes strength, body composition, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and coordination. I think this program is well suited to work on each area of fitness.

Beyond the academic definitions of fitness there is the promised shortcut to reaching the flow state - as laid out by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This is where you become absorbed into what you are doing and reach a state of peak performance. While I have yet to work with the exercises in this video at length, I believe the combination of breathing practice, yogic exercise, and focus on internal states are a good way to reach flow. Sonnon suggests that working out 14-18 minutes with this program at the proper level of effort is enough to access the flow state and achieve a positive endocrine-immune system response. This is an absolutely reasonable assertion provided one follows the mental and physical suggestions given. It may takke a few sessions of learning the exercises before this is possible - but everything worthwhile takes effort.

I plan on working with the exercises along with my normal martial arts practice over the next few months. I am attracted to bodyweight-based exercises that build strength. I don't really like the gym experience and have always seen lifting weights as a necessary evil.",1180656000,10,2581,4.924137931034482
2529701,5,B000EQH2PG,"This DVD was very easy to watch and understand, the music added synergy. The instructions clear and demonstrations simple. The dialogue very easy to listen to and calming which complements the exercise. The teachers method of instruction is great. The routines were stepped well from easy to more challenging, a fantastic way to strengthen your mind and body.",1174348800,8,359,5.206896551724138
2529702,5,B000EQH2PG,"I would, quite honestly, recommend this to anyone.  Yes, I'm one of those CST people, and no, I'm not brainwashed.  I'm a skeptic by nature.

The exercises are presented in a form that anyone can do them, starting with a ""prop"" for balance and ease, and moving incrementally to the unassisted exercise.  The selection and sequencing of exercises is really quite brilliant - performing them PROPERLY (there is help in doing this, both on the DVD and online) is a very thorough workout.  The rhythm is also calming to the mind once learned.  The moves work the muscles nicely, but in building the sequence it's very clear that much work was put into the balance, flexibility and suppleness that goes along with the muscular work.  Definitely not pure grunt, but rather a wholistic approach to the use and training of all the body's abilities.  (I'm not saying it's the ""ultimate everything,"" just that it's excellent and has very broad applications.)

For someone who isn't ""athletic"" and doesn't want to be, this is still a very good choice, perhaps one of the best.  No equipment except for the ""prop"" used as an assist in the beginning work on the DVD, and a chair would do for this.  You can do it anywhere, you'll see better returns the more you practice, and the gains in health, fitness and energy are pretty much unavoidable by my experience.

Definitely worth a go.",1153785600,20,1372,4.718487394957983
2529703,5,B000EQH2PG,"This product is for anyone, from a complete couch potato to a seasoned athlete.  While I am not a martial artist by any means (I'm a strength athlete), working with this product has increased my endurance, mobility and strength.  The exercise range from the simple to the advanced, and you are encouraged to put them together into Flows.

Be warned, just because a movement is simple doesn't mean it's easy, and just because something isn't easy doesn't mean it's impossible!

I highly recommend this for anyone who want to improve their fitness, or for anyone who thinks they are at the top of their game.",1153785600,8,606,4.742857142857143
2529704,5,B000EQH2PG,"Having used fitness videos before, been a member of various gyms, and a client of a personal trainer, I can attest that the quality of instruction on Flow Fit is some of the best there is. You are your own best ""personal trainer"", and along with the exercises, Coach Sonnon explains how to discover and develop that capability.

I started with this DVD as suggested, just learning the exercises, then began to put them together into ""flows"". I have an active exercise life: Martial arts, cycling, lots of walking and some weight training, but the first few sessions, I lasted maybe 5 minutes at one level above the most basic.

After three months of workouts with Flow Fit about twice a week, I'm good for 20+ minutes at level 3. Soon, I'll advance at least partly up to the next level. The ""bonus"" is that the strength, agility and resilience this program develops translates into and benefits even the most ordinary activities of daily life, from playing with the pets or kids, to loading the dishwasher.",1153785600,14,1006,4.7102272727272725
2529705,5,B000EQH2PG,"If you are a Jiu-Jitsu player, and need a great, powerful, and extremely beneficial warm-up, Sonnon has giving you 7 powerful warm-up and 4 levels for each warm-up. I have stopped my other warm-ups because of the beneficial body flow movements that Scott Sonnon has put together. I have seen only one other person with such powerful body flow movements, that is Rickson Gracie, and he has only shown me two (note: those two are shown in Flow-Fit). Scott Sonnon just may be the next evolution in body flow movement training. O.K. this is for the BJJ players, if you like Ginastica Natual by Alvaro Romano (that is if you can find a copy) then you will love Flow-Fit, because the warn-ups translate into improving your fight game. Good luck and see you on the mat.  James ""Zoo"" Brannum, Jr.",1145836800,8,788,4.628571428571429

2529707,5,B000EQH2PG,"I do martial arts, pilates, yoga, kettlebells. Each one has a different emphasis. I have reasonably good strength and flexibility and am looking for a challenge. Scott Sonnon's Flowfit is the perfect all-in-one package.

Eighteen minutes a day (I do level 4 for all the exercises) gives me all the cardio I need along with joint mobility and flexibility. I have definitely seen an improvement in my range of motion and a reduction in the number of muscle pulls I used  to experience during martial arts training.  If I have to pick just one workout on a particular day, it would be this one. Besides, it's perfect to do in a hotel room or on a beach. No special equipment required.

I don't like the murky background and the audio quality could have been better, but once you memorise the exercises, you don't need the DVD at all.

2529708,5,B000EQH2PG,"Flowfit is by far the best movement modality that I have come encountered thus far. I have an extensive background in the chinese internal martial arts including tai-chi,bagua and hsing-i. I have also studied awareness through movement and Hannana somatics. Flowfit when  gives you an amazing workout even at the beginner level. The scaling on the levels is pure genius. Level one is accessible to anyone and builds a solid platform for the increasing movement sophistication of the subsequent levels. Coach Sonnan's introductory remarks on intuitive training alone are worth the price of the dvd. He is truly a first rate mind.
The instructions for the movements are concise yet comprehensive in the sense that he gives you all the important cues but leaves space for the open-ended explorations of the movements. Some of the earlier reviewers miss this point. When combined with intu-flow you gain access to deep levels of mind/body and vitality that in other practices only come after years of diligent work--if at all. I never would have thought that was possible in 18 minutes, but it is.
Finally, this is the real deal. Whether you want to improve your martial arts, yoga, or any other athletic endeavor this is the practice for you. If you just want to feel better and move better, this is it. If you combine this with intu-flow you are on your to mastery movement in the most time-efficient manner possible..It is fun too!!",1286150400,4,1431,4.913223140495868
2529709,5,B000EQH2PG,"Other reviewers have done a great job laying out Sonnon's basic format, so I'll not repeat their good work.

On the other hand, I humbly disagree with others who criticize the instruction.  I've found this to be the most empowering DVD for fitness, and actually the most powerful and inspiring fitness guidance I've ever encountered.  The results have been awesome.

The key is breaking every element down into the smallest pieces.  This allows you to build control over every aspect of your body work.  This control includes both what you envision as well as what you experience physically.  Sonnon teaches you to understand, monitor and control your body work like no other instructor I know.

Among the results I've found - and I've been working with Sonnon's guidance for about 2 years now - there are:

1. Perhaps the most important is that I can now create exercises for any problem or limit I encounter.
2. I'm able and motivated to exercise every day and do so with greater consistency than ever before in my life.
3. The range of motion for all my limbs and joints has increased by approximately 30 - 40%.
4. Sonnon's guidance leads to wonderful stretching, and I'm likely now 30 - 40% more limber and flexible.
5. I've completely freed up both of my shoulders and healed a deep, lifelong weakness in my left shoulder.
6. Both knees, which have limited me for my entire life, are now pain free and I'm able to run and jump for the first time in decades without leg discomfort or pain.

I could list other results, but you get the idea.  I can't recommend Sonnon's methods as documented in this DVD too strongly.  If you get the DVD and follow the teaching, you'll change your health and fitness for the better, forever.",1260748800,11,1728,4.629508196721312
2529710,5,B000EQH2PG,Very thorough teaching style. Scott breaks every exercise down to it's simplest elements and builds one flow into another seamlessly. I highly recommend this video and exercise as part of anyones training regime.,1257638400,2,212,5.454545454545454
2529711,4,B000EQH2PG,"Using Flowfit allows you to simultaneously work on strength, agility, mobility, and muscular/cardiovascular endurance. In its easiest incarnation, even those who are elderly, extremely out of shape or recovering from an injury can use and benefit. In its most advanced version, it can still provide a challenge to accomplished athletes.

It's convenient in that all you need is 8' by 8' of floor space to practice it, and it only takes 15 minutes or so to get in a complete, beneficial workout.

Everyday non-athletes can use this to ensure that their body is fit enough to get them through their day without tanking so that they can still have fun and enjoy themselves after a hard day's work.

Competitive athletes will find that Flowfit is not enough to get them into competition readiness. But Flowfit excels in helping athletes fill in gaps in their training regimen. For instance, while strength athletes are unlikely to find it challenging from a strength perspective, they can use Flowfit to improve aspects they might have neglected, such as cardiovascular endurance and balance, while endurance athletes will be able to ensure respectable levels of strength throughout their bodies. Perhaps most importantly, Flowfit does wonders for all the joints in one's body. You'll be amazed at what's been neglected in that respect, even if you think of yourself as in good shape.

Use Flowfit as a warmup, a cooldown, as your main regimen, or as merely a recovery workout. Regardless, you'll be glad you tried it, and you'll feel--and perform--better.

My only complaint about this disc is that production quality is not as good as it could be. Video is a bit grainy and badly lit, and Sonnon's excellent instruction and demos would have been better served if multiple camera angles had been used. Nevertheless, it's good enough for anyone to see how he does it and to learn the progression, so this is a minor complaint only.",1233705600,6,1927,4.972049689440993
2529712,4,B000EQH2PG,"The workout is great, almost an ideal stand alone fitness system, but the instruction is not quite as good.

Scott Sonnon is knowledgable and charismatic, and communicates well, but the instruction in this video could be better.  Specifically, if each level of routine had the option of a voice-over so you could execute the routine without looking up so much it would be easy as you start out.  Also, the finer points of form are not always clear, and with the intensity of the higher levels, I'm concerned that a misstep in form could have serious consequences.

FlowFit as a fitness program is outstanding.  Range of motion, cardio, balance, coordination, and muscular strength are all addressed well.  The one gap that jumped out at me was the upper body strength that can be developed with a chin-up bar.  I've only worked up to the third of four levels, and 15 minutes has me smoked.

Overall, it is a good but not perfect video and program.  Good enough that I'm willing to gamble on the second FlowFit video.

2529713,4,B000EQH2PG,"I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that wants to improve their acrobatic capacity. This DVD explains and teaches about four moves:Pressing, Mountain Climber, Kick outs and Squatting. Each move has three levels of difficulty from therapeutic to the full range. He puts some flows together for example so you can get the rhythm and there you have it. It is simple, pithy and leaves you working with a deceptively simple base structure of movement to work on. The second level on DVD two REQUIRES familiarity and practice on the first. It also helps to have his Bodyflow DVD. This I got from the sight in a combo set with some 5 pound clubs.

Frankly, after years of manual labor, dancing regularly, I never drive...so walking and biking everywhere I go....Coach Sonnon has a system of movement training that has few contemporaries. Honestly, I use both Sonnon's C.S.T. methods as well as Coach Pavel Tsatsouline's 'Hard-Style' and Coach Valery Fedorenko's methods. I like all good advice and this was worth the money....because I found it used. If you practice advanced yoga and Pilates' method or have been in BUDs you don't need this, otherwise, especially for Joe and Jane Civilian that wants a workout in their bedroom for a small budget, this is gold. Enjoy.",1193702400,23,1265,4.883720930232558
2529714,4,B000EQH2PG,"Nice video with several challenging flows.  The thing I like about this video is that it provides a very introductory level workout all the way to a very advanced workout.  No matter what level you are, you will sweat your rear end off.  I consider myself in shape and am usually sweating and begging for mercy 10 minutes into the workout.

This video only earns 4 stars from me because I don't feel Sonnon gives enough instruction on form.  Coming from the Yoga world where form is everything, there are many occasions I don't believe I have enough instruction on how to do certain moves.  This becomes important because one of the caveats in moving forward in your flows is having a technique level of 8 or higher.  I just don't feel like I really know what an 8 is since he doesn't give very many technique/form tips...know what I mean?

On a personal note, if you are tall, you will have an extra challenge with this video.  There is a lot of bending at the knees and coming to the ground.  Us tall folks have a lot farther to go and with our center of gravity being higher it can be more challenging.  Mr. Sonnon looks like he stands about 5'8 so I have trouble keeping up with him when I follow along on the flows.",1188000000,7,1220,4.330396475770925
2529715,5,B000EQH2PG,"The Flowfit DVD warrants two 5-Star ratings. The first for the actual DVD. The quality of production and teaching is excellent. I remember when I first opened up the package and put it in the DVD player, I was able to learn quickly with understanding the program that Scott Sonnon has created. His introduction of how to use the program helps any student to progress through the four levels of the kinetically-chained seven exercises or ""movements"" that make up Flowfit.
My second 5-Stars goes the program itself. I am doing Flowfit three times a week as proscribed in the DVD for the necessary 15 or so minutes. I can not overstate the benefits I have obtained by doing Flowfit; physically, mentally and even emotionally. The exercises that Sonnon has developed throughly works your body in what he calls the Six Degrees of Freedom. My martial arts has improved remarkable and the I haven't felt more limber and agile in many years and I am 49.
The great thing about Flowfit is that you don't really need any equipment or expensive gym membership. Moving your own body weight gracefully in all its possible dimensions and directions (The Six Degrees of Freedom) has a remarkable synergistic effect. I truly see and 'feel' the results of this great program. Scott Sonnon is the founder of a organization and forum, RMAXinternational that proscribes to a physical fitness culture that is health-first oriented as opposed to physique-first which most physical fitness systems stress. Flowfit will definitely improve your overall health, but yes, you're physique (and agility and flexibility) will improve, too.
I also do Flowfit when I'm in a funk, have had a bad day, need a warm up for other physical activity like my martial arts class, or a form of moving meditation. It's a wisely chosen name, Flowfit: Getting 'fit' through 'flow'.",1185753600,8,1835,4.941747572815534
8113329,3,B000EQH2PG,"I picked this up used and I think it is OK. If I paid 40.00 for it, I would not be happy. I did find something of value in it that I really like, but most of it was useless for me.

To start out, I'm in pretty good shape. I've done yoga for years -- and even picked up a teaching certification at one point -- and I have worked out enough to drop my body fat to the point of seeing visible abs. With that in mind, before you purchase this, I'm going to throw a few things out that may be deal breakers for this video. If you can't doing ""rolling"" squats or pistol squats, you may not enjoy these FlowFit routines. To see what rolling squats are, google ""5XcJ4KS2hhI"" and look at this short clip.

I would love to be able to do rolling squats. There is something about my body type though that makes them really hard. I also can't do pistol squats.  Almost all the Flows above level 1 start throwing in rolling squats and some variations of really low squats that look similar to a modified pistol squat. I'm not sure if I can ever do these two things no matter how much I practiced. And this is being in good shape. If you aren't in good shape or are overweight, have knee problems, etc., these two moves are much, much harder.

As it is, I really liked Level 1, because it uses a prop that lets me do an easier version of the pistol squat variation, and there are also no rolling squats in Level 1. The rest of Flows, there is so much I can't do that I don't really care to even try.

So all in all, for what it is, I found something I like in the DVD and I plan on using from here on out. If I had paid the full price for this DVD, I would not be happy. I'm not sure how anyone thinks that price is justified when there are so many quality fitness DVDs with way more content on them for way less money. Seriously, I have purchased 10-DVD programs for half the price of this one DVD. And one DVD that basically amounts to a DVD with a handful of short clips on it, at that.",1494633600,,1974,4.0

8113331,4,B000EQH2PG,"I personally like Flowfit and I have already had positive results from it. Following are what I consider pros and cons.

Pros:
- Effective
 -Accessible to total beginners and still challenging to athletes. Scott put a lot of work into making sure the even if you have strength or mobility limitations the user can begin using flowfit.
-There is no up-selling. You aren't expected to buy a bunch of extras supplements or anything. You may need a stool and of course a good surface to train on, but the lack of high pressure sales is refreshing to me.
-Time. Performing the flows shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes 3 times a week.

Cons:
-Adequate, but production quality of videos could be a lot better.
-Lack of supplemental information and documentation. The user will likely have a question and apart from watching the videos there is no official ""go to"" source that I have found to answer questions. I have found outside information on the web, but some of the sources are contradictory.
-A bit monotonous. Its a series of challenging movements repeated. I guess I have a short attention span.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and its exactly what I've been looking for. The lack of slick packaging doesn't detract from my feeling that this is a worthwhile program.",1486080000,,1278,4.769230769230769

8113334,4,B000EQH2PG,"I received this as a gift (albeit requested via wishlist) and while I'm still in the process of learning the exercises, so far I've found the material beneficial. I was surprised that by doing just the first two exercises at the second level of difficulty, after 5 minutes my heart rate was up.  Based on that limited experience, I anticipate that 15 minutes of all 7 exercises at level 4 will be a good workout.  In other words, the combined exercises are more challenging than they appear from simply watching the video demonstration.

From a content perspective, the explanations of the exercises are clear.  It's helpful to have a progression from easy to more challenging.

From a technical perspective, the production quality of the video and DVD is adequate but not great. The video is shadowed and many scenes are zoomed in too close, obscuring Sonnon's feet and top of his head as he's demonstrating.  My biggest challenge was with accessing all the chapters on the DVD.  I played it in my Win 7 laptop and found that the DVD's menu navigation doesn't work in Windows Media Player.  Clicking on ""Back"" and ""Next"" has no effect.  Once I click into the ""Exercises"" sub-menu, I only see the chapters for the first 4 exercises.  So, I used handbrake.fr (open source video transcoder) to convert the DVD chapters into individual video files which I could watch.

The video consists primarily of verbal explanations of the exercises and principles, etc, which is fine, but has very minimal footage of the actual exercises. This is absolutely NOT intended to be a workout program that you can pop in and follow along with in real time, like most other home fitness videos. It is nice that there are various levels for the exercises, but even the most difficult level would be just a warmup or mobility drill for a conditioned person. Again, the main frustration for me was that I could not really work on the exercises as the video was playing, because it is difficult to see from the floor (poor background lighting), and there are no verbal cues to follow along to. And again, the actual ""workout"" portion was merely a handful of basic exercises with no clear parameters (sets, reps, time, ect). I have attempted other videos by Scott Sonnon and had the same frustrations.
