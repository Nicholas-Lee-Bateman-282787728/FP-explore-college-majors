7800819,2,1880336391,"Taekwondo Master Lynette Love undoubtedly knows her technique and has astounding experience in the Olympics and elsewhere, but her ""Perfect Your Taekwondo Kicking"" video falls short of its potential.
As a member of a novice TKD family, my critique centers on two fronts: a) the video's production values; and b) Master Love's TKD style and demeanor.
On the production side, busy mirrored backdrops and background noise distract from the video. Integrating varied camera angles with each kick technique (rather than grouping the angles) would better illustrate the kicks and educate the viewer.
Lynette Love has great strength and apparent size, but it was her sparring partners who demonstrated more energetic techniques- mostly because they are so much smaller and lighter than Master Love is. Her partners really had to show great athleticism to reach and phase Lynette Love. Master Love kicks impressively, but she doesn't work at it- she's so tall a lackluster kick still strikes high and with power on her opponent. Unfortunately, that lackluster demeanor is even more apparent on her painfully scripted ""talking head"" interviews.
So overall, from a novice perspective, ""Perfect Your Taekwondo Kicking"" does provide valuable and clear kicking demonstrations. Master Lynette Love is a good female role model for novice TKD enthusiasts. However, the video's production shortcomings and lack of energy diminish its educational and entertainment value.",986860800,3,1453,5.520179372197309
