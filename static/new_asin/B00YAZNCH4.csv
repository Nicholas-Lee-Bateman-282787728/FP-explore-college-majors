8718032,3,B00YAZNCH4,This was ok the story was good the part i did not like was the audio would peak with the screaming. I get it its a low budget film so Im not going to say any more than that. But the special features are great to watch. I understood it a little better with the cast commentary. I always enjoy listening to that after i see a move and hearing all the stories about the scenes. And when they point out flaws or what should have happened. Over all this will not win anything special its a fun watch. And some of the actors went on to be in bigger and better films,1473120000,,559,3.9557522123893807
8718033,3,B00YAZNCH4,"I essentially agree with lauras review...signature scenes from TCM, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT work pretty well, but I just didn't feel the suspense I felt from those movies...the actors try hard, but they can't rise to the level of Gunnar Hansen, Sarah Butler, or David Hess, so I cant give them the same 5-star status that I give those three horror icons...

good movie--3 stars from me...

buttcrack voyeurs will enjoy brookes chase scene through the woods im sure...",1454630400,,492,4.709302325581396
8718034,5,B00YAZNCH4,"Loved the movie. Scary, funny, sexy, and some bad ass lines that your sure to want to quote after the movie. There's some parts that will make you cringe but what's a horror movie with out a few parts that makes you want to look away? yet you keep watching because you don't want to miss anything.",1447977600,3,297,4.228070175438597
