2877287,5,B000RZIGYA,"Both the name of the performance troupe and the name of the organization they portrayed, Upright Citizens Brigade (or UCB) was a show that ran for three short seasons on Comedy Central.

Sketch comedy and guerilla street theater were the sword and with them, the UCB skewered modern life with thematically linked episodes and season-long running story lines. Featuring Amy Poehler, Matt Besser, Matt Walsh and Ian Roberts as the UCB (and many other characters!) and a slew of comedians and actors like Rob Cordry of the Daily Show (many of whom got their start working with the UCB).

Springing forth from long-running live shows, the UCB were a shadowy anarchist organization, fighting every day to break the tyranny of a civilization seemingly designed to drive people insane. That civilization? None other than our own. This world was also home to many memorable recurring characters, all brought to life by the expert members of the UCB troupe.

The second season continued and built-upon a strong first season. The first season, while great, was mainly made up of sketches and story lines the UCB had been performing or working on for years, although perfected and sometimes expanded for television. The second season was conversely new material, specifically written for the show, or developed from their concurrent and weekly live improv show in New York. This meant a greater cohesion in the threaded stories of the sometimes diverse sketches contained in an episode. Some topics covered in this season: the (at the time) trend of bastardizing Asian culture, the American Drug War, religion, theme restaurants and even the weather.

Though cruelly canceled by a heartless and terrible corporation, the UCB as a group continues to perform and teach improv comedy at their theaters in NYC and LA.",1192752000,2,1802,5.098305084745762
2877288,2,B000RZIGYA,"I was a little disappointed that one of the DVDs had something on the bottom that made it impossible for me to watch several episodes, as well as many of the commentaries on that disc.",1192060800,2,184,4.285714285714286
2877289,5,B000RZIGYA,"If you have any love for sketch comedy or improv, or the intersection thereof, you'll love this series.  Season 3 cannot come fast enough.",1190592000,3,138,4.75
2877290,5,B000RZIGYA,"If you haven't seen The Upright Citizens Brigade yet you should. The comedy is usually centered around a ""straight man"" becoming increasingly infuriated or insane as he/she is worked on by the UCB's ""cyborgs."" (characters that the UCB agents us to spread chaos) The comedy style of the troupe is very unique. They mention pop-culture but they aren't completely centered on it. They sometimes use accents and wacky costumes, but they definitely don't rely on them to be funny. Fans of absurdist comedy will love these guys! I recommend that you buy Season One first, however, as the UCB is fond of bringing up references from previous sketches.",1190073600,4,643,4.962962962962963
2877291,5,B000RZIGYA,"I love these guys, but I think they release their DVD's to coincide with Presidential elections. See you in 2012 for season 3.",1188432000,,126,4.521739130434782
2877292,5,B000RZIGYA,"I've been checking Amazon and Comedy Central for years now waiting for this...  and Finally!!!!!!!!!!
One of the greatest comedy series ever!!!!!!!!!!
I will be first in line for it.",1188086400,,182,5.066666666666666
2877293,5,B000RZIGYA,"I have cursed comedy central so many times for not releasing the second and third seasons of UCB right after the first one, but I guess I partially retract some of my previous statements. But I will only forgive comedy central in full, when the the third season comes out and they put that fake debate show ""Crossballs"" on DVD (probably comedy central best show in recent past.) God forbid they come out with a good show on dvd, instead shove mind of mencia down our throats. I still have not talked to a single person that doesn't hate Carlos Mencia, but I guess I don't know that many mexicans.",1186963200,9,596,4.427272727272728
2877294,5,B000RZIGYA,"it's about f#*!ing time!  please do not keep us waiting so long for season 3, comedy central.... this was the best, most under-rated sketch comedy show ever:)",1184198400,11,158,4.851851851851852
2877295,5,B000RZIGYA,"It has been a long time coming, but it looks like we UCB fans finally win out, and get the next season.  Who else has had the first season for years, hoping and praying that the good folks at Comedy Central would release from bondage the now practically ""lost episodes""?  The UCB is the closest thing the U.S. has to a pure sketch comedy group, and UCB is up there in brilliance with the Kids In The Hall, and dare I say it, possibly even Monty Python.  High praise I know, but the Brigade deserve it.  I can't wait for the release.  Intelligent comedy and satire up there with the best.",1183075200,33,587,4.252252252252252
2877296,4,B000RZIGYA,"When this show first started, I absolutely loved it and was sad when the series ended. Years later I remembered that this show existed and was super excited that I was able to find both seasons on dvd. I watched them right away but was disappointed to discover that my memory of the series was funnier than the actuality. As far a random comedy skits go, this is pretty darn funny but if you're not familiar with the show, you may not enjoy it.",1432684800,,444,4.2976190476190474
2877297,3,B000RZIGYA,"Once again, this is sketch comedy that borders on the ridiculous.  But, it's pretty funny at times other times kinda dumb, but they take chances and stretch comedy to it's borders.  I love Amy Poelher, she is so good.  It's always interesting.",1427328000,,243,4.738095238095238
2877298,1,B000RZIGYA,"THE FIRST ONE WAS FUNNY, THIS ONES ALL ABOUT NASTY SEXUAL REFENCES AND CRAZY STUFF, I DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL. VERY CHEESY TOO. I WOULD ONLY GET THE FIRST SEASON.",1424736000,,159,4.161290322580645
2877299,5,B000RZIGYA,"Great show, hillarious!  I'm glad I thought to seek it out.  Wasn't disappointed!",1422576000,,81,5.153846153846154
2877300,3,B000RZIGYA,"Great show, with some classic episodes in this season. Some decent special features and commentary.

But the video quality is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure how they managed to churn something out like this. Season 3 is out on Amazon DVD-R on demand and even that looks much, much better than this season.

Edit: It's actually interesting. It's not simply over-compression from trying to squeeze bonus material on the discs or anything. There are clips here and there (including all the intros) which have no grain at all. Rather, it seems to be a problem with the transfer from the master tapes. Or, perhaps the masters themselves weren't even available.

For instance, in episode 3, there are some scenes at the UCB headquarters, toward the end, that look fine. But other scenes in that episode are, without exaggeration, some of the worst mastering I've ever seen on a DVD. Does anyone have more information on what might have happened with this release?",1418515200,,960,4.91358024691358

2877314,5,B000RZIGYA,"I was thrilled to find two seasons of UCB on DVD.  Yes, season one is better than two, but they both have priceless moments.  I'm only writing this review to demand season three!  Where is season three???  Why do you treat fans like this, Comedy Central?",1285113600,5,254,4.456521739130435

2877317,5,B000RZIGYA,ucb has got to be the funniest sketch comedy i've ever seen and this second season is even better than the first. a definite buy if you're a ucb fan or if you're just looking for a new video to make you laugh - but you have to like random comedy! these guys are truly talented!,1239580800,2,277,3.9642857142857144
2877318,4,B000RZIGYA,"Upright Citizens Brigade is just one of those shows that never got as popular as it should have been and could have been. It deserved release on dvd --which took forever. Years. I don't even know how many. Several.

This season 2 collection is good, but season 3 is better. But where is it? Can somebody please tell me why it takes years to release this show on dvd????? Will season 3 ever come out?",1238803200,,399,4.32
2877319,5,B000RZIGYA,"I love this show, In my opinion it never really got the attention it deserved. The show is absolutely hilarious as is everything else they do.",1237420800,,142,4.5

2877321,5,B000RZIGYA,"Much like the first season, well, exactly like the first season, but with all new sketches, the Upright Citizens Brigade comes with in your face comedy. Sketches to gross you out and offend you at the same time. Sketches to make you laugh and some to make you think.  They even carry some characters over from the first season. You will not be disappointed.",1211846400,,357,4.578125
2877322,4,B000RZIGYA,"If you're not familiar with the Upright Citizens Brigade, they were a skit comedy group that wove their sketches together (much like Monty Python and Mr. Show, though not as good) creating a full circle to the lives of their characters.  The overall premise of the show was that the four characters you see on the front cover were a secret organization located at the center of the earth who sought new ways to bring chaos to the people of the world by any means possible.  I recommend the 1st season much more than this one.
If you are familiar with the UCB, just buy it already!  Let's hope the 3rd season comes out in the next decade.  Oh, by the way, the following skits are NOT on this 2nd season collection: 'Werewolf sex', 'Vibrating boot', 'Pro Thunderball', and the episode in which a man is being held captive in a basement though he is unaware that he is actually hooked up to a virtual reality machine.",1197590400,2,914,4.455089820359281
2877323,5,B000RZIGYA,"Anybody who enjoys sketch comedy will absolutely love Upright
Citizens Brigade. The seasons get better as they go but where is Season 3? I have been waiting for a couple years now for it to come out, and I am beside myself that Comedy Central likes to make this show an afterthought. Stop wating your time producing piles of poop like ""Ugly Americans"", ""Halfway House"", and anything that has Carlos Mencia (AKA Ned Yolnist) and do us real comedy fans a favor. Just release the 3rd season of UCB already and you'll have us crazy fans of your case. Not to mention UCB itself, who is not shy about their feelings for Comedy Central in their commentaries.",1194220800,,651,4.572649572649572
2877324,5,B000RZIGYA,"UCB was an amazing show that was way ahead of its time.  The episodes in this collection are amazing, but the special features are even cooler.  There are some awesome UCB performances from Comedy Central shows that I've never seen before.  There are also some hilarious commentary tracks.

THIS IS A MUST BUY.",1193616000,2,310,4.7924528301886795
2877325,4,B000RZIGYA,"Finally they've released the second season of one of the funniest shows ever.  I can't wait till season 3 comes out.  The commentary is pretty good.  They've recorded commentary for every episode, unlike the first season, which is a plus.  It can drag at times when they decide to impersonate certain characters (the Tite brothers) but also has many gems (""Bong Boy!  Are you really here?"").  If you've never seen it, I would sugest starting with season one, but this is a MUST own for any fan.  Special guests include: Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, Rob Corddry, Wu-Tang Clan and David Cross.",1192838400,2,586,4.742574257425742
