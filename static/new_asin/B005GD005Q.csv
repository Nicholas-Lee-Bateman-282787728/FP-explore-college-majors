4690035,5,B005GD005Q,"What's In the Bible? is a series created by Phil Vischer (widely known as the creator of Veggie Tales), but this is no simple spin-off from Veggie Tales.  In the video that I post below you may begin to get some idea that there is more to this video than you would expect.  Fun, cute, entertaining, but also educational.  That's a pretty big bill to fill, and Phil Vischer does it.

We sat down to watch this as a family.  I wanted to have the response of everyone in my house age 34 down to age 3.  The videos (there are 2 segments on this DVD) are fast-paced and cover a lot of ground in the Old Testament (this video covers Joshua, Judges, and Ruth). This meant that there was never a dull moment.  Some of the information moves so quickly that the younger kids can not possibly pick it all up (especially the 3 yo), but they certainly are absorbing some of it.  And since we own the DVD, that means we can watch it again in the future.  Repetition will encourage memorization, and the songs and characters help tremendously.  The fast pace lends itself well to the intended age group (elementary students), but also held the attention of my tween, teen, and us adults.  The characters in the video tackle questions such as ""Did God want people to die?"" (referring to God's command to the Israelites to kill all of the people living in the land of Canaan) without shying away.  This carries the material of the DVD beyond well-known Bible stories and into issues requiring deeper thought.  Also keeping the material moving at a fast pace allows kids to get a good overview of the entire Bible.  Frequent reminders are given to how each story in the Bible points to God's plan to redeem His people through His Son, Jesus Christ.  Excellent for the whole family!

I asked Caleb, my 9 year old, to write his own review of this DVD.  Here is his response:

What did you learn from this video?
I learned how the Israelites got into the promised land.  I learned that the Promised Land was named Canaan.  I also learned that there was only one woman judge and Samson was the last judge.  I learned that Ruth is related to King David and King David is one of the great-great-great----grandfathers of Jesus.  So the family line goes all the way down to Jesus.

Is it entertaining?
Yes, very entertaining.  Especially when the pirate starts popping up in the hot air balloon and singing away.  And the theme song is pretty silly (in a good way).

Would you watch the rest of the series?
Yeah.  I would love to watch more.

Who is your favorite character?
 I don't know, probably the pirate.

We can't wait to watch it again.  I do recommend only watching one segment at a time.  Sitting down for the entire hour (like we did the first time) is going to be way too much information for everyone to digest.  This would be great for family devotions, home Bible study, or to supplement homeschooling!",1287446400,,2891,4.466539196940727
4690036,4,B005GD005Q,"Tyndale gave me the opportunity to review a new kid's DVD as long as I could coax some children to watch it with me. I tried convincing my 10-year old son to watch it with me, but he wasn't very excited when he heard it was from the same creator of Veggie Tales. It isn't that he doesn't like Bob and Larry, but I don't think he appreciates that I've memorized many of Larry's Silly Songs and like to perform them on occasion in our family van.

Thankfully I have some friendly, animated kids in my neighborhood who are a little younger and a little less jaded about my singing. They agreed to watch the video and help me with my ""homework."" After a meal of toasted cheese sandwiches and tomato soup we sat down with their mom to watch what Phil Vischer has been creating other than animated vegetables.

The What's in the Bible series is a set of 13, hour long DVD's using children friendly storytelling to teach young audiences about the content of the Bible. We watched #4, Battle for the Promised Land that covers the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. Unlike the VeggieTales animated series, What's In the Bible's characters are based on puppetry- some of it as simple as static characters fastened on popsicle sticks. What makes the viewer's imagination come alive is the creative writing and songs.  Vischer uses a vast array of characters (besides himself) to walk through the Bible: a newsroom host, a cowboy, a southern black preacher, a Scottish pirate, two British explorers, a piano playing priest, a Swedish scientist, a Sunday school teacher, and two uptight church ladies who give commentary like the Muppets' Statler and Waldorf. The story is shared almost too rapidly by bouncing between multiple characters, scenes, and songs. I'm sure that watching the video more than once, along with the others in the series, would help the viewer get used to the characters and the rapid fire exchanges. Vischer uses pop culture references that the kids will recognize (In this DVD he mentions the cartoons, Blues Clues, Sponge Bob, and Donald Trump.) and he isn't afraid to use bathroom humor to get a few laughs (underwear references and pirates that have to potty).

Did the kids like it? You bet. Their toes tapped, their lips synched with the songs, and they were able to mirror back the summaries of each of the books of the Bible covered in the DVD. My 6 and 9 year old friends even learned big words like ""historical"" (which they remembered because it was ""hysterical"") and ""apostasy"" (even though James remembered it as ""apostrophe""). Arabella liked one of the colorful church ladies and the Sunday school teacher. She enjoyed the songs, but would have liked to have seen more ""action."" James thought the Scottish pirate in the hot air balloon was the best and he ""loved"" the opening song. Both wanted to see more of the videos and hoped that Tyndale might send me some more.

Did the parents like it? Yes and no. If you are interested in going through the scripture with your young kids, the What's In the Bible? series is a fun way to get the conversation going--and there are some really good conversations to have. Vischer doesn't dodge some interesting and tough questions in the book of Joshua. He provides a scientific reason of how the Israelites crossed the Jordan River on dry ground (which will garner various reactions, I'm sure), and he even gets into the theology of why it was okay for the Israelites to claim the land and kick out the current inhabitants. Truthfully I didn't agree with all of the theology points on this video, or even the summary points of the books; but then I don't depend upon kids videos to teach my children; however they can be a fun way to open up the conversation for age and heart-appropriate conversations.

Final score? I'll give this video, and this concept of this series a 4 out of 5. It feels a bit more grown up in content and purpose than VeggieTales, but it's missing some of the magic and childhood innocence as well.",1286755200,,3987,4.664295874822191

It takes very complex theological concepts and simplifies them (for both kids and adults). My kids are a bit on the young side for the target audience (5 y/o twins and 3 y/o) but they are captivated by it. (We overheard our 3 year old was talking about the Septuagint the other day...in an appropriate context!). My husband is a Hebrew scholar and we met in seminary but there are things in this series that we didn't know--we are learning too!

4690054,4,B005GD005Q,"Phil Vischer is attempting to provide kids, their parents, and anyone willing to learn with an overview of the themes of the Bible in a thirteen volume series.  After the first three entries, we've made it through the first five books of the Bible.  It's time to start kicking it into high gear, and that's just what happens with What's in the Bible? Volume 4: Battle for the Promised Land!

Phil is best known for creating the popular VeggieTales series, but instead of computer animation, this time he's using giant puppets and even stepping in front of the camera himself to handle some of the tricky bits and more serious moments.  But the show is still filled with humor and entertainment.  It's hosted by a newscaster and got a Sunday school teacher, two ladies watching and commenting occasionally, and a pirate.

This video boldly takes us into the second major section of the Old Testament, the histories (although some of the characters incorrectly guess that this next section is housewares).  As always, there are two half hour episodes, although I just use the watch all feature on the DVD and watch them both back to back.

The first section covers Joshua.  It talks about the conquest of Israel and whether or not God was justified in taking the land from those who live there and giving it to the Israelites.  The second half hour covers Judges and Ruth.  While we get a brief retelling of Ruth, we don't get any of the stories from Judges.  The emphasis in this section is on the cycle of the Israelites turning from God and worshipping idols, God judging them, the Israelites repenting, and God raising up someone to rescue them.

So far with this series, I've been blown away by how Phil is able to give us so much great information while keeping the jokes flowing.  This time, I felt the information was a little lacking.  Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of great stuff in here, but I didn't feel I learned anything new.  I'm not ashamed to admit I've learned from the previous entries, so that was a bit disappointing to me.  And the recaps they do at the beginning of each episode are getting a little too familiar, especially if you watch both episodes back to back like I do.

The songs in these videos have been hit or miss, so I'm disappointed to say that this video features lots more songs.  See Pirate Pete wants a bigger part in this episode, so he floats over everyone in a hot air balloon breaking into songs about what we're learning.  And, some of them are good and some aren't.  Furthermore, for the second half hour, Pete decides he needs to use the bathroom, but no one knows how to get him down from the hot air balloon.  Never having been a fan of bathroom humor, I didn't care for this section at all.

But I do have to mention the song from the Bentley Brothers.  These two real people come out and sing about the book of Judges.  This is the only time we get anything close to the stories from the book as we see pictures of the men and woman as their names are sung.  If you know the book well, there's enough to remind you about most of them.  It's a catchy song and a good way to jog memories of Deborah, Gideon, and Samson without taking time to tell the stories.

Battle for the Promised Land! is still a good video.  It will entertain kids and show them how Joshua, Judges, and Ruth fit into the larger story of God's plan of salvation.  I think my expectations were too high going into it.",1429660800,2,3441,4.4504792332268375

4690058,5,B005GD005Q,"I didn't actually get bitten by a snake. Because they usually bite your ankles, and Im a puppet; got no ankles. Thats Clive, older brother of Ian at the start of the Bonus Features.

He is one of more than 12 characters who are in this series.

All 13 DVDs include Show Outtakes (puppet bloopers) and Michaels Deleted Scene, and this DVD has an extra bonus, Quackys Questions: What is Love?

This short animated story tells about a little duck who goes back in time and meets Paul in 62 A.D., in prison. In Volume 1, In the Beginning, Quacky met Catherine of Siena. Maybe she didn't really chew chewing gum. And maybe Paul and Quacky didn't really play paddleball but  we do learn something about love from Paul in the fourth DVD, just as we learned something about kindness in the first DVD.

There is no division in this series between Catholic and Protestants. It is a series that covers the bases well, and it includes everyone.

The books of Joshua, Judges and Ruth are covered in about an hour on this Whats in the Bible? Volume 4: Battle for the Promised Land DVD.

It covers tough questions about why there is so much killing in the Bible, and answers why the book of Ruth is in the Bible. With a great song by the Bentley Brothers, a wonderful telling of Ruths story by Chester Whiggets popsicle puppets, and maybe the best depiction ever created of the cycle of apostasy this is an excellent DVD.

Great teaching, colorful cartoons, and humor are sprinkled throughout.

And you won't get bitten by a snake.",1418342400,,1516,4.523809523809524

4690075,5,B005GD005Q,"Our kids were big Veggietales fans, so we thought we'd check out this new series by VT creator, Phil Vischer. We were not disappointed. These videos inspired a great love for scripture in the hearts of our two young children (8-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl). They have also opened up so much wonderful discussion about spiritual things and biblical stories in general.

Our children are extremely sophisticated in their entertainment choices (a result of my own involvement in the entertainment industry). They have an extensive collection of all the latest and greatest Hollywood hits to choose from (we have literally hundreds and hundreds of blu-rays/dvds/3d blu-rays, etc. in our home). Nevertheless, they consistently choose to watch the ""What's In The Bible"" videos over others in our library because they enjoy them so much. I say this to allay any potential concern a person may have that these videos use puppets and not computer-animated characters. Trust me when I tell you that these are not at all cheesy, and in fact are extremely entertaining. (Think Muppets.)

Our kids do not have a strong church attendance background. We get there when we can (a few times a year). But, unfortunately, our schedules do not allow for regular attendance. Thus, we deeply appreciate product offerings such as what Phil Vischer has created here because of the strong biblical foundation it helps us instill in our children. And, it is working wonders. They are regularly sharing scriptural wisdom and making connections on how to apply it to their lives.

We cannot speak highly enough of this series. It accomplishes everything we would hope as parents that it would, in terms of opening up discussion as well as our children's very hearts to the concepts of love toward your neighbor, personal responsibility, and much more. And, it gives them a very safe and surprisingly thorough overview of scripture in an entirely engaging way. In fact, our kids are literally counting the days until the next volume is released! :-)

Purchase them all, without hesitation, and enjoy!",1356134400,2,2076,5.0791788856304985

(I will also note that we are not currently in a church setting, so this has been their sole source of inspiration in this area - besides dad and mom, of course.)  It really warms our hearts to see our children so enthralled with the Bible and so eager to learn more.

4690079,5,B005GD005Q,"The wonderful people at Tyndale House Publishing graciously gave me a copy of the DVD What's in the Bible? Battle for the Promised Land for free in exchange for my honest review.

I was very excited to watch this DVD with my boys.  I am all about exposing them to God as much as possible and I look for opportunities to teach them biblical principles as much as I can, so when I was presented with this offer I just had to take part!

What's in the Bible? Battle for the Promised Land is the fourth installment of a new series by Phil Vischer, co-creator of Veggie Tales!  My kids all loved Veggie Tales and still enjoy singing their songs.

We have not seen the previous 3 DVDs so I did not know what exactly to expect.  Coming in to this series with no prior knowledge I was surprised at how humorous it is.  The characters are appealing to both children and adults and have a Jim Henson quality to them.  Music and jokes are splattered throughout the teachings presented.  Phil himself narrates and teaches lessons with the help of a blue haired lady, The Sunday School Teacher, Pirate Pete and Buck Denver among others.  Songs are sung, and the Bible is explained in a way that both children and adults can understand.

I really enjoyed this DVD and believe that watching these together as a family would not only help parents answer questions about God and the Bible to their children, it would also help open doors to topics parents have a difficult time discussing and would help families draw closer to God and to each other.  I highly anticipate purchasing the prior 3 additions and adding them to our DVD collection.

My oldest son, Joshua also wanted to add his opinion about the DVD.

"" I learned that each book has a special section it belongs to in the Bible.  I found the DVD very entertaining.  I would love to watch the rest of the series.  My favorite character in the show is Pirate Pete.""",1290902400,3,1908,4.452449567723343
4690080,4,B005GD005Q,"Phil Vischer, the creator of the VeggieTales phenomenon, has been busy developing some fun and catchy videos and tunes with the brand new, ""What's in the Bible?"" DVD series.

  This new video series has one main purpose:  introduce children to the Old Testament and tie all of the main stories together with biblical history and maps to make it more real to children.

  I would describe the ""What's In the Bible?"" series as a combination of Vacation Bible School lessons and Sesame Street.  The tunes are fun and catchy; the cartoons, animations, and puppetry are silly and entertaining.

  While this method of teaching children about the Bible may not be my favorite, it is definitely popular with children.  Children laugh, giggle, listen intently, and sing along when they are presented with material in this type of format.

  My main concern is that presenting the Holy Scriptures in this format is possibly making the Bible less believable and ""real.""  However, if the ""What's In the Bible?"" series is presented alongside a parent's guidance and in-depth Bible teaching over many years, then I don't think that viewing these DVDs will do any harm.  The concern is when parents rely on DVDs and material like this and don't put their hearts into molding, guiding, and shaping their children's faith with anything more than ""Sesame Street"" formats of Christianity, which will be blasted almost immediately at almost all public and private and even some ""Christian"" colleges and universities once our children are 18 and older.

  And specifically about the What's In the Bible? series, the content rushes by in each DVD that I've viewed so that it could be overwhelming to some children.  Of course, with numerous viewings of the DVD, I know that children would begin to get the hang of what concepts are being taught.

  Especially if moms and dads aren't used to doing family Bible and worship time together each evening, the ""What's in the Bible?"" DVD series can be used to jumpstart a family's faith-building program at home.  A basic and general overview of the Old Testament is provided with these DVDs, and each one covers at least several books of the Old Testament.  ""What's In the Bible?  Battle for the Promised Land"" covers the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth.

  Catchy, fun, goofy, and silly, yet with a biblical message.  I think that most Christian families will enjoy the What's In the Bible DVD series, although I would recommend using this as a small percentage of your family worship/Bible times together.  Have fun - but continue to guide and direct and teach as one of your primary focuses as a Christian parent!

  What did my girls think of What's In the Bible? Battle for the Promised Land (vol. 4)?

  K:  These are fun DVDs to watch, and they are pretty goofy.  I like them, but I also like watching more realistic and historical versions and reenactments of biblical history.  There wasn't anything new on this DVD that we haven't learned together as a family.

  B:  I love watching these, although there are a couple of things (a character, a song) that drive me batty because they are just weird!  I'd like to watch the rest of the series for fun.

Bet you don't know this guy.  He resembles Steve Jobs but with shorter sleeves.  And, he is known for working with computers - in a way.  I'll give you a hint...  He seems to like food.  I mean REALLY like food...  like... broccoli...  or celery...  cauliflower...  lima beans...  And jelly.  JELLY?  I bet before the Jelly you would have sworn this to be Phil Vischer, that culinary genius, that edible artist that brought us a certain Cucumber who pined for manatees with a Tomato as his best friend, Pirates who Don't Do Anything and that song that makes all run out and light our grills - His Cheeseburger (aka The Cheeseburger Song).
Well, you would have been right.  This is the uber-genius of cartoon crazy.  The one and only Veggie Tales founder.  Yes this is Mr. Vischer.  The man.  (I probably Do love Veggie Tales more than my kids.)
""So,"" you ask.  ""What does jelly have to do with it?""  Jelly News with Buck Denver, that's what.  Denver is the friendly news anchor and co-host with Vischer in his newest creation, What's in the Bible, a 13 DVD series that summarizes each of the books of the Bible in a kid friendly manner that is even entertaining for the adults who are sure to have them memorized before the DVD's wear out.
Volume 4,  Battle for the Promised Land!, begins in the book of Joshua and takes the viewer through Judges and to the book of Ruth.  By the time my children were done watching this episode they were naming the Israel's judges (which they learned from the catchy Jack Johnsonesque tune by the Fabulous Bentley Brothers) and understood the meaning of the book of Ruth and even the concept of apostacy.
 I asked my seven year old boy to write a little review of the video himself and this is what he had to say:
""I liked ""What's in the Bible.'  The Bentley Brothers are funny.  I really liked the Sunday School Lady.  She was just funny.  I learned that being nice to your enemy will make them be nicer.  I want to see the rest of the series.  I want to see the whole thing and see what God does at Revelation.""
I was pleased at how well the children (as well as their parents) enjoyed the DVD.  It was filled with information and gave great opportunity to further learn about what God had in mind for that period in history.  I was especially pleased at how Vischer handled the tough questions that will obviously be voiced by adults and children alike when a subject as strong as war are covered.
This collection is sure to be a constant in our DVD players and will be an excellent tool to open up a discussion with our children in our study in the Bible.

4690083,4,B005GD005Q,"From VeggieTales creator Phil Vischer comes the fourth volume in the What's in the Bible? series of DVDs from Tyndale Kids, ""Battle for the Promised Land"". Each volume presents different segments of the Bible, making the history and wisdom within God's word easier to understand for children and their families.

While Phil's VeggieTales (VT) relied primarily on animation to share their stories and lessons, What's in the Bible? uses several mediums in which to engage children.  There is some animation, but there are also live actors, and most prominently, hand puppets.  There is more of a variety show feel than one individualized story.  VT fans will recognize many of the voices and accents from years before, and they are once again very funny and entertaining.

I must admit, when first exposed to this series, I was very skeptical about the use of hand puppets.  I just didn't think they could be as witty as VT.  But like the other volumes in this series, Battle for the Promised Land pulls it off.  While they're dealing with important spiritual lessons, they're still alot of fun and bring plenty of laughs.  There are several in-jokes that some may miss, but adults and VT fans will catch them. My personal favorite is a wall clock with a unique time zone location.

This particular DVD in the series deals with issues surrounding Israel's Promised Land.  We learn about the Old Testament books Joshua, Judges and Ruth.  It would be an impossible task to cover all of the material in these books within the confines of the DVD.  Phil Vischer (who makes frequent appearances on camera) and his team chose some important topics and characters to introduce to the viewer, allowing us to learn the general theme of the scriptures. Some of the material isn't as riveting as a Larry Boy episode, but it covers Biblical events that children typically aren't exposed to until later in life.  Questions such as ""Why is there so much fighting in the Old Testament?"" and ""Did God want people to die?"" are addressed. Vischer and his team make it understandable for their audience.

The disc also comes with some fun extras.  There's a bonus animated short with Quacky the Duck that addresses loving others, especially our enemies.  This short will especially appeal to younger viewers.  The Show Outtakes track is hysterical, and there's a ""deleted scene"" from the minivan-riding boy Michael that has a bit of Monty Python-esque humor.

I watched this DVD with my two boys, ages 10 and 5.  Both of them loved it, asking to repeat certain scenes because they enjoyed them so much.  This is not only an entertaining program, but it really would be a great series to watch as a whole family.  As an adult, I didn't find the childish humor annoying--rather, I found myself laughing along with the kids.  And I personally learned a few things about God's word, which of course was beneficial to me as well.  This is a wonderful series, and I look forward to the upcoming Volumes 5 - 13.",1290211200,,2983,4.7925636007827785

While I tried to get all six kids to watch it, I just couldn't interest the 17 year-old and the 3 year-old was all excited about hearing familiar voices (from Veggie Tales), but it didn't hold her attention for long. She did think that the guys singing the Judges song sounded like the Jonas Brothers (yes, she does watch way too much Disney Channel).

However, the other 4 really enjoyed it. Here are their 'reviews':

Q's:
1. What did you learn from it?
2. Did you find it entertaining?
3. Would you watch the rest of the series?
4. Who was your favorite character?

Mac (age 9):
1. I learned about different books of the bible, like the historical books.
2. Oh yeah!
3. Yes
4. The pirate. He was really fun!

Little Soldier (age 10)
1. I learned what the 1st five books of the bible are called.
2. Yes, very, it was hilarious!
3. Yes
4. Pirate Pete

Abs (age 12)
1. Thanks to the Sunday School Lady, I learned that it took a woman Judge to finally do the job right.
2. Yes, it was funny.
3. Probably
4. Pirate Pete

Toast (almost 15)
1. The names of all the Judges.
2. Yah, loved the satire and sarcasm.
3. Yes
4. Pirate Pete and the old ladies on the couch.
My thoughts...

I will admit that I am not a huge fan of t.v. and most kid shows. I don't usually sit and watch movies with my kids, I let my husband do that. I do however, LOVE Veggie Tales and that is why I signed up for this blog tour.

That being said, I was able to sit through the entire hour long DVD. Had it been something like Boz, I would have left the room. (No offense to Boz, my 3 year-old loves him, I just can't do kid shows.) ""What's In the Bible?"" was entertaining and kept my attention. There were a lot of things they covered that I know I have never taught my children and probably should. In fact, I am pretty sure the last time I covered the book of Judges was when my senior was in 2nd grade.

However, it was not like Veggie Tales. I think I secretly hoped it would be :)  My older kids were more than fine with that. They think they are too old for Veggie Tales and pretend that they only watch it because the baby wants to see Bob and Larry.

My kids really seemed to enjoy the DVD. When they came in the door from church tonight I was replaying part of it and the 14 year-old did the shrieking thing that teenagers do and exclaimed, ""I love this part!"". They have also been singing parts of it for a few days and anything that can stick in their head that long and include biblical truth is a good thing.

All in all, I think it is a good product and definitely a DVD that we will watch again. I will most likely purchase the first three for Christmas. They will be a nice addition to my Veggie Tale collection.

Fine print: I was provided with a complimentary copy of this DVD for review purposes. The opinions expressed are all mine (and my kiddos) and I was not required to give a positive review.",1290038400,,3896,4.237516869095816
4690085,5,B005GD005Q,"I am very excited about a new DVD series for kids from Phil Vischer, the creator of Veggie Tales called ""What's in the Bible?"" We were given given a copy of the 4th video ""Battle for the Promise Land"" to review for Tyndale. Based on the cover I wasn't all that excited about watching it but I was hooked within the first minute. I loved the bantering back and forth between the puppets and how they all helped each other learn about ""housewares,"" er... I mean the historical books of the Old Testament. :) The focus on this DVD was on the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. There was some review of what had happened in the Pentateuch (that I am assuming were discussed in the first 3 videos) with fun songs to help remember the first 5 books of the Bible.

The first episode was part review and mostly about the book of Joshua. The favorite song of all 4 of my kids is ""You can't stop a Train."" They loved the silly impossibilities that are summed up with ""Standing in the way of what God is going to do will be really, really, really really not so good for you."" My 10 year old summed up what he learned in that episode by saying, ""I learned that if people stand in God's way God will give them what they deserve if they won't repent, like Pharaoh died and the Canaanites died because they tried to stand in God's way.""

The second episode focused on the books of Judges and Ruth. I thought that they gave a good representation of the Cycle of Apostasy from the book of Judges. My 6 year old summed that up by saying, ""I learned that they kept on bowing down to idols, then an army came, then they turned to God, then God sent a guy to rescue them, then they bowed down to idols again. It's hard to understand why they turned back to idols when they just got saved by God but it's true stories."" What a a great discussion starter with my 6 year old!

Here are some things I loved about the DVD:
* the focus on the fact that the Bible is true and helping kids to understand it.
* the focus on God's rescue plan of redemption that is tied throughout the Bible.
* it explains difficult concepts (redemption, holy, sanctified) in a way that makes sense to kids.
* ""Tricky Bits with Phil"" explained a difficult question in a way that made sense to everyone and left me with an ""ah ha"" moment.
* fun songs to help kids learn the books of the Bible. My kids have so many Veggie Tales songs memorized and I am excited to have them memorize the songs from these movies so that they can have the books of the Bible and where they are and what they are about memorized.

I think that these DVDs will be great to watch together as a family because they are great discussion starters and can be referred back to time and time again as different challenges come our way. They will also give us all a good overview of the Bible. I think these DVDs would be great to use for a neighborhood Bible club as well.

I asked each of the kids to write a review of what they thought of the DVD and my 4 year old said, ""My favorite character is the pirate. It will be good to watch as a family. It is funner than Veggie Tales (if you ever watched them) because it is a Bible story about it and we have not got Bible stories ever as movies. The guy in the car didn't know the rest of the Bible and he was going to learn it through the story.""

I think that these DVDs will be a great way to learn more about the Bible and His-story as a family and to share with others to introduce them to Christ in a non-threatening means. My 8 year old summed up all of our feelings when she said, ""I can't wait until the rest come out because I really want to own all of them.""

Phil is back with a series that provides children with amazing biblical information. My children have learned things from these DVD's that I only learned in my college Bible classes. Truly, the content is outstanding and presented in such a relevant and age-appropriate way.

Our family was recently given the chance to review the newest DVD in the series. The Battle for the Promised Land. This is the fourth DVD in a 13 DVD series. The first three are amazing and we knew the fourth would not disappoint. This edition dealt with Joshua, Judges and Ruth. Through humor and song children are exposed to biblical truths and vocabulary on a level that they can understand. One of my favorite parts of this particular video was dealing with the ""Big Question"" (each movie has a tough question on it dealing with the Christian faith). This particular question involved why were there so many wars. I loved the gentleness and simplicity of the answer given. Amazingly simple, yet something that even most adults have trouble rationalizing. Oddly enough we discussed this topic at church just this past Sunday. My other favorites involve the fun pop-culture jokes aimed at parents. It keeps me laughing.

My youngest wanted to give her opinion as well, so here it is as dictated by her: My favorite part is the song about Ruth. I think it is very funny. The silly may sings the song about them and it makes me laugh. Ruth and Boaz loved each other. But I don't think they really burst into song, did they? Oh, and my favorite character is the Sunday School Lady. I really like the What's in the Bible series and can't wait for the next one to come out.

4690087,5,B005GD005Q,"This is my second review for the What's In The Bible DVD series, put out by Tyndale and created by Phil Vischer, of VeggieTales fame.

My kids love these DVDs. They are easily their favorite movies to watch, and as I've stated before, the videos are chock full of good, solid biblical teaching, much of which I didn't even have a really thorough grasp of myself! WITB #4 covers Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. They are full of hilarious puppet characters, from a conservative priest to two Aussies on safari to Cap'n Pete (Tristan's personal favorite), a pirate who spends most of the episode in a hot air balloon. :)

I asked Will a few questions about the DVD:
What did you learn from the DVD? I learned a lot of stuff about the Bible I didn't know before. I learned what the Pentateuch is. (That's actually from WITB #3..) and I learned about obeying God.
Do you like WITB? YES! I loooooove it.
Would you like to watch the next WITB DVD? Yessssssss!! (grinning, crossing his eyes, and panting like a dog.) [Ummm, ok.]
Who is your favorite character? The Bentley Brothers! They are so funny and I love their songs.

I have sat and watched WITB with the kids a few times. The kids ask all kinds of questions during the show if I am sitting with them, which I love. We get to discuss things like Israel's cycle of apostasy and why they didn't have a king like their neighbors and who the judges were and what they did. It's great discussion, and the kids are really learning the foundations of the Bible in a fun and easily assimilated way.

And now the best part: I have been given a coupon for a FREE WITB # 4 DVD! I will be giving it away to one random commenter on my blog.

So who is the genius behind this series?  In 1990, 24-year-old computer-animator Phil Vischer sat down to create a group of characters that could teach Christian values to kids in a delightfully different way.  A tomato named Bob and a cucumber named Larry were born.  VeggieTales would go on to revolutionize Christian film making, selling more than 50 million videos and placing Phil's faith-filled stories in one in every three American households with young children.

Phil continues to pursue innovative new ways to integrate faith and storytelling through his new company, Jellyfish Labs.  His projects include Jelly Telly, which provides faith-based daily programming via the Internet at JellyTelly.com.

My Thoughts:  I cannot say enough about this DVD series.  It just doesn't tell stories from the Bible, it connects the stories and events of the Bible together to help us understand His whole story.  Our family has enjoyed watching the first four DVDs together and I am glad we watched them that way!  There were many things that even my husband and I learned.  It was also nice to be able to answer any questions our daughter had during the movie.

The characters are hilarious and each one has their own personality.  My favorite would have to be Buck Denver, but I also like to watch the Popsicle Stick Theater with Chester Widget.  Below you can see a clip of them both.

Thoughts of a 7-Year Old:  I learned that the book of Judges is about different judges who gave peace to the Israelites. When each judge died, the Israelites started doing evil things. The book of Ruth is a simple book, only a few pages long. It is about how Ruth's husband dies and her mother-in-law wouldn't leave her, so they went to a grain field and then they lived there. Then a man named Boaz married her.  I like all of the characters and I would watch the rest of the series because I learned a lot and they are really exciting and funny.

Our whole family sat down to watch this - my wife and I, our 7 years old and 3 year old. They watched both 28 min episodes straight through - and then again the following day. This is truly family entertainment. And the questions that it raises were just great - Sam, my 7 year old kept asking more and more questions about the scriptures. What more could you ask.

The DVD is very entertaining. I think kids are going to love this series. I think it is great what Phil is doing. In my opinion kids these days are not learning enough about the Bible, and its history and the story that it tells.

I think that with the way that the Bible is being presented it will engage children and make them want to learn more.

I think that these films will fit into any church curriculum very well and will be a great addition to any families DVD library. As a parent and uncle I can see the benefits that would come from watching this as a family. It is as entertaining for the adult viewer as it is for the child.

4690091,4,B005GD005Q,"This is the first What's In the Bible? DVD my family has watched, and it will not be the last.

Oh, wait. Am I supposed to give my conclusion at the beginning of the review?

Ah well.

If you're not familiar with the What's In the Bible series, the recent and masterful (at least if this edition was any indication of what the others are like) venture of Phil Vischer (yep, the Veggie Tales Phil Vischer), you will do yourself a favor by sliding over to whatsinthebible.com and educating yourself a little bit. While the Veggie Tales episodes and movies take Biblical stories (or Biblically based stories) and present a message, What's In the Bible? walks through the Bible itself. It's like a survey class for kids.

You can think about it this way: Veggie Tales entertains with the hopes of educating along the way, What's In the Bible? educates with hopes of entertaining along the way.

In this particular DVD that I'm reviewing, the fourth in the series so far, the focus was the ""Battle for the Promised Land,"" and goes through the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth. If you were to look at the back of the DVD case (which we all do when we first receive a new video), you find a couple questions at the top which the video was looking to answer for kids. These peeked my interest immediately: (1) Why is there so much fighting in the Old Testament? and (2) Did God want people to die?

Those are excellent questions. And as you and the family go through the videos, those questions stay in the back of your mind. You wonder how the answers will come. What perspective will Vischer take here?

Now, I'm not going to give out Vischer's answer to the question. Hopefully you'll be able to view it for yourself. But there is something I will say. Whether or not you agree with the answer isn't exactly the point. I did not get the sense that solving all the dilemmas and major debates among theologians was the focus here. The point was about the dialogue, the conversation among the family members.

Yes, I do think Vischer answered from his own heart, and did so based on his studies and perspective on things; and I also think he would stand by his answer. (And, for the record, I was not satisfied with his answer. *drama building*) But the walk through of the Scriptural text and then presenting some questions in light of the text are intended to be a tool. Vischer's response is meant to be a tool for parents to be able to engage better in the dialogue with their children about some of these difficult questions found in the Biblical narratives.

The humor is quality, for both kids and adults.

And if you haven't been introduced to the Bentley Brothers, you must.

Our kids paid keen attention, and actually learned. It was entertaining while giving families an opportunity to talk more about the Bible together. I think this DVD, as well as the rest of the series (again, if this is any indication of what the rest is like) will be a welcome edition to a young family. There are three prior editions already published, and looks to be 9 more to come (so, 13 when all's said and done).",1288742400,,3098,4.494661921708185

October 30, 2010 by Book Reviewer | Edit

I received a DVD from Tyndale House Publishing titled, ""What's in the Bible?"" to review and give you our thoughts. My daughter Alexis and I watched it, and I must say that I was very impressed. Alexis sat still the whole time, and was very interested in the contents of the DVD.

I asked Alexis (age 11 years), if she would share with you what she learned and this is what she said. ""What in the Bible is about the Old Testament. It taught me about the 12 parts of the Historical sections of the bible. I learned that this included Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, First and Second Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther. The DVD was easy to follow, and very entertaining. I told my friend that she had to come over and watch it with me.  I had already given my neighbor a certificate for the free DVD, so she said she wanted my copy! No way! My mom will order her a copy for her to keep.""

Alexis was very excited and she absolutely loved the Captain character and his singing in the Hot Air Balloon. As a mom, I knew that Alexis was getting good solid, biblical teaching from the DVD, and I would recommend that even younger children watch it.

Episode 1 - Finally, the Promised Land.  This episode is about the book of Joshua, and it covers the four different sections of the book.  I appreciate how they cover more than just the exciting stuff - the battles at the beginning.  They at least touch on the entire book.  There is a comment made about how the section where they are dividing up the promised land by tribe might be pretty boring for us, but this was very important to the Israelites.

Episode 2 - Circle of Misery.  This episode covers the book of Judges and Ruth.  The main idea presented has to do with the apostasy cycle.  This is one of the things I really, really like about What's in the Bible.  They do use big words, explaining them in ways that are understandable even to my youngest kids.  They aren't dumbing things down in their explanations.  There is also a great popsicle stick puppet section on Ruth.

While I'd rather not bring this up, what makes this particular video 4 starts instead of 5 is the opening segment where Michael is talking to his little brother.  These sections are usually quite funny, but this one involved a discussion of SpongeBob underwear.  Why is this necessary?  Not only that, but in the second episode, Cap'n Pete (who is up in an air balloon) has to use the bathroom.  So everybody keeps talking about how he is singing extra short songs because he needs to go to the bathroom.  Why?  Can't we get through a children's show without this level of humor?  Only my four year old found this at all funny.

The positives definitely outweigh this negative though.

My children (ages 4-13) all love this video.  They are all learning from it, with some particularly appreciating the song that names all the judges, and others who enjoyed the  Cycle of Apostasy illustration.  They all love Clive and Ian.

As an adult, reading the Bible is it's own reward because I understand the power behind the Words. Children cannot grasp this concept yet. They do not fully understand why it's important to read the Bible and know God's word, thus the hope of retaining any information could be small.

However, if we can take a few simple steps to make the Bible come to life for them, retaining some of the information may be easier for them.

One such way to enrich this experience is to include a neat series called ""What's in the Bible"", created by Phil Vischer -- maker of Veggie Tales. After you sit down with the family for a time of Bible reading, you can take the lesson a step farther by enjoying a related episode as a family.

We watched this together, all of us, and it was so neat because we could clarify things for our children if they didn't understand. Or we would take it a step further and teach a little more from what the episode was conveying. It offered some good opportunities for further discussion.

My 8-year old daughter had this to say about the episode, ""Battle for the Promised Land"", which included a story about Ruth because this began the family of the godly king:

  Ruth once had a husband in Moab, but he died after about 10 years. Ruth's mother-in-law was sad, too, so she decided to move back to her real home, Israel. So she packed up and left. Ruth saw her mother-in-law and decided to move with her. She said, ""Where you go, I will go, and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God."" There were lots of wars in historical times. One of the famous people, in Judges, was Samson. He was very strong. The episode was very entertaining with music and laughter. If I could, I would watch the other episodes to help me learn more about the Bible. I love the Sunday school teacher because she explains more about the Bible. I never knew Deborah was the only female Judge. I also learned that there are sections in the Bible and the first one is called the Pentateuch. It includes Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.

4690095,4,B005GD005Q,"This was one of the more fun reviews I've been able to do on my blog.  We received a copy of the DVD What's in the Bible? Battle for the Promised Land to review as a family.  This is a DVD made by Phil Vischer (Veggietales fame and Jelly Telly). Mali and I watched it together and then Eleri caught the last part.  Mali was pretty entertained throughout the DVD.  She loved the songs and just the silliness of the DVD.  She did seem to loose some interest during the question/informative sessions with Vischer, but then the songs/puppets brought her interest back.
I enjoyed watching the DVD with Mali.  Mali thought that it was fun to watch and wants to watch more of them.  She has asked several times after our first viewing of the DVD to watch it again. Her favorite character in the series is the ""kid in the van"" although almost all of the characters made her laugh.  When I asked her what she learned she said ""a lot"" but narrowed it down to ""not to bow down to fake God's"".  This opened up time for us to talk about what fake gods were and that even though she doesn't have fake gods around her like the Israelites did that her toys and really anything that is more important than God is a fake god.  I shared with her some of my struggles with fake gods, like myself and even her! The What's in the Bible series are very factual and informative with some silliness thrown in.  Puppets are used to make the DVD interesting with songs and appearances by them Phil Vischer answers questions specific to the book of the Bible featured in that DVD.  This episode focused on Joshua, Judges and Ruth.  It was fun to learn with Mali because I have just recently studied Ruth myself.  Mali really engaged in the DVD and answered questions as the puppets and Vischer asked, such as ""you've heard of Jericho?"" Vischer addresses facts and questions that we all have as Christians, not just child like questions so it is relevant to the whole family.  These series would be great to watch during a family time or devotional time and I certainly don't feel guilty plugging in the DVD player in the car to let my children listen to absolute Truth and instruction in the Word of God. I think watching these DVDs is more informative than entertaining but that is the appeal to the whole family.  I really liked that this series doesn't just choose popular Bible stories to focus on but focuses on teaching the truth of each book of the Bible.  It is like going to bible study as a family! Vischer also includes interactive real life examples of how to apply what the DVD is teaching.  Like going into how we all sin! I really recommend this series to all of my friends and family.  I hope that we will be able to expand our collection in the future too.",1288051200,,2745,4.3893280632411065
4690096,2,B005GD005Q,"When the kids and I received this in the mail, we were so excited!  I was curious to see it since it is by the creator of Veggie Tales, Phil Vischer.
The use of puppets in this video is engaging and funny.  Stinky and I did this review together and we let Bubba go ahead and join us. This is a great video to watch as whole family! It answers questions like ""Why was it ok for the Israelites to kill the people when they moved into the Promised Land?"".  And if there is something that the children don't understand, when you watch it as a family you are right there to explain more fully.  Or if you don't know the answer yourself, research it together!

There was some cute and catchy songs in the DVD.  My favorite was the Historical Books song sung by the pirate.

I had Stinky answer a couple of questions so that she could take part in this review with me.

Q. Did you learn from it?
A. Yes I didn't know there were books called Historical Books.

Q.  Did you find it entertaining?
A.  Yea, some things were funny.

Q.  Would you watch the rest of the movies?
A.  No I wouldn't want to.

Q. Who was your favorite character?
A.  The pirate because he went up in the hot air balloon and sings.  He's also funny.",1287878400,,1214,4.141630901287554

We have even learned things we didn't know! It is not fluff or just a revisit of the bible stories. It is meaty in what it is teaching and it is hilarious to top it off.

None more so than a new character introduced in volume 3, Marcie the stage manager.  That minor quibble aside, our whole family loves these DVDs.  My wife and I learn just as much as the kids.",1492473600,,332,4.5
