8468859,3,B005ER6SOQ,"Nazareth are dinosaurs, plain and simple. They've had great songs and great albums, but their heyday passed more than twenty years ago. The two ""new"" members of the band have been around almost twenty years, so that gives you a hint on the fossil ages of original (and current) singer Dan McCafferty (66), and original (and current) bassist Pete Agnew.

On to the concert. Well, we get a full screen picture that has some pixilation and some shaking from the drums, but it's serviceable, and the stereo sound is pretty nice. The entire performance is slightly tired and pedestrian. McCafferty looks road weary at times, and as much as he loves to tour, this is probably at the tail end of one of them. Here's a look at the history of the band.

Wikipedia
Nazareth formed in December 1968 in Dunfermline, Scotland, from the remaining members of semi-professional local group The Shadettes (formed in 1961) by vocalist Dan McCafferty, guitarist Manny Charlton (ex Mark V and The Red Hawks), bassist Pete Agnew, and drummer Darrell Sweet. They took their name from Nazareth, Pennsylvania, which is cited in the first line of The Band's classic song ""The Weight"" (""I pulled into Nazareth / Was feelin' about half past dead...""). Nazareth's cover version of ""Java Blues"" by The Band's bassist/singer Rick Danko and Emmett Grogan is on their 1981 live album Snaz.

The band moved to London, England in 1970, and released their eponymous debut album in 1971. After getting some attention with their second album Exercises, released in 1972, Nazareth supported Deep Purple on tour, and issued the Roger Glover-produced Razamanaz, in early 1973. This collection spawned two UK Top Ten hits, ""Broken Down Angel"" and ""Bad Bad Boy"". This was followed by Loud 'N' Proud in late 1973, which contained another hit single with a cover of Joni Mitchell's song ""This Flight Tonight"". Then came another album Rampant, in 1974, that was equally successful although its only single, ""Shanghai'ed in Shanghai"", narrowly missed the British Top 40. A non-album song, again a cover version, this time of Tomorrow's ""My White Bicycle"", was a UK Top 20 entry in 1975.

Hair of the Dog was released in April 1975. The title track of that album (popularly, though incorrectly, known as ""Son Of A Bitch"" due to its hook lyric) became a staple of 1970s rock radio. The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by The Everly Brothers, and also covered by Roy Orbison, the melodic ballad ""Love Hurts"", that was released as a hit single in the UK and in the US, where it went platinum. The track became the band's only US Top Ten hit. and was also a top 10 hit in nine other countries, reaching number 1 in six of them. The song spent a record-shattering 60 weeks on the Norwegian chart.

In 1979, second guitarist Zal Cleminson was added to the line-up, remaining for two albums, No Mean City and Malice in Wonderland, and contributing numerous compositions. Malice in Wonderland contained the single ""Holiday"". In 1981, they contributed the song ""Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)"" to the soundtrack to the film, Heavy Metal.

Various Nazareth line-ups continued to make studio albums and tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although their popularity had declined such that some albums no longer received either a UK or a US release. They remained popular in Europe, particularly Germany, where ""Dream On"" became a hit single. Billy Rankin returned for a second spell in the ranks in 1991 for the No Jive album, replacing Manny Charlton who pursued a solo career.

A tribute came in 1993 when Guns N' Roses covered Nazareth's ""Hair of the Dog"" on ""The Spaghetti Incident?"", consolation after they turned down Axl Rose's request for the group to play at his wedding. Rankin departed again in 1994, but with Jimmy Murrison and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy, Nazareth maintained a live following in Europe and the US.

In 1999, while touring the US, original drummer Darrell Sweet died at age 51 of a heart attack. He was replaced by bassist Pete Agnew's son Lee for later editions of the band.

As far as the DVD itself goes, there are no extras and not even any end credits, so you have no idea of any of the information I've provided from looking at the cover. There's not even a insert slip inside to help out. Very shoddy. Here's the tracklisting:

1. This Flight Tonight
2. I Want To Do Everything For You
3. Holiday
4. Dream On
5. Bad Bad Boy
6. Cocaine
7. My White Bicycle
8. Love Leads To Madness
9. Turn On Your Receiver
10. Love Hurts
11. Hair Of The Dog
12. Broken Down Angel

8468862,5,B005ER6SOQ,"I will disagree with the reviewer before me. I have it since it was released in UK under the title 'Live From Classic T stage. So take it as a referal for the track list. It was recorded live for TV. The only dissappointment is the lack of live audience, but this is kind of thing which is pretty normal for Brit TV. Dan sings as good as in Home Comming DVD, but the band sounds way tighter and heavier with no keyboards. Some rare live perfprmances from albums like Cinema, Catch, Rampant, 2X2 etc. Original release in Europe year 2005. I hope the review is helpfull.",1322265600,5,568,4.317757009345795
