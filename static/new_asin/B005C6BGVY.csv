4651700,3,B005C6BGVY,This is not the movie to watch to learn. It's the movie to watch because it has hot guys. I saw the other titles in the series and knew what to expect. If you're seeing this series for the first time just know that it's stupid and beautiful.,1315526400,12,241,4.041666666666667
4651701,4,B005C6BGVY,"The ""Eating Out"" series defies the standard rule that sequels are bad.  I liked the first installment OK.  The second was really good, and the third was excellent.  We've shown the second and third installment to a number of friends, and bought copies as gifts.  This fourth episode is good, but not as good as the second and third installment.  Mind you, I will absolutely buy the DVD and be happy to have it, but it is really missing a larger role for Rebekah Kochan because she is a highlight of any movie she is in.  It's too bad she wasn't around for ""Gone with the Wind""....it would have been a very interestingly different movie.  Definitely worth buying and watching, but also get installment 2 and 3 because those are even better.",1312934400,16,739,4.553030303030303
4651702,3,B005C6BGVY,"The boys from ""Eating Out: All You Can Eat,""  Casey (Daniel Skelton) and Zack (Chris Salvatore) get accepted in a well-known ""drama camp"" run by Dick Dickey (played by Drew Droege, coming across as Richard Simmons' evil twin), and face the first challenge to their relationship (which has been lukewarm rather than hot) as soon as Zack falls in instant lust with one of his fellow campers.  The boys, and some girls, as well as a transgender character, compete for an acting prize, while trying to keep their libidos under control (a camp rule), which isn't easy.

Like the first three films in this series, this is a very cartoonish but entertaining romp, filled with sight gags, overacting and unrealistic situations, with lots of hot, buff guys in simulated sexual situations to keep you watching.  It's a formula that works for writer/director Q. Allan Brocka, and you can't blame him for sticking with it (Be forewarned that film #5 is already in production). Personally, I'd watch anything that features Mink Stole, who reprises her role as Casey's aunt/landlady, but who now has a hunky younger lover who she met ""on My Face.""  Uh, yeah.

Won the audience award at Philadelphia gay film fest,  I give the film three stars out of five.",1311552000,15,1241,4.8254716981132075

It seemed really close but just off a tad which made the whole movie come across as uneasy to watch.

Most movies of this genre (""genre is genre"" as character Jason says) are sooooo poorly done: poorly acted, poorly photographed, bad script.  I mean, really.  In this day and age?  This movie was well-directed, great script, and very well photographed.  But the casting was either perfect or serendipitous: the chemistry between actors Chris Salvatore and Aaron Milo (good name, by the way) just makes the whole movie.  When they look each other in the eyes, I feel like I should discretely leave the room!  A happy addition to my library.",1391299200,,655,4.9

4651772,2,B005C6BGVY,"I simply had to see it, since I watched the other Eating Out films recently. I was really hoping to see more of Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) again, but her screen time was very limited & not as hilarious as before.

There were a few stories in the film, some of them were pretty good.

Lilach Mendelovich as Penny made up for my lack of Tiffani, she maintained some fair humor for me. I think I am more partial to Tiffani, but the character Penny did deliver some laughs

Over all, not as great/funny as Eating Out; All You Can Eat, but the film is far from terrible",1332201600,,562,4.233644859813084
4651773,2,B005C6BGVY,"FIRST of all, the whole pretense of all  the  Eating Out Sequels besides the 2nd one are just based on very nakked guys and sex...at least the first two there was a plot and you could understand it.
BUT in this, 4th sequel, its just way too silly!
SPOILER: As a gay guy, there is NO way id ever break up with my BF in order to get him together with another guy, that's ridiculous and totally unrealisic!
Tiffany only had a cameo,and she should have been a major player in the entire movie!

I have seen how these sequels seem to work..in the 3rd one,they killed off the main2 characters from the first 2movies  ( Marc and Kyle) which was bad enough, but this 4th movie just goes to far in ridiculous situations and unfortunately,not all the hot nakked guys can make up for the lack of plot and the painful time that comprises this movie!

Id recommend the first two highly and strongly, but after that  RENT  Dont waste your money please!",1332115200,2,938,4.35632183908046

But the story line for this one wasn't as good. I was disappointed to see that Rebekkah Kochan only had a brief appearance in the movie, as I feel her ditzy blonde, slutty character is what helped make the other movies funnier. The woman at the camp who Casey became friendly with seemed to replace Rebekkah as Casey's faghag in the movie, and it just wasn't the same. This one was funny in some ways and it did feature some hot guys. Also, I don't want to spoil things for people who have not seen the movie yet, but I was also disappointed in regards to Zack and Casey's relationship.",1322870400,,737,4.271428571428571

Of course the first was the best and I am looking forward to the next one.  So even though it wasn't as good as the rest, it was pretty good.  I missed, damn I can't remember her name, but the Tramp that was so good in all the others, doesn't have a big enough part.

4651779,1,B005C6BGVY,"The first in the series was great but with each sequel the  films  became less and less  enjoyable.  This is the worst (and last for me).  Some dreadful (I mean 'really' dreadful) overacting from  the two teachers which made me cringe. If they could only see their performances. A very weak storyline which  was written on a postage stamp with room to spare. As the next in the series was filmed immediately after  this film , one can only shudder at the possibility  of having to endure another  time waster. Most of the cast are okay but no serious acting is  required from any of them. Time to bury the  hatchet on this series",1321056000,6,629,4.421052631578948
4651780,1,B005C6BGVY,"Forget how on earth this series is sputtering into a fourth and rumored fifth installment. The lure of cheap laughs combined with the promise of naked twink flesh will always find an audience regardless of sexual orientation. This effort is devoid of joy or entertainment which can't be covered up with stunt casting of reality TV ""celebrities"" Ronnie (Make Me a Supermodel runner-up) Kroell and Steven (Big Brother alum and nascent porn star) Daigle. Like me, fans of the series will probably not be able to stay away but anyone unfamiliar with the previous three films should avoid this garbage.

4651781,3,B005C6BGVY,"They are stretching Eating Out too much now. Staged at a summercamp... it's been (over)done. Rebekah Kochan should have been given a leading role again, but they didn't. Her role is small this time. Too bad! I liked that they added the transgender character, thumbs up for that! It was done in a respectful and believable way and the most interesting part. But other than that, the previous movies were better and funnier, especially the 3rd one. If you like twinks with hot bodies, you'll rate this movie 4 stars probably.",1320796800,,523,4.758241758241758
4651782,5,B005C6BGVY,"I was afraid that Eating Out: Drama Camp wouldn't live up to the rest of the series, when I read that series favorite Rebekkah Kochan only had a cameo in this one. Well, I am glad to say that her short appearance didn't hurt this entry in the series one bit. Eating Out: Drama Camp may actually be the funniest in the whole series, thanks to hilarious performances from Drew Droege as Dick Dickey, and Mink Stole. There's also plenty of nudity and sexual shenanigans on display as well, but that's to be expected from this series. All in all, this is definitely a fun movie and highly recommended if you liked the other Eating Out's.",1319846400,7,633,4.4655172413793105
8464900,2,B005C6BGVY,"Review contains SPOILERS. The plot line became unreasonable and frustratingly disappointing by the end of the movie. Who, having just broken up with your boyfriend following him falling for another man, would then help him hook up with his new fling minutes later? And then that same person also hooks up with another new person? Sad and ridiculous. I had previously watched the sequel to this installment, and now characters' actions in that movie make even less sense too.",1519257600,,474,5.012658227848101
