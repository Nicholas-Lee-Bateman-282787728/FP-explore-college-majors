4911100,4,B005ZMBDJU,"This film is completely devoted to exploring life, dreams and hope of Wolfgang Amedeus' sister Nanerl Mozart.  She was older than her brother and very talented musician herself.  She played violin and piano and also had a voice of an angel.  This period drama explores how it was to be an entertainer and travel all over Europe at that time.  She and her brother were each other's companions.  Luckily, both loved music so endless performances and rehearsals came natural to them both.  The difference between the two was that in the time they lived, a boy had all possibilities open to him, while girl's options were quite limited.  It was unheard of for a woman to be a performer.  It was expected of her to be a mother and wife and if not that than she was to devote her life to God and church and become a nun.

For most of her life, Nanerl devoted her life to tending to her father and his needs.  To some such demanding father may seem cruel; to others this father tried to teach his children music, grow their love for music and be a firm disciplinarian in order to ensure the highest level of music they presented in front of various european rulers.  He also had to adapt to the fact that his children will grow up into adults and that more permanent way of living arrangements and income flow will have to be secured for the family.  Not an easy task.

There are beautiful costumes, make-up and interior design in this movie.  Music is fabulous too.  The shortcoming of this movie is that some of the scenes that involve singing and performing are so poorly dubbed it is impossible to ignore it.",1332720000,2,1605,4.4673539518900345
4911101,5,B005ZMBDJU,"I loved this movie for reasons stated in above reviews as well: the movie has a beautiful atmosphere that really transports you to that time and that alone makes it well worth viewing. It is one of those rare movies that entraps you and really makes you forget you're watching a movie. The fact that it's about Mozart and his family and features wonderful music played by the two young siblings is the icing on the cake! Lovers of historical accuracy and fact checkers beware - you will find fault. But it is really a beautiful, lovely film that should disappoint no one interested in classical music, Mozart, and the time period. Yes, it does move slowly but again this is truly representative of that time period when things moved at a slower pace, not today's fast paced world - which only helps to immerse you in the experience!",1329350400,30,832,4.590604026845638
4911102,4,B005ZMBDJU,"I had seen the preview of this movie at my local independent movie theatre for quite some time, and had begun to wonder whether the movie would actually come to Cincinnati, but this past weekend the movie finally opened here, and I did not wait long t go see this, as I imagine this will not play very long (and the DVD is coming out soon as well).

""Mozart's Sister"" (original title: ""Nannerl, La Soeur de Mozart""; 2010 release from France; 120 min.) brings a look in the life of 15 year old Mari Anna (nicknamed Nannerl) Mozart. She is 5 years older than her brother and wunderkind Wolfgang, but Nannerl certainly has certain musical talents as well, in particular in playing the harpsichord. But it is not until after a chance meeting with the recently-widowed Dauphin of France that he encourages her to start developing her own composing talents. Alas, that is not the way her father sees is. There are some further turns and twists but I will let you discover those yourself.

Please note: this movie proceeds at glacial speed, and I mean this as a complement. It reflects, among other things, life in the late 18th century when things simply moved a lot slower and there was not a whole lot to do to entertain one-self. I found it refreshing, to be honest. Also note: if you are not a fan of classical music, you are probably not going to like this movie, as classical music is front-and-center all over. It appears that people in those circles really didn't have a whole lot more to do than to play or listen to classical music. The harpsichord is delightfully featured prominently throughout the movie. Last but not least there are the tremendous performances, none more so than Marie Feret as the title character (not sure if she is related to the director of this movie, Rene Feret), but check out also Lisa Feret (again, no idea whether related to either Mmarie or Rene Feret) as Louise of France. In all, I found this movie refreshing and insightful, but this is definitely not for anyone in a hurry. Highly recommended!",1326844800,72,2033,4.613259668508287

4911104,4,B005ZMBDJU,"This movie is well-written and very well acted by a high-quality cast, including several talented children & young people (meaning, actors less than 18 years old).  Quite apart from the perhaps obvious fact that it includes a lot of excellent music!  The movie takes place almost entirely in & around Paris; Wolfgang (Wolfi) is 10 years old, the title character Anna-Maria (Nannerl) is about 15.  The movie focusses on Nannerl's struggle to emulate her brother, whose musical talent she shares, in musical training as well, in spite of the discrepancy in sex which, in their father's eyes, is absurdly severe.  As long as one can bear in mind that, no more than Milos Forman's Amadeus, this is not a documentary (several of the events supposedly taking place during the movie actually took place years before the protagonists were born), it is extremely enjoyable.  The one warning/caveat that might be worth making is that the movie is in French; English subtitles are available.",1448150400,2,980,5.0246913580246915

4911106,2,B005ZMBDJU,"Sorry I cannot be more possitive in rating this movie. Historically it may be accurate, which I ignore, but to my tste the story is presented in such a languid, slow moving pace that required effort to sit and watch it to the end. Perhaps the addition of some more Mozart music could have helped. On the positive side, the pictures of places and palaces are good.",1440720000,,363,4.432835820895522

4911108,5,B005ZMBDJU,"If you do not like films about pre-teen girls growing up or want to sit through another film about brother sister rivalry then perhaps this DVD is not for you.  But do not discard it yet for in this story, those pre-teens are the daughters of King Louis XV of France while that brother and sister is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and  Maria-Anna, better known as Nannerel.  And she is the focus in this movie not her more precocious little brother.

In this story we are transported back to the 18th century with sumptuous costumes  and gorgeous landscapes as we follow the fortunes of the Mozart family on their travels to Paris. There are views of the young Mozarts playing  the music of their time in front of the various courtly audiences. And there are glimpses of the rigid social norms of the times.

There are some excellent roles from Mark Barbe (Leopold )  Nannerls' mother  (Delphine Chuillot )  and Nannerl played by the gorgeous  Marie Feret. Spoken in French with English subtitles, this beautifully presented film from 2010 is likely to have limited interest in America, but would suit the more sophisticated European market.  It has won a host of awards at Las Palmes and elsewhere.",1430870400,,1192,4.733009708737864

4911110,2,B005ZMBDJU,"What a miserable film.

Granted it is about a short look at the life of Mozart's sister - Nannerl - who was possibly a frustrated genius overshadowed by her brother and the sexist attitude of her father (and the times) - but did it have to be so boring.

I fail to understand the ravings about the classical music by other reviewers.  There is virtually none, only very brief excerpts that just about finish  as soon as they start.

If you like elegance, then as always the French can supply it.  For that I give it 2 stars.

I was so glad when the film ended, and I didn't have to wait further for something that was not there.  A big disappointment.",1412640000,,651,4.278688524590164

4911115,3,B005ZMBDJU,"Very sad. Thats my main complaint about this movie; nearly every scene was sad. Others have identified the historical inaccuracies, and these abound and do matter. But if it were really an enjoyable show, one might be willing to overlook chronological impossibilities. Certainly the movie Amadeus got away with murder on that account, turning Salieri, by all accounts a man generous with his time and in fostering genius (he taught Schubert without fee), into a man so insane with jealousy over Mozarts talent that he was capable of murder; it got away with the historical inaccuracies because it was a highly enjoyable movie with terrific musical scenes. So likewise The Great Caruso which bore no relationship to the actual life of Enrico Caruso but showcased a virile young tenor called Mario Lanza and lots of great music. But this film about Mozarts older sister was not only historically inaccurate, it was not enjoyable; rather, one is supposed to rail against the indignities visited upon females in that era, from the spectacularly talented Nannerl Mozart to the French royal princess Louise. Well, yes, girls and women were treated horribly in those benighted days, but don't blame me; I wasn't responsible for what happened centuries ago in foreign places and don't want to wallow in guilt in contemplation thereof. Great production values, fabulous costumes, terrific sets, OK acting, OK music, and trs trs triste.",1387411200,5,1426,5.150862068965517
4911116,4,B005ZMBDJU,"High quality producdtion values, magnificent costumes, settings and interesting script. Good acting as well. A wonderful insight into what we can suppose was the way of life in 18th century Europe:  travel, politics, inconveniences, art, culture, the caste system of royal court life. For history buffs and students of Mozart's family, life and music. The emphasis is on the family and how they navigate and operate in this daunting atmosphere of competitng prodigies, subservient courtiers and aloof royal personages. Some of the scenes are both heartbreaking and heartwarming:  Leopold's treatment of his daughter, Nannerl's odd friendships with some of the French royal offspring and how their world was structured. One brief scene was particularly striking:  Nannerl, Mozart's sister, singing in a chapel before a rapt audience (in some ways suggested to be in trade for food and lodging at a convent), attired in full court dress, accompanied by little Wolfgang at the organ and you can see her breath. Brings right to the forefront chamber pots, carriages bouncing along nearly non-existent roads that break down in the middle of nowhere, cold interiors where the fire must be tended constantly, bed sharing and stiff manners. The music is gorgeous as befits the look of the piece and suggests that we have lost something in our modern world where once whole families (whether professionals or not) gathered to make music on a regular basis. It's not necessarily a postscript to ""Amadeus"" but more in the vein of ""Vatel"" or ""Tu le Matin de la Monde"".",1386892800,2,1556,5.142292490118577

4911119,4,B005ZMBDJU,"This French production is the fictionalized biography of Maria Anna (Nannerl) Mozart, Wolfgang's older sister. The story has about the same amount of biographical fact as the famous ""Amadeus"" and the same idea of a dramatic point of view, mostly fictional. Where Amadeus deals with a drummed-up rivalry between the established Salieri and newcomer Mozart, ""Mozart's Sister"" deals with the conflict between the conventional and ambitious Leopold and his talented daughter. Nannerl is shoved aside in favor of the prodigy Mozart, and though it's not fully explained in the film, you can really get the sense how child prodigies and a good impressario (like Leopold Mozart, and for that matter, Ludwig von Beethoven's father) exploited the talent of their offspring to penetrate the elite circles of the aristocracy and gain wealth and fame. As an impressario, Leopold is both pushy and conventional, respecting the place of women (not to be educated or promoted, but to make a good marriage and be home with the children) while promoting Mozart as the true talent. Nannerl chafes under her father's despotic suppression and this is the heart of the film's feminist theme.

The film is beautifully produced, with stunning European countryside, palaces and best of all, the actors. Each one has a face that the camera adores and these faces (the Dauphin Louis, Nannerl, Leopold, and Louise of France especially) make you want to drink in each scene. The cinematographer works well in concert with the script, which leaves plenty to let you fill in the blanks--for example, the debauchery of the court at Versailles, under Louis XV and then his son, this Louis who died before he ascended the throne, a throne that ended in the bloodbath of the French Revolution under his son, Louis XVI. And the film beautifully combines the conflict of an indulgent court life combined with devotion to the Church, a historical fact from the lives of Louis and his sister Louise de France (""Chiffre"".) All this is suggested as in a sketch, rather than fully painted in dramatic detail.

By the way, I'm not sure why the subtitles called ""Chiffre"" ""chiffon"" because so far as I know ""Chiffre"" means ""the cipher"" or a mystery--Louise is naughty and playful, yet stern and pious at the same time; an interesting conundrum for an illegitimate princess. Not knowing French history will put you again at a disadvantage. Her birth on the wrong side of the blanket will explain why the royal family was completely happy she chose the cloistered life (or...did she choose it?) Convenient and discreet--it was a home for supernumerary aristocratic daughters, especially those of the illegitimate type. The abbey gets a huge dowry, the daughter is disposed of; everyone wins...well, except those who didn't favor a life behind the grille.

Though perhaps lacking in historical accuracy, the way this film develops the conflicts between family members (Mozart's and that of the French royal family) makes for stunning drama. While nowhere near as good a film as ""Amadeus"" it's still one I enjoyed watching and will probably watch again. You might want to review your French history before watching it as it deals with a lesser known member of the House of Bourbon.",1372809600,8,3233,5.039252336448598
4911120,4,B005ZMBDJU,"I am no Mozart expert, but I know there are certain things that the Mozart family meticulously documented (through extensive journaling and letters) and certain things that remain a mystery. Is it a stretch to say that Nannerl had such a close friendship with French royalty (bordering on an affair in the case of the dauphin)? Probably, but I'm just interested that someone thought enough of this unsung hero to make a 2-hour movie about her.

FACT: Nannerl was known to have been a very gifted musician and might have become quite famous if 18th-century society had accepted women as composers. FACT: Nannerl's talents were overshadowed by her brother, not because she was mediocre but because her brother was encouraged and trained more than her. Leopold Mozart was not an ogre but merely a practical man following the conventions of his day, which meant lavishing more music training on his son instead of his daughter. I was glad to see this distinction explained. Furthermore, Nannerl faced a further dilemma in life because although she was the sibling of a respected genius, she was not as ""gentile"" as some of her peers and friends (partly because she spent a great deal of time traveling and partly because she bothered to show her skills off to anyone beyond the family drawing room). This tension and catch-22 is explored in depth: music is what she knows and loves best, but she ultimately can't do anything with it in the real world, never mind that being an itinerant child musician meant sacrificing many opportunities to meet proper potential husbands and be trained in the more typical ""womanly arts"" that would have helped her to secure a good marriage (which was, after all, what most women hoped for and had to take very seriously). She is frustrated with the futility of what her life has been so far: respected but not admired, loved but not encouraged.

True or not, the family dynamics are fascinating. We sometimes forget that the Mozarts did all travel around together for a time and had to put up with some difficult and inconvenient situations (not being paid, not staying in ideal quarters, being weakened by ruthless diseases, etc.). Yet at the same time, they did have a good laugh on occasion. If you look at the letters they wrote to each other, you can often find humor, warmth, and devastating honesty in them. This family, despite all the crisscrossing they had to do, were a tightly-knit little clan. No doubt the Mozart parents had a real conundrum on their hands...not only did they have to raise their kids right, they had to learn how to deal with brilliant children yet be forced by society to play favorites. Perhaps Leopold WAS an overly ambitious slave-driver at times, but I always felt a little pity for him (more so after seeing this movie).

I found the relationship between Wolfgang and Nannerl to be rather sensitive. Wolfgang was a cocky little boy (who isn't at that age?!) but nonetheless a hard worker. Nannerl, being both the elder sibling and a girl, had to just grit her teeth and bear the odd little boy who was equally likely to belch the alphabet in 2 languages as write a beautiful sonata. At the same time, he *was* her brother, and their shared musical gifts probably helped them stay sane with each other in those early years of claustrophobic life on the road. Wolfgang is not portrayed as Damien and Nannerl is not twisted into an emo wrist-cutting teenager, which makes me happy enough to keep this movie in my collection. I'll leave the crucial history details to the obsessive professionals.

One thing that bothered me (or at least detracted from the content of the film) was the insistence on jerky cameras. In the entire movie, there were only a tiny handful of traditional filming techniques (steadycam, etc.). The rest of the film is shown with handheld cameras of some kind. I think this technique is highly overused and overrated at this point in time. Yes, it has its place, but use it ALL the time and the novelty wears off very quickly. It makes otherwise passable movies look like cheap, artsy, pretentious novelty pieces, and it's especially common in the European film world right now (which is, I'm sure, making it very hard for the genuinely good filmmakers over there to have breakout movies that appeal to American audiences).",1372636800,4,4314,4.794354838709677

4911122,2,B005ZMBDJU,"The movie was so slow and boring. They could have easily turned this into a 1 hour film. The historical inaccuracies were so egregious that it ruined it for me.

Mozart was born in 1756 and was 11 when this visit supposedly happened, bringing us to 1766. The Mozart family's main sojourn in Paris, when they performed before the Royal, was from November 1763 to April 1764.""

This movie was on Amazon prime so I got to watch it for free. If I had to pay to watch this movie, I would have been upset.  Not worth the money.  And the time I spent watching it may have been better allocated.",1370217600,2,694,4.390625
4911123,5,B005ZMBDJU,This flick can be surprising in the discovery that the family genius could have been inherited as well as reared.,1368144000,,113,4.7
4911124,2,B005ZMBDJU,"The premise behind this movie is promising. We know that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had an older sister, Nannerl, who was also a highly accomplished musician and was forced to give up her career when she reached marriagable age. In this biopic, the filmmakers invent a story for her that involves a steamy, if unconsummated, relationship with the Dauphin of France, the heir to the throne. There is no historical basis for such a relationship.

The filmmaker's central point seems to have been that because she was a woman, professional doors were closed to poor Nannerl. This is undoubtedly true. This point is hammered home, for those of us too dense to have understood it before, in a conversation between Nannerl and Princess Louise de France, the youngest child of Louis XV. Louise has decided to become a nun, seeing no other way forward. ""But think if we had been males!"" she says to Nannerl. ""I would have ruled through my power and you through your artistry.""

Incidentally, the Dauphin depicted in this movie died in 1765. Mozart was born in 1756 and was 11 when this visit supposedly happened, bringing us to 1766. The Mozart family's main sojourn in Paris, when they performed before the Royal, was from November 1763 to April 1764.

I know these details make me sound like a nitpicker and I don't require historical accuracy in movies -- otherwise I'd be pretty frustrated all the time. But this one has such a slender grip on the historical record that I could not take it seriously. Additionally, it moved at a sluggish pace and the actors often seemed to be reading rather than speaking their parts.

But the worst offense was the sound quality of the music, which seemed to have been recorded in a padded cell. And the music itself, rather than being Mozart, is a kind of modern, Baroque-style mishmash that sounds pretty in a kind of movie soundtrack way without ever being memorable.

I can accept that Nannerl was undoubtedly a prodigiously gifted musician, as was her tyrannical father Leopold. A few of his works are still played today and have some merit. Perhaps, Nannerl would have equaled him. But there was only one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.",1351555200,11,2164,4.79088471849866
4911125,4,B005ZMBDJU,"Anyone who loves classical music knows about the Mozart family in one version or another.  Wolfgang's elder sister, Nannerl, was as much of a child prodigy as he; both were exhibited in hopes of fame, cash, and glory by their father Leopold (not a shabby musician himself).  Nannerl is obviously the central figure of this film, that focuses on her being stifled musically by her father (the violin is not a proper instrument for a girl;  few people are capable of understanding composition, certainly not women).  She ends up accompanying her wunderkind brother on the ladylike harpsichord.  The rest of the plot I leave to the enjoyment of the viewer.

Obviously, in a film about such a family, a great deal of music is played.  Almost as obviously, actors, particularly prepubescent ones, are not musicians.  It is expected that the serious playing will be dubbed in by serious musicians in synch with the footage of the actors going through the motions, and this is the case with this film.  Obviously.  It is made even more obvious by the poor job done by the sound engineers:  all of the solo parts performed by Wolfie and Nannerl come it at less than 1/3 to 1/2 of the level of the ambient sound, dialogue, and accompanying musicians.  Since this production appears to be wholly owned by the Fret family, perhaps the cousin assigned to the sound board was incompetent, a great pity in an otherwise good film.",1351382400,2,1415,4.754098360655738

4911127,3,B005ZMBDJU,"While it may not be a popular opinion, I tend to agree with Grace Catledge.  I really wanted to love this film.  I too enjoy period pieces, and the idea of focusing on the tortured (artistically and societal) childhood of Mozart's eldest sister was very intriguing to me.  Granted, there is a lot to praise about this film.  The sets are astonishing, as are the costumes (so lavish yet so earthy) and the acting on all counts was genuine and felt organic and yet, as Grace's review points out, this film fell very flat.  It just started to meander, not really giving us anything and not really moving in any discernible direction.  It felt like a regurgitation of scenes and the fluidity that I felt in the film's outset was all but replaced by a feeling of stagnancy.  While I feel that the internal emotions being stirred here are beautiful to draw from (the way that poor Nannerl comes to terms with her own `place' in the family is heartbreaking for the audience to witness) the way in which the film is constructed leaves us waiting for something more to carry us home so-to-speak.  No, I was not expecting `Amadeus', but I was expecting to be engulfed in the film and that simply didn't happen.  The technical achievements are a dream, as is the classical music played throughout, but there is a passion that is missing here.  It is beautiful, sure, but somewhat dead behind the eyes.",1341964800,7,1390,4.5910931174089065
4911128,2,B005ZMBDJU,"This film just didn't do it.  I enjoy period dramas, have watched most of them, was not expecting an exciting plot, or fast moving story, but half way through, it really fell flat. There wasn't enough material to make a film about. Or the director didn't showcase the material well.  I don't know which. After the film made it clear that her talents weren't appreciated, there wasn't much more to tell. She was a great talent, and it was unfortunate that she wasn't given her due. Marie Feret was very good. I wish the director had spent more of the film in closer observation of her and not so much on her family which seemed like ""filler"".

The reviews on the DVD cover are exagerated. There is so much film garbage out that this seems like a good film in comparison. But this film was disappointing. I was really expecting to like it.",1341792000,4,837,4.457516339869281
4911129,5,B005ZMBDJU,"One great talent makes it big, and another from the same household doesn't.  What's the difference?  This is at the heart of what this film explores and exposes with due subtlety and pace observation.  It uses historically real people, but casts them in what is apparently (as there is no evidence that it actually happened as it is recounted here) a fictional situation.  So what's the point?

The point is that the emergent effects of real life do not develop at the necessary speed of entertainment.  So a compromise had to be made between what the makers of the film want to show within its historical time frame, and what the ""listening/watching-time-tolerance"" of most movie goers can muster.  The film was made for Europeans, a lot more used to sitting still through a musical concert without a lot to look at in the meantime (many even take to shutting their eyes throughout a performance); so we sit through a lot of auditory musicality during an essentially visual film sequence-- which gives some American viewers (more used to the sort of jazz and pop concerts where people get up and jump around) a sense of intolerable drag.  AS a European coming from something of an aristocratic background, I can tell you that slow and methodical was used to make people who fancied themselves to be in charge look calmly powerful; it served their perpetual efforts at holding on to power through day to day  intimidation of all the commoners who move at real-life speed--which is the essence of noblesse!  The idea of fiddling while Rome burns is a sign of supreme confidence that only those supposedly born to rule are believed capable of displaying (it is, of course, unnatural to the human ethos, so they have been meticulously trained for it since infancy).  Mozart rebelled against it-- as was illustrated by the frenetic quality of ""Amadeus,"" the movie that was about him in particular)-- and his sister merely surrendered to it-- as indicated by her excruciatingly long moments of silence in this film.  But that, folks, was an excellent symbolization of the way it really was, of the unremitting background reality of the lives of these people.  One gets the sense that the French Revolution is just building up outside the Dauphin's door (among REAL people trying to live REAL lives despite the UNreality of their rulers' existences), and the pointlessness of the royal existence comes across as reduced by then to the anointed family's self-indulgence and excess.  It is a world where the camouflage of lacking capacity to cope and the absence of genuine know-how by the masquerade of a deliberate-SEEMING pace has become the first principle of statecraft.  This movie captures that crap exquisitely, making the democratically minded in the audience absolutely want to scream!  This is the chocking atmosphere the bourgeois Founding Fathers of America were so concerned about when they feared governmental power.

Blindness to the other (the less fortunate commoners who have to EARN rather than inherit whatever they have) is what we discover is behind the metronomically controlled pace of the Hayden-type classical music score, the fraud it is supposed to cover up.  It reminds me of the adoration of natural beauty so typical of the brutality-drenched world of feudal Japanese, Chinese, and Korean aristocracy.  When two samurai encountered each other, they spent up to a half hour telling each other about their respective lineage of great fighters, but the actual fighting lasted only seconds (minutes at most).  This is a world where ""what you see is most definitely NOT what you get.""  Over and over again that sort of disappointment is heaped upon us like a sudden collapse of the roof in an earthquake.  Obviously, in that world, people of real talent and ability JUST CAN'T GET A BREAK!!!!!

So, don't blame the movie because we have come in the last two hundred years of so (and with a First World War to blow it once and for all out of our collective systems) so far from where we were.  It is a portrayal of where we were just before the French Revolution picked up on the American one and sprung the trap on the Ancient Regime.  The bygone people of high birth tried to show they were above the thing that humbles us all-- TIME!!  They tried to convince their subjects that time was indeed on their side, that they had all the time in the world.  They didn't grow old, because they owned all the resources and could imprison youth as their slave (as was the case when the heroine ended up married to a man of 50 with five children, and the one child she had would be appropriated by her by then elderly impresario father in the vain hope of reproducing through possession of his grandson's life the musical achievement he had accomplished in his younger years through possession of his son's life).  It wasn't just the aristocrats oppressed the common mass of people, but that commoners oppressed themselves with dreams of becoming oppressors of someone themselves.  It was a Ponzi scheme, where each layer recouped its losses by creating another layer of duped victims.

All in all, this largely fictional film captures with painful accuracy a departed world, but one always longing to come back as long as human beings age.  The idea is to stop the hands of the clock through the manipulation of progeny.  But, of course, what they didn't realize is that when you try to hold back the hands of the clock YOU WILL ONLY GET YOUR ARMS BROKEN.  I feel close enough to what I believe to have been the true story depicted in this film to say it was marvelously captured.  Even if it is taken only as an exercise, it is a great thing for would-be historians of the period to experience.  I saw it quite accidentally on Netflix, but I am now buying a copy for my library, for my students, and for my daughter and her children.  Too bad there is not a version dubbed in English!!!!",1337990400,3,5900,4.766961651917404
4911130,4,B005ZMBDJU,"In the 2010 French film (with subtitles) ""Mozart's Sister"", we the viewing audience certainly get an idea of what life was like for a woman in 1700s no matter how talented she may have been.  In this imaginary tale of Mozart's older sister Nanneral, Nanneral is shown as an extremely talented musician especially on the harpsichord and violin well able to perform and compose brilliantly.  However, she being a woman and Wolfgang's sister was viewed, especially by her father, as greatly inferior.

The events in the film occur on an imaginary concert tour the Mozart(s) took to Paris when Wolfgang was around eight (8) years old and his sister was interring puberty.  The parents doted on both their children and seemed to love them greatly.  Wolfgang, of course, was the ""great hope"" of the parents especially of his father.  After all, he was male and immensely talented.  All his sister could hope for was to accompany Wolfgang or to inter a nunnery.  In the film, Nanneral gets a respite from reality by forming a chaste relationship with Louis XV's son.  Louis XV's son becomes besotted with Nanneral and her talents having her disguise herself as a man in order to perform in the ""court"" and to be his ""short-lived"" confidant.  She relishes these opportunities and adores this ""freedom"" and the opportunity to ""show off"" her own talent void of a super talented brother.  But, alas, it is short lived and she has to return to being a ""woman"" and to the shadows of her brother.

""Mozart's Sister"" is beautifully filmed gorgeously recreating the era.  Yes, the film is rather ""slow paced"", to me, reflective of what life must have been like in the 18th century",1336694400,4,1664,4.796491228070176
4911131,4,B005ZMBDJU,"The world may be familiar with the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era and among the few classical composers that continues to be popular today.

But many do not know that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who was a music prodigy that played piano and violin at the age of 5, grew up playing as a duo with a musically talented sister named Maria Anna ""Nannerl"" Mozart.

Unfortunately, we do not hear too much about Nannerl.  Reason being is that during that era in time, women, no matter how talented they were musically, were not seen as equals to men.  Their status was lower and men thought that women just were not capable of having talent like men, may it be playing music or composing.  In fact, women were just seen as housewives, nothing more, nothing less.

In 2010, screenwriter/filmmaker Rene Feret (""Bapteme"", ""Solemn Communion"") wrote a fictional drama based on the life of Maria Anna Mozart.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

It's important to note that I am viewing a DVD screener ala DVR, so I am not going to comment on picture quality.  I will say that with a Blu-ray and DVD release of ""Mozart's Sister"" being released, I recommend going for the Blu-ray version for better picture and audio quality.

With that being said, ""Mozart's Sister"" is presented in widescreen 1:85:1 and audio in French Dolby Digital 5.1 with English subtitles.  The cinematography by Benjamin Echazarreta is very good in capturing close-up scenes of emotion but also the lavish costume and set design featured in the film, but most importantly capturing that look and feel of the 1700's.  The film is dialogue-driven but there are moments of music and ambience which I'm sure is much more evident on the lossless soundtrack on the Blu-ray release than the DVD version.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There were no special features on the screener disc provided to us.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Beautifully shot, wonderful costume and set design and a film that classical music fans will enjoy, while others will find it sad knowing that talents of women were suppressed during that era in time.

""Mozart's Sister"" is a sad film which writer Rene Feret really did some intriguing writing and craft a story around Nannerl Mozart, a talented musician who had to quit her passion because of the status of women during the 1700's.

While this film is a work of fiction and there is no record that Nannerl and Princess Louise of France corresponded, nor records that she and Louis le Daphin were romantically linked, what we do know is that because of that era in time, women could not really hold a high position in power or status.

For Nannerl, she was talented, she can compose and she can play, but once she reached a certain age (and her father could no longer promote her as a child musical prodigy), it didn't matter how talented she was, she was expected to be a housewife and raise children.  While I don't know if there are letters showing her regret of how women were treated at the time, as I am no erudite on Mozart historical records, I often wonder if this was just accepted by women that their status was low and not much was expected of them?

What is known is that Mozart looked up to his older sister and at a young age, wrote works such as ""Prelude and Fugue C, K. 394' in 1782 for the two to perform and even sent her copies of his piano concertos.  We know that Wolfgang and is father were always at odds, while his sister did everything that her father wished. And while she fell in love with one man, her father turned down his marriage proposal, despite Wolfgang trying to get his sister to stand up for herself.

So, there may be a different from what is featured of Nannerl in reality to what was Nannerl in the film.  In the film, Nannerl Mozart walked on the beat of her own drum and not that I would use the word ""fearless"" but she did what she wanted despite what her father would think.  But in reality, it was Wolfgang who walked the beat of his own drum and made his own choices, his sister did what her father asked.

And while the film is quite evident that the message was how unhappy women were that they weren't given the same liberties as men (as both Nannerl and Princess Louise have a conversation about how things would be different if both were born a boy), the sadness I have towards this film was the fact that the talented Nannerl had to give up so much and would never be recognized for her talent because she is a woman.

In reality, things even get worse as she was forced to marry a man who was in his '50s and had children, she died blind, unable to speak and even for her first son Leopold, her father Leopold literally took her son away and raised him.  While it is debated of why Leopold raised his grandson and not Nannerl, it is thought that Leopold wanted to raise his grandson in a similar manner to Wolfgang and Nannerl and for him to become a musical genius.

And last, that loving relationship between Wolfgang and Nannerl ended for some unknown reason.

If anything, the more you read about what is out there of Nannerl Mozart, it is quite depressing.  At least ""Mozart's Sister"" would make things a bit dramatic but I wouldn't be surprised if the reality was that Leopold had a tremendous hold over his daughter and literally suppressed all independence from her and that she had no voice whatsoever.  She listened to her father and did everything that he wished.

As I watched ""Mozart's Sister"", you have to give Rene Feret some credit of trying to make Nannerl's life so dramatic.  How he came up with the Princess Louise and Louis storyline was out of left field but for the film, it did work.

Feret's film doesn't follow the traditional Hollywood film of a happy ending.  We know that Nannerl is not going to be able pursue her life as a musician, we see in her face how unfortunate things are that her younger brother will have all the opportunities and she won't.

While purists and the Mozart erudite may be irritated by this fictional story, and possibly would rather see another film about Wolfgang than his sister, I did enjoy ""Mozart's Sister"" (although I felt it ran a bit too long for my taste).  The cinematography, costume and set design were beautiful, acting could have been better at times but for what its worth, while the film was banal, the fact that filmmaker/screenwriter Rene Feret was able to craft a story around Nannerl Mozart was rather fascinating but definitely opened my eyes and made me want to know more about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his family.",1335571200,10,6545,4.571917808219178
4911132,4,B005ZMBDJU,"Anyone who loves classical music should see this film, even though it is far from perfect.  The costumes, sets and settings, and the overall feel of the past, were awesomely beautiful.  Many times I saw shots that were so lovely, so much like paintings, that I could scarcely believe the people were modern-day actors and could move.  This excellence in that aspect of film-making made me feel closer to the era of Mozart than ever before.
That said, there were some negatives.  Some of the dialogue scenes were so low-key and quiet, nothing really DID seem to be moving - scarcely even the actors' mouths.  Notable in this regard were scenes between two Feret sisters playing Nannerl Mozart and Louise de France.  Maybe there was a desire to show a better style than the frenetic, anachronistic quality that characterized *Amadeus*?  Perhaps this represented an attempt at naturalism, as opposed to the loud-talking which generally characterizes film and TV (and has crept into society in general), but it didn't quite work.
As others have mentioned, the dubbing of the music was faulty. It was some of the worst I've heard.  The volume of the music was just too low, so it sounded as if it were coming from behind a wall.  That was especially so in instances of dubbing Nannerl's singing voice.  Also, I can't help mentioning what looks like a big (too big) wig on the boy Mozart, and some footmen standing around with bizarre looks on their faces!
The story is fictional.  Most of the events in the story never happened. Still, I am glad I saw this film and did enjoy it, and I do recommend it -- though not to the car-crash or murder-movie set!",1332979200,2,1648,4.6875
