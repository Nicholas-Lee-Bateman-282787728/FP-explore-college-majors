8648612,5,B00J7WVMRC,"Being a male dancer trained in multiple disciplines of dance, I showed a huge interest in The Next Step. The show is about a group of ten teen dancers who train at a dance studio called The Next Step and prepare routines to go to a regional dance competition. If they win at regionals, they are eligible to compete at nationals. It's a pretty good show that promotes teamwork, camaraderie, friendship, health and fitness, but does tend to get overly dramatic at times. Recommended to all you dancers out there.",1413244800,5,510,4.677777777777778
