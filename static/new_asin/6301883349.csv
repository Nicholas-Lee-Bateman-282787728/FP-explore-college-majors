7816352,5,6301883349,I remember going to the movies and you always saw a cartoon before the show.  I always wondered what ever happened to the cartoons about Snuffy Smith for he was one of my favorites.  I looked him up on Amazon and there he was so ordered the tape and now I can show the great grandkids the good cartoons instead of these they have today!!!,1360195200,,338,4.184615384615385
