6355400,4,B00JE3OGOA,I liked this movie because of the message.  It showed how selfish people can be; when they only care about what pleasures them.  No matter who it hurts. The actors were fairly good.  The storyline also was about giving someone a hand up.  I'm not going to reveal the storyline.  I love movies from the 30's to the 60's.  I think you will enjoy this one.,1439769600,2,353,4.2727272727272725
6355401,4,B00JE3OGOA,"Probation:
is a simple morale tale from the 1930's.  It is a good study of the mores and behavior problems during that time frame.  OK plot, simple.  characterizations were not complex and the theme was consistent with the plot.  Some altruism.",1412553600,,244,4.878048780487805
6355402,3,B00JE3OGOA,"Ruth, a wayward, extremely bored girl takes the wrong path in life, sinking into an abyss of despair. Alas, her descent just isn't very eventful. Ruth is a 30yo ""juvenile delinquent"", turned over to the court by a well-meaning adult. Ruth's brother, Nick tries to rescue her, but is he too late? Can he save her from a dismal existence? PROBATION is a rickety morality tale from 1932. Much of the ""action"" concerns the judge and his preachy conversations w/ his niece. Nick winds up as the niece's chauffeur. Many life-lessons are learned. If intense, histrionic melodrama doesn't frighten you off, then this movie might be agreeable. At a little over an hour in length, it still seems a bit long...",1411171200,,699,4.785123966942149
8650129,5,B00JE3OGOA,"Sweet movie involving upper crust young woman having her personality and values mirrored to herself by poor chauffer. Predictable, of course, but highly enjoyable and what a treat to see a very young Betty Grable! Hers was the only name I recognized in this film but I liked it and will search out other movies with the named leads.",1516838400,,332,4.6440677966101696
8650130,5,B00JE3OGOA,I bought this movie becouse Betty Grable is in it. I have most of her movies. She was not in it very much and sure does not look like herself. So young. The story was very good and I will watch it again.,1507680000,,203,3.744186046511628

8650133,5,B00JE3OGOA,"as a lover of old movies, this was one that I really enjoyed watching. wasn't to familiar with these actors, only a young 15 year old Betty Grable which this was my main reason why I bought this dvd. you will be surprised how she looked like.",1476316800,,242,4.170212765957447
8650134,4,B00JE3OGOA,"What a great little movie!! We just tried it for fun and enjoyed it a lot. Simple plot, black and white, real wind down movie. The bad guy gets it in the end without ANY fanfare for him.",1476316800,,186,3.9210526315789473
8650135,3,B00JE3OGOA,"This 1932 B/W movie tells an interesting story within a familiar Depression Era genre where class differences focus on the worthlessness of the profligate well-to-do class versus the simple respectable morality of the low socioeconomic class. Janet (Sally Blane) of big city upper idle class upbringing, is at a soiree of rich, worthless young adults, and is betrothed to Alec (David Rollins) a man of loose morals, from the get-go seen trying to kiss another woman when the lights go out during an adult group game. As the party ends, Janet has a conversation with her Uncle George (J. Farrell MacDonald) a night court judge, revealing an unease in her life and betrothal to Alec. She suggests she spend time with him at his night court to see how the other half lives, which she does.
Nick (John Darrow) a poor boy from Kentucky, having a hard financial time of it, lives with and supports his 17-year-old sister Ruth (a very young Betty Grable) in a tenement. Nick visits a pawn broker in his opening scene, to, it turns out, get funds to buy a birthday cake, ice cream, and a gift for his sister, when, upon arriving home with his packages, finds that she is out. He visits the landlady in the next apartment seeking information about Ruths whereabouts. She tells him that Ruth is being romanced nightly by an upper class visitor, and Ruth was reported to the youth authorities. She is in their custody. While this reveal is going on, Alec enters Ruths and Nicks apartment looking for Ruth. Nick returns to the apartment and finds Alec there, they fight, and Nick severely wounds Alec. Police are called, Nick is arrested.
Nick appears (of all places) in Uncle Georges court with Janet looking on, and pleads guilty but will not say why he beat up Alec. Under advisement, Uncle George remands Nick, as a chauffer, to probation for 6 months with Janet as his PO. They eventually hit it off, and fall in love. But Janet is betrothed and is to be married to Alec. Nick does not know that Alec is the groom Janet is going to marry. Under the goading of Uncle George, Nick goes to visit Janet at her luxurious home to push his case to marry her. While it seems Janet is actually marrying Alec because the wedding party is in full dress, this is not so because it was only a dress rehearsal! But with Alecs bandages off, Nick recognizes Alec as Ruths gigolo and goes after him again. The altercation is stopped. Alec flees the house in panic. The couple goes to an adjacent room, Nick tells Janet he loves her, and she says she loves him. Big kissy/hug! Another Hollywood ending, the challenge of a class mismatch hopefully to be resolved successfully. Whatever. Fade to black.
For a 1932 movie this was done excellently. However, the ending came upon us too quickly, as if financial backing hit the wall. Betty Grables appearance is just this side of a cameo role.",1473033600,,2863,4.6156862745098035
8650136,2,B00JE3OGOA,I found the storyline to be heavy-handed and sappy.  Early 1930s movies usually have a bit of a bite.,1465344000,,101,4.315789473684211
8650137,4,B00JE3OGOA,I thought this was a nice story. I adore movies from the 30's and their simple plot lines. This movie is no exception. Good story to watch on a cold winter day!,1448755200,,160,4.03125
8650138,4,B00JE3OGOA,"kinda typical love story, a nice cast and a interesting script. a little predictable but sassy and cuddly. I recommend you watch for yerself",1443052800,,140,4.875
