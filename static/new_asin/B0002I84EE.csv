2098492,3,B0002I84EE,"There is a lot of stuff in this DVD that is truly hilarious.  The ""Trivial Psychic"" skit, of course.  The ""Hardball"" skit where Walken does a brilliant performance of the French Foreign Minister.  The ""Cowbell"" skit.  The ""Pranksters"" skit.  Love it, love it, love it.

However,  I didn't like the ""Colonel Angus"" one, nor did I like the ""Making of the Continental"" extra, where Walken's character referred to the French as ""Frogs"".  Also, there were some sketches that just didn't make sense.  I don't really think those sketches belong in a ""Best of"" collection.

All in all, I gave the DVD three stars because the good is really good and the bad is, IMHO, what the ""skip"" button on your DVD player is for.  If you're a Walken fan, get it.  If you're an SNL fan, buy others first.",1098403200,8,782,4.546762589928058
2098493,4,B0002I84EE,"And the only cure is MORE COWBELL!!  I agree with some of the other reviewers here... They did leave out some classic sketches (rainbow head, for example).  However, this dvd is still worth watching/owning for the classics that ARE included.  I watched this by myself and couldn't help but laugh out loud during the ""Pranksters"" sketch.  Christopher Walken is one of the masters when it comes to the deadpan straight man.  I would have given it 5 stars if the sketches were a little more intelligently chosen.  Worthwhile, but not perfect.",1098403200,17,539,4.868131868131868
2098494,3,B0002I84EE,"I love Christopher Walken on SNL.  Along with Alec Baldwin's first appearances, most of Tom Hanks', John Malkovich's, and especially Kevin Spacey's, I think they are the best shows ever.

But this DVD disappointed me.

Of ""The Continental"" sketches, the funniest and best is still the first one they ever did.  And it's not here.

There are two other Continentals from the show and, in the Extras, there's another that shows both what the P.O.V. camera sees and what the audience sees (making this DVD worth seeing).

The favorite ""Cowbell"" sketch is already on the Best of Will Ferrell (volume 1).  The ""Lovers"" sketch, which I've never been a fan of, appears on volume 2 of Will Ferrell's Best.

So, for real SNL fans, we already have these.

Another gripe I have is that substandard sketches from more recent shows appear (like the Lifeboat and Centaur sketches) when earlier sketches have been completely ignored.  Chris as Rainbow Head on a late 80's show was much funnier.

Like with Will Ferrell 2, it just doesn't feel like anyone really worked very hard putting this collection together.  And I really don't think it's just a matter of taste.

But the Fonzie sketch in the Extras is great.",1096156800,79,1198,4.785365853658536
2098495,4,B0002I84EE,"Christopher Walken is probably one of the funnier and stranger hosts that SNL has had, multiple times.  Walken is at his best as Ed Glosser the Trivial Psychic- Nice homage to The Dead Zone, The Continental, Cowbell- Bruce Dickinson, and other insane characters like the PRankster who beats a guy for taking his parking space.  Walken is weird, but very funny.  Hard to imagine the guy from The Deer Hunter did work with Will Ferrell and company.  Although, I wish they had Stalk Talk on that disc.  Be a good note if they re-issue this set, again.",1095033600,6,548,4.608247422680412

2098497,5,B0002I84EE,"Just a hilarious DVD!  Walken is god on SNL.  From ""The Continental"" to ""Cow-Bell"" to the incredibly funny and well-writen ""Colonel Angus"" skit, this DVD is as must!  I NEED MORE COW BELL!",1094774400,2,188,4.636363636363637
2098498,5,B0002I84EE,"Chris Walken has been one of SNL's best hosts. He and Alec Baldwin are the only two people who have an open invitation to host whenever they want, schedules permitting. He is the second non-cast member to get a compilation DVD - the first was Steve Martin. He has appeared on SNL six times and his episodes have won Emmys for SNL the past two times he has hosted. The Fan Club [...] had been writing to NBC in hopes that they would do this, and we're just thrilled! I am really hoping there are some ""extras"" on there - we have the Will Farrell and Phil Hartman ones, and there are some good outtakes. When this aired on TV, I was actually disappointed that some of the great skits were left out. Chris did a wonderful dance scene with Molly Shannon for her Mary Kathrine character. He also did a hilarious skit called ""Stalk Talk"" Walken is great to work with which is why they keep asking him back. Buy this and you'll want to watch it again and again.",1093910400,7,954,4.276243093922652
2098499,5,B0002I84EE,"I watched the Best of Christopher Walken when it aired on TV. I was thrilled to see that it's being released on DVD because I laughed my butt off. CW nails his comedic timing, and he is the master of straight, cool kat one moment to a crooked grin character the next in this collection. This echoes his roles of playing dry humor in such films as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""True Romance."" My favorite sketches are ""The Continental"" and the ""Cow-Bell"" although Will Ferrell made that sketch happen just as much as CW. In ""The Continental"" I'd swear the second champagne in the face was an unplanned surprise to an unsuspecting Chris, but he maintains character albeit barely which is just as funny as his next line, ""You throw cham - pag - na on me once, then shame on you. You throw cham - pag - na on me twice, then shame on me.""  All this followed by the desperate door-blocking attempts. I've bought a copy for my dad.",1093910400,7,914,4.376470588235295

2098518,1,B0002I84EE,"This SNL best of is pretty disappointing compared to the other classic releases. I don't have anything against Walken, tho I could say he's not much more than a 1 dimensional character pausing between words longer than William Shatner impersonators do, but no, I don't hate him at all. However, this best of makes me wonder if this is really the best this guy has done on the show, or is it a collection of the only stuff he's done and not worthy of being a stand alone best of piece?

Unlike the best of John Belushi, Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Steve Martin etc.. I didn't find a single moment of this episode hilarious. I might have had a small smirk at one or two things, but really, Christopher Walkens performances on this show have honestly been nothing special. Well, that's my opinion anyway. I notice alot of people seem to love that ""More Cow Bell"" sketch for some reason, but I think it's the most overrated skit of SNL's entire run. I don't get whats supposed to be funny about it?

Honestly, to me anyway, this is probably the weakest best of SNL episode I have seen and it's not worthy of being released as a DVD special. I know some of you love him and would buy the toilet paper he wipes his rear with, but like I said, I don't hate him or have anything against him at all, but this ""best of"" was a pretty poor effort of constant nothingness.",1411430400,,1357,4.338582677165355

The actual skits are just ok. I don't know if it's just because of his dry delivery or if the skits were dry.  Maybe the audience isn't laughing because he's funny but because he's awkward.

It's an okay DVD. Not as good as Tom Hanks or Alec Baldwin's DVDs but it's a solid OK.

The Cowbell skit is his best. Missing from this DVD is when he surprised the SNL viewers with his smooth dancing and singing talents.",1379289600,,562,4.283018867924528

2098540,4,B0002I84EE,"The Cowbell skit is darn funny and included here! I sometimes wonder why it's so funny...but it IS! I attribute it mainly to Chris Walken's absolute immoveable immersion into the character of record producer deluxe. The rest of the (including a hysterical job by Will Ferrell) cast cuts loose and mugs...but Walken never falters. Brilliant! If he steps one inch out of character, the skit loses its shimmer. I' m a fan of Jimmy Fallon...but he nearly ruins the cowbell skit with upstaging and over-mugging once tickled by the goings-on. ""The Continental"" is twice visited on the DVD and there's a cool ""making of"" extra feature related to ""The Continental"" which fans will find informative and fun. Other extras include two deleted skits...one centers on Fonzie at middle age and the other is a strange take on a death angel. Both offer ""not for everyone"" dark humor...methinks both wisely cut from final production ""live"" faire. Buy this DVD for the cowbell skit....and decent other moments. Recommended. But not nearly as pristine as the Steve Martin or Chris Farley ""Best Of's"". Now THOSE are really, really great!",1372982400,,1117,5.010752688172043

2098561,4,B0002I84EE,"Thank goodness for SNL; its existence has helped showcase another side to the oddly eccentric film actor Christopher Walken. Known for years in his roles playing creeps & psychos, who would've known that Walken had a wonderful song-and-dance side to him? As luck would have it, his odd features & vocal inflections fit in perfectly with the SNL comic sensibility. During his recurring appearances as host, he has created classic sketches such as: Ed Glosser, Trivial Psychic (a hilarious sendup of his ""Dead Zone"" role); The Continental, sort of a live action version of the Pepe LePew cartoon character; a disturbing ""Pranksters"" episode; and his rendition of the song ""You Say Tomatoes"" with a giggling Jimmy Fallon. They're all here in this collection. But as usual, some key moments are missing as well; still, what's here, you'll enjoy.",1261094400,,841,5.101449275362318

But this collection should be called Randomly Chosen Chris Walken to make a quick buck for NBC, not the Best of. You'll get your money's worth, that's for sure. Christopher Walken reading a randomly chosen phone book is worth $10. But only one or two skits on here could be called his best. For starters, where was Rainbow Head? Is 1990 too long ago?

DVD Legacy now emails me back stating that they already emailed me, which was clearly a bald face lie, and said they would send a replacement item promptly.  That was over a week ago and I still have nothing once again.  Looking back on the situation, the seller had terrible feedback comments.

It doesn't have all of his best works, but it does feature a lot of his greats like ""Colonel Angus"", two episodes of ""The Continental"", the rare ""Boulevard of Broken Balls"" scene and at the very end when he was tellin Tom Hanks how it is, when Hanks was hosting SNL.  It's simply a great piece that any true Walken fan should have in his collection.",1222560000,,492,4.336956521739131

2098574,5,B0002I84EE,"There's a reason why Chris Walken has an open invitation to host SNL any time he wants - the guy is hilarious! Certainly one of America's quirkiest actors, Walken delivers comedy in his typical deadpan style. There's just something about his delivery that makes him all the funnier.

Of course this DVD contains the infamous ""more cowbell"" sketch. However, it also contains one of my all-time favorite sketches featuring Tim Meaddows taking a census from Walken: Meaddows: ""How long have you lived here?"" Walken: ""It's hard to say, what time is it?""

Also featured is the racy ""Colonel Angus"" sketch which had me in stiches.",1186963200,,624,4.933333333333334
2098575,4,B0002I84EE,"There is probably no stranger group of skits than the best skits of Christopher Walken (not all of which are on this DVD). Attention will be focused on the more popular fare -- his outings as ""The Continental"" and his skit with Mango. But the more obscure offering of Walken interviewed by a census taker stands as the oddest funny skit in memory. Walken always seems to teeter on the edge of being mistaken for a pedophile or an ax murderer. His strange cadence, shifting eyes and blank look are the perfect affect for the bizarre statements that come from his mouth, one sentence cleverly layering upon the next. And in another favorite skit, the bizarre hysteria of his band manager (""I need more cowbell"") plays well, time and time again. It is sometimes hard to explain to the uninitiated why these skits are so funny. They are funny because he does them, and he is so damn wierd.",1159574400,12,885,4.572327044025157
2098576,5,B0002I84EE,"Christoper Walken is the best SNL DVD.  almost every skit is hilarious.  The Cowbell is classic.  The other great one is the 2000 US Census with Tim Meadows.  The Centaur and Ed Glosser Trivial Psychic are also great.  His continental skits are funny to see once but never again.  The boat captain skit is great, as is the Pranksters.",1140825600,2,334,4.576271186440678

2098580,4,B0002I84EE,"Christopher Walken has hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" six times. He has given the show some of its most hilarious moments, such as the Blue Oyster Cult sketch and ""The Continental"". Thankfully, the good people at ""Saturday Night Live"" decided to give Walken his own ""best of"" dvd. It is very funny, though there a few flaws.

The majority of the sketches ont his dvd are very funny. The best sketches are the two ""Continental"" bits, ""Ed Glosser: Trivial Physcic"" (my favorite and a parody of his role in the ""The Dead Zone""), ""Hardball"", the Mango bit, Rita Del Vechio, the cowbell sketch, his monologue with Jimmy Fallon, ""Pranksters"" and the Census questioning.

The downside is there are several sketches that are not great that should have been left off. The ""Centaur Interview"" is amausing but not really funny. I liked the double-entendre in ""Colonel Angus"" but Walken doesn't appear in it until the end, and by that time the joke has run its course. The ""Lifeboat"" sketch is to absurd for his own good, and not a favorite. What I would have loved to see was Chris as Rainbow Head on ""Attitudes"" from is first episode in early 1990. And what about the first ""Continental"" sketch? It was, as one reviewer, pointed out, the best one.

The extras are surprisingly interested. The ""Fonzie"" sketch is hysterical, and the angel sketch is really entertaining as well. ""The Continental"" making off is a  very intriguing at how this seemingly complex sketch comes into being. Overall, a very enjoyable dvd. Now when will they release ""The Best Of Tom Hanks""?",1110844800,44,1553,4.805243445692884
2098581,3,B0002I84EE,"Christopher Walken is, in my opinion, one of the best hosts of SNL to grace the show. And this DVD doesn't do his appearances justice. He barely appears in the ""Colonel Angus"" skit, and the DVD extras aren't really worth looking at. It's also a let down to see so many skits cross over between the 25th anniversary edition & other ""best of"" discs. A show that's been on so long should put a little more into their realeases.

All let-downs aside, there are hilarious moments in the Walken DVD that are worth watching. The ""Captain of the Boat"" was a favorite when I first saw it and I'm glad to see it here.",1098576000,15,607,4.324561403508772
