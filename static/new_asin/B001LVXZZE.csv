8319925,5,B001LVXZZE,"Strange post-production, but I can see why it was done that way. The performer appears to be standing still, which makes copying/learning the movements easier. After all, once you no longer need the video, it doesn't matter what it looks like. That being said, the form itself is not for beginners. It will take you many hours to learn the material and even longer to get comfortable with it, so it's a great value for the price, if you know how to learn from video. The applications are not shown, which is fine for a more advanced form. If you are merely a collector, this is still a great DVD. We're all a bit lucky that this footage has been preserved.",1456617600,,656,4.429752066115703
