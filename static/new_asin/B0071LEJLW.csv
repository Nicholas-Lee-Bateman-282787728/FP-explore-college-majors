5047449,4,B0071LEJLW,"The dysfunctional-family-holiday-reunion movie has been done many times.  The Gathering, The Family Stone, and Home for the Holidays come to mind.  Here is an entry from across the pond.

In this case, there is a bit of a twist:  Dad is reluctant to gather his children together.  They don't get along.  He doesn't seem to like them much.  (Don't worry, he's only pretending.)  Grandma (Honor Blackman, who has aged beautifully from her James Bond days) wants the grand- and great-grandkids together for Pesach.  Lenny, the dutiful son, hunts them down from all corners of the globe and persuades them to come back to the family estate.  They have headed in different directions spiritually as well as literally.  Eldest son Danny is a ruthless venture capitalist with an adorable and rather neglected son Jake.  Daughter Andie is an ecological activist in South Africa.  Son Yona is a rabbi with a lovely wife, two daughters and another child on the way.  Son Nick is a Buddhist.  When these four offspring get together, they are capable of spectacular blowups with lots of residual damage to furniture and each other's feelings.

The movie usually takes a farcical tone, but it is strongly anchored by Timothy Spall's nuanced, compassionate performance as Lenny.  It ends up being a strong and moving statement on the nature of parent/child relations.  Lenny would never deny his mother what turns out to be her dying wish.  All of his adult children are strong-willed in their own ways and clearly will not come home unless they want to (and definitely will not play nice in any event).  The younger generation is represented most prominently by Jake (Theo Stevenson, a very touching performance) who just wants his dad to spend some time with him.  There is the necessary and formulaic plot development at the end that allows everyone to come together as a family and leaves the viewer with misty eyes.

This is a 4-star movie for me.  The physical humor was too broad for my taste.  However, the movie is definitely worth watching for Timothy Spall's performance.",1379030400,6,2068,4.910404624277457
5047450,5,B0071LEJLW,"If you only know Timothy Spall from the Harry Potter films, you don't realize what a great comic actor he is! And if you even wondered what happened to ""Pussy Galore"" (Honor Blackman) from ""Goldfinger"", she's also a part of this terrific film. The cast will have your laughing, shedding a few tears and thinking of your own family, more than likely! I heartily recommend ""Reuniting the Rubins"" for teen and adult audiences.",1332374400,3,423,4.808219178082192
5047461,5,B0071LEJLW,"There are some light and humorous moments but this is a powerful story about family values, raising siblings, their values and how they all reach peace. Very good movie but I wouldn't have it categorized as a comedy.",1484438400,,216,4.7105263157894735

5047464,1,B0071LEJLW,I kept thinking this movie would improve or have a point. It didn't.,1483920000,,68,4.3076923076923075

5047484,2,B0071LEJLW,"The only reason I watched until the end was because I am sick and didn't want to get up.  I did not find it to be particularly entertaining and the characters were, for the most part obnoxious.",1483315200,,193,4.216216216216216

5047490,4,B0071LEJLW,"Very enjoyable, funny where it needs to be, but also sweet.  You do end up caring about the characters.  Good dialogue and plot, nice acting, good comedic timing.  Four stars means it was not perfect, but then, movies rarely are.  We both liked this  movie a lot.",1481846400,,263,4.51063829787234
5047491,2,B0071LEJLW,Broad stereotypes and a silly story do not make for good movie viewing.,1481846400,,71,4.538461538461538

5047506,5,B0071LEJLW,"Awe I loved this! I originally watched it for Rhona Mitra, but I think I would have liked it even if she wasn't in it, but it did help! The whole cast was wonderful, not your usual feuding family get together movies! It made me laugh in some parts, and made me cry in others, and ended with me feeling good! If you don't like family drama's then don't watch it, there are no gory scenes, car chases or nude scenes either, it's just something to make you think about your priorities bit!",1474761600,,486,4.236559139784946
5047507,1,B0071LEJLW,After a few minutes...I turned it off.  Just didn't do it for me...,1473984000,,67,4.153846153846154

5047510,3,B0071LEJLW,"It took me a minute to get into the movie. I recognized the main actor and then placed him in Harry Potter.

It was funny, a little sad, a little odd but I stayed watching and actually enjoyed the movie.",1463961600,,203,4.075

5047533,5,B0071LEJLW,"Liked the movie a lot, and thought about it afterwards, which means it affected me. It's bitter-sweet and has an optimistic ending.",1463356800,,131,5.0
5047534,4,B0071LEJLW,Not a bad little movie. I think that it's strongest quality was the characters. On the surface they were all very different. But as the story progressed and we got to know them better they were all very much alike. I liked how I could see the world through each of their eyes. It made sense that they would be in conflict over superficial issues and they would be united for important issues. The humor was very light and didn't come at anyone's expense... it was directed at the human condition or human behavior... it wasn't hurtful or spiteful. I will have to admit that it did get a little sappy at the end. But I think that the sucrose ending is a minor sin... If you like this type of movie than I think that you would be entertained by this one.,1461974400,,752,4.265734265734266

5047590,4,B0071LEJLW,"I liked the cast, Spall is always enjoyable to watch...typical dysfunctional family chaos ensues, nothing new there, but it was an enjoyable film",1444176000,,145,5.3478260869565215
5047591,2,B0071LEJLW,"I couldn't relate to the excessive family dysfunction.  All families tend to have some degree of dysfunction, no one is perfect, but this went wayyyy overboard.  Of course this is based solely on my personal experience.  This much family discord probably exists more then I am aware.  SPOILER ALERT

 I did like how they came together for the birth.  Also, the way the money grubbing brother called off an operation his company was about to execute when he discovered his sister had a child in the area.",1439078400,,503,4.712643678160919
5047592,5,B0071LEJLW,Lots of interesting things here. It was a movie with family values and morals and religion while also showing family feuds.,1438300800,,123,4.904761904761905
5047593,3,B0071LEJLW,Sibling rivalry rules in this farce about a Jewish family and the grandmother's wish to reunite her grandchildren for Sader. The back story as to how they ended up so different from one another could have been more developed. Happy ending though.,1437436800,,246,4.880952380952381

5047597,3,B0071LEJLW,"Yes, this film is funny, but it does try a little too hard to isolate and pluck as many heart strings as possible.

Just about every conceivable contention, circumstance, and variable is thrown into this mix of family truce and reconciliation; and while it does work on some rather shallow level, I doubt it will make many lasting impressions. Cute and agreeable would sum it up nicely.",1430352000,,386,4.7611940298507465
5047598,3,B0071LEJLW,Can't really talk about movie.  I conked out!  The movie wasn't the cause of my nap.  I was just sleepy.,1398902400,,104,4.1
8508377,4,B0071LEJLW,We really enjoyed Reuniting the Rubins - kept us laughing throughout! We found we could relate to so much of the family drama...wonderful cast of characters and good acting also helped to make this a most enjoyable film!,1527379200,,220,4.815789473684211
8508378,4,B0071LEJLW,"nice movie, guess it shows families matter in ways we don't expect. It was fun to watch",1501545600,,87,4.176470588235294
8508379,1,B0071LEJLW,"Horrifically cliched, predictable, and idiotic to the end.",1500163200,,58,6.375
8508380,5,B0071LEJLW,"It's a rare jewel that follows the plot, combining not only family relations, generations relations, but manages to be all inclusive religiously, with the warm spence of humor, great characters, and without pouring the nauseating sweetness of being politically correct.",1493596800,,269,5.75
8508381,2,B0071LEJLW,There was nothing about this film I enjoyed.  Not my cup of tea in the humor dept.,1493078400,,82,3.823529411764706
8508382,5,B0071LEJLW,"Entertaining. Surprising plot line. Pleasant ending. Many insightful moments. Casting and performance brings life and depth to a kind of joke. Like my own dis-united, peripatetic family. I identified with them and saw my relationship with people I'm related to in these characters, including the numbers tattooed on granny's forearm and so on. Excellent presentation of a modern traditional Seder. The story has conservative religious values but it's very well-told with many scenes that teeter on perfection.",1489276800,,509,5.623376623376624
