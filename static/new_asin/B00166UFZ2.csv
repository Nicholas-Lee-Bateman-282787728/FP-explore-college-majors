8261176,1,B00166UFZ2,"Great story, my whole family LOVED the series. For Christmas a few years ago I bought at Best Buy for myself, my sister, and my mother- SO excited! Turned into SO embarrassed when my own mother called to say it was all chopped up. GRRRR;/ Super short version that doesn't even make sense. WHY???? I got my sisters copy back and never opened mine. So sad. Yes I should have read the number of minutes but who does that(?)- I do now. And somewhere on the packaging should have said in BIG BOLD letters ""Edited.....NOT THE ENTIRE VERSION, NOT EVEN CLOSE.""",1340064000,,552,4.475247524752476

8261178,3,B00166UFZ2,"Well, after reviewing several reviews, I must agree with the fact that yes, this is a quite an edited version of the novela. I found it at my local library and picked up to watch and sure enough, I was very disappointed with the chopping of the series. It totally skips crucial pieces of the story! Like when Diego is telling Paloma that he is leaving to London and will return in a years time. Well, if you don't mind missing out on the whole story and don't really know it all, then maybe this series is for you, otherwise, I would just rent it at the local dvd store or library.",1290902400,,581,4.196428571428571
8261179,3,B00166UFZ2,"I saw this novela back in 2001-2002. I missed the first month and a half. I started watching it and got hooked immediately. The performances by Silvia Navarro and Sergio Basanez were so passionate! Unfortunately here with this DVD we're getting a super heavily edited version of this wonderful novela. The novela lasted for about a year and here they want to cram into eight hours. You watch one story line and it doesn't even finish before you're in the middle of another one. The good thing is that they left in the original music, not like some of Televisa's DVDs that have have some cheap, horrible background music. I wish that someone in charge at TV Azteca, Televisa and Telemundo's home video would listen to the fans of these wonderful novelas and release the complete, unedited novelas with all the original music. I'm giving this DVD 3 stars because of the wonderful memories that this passionate story brings me and because they had the original music in it as well.",1264118400,,978,4.7251461988304095
8261180,1,B00166UFZ2,"Just one word: disapointed.  They cut so many important part of the story.  I saw this production in TV and is very good, but the DVD kill the drama because is like a summary but a very bad summary.",1219881600,4,198,4.051282051282051
8261181,1,B00166UFZ2,"I watched the whole series 5 yrs ago & i loved it. I ordered this dvd for my
collection but got disappointed when i found out no English subtitles available.",1219622400,16,157,4.266666666666667
8261182,1,B00166UFZ2,"The novela Cuando seas Mia on sale at Amazon, is a condensed version. Don't waste your money. The Unabriged version, by TV Azteca, is a grate production, and I Hope some day, it goes on sale. Who ever thougth it was agood deal to put on sale an ""abriged version"" of it, Is a compleate scam.
I've seen most of the original novela, TV Azteca has put on tv for about three times already, unfortunately, I had never been able to see it in it's whole. Lets hope somebody brigthens up and come up with the entire version of Cuando Seas Mia, and I mean chapter by chapter, even if we have to pay a little bit more. Again, this condensed version is a complete disapoinment, almost half of the chapters are missing, and those who buy it will not get whats going on, especially those like me who have seen the ""real good Stuf""",1217894400,13,816,4.2709677419354835
