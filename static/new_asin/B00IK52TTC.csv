8642842,5,B00IK52TTC,"It's a pity that Alec McCowen's (19252017) name and work are less recognizable in the U.S. than in the U.K. He was regarded as one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his generation. If remembered it all In popular cinema, it's probably for his performances as Inspector Oxford in Hitchcock's ""Frenzy"" and as Q in Sean Connery's return to the screen as Bond in ""Never Say Never Again."" All this is preamble for the performance recorded on this disc, which is a special tour de force. It's not what one normally thinks of in those terms: big, loud, boisterous, Instead, McCowen's ""Mark"" is a feat of memory, restraint, and exuberance. Filmed in 1979 at the Lamb's Theater in New York, in a performance nominated for a Tony, McCowen simply strolls onstage in a casual sweater, with no props other than a table, four chairs, a cup and a pitcher of water, and enacts Mark's Gospel, from memory: one hour and 43 minutes, with one intermission. (He dedicated sixteen months to memorization, rehearsals, and try-outs.) This is no dry recital. It is most certainly not a droning homily. Neither, however, is it glammed up, and it's at the farthest remove from ham you could imagine. As an actor the attitude he adopts is something like, ""I want you to know the most amazing story I've ever heardand here it is."" As one would expect of a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he uses his voice as a virtuoso instrument, always with intelligence. His elocution is impeccable; the delivery, nearly breathless but intelligently modulated; his Kentish dialect, immediately accessible to American ears. He traverses the stage, but never as a peacock: his movements and gestures are economical, precisely fitting the narration. The three-camera work is expertly directed; the lighting and visual design support the story's many moods but never draws attention to themselves.

McCowen uses this King James Version of 1611, but do not allow that to put you off. As with contemporaneous Shakespearean plays, so here: a classically trained actor like McCowen can crawl under the skin of slightly antique English and is able to communicate to today's audience just what they need to know to get the point. This disc was produced using analog video-taped elements: the clarity of the image will not meet HD1080 standards, but it is quite clear enough. Had you and I been seated in good seats at the Lamb's Theater 35 years ago, we would not have seen anything much more sharply than we have here. In fact, our experience is better, because the director and actor have made careful decisions when to shift from full to medium shots, then to close-ups, and back again.

I regularly teach a course on the Gospel of Mark. For the past twenty years I have introduced every course by showing my young students this film. I cannot remember an occasion when they were not mesmerized by it. I've now seen it well over thirty times and still find it gripping. I am delighted that Daystar has now transferred to DVD and made available at a reasonable price a performance I could show only on a VHS tape that is now in magnetic tatters (assuming I can find a VHS player). Whether you are religious or not, this is a performance for the ages. Among solo vocal performances of any text, McCowen's ""Mark"" is the closest thing I know to watching Astaire and Rogers dance: they make it look so easy, so spontaneous, so elegant. Behind their performances are years of practice, discipline, and good taste. What they all deliver is joy.",1508284800,5,3501,4.7947019867549665
8642843,5,B00IK52TTC,"I was lucky enough, decades ago, to see one of Alec McCowen's performances of ""St Mark's Gospel."" Although the sound quality of this video is not ideal, the disk does capture his wealth of insights into this most direct and unvarnished of the gospels, and his total lack of pretension. I wish readings of this sort were more common -- just the original words, but with a sympathetic yet never over-the-top actor's voice. On TV, these would make great Christmas and Easter viewing.",1490832000,,480,4.795180722891566
8642844,5,B00IK52TTC,"...it's sad to see his obituaries emphasize his one-off performance as ""Q"" in Sean Connery's final James Bond film. This venerable stage actor should instead be remembered for this performance if no other.

This is no mere Sunday morning recitation. Just imagine being TOLD the entirety of a Gospel. No teleprompter, no staging or scenery, no histrionics, paraphrasing or improvisation, a man, a table with chairs, a pitcher of water and glass set upon the table, and an audience sitting in the dark.

He wrote a book on the experience, ""Personal Mark"", which I recommend as well.

And, my goodness, he committed an entire Gospel to memory. Try that sometime.",1486771200,,659,4.972727272727273

8642846,5,B00IK52TTC,"A fine performance caught live on stage. Just for the record,  he did not need to consult his little book of St. Mark. Bravura performance.",1470441600,,139,4.56
8642847,3,B00IK52TTC,"Be sure to note that this is KJV, not NKJV, but in archiac English of ""sayeth,"" ""thee,"" ""thou."" If you return it within days of receipt after noticing the language usage, Amazon will keep $ 10. Instead I purchased Max McLean's St. Mark's Gospel in NIV. Performance is great and easier to listen to for American audience.

I have heard Alec McCowen in a very fine performance where he does not use KJV.",1458691200,,401,4.493150684931507

8642849,5,B00IK52TTC,"A masterly performance by a splendid actor.  The recording itself is now quite old--it was made in 1977!--and there have been other performances of Mark recorded more recently with, inevitably, better technical quality simply as recordings.  If you are willing to get past that, however, this remains far and away the best actual performance of Mark available on record, by far and away the most accomplished actor.",1446508800,2,415,5.17910447761194
8642850,5,B00IK52TTC,This performance is quite amazing.  A beautifully inspired presentation of the Gospel of Mark in a simple setting that lifts the viewer/listener right into the higher meaning and impact of the gospel stories.  The King James Bible comes to life with Mr. McCowen's memorable interpretation.  Uplifting and unforgettable.,1403827200,5,319,5.604166666666667
8642851,5,B00IK52TTC,"Alec McCowen's accomplishment is truly a masterpiece of oration and inflection. He memorized the entire Gospel! His ability to bring out the drama and tenderness of this wonderful Gospel is touching, inspiring and amazingly relevant for today. Everyone should own and watch this.",1403568000,5,279,5.511627906976744
