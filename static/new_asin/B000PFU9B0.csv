Particularly fabulous is the solo by Dave DiCenso! I watch this repeatedly! It is one of the most beautiful drum solos ever recorded! Musicality, dynamics, technique ,emotion---it's got it all! Fantastic!!

Then, there is the fabulous Steve Smith's Jazz Legacy! Wow!

Danny Seraphine back at it with CTA! Bobby Sanabria and Mike Mangini too!

The only down side of this is Brann Dailor! Ugh!",1386806400,,438,5.041666666666667
