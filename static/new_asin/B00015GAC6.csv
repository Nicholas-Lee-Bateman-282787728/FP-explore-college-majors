The ECW material can be found (oddly in slightly better quality) in ""ECW - The Best Of Cactus Jack"" DVD. I'm glad they showed the second Sabu/Cactus match (missing on the ECW dvd). You do need both dvds to get a more complete collection of Mick Foley. All that is missing is his FMW matches and the famous IWA King Of The Deathmatch Tournament (not available on dvd sadly). On a personal note, I do admit getting annoyed on seeing the old ""WWF"" logo being blurred, and during the Hell In The Cell match, part of the J.R./Lawler commentary is slightly edited (seems they can't mention that the thumbtacks are in his flesh).",1079913600,,785,4.574468085106383
