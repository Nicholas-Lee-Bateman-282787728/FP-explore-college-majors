8504830,5,B006UUXZTC,"As an Eden Energy Medicine Certified Practitioner (EEM-CP), I have found Energy Fluency to be incredibly helpful because it organizes my wealth of EEM materials as well as all the great techniques, assessments, corrections and exercises Ellen teaches into four manageable categories!

These four categories are based on whether energy practices  (1) help identify whether the body's energies are moving the way they're designed to move (2) help maintain the body's sanctity, protections and ability to communicate internally and externally (3) help the body receive and metabolize the energy it needs or (4) help shift energy habits towards a healthier ""new normal.""

While some learners are able to construct a framework or big picture from many pieces of information, others of us (like me) need to be given a framework or big picture first so we have a way to manage and organize all the pieces.  I wish I had had such a framework from the beginning of my EEM studies.  Thank you, Ellen!",1365292800,3,990,5.012195121951219
