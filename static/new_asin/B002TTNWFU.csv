8380628,1,B002TTNWFU,"My rating does not apply to the story/movie ""Against a Crooked Sky"".  How you rate the story/movie is subjective to you.  Personally, I've always felt it was a great family movie.  However, the movie mastered to this DVD edition is absolutely awful.  It's so poorly done that it is unwatchable.  It looks like a bad, smeary vhs copy.  Picture is dull and lacks detail and sharpness.  I tried to watch for a few minutes but ended up tossing this into the trash.  I may try again with a different DVD from another DVD mastering company.",1290556800,6,534,4.5473684210526315
