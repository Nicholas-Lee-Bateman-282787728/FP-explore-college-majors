5423268,5,B00AFENF62,"The Watchers 1-5 Series packs a lot of information of different 'conspiracy' theory-type topics on each DVD.  The interviews are very interesting.  It goes so fast, I need to watch them all again.  I really like LA Marzulli as he seems genuine.  It really shows that all of the collaborators have worked hard digging up details of the subject matter.  Really great effort!  I wish for more details but I don't know if any more exist or could be told in this format.  Truly, I find some of the information hard to believe in full - it's almost too much at times - but maybe it's because if the evidence and theories behind them ARE really true, some are too horrifying to imagine.  I do believe many people have thought, throughout the ages, that they were 'living in the last days' and relative to human history, we may be; however, if we will or won't witness the return of the Nephilim and/or Antichrist in our lifetime is anyone's guess - but the thought that WE POSSIBLY COULD truly scares the heck out of me.  I hope God will bless this work to further convince people to turn away from sin; to believe that Jesus Christ really came as God in the flesh.  ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that who so ever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God sent His son to the world not to condemn it, but to save it"" - John 3:16,17
I pray the believers can be taken away with Christ from this crazy world before the judgment comes, as the book of Revelation predicts.  The Watchers does it's part to paint a portrait of sorts of what the apocalypse might involve, in our everyday terms.  Even if you are not a Christian, I believe you will find it interesting and believable.",1372723200,13,1726,4.3730407523510975
5423269,5,B00AFENF62,I had rented and watched the movies on Amazon and had seen several interviews with L A Marzulli.  I wanted to learn more about his theories and I was not disappointed.  His movies were very interesting and informative.  They gave me a lot to think about.,1362441600,14,254,4.478260869565218
8550844,5,B00AFENF62,"I purchased my 5 part DVD series from L.A. himself while he was visiting the Church I attend here in a suburb of Los Angeles something like five or six years ago.  I can attest that mine did in fact come packaged in a nice box which Mr. Marzulli kindly autographed for me.  As far as the content goes if this isn't your bag then you may not understand or relate to it.  I however can relate to it as I have seen first hand the Black Triangles fly slowly, silently directly over my house before they dowsed their front light and sped off at an incredible speeds (all without sound or visible signs of exhaust).

Of course, my family is no stranger to the UFO or the ""Alien"" abduction sleep paralysis phenomenon.  (I was taken to a shrink when I was a child because I kept having nightmare abduction experiences where a whirring vortex like sound would occur and suddenly I'd be surrounded by monsters, speaking a language I didn't understand who would carry me off into the night, awake but unable to move.  It wasn't until I was 13 and accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior that these horrific episodes finally stopped).  Interestingly enough, my father also had strange encounters during his youth where an orange orb of light would come into his bedroom at night and hover close to his face, directly between his eyes.

Any way, I am grateful for people such as L.A. Marzulli, for taking the time and putting forth the effort to bring us information that serves to reaffirm all of this to those who have experienced such things and educate those who have not.  I thank God for my UFO experiences in life, allowing me to see what's on the other side of the veil, albeit briefly and perhaps a bit frightening.  And I thank God for people such as L.A. Marzulli, tirelessly working to keep us abreast of the latest events.  Thanks God!  (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens)",1522454400,,1902,4.513119533527697
8550845,5,B00AFENF62,"We have been following this series for many years and everything given is documented with facts.  It is an eye-opener as many of the things discussed have not been brought forth by the media, and if it is, there are ""holes"" in their reports.  Our friends have all borrowed our series and feel this is an open door to information being overlooked by the scientific community or if at best, ignored do to the ramifications if they acknowledge it.  The music in the background could be toned down a bit but it doesn't take away from the facts presented.",1417478400,,550,4.5353535353535355
8550846,5,B00AFENF62,Interesting research.,1412035200,,21,10.0
8550847,5,B00AFENF62,The package arrived quickly! And the anticipation was worth the wait.,1409097600,,69,5.363636363636363
8550848,4,B00AFENF62,"The first two DVD's are rather boring but I wanted to start at the beginning so I ordered the set then ordered the other two seperate. DVD #3 starts getting interesting #4 is even better and the interview with Howard Storm is fascinating....it will send chills down your spine. There IS life after death and while we are still alive WE get to choose where we will spend eternity. The moment you die and step off of this planet and into eternity IT IS TOO LATE for a decision then. #5 is even better (the DVD's get progressively better) as the children with the black eyes is bone chilling. #6 is interesting....#7 we are back to UFO's...but it's good. Can't wait for #8 to come out. The ONLY problem I have with them is, again, the background music. It's so loud and very annoying. WHEN will people who make these films quit with the music already!!!!",1408147200,2,851,4.461538461538462
8550849,5,B00AFENF62,"I can't wait to get six and seven!  Time passes so quickly when I watch these documentary interviews from a Christian viewpoint.  I was so engaged and encouraged to know that others out there are encountering things that go beyond the normal, everyday experiences.  I believe these honestly and thoroughly made.  I only wished the dvds were 2 hours instead of a little over one each, but I understand the time and expense devoted to each one.  Nevertheless, I really felt it was worth the investment.  Also, it is a great way to share things with those who are open minded or have had unique experiences.  People need answers like this.
Well done~  God bless you, brother Marzulli!!!",1394668800,2,683,4.728813559322034
8550850,5,B00AFENF62,I watch and keep watching this.  I find this interesting and instructive and it makes me think of things that I never noticed or would ever have thought of before.  Im also glad that there are records of such things written down but mostly from the Bible and Im glad that Marzulli is a christian,1392940800,,295,4.345454545454546
8550851,5,B00AFENF62,"SOOO!!!! Interesting, my kids and I watched one every week and we looked forward to watching them. The one thing I have to say because I am hard hearing is the music in the background was hard to hear someone talking, I had to keep going back to see if I could hear it or one of my kids sometimes could tell other then that it's great and I would recommend it.",1385337600,,360,4.013888888888889
8550852,4,B00AFENF62,"I really like the DVDs, but I want to know more.
PROS: LA gives a lot of thought provoking information in these DVDs.  I think he should have gone into a lot more detail on some things and have told him so in personal e-mails but what he does do is present a little bit about a lot of topics.  Okay, here's my thing... I'm not a conspiracy fanatic but the information presented in these DVDs, well simply stated, everyone ought to hear this stuff.  This is the 101 course to the supernatural.  What is supernatural, simple, if it's not occurring naturally then it is supernatural.  LA does for example say there are no UFOs, it's not a matter of whether they are there or not, it is a matter of who is behind (or inside) them.  Why the cattle mutilations?  Certainly they are happening - whose behind them and why?  Why have all the national museums (pretty much worldwide) taken certain displays out of public view, example is possible bones of giant humanoid figures?  Who would want these taken off display and why?
CONS: they are too expensive.  Should be half the price you have to pay for them, but maybe the profits fund further studies of these subjects.  There needs to be more about any given subject than is presented.  It's just enough to make you interested but not really enough to satisfy any of the topics - I WANT TO KNOW MORE! In one place on the first DVD the chapter heading says ""What does the Supernatural Guidebook have to say about..... ""  LA says that the supernatural guidebook is rife with examples of this and that but never does tell us what the supernatural guide book says about the subject.  He walks all around it but never does say what it says about the subject.  I want to know more about what is really going on out at ECETI Ranch and there is 2 or 3 minutes about it but not realy enough to tell you much.  One woman says fairies are real and she describes two or three of them a little bit and she says they are malicious - but that's about it.

Bottom line though is he's on to something and you need to know about it.  Look LA marzuli up on you tube and see some of those files and listen to his radio interviews first before you buy these DVDs to know whether you want to out-lay this kind of money on 5 to 6 hours of video.",1383868800,4,2266,4.2669789227166275
8550853,3,B00AFENF62,"The picture shown in advertisement for this product shows (and also states) as a boxset. What we received was 5 DVDs packaged together in plastic wrap taped shut. As far as the DVDs go, we're pleased. LA Marzulli is amazing and the information is eye opening.
 I would suggest a change in the picture unless you'll actually be sending it AS A BOXSET.",1382745600,10,350,4.555555555555555
