4258235,5,B0043WC6PS,These math dvd's are exactly what we needed to help us end the struggles of homework for my 9 year old grandchild. They are clear and simple to understand.  I love that with ease I can stop and proceed to watch and go back to redo any part that we may need to repeat. We have showed all our friends and they now want to borrow from us to help their children.,1394841600,,358,3.9722222222222223
4258236,3,B0043WC6PS,Not really anything new. My son didn't really feel like he learned anything. I think this DVD isn't as good as the other MathTutorDVD.com DVD's. If you are looking for a challenge- LOOK ELSEWHERE!!!,1393372800,,198,4.852941176470588
4258237,5,B0043WC6PS,"This is a video of a  dude with a whiteboard and dry erase marker. But it's awesome. I use the 1st-7th grade DVD for my 4 and 6 year old and use this one to supplement it.  Of course some math secrets are more advanced but others are great for establishing and understanding number sense.  Bravo, cheapest video to make but definitely a valuable asset as an educational tool.",1377216000,,375,4.405797101449275
4258238,5,B0043WC6PS,"Am Disabled Veteran with Traumatic Brain Injury.  Because I have no short term memory, trying to do simple calculations in my head was not possible when more than one colum of figures was involved.  Remembering a remainder or previous column total from one column while while calculating the next column I can not do (anything involving multitasking is hard if not impossible).  Using some of the stratigies taught in these lessons to perform basic calculations in my head helps me to calculate change and perform other basic on-the-spot calculations...a basic skill that I had lost...The way that some of these math methods are taught the calculations are preformed in one straight line of thought so there is nothing but one progressive amount to remember. These lessons teach how to calculate without remainders or other clutter to retain durning the process I can now do some basic and necessary (life-skills) calculating at an almost normal pace.  Would recommend this course for anyone, especially young children with attention problems, stroke victims, TBI victims or anyone who has trouble with multi-tasking (I only wish I had learned this stuff when I was a kid, these methods make math much easier to understand).  I am sure that these tips will improve ANYONE's calculathing speed. And...increase the self-esteem of the young or old who struggle with math by helping them to learn new short-cuts that others do not know --- AND EVERYBODY SHOULD.  Why don't they teach this stuff in school? LUCK TO ALL ... EVERY ELEMENTRY SCHOOL TEACHER SHOULD GET THIS DVD !!",1373500800,10,1571,5.046332046332046
4258239,5,B0043WC6PS,"I got this because I was curious, and because I hoped it would add to the shortcuts we have already learned in our homeschool.  It does have some interesting and time saving shortcuts and information.",1360368000,2,200,4.714285714285714
4258240,5,B0043WC6PS,this is a very educational dvd. this is good not only for young children. even older people will learn and enjoy from this video. you must get yours now.,1341014400,,153,4.310344827586207
4258241,5,B0043WC6PS,"I have bought many products from the Math Tutor for the Mrs., as she often has to teach herself advanced mathematical concepts at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She always understands better and makes straight A's when she applies herself after using these programs for supplement and/or self-teaching. I bought a book on mental math, and it made several things easier for me. This program just added to it, and it makes it easier for the kids as well. I highly recommend this and all the other programs I have bought from the Math Tutor, and I hope he'll have more of the ones I'll want in the future.",1340236800,4,611,4.513513513513513
4258242,5,B0043WC6PS,"I am 44 years old and I'm having to go back to school to pass some calculus classes to basically keep my defense engineering job (the government is really getting strict and demanding on the computer scientists and engineers it will hire).  The big problem is I never went beyond College Algebra 1 and 2, and that was over 10 years ago, and due to lack of use, I've pretty much forgot it all again.  Back in high school, I passed standard algebra with fairly average grades at best, and was never exposed to trig at all.  So you can color me desperate for a ""crash course"" solution to basically getting not only calculus in my head so I can pass a few classes to keep my job, but also provide a total review of even some basic math skills I've forgotten.  I have forgotten pretty much all of algebra as well due to lack of use, and I have never been exposed to trig, a prerequisite of learning Calculus.

In short, I basically have to learn it ALL.  And FAST.

I  bought a few of these DVDs (featuring Jason Gibson) because of all the high reviews on Amazon.  WOW!  Worth every penny.  The first disc I popped in was the 1st-7th Grade Math DVD.  Jason Gibson's teaching style alone actually attracted my kids into the TV room.  All 3 of them (aged 6 to 14) all eventually wound up sitting next to me and watching the DVD with me!  It immediately solved several different areas that my kids were struggling with that I didn't even know they were having problems with (Egad, bad Dad!).  I was impressed both by the way Jason Gibson instructs (my kids like him, which says it all) and the way he repeats each lesson multiple times to make sure you ""get it"" before moving on to the next lesson/topic.  TOTALLY perfect for me, because I really need my hand held like a little kid as I crash my way from basic mathematics up through algebra, trig, and calc.  Embarrassing to admit all of this, but hey, math is really tough for most of us, and that's if we didn't forget it altogether since high school or college.

I do not have thousands and thousands of dollars in my pocket for prerequisite/catch-up pre-calc college courses or personal tutors in prep for my calculus classes.  I'm lucky to get a tax return.  What I DID do, however, especially after seeing the immediate results with my kids, is I bought the whole entire ""Math Tutor"" DVD set (making sure Jason Gibson is the instructor), I think I paid about $250-300 here on Amazon for all of them combined.  They are now a large ""Math Tutor Library"" sitting in my TV room that both myself and the kids can access at any time for any cramming or homework assistance we may need.

This DVD set is a total jackpot, exactly what I needed, and also acts as the perfect ""good grade insurance"" for my kids.  As a Dad, I feel I've helped my kids with their homework in the best possible way I possibly could have - I have basically brought into my home a friendly, permanent, personal, likeable, 24/7-available, Ph. D-level Math Tutor of the highest caliber for my kids who covers nearly every single topic of mathematics that my kids will experience in their studies and in real life.  This includes college-level instruction.

I could not be any happier with this purchase, so much so that I bought ALL of these Math Tutor DVDs just so I could have the entire set and cover every base no matter what classes my or any of my kids will ever take.

Looking forward to coming back in a year or so after I take my own classes to post the results of using these DVDs to basically save my butt, job, and family's well-being).  I have already been thoroughly enjoying the wonderful results they have produced in my kids' math grades at school, so buy with confidence.  These DVDs are excellent, both in ""damage control"" for bad grades and ""good grade insurance"" for you or your kids.",1330992000,27,3821,4.427753934191703
4258243,5,B0043WC6PS,"This has ""math tips"" that will help everyone. I wish that I had know about this when I was in public school.

8415362,5,B0043WC6PS,"Best tutoring purchase ever! Our minds were blown by how simply these concepts were broken down to a near ""duh"" level. It never occurs to you to see math this way until you're shown a new route. This has had a positive impact on our boy's math skills, and ours. We're going to end up buying the entire series because there's no doubt that these techniques work.",1490832000,,361,4.402985074626866
