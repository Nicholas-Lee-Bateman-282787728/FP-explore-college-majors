2664119,5,B000IVQALO,"The ideal beginners step aerobics dvd! Cathe is wonderful at cueing each move and moves at a steady pace while teaching you all the basics.  I have been doing this dvd for over two months now and have built up to the second riser.  I have advanced to intermediate level but this still gets me sweating and the bonus stability ball abs workout is wonderful to do after the step workout.  I really appreciate that I can break up the workout into different sections since it gives me a water break in between each combination.  She is wonderful at cueing and an instructor you can appreciate rather then despise, lol.",1247702400,,614,4.554545454545455
2664120,4,B000IVQALO,"This workout is really good for people that are begginers with the step. For me, after a month I need something more challenging. But it was definately a good choice, since I haven't make execersice for several years. If your're starting with the step, this is a really workout for you, but if you're familiar with it, you'll get bore after a few weeks.",1236729600,2,353,4.53125
2664121,5,B000IVQALO,"I have been doing step for a number of years now and yet I love this dvd!
It is beginning step so she is very clear on the moves in the routine, calls them out early giving you plenty of time to plan ahead for them. The steps are basic, but they are arranged in a way to give you a great work out.  She does alot of repetition giving you plenty of time to catch on to the routine the first time through.

I have been doing step for many years now and enjoy the harder routines, but I love this dvd when I want to pop something in and just work out without having to concentrate so much on footwork or patterns.  To make this dvd more challenging I use all the steps, throw on a couple of hand weights, and add jumps to all the stepping.

I highly recommend this dvd to any beginner or intermediate stepper!",1225756800,3,806,4.01875
2664122,5,B000IVQALO,"This is a great 30-minute cardio step workout with Cathe Friedrich.  The moves are not as complicated as some of her workouts and the fact that it is only 30 minutes works well for someone who does not have a lot of time each day to exercise.

The 10-minute stability ball workout is GREAT also.  It can be done with or without the stability ball as the DVD shows.

The other comments on Amazon about this workout were helpful in my decision to purchase this as well.",1223337600,4,467,4.333333333333333
2664123,5,B000IVQALO,"I really like this video for beginner to intermediate.  Beginners, don't worry everyone gets confused at first! Trust me, I started step at a gym where everyone knew how and was uniform, I just stood there feeling like a fool when I realized step was more complicated than I had thought.  This DVD at home is perfect! Just don't give up. My favorite part is there is not extra mumbo jumbo dance moves.  If I wanted to dance, Id dance.  I wanted a step dvd and that is what I got. Works up a good sweat, good cardio, and her cues are very good.  Would definitely recommend.",1220400000,3,572,4.308411214953271
2664124,5,B000IVQALO,"This DVD came with the Step I purchased.  I have NEVER done Step aerobics before and I really enjoyed this workout.  It is very basic, but that is what I needed.  Some of the steps were difficult to master at first, especially since I have 2 left feet.  But when I got confused I would just rewind and try it until I got it.  It's a great DVD to start stepping or to get back in it after you haven't done it in a while.  This was also my first Cathe Friedrich DVD and I really liked her teaching style.  I will definitely be purchasing more of her workouts.",1219622400,3,557,4.055045871559633
2664125,4,B000IVQALO,"This is a difficult review to write - not because of the product or the content, but because I am probably one of very few MALE owners of this instructional DVD.

That being said, I first became familiar with Step exercise many years ago while in high school.  I did Step aerobics during the summer to prepare myself for high school band practice in Augusta, Georgia with 105-degree heat indexes on a black-top parking lot.  People zonked out from heat exhaustion every day.  But not me.

I exercised then as preparation.  I exercise now as a result - result of getting older, lower metabolism, and oh yeah that big beer gut of mine.

On to the video - I felt like I needed to validate myself there.  This ""Basic Step"" video is indeed that - very basic.  However as a returnee to Step after a decade, ""Basic"" isn't a bad thing.  I have had to refamiliarize myself with the motions, with the fatigue, with the tripping and stumbling.  This workout is rather simple and easy to accomplish.  It is a rather short video, and Cathe gives very little warning before changing moves - those are my biggest complaint.  Most of my stumbling occurs when I begin repeating a move only to have her start somethign new WHILE telling us to start something new.  I can only imagine how many times her and her backup ""Steppers"" rehearsed this, as none of them seem to miss a beat.

Still, it's a small gripe against a relatively solid product.  Remember that the idea of this video is to get you started.  I have already purchased intermediate level videos, which I plan on turning to after only a month of using this video.

In closing, this video is a good start.  You will eventually need other videos.

**UPDATE**

I've now been using this product for a few months.  My endurance has definitely improved and I've been able to raise my step to the next height.  The video has become familiar enough that I can use it on a low volume level while still watching another TV - cuts down on the boredom of exercise!

I do feel that I have ""outstepped"" this video and will begin using an intermediate video in the coming days.  I can definitely say that Cathe has restored my stepping confidence, and I will look into her other videos for future use.  If you really want to start or return to stepping, try this video out.  I don't think you'll be dissapointed.",1212105600,22,2341,4.485781990521327
2664126,4,B000IVQALO,"Cathe is a great instructor.  I felt that her pace was easy enough for beginners, and yet you could ramp it up for advanced.  It might have been a bit longer.",1205798400,,158,4.064516129032258
2664127,5,B000IVQALO,I got this video with the exercise step I purchased. Everytime I put this video on I get a great workout. I sweat so much my hair feels like I just washed it. this is the first aerobic step workout I've ever done so I didn't know any of the moves but after the first couple of tries I was good to go. I recommend this video to anyone.,1177632000,12,334,3.8550724637681157
2664128,5,B000IVQALO,"This workout (along with another more advanced one with Cathe Friedrich) came with my Original Club Step that I purchased recently. The routine is about 30 minutes and introduces you to basic step sequences to prepare you for advanced routines down the line.  I began with only one set of risers for the first few times so I wouldn't trip and injure myself!  I have now progressed to the full height with this routine and am almost ready to move on.  I have been exercising at home with a large collection of vids for nearly two years, and cannot believe that I am just now beginning to step.. the workout is so intense, especially for the legs and buns.  I felt like a total fool the first time around with this routine and felt like I would never get it, but I did and so will you if you stick with it.. it is so fun and I cannot believe the amount of energy I have afterwards.  Cathe is WONDERFUL - I will be purchasing more of her advanced workouts for sure.  This is such a great buy if you are new to step!",1168560000,29,1012,4.190721649484536
2664129,4,B000IVQALO,Catherine always kills you... this is not a beginners tape this is a intermediate level.,1443139200,,88,4.933333333333334
2664130,5,B000IVQALO,I have had a copy of this for YEARS. I bought this for my mother so we can work out together.  She loves it!,1438041600,,108,3.5
2664131,5,B000IVQALO,good workout.  Love Cathe's workouts anyway,1437609600,,43,6.166666666666667
2664132,5,B000IVQALO,This is the same Cardio and Weights routine that is packaged with IMAX2 but without premixes (however that disc costs 2X more than this).,1432684800,,137,4.75

2664136,4,B000IVQALO,"Basic step is too basic for someone who has been doing step a while, but Cathe Friedrich is very fun.  If this one is too easy, try a more advanced Cathe workout!",1410393600,,162,4.0625

2664138,5,B000IVQALO,"This is a basic step a video. It's not hard to follow. I think the people that have trouble with cueing and missing steps is because they don't have the steps memorize themselves. Cathe not only tells watchers to transition into a new step, she cues with her hand as to which direction she's going to start. I can possibly see how people who are paying attention to their own step and their own feet miss this physical cues. I watched this video once all the way through. Then I did it a second time and followed her without using my step. The third time I used my step and had no problem following her or executing the moves. I haven't set foot on an aerobics step in 20 years and this was a great, easy refresher back into it.",1408147200,2,728,4.207142857142857
2664139,5,B000IVQALO,I'm new to step so it was just right for me. Enough steps to make it fun. I could definitely work up a sweat.,1394928000,,109,3.5833333333333335
2664140,5,B000IVQALO,I've always enjoyed doing s step work out and since I haven't done a step workout in many years this Dvd was excellent at getting me back into stepping.  This is an excellent beginner's step Dvd and the basic steps moves are shown so that any beginner can pick up the moves.  If your looking for a beginner's step workout program then this is the one to chose.,1392681600,,360,4.279411764705882
2664141,2,B000IVQALO,"Somehow I would have thought the step aerobics would have gotten better with time. Clearly, this video was not for me. Poor production value, uninspiring, and fundamentally I'm not a fan of the instructor. It was so monotonous and drab I went searching for the video I used to do as a kid. Step Reebok (1992). They still sell it on VHS here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Reebok-The-Video-Reebok-Release/dp/B0001USM4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Reebok: The Video (Reebok Release)</a>&nbsp;But thankfully someone uploaded that onto youtube. For which I am eternally grateful.",1386115200,,629,6.590361445783133
2664142,3,B000IVQALO,I have taken aerobics before many times and the instructor is always with her back to you.  I feel this basic step would be so much easier for beginners and regular users if you were seeing it from the proper perspective for foot placement.  When you are looking at the instructor you do not follow the steps as easily because it is like you are looking in a mirror.  If you were looking at it from the back you would be able to follow her left and right foot placement exactly and it would be so much easier.  It would be really nice to have a DVD like that.  I would purchase one in a heartbeat!,1375660800,,597,4.112068965517241
2664143,5,B000IVQALO,"I previously had this workout but played it so much it was scratched beyond repair!! I was happy to find it on Amazon and purchased it as soon as I saw it.  It's intense and gives you a great workout, in true ""Cathe"" form.  I just wish there was a little less weights and one more step combo routine.",1373500800,,300,4.067796610169491
2664144,5,B000IVQALO,"For a step workout, this one isn't long. But step cardio is intense, so it is very nice to have this relatively short option (about 25 minutes for the basic step). The ""routine"" is not complex, but is interesting, and the time flies by. I'm 52, workout regularly, and this one is no problem at all for me (but keeps my heart rate in zone 2-3, just where I need it). I recommend it, it is a go-to in my workout library!",1365811200,,418,4.109756097560975
2664145,5,B000IVQALO,"I purchased a step with the platforms at the local Goodwill for 20$.  However, I had no Step Videos, and so after scouring the thrift stores for whatever I could find (imho, the cheapest way to find exercise dvd's and videos and other exercise equipment is at the thrift store!) I decided to look online at some of the instructors.  I watched Cathe Friedrich online, and decided that if I was going to use my newly acquired Step, this would be the person I would want to train me.  The music is fine, her style is easy to follow, and I am having fun Steppin' in SoCal!!",1365724800,,569,4.299065420560748
2664146,3,B000IVQALO,I was looking for something REALLY basic.  I am older and was told that using the step was a good cardio workout.  I thought basic step would be a simple routine but this is too complicated and you need to be a dancer or something.  The word basic is a misnomer.,1361232000,,262,4.098039215686274
2664147,5,B000IVQALO,I bought this to tone up and that's exactly what I have done. The workout is not so strenuous that I can't do anything afterwards. I find that it's just right for me.,1357430400,,166,4.0606060606060606
2664148,5,B000IVQALO,I bought the step at a garage sale and was so happy that I was able to find the DVD that goes with it. Love it!,1357430400,,111,3.3076923076923075
2664149,5,B000IVQALO,"I really like this workout.  It is about 28 minutes of working out, then a cool down that I really like.  I use it at least once a week to maintain my weight loss.  When my grandson lost my disc on me, I ordered a new one instead of buying a different one, because I really like this one.  I rate it 5 stars.  A+",1354233600,,312,3.7384615384615385

2664151,5,B000IVQALO,"I have many workout DVDs and I also workout at a gym.  Cathe Friedrich, Basic Step + Cardio & Weights DVD is by far the best.  I wish I could keep up with Cathe and her team,  They work too fast.  But it provides me with a challenge to work harder. I like the routine of step aerobics, weights and floor exercise; and each section is for a short time. So if I am ready to quit I work a little hard cause I know it will be over soon. I think her team, her routine, the workout clothing and color coordination and music are all a class act.",1345939200,,538,3.908256880733945

2664153,4,B000IVQALO,"This dvd is great for beginners.  You will sweat, and get a great workout. I'm at the point of of using the 2nd step and getting through it.

2664154,4,B000IVQALO,"I wanted a basic step work out and that is what this is.  I've followed step for many years, so this was an ideal product for me.  It would take a lot of practice for a beginner as she doesn't do a lot of repeat steps during her routine.",1295308800,,237,3.816326530612245
2664155,5,B000IVQALO,"I did step aerobics years ago and have enjoyed getting back into it.  I love this quick routine because I don't have a lot of time to work out and this gives me a good sweaty workout.  There is no complicated choreography, just basic step moves and a good variety.

I've never done step before. So I bought this and what i needed and did her beginner rotation. My way of doing her step. Don't do her arm movements until you get the foot work down. I only looked at her feet, and yes I stumbled a lot. But I kept at it, and did a lot of rewinding. Even on her other step workout dvds, I still stumble some and/or I didn't get it and still have to rewind. I started from no step experience, to mimicking the step (pick a spot where your step is going to be and pretend it's there), to only following foot work, to doing the arm movements, to now jumping on the step, getting more intense. I am definitely a cathe fan now. I learned that you have to grow with cathe, and she is one of the few trainers that are advanced.
