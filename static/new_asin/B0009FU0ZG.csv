2289256,2,B0009FU0ZG,"7 Seconds is a formulaic capper that's not entertaining at all. The car chases are ok, but nothing to write home about. It's a regular Snipes movie, but lacking fun. It's long, illogical (which isn't bad if it's entertaining),  and just plain boring.",1125792000,2,250,4.813953488372093
2289257,1,B0009FU0ZG,"Seven seconds, is about how long you want to watch this piece of garbage!  No wonder I've never heard of this movie, it's a disaster!  Almost every movie I've seen Wesley Snipes in is good.  So I figured I was going to see a decent movie when I rented this. WRONG!  It's very hard to understand, exactly what's going on in this movie. It was dragged out, and just plain ridiculous!  Every review on Amazon for this movie so far is bad, we can't all be wrong.",1125100800,3,458,4.218390804597701

2289259,1,B0009FU0ZG,"I work for hollywood video and this movie has been rented out for like 3 or 4 weeks since it was released on dvd, so I figured since it's been renting so much then it must be good, right? Man, it was so hard to get through this movie. Like, most of the reviews have said, the beginning part was alright but after that it just took a nose dive. I really wanted to turn this movie off in the middle cause I just couldn't take it but I was able to get through it (with a little fast forwarding). The acting was just so bad and the story was pointless. So, whatever you do please don't watch this movie...believe me, you'll thank me in the future.",1123200000,4,643,4.070866141732283
2289260,2,B0009FU0ZG,"This movie was about as bad a movie as Snipes has ever made. Like the other review the beginning takes off nicely, but the flim begins to out think itself with lots of twists and turns. Im not sure what country it was shot in but there was not any dubbing of voices. I think Snipes just wanted a quick payday on this movie. renter only.",1122854400,,336,4.106060606060606
2289261,2,B0009FU0ZG,"I am a Wesley Snipes fan, and not all that hard to please, but I must agree with previous reviewer - EAGAN, MN - that this is a lame movie and one I have no desire to ever see again. To answer the question about where the title came from, the timers on the phony explosive charges Snipe's gang uses on the first three armored cars, to get the more complicated robbery in motion, were set at 7 seconds. Just why this inconsequential fact deserves to be the title remains a mystery to me.",1121817600,2,486,4.180851063829787
2289262,2,B0009FU0ZG,"I didn't go into this with the highest hopes. How much can you honestly expect from a straight-to-dvd release? Regardless, snipes is a great action actor, so I decided to check it out. The first 20 minutes or so were actually very good! It begins with an elaborately planned armored car company robbery ending in a pretty cool car chase and a terrible double-cross. But then, it spirals downhill quickly. The middle of this movie was soooo boring I almost gave up.

The movie begins with snipes as an ex-special forces kind of guy now on the wrong side of the law. He plans this elaborate armored car company robbery, that goes terribly wrong. The woman he's ""with"" in the beginning gets kidnapped and he obviously has to rescue her. After the robbery goes wrong, he car jacks a lady who just happens to be a military official who must not be very busy because after she then makes it her personal mission to catch snipes. However, she SLOWLY, VERY SLOWLY, like so slow you could fall asleep, starts to realize that there are much badder people involved in the whole mess and then in the end teams up with snipes to get the real baddies. After the VERY SLOW middle part, the movie ends in another car chase.

This movie is almost totally predictable, it's not a very good story, and the acting is pretty poor. I think snipes did a good job with what was handed to him, and some of the action sequences were good. But for the most part, this was just another straight to dvd movie that we have grown to expect from people like van damn and seagal. Definitely a step back for snipes.

Rent it if you like, but buying it would be silly. You'll never watch it twice, and you probably won't even get through it once. Only die-hard snipes fans will be interested in this one. Hope this helps.

Oh, and by the way, maybe it was discussed in the boring middle somewhere, or maybe I just blinked and missed it, but why the heck was this movie called ""7 Seconds"" anyways?",1120521600,25,1961,4.423822714681441

  I have to say that I think I liked this movie, it was no were near Snipes other films but is was better then most of the straight to DVD action films coming out. I will agree that the first half of this film is really good and well executed. I will also agree that the last half is a little less interesting, though it is still certainly entertaining. I think Snipes made a wise decision by being apart of this film.

  This film produced by Andrew Stevens, who starred in one of my all time favorite films [The Terror Within], and has also produced other Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal, and Kevin Sorbo films is about a heist gone completely wrong. And in the process turns into a rescue mission to save a girl, you know typical action hero stuff. Of course Snipes isn't really a good guy in this as he is one of the men who pulled the original heist. Like most people have stated the first half of this film is great, the heist and counter heist were put together excellently. The film really has you interested and ready to see what happens next, but that is were it falls a little short. Don't get me wrong the movie is still good enough to watch even own, but get it used or something.

  Director Simon Fellows and writer Martin Wheeler did a really good job with this low budget flick, you can tell both set forth to create an entertaining film for movie goers to see. Also performances were top notch, which for a low budget action flick is rare these days. Wesley Snipes obviously did is thing in this film, as did all of the other actors in this film. I really enjoyed this movie and I think most of you will as well. It is not a classic award winning production but it is good for a rainy day when you just need to relax.",1215907200,4,1743,4.225903614457831
2289289,3,B0009FU0ZG,"Wesley Snipes plays an ex soldier who is now into the life of crime. He has set up a heist to steal 20 million from armoured trucks from casinos and take himself, his girl and some friends to catch the rays on a sunny beach somewhere in paradise.

However, the plan does not go right. Someone has double-crossed them, and they end up being hijacked themselves by another group who take out (kill) most of the group of hijackers.

Wesley escapes the attack, and winds up involved with a army gal, and there adventure begins trying to clear her name, and him trying to figure out who set him up, and why.

It's full of action, lots of bang bangs and violence. The typical kind of ""I'm the good guy hero, just need to clear my name so the cops don't think I'm a killer thing, think I'll track down the bad guy with a mansion protected by a fortress and shoot them up all up and come out and kiss the girl in the end""... you know the movie. Typical seen-it-before kind of thing, but still enjoyable to watch how they do this one.",1214697600,,1025,4.246153846153846
2289290,2,B0009FU0ZG,People keep asking why the movie is called 7 Seconds. Its the setting of the plastique timers that were supposed to blow off the armored car doors at the beginning of the movie. GregG,1197072000,,183,4.411764705882353

2289293,2,B0009FU0ZG,"The latest heist by a professional thief and his team goes terribly awry, and the organizer of the flawless plans gets more than what he bargained for. Agents and mobsters chase him, but he keeps cool under pressure, frustrates other party's plans and can always extricate himself from the mire. This is a standard story format for action film. It looks clichd and predictable, but it works well with good rhythm in action and sure-handed guidance from the director. But ""7 Seconds"" doesn't have them.

Wesley Snipes plays the thief named Jack. Jack's failed robbery in Bucharest, Rumania, lands him in a fresh trouble because his girlfriend/partner-in-crime is kidnapped during the shoot-outs. He takes hostage a NATO military cop (Tamzin Outhwaite sporting her British accent) after the mayhem (and saving her life too), and engages in urban car chase with familiar settings. The story doesn't make much sense (why steal the money of casinos in Rumania?), but the earlier part of ""7 Seconds"" is fun with decent car stunts and a little bit of humor. The actions are confusing, and you don't know where these wildly running cars are going, but at least the stunts themselves are not bad.

Then in the film's middle section tedium settles in, which stops the actions and starts to introduce superfluous characters, plus an unnecessary plot twist or two. We don't need to see Wesley Snipes walking in the station and putting a brief case in the coin locker there. Or actually we don't care what the briefcase really contains at all; and we don't even want to know whether something in it (whatever it is) is real or not. We want thrill and action, or funny dialogues. Except for some brief martial arts stunts and mildly amusing banter between Snipes and Outhwaite, ""7 Seconds"" doesn't have much to show, particularly in its second part, where the film has another car stunt sequence involving street cars, but it is marred by choppy editing.

We often hear complaint or criticism about direct-to-video films, but actually some of them are pretty good, offering diverting 90 minutes like the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Unfortunately, for all the fairly good acting from the stars, Wesley Snipes' ""7 Seconds"" is not one of them.",1175385600,3,2249,4.928759894459103
2289294,3,B0009FU0ZG,"I've been a big fan of Wesley Snipes for the last fifteen years, since his film, Passenger 57.  When I saw Wesley in that movie, using his martial arts skills for the first time, I thought to myself that this guy fights just like the late Bruce Lee.  After that I followed every action movie that he did just so I could watch him do his martial arts.  Of course, his ""Blade"" trilogy series is perhaps the most memorable of all the films that he's done.  The role of Blade fits Wesley like a tight glove, plus it gives him the opportunity to really go all out with his martial arts.  Since 2004 and Blade: Trinity, Wesley has opted to do films based in Europe.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe it has something to do with the money that the IRS claims he owes in back taxes.  Whatever the reason for this decision, it certainly has affected the quality of his films.  In fact, they've pretty much gone down hill in a similar vein as those done by Steven Seagal.  The only redeeming quality of Wesley's European movies is that he still does his own martial arts and can still kick ass in a big way.

In 7 Seconds, Wesley Snipes plays Jack Tolliver, who used to be with Delta Force.  Due to a physical confrontation with his commander after a number of his men are killed, Tolliver ends up spending four years in prison.  When he gets out, Tolliver decides to use his unique skills in the Romanian criminal underworld and plans a special heist down to the last second that will net he and his gang twenty million dollars.  Everything goes perfectly, until the very end when his operation is betrayed from the inside so that the Russian gangsters can get their hands on an authentic Van Gogh painting, worth over sixty-five million dollars.  Almost all of Tolliver's crew is murdered.  Though his girlfriend is taken hostage, he manages to escape with a metal case that has the painting in it.  Tolliver, however, doesn't know what's in the mysterious case.  He inadvertently runs into Sergeant Kelly Anders (played by Tamzin Outhwaite), who's with the Military Police at the nearby NATO Air Force Base, while he's being chased by the police and the Russian mafia.  He keeps her from being shot and then uses her car to elude the people that are after him.  As the movie progresses, Tolliver will find himself alone and forced to turn to Anders for help, who now has her own problems to deal with.  Together, they will take on the Russian mafia and try to rescue Tolliver's girlfriend.

I honestly didn't think that the movie made a lot of sense.  I got confused at the beginning of the film when the heist of the casino money and the three armored trucks supposedly takes place.  I wasn't following what was happening, and it looked like someone had screwed up with the planning and the intelligence on how the doors to the trucks were to be opened.  Then, after Kelly Anders is basically kidnapped and her car wrecked, the Romanian police accuse her of being Tolliver's accomplice.  Even her own people seem to have their doubts as to her innocence.  That just didn't ring true to me.  We also have the owner of the Van Gogh painting and the head of the Russian mafia (he has Parkinson's Disease and shakes all of the time) who seem to want the painting back for insurance purposes.  When the Russians have Tolliver at their mercy and torture him and his girlfriend to find out where the painting is at, they forget to check his pockets for the key to the locker at the Bus Terminal, or is it the Plane Terminal, and then they allow him to take them to the locker.  How stupid can you be?  Cut off some fingers and some toes.  He'll talk.  Whatever you do, don't let him loose, or else he'll come back and kill you.  The two car chases in the movie were so-so.  It's difficult to make the cars appear as if they're going fast when they're small and running on four cylinders.  The highlight of the movie is getting to watch Wesley Snipes do his martial arts.  He's probably the best film fighter in the movies today.  I'm always impressed with his hands and kicks, and the way he uses his knees and elbows to block and attack.  That's really the only reason to watch an action thriller with Snipes in it, unless it's one of the ""Blade"" movies.  Though 7 Seconds isn't the worse movie I've seen during the past year, it still could've been a lot better.  The script could've been better, the acting, the stunts, the photography, and the directing.  This is why the movie went straight to video here in the States.  Come on, Wesley, we need another ""Blade"" movie before you get too old to do them!",1167868800,,4588,4.462740384615385
2289295,2,B0009FU0ZG,"I really like Wesley Snipes and I really like action movies. This movie disappointed on both accounts. I had to wonder what Snipes was thinking in doing this film. I still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters, so why do a straight-to-video movie. Truthfully I didn't even read the cover before renting it because it was Wesley Snipes but even if I did I would have still rented it.

The movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist, which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase. After that, the movie seems to fizzle out.

There is not much dialogue and I think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film. The acting is pretty bad all around, although I think Snipes did what he could with what he as given.

The directing is frazzled and just plain weird. I didn't like it much at all. I think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse.

Given the right attention, this movie could have been great but I get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could. It has potential, but in my opinion, everyone involved in it just fell flat.

I had trouble getting through the whole thing. If you are a die hard Snipes fan then you might want to rent it, but I don't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not. It just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious I have ever seen.

Don't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you've wasted your time watching it. Only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are.",1149724800,,1798,4.197101449275363

If you liked Drop Zone, Money Train, Murder At 1600 then you should have no problem enjoying 7 Seconds. It's a good thriller with Snipes in top form with some good action sequences and 3 nice martial arts fight scenes by Snipes. I can't understand all the negitivity for this movie.

The ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love!  Huh, they were a romantic interest?
