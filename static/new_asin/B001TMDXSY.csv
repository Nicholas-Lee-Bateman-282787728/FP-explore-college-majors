8342126,5,B001TMDXSY,"I own the Relationship Management DVD and watched it several times. It was not the first book/dvd I watched/read from Love Systems and it won't be the last. This dvd does a fantastic job of covering the different kinds of relationships from long-term to friends with benefits. Personally I really enjoyed the section on ""Friends with Benefits"" and how to handle this type of a relationship. For years I always felt like when I met a girl I had to make her my girlfriend. I mean that's what society expects from us right? That's what our fathers, cousins, brothers and friends all did right? Well I've learned that not all women are looking for a look term relationship and this dvd helps in setting the bar from the get-go. I could go into a ton of detail but you're not going to learn much from me, Lol. I highly recommend Love Systems and this dvd.",1323302400,,850,4.490322580645161
8342127,5,B001TMDXSY,"May I start off by saying this is an eye-opening product. Nick Savoy has put so much into this, it's hard not to go 'damn, what have i been thinking!' when you finish watching all 3 discs.

The Relationship Management Set will give you guidelines and help you understand how to better handle the kind of relationship you are in. It covers everything from High-Commitment Traditional Relationships to the commonly asked about ""Friends with benefits"" situation. I can comment on how useful it was to me in terms of understanding how to balance my life so I can keep my long term girlfriend next to me. Nick provides some key insights in terms of relationship frames, tempo and overall behavior guidelines.

An equal amount of time is spent on each relationship time, which makes the product suitable to almost any situation you might be in. Nick even takes the time to point out how one might change his relationship type will still remaining in the same commitment zone.

Most other products I've read/seen never quite look into Infidelity as much as I would have liked them to have - this product surpasses them all, Nick presents his clear and concise ""Three-Part Infidelity Model"" which will give you a good idea as to why your girlfriend cheated and what can you do to prevent yourself from suffering through this kind of humiliation again.

There is a Bonus Q & A section which digs even deeper and if you've been introduced to the seduction community before - this section will most likely please you.

Overall, best Nick Savoy product out there in my opinion. I recommend you get this just as much as I would recommend you get Magic Bullets if you haven't already.",1323043200,,1670,4.705479452054795
8342128,5,B001TMDXSY,"The funny thing is if you've been in any committed relationship this video points out and defines and explains soo many things that will hold relevant to you. I've studied game off and on for around 4-5 years and regardless if you've been around the community or have no idea that it exists this DVD and love systems in general( I've bought several other products from these guys) ex plain and coach in a way that just makes sense. It's sometimes so obvious you'll have moments where you'll kick yourself for not recognizing something earlier. Even looking at my most recent past relationship to the few girls I am currently dating I'm far more aware now of the signals I gave off and to why situations ended up the way they did regardless of considering it ""good"" or ""bad"". The ideas inside this DVD  exist as behavioral science and regardless of associating this with psychology dating or even pick up . The information holds true. Love systems are true teachers that will not only help out with your dating and relationships but really build a strong foundation in any the endeavors you might face in all facets of your life. If your on the fence about picking this up I have to say action will get you the results. And you'll be pleasantly surprised  if not in awe of the things this will open up to you.",1322352000,,1308,4.514767932489452
8342129,5,B001TMDXSY,"Most of the time we look for material that teach us how to pick up girls, and hey! that is great, but how about to KEEP those girls you picked up? how about to avoid being dumped? what about more love or sex and less drama? relationships are not just one night stands, they go from the very moment you date someone for the 1st time, to the top of the chain wich is a traditional long-term relationship (Including ""friend with benefits"", ""threesomes"" and open relationships)

This DVD set will help you out to understand the principles of how to manage those relationships explained by the author himself and how to avoid making a lot of the mistakes we usually do when we get involved into a relationship.

Great stuff for people that are tasting the changes of a new life with women, but don't have a clue on how to keep the girl, to intermediate guys that have already a relationship with that hot women, but are having a lot of issues to keep the relationship going (A common mistake we do when we get involved into a relationship the first couple of times).

If you want to continue your journey through the world of seduction and be a better man, definitely this DVD's will help you out to understand how to keep a woman and know what you want with them.",1321833600,,1259,4.394849785407725
8342130,5,B001TMDXSY,"If you're like I was when I started out with my game, you probably overlooked the value of relationship management. I'm of course referring to ""relationships"" as your interactions with a woman after having seduced them. It is a common mistake to think that the word ""relationship"" only refers to boyfriend and girlfriend in the traditional sense, only dating each other, etc. This is but one misunderstanding that Nick Savoy was able to enlighten me to in the DVD set.

That being said, one of the most useful points of the DVD for me was when Savoy listed and went into detail about the different types of relationships. He described that different types of relationships have different levels of commitment, how to move between the levels, and how to get the type of relationship that you want. You can get more than you think! I urge those thinking of buying the DVD not to limit themselves by the common misconceptions that they see in the movies or society. There's nothing that says you can't have several friends with benefits relationships if that's what you want. In fact, after buying the DVD that's exactly what I set out to do. By applying what I learned in the DVD, I was soon able to have three consistent friends with benefits without having to lie about it! This last part is huge for me, because I'm big on honesty in general. In fact, there is a part in the DVD where Savoy mentions honesty in relationships from a practical perspective, whatever your moral view on it may be.

I think it's fair to mention that you don't need to be in a relationship to reap the benefits of the product. In fact, I would even say it's better to buy it when you're single. When I purchased it I was in a semi-relationship with a girl and I wanted this DVD to fix everything because I felt like I was losing her. After buying it, my eyes were suddenly open as to why I was in that downward situation with her in the first place! Not only that, but I now had the knowledge to realize this relationship was at its end and the courage to be the man and end it myself. Afterwards, the information in the DVD became much more useful to me because I had a better idea of the kind of relationship I wanted and the kind of man I wanted to be BEFORE I got into my next relationship. Setting a strong frame in the first interactions sets the tone for the rest of the time with the woman, no matter what relationship it is that you want.

Since I've bought Relationship Management I've gone back to watch it once or twice to review. The core concepts stuck with me of course, but it was nice to be able to review specifics after a while. Also, the Q&A is useful to watch again in case you encounter any of the same questions that some of the other guys that took the seminar might've had. I heard someone in the community discussing the topic once and it went along the lines of ""To get good at pickup you have to get good at relationship management. Once you can consistently approach, date, and close beautiful women the relationship inevitably comes next."" It's the truth! Gaming with no relationship management skills is like boating without a compass. It's easy jumping in and it will be fine for a while, but eventually you gotta figure out where the heck you're going. The sooner you start the better it will be!",1307232000,,3308,4.4375
8342131,5,B001TMDXSY,"Common sense is not commonly applied. Often even people who are really successful in many areas of life have real weaknesses in basic areas, and I don't know anyone who doesn't have a serious difficulty with something that most people find easy, such as their weight, finances, work, romantic relationships, parenting, academics, driving, you name it.

I have this, and I have to say that before I found the community about the only thing I had that I could do well was cold approach/SNL. Ironic that this is considered advanced, because I sucked at all the other stuff. This product (The Relationship Management DVDs), The Approaches' Master Your Social Destiny, and my friend Karea's advice have enabled me to get relationships that last longer than a week or two. The best thing is that this product enabled me to have a lot of sex I could have been having, but because I didn't know how to manage expectations I wasn't even bothering to engage in it at all, and now that I know I won't be breaking any hearts I'm comfortable having those friends with benefits. I should also have some 3some reports shortly because of this.",1235779200,2,1127,4.720812182741117
8342132,5,B001TMDXSY,"I got the DVDs in the mail last Saturday and I literally watched them non-stop glued to every minute.

The foundations were helpful and the three rules of relationships are great guides. Next came an overview of the different types of relationships followed by general prinicpals that apply to all relationships (I would list them but I am unsure how much detail I can provide). Savoy then goes into each type of relationship in detail and provides very sound advice in each case. I myself am on the verge of a traditional relationship so I was particularly glued to this part and I found some pretty useful information there. I would have liked a bit more information on the traditional relationship because I did know some of the rules Savoy outlined from Magic Bullets and the Friends with Benefits interview. But this part was supplemented later with some interesting stuff.

After the types of relationships comes a section on how to change relationship types which was very insightful. One of my favorite parts was next: the model of predicting infidelity. This part was pure genius and I got a lot of great information here. A subheading of this came up when Savoy gave advice what to do when a guy starts flirting with your girlfriend and it was not what I expected. I have definitely addressed this issue incorrectly in the past and I was writing FURIOUSLY during this part.

After each section was a Q & A and for the most part these were helpful as well. The bonus Q & A disc was a mixed bag in my opinion. Granted, it was a bonus, but some of the questions seemed not useful to me. Maybe for others they would prove useful.

Overall, I would give this product my unreserved recommendation! The video is well produced, professional, and full of great advice. It is definitely the essential relationship guide and I am sure I will consult it frequently in the future.",1235692800,2,1877,4.644578313253012
