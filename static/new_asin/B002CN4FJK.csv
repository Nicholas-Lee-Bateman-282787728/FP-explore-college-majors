8364310,3,B002CN4FJK,"What a disappointment! I ordered this Region 2 set on the basis of another Anchor Bay Coffin Box Set THE TIGON COLLECTION which I enjoyed but this collection has issues. The most serious is the condition of the prints used for the DVD transfers. I've seen drive-in prints that looked better. HOUSE OF WHIPCORD and HOUSE OF MORTAL SIN are so dark in places it's as if someone deliberately darkened the R rated parts of both films. THE COMEBACK, FRIGHTMARE, and DIE SCREAMING MARIANNE fare better but they all have some form of print wear. I am somewhat surprised that Anchor Bay would use these prints as the quality of their American release DVDs has always been of a very high quality. More than likely they are the only ones they could get their hands on.

Then we come to the films themselves. With the exception of his first non-""girlie"" film DIE SCREAMING MARIANNE which, while not a horror film, does have its moments including a fine performance from veteran Brit supporting player Leo Genn, the other four fall neatly into the category of what I call English Giallo. They all have modern settings and are basically brutal crime pictures without a whiff of the supernatural. Both HOUSE pictures are message movies in a big way with WHIPCORD dedicated to those who would like to see a return to corporal punishment while MORTAL SIN, as the title implies, is very anti-Catholic for its day. FRIGHTMARE, about modern day cannibalism, is easily the best film of the set while THE COMEBACK is better than its reputation.

Most of Pete Walker's films have a nasty edge to them but they are graced with a number of fine performances. Scottish actress Sheila Keith appears in the big 3 of this set (WHIPCORD, FRIGHTMARE, MORTAL SIN) and is memorable in every one. Rupert Davies as the tormented husband in FRIGHTMARE, Anthony Sharp as the killer priest in MORTAL SIN, Barbara Markham as the twisted warden in WHIPCORD, all turn in first rate work. Any study of the transformation of British horror films in the 1970s needs to include the movies of Pete Walker but, ugly and brutal as they often are, they deserve better treatment than they are given in this set. There are two definite pluses, Pete Walker's commentaries and each film comes with optional easy to read subtitles.",1416614400,,2277,4.747474747474747
