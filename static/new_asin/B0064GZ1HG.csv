4949448,3,B0064GZ1HG,"The movie was great as described, except the volume was an issue. I'll still watch it
though. The nanny being hired to live with the family all of a sudden wants to marry the man who hired her. So thrilling. But most importantly she was from the mental hospital. Which make it more thrilling.",1383004800,,292,4.425925925925926
4949449,2,B0064GZ1HG,"Volume is almost not there, have to turn tv way way up to hear movie a little bit.
Will not be watching this movie to often, as volume should be better.",1382313600,,152,3.935483870967742
4949450,1,B0064GZ1HG,I gave this movie a bad rating because the picture quality was just okay and the audio was absolutely horrible - It was either non existant or so loud you couldn't believe it.  I saw this movie on TV a few years ago and enjoyed it but the quality of this DVD was terrible.,1366675200,3,272,4.037037037037037
4949451,4,B0064GZ1HG,"The movie was good, but the sound was too low. Couldn't hear it very good, even when the TV on loudest it would go.",1359331200,,115,3.8333333333333335
4949452,1,B0064GZ1HG,I am very disappointed in the purchase of the DVD The Perfect Nanny ... I CAN'T EVEN HEAR IT EVEN WITH THE TV TURNED UP . This was the only problem I have ever had with the many purchases I have made . VERY DISSAPPOINTED CUSTOMER,1347235200,,229,4.0

4949454,1,B0064GZ1HG,"No volume at any normal level.  Plus, all swear words are blanked out as if this was nothing more than a copy from a TV version movie.  And the studio listed TUTM does not exist!!!  So put 3+3 together and you might conclude what I believe is going on with this DVD...Unrated...no less!!",1418342400,,287,4.377358490566038
4949455,5,B0064GZ1HG,So this is one of Lifetimes cheesy tv movie. But I do find it enjoyable.,1417392000,,72,3.8666666666666667
4949456,3,B0064GZ1HG,"Andrea (Tracy Nelson) attempts to kill herself when she discovers her man (Darren Gray Ward) in bed with another woman. Once she leaves the ""nut house"" she manages to swing a gig as a nanny for brain surgeon Dr. Robert Lewis (Bruce Boxleitner). Andrea is a hopeful romantic, wanting her life to be like a romance novel. She will stop at nothing (see woman with knife in hand on DVD cover) to get what she wants.

The film looks like it was made for TV. My slim-case version had the opening nudity blurred out as well as deleting the F-bomb, and S-word. It was almost PG. The movie turns into a dark comedy at the end when [PLOT SPOILER] mom becomes an enabler. It made me laugh, although I can't say that was the intent of the scene. The writing is so formulaic, it borders on comedy as we see obstacles getting removed.

I would imagine there are version with the opening sex scene with nudity intact as well as the swearing. The slim case doesn't have it.",1416528000,2,957,4.370786516853933
4949457,5,B0064GZ1HG,Awesome movie! Another satisfied Lifetime movie fan! Another case of a woman obsessed with widowed man and tries to win his affections by being perfect! Kinda cliched but still very enjoyable!,1404259200,,192,5.225806451612903
4949458,5,B0064GZ1HG,"THIS MOVIE IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS ONE
IT WAS A THRILLER I CAN REMEMBER SITTING ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT KIND OF MOVIE",1396828800,,150,3.71875
4949459,2,B0064GZ1HG,Movie played great . However just to hear the movie I needed to turn my volume all the way up !,1395014400,,95,3.5714285714285716
4949460,1,B0064GZ1HG,"I just can't express my disappointment with Amazon over this purchase. The dvd plays like a bootleg video it has little to no volume, I had to increase the volume of my television to 100 which is the maximum volume level. The movie's profanity was cut as if I viewed it on the Lifetime network and the case it came in was not the original box. I am an avid shopper of dvd's from Amazon.com, I am just very upset over the poor quality of this purchase. I will be sending it back ASAP !!!!",1393977600,,487,4.136842105263158
4949461,4,B0064GZ1HG,"Andrea McBride (Tracy Nelson) is a seductive young woman with a dangerous obsession- to live the idyllic life of a romance novel heroine. After being released from a mental institution Andrea gets her chance at a fairy tale ending with Dr. James Lewis (Bruce Boxleitner) a rich widower in desperate need of a nanny, but when her well laid plans start to fizzle, Andrea takes matters and a knife into her own hands.

""The Perfect Nanny"" is a titillating suspense thriller packed with heart stopping twists and turns & guaranteed to make you check your references twice.",1390780800,,568,4.855670103092783
4949462,3,B0064GZ1HG,"I was looking forward to getting this movie.  I love Tracy Nelson's crazy psycho character.  However there is a big problem with the audio because even on the max volume, you could barely hear it.  The seller refunded my money.",1384128000,,227,4.625

8492588,5,B0064GZ1HG,Steve the Nun is no innocent character in this murder for one purpose movie. You will see it build and build this psycho character,1477699200,,130,4.458333333333333

8492591,1,B0064GZ1HG,I have ordered this movie twice and it has no sound. Needs to be checked and replaced. Something is wrong with it.,1466035200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8492592,1,B0064GZ1HG,"Terrible quality!  Do not order this movie unless you want to mess around with returns.  I forgot to try and return it within the designated time, so I am stuck with it.  Like other users stated, there is virtually NO sound.  I had to turn the television to the loudest it would go to hear it, but in some parts it got so loud I had to turn it way down.  I kept turning it up, turning it down all through the movie, which was unsettling and annoying.  The cussing is dubbed out in a very tacky manner, the way it is on network sometimes.  I would rather hear the cusswords than the have them blipped out because it takes away from the overall satisfaction of the movie and distracts you.  I was happy to finally see the movie again, but terribly disappointed with the DVD itself.  It was extremely overpriced for such a terrible quality.

Please, buyer beware!  I don't think there are any good copies of this out there, from any seller.  Save your money.  I doubt a copy will ever arrive on dvd that meets standards because they seem to be slowly phasing them out.  I doubt even more movies such as this will EVER be on Blu-ray.",1454112000,,1129,4.289099526066351
8492593,1,B0064GZ1HG,The audio quality was really low. I could barely hear it unless the volume was all the way up and it was still hard to hear.,1453420800,,124,3.8076923076923075
8492594,1,B0064GZ1HG,"Terrible DVD....quality-wise. Audio is very, very faint!!! Can't hear it even with the volume all the way up:(",1445212800,,110,5.166666666666667
