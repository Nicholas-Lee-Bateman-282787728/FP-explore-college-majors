HAPPY BRUSH DAY: It's Ziggy's birthday and a disguised Robbie gives him a voice-activated candy maker. When Ziggy's mouth gets stuck together from too much taffy, the machine keeps going!",1431907200,,383,5.278688524590164

8112723,5,B000EQ5TTC,"I love this show! The songs and dances are lots of fun for preschool aged kids. The whole concept of the show is a little strange, but I like the idea of encouraging kids to get up and play. I just wish that these DVDs were more available in the United States.",1262822400,,260,4.019230769230769
8112724,5,B000EQ5TTC,"Sportacus and Stephanie:
sports candy = fruits and vegetables (better than ""real food"" which is what we called these two before)
junk food or healthy food: the prince and princess toss out this query before we eat anything
""let's go play and exercise first"" = anything that encourages mine to say this gets two thumbs up from me
Such a wonderful show with a nice Icelandic touch. How can we go wrong?",1235692800,,400,4.569444444444445
8112725,5,B000EQ5TTC,Our 2 year old daughter loves Lazytown!  We've got all the episodes on Tivo but really wanted to have some for the car.  Everyone in the family (she has a 16 year old brother) actually has a favorite character or episode.  I especially like the Lazy Scouts episode cause I love Robbie's song.  Our daughter loves Cry Dinosaur.  This dvd hasn't left the car dvd player since we got it.  She loves to watch it over & over again.  We highly recommend this dvd for the simple fact that it's got great messages that don't come off as an instructional video.  They're just plain fun.,1234742400,,577,4.428571428571429
8112726,5,B000EQ5TTC,"My daughter is crazy about Lazy Town and when I bought her this DVD I thought she would burn it up because that's all she would watch. We love it too. It teaches kids to eat right, exercise regularly, keep your room clean, keep promises, and so much more! I recommend this DVD for all parents to by their toddlers!!",1221868800,,315,4.266666666666667
8112727,5,B000EQ5TTC,"My 4-year-old loves LazyTown, and it is one of the few CD's I allow him to watch without me. The stories are simple but convey the old message: Get moving, don't eat too many sweets, get enough sleep, stick together as a team... yet the animation is young and colorful and positive. Cool music, too!",1167782400,,299,4.454545454545454
8112728,5,B000EQ5TTC,"The latest installment in the Lazytown DVD series brings four more episodes of the Nick Jnr. Television show best known for the aerobic antics of superhero and creator Magnus Scheving.  Obviously not short on confidence, Scheving bounces, flips, dances and jumps around the screen in a tight blue costume as Sportacus, the tenth superhero to make a home in Lazytown.  His scene stealing arch enemy Robbie Rotten again proves that even though his diabolical plots never work, he can hold his own as one of the coolest villains in children's television.

The plot for each episode revolves along the universal Lazytown themes of eating healthy fruit and vegetables (known as sports candy), and exercising.  Robbie Rotten does his cute little best to encourage the children to eat cake and candy and lie around doing nothing, while Sportacus proves to them that it's better to eat right, sleep right and do aerobics whenever possible.  Robbie is of course the ""Master of Disguise"" and has a fully equipped wardrobe to suit his every scheme.

The four episodes on this DVD are:

Sports Candy Festival - Stephanie and the kids decide to surprise Sportacus by holding a Festival in his honor.  Robbie is a bad apple, but Sportacus still ends up as the top banana.

Happy Brush Day - Ziggy's having a birthday party, and although Robbie's gift is the biggest, the little gift from Sportacus saves the day.

Play Day - Robbie excels as a cowboy in this one.  There's a great high noon showdown in the streets of Lazytown, but when Robbie starts monkeying around, Sportacus proves that he's the one to tame the beast.

Sportafake - Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but Robbie makes Sportacus look rather small until a good deed turns the tables on him.

With the usual great bouncy and catchy music and energetic dancing, this one is sure to please the little Stephanie, Sportacus and/or Robbie in your family.
