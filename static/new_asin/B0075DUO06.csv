This DVD has the original music form Tree House and not more recently from Nickelodeon Junior. However, the stories are the same and the only difference is the intro music. I actually like it better. There are over 20 episodes and it's a great value.",1452124800,,356,4.758064516129032
8510565,5,B0075DUO06,"These Little Bear DVDs are the greatest and I am so glad that I found them. The price is so good for the number of episodes that you receive, this one has twenty-two. I am still watching for the last two that seem to exist, I check for them nearly every day and hope they turn up eventually. There is no listing of the episodes on these DVDs so I have included them on all the ones that I have purchased and I hope that it is a help. If you have little ones that love Little Bear, this is the way to go.
