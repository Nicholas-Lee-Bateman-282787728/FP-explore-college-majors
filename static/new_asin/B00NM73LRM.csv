8679125,4,B00NM73LRM,"We have French/Tunisian young people who live or vacation in Corsica doing bad things. I know very simplistic of me but that is what I got. I did like it but it was odd in a few ways. One boy works with his father to clean a house, he brings his friends there to party, one steals things, the mob guy who owns it isn't happy, he sends goons to find out who robbed him and well it goes so0uth from there. Very sad story and disturbing too but well acted and beautiful to watch the scenery. How these chuckleheads came to make the decisions they made is way beyond me. Would I recommend it? I will say yes. Kind of shows how the modern generation is so inured to right or wrong and has this whole ""entitled"" thing going on.",1449705600,,721,4.120567375886525
8679126,3,B00NM73LRM,"While I appreciate the efforts of Film Movement to bring attention to movies that they deem worthy, and I also like that they are featuring some edgier films, I haven't always been favorably impressed with some of the selections.  That is the case for The Apaches (Les Apaches)(2013), which is set on the island of Corsica, and features French as the spoken language.

Aziz (Aziz El Hadachi) is the son of a man hired to do yard work at the home of an affluent French couple.  One night, a group of Aziz`s friends, have an unauthorized party at the home, swimming in the pool, drinking, and then eventually engaging in theft.  When it later turns out that some guns were stolen, tragedy follows, when some of teens refuse to return the weapons.

Technically, Apaches has good production values, and seems to feature some decent acting performances.  My issues were mainly with the story, which I found unfocused.  The relationships of the various characters was not very clear, and I failed to really identify with them.  At the end of the film, unfortunately the strongest emotion I had was disappointment.  I expected a story with a little more substance, instead of one that was so scattered.  The beauty of Corsica doesn't seem to be featured particularly well, as a swimming pool seems to become the film's main point of reference.  At 2.5 stars, The Apaches has some merit, but not enough to recommend a watch.

8679127,3,B00NM73LRM,"APACHES (Les Apaches) is  another film that smears the screen with crime and gross behavior. Written and directed by French actor Thierry de Peretti the film is supposed to make us examine the after effects of radical behavior.

As the synopsis rightly states, `While thousands of tourists invade the beaches and clubs of the picturesque island of Corsica, five beautiful but morally bankrupt teenagers spend their days aimlessly hanging out in the streets. One summer night, one invites the others to a vacant luxury villa he knows, where they spend the night swimming, drinking and hooking up. When they leave, they steal several valuables from the home, including two prize rifles. Upon returning from Paris to discover the theft and vandalism, the homeowner turns to a local crime boss for help, quickly igniting a chain reaction of violence and revenge the teens had never anticipated.'

Yes, things like this happen, buy the point of the film gets lost in the mayhem. Better just turn on the television to one of the many series that has similar behavior and elect another film to see. Grady Harp, December 14",1419206400,,1115,4.951871657754011
8679128,4,B00NM73LRM,"This is a little known French film from Thierry de Peretti who is better known for his acting in his native France. Here he tells the story of five friends who are all Corsican. This island paradise is invaded by the French elite every summer, where they party on down enjoy themselves and generally flaunt their wealth. Aziz and his parents look after the house of one such man. Then one night he and his four compatriots decide to do some partying themselves at the empty house. Only things get out of hand.

When the owner turns up he decides to bypass the police and get a local crime lord to do the investigating for him. This starts a chain of events that leads to extreme actions by the kids and what started out as a bit of a laugh becomes something more deadly altogether.

This is a film of different parts and different paces. It starts out very strong and has a sense of urgency that carries you with it. As events unfold this immediacy peaks and then it descends into almost nothing. However, I think that may be the point given the consequences of what takes place; at 84 minutes it is not the longest film ever and for the most part it is both compelling and convincing. The idea that kids make stupid decisions based on things they did earlier that were equally as stupid is a very good one and I think this manages to convey that. It is generally well made and filmed and was part of the Cannes Directors Fortnight - this is presented in French with good sub titles and contains a bonus short film that is also quite good.",1416700800,,1539,4.358885017421603
8679129,4,B00NM73LRM,"""Apaches"" (2013 release from France; 84 min.) brings the story of a group of teenagers in Corsica. As the movie opens, we see an older guy and his son taking care of a beautiful house owned by a French family that is about to arrive for the summer. Later that evening, the son, Aziz, returns with 4 other friends and they hold an impromptu pool party while along the way trashing some of the house and stealing some things. In the days after, questions are raised and Aziz returns the stolen stuff. What he didn't know is that his friends also stole an expensive rifle... To tell  you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie is set on the French island of Corsica, a rarely used setting in the movies. We later learn from the director that for him this was the point of the movie, to essentially showcase Corsica. Goal accomplished. Second, many in the group of the teenagers are of Moroccan descent, and the movie creates the impression that lots of Muslims live in Corsica (I have no idea whether this is an accurate reflection of reality). Third, the movie records what the teenagers do without making any judgment on their actions (similar to, say, Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring). Contrary to the impression created by the DVD's front jacket (""Parties Booze Sex Murder.""), the movie is much more than a ""party movie"". Yes, there is some of that, but the second half of the movie becomes a much more compelling psychological study of the youngsters.

This was the November, 2014 release of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-month Club. As always, the DVD comes with a bous shortie, and this time we get ""Margerita"" (2013 release from Italy; 15 min.), in which a burglar with an appreciation for classical music, finds that the house he is robbing is owned by a famous classical violinist. What will the burglar do? Just watch! Back to the main attraction: ""Apaches"" is a worthy addition to Film Movement's ever-growing catalog of foreign and indie movies.",1416614400,,2051,4.723463687150838
8679130,4,B00NM73LRM,"On the island of Corsica, where thousands of tourists go to find fun in the sun every summer, life for the local teenagers is  far less interesting.  Five of them figure out a way to break into an elegant villa and spend a night carousing.  The next morning they compound their transgressions by stealing several valuable items  from the villa before making what they think is a clean get away.  Unfortunately for them, the villa's owners are not people to be crossed.  When they discover the burglary and vandalism they turn to a local crime boss for revenge, and events quickly spiral out of control, changing the teens' lives forever.

This film is part crime drama and part teenage angst movie.  The actors portraying the teenagers do an excellent job of depicting how empty and boring their lives are, even in what appears to be a very elegant resort community.  An additional attraction is the beautiful landscape of Corsica: the verdant hills and the deep blue Mediterranean.  In French, with English subtitles.",1416441600,,1018,4.866279069767442
