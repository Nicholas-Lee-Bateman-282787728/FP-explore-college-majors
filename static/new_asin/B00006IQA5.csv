1776807,5,B00006IQA5,"I am a bellydancer who also likes to workout and I found these DVDs a great collection. There is an intro DVD that is great for beginners, but a fun workout if you are more experienced. There is also an advanced DVD that gives you something to look forward to if you are just beginning. I found the workout challenging on many levels and I learned some new bellydance moves! The advanced is called Warrior Goddess and it does encourage you to challenge yourself! The finger cymbals is a fun video and I don't know any other video/DVD that teaches this in a way that you can really learn to play them. The veil DVD was a great workout for the arms and as an experienced bellydancer, I did learn some new moves. The production quality is very nice, costumes are inspiring and they never get boring, no matter how many times you do it.",1040256000,39,832,4.374193548387097
1776838,2,B00006IQA5,"The sets are beautiful, no doubt about it, but the overall instruction is poorly done.

First, the camera spends more time on her face then on anything else with only glimpses of her feet.  I found it difficult to follow her without being able to see her body movements.

Second, the costumes are distracting.  It is difficult to learn different moves when her outfits are covering up most of her body making it nearly impossible to see where her feet are, how her hips are moving, or how her knees are positioned.

Thirdly, (and this may, or may not interest others) but her spiritual comments are not what I am interested in.  I want to learn the movements and have a good workout, not have a philosophical discussion.

The movements are done quickly and if I did not have some experience with belly dancing moves, then I would not have been able to keep up or figure out what she was doing.

Yes, this is a workout that will certainly work-you-out (especially the warrior goddess which is not for the beginner), but I do not find these DVD's to be helpful overall.

The zils and veils are very informative, but they are not my favorites compared to other DVD's I have purchased.

If you want a good workout with great sets and colorful costumes, this may be the one for you.

If you are looking for a basic belly dancing workout that is easy to follow and improves your knowledge of basic belly dancing movements, then I do not recommend this one.",1145750400,7,1450,4.4961832061068705
1776839,5,B00006IQA5,"These are great for a beginning dancer with proper expectations.  She breaks down the movements and each dvd ends by teaching a complete routine that can then be practiced without the dvd (cuz the songs are easy to find, each dvd has an accompying cd with really nice world music- subtle enough for background dinner music... and when the routine song comes along at the end of your meal, you can jump up and dance for your guests).  I strongly recommend getting the cds also because after a couple weeks you will have the routine memerized and might want to just pop in the cd and practice in front of a mirror instead of your tv, so you can perfect your form.

Dolphina has been accused of being an airhead but I found her to be sweet and encouraging.  She is just trying to make it fun. If you are a beginner, you will find these challenging but will probably be able to get the hang of it in a week or so.  The drawback to the routines is that she just goes through it- no breakdowns or warning- she tells you what she is doing as she does it but it is very fast. But the routines aren't hard once you have tried them a few times.

I do not like her finger cymbal dvd as much as the one by Caroleena Nerrichio (sp?).  Dolphina's is harder than it needs to be.  She jumps into it too quickly.  Caroleena gets you comfortable with your zills, helps you listen for rhythems and THEN combines them with movement.  After I did dolphina's, I felt like zills were really hard... but when I did it with Caroleena's I felt like ""zills are totally easy, what did I think they were so hard for?"" and teaching style had ALOT to do with that.

But bottom line- if you are in it for the workout: you will define your obliques beautifully.  I got Dolphina's dvds after I had my third baby and in one month I had a gorgeous defined belly that looked better than it it did when I was eighteen.

Her aim is to sculpt, more so than teach you to dance.  It is fun and gratifying.  If you are not lookijng for a serious workout or advanced choreography: You will definately enjoy it.",1144454400,2,2066,4.23469387755102
1776840,2,B00006IQA5,"I first purchased these videos to supplement the Turkish-Egyptian dance classes that I was taking. Right from the beginning, I was annoyed for a couple of different reasons: 1) ""Dolphina"" states that Rumi, a Persian poet, was Turkish, and 2) that Sufism, a mystical sect of Islam, was inspired by Rumi--when, in fact, Rumi was a Sufi. It was around long before him. All of this was stated in the beginning warm-up, and, from that point forward, I had difficulty taking the workout seriously.

Okay, okay--it's a workout, not a lesson in Near East history. However, after having studied Middle Eastern history and dance for many years, I found I was pretty consistently offended by Dolphina's statements, and thought her breathy commentary and seductive looks directed toward the camera obnoxious. Her cabaret dance costumes were a bit over the top. Her dance style is sloppy at best, her arm movements slack and uncontrolled. The ""Warrior Goddess"" workout has the potential to really injure the viewer, if they are not in good to great physical shape, or if they have any pre-existing back conditions.

That said, her warm-ups are well-thought out, and the music accompanying the lessons is gorgeous. Though Dolphina could use some lessons from a master of the dance, it can be a fun workout. However, beginners would be much better off taking lessons from a skilled dancer, so that the initial dance moves are learned well, in order to prevent injury, and to create a solid foundation for further dance learning. Middle Eastern dance is an exhilarating, empowering form of dance for women--have fun!",1144195200,3,1600,5.011278195488722
1776841,3,B00006IQA5,"This video is okay, but I spend more time giggling then actually doing the steps.

She is very spiritual and random. Like when she says ""plant your feet into the earth""....you mean the carpeting?? haha

I do think its a nice video, makes you feel sexy if you don't do it in front of a mirror....",1141862400,,295,4.25
1776842,5,B00006IQA5,"i really like the goddess workout set. dolphina clearly shows how to do the movements, the production value is good, nice sets, camera angles that show you exactly how to move your hips, hands, feet, etc. the music is great and if you don't ""get"" something right away, you can always rewind and practice it until you do. i like the moves that i learned from these dvds and whether someone else thinks they are traditional does not matter at all to me. bellydance, like yoga, can be many things to many people. as far as workout goes, i get a great ab workout from doing this bellydance routine and feel great afterward.
no one tape/dvd is going to be everything to every one. i like having a variety of workouts to choose from, it keeps me exercising every single day and that is what really matters.",1124928000,2,800,4.448979591836735
1776843,1,B00006IQA5,"Though Dolphina's persona is fabulous, the sets are beautiful, and outfits are great, this DVD can't give the viewer a clear understanding of how to do the steps being taught. Dolphina's instructions are good but she tends to rush from move to move, not giving you much time to comprehend and absorb the dance step. In addition, the camera direction is extremely distracting. For example, the camera tends to focus on Dolphina's face, when it should be focused on her body movements that pertain to learning the step. Also, the camera shot is pulled back much too wide in some scenes to include the beautiful backdrop, instead of a tighter shot on Dolphina's full body, so it's easier to see and follow her instruction.

On a postive note, the warm-up sessions are well done. Dolphina takes time to really get you into the mood to dance, both body and mind. I wish I could give this a better rating, becuase I do feel that Dolphina is a good instructor, but regrettably for anyone, much less a beginner, the poor camera-work interfers and overshadows the viewer's ability to understand and learn the steps easily.",1121990400,16,1113,4.766839378238342
1776844,5,B00006IQA5,"I began leading a group of women who are learning to belly dance through tapes (We don't exactly have access to instructors in Antarctica!)  Our group loves Dolphina's workouts.  Here are some of our comments...

Goddess workout:

Great instruction, however the camera has a tendancy to focus on parts that are not important for what you are learning at the time.  We love the costumes!

Warrior Goddess:

Much better camera work and a great ab workout.  We love the fact that she messes up at times and has the grace to keep going.  It really gives us some hope!

Veils:

Wonderful arm workout and she breaks down the moves to make them very easy to understand.

Zils:

I like that she sets the beats to phrases so that they are easy to remember.  I also found the beginning to be very informative and humorous.

Overall, the Goddess Workout set is great for beginners.  Unlike many videos, if you aren't ready for the next move she gives you an alternative so that you keep moving. Our group highly recommends it.",1117324800,5,1015,4.58659217877095
1776845,4,B00006IQA5,"I am fairly new to bellydance at the moment, and this was the first bellydance DVD (series) that I bought. I had the opportunity to actually meet Dolphina about a month ago at a workshop intensive, and I was really impressed with her level of expertise about the movements and the history of the dance, and how incredibly toned and feminine her body is. So, naturally, I thought that the Goddess series would be a good place to start.

For the most part, I have to agree with what the other reviewers have said. The sets are lovely, the costuming is beautiful, the music is peaceful and well suited to the dance steps that she teaches, etc etc. I don't find her costume changes to be distracting - I'm not watching the DVDs to construct my own bellywear. I did find that the camera work was not focused on the important parts of what was going on at times, for example - showing a closeup of her chest when she was explaining a hip circle. That made the movements harder to follow, but not impossible. And while I have to agree that the counts are off at times, I did notice that she didn't tend to get off of the beat unless she was talking about something, which does not make the errors necessarily forgiveable, but definitely understandable. Though the instruction is quite good, I don't think that I'd recommend this DVD series for someone who wanted to learn bellydance to learn bellydance, but I would definitely recommend them to someone who wanted to learn bellydance to incorporate something fun and effective into their fitness plan.",1114560000,4,1544,4.594202898550725
1776846,4,B00006IQA5,"First I saw the book in a local book store, I've been meaning to give it a try and promptly bought the book.  Then I decided to buy the video's.

After reading all the negative reviews I was really nervous about getting these ""bad"" video's.  Well I'm glad I did because I enjoy them.  The instuctor is hard to see sometimes in the first set but if your using this everyday you'll see and understand how to make the moves.  The book also helps.  I totally recomend buying the book with the video's.  The book illustrates better what the video dosn't.  I'm happy I bought this set.

Dolphina is a magical and an intoxicating lady.  She is trying to make a woman feel good about herself and the power of the human body that a woman has.  Hence ""The Goddess Workout"".  I think the most important lesson she tries to give everyone is that each individual is an incredible person and is special because of it.  I got a kick out of her jokes and her very freindly and personable nature.  I recommend this to start but definatly continue on! Enjoy and thank you Dolphina!",1109030400,,1063,4.384615384615385
1776847,3,B00006IQA5,"I should've known by the stiff cover photos, but I got suckered in by the whole ""Goddess"" thing.

Pros:  Beautiful teacher. Tranquil set. Very easy to watch as long as you don't pay too close attention.  Lovely costumes.  Relaxing.  Her dance sequences are interesting in that you see her dance to please herself, not the audience.

Cons:  Bad editing, and this makes her off-counting even worse 5.....6.....7..8.  totally disconnected.  Dolphina ""shows"" the viewer her style of dance,  she does not ""teach"".  She missed so many chances to teach proper technique, foot placement, muscle control, transitions, etc. She even missed several steps in her own choreography.  And yes, she is beautiful, but please show her feet when she's talking about feet.

Not a good choice for newbies to learn from, although it would get them interested in learning more.  Easy to watch. Easy to get bored and frustrated by.",1107216000,12,907,5.04054054054054
1776868,3,B00006IQA5,"I initally bought the DVD set because I wanted to learn more about veil and finger cymbal work and do not have access to classes, and getting the 4 pack was cheaper than buying individual DVDs. The production quality of the dvd was better than other bellydance instructional videos I own but I was not that impressed with Dolphina herself. I have been dancing for 5 years and may be biased, but I found her movements to be stiff, jerky, with little isolation between her lower and upper body (during the hips segment her head bounces has her hips move). While the choreographies at the end of the videos in theory have some decent combinations, Dolphina executes them poorly.

Overall there are some good ideas of moves from the videos, and I will mopst likely continue to use them to help me guide my own practices, but I do not recommend the Goddessworkout tapes. Instead I would recommend the DVDs from Jilliana or tapes from Suhalia.",1105056000,3,937,4.644578313253012
1776869,3,B00006IQA5,"I have all four Dolphina DVDs and as a long time dancer of many years, I can say they truly are the prettiest ones out there. The settings and such are lovely compared to many bellydance videos that look like someone filmed the teacher in her basement. Dolphina was actually the first bellydance video ""teacher"" I ever had and inspired me to study the art seriously!

The first one is by and far the prettiest, as other have said! I was a little disappointed that the format changed for the other three.

As far as actual teaching -- some interesting combinations are presented, but the filming does make it hard to learn. On the new ones she is often in shadow and you can't see exactly what she is doing. As others said, on the first one, the camera person is focusing on her face or belly or something and not showing the move at all sometimes! And occasionally Dolphina's isolations are off (for example, in some exercises she says to keep your chest and shoulders still while hers are clearly bobbing up and down.)

Still, I think for beginners or folks who just want to dabble with a different workout beyond aerobics, these DVDs will do the job. If you are an experienced dancer, go for the Jillina or Ansuya videos.

Dolphina DOES have a lovely presence on the screen. I wish she did a performance segement on each one the way many videos do!!! Perhaps she will later come out with a performance DVD of some kind -- she is so lovely to watch and her outfits are so pretty it would be bound to sell!",1104451200,2,1506,4.406474820143885
1776870,4,B00006IQA5,"So far, I have the beginner video, Warrior Goddess video and the Veils video.  She is an excellent teacher and these videos are motivational!  The first one is an excellent choice for these reasons - she is motivational, interesting, gently encouraging and you will feel sexy by the end of the workout!  I started this because I haven't been able to lose exra weight from having a baby over a year ago.  I have not felt sexy, just MOMMY!  Well, I was feeling so good after using this video, that I got the others and also signed up for a class in my town.  I go every week now and do the Goddess workouts in between.

I have the same complaint that many others have mentioned regarding the first video, though.  The camera work really is bad in parts of the video, but not throughout the whole video.  Mainly, it was during the ""Camel"" exercises and ""undulations"" at the end that they didn't really show what she was doing.  I consider these more advanced moves anyway, now that I am taking a class.  I think Dolphina didn't get into it much because of that reason.  She goes into it much more in the Warrior workout.

Her costumes in the first video kept my interest and intrigued me.  And to the person who said that they are not real belly dancing costumes - why would you say that?  They very much are!  I have done a ton of research since starting these workouts and real-life classes, so I know that there are all kinds of belly dancing styles out there - from the tribal style of Fat Chance Belly Dance to the caberet style to others.

As far as the Veena and Neena videos ... I was given one right after I had my baby and I found it a good workout, but boring!  They don't talk in the video and their outfits are boring!  In addition, I injured myself doing their workout, so I haven't really gone back.  Their personalities do NOT come through.  They might be good for their technical explanations - maybe? - but get the Goddess series to find the spiritual and beautiful side of the dance.

I also have the Rania workout video where she uses bellydance steps to Salsa and other latino music.  It is repetetive and boring, also.  It is produced by the same people that do the previously mentioned boring Veena and Neena videos.  However, there is a great bonus ab workout on the dvd and also two performances by Rania that are excellent, worth the price of the dvd.  She is more athletic than Dolphina, and I think less sensual, but has a ton of energy and is very accomplished.  Different styles, both entertaining and beautiful.  I just got the Rania video where she does 5 ten minute workouts using belly dancing moves and others to create quick workouts.  These are great if you have kids and not large blocks of time.

(I really don't like the way the Rania/Veena and Neena viedeos are produced! - with voice over, and the dancers looking here and there with no focus.  It's kind of weird.)

FWIW, you can go the the fatchancebellydance.com site and order their music and tapes.  I got their Tribaldance/Tribal drums cd because my teacher uses it for class, and it is great!  There is alot of good music out there, but I can recommend this one for sure.

On a website of belly dancers in Southern California, it said that Dolphina was saved by dolphins after a near-fatal boating accident in the West Indies.  I am guessing this is where she chose her stage name.  it is very common to take on a stage name, and even as a beginner, have chosen one for myself.

Everyone has a different learning style, so if sounds like something you would like, despite others criticisms, I say, ""Go for it!""  It's probably just right for you, then.",1103155200,4,3647,4.4352409638554215
1776871,5,B00006IQA5,"Dear Sister Goddesses,

 I only have the intro to bellydance DVD right now, but I just love it! I am getting the veils and cymbals DVD's.  And I am working on making my own costumes. Right now I wear a sarong when I do the DVD, but I want cool costumes, too! I find the DVD fun & I feel invigorated and sexy after doing my workout. And suprisingly, you sweat doing this! I love it & am actually excercising regularly because of it.  Thank you Dolphina, you are a Goddess!",1095379200,,471,4.142857142857143
1776872,3,B00006IQA5,"My daughter and I really enjoy Dolphina's style, enthusiasm, spirituality, encouragement and humor. However, the camera work is not good much of the time. As others have said, while she's demonstrating complex lower body moves, the camera is on her upper body and you have absolutely no idea what she's doing down below. She's wonderful, but she needs to find a new cameraperson.",1085270400,7,379,5.031746031746032
1776873,3,B00006IQA5,"Really this DVD set is mediocre at best- particularly the beginners video. The biggest gripe I have is the Camera work.  An exercise video should concentrate on the exercises being shown but half the time the camera is only looking at her face.  They did a wonderful job as far as scenery and costumes, but its all worthless if you can't see what or how you are suppose to be doing the moves.  Also, its more of an annoyance than anything, but she's really into the whole Chakra thing, I'm sure many people like to hear this stuff but personally I find it pretty Hippie Dippy, but what did I expect from someone named ""Dolphina"".  Aside from her granola personality, she seems to be a good instructor, if only she could adjust the camera person/director's chakras into making a practical bellydance video.",1082419200,9,805,4.647887323943662
1776874,5,B00006IQA5,"I bought Dolphina's warrior workout a few months ago out of curiosity and I developed a whole new hobby for myself. Since then I have bought Neena & Veena and also Rania's DVDs and videos. I like to watch and learn from all of them, each has a different style and each has taught me something else. I like Dolphina's warm & friendly attitude and elegance. I wish I could take her real life classes. Now I am waiting for the veil dance and cymbal dance DVDs. I make my own costumes and have great fun. I became stronger and developed some very nice curves. The only thing I have to work on some more is shimmy. I can only shimmy for a few minutes - I have yet to match Dolphina's stamina. The only thing that I would want to change about her DVDs is that sometimes they show her face and upper body rather than legs when she is doing hip and leg moves...so I cannot see how she is doing it. Other than that, she is my favorite belly dance teacher. Rania is a bit too tough and Neena and Veena do not break down their moves enough.",1080432000,5,1029,4.124378109452737
1776875,4,B00006IQA5,I've been dancing for a few years and had never tried bellydance before.  These DVD's made it easy to learn the art and beauty of bellydance.  I would recommend the Goddess workout to anyone with the desire to learn more about bellydance.  Dolphina is beautiful and her instruction is very well done.  The one thing I would have like more of would be detail in the footwork that goes along with some of the basic moves.,1080259200,2,419,4.473684210526316
1776876,1,B00006IQA5,"Learning how to dance from Dolphina is a challenge. First, she demonstrates moves improperly by not isolating them, which is the entire point of bellydance: isolation. It's not a bicycle hip if you use your whole body to do it. Sometimes she shows one move and then teaches another. For example, she shows what looks like a backwards hip figure 8, then teaches an upwards hip figure 8. Not only that, she teaches the move wrong so that it is harder to do! On one of her veil moves she teaches you to twist to look behind you and dip one arm down with the other up, and alternate. Then she shows the move and both arms are supposed to be at the same level throughout the move, not one down and one up. So again, she taught it wrong and the viewer has to figure it out on his/her own. While demonstrating moves, she tries to throw in other movements as well, such as wrist circles. Instead of looking graceful, she wriggles like a warm on a hook. Her arm movements themselves are stiff and awkward. If you don't know what a move is supposed to look like, she won't help.

In the finger cymbals video, she doesn't teach proper zil technique. Instead, she gives the viewer cheats by teaching them phrases to zil to. This isn't a problem if you want to flail around the house and make noise while chanting silly phrases to yourself. But if you really want to learn, this will make you worse off then when you started. You will not know how to play along to music, recognize middle eastern rhythms, or improvise your own rhythms to accentuate your dancing.

Dolphina's voice really bugs me. She sounds like she has no brains. She tries to impress the viewer by word dropping, talking about opening chakras and such.

Some reviewers say ""it's just for fun! Don't take it so seriously"". It's *supposed* to be an instructional video, not a silly fun-time learn nothing video. Instead it ends up being the later of the two. So, if you don't really care about learning to dance properly, and you would like a video that's silly and full of Hollywood flare, maybe this is for you. Or, if you thought (think?) bellydance is just for turning on men instead of a difficult and complex art form, I'm sure you will find this video fits your quick-fix needs. (PLEASE do not advertise this as real bellydance, because it makes us real dancers look bad) However, if you REALLY want to learn bellydance, this is NOT for you. Why learn bellydance from someone who can hardy do it? Find a teacher if you can. If not, Veena and Neena are better. You might also try Atea for basic moves, or Mesmera for finger cymbals.

1776877,3,B00006IQA5,"I didn't care for this DVD when I first bought it last year, but I've kept at it and I must say I do like Dolphina's spirituality. It annoyed me at first, but she really adds to the DVD and helps you get into it (which is an integral part for the mind to be involved as well). Plus she breaks down the moves and puts them all together, great for beginners.
As for the negative, the camera man STINKS!  When she is doing steps they focus on her face, you can't see anything! This doesn't happen once or twice, but frequently. It was (and still is) very frustrating.
In summary... spiritual, good explanation of moves, bad camera man loses you when learning!",1071187200,12,656,4.333333333333333

(The areas that I've spent the majority of my life are rural areas that frown upon things like Belly Dancing.) I recently bought the first  two DVD's in the set after renting the second video (The Warrior Goddess workout).  She teaches in a style that is different than most. She explains exactly where your hip[or insert moving body part name here] is going and breaks each move down into sections.  Granted there are costume changes & lavish scenery, but compared to some of the older videosby other performers, its a great improvement!! And at about $10 a DVD or video, your not really spending a fortune on the products. (some sets of 4 VHS are $140 or more!) Also, everyone needs to remember that there are several styles of belly dance out there & everyone has their own interpretation of what the dance should or should not be. All in all, if your looking for a basic practice video/DVD to workout with after your belly dance class (with a real live instructor) - this will work for you, especially if you work & have children - its short, sweet & to the point.",1069545600,15,1173,4.523584905660377

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so I am here to add mine to the mix. I have many bellydance videos and craved more: more variety, more bellydance moves, more fun, more bellydance and The Goddess Workout filled my needs. Dolphina has a great personality, and makes bellydance more fun, interesting and sexy than any other dancer/fitness instructor. All her comments, tips, and instruction fascinate and motivate me. She is very charming and makes me laugh( like shimmies can cause earthquakes - She is being playful people). I really do love her style and found it refreshing to see Bellydance be sexy, afterall, why would you want to do bellydancing if it wasn't sexy?(there are plenty of other workouts). I love Veena and Neena's videos because they are very good instructional videos, but they are not sexy at all. Another great aspect to The Goddess Workout videos is she teaches a wide variety of bellydance moves, moves I didn't see in other videos, especially the Finger Cymbals, Veils and Warrior Goddess. Most people have already mentioned, Dolphina's sets and costumes are superior to all others.",1057190400,5,1216,4.965686274509804
1776881,3,B00006IQA5,"I have been learning how to belly dance for the past several months, and I thought this series would build upon the classes and workshops I had already taken.  I was disappointed.  The moves she teaches are not traditional, and she goes beyond my comfort zone with her new-agey lectures as she dances.  Shimmies can cause earthquakes?  Please.  There are also many times when you can't see what she's doing because the camera focuses on her face too much.  I greatly prefer the Neena and Veena tapes that I own.  I think I'll sell these and get Delilah's videos instead.",1057017600,3,570,4.64
1776882,1,B00006IQA5,"As for the Goddess workout for beginners yes the scenery is breath taking and music is beautiful but that alone will not teach someone how to Belly dance. I really regret buying these DVDS, I truly do! The choreography in the DVD is so bad that half the time I don't know if I am coming or going. She does not do the move long enough for you to learn it she is way to fast almost as if she really does not want to be there. Yes she has a beautiful ""midriff"" but do they have to show it every 2 seconds. If I am trying to learn a leg move I don't want to see her belly on the screen I want to see her legs  from what ever I can see this would be because the customs she wears. Yes they are wonderful but sadly you can hardly see what she is doing in her leg, hip and feet area. Your clueless as to what she is doing. As for the Warrior Goddess the scenery is boring the custom is a bit better  as far as seeing what she is doing as in the first DVD she goes to fast and does not do the move enough for you to learn it. The cool down in Warrior Goddess is a 1-minute cool down that is so tacky it is sad. DONT BUY THESE ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!",1051833600,12,1145,3.7468879668049793
1776883,3,B00006IQA5,"Wow, I did get a great workout from the video.  I have to say it was a lot more challenging than I expected, but I totally agree with the other people who said it was difficult to follow.  For an intro to bellydance, they focus a lot on her face, not on her whole body; there were times I could not figure out what I was suppose to do (were my knees bent?  Was I stepping forward? How was I suppose to step forward?  What was she doing with her arms?)  A different camera angle is all I need to completely love it, though.  I think they are tremendous fun!

Edit:  I purchased Veena and Neena's ""Discover Bellydance"" set and found that it really helped with the basics of understanding what I was supposed to be doing.  For more advanced moves, the ""Warrior Goddess"" and ""Finger Cymbals"" definitely cover areas that other instructional tapes don't.  If you're advanced, you probably won't have any trouble with the beginning DVDs, and enjoy the whole set.  If you're a bellydance beginner, I'd recommend purchasing ""Discover Bellydance"" to start and  Dolphina's ""Warrior Goddess"" and ""Finger Cymbals"" separately.",1050537600,24,1112,4.704663212435233
1776884,5,B00006IQA5,"""The Goddess Workout"" is the only workout I've done so many times that I've memorized the whole routine, and I can do it without the video.

I loved it from the first time I did it.  I showed three friends the video at my house, and they all went out and bought it.

""The Warrior Goddess"" is more difficult, I tried too hard the first time I did it and hurt my hip.  If you are a beginner, you should definitely do the ""Goddess Workout"" first, then try the ""Warrior Goddess"".

I haven't really done the whole zills (finger cymbals) routine, but the way she teaches it makes it fun and easy to learn.

The veil workout gives a good arm workout.

All in all, I love all her workouts, because it feels magical and when you're done and you've mastered the moves, you feel like a goddess, or at least like a bellydancer.

I'm not an expert bellydancer, so I can't tell you if the moves she's teaching are perfect, but I can tell you that these are the most fun and motivational videos I've tried.

Some people complain that she talks about shakras or about how many times she changes her costume in  the 1st DVD, but I don't think either of these affected the workout.  In fact, I recently got a hip scarf with coins, and I liked the segments when she had the coined outfits, so I could hear if my movements matched hers.",1046908800,49,1316,4.266129032258065
1776885,5,B00006IQA5,"I am an avid exerciser doing a combination of routines, this is the first time I have ever been exposed to belly dancing!! I purchased this video after developing an interest and reading the earlier reviews. I recieved the video today immedialtly did the introduction to belly dancing dvd, it was easy to follow for me as a beginner and a truely invigorating work out!! I felt fabulous afterward!! I am very pleased that this package comes with other workouts to add variety and to have a goal to work towards!! This is well packaged and performed.  I have done all the DVD's except the Advanced and really get a great workout from all of them!! They are very positive and inspirational as well as informative.  This is a great package!!",1046131200,12,737,4.6183206106870225
7969307,5,B00006IQA5,"I really enjoy Dolphina's workouts. This set is great. I had tried the first two disks from the local library but haven't watched the ones on cymbals or veils yet. I'm sure they will be excellent, as her other DVDs are.",1367280000,,219,4.365853658536586
7969308,3,B00006IQA5,This series is lots of fun. I recommend starting with the easiest and working your way up only after you have the previous video down. Otherwise you will get a little lost later on.,1228608000,,181,4.352941176470588
7969309,1,B00006IQA5,"Dolphina is stereotype that every belly dancer fights against. There are so many better dvds out there that break down instruction showing the body part being used.  A qualified teacher would use correct terminology and not degrade the dance by focusing on t&a.  The dance is about sensuality, not sex.  If you want a plus, the music on her beginning dvd is good and as said, the sets are beautiful.",1217808000,,399,4.671428571428572
7969310,1,B00006IQA5,"She is encouraging, but doesn't break down the moves or give you enough time to master them before she has you doing a ""double time"" pace dance. The camera man is shooting her face while she is trying to teach you how to do foot work...very frustrating. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the set.",1186531200,,308,4.237288135593221
7969311,5,B00006IQA5,"I originally bought the intro to belly dance on vhs tape, a long time ago.  I decided to get the set, because it was economical, and I thought a great way to keep dancing while I live in another country.  The set is lovely, well thought out, and a great excersise.  I find Dolphina to be classy, elegant, and encouraging. She encourages all women to see themselves as the Goddess and to find that inner peace and strength that we all need in our daily lives.  Also a great stress reducer!  I use the two dance workouts every other day, and in between I work with veils and finger cymbals.  These are not my only dance videos, but they are the ones I return to again and again.  If you want the sensual side of belly dance, these are the DVDs for you.",1176163200,,750,4.2027972027972025
7969312,4,B00006IQA5,"I really liked these dvds, I did notice that the person taping the workouts should have did a lot better, because Dolphina would be working on one part of the body and the camera would be on a different part of the body that wasn't even working out...The finger cymbals dvd could have had a lot more rythyms, and I would highly suggest Ansuya's dvd for finger cymbals if you would like to explore more into the finger cymbals...if you would like to try out the dvds, I would recommend you watching them through first and then trying them out, especially if you are a beginner. I do like the dvds though, and they are taped in beautiful locations. When I tried the introduction to bellydance dvd, even though I have been bellydancing for about 4-5 years now, I actually felt like I worked out. I would also recommend anything from Jillina, Ansuya, Bellydance Superstars, Neena and Veena...I have a lot more to recommend, but if you look around you will find things you like...",1175040000,,975,4.577142857142857
7969313,5,B00006IQA5,One of my dance instructors recommended the Goddess Workout DVD's for practice at home. Dolphina makes it easy and fun. I was having trouble with zils and Dolphina's instruction is helping me alot! I have recommended this series to several of my dance mates.,1169856000,,258,4.886363636363637
7969314,4,B00006IQA5,"OK, if you're looking for a quick class in Eastern religions, you probably want your local community college. If you want to be a real belly dancer, again you might want to go to an actual class. However, if you want to engage in a beautiful workout that is definitely different than anything you'll take at your local Bali gym, this is pretty darn good. There is a little showmanship involved, and some metaphysical discussion. (I mean it IS supposed to be a Goddess workout. There it is - a religious word right in the title, folks. No excuse for any confusion here.) For a GODDESS workout it sets up a beautiful environment and teaches some lovely, feminine moves. It also works up a sweat! Dolphina (ok, like that's her REAL name) takes you through the movements very well. I'm accustomed to getting bored with the plodding pace of most videos, but this one moves pretty quickly and kept me pleasantly busy. However, Dolphina doesn't make you feel inadequate if you can't keep up with everything right away. By the second time I did the video I pretty much kept up. It might even have been better if I had watched it once through first, but I was too eager to get started with this one. Listen people, if you have an easy time keeping up with a workout involving dance on your first try, you aren't really doing or learning anything! If you're seriously out of shape, start with something like pilates to achieve basic tone and flexibility, then move up to this. It takes some coordination and fitness to start, but it's loads of fun and leaves you feeling both feminine and exhausted - a perfect workout!

Edit: I thought it might be helpful to add that I tend to tire quickly of exercise vids, but I find myself craving this workout. Most of the time I have to set reminders and drag myself groaning from my desk, but I actually find myself thinking during the day, ""I wonder if I'll have time to do my bellydance video today?"" It's a keeper. However, I do want to agree with the person who said the camera focuses on her face in a few key moments. It  won't keep you from learning overall, but it certainly is annoying the first couple of times when you're just picking up the moves.",1158710400,3,2190,4.4725
7969315,1,B00006IQA5,"I am a bellydance student and maybe that is why I hate these videos. I thought I'd just pick them up to use at home to expand my dancing, but the way she ""teaches"" stinks! She barely explains anything new before you move right into a choreographed dance lesson. Especially the Zills choreography. Ugh, I can't even imagine I'll use them again. Hope someone enjoyed them.",1154390400,3,370,4.621212121212121
7969316,5,B00006IQA5,Dolphina is a very good teacher!  I just started these videos and have been able to get the moves down really well because she starts out slow and describes each movement with detail.  I also feel like I am getting a really good workout.  I would highly recomend this video set to anyone who wants to learn belly dance and get a good workout at the same time.,1145923200,,359,4.25
