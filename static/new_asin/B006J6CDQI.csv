4992802,1,B006J6CDQI,"Classic horror flick done wrong! I would expect a better (MUCH BETTER) transfer & quality from Full Moon. I also would be embarrassed to release this title the way Full Moon has chosen to do so. This is obviously a VHS to DVD transfer without ANY mastering or color correction. Foggy, blurry, glitches, color fade (washed out) to name a few. My VHS copy is far superior than this edition of DREAMANIAC on DVD. No professional time was given for this title and that's pretty sad because I really like this 80's gem & a lot of Full Moon releases, but if this is what FULL MOON is going to give us, then i will not be purchasing ANY other titles from Full Moon. If you own the original VHS, keep it or make yourself a backup copy because it's probably better than this shoddy transfer. This is not worth the asking price or shipping fee. FULL MOON, why would you release this classic title without ANY RE-MASTERING & why would you let loyal followers down in such a big way? Fans, do yourself a favor and pass on this DVD edition of DREAMANIAC, it was a nightmare watching this jacked up transfer. Schroeder (Cult Movies Magazine)",1333670400,15,1127,4.449275362318841
8499235,5,B006J6CDQI,"I thought this movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it. I like most stuff that Charles Band and Full Moon put out though. Pretty rough quality picture, but that is expected with an old grindhouse release. Recommended for anyone who is into obscure slasher flicks from the 80's.",1528934400,,282,4.775510204081633
8499236,3,B006J6CDQI,So I am not upset about the quality. Because I already read that quality with lots of great. However the looby is okay it's overall slow.,1517702400,,137,4.3076923076923075

8499243,2,B006J6CDQI,This is a bad 80's movie in the first place and i didn't expect much when i ordered it so i wasn't disappointed. The master for this film is a vhs cassette and that is how it looks but still ok and watchable.,1382140800,4,208,3.86046511627907
8499244,1,B006J6CDQI,"""In the sleep-stirring tradition of Phantasm and A Nightmare On Elm Street, Dreamaniac introduces Lily, a deadly leading lady who makes Freddy look like a bargain basement boogeyman!"" Whoever wrote this editorial review needs to be dragged into the street and have an elephant turd soaked in sulfuric acid shot into their face with a bazooka.

This film drags more butt than a thousand dogs with itchy anuses.
The sound mix is horrible on the copy I saw as well. (Netflix)

I first thought this was a rip off of A Nightmare on Elm Street mainly because the killer on the cover is coming out of the wall like Freddy did in the first film. Also because of the misleading title. I also thought that the image on the cover was Clint Howard until I saw the bigger image, and I'm not sure why they show the killer being bald; SHE isn't.

They love to show nudity in this film. I personally don't like nudity in films, but even I can tell when it's forced.

The ending makes no sense at all: the killer succubus was an escapee from a mental home, and was told to apologize(?). Then we learn it was all a script / novel. We see the writer talking to his publisher on the phone about what the title should be. They decide on ""Succubus"" (which could have be the original title for this movie; certainly makes more sense than ""Dreamaniac""). The writer then gets a knock on the door; he opens it, and a woman cuts his throat.

This film will only serve to confuse you and bore you to death. Don't waste your time.",1352678400,,1501,4.365591397849462
