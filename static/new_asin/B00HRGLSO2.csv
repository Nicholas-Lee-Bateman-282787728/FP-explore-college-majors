8634794,4,B00HRGLSO2,"I really like this series.  It's good at blending between the comedy and drama/romance.  I would recommend this series to be people who like a good romance story with well placed humor, and don't mind the creepy crawlers, a.k.a. insects. The other nice thing about this series is that the science is more then just a backdrop for the setting but feels very much apart of it, and reveals truths of the human nature.",1416009600,,414,4.581081081081081
