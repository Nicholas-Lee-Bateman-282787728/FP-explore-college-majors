The tours of the film sites very interesting.  The book that accompanies it is also very good....it's a great companion to watching the series.  Although I watched the whole Morse series when it was shown on tv in UK, I've since bought all the dvd's so I can watch again and again, as not only do I love the series and actors, as I lived in the area it was set I can look at Oxford when ever I want, through the dvds of the series and now this first class dvd of the making of the series. Thank you.",1463011200,,659,3.9696969696969697

8161526,3,B000LC5B10,"The description of this item did not say that the book, ""The Oxford of Inspector Morse""  came with it so I purchased this book from another seller who is in the UK and thus it is too expensive to return the book to the UK .  So I have two copies of the book.  Not happy.",1391817600,,270,3.7857142857142856
8161527,4,B000LC5B10,"This is a 50 minute amalgam of interviews, together with outtakes from the TV series, compiled after the last Inspector Morse series was filmed and aired in 1993. John Thaw wanted to move on, and everybody knew that Series 7 was the last series (BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons"").  However, in ""The Making of Morse"", John Thaw does admit that though he won't do another Inspector Morse series, he's not saying there won't be any more Morse in one form or another. And, to our joy, he did afterwards film five annual Specials, which aired between 1995 and 2000.

Don't confuse this ""The Making of Morse"" with ""The Story of Morse"". Both are 50 minute documentary specials produced in England. And both came from the same time period. I think what happened is that in 1993 or so, they compiled enough interviews that they had enough to make two documentaries instead of one.

I have both ""The Making..."" and ""The Story..."". Though made at the same time, the two 50 minute documentary specials do not have the same clips, so they compliment each other, rather than repeat each other.

""The Story of Morse"" is not, as far as I know, available separately on DVD. Rather, it is the extra disc on the sixth and last of the Inspector Morse Collection Sets,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-Remorseful-Day-Collection-Set/dp/B000BF0DGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse: Remorseful Day - Collection Set</a>.

I enjoy watching ""The Making of Morse"". In the beginning, John Thaw talks about when he was approached for this new series. Producer Kenny McBain told him, ""we were doing films about a man called Morse. We weren't doing murders. It's actually a series of films about this man, principally. ... We must see the murders and the aftermath from his point of view.""

I think the series does just that, because I really enjoy ""Inspector Morse"" as the story of Morse: Morse and Lewis, Morse and Strange, Morse and his nemeses, Morse and his flutters of the heart.

I also very much enjoyed the interviews about the music, both the ""Inspector Morse"" theme and the incidental music. Both are superb, and you get a bit of a look at how they compose the music effects to go with each scene.

I bought this ""Inspector Morse: The Making of Morse"" in 2007 from amazon. It has the same DVD case cover as is shown on this page. However, it has only one DVD disc, while, at the time I write this, the amazon page states that it has two discs. I would be very interested in hearing from someone who's ordered this more recently. How many discs are included and if there's two, what is on the second. I certainly would want to correct my review if ""The Making of Morse"" has changed, but I don't want to buy a duplicate copy to find out, either! (I've found it on sale at three other websites: one says it's 1 disc, two say it's 2 discs, but none have any actual information!) OR, ""The Making of Morse"" used to be part of a small book/DVD combo - maybe it's the book shown in back of the DVD case illustrating this amazon page.

The review above is going by what I have on my shelf, a single disc of ""Inspector Morse: The Making of Morse"". It is great fun to watch for an Inspector Morse fan.

Happy Reader",1337558400,4,3296,4.786971830985915
8161528,4,B000LC5B10,"Don't miss this 50-minute special on the ""Making of Inspector Morse"" if you are a serious fan of the TV series based on the characters by Colin Dexter. Interviews with the actors playing major characters, along with others involved in the series, give a ""human touch"" to the series, providing the viewer with an inside look at how all these people regard their work. John Thaw, who plays Morse, believes that he would have been ""frightened"" by Morse in real life--because Morse is so clever and knows it. Kevin Whatley, who plays Sgt. Lewis, comments on the father-son relationship with Inspector Morse, and a real police inspector and a former convict give their take on the action and how realistic Morse may be.

Running through the video are scenes from a ""Morse tour,"" a bus tour of the Oxford locations used in many of the Morse shows, including a visit to the home used for the action in the first Morse episode, ""The Dead of Jericho."" The woman who narrates the tour and her clients, all of whom are ""just folks,"" reflect the impact of this series, which was reportedly seen by 750 million viewers in fifty countries. Of particular interest here is the (too short) interview with the music director, Barrington Pheloung, who uses the Morse code rhythm for the word ""Morse"" in the main theme song. Pheloung also admits that he sometimes buried the Morse-coded names of killers within the music of the episodes.

Lots of fun for fans of the series, this video draws connections and answers questions, and when Colin Dexter, author of the books, comments on the fact that most of the dialogue from his books had to be cut or changed for the TV series, his good humor is contagious.  A delightful inside look at a favorite series, this DVD gives warmth and a personal touch to the characters and settings. n Mary Whipple
