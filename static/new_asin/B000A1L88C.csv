8072201,3,B000A1L88C,"In Death in Brunswick Sam Neill plays a cook who's having a particularly bad week - his mother's moved in for a visit, he's got on the wrong side of his new boss's psychotic minder and he accidentally kills his kitchen helper. What may look on the surface to be another disposing of the body comedy (just what the world needs) in fact goes off in various weird and sometimes wonderful directions, constantly catching you off guard. Certainly tasteless (the cockroach anchovies on a pizza are one of the minor outrages) but never disgusting, although it's not laugh-a-minute it is very funny in its details and it works because the characters are there. With Neil and John Clarke's long-suffering best friend a great double-act, it's definitely a diamond in the rough.

Despite the box's promise of a trailer there are no extras on the UK PAL DVD (for those you need to pick up the Australian special edition DVD), but the fullframe transfer is acceptable.",1202860800,,955,4.787878787878788
