8492407,5,B006473X7K,I thought this was a funny & dramatic show to watch. The english subtitles were good until the final two episodes. I couldn't stop watching this until I hit the end of the series.,1376784000,,179,4.294117647058823

8492409,4,B006473X7K,"I quite enjoyed this. It's super fun and very similar to the manga/anime so it was great to see it brought into live action.
As usual with these, the sub titles in the last few episodes where intelligible, but that's something recurring viewers have come to expect these day's, I suppose.",1364515200,,288,4.666666666666667
8492410,5,B006473X7K,"I was so dissppointed when youtube took this off. I didn't even get to finish it. Now that its on Amazon I can get it and watch it while I'm in my college dorm. I loved the Anime and the manga I'm so, so, so, happy about the live action. And for people who have never watched a anime or a manga be become a live action, you need to shut up. I have been waiting for this for years and I am a BIG fan to the Host Club Boys. And not everything is going to be exact. Even the hair,and other small things that you should not be making a big deal out of. I didn't think the actor who played in Hana Kim could do Tohma, but I was proved wrong and enjoyed every last bit that I could before youtube took it off. Once I am paid I am going to get this. I'll have this and my Host club anime. Its going to a good year XD",1344729600,,809,3.7093023255813953
8492411,3,B006473X7K,"Jeeze somany things wrong with the cover, & i think haruhi is being playd by a boy, i can't tell which one is haruhi which one is the twins they all look like family, wheres tamakey he's blond the twins are supose to be red heads, this is all wrong they look emo dark, the characters are supose to be cute vibrant characters, these people look sad one of them is covering his beutiful face with his hair, they'd never do that no no this can't be good but turning these cartoons into human characters never really do well. look at street fighter, and i never really liked initial D's movie. let i mind you this is just a review of the cover but the motions and action in this movie are identical to the cartoon.",1339459200,,710,4.227941176470588
8492412,3,B006473X7K,"I purchased this in late December because I am a huge fan of the anime and thought this would be amazing.  Though the characters hold true to the manga/anime, one thing that I did not know is that this is a Fan-Sub.  It starts out saying it's subbed by Serendipity fan subs then gets changed to something else right around the second disc.  There is also a big change in the quality of fan subbing.  At first it starts out small like a missing letter, a missing word, an incomplete sentence, but there were even at least one unsubbed line and on disc 2, close to the end, Haruhi (the female lead) gets called Chun Fei by Kyoya supposedly in the subtitles.  That was it for me.  I'd much rather watch without the subs and just guess what's going on because it would be fairly easy to figure it out if  you've seen the anime.  I spent close to $30for this, and while I do not completely regret it, I recommend you look for a bit, as also I believe this was a burnt copy of free fan-subs off of the internet.",1326412800,13,1005,4.197916666666667
