2953331,5,B000VT6ZUE,Met all my requirements and expectations.  One of the best products out there for the cost and expectations for use.,1364169600,,116,4.8
2953332,4,B000VT6ZUE,"I haven't watched the whole movie yet, but  I really like it. Movies like this are my favorite to watch on a cold winter's night with popcorn and my feet up!",1360540800,,157,4.064516129032258
2953333,5,B000VT6ZUE,I have bought several DVDs on line through Amazon and the descriptions of the movies are very accurate.  They always arrive quickly and in very good condition.  Only one time did I have to return a movie but that was a simple error of witch area the movie could be played in.  The one I received was only for Great Britain but the seller was able to refund my money as soon as I returned the item.  Unfortunately he didn't have another one but I was able to find one on Amazon.  It's great to be able to buy older movies through Amazon and their sellers.,1349568000,2,554,4.188679245283019
2953334,3,B000VT6ZUE,"This movie started out really good, the storyline was interesting and it had promise. Kelly Martin did a great job in her part. As the movie went on there were several obvious mistakes that made it seem silly. After the two women are attacked and escape to the RV with no belongings, all of a sudden the next day they both have brand new fashionable outfits on. And where exactly did those come from?

The plot becomes more and more predictable as the movie goes on, and Kelly Martin's character ends up disappointing with her extreme stupidity toward the end. She spends the whole movie being smart and making good decisions, and then once she talks to her husband again she apparantly loses her capacity to think. If the end had not ended up being so predictable and silly this may have been a good film.",1317427200,3,806,4.52054794520548
2953335,4,B000VT6ZUE,Pretty good film all in all though perhaps a little predictable. The acting is excellent though and not a movie you'll regret watching if you don't go in expecting a blockbuster.,1245369600,5,178,4.774193548387097
