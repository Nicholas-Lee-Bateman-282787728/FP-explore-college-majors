8103393,5,B000E0OE1C,"This is a fabulous collection - the best of the best by the BBC Drama Collection. I was unfamiliar with many of the stories when I bought the collection but have seen most of them now. (I've only had the collection a week!) I have fallen in love with the characters of ""Wives & Daughters"" and ""Middlemarch"".  If you enjoyed the BBC version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" and felt that it surpassed the recent release starring Keira Knightly, then you will not be disappointed with this collection.  I highly recommend this collection to your DVD library!",1194998400,12,546,4.677083333333333
