1854990,5,B00008NNPK,"This is a very good movie that shows the arrogance of the world powers by thinking that third world countries will be better off if they are introduced to world trade and new technology. It is a microcosm for many other third-world countries. Schumacher was talking about this some 30 years ago with his book ""Small is beautiful,"" which is a must read.

The one thing that I see about this movie is Jamaica's possible resemblance to the United States 30 or 40 years down the line. Right now, labor intensive jobs are being exported to China, small farms and ranches are almost non-existent, we are in debt up to our wazoo, the value of our dollar is seriously decreasing, our prison system is overflowing, inner city violence is as bad as ever, we have no culture of our own, etc etc.

Peter Peterson's ""Running on Empty"" is a good read as well...",1102291200,,847,4.529411764705882
1854991,4,B00008NNPK,"I was shown this film a few weeks before I went to Jamaica over spring break to do volunteer work.  It prepared me for what I was going to see in person in a way I hadn't expected.  In addition, it made me  understand that the work we would be doing -- building houses in a small, impoverished village -- was just a small part of the bigger picture.  The bigger picture is what the film shows -- how globalization, the IMF and corporate greed have all played a part in destroying a nation's economy.

For those who feel that the film's portrayal of tourists is unfair, take a trip away from the beaches to where the film goes. The Kingston Free Zone, small villages where the residents live and work in shacks, etc.  And the one place where the movie didn't go, at least not in my recollection -- the ""poor house"", where the sickest, oldest, and most impoverished citizens go-- but only after proving all of the above so that they can spend their time crawling or walking around in nothing more than a shirt. Then maybe you'll understand why the fimmaker has such a hard time understanding how people can spend $$ for a ""bargain vacation"" while people are suffering and breaking their backs just to put food on the table a few miles away.

This is a must see for anyone who is going to Jamaica, be it for a vacation or a mission. Please, don't allow yourself to live in ignorance.",1100476800,9,1380,4.3671875
1854992,5,B00008NNPK,"One of the bonus tracks on the DVD is a music video, ""Mr. Heartless"" by Anthony B. with kids, garbage trucks, cows roaming near a dump, the singer, and the kids playing violin look very young for that part.  They sound great though, and the movie is basically educational in a manner that fits with a song that ends with the exhortation:  Rastafari.  Listening to the commentary by the directer, she seemed to be a little shy about things that she could not come right out and say in the film.  She set up a camera by three men with a Bible sitting in front of a fire and cuts their comments into the film almost as much as the tourists, but in the end she admits that tourism is the number one industry in the global economy.

The really dirty secret that she spills the beans on, that none of the farmers actually say in the film, is that whenever a farmer tries to send something into the United States, it is held in Customs until it utterly perishes.  I have been reading about a few trade imbalances, and I'm inclined to believe that powdered milk which appears in this film is subsidized at 137 percent of its price, as is stated in the film in the regular soundtrack.

I really wish that the fresh milk shown in this film could have been sold to Asian workers in the Kingston free zone, but they would not receive any money until they returned to their homes in Asia.  Whoever has really big bucks is going to extreme lengths to keep real money from reaching regular people, and I no longer think that Americans are heading into the future with any wind at their backs.  Debt is the biggest problem Jamaica faces as a deteriorating society, growing astronomically with each new year, but American policies of budget deficits, trade imbalances, and gross family financial incompetence throughout the middle class could make the negative net worth of the United States surpass anything the world has ever seen, particularly when the newspapers aren't reporting what Harvey Pitt has been doing since he was chairman of the S.E.C.  Do yourself a favor and watch the video a few times, but be sure to see the movie, interview, and commentary, too.  Credits at the end include some foundations set up by the world's smartest billionaires, so don't think this movie is all bad, however much real money you think your stock is worth.",1093651200,5,2333,4.557416267942584
1854993,5,B00008NNPK,"The other reviews here are elegant, and I'll ask you to trust them when they urge you to see and support the film.  I will add, however, that it's strikingly clear we're witnessing a new era of slavery and servitude here, one that is less direct yet equally immoral.  The argument that some critics have posted, stating that Jamaica's problems could be solved by a better tourism industry, is akin to contending that a violated woman ought to ""pretty herself up and enjoy it more.""  Before we offer suggestions, maybe we should first put ourselves in her shoes - and that's what this film gives us a chance to do.  And I'm indebted.",1087516800,11,632,4.566371681415929
1854994,2,B00008NNPK,"I should first explain that I had very high expectations for this movie, thinking it would make a good case for how free markets and globalization can sometimes destroy peoples lives in a merciless fashion. This movie was aimed only at trying to elicit anger at corporate greed, or at the IMF, but fails miserably in examining the root causes of Jamaica's problems.
Where it succeeds: I was shocked at how high the interest rates collected by the IMF/World Bank are. I would have thought they would be on a par with an American ""student loan""...! Also, the going-ons in the Free-trade zone certainly showed the dark side of corporate greed, and outlandish abuse of basic human rights of workers... For these, the movie gets 2 stars.
Where it fails: Attempting to make tourists seem as uncaring, selfish, and self-absorbed, surely will not help the much needed tourist industry in Jamaica. Why shouldn't a tourist desire a trouble-free, guilt-free, and relaxing vacation? But, more importantly, did not do a good job of proving or even examining whether the industries affected by globalization are industries in which Jamaica WOULD enjoy a competitive advantage, given better fiscal policy or less restrictive conditions by the IMF and the World Bank.
The film never answers what any sensible viewer might ask themselves: Why can't Jamaica develop a similar tourist economy, such as those present in Hawaii and Tahiti, which enjoy much higher standards of living, despite being further isolated, and also having to pay high prices to import most goods? If they are very different, how so? How could this difference be used to an advantage?",1085270400,15,1639,5.029411764705882
1854995,5,B00008NNPK,"I'm a volunteer in Jamaica, and whenever anyone questions the value of development work in Jamaica ('beaches, ganja, reggae...'), I show them this film.  I also can vouch for many of the opinions presented as accurate depictions of the realities of the impact of the IMF loans and globalization on the island.
The extra features are especially valuable, letting the viewer get much of the information that is lost on those who aren't familiar with Jamaica beyond the confines of the resorts.
It should be a must-see for anyone visiting 'on vacation'",1076889600,7,549,4.967391304347826
1854996,3,B00008NNPK,"The film does well contrasting the Jamaica of the resorts with the Jamaica of its people.  Within the faux atmosphere of the resorts, all is paradise.  But within the country itself, the people suffer extreme poverty and hardship, principally the result of US neocolonial trade practices with Jamaica and the draconian economic policies of the IMF.  In this respect, the film stays on message.
But this is the only message in the film, and it repeats it endlessly in ways that do not create novel applications of the message.  Some interviews are simply too long; others seem redundant.  Although I am sympathetic to message of the film, I found myself saying, ""Okay, I get it already.""
The sound track was wonderful.  I also appreciated how the filmmakers had many ordinary Jamaicans describe the effects of neocolonial trade practices on their lives as well as the experts.",1064793600,19,875,4.958904109589041
1854997,5,B00008NNPK,"This is an extremely poignant view of how our thirst for luxury puts the majority of the world at our whim, making them our invisible slaves.  The people who sew our shirts, pick our bananas, and make our shoes are caught in a vicious cycle that keeps them bent to our oppression.  It is something we never see -- and because of that, we never care.  In this film we are forced to look at things we've never been told about and to understand the reasons and events behind our global poverty crisis.  This is a fantastic film for youth groups and it sparks great discussion.  Every highschooler should be required to view this in their economics class.  Every adult should be required to view this before they decide to take an all-inclusive vacation.  This IS the real Cancun -- ahem, Jamaica.  We need to learn that our decisions as consumers and as a country affect the lives of millions of people, and that we, as consumers, could make those lives better by choosing to live differently.  This film can do that, and it is absolutely required viewing for all first world citizens.",1052784000,30,1082,4.564766839378239

Aware of the poverty in Mexico.  (from the Hwy you see little, falling apart shacks next to ""3 car garagers"")  The starling Jamaican poverty was too painful to bear.  Scenes of resort vacationers beside impoverished Jamaican citizens...  As always, always, always the white fat cats justifying it all.  After all, it's of Jamaica's own making...farmers refusing to go along w/the program & all.  Started me wondering again about all the ""exotic"" foreign produce sold here.  Watching all that milk being poured out made me shudder - SO many children in SO many countries desperately needing milk...Good thing we can afford $7.00 a gallon (won't mention the store name).

1855030,5,B00008NNPK,"This is a gorgeous and hauntingly beautiful film, but its message will haunt you as well.  Set against a reggae soundtrack, it explores how international lending institutions (especially the International Monetary Fund and World Bank) have in effect prevented Jamaica from becoming a sovereign country.  The story of how these institutions impose Structural Adjustment policies that prevent countries from spending public resources on public needs is one that could be told in many places around the world.  Jamaica long ago repaid the principal of the loans it contracted in the 1970s and 80s, but now owes the IMF more than $9 billion in interest. While the country's coffers are raided for interest repayments, health clinics are closed and schools go without equipment or even electricity -- the country hasn't even built a new hospital since the early 70s.  A corollary of IMF dictates that countries such as Jamaica devote as many of their hard currency revenues to repaying foreign debt is that they must open their economies to foreign agricultural and manufactured goods that destroy local industries. The sight of dairy farmers selling their herds for hamburger because they can't compete with subsidized dried milk from the US is one of many painful and poignant scenes from the film. I use this film with great effect in my college classes, but it is powerful viewing in or out of the classroom.",1373068800,,1407,5.077922077922078

If you live in a country that has to follow the rules made by the big boys, your country's economy could collapse under globalization unless the system is changed. But don't count on it: the rich guys who run the global economy could care less about the poor countries and their people. They want the workers in the poor countries to work for free.

I agree with other negative reviews on this film in that Ms. Black has an agenda and that agenda is making capitalism and colonialism out to look evil when really it appears that socialism contributed heavily to Jamaica's economic downfall.  And it's quite silly of Ms. Black to put down tourists who contribute their hard-earned dollars to Jamaica's economy.  After all, Jamaica relies heavily on tourist dollars.

1855052,5,B00008NNPK,"I just watched it.  To get a $50,000,000 loan, Jamaica had to agree to relinquish the right to control imports in any way.  So American powdered milk subsidized 137% undercuts fresh milk produced in Jamaica(even though powdered milk is more expensive to produce), destroying the dairy industry.  How could politicians agree to something like that?  Were they in somebody's pocket?  Was the country that desperate?  The film doesn't shed much light on that aspect, focusing instead on the results these agreements have on ordinary (poor) Jamaicans.  But it's well worth seeing.  Many ordinary people appear on film and the impact is palpable.  It's a bit heavy handed on the filming of the tourists but it's effective.

It begins by insulting would-be tourists insinuating they have no idea what life is like in Jamaica.  It goes on to compare IMF officials to slave owners and place the blame for all of Jamaica's woes on colonialism and free trade.

For example it spends a lot of time bemoaning how cheap imported food hurts local farmers but never stops to consider how cheap food might benefit people in a developing economy.

1855056,5,B00008NNPK,"Life and Debt examines how the policies of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other aid organizations have changed the Jamaican economy over the past quarter of a century.
Author Jamaica Kincaid narrates to a reggae soundtrack that includes songs by Bob Marley, Ziggy Marley, Mutubaruka and Peter Tosh.

Struggling with huge amounts of national debt in the 1970's, Jamacia is forced to turn to the IMF. The IMF gives them a loan to keep things running, but with terms which include opening the country to free trade. Not able to compete with the prices of subsidised crops and milk from North America, local farming operations collapse. Government officials are lured into establishing ""tax free zones"" in their ports believing they will create local jobs, only to find that companies like Hanes import workers from China and keep them behind a fence where their wages are not spent in the local economy. Their products are created from cotton made in China, by workers from China, all free from tax.

I loved this documentary, but I did read the critical review from ""Island Boy"" seriously (next page). Island Boy writes from Jamaica noting that this documentary leaves out historical information like Manley's policy of 90 percent tax drove which drove the educated middle class and businesses away. His review is something to take note of before watching this film.

What you'll learn from Life and Debt is that we often think we are helping a situation by supporting aid when reality we are only being persuaded to subvert justice. It seems that behind many plans which the government presents as good-hearted is a cleverly disguised plan to benefit the rich. You might take the message of this movie and ask yourself how else you are subverting yourself. Does open-space movement preserve the environment or keep local developers rich by making land artifically scarce? Feminism kept wages lower for US employers in the 1970's when inflation was raging and did little to improve the working life of women and children.

Manley's explanation of the manner in which international commerce and banking affect small economies such as that of Jamaica is insightful.

The sad thing is that the issues explored in this documentary have only gotten worse since the film was made. It is important for citizens of the United States and European Union to understand these issues since the primary media outlets are silent on these weighty matters that have a profound impact on millions of people.

It was Manley's policies of 90 percent income tax and others which led to Jamaica falling at least a generation behind what its potential could have been.

1855060,5,B00008NNPK,"I have viewed this interesting documentary, three times since 2001.

It is looking at the conditions of poverty and desperation inflicted on poor countries, such as Jamaica, by the agenda and policies of international agencies such as the International monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

At first, I found the documentary overdramatic--propaganda filled. In my opinion then, it did not adequately address the issue of the true nature of neo-liberalism ('globalization') in poor countries.

After reexamining the documentary, I concluded that the 'dramatization' may be necessary to convey the message effectively to people far removed from the scene of ""Third World"" poverty.

I am also wondering if the creators of ""Life and Debt"" have looked into the role of the local middle class in the perpetuation of the social and economic issues illustrated in the film.

Who are the local beneficiaries of IMF policies in the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and Asia?

Perhaps, local representatives of imperialism, the upper class and ruling elites, Rightwing and ""Left-lites.""

Historically, members of this class worked to resist meaningful change coming from the people.

They work through their media and institutions to direct discontent and popular demands into the opportunistic arms of the main political parties, ensuring that the status quo of inequality from which their privileges spring, is not disrupted.

In fact, these political parties have ruled since independence, with a firm hand, using the police force brutally, with impunity against the people.

A sequel to ""Life and Debt"" would be welcomed, if it examines debt and poverty in the third world from a more historical and critical perspective.

""Life and Debt"" is still a great documentary. I recommend it highly!

1855061,3,B00008NNPK,"There's a great documentary to made about the impact of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on the Third World. Unfortunately, this isn't it. While many documentaries are one-sided, Black doesn't seem to have understood the possible responses to her apparent position well enough even to bother making a case against them. The strength of her argument suffers as a result. (An example: farmers complain about the high nominal interest rates of their loans, but the rates actually seem extremely reasonable given Jamaica's high inflation rate.) Nevertheless, the film may be worth watching simply to hear the perspectives of native Jamaicans, especially the interview with former Prime Minister Michael Manley (presented more fully in the bonus section of the DVD). Listening to the director's commentary may also provide valuable information that might have been better included in the movie, in place of the poetic-but-unpersuasive narration.",1185753600,3,954,5.541095890410959
1855062,5,B00008NNPK,"LIFE & DEBT, a brilliant documentary by Stephanie Black, takes a cautionary look at the bleak state of the small island nation of Jamaica.  Based on a piece written by Antigua-bred writer, Jamaica Kincaid, this film is beautifully narrated by Belinda Becker.  What's more, it is greatly benefited by an evocative musical score that includes such musicians as Ziggy Marley, along with an original score by Mutabaruka.  The story juxtaposes news reels, candid interview with farmers, former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, Deputy Director of the IMF Stanley Fisher, and President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide (among others), as well as very graphic and honest footage of Jamaican slum life.  You can almost smell the rot coming from the garbage dumps children and families must live close to, on a daily basis, because they simply have no other choice.

LIFE & DEBT takes a very sobering look at the effect of twenty-five years of assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), what resulted from this relationship (including the increasing weakening of Jamaican currency, in favor of the American dollar and an increasing struggle for local farmers, as more and more imported produce found its way onto the shelves and into the bellies of Jamaicans and tourists to Jamaica).  Throughout the story, we hear ""If you come to Jamaica as a tourist, this is what you will see...""  LIFE & DEBT makes an especially strong appeal to anyone who arrives in the island nation, and the way in which people tend to appropriate the beauty of a culture (beaches, corn-rowed hairstyles and local food), while turning a blind eye to the stark reality of those who must survive from day to day.  The narrator paints the picture of a ""typical"" tourist.  This person is a wealthy American who has the means to come and go from Jamaica, sees the rolling beaches, delicious local cuisine and warm weather.  They also see the Jamaican natives, and imagine their life to be quite laid back and worry free.  However, the reality is quite the opposite, since most of the poor subsist on less than the equivalent of one American dollar (once numerous taxes take a considerable bite out of their paycheck).

This film is beautiful, on so many levels.  Stephanie Black made a bold and beautiful choice in the direction she took with her cinematography.  The combination of beautiful and colorful footage of sunsets, and gorgeous flora and fauna, along with black and white montages (to depict the colonialized ""past"" in contrast with present day Jamaica) was really powerful.  What's more, this is the first time I have seen someone respectfully acknowledging the great detrimental effect the WTO (World Trade Organization) and IMF (International Monetary Fund) has had on smaller, greatly disadvantaged nations that have been wrongfully exploited.  I commend Stephanie Black for having the guts to bring LIFE & DEBT to the screen. It is as powerful today as it was when it was originally released in 2001.",1180310400,6,2994,5.030364372469635

1855065,3,B00008NNPK,"In watching this one sided documentary you can't help but be impressed with  the excellent quality of the cinematography, the sound track and the touching way individuals speak about the effect that the governments policies have had on their lives.  By constantly editing back and forth from local poverty and riots to white tourists enjoying the natural splendor of Jamaica with all the comforts of home, the director establishes a powerful separation of wealth and class.  It makes you feel that these tourists are part of the problem and how dare they enjoy their vacation while there are social injustices and poverty that needs to be dealt with in Jamaica. Although a very effective editing tool, it is an unfair use of tourism as tourism is one of the bright lights of the Jamaican economy and is responsible for an ever increasing percentage of the total economy.

The film further goes on to blame the plight of impoverished Jamaicans on the International Monetary Fund, the USA and on big business through the use of interviews with local farmers and factory workers that have been dramatically impacted by the  policies that the Jamaican government imposed to get IMF help and foreign investment. The clear message of the film is that the  IMF and large corporations are at fault for destroying paradise in the name of greed and globalization, however, I can't help but feel that this would be a more convincing film if they had explored the role of the Jamaican government and the policies that led up to the need for outside investment and loans.

1855082,3,B00008NNPK,"This film was interesting as a discussion of Jamaica's problems. I thought the discussion of the not-so-wonderful results of Jamaica's breaking its colonial ties to Britain was fascinating and relevant to the situation in other countries considering the same step. I felt the film was completely off base in discussing the source of most of Jamaica's problems. In reality, Jamaica's biggest problem is that it is vastly overpopulated. Supporting even Jamaica's present population sustainably is just not possible, and the population is still growing. The natural resources of the island are being destroyed for nothing. The population problem was not even mentioned in the film. The film is correct in pointing out that cheap imported goods, such as U.S.-produced food, are hurting the local economy of Jamaica. The reason for this is not, as the filmmakers seem to think, that the U.S. is a nasty country. Rather, the U.S. has chosen the ridiculous course of subsidizing its own destructive agricultural practices at taxpayer expense. Both globalization and the vast productivity of U.S. mechanized farms are essentially fantasies created by cheap oil. Neither has a long-term future. Jamaica would do better to recognize that and work for more realistic oil prices and reduced agricultural subsidies in the U.S., which would benefit both countries. Unfortunately judging by the film, Jamaica is chasing its own fantasy of an ever-rising GDP through expanded tourism. The day will eventually come when Jamaica will have to cope on its own. Will it be ready? This film makes me think it won't.",1140825600,7,1593,5.250980392156863

For a few minutes, we envied the residents of sunny Jamaica, but as Stephanie Black's film moved along, we felt pity for the Jamaicans, struck so hard and cruelly by globalization and the international money interests.

So devoid of hope that they cannot even dream of travel away from their island, at the same time as they see air conditioned buses full of good-time tournists buzzing by their slums.

The scenes of corporations beefing up their security forces were especially chilling. We are seeing the same kind of private police emerging in Iraq.

Could that be what the War in Iraq is about -- protecting corporate interests in prime overseas markets?

See this movie when you can, and then go out for a nice glass of reconstituted milk.  The globalized interests say it is the best thing for you. Don't disappoint them,",1138492800,9,958,4.706586826347305

The movie intersperses some of the technical economic policies with the effects in the every day lives of Jamaicans that have to suffer these decisions.  Watching Stanley Fischer from the IMF talk about what is supposed to happen in theory and listening to farmers and regular Jamaicans explain how it really works is priceless.

Other highlights of the film for me: showing women working under modern day slave conditions sewing designer clothing for large corporations, only to be tossed aside when they raise their heads to power.  This is exactly how workers around the world are pitted against one another in a race to the bottom where corporations seek the lowest wages.

People pretend Jamaica was poor before IMF, Yeah but it was rich before Slavery. I think that was one thing missing the race politics linked to this IMF thing. And if enslavement was enough then there was the whole King and Country thing. It is strange giving someone their independence, it's like saying ""you are free to breathe now, or you are free to eat."" Worst than that Life and Debt shows how what was handed over in ""independence"" was some used up battered economy-sucked dry.

The only failing was that the film speaks to an audience who wants to know. It's not the kind of film you introduce the topic to someone. But again it is fashioned in that way with the music and nice style. But still it is a hard topic to sugar coat and I really think this is one film to have in your collection beyond a shadow of a doubt. The biggest shame actually is films like this; films like 500 Years Later, Sankofa are so few and far between. And the garbage that we watch when there is so much good work which hardly gets notice.

The exhorbitant interest rates (dictated by the IMF) for borrowers which makes their products non competitive with subsidized ones imported from the US is elementary financial bamboozling designed to kill entrepreneurial initiative.

When you're old, if you're not conservative you don't have a brain.""  But I've always thought that was only clever, not true.  As human beings, we all need both strong hearts and perceptive brains, whatever our ages.

What this film so uncomfortably illuminates is the relative equivalence of ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" in the context of Have and Have-Not societies.  It reveals exactly how First World nations and trans-national corporations operate to perpetuate slavery right here, right now, using the IMF and the World Bank.  It's a graphic and disturbing portrayal of the anarchy of economies, an anarchy whose only ethos is might makes right, where the powerful become forever more powerful and the powerless are forever exploited.

This documentary is about Jamaica, the Caribbean island that Americans usually have a stereotypical idea about being just a beautiful tourist island for vacations. However after watching this movie you become more aware about the negative effects of globalization on Jamaica. This documentary was very engaging and interesting, because there was a variety of topics and interviews with many important people such as the former president of Jamaica. The different interviews are from many perspectives, from farmers and laymen to an authority figure in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). From this documentary, you learn how Jamaica has been trapped into a cycle of debt and hardship because of the loans with high interest rates that the World Bank and IMF have provided them. You learn about the insidious trade policies that cause a surplus of imports from overseas to destroy Jamaica's native farmer's chances of succeeding. You learn about how this former British colony is invaded by McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, and big corporations looking for cheap labor that exploits poor Jamaicans. The narration is excellent, the background music features great reggae music, and the cinematography was skillfully employed.

I definitely would suggest watching this documentary to learn more about how America and the IMF's policy's towards Jamaica and other ""developing countries"" have caused them to become mired into economic and social problems.
