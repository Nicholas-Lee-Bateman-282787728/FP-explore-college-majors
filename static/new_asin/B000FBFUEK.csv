2559275,5,B000FBFUEK,"If you're looking for a quick and easy workout, Slim & Lean is not it.  Jari's first offering, Ripped, is for beginner to intermediate exercisers looking for an endurance workout.  Slim & Lean is for inter-advanced exercisers looking for a challenging endurance workout.  Yes, you work a muscle to fatigue and Jari makes sure there are enough reps to do that.  96 lunges is a LOT!  If you are looking for the challenge of an endurance workout, you'll certainly get it here.

This is my favorite kind of workout because you develop long and lean muscles.  Jari is the consummate professional.  In addition to the pointers at the beginning of each section, she gives form pointers throughout.  She even says to ""bear with me"" at times because the reps go on for 4+ minutes. That's what an endurance workout is all about - high reps!  But Jari varies the count to make it more interesting and challenging.

Personally, I love all three of her offerings and use them weekly with wonderful results.",1151107200,16,993,4.715116279069767
2559276,5,B000FBFUEK,"This is an awesome workout!  There are exercises which work every major muscle in the body.  For each exercise Jari does alot of reps - this is great for me because I can build muscle without using heavy weight.  Heavy weight hurts my back.  There are other exercisers in the background showing options for each exercise.  Also, they show how much weight each person is using so you have an idea of where to start.  They show technique for each exercise so you know if you are doing it safely or not.

I feel phenomenal after doing this workout!  I did the first Get Ripped video for a few months and it took away most of my chronic back pain.  This workout works!  This second video makes the workout even more challenging.  Its a great overall workout that doesn't involve any bouncing around.  Once again, Jari has a calm, sensible, and encouraging demeanor.  She is very motivating without being shrill and irritating like some video divas.",1150502400,9,944,4.614457831325301
2559277,2,B000FBFUEK,I'm sure this would work if you could do it long enough without being bored out of your mind! All of the moves are very basic and you do a lot of them. The set is boring and the instructor is boring. I purchased this because everyone on the exchange wanted it. I did it once and put it up for trade right after I finished. Mina Lessig's One Minute Workout is far superior because you can up the weight and the DVD always randomly chooses your workout for you so you don't get bored.,1148515200,11,482,4.08421052631579
2559278,5,B000FBFUEK,"I really like Jari Love's Slim and Lean. I had tried her original workout, ""Get Ripped"" and found it a bit easy for me as I am an advanced exerciser. That is definitely NOT a problem with this workout. Using relatively low weights (I used 5-12 pounds) and a high number of repetitions, Jari leads you through a series of exercises that target each muscle group.  She adds on killer pulses to the moves on some muscle groups. My quads and shoulders felt the burn with all of those pulses!  I liked the music in this workout better than the music of ""Get Ripped"". Some of the tracks were familiar to me from other workout videos (Cathe Friedrich) and they were definitely less headache-inducing. I also found the ab workout to be slightly more difficult than ""Get Ripped"", which is a good thing.

The background exercisers show a wide range of modifications, so this workout is great for people of all fitness levels. I recommend this one for people looking to tone up and increase their muscular endurance. You definitely get a big bang for your buck with this workout.",1148256000,90,1068,4.610526315789474
2559279,5,B000FBFUEK,"I don't know why Amazon isn't releasing this till July when you can already buy it online elsewhere, but I've got it already and this is what I think of it ...

After a quick warmup, there is a workout that is just under one hour of toning.  You do the exercises standing and seated.  Jari uses A LOT of repetitions - 45 push ups etc and the weights can be anywhere from 3lbs to 20lbs.  That sounds like hard work and it is, but it's worth it because the results that I've seen with this dvd is more dramatic than any other workout I've done.

Each section begins with a quick one-on-one demo of the proper form that you need to avoid injury.  At the end of the dvd is a segment all about healthy eating.  If you do this often enough, it almost won't matter what you eat, because you will be burning so many calories even at rest, you'll practically be able to eat whatever you want.  Admittedly 90 plus lunges are tough going, but try and work your way through this dvd and your friends will be envious of your new body.",1146268800,47,1021,4.173469387755102

2559295,3,B000FBFUEK,"In all Jari Love's Get Ripped videos, there are modifications and Jari does a great job leading you through the exercises. That being said, of the 4 I have, this is my least favorite. It's fine, and I use it sometimes to mix it up, but I'm not such a fan. I particularly don't like the pulses. I prefer more explosive movements, and I find the pulse pacing sort of difficult to follow. I much prefer Get Ripped to the Core.",1471132800,,423,4.234567901234568
2559296,5,B000FBFUEK,"Holy Cow.  If you use a challenging weight you will be to near failure at the end of the reps.  It's a tough tape, and I'm a bit of workout tape collector and workout on most days.  It IS a little boring. Her voice is way calm.... I really enjoy TurboFire or T25, quick, short, energetic and get a good sweat.  But this tape is very effective and if I'm going to do weight training I will pick Jari Love.",1470614400,,404,4.0125
2559297,4,B000FBFUEK,"I have worked out to this dvd several times now and it is fast becoming one of my favorites. The workout is harder than the original ""Ripped"" dvd, but not so hard that a beginning exerciser like me has to quit in despair. I'm not yet strong enough to do the single-leg squats, or all of the push-up reps, but I enjoy making the attempt. This workout is the most like ""Body Pump"" classes of any dvd I have tried so far. Jari keeps the chatter to a minimum and her cuing is good. At the beginning of each track, a fitness model demonstrates the exercises and some of the modifications. At the end of each track is a brief stretch. Overall, the pace is good; I have just enough time to change weights and get into position for the next track before it begins. If I'm going to exercises to a dvd, I really like to be able to just get it done!",1466380800,3,838,4.115853658536586

2559299,5,B000FBFUEK,"Jari Love's fitness routines are fantastic! I use her DVDs in combination with a number of different exercises (to stay motivated consistently), but I always look forward to this DVD in particular. It helped me get back into shape for summer! Lost fat, gained lean muscle. Jari Love is the real deal! I've recommended ""Get Ripped! Slim & Lean"" to a number of my friends and have had nothing but positive feedback. Doing this DVD three times per week equals results (don't forget to increase your dumbbell/barbell weight every month or so to get the maximum benefit)!",1457827200,2,566,4.845360824742268

2559302,4,B000FBFUEK,"Pros
Lots of reps
Her cues are pretty good
I like the breaks in between so i can stretch. Many ppl have a problem with that
She works out with u although sometimes its nice to take a break and check out the form but she always talks about it and the camera does cue to the others on set
Older middle aged ppl motivate me to get on their level

Cons
Dont like the music
Could do without some of the camel toe shots
All her dvds have the same monotonous workouts in varying order and challenge level
Her warm ups are boring previews of the work out to come and are typically all the same
Her background ppl lack personality

Overall i love her workouts due to high reps and she isn't boring in personality she is mellow which is ok for me. I have gotten stronger and continue to be challenged. Ive used her videos off and on for three years but have consistently been at it two three times in rotation a week for three months",1453420800,2,923,4.122222222222222

pause button for arm workout or previous button to get extra legs...
If you like Jari's workouts, you need to add this one to your collection.

Can modify if needed.  Bought to supplement daily cardio and weights at gym twice a week.  Would suggest dumbbells between 3 and 15 pounds depending on fitness.

I do not need to lose weight or have a weight problem, I do it for toning, and now, 3 months later, I have gained 7 pounds of muscle. My clothes fit better and I feel great. I am really happy so far and I alternate between videos. I do a video for about 4-6 weeks, then either switch the dvd, or up my weights. I could never do pull ups, pushups, etc. before these videos, now I can and my strength is only increasing.

I've been using it at least twice a week for 2 months, and i am probably the most toned i've ever been.  I am tall and thin and avid exerciser.. I love barre workouts and pilates.  But this workout finally gave me the definition i wanted.  I'm a 33 yo mother of 2 little boys, but look better than i did in college running 5 plus miles 6 days a week.  Promise it works!

i have three other workouts by her... I like the bootcamp and the Ripped 1000.. with the red case.  I like to use those when i want to get in some cardio with some weight training.  I will not hesitate to buy more..

only thing i wish.. and this is true of most DVDS i own..
I like being able to turn off the music and just hear cues (so i can play my own, much better music) none of Jari's DVDs that I have tried so far have this option.
I also like being able to program the different tracks for shorter workouts.. I like to do a full 1 hour workout on weekend days, but during the hectic week, sometimes i only have 30 minutes to spare, and having it already set up to play for me in the order i want, would be helpful.",1369785600,4,1197,3.9707112970711296
2559368,4,B000FBFUEK,"This DVD is great for building up muscle tone.  I have noticed a dramatic improvement in the shape of my legs, arms, and backside.  Jari uses different weights depending upon which muscle group(s) are being worked and I highly encourage anyone who uses this video to invest in a variety of dumbells because you will need different weight depending upon which muscles you're working.  I am finding I'm progressing very quickly and lifting heavier weights than Jari is in a couple of the segments.  There is the single-legged squat portion and with that I am using a 10 pound dumbell and then doing that whole portion, along with the wide-legged squat twice (and I hold 2 10 lbs dumbells with that one now).  It seems to me that once I got the hang of exercises, that doing that part one time has not been enough.  (I plan to get heavier weights and possible that will help.)

Jari also encourages dietary changes.  I've not changed my diet but have seen the muscles build up, but I don't have the ultra sculpted look because I still eat the same (not junk/fast food, but carbs/bread).  The only way to chistle would be to also take out some of my beloved carbs ;)  My legs have gone from mushy to hard, though...and this video has helped A LOT!

2559393,4,B000FBFUEK,"This morning was the first time we had ever done this workout or anything from Jari Love for that matter.  We were looking for an all weights workout and this workout definetly delivered. Overall, I really liked this workout and I am looking forward to adding it into our rotation. I am already feeling sore in my chest, legs and biceps and I did ths whole workout with 8lb weights. She does a variation of pulses and static holds which is a great variation and using light weight you definetly feel the intensity when you are near the end. It's good. And it is a full body workout hitting all of the muscle groups. I was sweating pretty good through the whole thing.
Cons:  The number one thing that I did not like about this workout is that there is really no warmup. You are immediatly doing squats and other moves with light weights right from the beginning. We workout first thing in the a.m. and my body needs to get warmed up before I can really get into the moves. I think in the future I will be adding a short cardio workout before doing this workout.  The other thing that really bothered me is that in almost all of the moves it seems like the people in video are all doing a different excercise. I am not sure if that is so you can see that there are different ways to do the move or what but you are not sure who to watch when you want to check your form. Also, when she does the dead lift, it doesn't look like any deadlift I have ever seen. It looks to me like they are all doing a squats.  Very strange. The cuing is off and she isn't great about giving direction either. There is a short instruction before each set which is great for a begginer and if someone has never done weight training before.  Anyway, if you are looking for weight training, I would buy it. The pro's outweigh the cons.",1339718400,,1811,4.23768115942029

Basically all this DVD does is count your reps on multiple exercises that aren't new or innovative in any way.  If you want to do almost a hundred reps of squats and lunges then great, but you can do them in your own living room for free.  Don't waste your money on this DVD.

I've been searching for good workout dvd's and I think Jari is the key!  She knows what she's talking about, isn't annoying like some trainers, and the music is good too.  It reminds me of BTS Group Power.  There are 4 people on the set showing different modifications and it shows you what weight they all use on each exercise.  It's long, just over 60 minutes so make sure you have the time for it, but well worth it.  Doing this 2-3 times a week would be all you'd need for strength training.",1287964800,3,618,4.321739130434783

I did when I was in that zone and right away, as in relatively quick.  It has been sometime since I have done this DVD, I intend on getting back on the bandwagon using this DVD for sculpting and toning.  Something that Jari Love keeps talk about in the DVD is the number of repetitions , there are small movements but a lot of them.  She does a good job focusing on technique.  The other performers in the DVD follow varied levels for beginners, intermediate and advanced. So if you are tired on some day just do beginners.  For cardio, pick something else.  I haven't ever done this continuously for months, but mostly twice a week for about 3 months and it helped because I was sore for the next couple of days.  Again, it is broken up in segments working on different areas of the body, so you can skip certain sections.  I've almost always followed the way it is.  For a certain level, you may need a step for one of the levels but don't have to haev it. You will need a minimum of 3-5 pound dumbells of course for all levels.",1279324800,4,1190,4.148471615720524

Okay, I read some of the not so nice comments here and that's how I knew I would like this DVD. I think it is more for beginners or intermediate. That said, I want to encourage anybody who is terribly out of shape or have problem body parts (I have a knee problem and lower back issues) to get this video. Do what you can and your endurance will come. I stopped several times my first time but I finished it. I really am in horrible shape but if I can get through the entire thing-yes, I stopped a few times-I think beginners who are as bad as I am or are in better condition than I am in will be fine. Just push through little by little until it's time to upgrade to a more intense workout.

There are are different trainers on the DVD you could follow. If being fit and healthy is important to you then get this DVD to start with. It may not look like much if you see a preview but believe me you will get a workout. It just creeps up on ya.

Next I will try Extremely Ripped 1000 by Jari Love and then Zumba which looks amazing!

Best of all, I see my muscles becoming more defined.  Yay! I love a workout that makes me feel sore afterwards.  It makes me feel like I've actually accomplished something for the time and sweat I put into it.  This workout defintely does that.  If you are a beginner to Jari's Ripped workouts I would start w/ this one or the original Ripped first.  From all of the reveiws I have read on Amazon and on Jari's website, each consecutive DVD gets more challenging so I am planning on purchasing them in order of release and then rotating them to keep my workouts varied and changing.  Slim & Lean is a great workout and combined w/ a healthy diet and other exercises like cardio and pilates or yoga should get any exerciser in much better shape.",1269216000,4,1036,4.293814432989691

By the reviews I thought I was going to get a good workout.  I didn't even break a sweat!  There is a lot of wasted time in between segments where I'd rather be working out then just stretching or watching the correct method for an exercise.  I feel she wastes time by having you sit to do arm excercises when you could be doing squats and arm exercises at the same time.

This workout is set up with a 5 minute warm-up and then 5 minute segments that each work one muscle group.  There is no cardio and the muscle groups are worked individually.  This allows you to focus on the muscle being worked but it doesn't get the heart rate up like working multiple muscle groups together does.  The only equipment used is hand weights.  There is an option for using barbells in many of the segments.  In addition to Jari, there are 3 other expercisers present, each demonstrating a different modification of the exercise (beginner through advanced).

This video does a lot of squats and lunges which, while great for the lower body, may pose a problem to anyone with knee issues.  The exercises are mostly basic solid strength training.  There are dead lifts, push ups, squats, lunges, tricep dips, ect.  This is not a video for someone who wants to learn new innovative moves.

About 10 minutes into the viewing, I had to shut it off and have never tried the exercises because she doesn't appear fit, she appears almost anorexic which, as the title of my review says, I find disturbing.

2559427,3,B000FBFUEK,"First of all, I want to preface this by saying, I think these are good basic exercises that will get you results.  You are doing low weight (well, whatever you choose, really) and high reps.  The fact that you are doing so many reps may force you to go lower on the weight.  I personally only do 5lbs at this point... that's because my normal exercise routines usually consist of mainly cardio, so my muscles aren't so developed.

Now, that being said...  the video is straight up boring.  I don't get excited to do this workout at all.  I dread it, so I end up only doing it about once a week instead of the reccomended 2-3 times.  The set is dark and boring looking.  The background exercisers demonstrating advanced and modified poses never talk.  Jari has no sense of humor.. not much personality, and frankly her looks are kind of scary.  Her face looks as though she has had some plastic surgery.  What a great message to send to people trying to get in shape the right way.  The few times she does talk it's pretty cheesy.  Personally, her style does not really motivate me, but maybe it works for some people.

The abs section and stretching section are too short.  Abs are your body's powerhouse.  They deserve more than 4 minutes of isolation.  Stretching after almost an hour of hard work should constitute more than 4 minutes too.

Overall, I think I'm going to stick with it as much as I can because I do believe it's going to help develop my muscles, but I'm not going to enjoy it as I do my other workouts.  Jari makes me even more grateful for instructors like Billy Blanks!

Update:  After sticking with this video (though it was hard to fight the boredom) I have seen RESULTS.  The results have made up for the boringness.  This is the first time in my life, I look muscular, but as Jari says - not big and bulky.  She is still not my favorite instructor.  I can't pinpoint the dislike, but she knows what she's doing. Try to get past the boredom and Jari's style if it bothers you because she will get you in shape.",1238457600,13,2034,4.386058981233244

You can do the whole workout or go to the chapters and just do specific ones.  I use the chapters to change up the order and keep it fresh.  She's really motivating while your working out.  Its great for a home workout because you don't need a lot of equipment.  Just some hand weights and a step.  The step you can even trade out for a stair or chair.

Jari is so sweet, kind, and encouraging, which I appreciate on the 71st repetition. I feel like I am working out with a small group of friends and always look forward to the 3/week workouts even though I have been using this (and the other Get Ripped dvds) for 2 years.

This dvd is one I go to repeatedly compared to the newer ones. After the Get Extremely Ripped dvd with the red/orange cover, Jari transitioned into a different person almost. She went from relating to the viewer to relating more to the people on the set. She also got so much thinner, which was not ever an issue for her in the first place. I worry that she's gone from being beautifully fit to underweight and unhealthy.

I have been working out consistently for the past 3 months.
A little cardio here and little strength there has yielded me some decent results. But I was getting bored with the workouts and it was time to switch it up and go harder!!!
I did my research and was lead to Jari Love.
I read so many positive reviews that I had to try it & let me tell you there is no buyer's remorse over here.
Slim and Lean is a no nonsense workout.
I could care less for music and flare. She gets down to business and if you like that when it comes to your workout, then this is the one for you!
Her instruction is awesome with just the right touch of motivation!
It really puts you to the challenge. I was almost in tears.
I may have cried and got it confused with all the sweat:)
It lets me know that results are inevitable with this work out as long as I stay consistent, and keep my eating habits clean as possible.
It's only been a few weeks and I feel it everywhere.
The only beef I have with this work out is that it doesn't stay on  abs too tough, but I do like the exercises she has for them...it still burns!!!
Slim & Lean is totally enhancing my exercise regimen.
I can tell my endurance is increasing because I can go through cardio without huffing as usual!
I recommend this to anyone who is really looking to go the extra mile in their workouts.

Okay, not just this tape, I also use her other ones, but you get the gist! Jari's workout style is lighter weights (3-10lb's)and high rep's. I use 3,5 or 8lb dumbbells personally, and for me 8lb's kill! Not only do you get a resistance workout you also get cardio benefits as her moves incorperate multiple body parts raising the heart rate into your target zone. Typically I burn around 430 calories or so doing this. Each of her tapes has it's own style. This one is more focused on pulsing moves, where you really are tearing down that muscle and it burns! This and her ""Ripped to the Core"" I think are the ideal companions for strength training. Toss in her ""Ripped 1,000"" once a week, and woo-hoo your well on your way to getting slim & lean!",1217635200,5,894,4.424242424242424

I'd like to alternate Jari's DVDs on my Strength day but I'd always end up just alternating them on Sundays when I have 60-90 min. to exercise. I'm pretty sure that if I would have been consistent with those 2 DVDs 2-3 times/week for the last 9 months or so, I would have been ripped by now [that's assuming I ate 'CLEAN']. I watch what I eat but I'm not strict. I lost 18 lbs. and went down from size 14 to size 8...so I'm making progress. I'd like to slim down some more and have muscle definition. This DVD has the basic moves like bicep curls, push ups, squats, lunges, triceps extensions, etc. done in HIGH reps. It's easy to follow; no complicated moves at all. It's just too long for me. I'm aware that I can just pick sections that would just add up to 1/2 hr-40 min. each time including warm up, cooldown and stretch but it just doesn't feel right chopping up Jari Love's whole routine. I feel like it wouldn't be as effective....But if I had that extra hour before going to work, I sure pick Jari's DVDs 'coz I feel REALLY worked out when I'm done with them.

I own all of her workouts, but this one I didn't like right away (hence the 4 stars), but once I found the right modifications for me it became a favorite. During the leg sections, I add upper body movements whereever it fits in, like shoulder press, lateral raise, biceps curls, etc.. During the upper body sections, I put on ankle weights and add leg side lifts, knee lifts, etc. This turns this into an extremely efficient workout for me burning lots of calories and getting my heart rate way up even though it's not cardio. I had been stuck on a plateau for a while using heavy weights only and this one got me past it.

The nice thing about this one is that your really focus on one area at a time, as opposed to doing the compound moves in some of her other DVD's. I actually alternate out this one with Ripped 1000 and it really works. I would recommend combining this workout with some cardio- it's a good workout, and you'll definitely break a sweat, but it doesn't so much get your heart rate up and doesn't work as well if it's the only workout you are using. Jari Love is my favorite, I would recommend Ripped DVD's to anyone- just bought another one, in fact!",1209340800,,633,4.283333333333333
2559450,4,B000FBFUEK,"This was my first venture into the Jari Love workouts.  I'm hooked. I bought the set of three (Slim & Lean, Ripped, and Ripped to the Core) and tried the Slim and Lean first.  All the moves are really simple.  No fancy, hard to follow footwork or expensive equipment is required.  (I don't consider the handweights expensive.)  And to me, that's important because if I can't keep up with the move or they're confusing the video will do nothing but collect dust.

The only thing I didn't like about the video was the breaks of instuction between each track.  There is a man's voice and another man demonstrating the move.  This is helpful for the first and second time using it, but once you got the moves down (again, they're really not complex) you don't need the instuction.

Jari is very positive and encourages you to keep going.  I like that there are always someone else doing a modification.

Great video!",1206748800,7,912,4.60248447204969
2559451,5,B000FBFUEK,"I used to be in good shape about seven years ago and suddenly life got in the way and I ballooned up to 200+ pounds.  Being over 30 now, I couldn't seem to get my metabolism burning fat off my body. While surfing Amazon one day, I stumbled across Jari Love's dvd's by complete accident.  From my knowledge and reading of fitness mags like ""Oxygen"", these sounded good.  To get to the point, I have been eating clean, alternating Jari's Slim & Lean with my Tae Bo and Turbo Jam workouts for about three weeks now.  The verdict so far?  I have lost inches and a good ten pounds!  I like Jari's professional yet caring demeanor and disagree with some reviews which say she is BORING.  In addition, if you haven't actually given the workout a serious try, along with appropriate caloric consumption and a few weeks, you won't be able to appreciate the REAL and FAST results from Get Ripped workouts.  Can't wait to try the rest of my Ripped collection.  Thanks Jari!",1205884800,6,962,4.482758620689655
2559452,5,B000FBFUEK,"Love this dvd.  I have over a hundred dvds, but lately these are the only ones I do.  I never thought I would like an hour long sculpting routine.  I always thought, cardio, cardio, cardio and then a bit of weights to get results.  Not true.  This is the first time I can really see results and I know they are from this dvd.  I can never get any real muscle tone in my arms for some reason, even if I do tons of pushups.  I finally see toned arms.  And I can definitely see results in my butt and thighs.  I am not a beginner exerciser.  I have always done plis, squats and lunges.  Although my legs have always been strong, they have never been this toned before.  I do this dvd and her first one two times a week.  I find the first one a bit too easy, however.  I will soon be buying her other workouts to include in my rotation.",1201824000,7,832,3.9939024390243905
2559463,5,B000FBFUEK,"Jari Love is fantastic and so is all of her dvds. This one is a kicker lots of reps some fast some slow, you will feel it. As usual the rippers are in the background showing modifications. Here is a tip Im pretty ripped in the arms, back, and chest and the chest section can be a killer, pyramid your weights up. This means when the chest track start use 2-3 pounds for the first 20 reps, 5 pounds for the next 20 and 7-8 pounds for the last few. Or if you want you could pyramid down with the weights which means starting with the heavier ones first.  Yes you will be shaking but it is so worth it. I would suggest you pyramid down with the triceps section too that one is a a killer. Jari also has you doing weighted squats and one leg squats. She once again hits every major muscle group. Very effective and the exercises are clearly demonstrated.",1199923200,6,850,4.182926829268292
2559464,5,B000FBFUEK,"Jari's workout will make your muscles burn. The first time I did the workout I was sore for 3 days. My favorite thing about this workout is that you can make it as hard or easy on yourself as you want. She recommends you move slowly up on weights and encourages continual and gradual progression. Jari's cohorts demonstrate beginner to advanced exercise levels so it is very easy to follow the model of your choice, or just follow Jari through the whole thing. Jari is not a chatterbox (Denise Austin) and she makes appropriate, not overbearing or annoying motivational statements throughout and at the end of each segment. The setting is muted and the music reflects the intensity of the exercise, the focus is most definately on proper form and technique combined with high reps which will get you slim and lean in no time.",1199923200,3,825,4.696551724137931
2559465,3,B000FBFUEK,i like ripped to the core better. When looking at JL working out-her ribs stick out along her sides-that is not muscle its her ribs and photos supposedly make you look heavier than you are. Anyone can look ripped if they weigh 10 pounds. So don't go by her physique-the workout is okay.,1199664000,4,286,4.415094339622642

I find Jari's style refreshing: no-nonsense, no annoying cardio/dance moves, etc.  Just awesome, intense weight sets that will really push you to your limits.  I have had awesome results so far, much better results than when I was an avid Firm user.  The S&L is great and hard and killer.

After the warm up, it turns into an instrustional video where some random man will do a basic move (like a push up) and a voice will explain the move.  They don't even do reps that you may perfrom to, they simply explain the move and begin a new move.

This may be the style that some people want (I could see men enjoying this style), but I prefer to workout along with the instructer.  I did not like this video.",1191974400,10,563,4.036036036036036
2559468,5,B000FBFUEK,"After doing Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight video three times a week for three months it became a little mundane, so I ordered this video to try and switch it up a bit, and hopefully kick my work-out up a notch.  Boy did it!  I had worked my way up to 10 and 15 lb weights with Kathy's video, but am now back down to 5 and 8 lb weights with this one, and can still barely finish each segment.  Jari does many more reps, and she does alot of pulsing and slow lifting which really works the muscles much more.  Same with the lower body work-out.  I had no problem doing squats and lunges after three months with Kathy, but find my legs burning horribly with Jari. I've been doing this video 3xweek for 3 weeks, and still feel like I need a nap afterwards. This is my first video of Jari, and I like her.  She's easy to follow, doesn't move through excersises to quickly, and is no-nonsense.  I will definately order more of her videos.  I personally cannot see starting off with this video if you've never lifted weights, or done squats and lunges before.  To me, this is not a beginner video at all, but a great step up from a beginner level.",1191974400,5,1151,4.219178082191781
2559469,5,B000FBFUEK,"It's amazing. I keep seeing better results with each passing month. (I've been doing ripped videos for a little over 3 months now.)  I actually started seeing some changes in my body after doing this video just 3 times.  Slim & Lean is a great workout & you will see results. It's given me the best results of anything i've tried yet.  I rotate this video with a few other of jari's workouts. I like slim & lean & ""ripped to the core"" best. They get me huffing & puffing every time.

  This workout is very no nonsense & straightforward weight training. using low weights with high reps to tone up. and it works! Even though it is a high # of reps, to me it does not seem boring at all because you are constantly changing up how you do each move (she'll vary the speed/counts for each move). Honestly i am so challenged by the workout that there is no room for boredom.  I like her videos so much that i want to do them every day.  I was previously the aerobics queen & thought i was in good shape. that is until i tried jari's videos. Now I feel myself getting stronger & stronger as the weeks go by. My arms look fabulous & i'm finally trimming down the tire on my waist that never goes away. I am SO toned up now. no leg jiggle or back of the arm flab. The pot belly i always have since my late twenties is finally shrinking. My back looks really great now & my posture is even better.  I am still small & womanly, only now i am tight & toned. I love it.

  Every fitness level can benefit from this video. While this is a tough workout that even the most advanced person will ""feel the burn"", beginners should not be intimidated.  I would encourage anyone to incorporate this or any of jari's workouts into their routine.  You can adjust the workouts to suit your fitness level by increasing or decreasing weights or by not using any at all to begin with. Jari also gives suggestions for modifications in case a particular move is too challenging or advanced. One of the video demonstrators shows an easy modification, while another modifies the move to make it more intense for those that are at a higher fitness level.  You simply use whatever technique & weight load works for you.

  Only problem is that now i feel like no other workouts are as intense so i have to force myself to do cardio in between ripped workouts. That's right, the former cardio queen is now hooked on getting ripped.

Note: I want to give a tip for those new to weight lifting:  I've noticed that Jari's recommendation of 3 times a week is too frequent for me.  My muscles seem to need more time to rest.  I was getting too fatigued & sore doing her routines 3 times a week so i only do them  about twice a week now & i feel great & have wonderful results.  If you find you are very sore when it is supposedly time to do the video again just hold off one more day & let those muscles rest up.  Or if after some time you fell like you are not progressing well than maybe you will benefit from more rest time in between.  let those muscles have time to repair themselves. You'll see great results if you do.......have fun getting ripped :)",1187222400,37,3120,4.245762711864407
2559470,5,B000FBFUEK,"This is a great workout.  By great, I don't mean great fun, but great work.  I had been looking for a good strength training workout.  I took a chance on this one and have been very pleased!  The total workout lasts about an hour, but if you don't have the time to do it all, you can use the menu and choose the specific tracks that you want.  There are 12 workout segments of about five minutes each.  The first is a warm-up and the last a stretch.  You will need dumbbells, a lighter set and a heavier one.  If you're a beginner, you might want to start out with no weights.  They use a step for one of the tricep exercises and one member of the team uses a ball.  Neither are necessary; I don't use them.  One thing I like about this workout is that I can work hard if I want, or not; I just choose weights according to how I feel that day.  This workout is appropriate for beginners or advanced strength trainers, just adjust your weights accordingly.  Again, I'm very pleased with this strength training workout.  I know that I'm not wasting my time with this; I have begun to see results, which, of course, is what I'm after.",1186444800,5,1131,4.224299065420561
2559471,5,B000FBFUEK,I thought this workout to be great for toning and endurance. I definitely believe that with a balanced diet and some cardio you can lean out your body. The first few times are a bit challenging but after your body gets use to it increasing weight is encouraged. Most of the exercises use weights combined with either squats or lunges. If you are not feeling the burn or sweating you probably need to add some weight as to advance. Their is an abs portion towards the end which also helps bring down the heart rate. I found the most challenging exercise to be the overhead presses but minimizing the weight helped me get through these. I definitley recommend this workout to any one who seeks a challenge and is determined to tone their body.,1185753600,,741,4.537313432835821

2559487,5,B000FBFUEK,"I recently discovered Jari Love and am greatly enjoying her workouts.  Although her original Get Ripped is my favorite so far, Slim & Lean, the second in the series, is also an excellent workout.  As with all of the Ripped workouts, Jari and her three background exercisers vary not only in the equipment they use (eg, dumbbells, barbells, and weight plates, plus optional equipment like a stability ball) but also in their individual weight loads, which are helpfully shown on screen at the start of every new exercise.  Slim & Lean also has a couple of new features: 1) in addition to the weight loads, rep totals are also show on screen, and 2) Jari adds pulsing repetitions.

For every exercise, Jari performs a high number of repetitions, but her varied counts (eg, 4-4, 3-1, 1-3, 2-2, pulsing, etc.) keep things interesting.  As with the other Ripped workouts, the Slim & Lean DVD is chaptered so that each exercise is its own individual track.  The 12 total tracks, each about 5-6 minutes in length, are as follows: warm-up (5-minute overview of various exercises using light weights), squats, front-back lunges, chest presses, bent leg deadlifts/deadrows, push-ups/rotator cuff, tricep dips/overhead extension, biceps/hammer curls, single leg squats/wide squats, overhead press/lateral raise, abs (5-minute series of 4 exercises repeated once), cool-down.

The Main Menu of the Slim & Lean DVD offers the following options:  Introduction-Full Workout-Exercises (chapters)-Interview with Angela (a registered dietitian)-Credits-Preview ""To the Core""-More Ripped Workouts.  I found Slim & Lean to be more challenging than the original Get Ripped for several reasons, including the pulsing repetitions, the increased repetitions of more challenging exercises (such as many more squats and push-ups), and the longer overall length (Slim & Lean comes in just over an hour).  Also, I didn't think Jari's cueing was quite as good as in the original, as she sometimes cues a bit late (similarly, the screen showing the weight loads is sometimes a bit late as well).  Still, this is definitely an excellent full-body endurance workout for intermediate-to-advanced exercisers, and it is likely to appeal particularly to those who are looking for a greater challenge than the original Get Ripped.  My overall rating: 4 1/2 stars.",1183248000,11,2326,5.325136612021858

2559490,5,B000FBFUEK,"I did a little preview of this dvd the day I purchased it and was disappointed by the dark set, what looked like unnecessarily long breaks at the beginning of each set (where the move is demonstrated with proper form) and generally what seemed like low production values, however, I gave it a try the following day and I was NOT disappointed.

I enjoy The Firm a lot and really hadn't yet found anything that challenged me as much as my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-5-Days-Abs-Upper-Body-Tough-Tape-2-Standing-Legs-Boxset/dp/B000GOI42G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm - 5 Days Abs / Upper Body / Tough Tape 2 / Standing Legs (Boxset)</a>&nbsp;yet (but I'm getting tired of the cheesy 80s sets and hair). I have to say that this workout surpasses it.

I'm not a person who like ""dancey"" workouts -- I'm so uncoordinated that I feel like I miss some of the workout trying to figure out what foot to start with. This workout is more like a straight bodybuilding, weightlifting workout, nothing at all choreographed, just very basic exercises very well demonstrated.

One thing that this dvd does really smartly which I wish all workout dvds using weights would take notice of is that when the demonstrators pick up weights, they show on the screen the weights each participant is using. This gives me a really good idea of what I should be picking up. Many dvds tell you to pick up ""light"" or ""heavy"" dumbbells at various points, but this is so vague and I often have to change in the middle.

The people demonstrating the moves also are showing various modifications. For instance, one of them sits on a balance ball for some. Some of them use a barbells when others are using dumbbells, etc. This is great and shows us some modifications without spending a lot of time on it.

I was initially annoyed with the breaks at the beginning of each set which show proper form and some modifications, however, I learned to live with them. In fact, each set is so vigorous that I really could use the short break every time.

More than anything, though, this is a VERY TOUGH workout (which beginners can still use, but with lighter weights, of course) that took my muscles to absolute exhaustion on every set. It was wonderful and I felt an amazing sense of accomplishment when I was done.

I've tried other videos but rarely find ones I like, they either don't seem very hard, are boring, I hate the bubbly/fake instructors, or they have terrible form. Not so with this one. I loved it and best of all it is the only thing that has worked for me. While I have not lost any weight, my husband kept commenting that I looked like I had lost a lot of weight. Then one day I didn't have any clean pants and on a whim tried on a pair that hadn't fit me in at least 2 1/2 years fully expecting them to not fit ( before they wouldn't even come halfway up my butt ) and they fit! I was so excited! Then I tried on my smallest pair of jeans ( which before wouldn't even come halfway up my thighs) and they now come about halfway up my butt. I still have some more to go but I love this. Especially since I have only done it maybe 4-6 times in the last month and a half and have made no changes to diet ( that's my next thing to do) and have not done much cardio or other exercise.

Oh, also I have a very weak upper body and I have noticed definate strength gains there and my muscles feel quite a bit harder although I still can't get through all the push-ups.

I love aerobics workouts but not so interested wieght building so I needed some motivation also. Lucky for me several people shared these good reviews of this DVD and I decided to try it.

The sets for each muscle group provide a mix of exercises so I don't get bored. I love how the reps are mixed up by slowing contraction and extension between 1 count and 4 counts. The exercises selected seem to target all the right areas to give an overall body workout.

This workout is so well put together and thoughfully composed that although I always feel a tightness the next two days in my muscles but I never end up so sore I can't move. This is one of the few workouts that delivers on its promises.

I should mention if you are not already in decent shape you should start with the first Get Ripped which helps build a base. I have some friends who have knee problems so I will say there are a lot of squats, lunges, and deadlifts in this DVD that are not in the first DVD.",1169683200,7,1088,4.196172248803828

Jari does suggest that if the weights you are using are not challenging, to overload in order to get results.  I work out every day and thought that I was in great shape.  I have quite a few Firm workouts, which are fantastic, but they do not push you like this DVD.  Jari is pleasant to listen to; she is not perky or condescending or mechanical.  However, this is not a workout for the beginner.  The workout is extremely challenging; but, if you use light weights and continue to progress, there is no question that there will be results.

2559515,5,B000FBFUEK,"After a few of months of working out to the original ""Get Ripped"" DVD, I felt it was time to move on to a more challenging workout to gain further results. In just one month of using ""Get Ripped: Slim & Lean"" I have toned up considerably more and my muscles are becoming more defined. I actually enjoy doing this workout more than the former, as not only does it contain more extensive and challenging abdominal work than its precedessor, but most of the accompanying electronica music is actually very good. I especially love the song towards the end of the workout that's playing during the overhead presses and lateral raises.

Jari Love's instruction and queing is so clear and precise. She never wastes time performing silly moves that ""look"" impressive yet offer little results. In fact, her entire routine serves as proof that a workout can be very challenging and super effective without being difficult to learn or follow along. The basic concept of ""Slim & Lean"" is the use of light weights (anywhere from 3 to 10 pound dumbells - or you can use a barbell for most of the exercises) while performing very high repetitions of mostly well known exercises (such as squats, lunges, over-head presses, chest presses, bicep curles, hammer curls, etc.) and by varying the speed of the exercises. There are also a lot of pulses and isometic holds performed throughout to create ultra lean, defined muscles. Jari Love's own physique is a testiment to that.

Jari is joined by three background exercisers, including one man, a woman who demonstrates many easier modifications, and another woman who demonstrates some more advanced modifications. This is definitely an intermediate-to-advanced exercise program. While beginners can modify by using very light weights and omit the more difficult pulses, the excess number of repetitions alone may still be too challenging for some. I would recommend that true beginners start with the original ""Get Ripped"" workout first, which can be more easily modified for a beginner level yet will still keep you feeling quite challenged throughout - then get this DVD once you've mastered the former.

Although I workout using a variety of exercise DVDs, ""Slim & Lean"" is currently the staple of my exercise program and has given me the overall best results so far. Bonus features include trailers for ""Get Ripped,"" ""Get Ripped to the Core"" (will be trying that one next!) and an interview with a dietition. Highly recommended!",1167609600,13,2464,4.990267639902676
2559516,1,B000FBFUEK,"I purchased Slim and Lean as well as Get Ripped to the Core along with 3 other workout DVD's from Amazon at the same time.  The only ones that didn't work were the Get Ripped DVD's.  Both Slim and Lean and Get Ripped to the Core are bad copies (both were NEW)and while playing either the DVD would stop and pause then resume or would play without the sound.  Thinking it was my DVD player, I inserted one of my other DVD's purchased at the same time, and all 3 worked just fine, no pausing, no stopping, sound was perfect.  I would have returned them, but I was passed the 30 days.  I would not even give these DVD 1 star but that was not a choice given.  Though the content looks like it would be a good workout, I wouldn't recommend buying them since the quality of the copy seems to be the issue.  If two separate DVD's are having a copying problem, I assume that there will be issues with other copies during the production phase.  I will be copying this review and sending it to Jari Love's website (if she has one) or the production company so they are aware of the situation.  Again, too bad, the workout looked good, but I was so frustrated with the lack of sound and intermitent pausing and starting that I quit watching.  If you need a decent workout and have a step, I would recommend The Firm.",1165449600,8,1305,4.246963562753036
2559517,4,B000FBFUEK,"I have done this workout quite often and find that it is very effective in slimming and toning the shape of your body.  You should alternate this with cardio to really get good results.

After repeated use, I will be honest, the video can get tedious with endless reps on each track.  I sometimes resort to playing other music in the background just to jazz things up.  Jari is a good instructor, not overly perky or obnoxious.

It is a good solid workout that you can grow with without having to constantly be switching equipment around all over the place, going crazy.",1163116800,11,570,4.549019607843137
2559518,4,B000FBFUEK,"I have been an avid fitness chick for about 5 years now and have done everything from the gym to home videos to personal trainers.  This video is the most effective workout I have ever experienced for tightening and toning muscles.  It is an excellent workout that keeps your heart rate up because of the high number of reps, so you know you are buring calories while you are tightening and toning.

It is about an hour long, but they time goes by quickly becuase it is broken up into several tracks - one for each muscle group.  This also makes it easy to navigate in case you just want to work specific groups that day.

The DVD also shows modifications for an easier or more difficult work out.  This is great for beginners and experts alike.

My only complaint is that it is not very visually appealing and that Jari has almost no personality, so she isn't very motivating.  But at least she doesn't annoy her watchers with over excitement!

I definitely recommend this product and will be buying more of Jari's DVDs in the future.",1160697600,10,1035,4.491978609625669
2559519,5,B000FBFUEK,"I did this workout for the first time this morning at 5:00 AM. I love this workout! I sweat buckets! It was tough! I can't wait until Saturday to do it again (I have to skip a day). If you want a good workout, this is it! The great thing about it is if you want more of a challenge all you have to do is increase the weight. I will update as I get results.",1160611200,7,356,3.6973684210526314
2559520,5,B000FBFUEK,"This has a lot of simple repetitions but with variations, so it's not boring and is quite fun and substantial.  It's important for the exercize to be fun; otherwise, I won't keep doing it.  It is broken down into many sections, and that makes an hour+ go very fast.  I like most of the background music in this DVD, and also like that Jary Love is not overly bubbly, which many female exercize gurus are and can sometimes be ridiculous.  Boy, she has some killer abs, and that is a good inspiration/example to aspire to.  I've done many different exercize programs and this is one of the best.  I really enjoy it and highly recommend it.",1160352000,6,637,4.448275862068965
2559521,5,B000FBFUEK,"Let me tell you how fabulous this video is! I actually got a workout! Let's face it; there are very few serious srength training videos out there. This one is just great! My only complaint is that it isn't split ino upper and lower. I like to divide my strength training rather than slaving away for an hour. Regardless, this is one of the best videos out there for people who don't alternate weights with soup cans! So much better than the Firm!",1159920000,13,446,4.385542168674699
2559522,4,B000FBFUEK,"As a new fan of Jari Love really enjoying her Ripped workout, I was excited to pick up her new workouts.  This one is definitely more advanced and intense, lots of reps here.  I am not used to this type of training as I generally do higher weight/lower rep workouts like the Firm and others, so I was wasted the first time I did this one, had to go majorly light on the weights too.

Jari is joined by Laurie and Krista, who were in the first Ripped workout along with Brian.  The transformations that Laurie and Krista have made since Ripped are quite inspiring.  You will need some dumbells for this workout, barbells and plate weights are also used by some of the participants.  This workout contains 12 tracks including warmup and stretch, each track has it's own song.  There is a preview for each exercise so you know what's coming, plus they show each exercisers weight load plus display the number of reps that will be performed.  I found this quite helpful.  Here is a listing of the exercises...

squats (76 reps plus pulsing)
lunges (front/back, 94 total plus pulsing)
chest presses (64 plus pulsing)
bent leg deadlifts/deadrows (30 deadlifts, 54 rows plus pulsing)
pushups/rotator cuff (45 pushups, 32 rotator cuff)
tricep dips/french press (24 dips, 56 french press)
bicep/hammer curls (46 curls plus pulsing, 36 hammer curls)
one leg squats/wide squats (44 one leg plus pulsing, 38 wide plus pulsing)
overhead press/lateral raise (34 overheads, 28 lateral)
abs

The warmup consists of some of the exercises you will see throughout the workout with really light weights.  Krista shows beginner modifications for a lot of the exercises, plus there are other options given throughout such as doing the lunges in a static or stationary position, which I do myself.  I used a range of 3-10 pound dumbells for this workout and it was plenty tough for me, as you can see there are lots and lots of reps, for some exercises maybe a few too many.  The chest track was especially tough for me.

Still, I give this workout 4 stars, I think over time and once I get used to this kind of training, I will like the results that I see.  Plus alternating light weight training with heavier weight training will shake things up a bit and keep things interesting. For those who thought that Ripped was too easy, Jari has come up with a challenge here.  She has done a nice job in this one, I have this one and her 2 other workouts, I do them all and look forward to the new ones she has coming out late this year/early next year.",1157846400,151,2525,4.587973273942094
2559523,5,B000FBFUEK,"I love this workout, it's straight forward with high reps and boy do you sweat.  The best part is you see the results happening so quickly.  I'm thrilled with this workout and look forward to her two new ones coming in October.  This is broken down into 5 minute segments with there being 10 segments in all, plus a warm up and cool down.  By the time I'm to the end I'm sweating and my heart rate is elevated.  Muscle burns a lot more calories then fat and with this workout and you using weights between 5 and 10 #'s you should be feeling it by the end.  Jari is a great instructor and I've already recommended this to several friends.",1157068800,6,637,4.223140495867769
2559524,5,B000FBFUEK,"Simple format here, one body part per song - there are no compound exercises here.  High rep format, and Jari encourages you to go as heavy on the weights as you can manage.  I found myself using 5, 8 and 10 lb. weights, although I did use 3 pounders at the end of the shoulder section.  I tended to start out heavier and then download halfway or farther into each section for the upper body stuff.  Good, thorough workout. There are three exercisers working with Jari, who show different modifications of the exercises. This workout is one you can certainly grow with by upping the weights used.  Ab section is very brief, and I found it too easy.  I will add ankle weights and/or a barbell plate on my chest next time.  Thorough stretch at the end, although the stretches aren't held very long.  Jari also does brief stretching for the body part worked after each section.  This workout would be great if you were in a time crunch.  The whole thing is about 60 min., but you can pick and choose the exercises you want to do, so you can customize it to the body part(s) you want to work and adjust it to the amount of time you have. The workout is certainly not ""rah rah"" exciting and a ton of fun, but the time does go by quickly because although you work one body part per track, you do several different exercises for that body part so you are often switching what you are doing.  Music was fine - nothing to write home about, but it had a good, steady beat which is needed for the workout.  Jari is encouraging, but it would be nice if she'd smile more and look like she was having some fun instead of just putting in her time!  Otherwise, she's a good instructor.  Form instructions are given at the beginning of each track, and Jari gives reminders throughout the workout.",1153958400,10,1779,4.367781155015198

I've worked out to Jari Love's first Get Ripped DVD which prepared me for the more intense work out of Slim & Lean.  Jari reminds you to watch your form, push yourself and follow a nutritious diet to get the results you want, it is as if she is right next to you the whole time.  I am getting those results and I couldn't do it without the Get Ripped series! Thanks Jari!",1153267200,4,501,3.8823529411764706

I walk and do interval running 3 days a week and wanted to do resistance training the other 2 days.  If you want cardio, this isn't the workout for you.  The pushups are really tough if you do them off your toes, but I'm 67 and can still do them (a little faster than they do them so I can complete).

8120132,4,B000FBFUEK,"This is the first Jari Love DVD I've ever done.  I heard she was similar in style to Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper and Jackie Warner who are stables in my small collection of workout DVDs.  I thought I'd give her a try!

First of all, I think it should be made clear that this is probably NOT a weight loss DVD, not that there's anything wrong with that!  I think that we should be more focused on our physical health than the way the scale moves, but there is no cardio in this DVD.  That's not really a secret though--somehow I had overlooked it when I purchased it.  This is a 100% strength training DVD.

Secondly, it is long.  It's over an hour and it feels like it.  That's not necessarily a bad thing--sometimes I work out to clear my own head and it's a good one to ""zone out to"" (save me the lecture, I know you're supposed to stay engaged, but sometimes it's easy to drift off!)  Some of the sections feel impossibly long.  I always found myself wondering when the squats and chest press section would last.

I only found a few segments very challenging.  The triceps section was the hardest for me.  It did feel some soreness in my butt and my shoulders.  I used from 5-8 pound weights.  I was surprised to see how much weight Jari and her exercisers were using.  This work out also utilizes a step, which I didn't know--but it was easy enough to use a chair.  I also used hand weights as opposed a barbell.

It's a good DVD and I definitely saw some results, but it is very no-frills.  Jari is very straight-forward.  She does some very minimal coaching.  Her assistants have fantastic form and don't whine and complain and collapse and goof around like I've seen on other DVDs, which was kind of a nice change.  I really liked her ab segment and I LOVED the lengthy cooldown.  It's one of the best cooldowns I've ever seen on a DVD.

Basically, this is a good strength trainer for beginners--but I found all the repetitive motions a little boring, but that's the kind of training that this is.  Low weight, high reps--and if you stick with it, you will see results!  Don't worry about the scale!",1482710400,3,2107,4.377260981912145
