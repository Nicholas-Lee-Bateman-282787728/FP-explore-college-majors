8339988,3,B001SLNPU2,"I RENETED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IM A FAN OF FREDDRO STARR AND HE WAS ON THE COVER.  BUT HE IS NOT EDDIE BLACK.  EDDIE BLACK IS A GOOD GUY TRYING TO BECOME A LAWYER.  BUT HIS FRIENDS ARE INVOLVED IN A GANG.  CAN EDDIE KEEP RUNNING WITH THE CAN AND NOT GET INVOLED IN GAND ACTIVITY?  AND IF HE CONTINUSES TO HANG WITH HIS FRIEND WILL HE EVER BECOME A LAWYER?  YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO FIND OUT.  THE MOVIE IS FULL IF BAD ACTORS.  BUT THE DUDE DANIEL PHILIP , WHO PLAYS EDDIE IS A GOOD NEW COMER AND IS VERY SEXY!  (DANIEL IF YOU READ THIS REVIEW HOLLA AT YOUR GIRL DOWN HERE IN JACKSONVILLE FL!! I WOULD HOLLA. CHECK MY PROFILE)  BUT OVERALL THE MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING AT LEAST ONCE.",1251763200,,685,3.9705882352941178
