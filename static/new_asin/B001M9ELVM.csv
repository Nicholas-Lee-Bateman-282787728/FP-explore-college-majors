I am writing a chapter of my PhD dissertation on this film, which is why I've seen the movie over and over again. I think I liked it better the first time. Loriga tends to be quite pretentious, especially as a director, and the performance of Daniel Gonzalez is abysmal...  I just can't stand him. But I must admit that I might have seen this movie way too many times.",1476489600,,526,4.207920792079208
8320662,4,B001M9ELVM,"A couple days in the life of a person you don't want to know. This movie showcases the carelessness of violence and emotional detachment from others and the world. Boy shoots people, girl follows boy to ends of earth because she really has no life or desires of her own beyond the moment and the boy, and boy runs out of road to run in the end.

If you are like me and saw this just for Viggo Mortensen- his appearance is good but too short. Viggo the butcher. Soundtrack is also OK for a B movie.",1281398400,7,497,4.123711340206185
