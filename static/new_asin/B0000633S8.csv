1687832,2,B0000633S8,"While the animation may not be up to snuff in this movie, the worst part is the writing.  Basically, the story has Lupin at the bedside of an old, dying underworld boss.  This boss gives Lupin an odd-shaped purple diamond called the Twilight Gemini.  Apparently it is the key to a vast treasure in Morocco.  So off Lupin goes followed by Inspector Zenigata.  The rest of Lupin's gang shows up for whatever reason and don't do much for the movie except show up.  Things are rather boring and uninteresting and when the end comes, it is a relief!
People with below-average intelligence will QUICKLY be able to figure out where the other half of the diamond is and who the chief bad guy really is.  So, to make up for their bad writing, animated nudity is inserted.  It is here that we see the Japanese love of fetishes such as large-breasted women, transvestites, and B&D.  They found many opportunities to show Fujiko nude (topless) whenever the story becomes unwatchable.  And just so Fujiko isn't the only one forced to lose her clothes, they have the character of Lara lose hers!
Characters are butchered here.  Fujiko in ""Castle of Cagliostro"" is smart.  She's been working undercover for a long time to try to make a huge score.  When Lupin shows up, she aides him only because it helps her to do so.  So she's sexy, smart, and classy.  In ""Twilight Gemini"", Fujiko is reduced to an ignorant slut who uses sex to try to get information out of Lupin to find out why he's here.  Her only purpose is to show her naked breasts at various times, nothing more.
While there should be a purpose for Jigen being here, he really has no purpose.  The writers try to make up one but it is so weak as to be laughable.  And then Goemon's purpose is only to fight the transvestite bad guy who apparently trained with Goemon at some point.  Goemon supposedly has been on this person's trail for some time.  Yeah, whatever.
Just horrible writing is the plague here.  Obviously this was slapped together since the studio that made this movie just wanted a Lupin product out.  If you are a hard-core Lupin fan who want's to add to their Lupin collection, go ahead and get this.  Otherwise, I'd skip this one.",1032048000,8,2193,4.538265306122449
1687833,4,B0000633S8,"Funny, and does not take itself seriously.  Lupin is occasionally over done when showing emotion, but if you enjoyed Castle of Cagliostro, then you will enjoy this one also.",1025049600,3,173,4.9655172413793105
1687834,2,B0000633S8,"Lupin III (aka Rupan 3, aka Wolf) was created by Japanese comic strip artist Monkey Punch in the mid 60's. He's the grandson of Arsene Lupin, the original gentleman thief created in 1906 by French mystery writer Maurice Leblanc, and later typified by Raffles and Simon Templar (The Saint).
Between 1971 and 1985, Lupin III appeared in over 200 half-hour episodes on Japanese TV. The first of six theatrical features was released in 1978, and a series of feature-length specials (13 so far) have appeared on Japanese TV annually since 1989. However, aside from poor quality, unlicensed copies, American audiences have only seen four of the features, and a mere two episodes (see the videos ""Tales of the Wolf"" and ""Lupin III's Greatest Capers"").
Lupin fans who have been eagerly awaiting this new video release will be disappointed. ""The Secret of Twilight Gemini"" (the 8th TV special, originally aired in 1996) features all the usual characters, but the story is so typical of Lupin as to be entirely uninspired. But the worse thing about it is the crudeness of the animation, even by American standards. This one was obviously made on a budget.
Newcomers to Lupin III may still find this enjoyable, but for much better examples, see the classics ""The Mystery of Mamo"" or ""The Castle of Cagliostro"".",1021334400,2,1299,4.936073059360731

A nice feature of the DVD is that you can choose between the original Japanese soundtrack (with or without English subtitles) or the English dubbed version, and the titles and other onscreen text can be switched from Japanese to English via the ""angle"" button of your DVD player.",1021334400,19,1577,4.910112359550562
7958572,5,B0000633S8,the uncut dvd came in great i replace the edited one i had with this one i ordered,1515110400,,82,3.611111111111111
7958573,4,B0000633S8,"Rather great that I got the Uncut version of this otherwise fun, but average Lupin the 3rd TV movie. Funimation went all 4Kids on us with a childish edited version that puts digital bras on naked women like they are trying hard to market this to kids or something. The list of edits to the other version are numerous and for some reason Funimation messed up and put that version in one of their first run box sets of the movies.

But it begs to say why in world did they even try to edited this movie? What was the reason? They didn't do this to the other TV specials and movies, why this one?

Thankfully it's quite easy to tell the ones apart on DVD, the edited has no subtitle under it's title. The Uncut DVD at least has a subtitle to indicate it is the uncut version. Bad news is that most likely the sellers on here won't know which one is which and or won't care and will give either version.

I lucked out.

By the way, the subtitles are a little different, on the language menu pick ""Japanese with Japanese subtitles"" instead of ""Japanese with English Subtitles. As the Japanese subtitles are the actual translated English dialogue for the Japanese version, the English one is well the English Dub script transcribed for your enjoyment for some reason. The dialogue doesn't match up and I realized I should have picked the other subs.

The Dub for this thing is horrendous as usual. It's not even as good as the Tony Oliver/Richard Epcar dub that Geneon put out for the second series and the first movie.

But the selling of a edited version to this, is just mind boggling. What were they thinking? Edits to violence, sexual content and even minor language, it's ridiculous.",1452470400,,1683,4.483660130718954

7958575,4,B0000633S8,"While I am in no way lacking in appreciation for what FUNimation has done to bring some great Lupin III films to an English-speaking audience, I have to say they have done an egregious disservice to ""The Secret of Twilight Gemini.""  I must confess that this is not the greatest of the Lupin III TV specials, but it is very enjoyable and it certainly deserved better treatment than this.

I never watch dubbed anime if I can avoid it, but the misleading audio menu led me to watch the Japanese audio with dub-titles from the English script ('English sub-titles' on the menu do not get you English sub-titles, they get you dub-titles, and you need to select 'Japanese sub-titles' to get real English sub-titles).  I was stunned by what I was seeing.  All reference to the sexual orientation of Sadachiyo, one of the main villains, had been removed, and even his spare character profile amongst the 'Extras' makes no mention.  This means that without prior knowledge of the Japanese-language plot, viewers will be far less likely to pick up on the crush Sadachiyo has on Goemon and that he sees Lupin as a potential romantic rival, so when he says he specifically took this job in order to kill Lupin, there is no explanation whatsoever and then Goemon 'happens' to appear for only the most threadbare of reasons.  This is dreadful storytelling, employing contrivance and deus ex machina, and is the sort of thing one shows to the Screenwriting 101 class as an example of how not to write.  If FUNimation didn't have the gumption to deal with a gay character, or that said character's orientation has nothing to do with why Goemon is angry with him, then they shouldn't have chosen to undertake this particular project.  Their disastrous dubbing script has taken a film that is obviously a light-hearted send-up of the grand Hollywood epic (complete with a tragic love triangle - albeit an unexpected one) and turned it onto a muddled, poorly-conceived mess.  It's a shame, really.

My recommendation is that viewers do not watch this dubbed at all.  Watch it in Japanese with the English sub-titles - the real ones, not the dub-titles.  That way the movie can be enjoyed as it was originally intended, and not panned for being the poorly-written schlock that FUNimation turned it into.

Another aspect of this movie to consider is the unusual (for Lupin III) take on character design and animation direction.  Sugii Gisaburo is a highly experienced and talented director who usually undertakes projects based on the works of manga great Osamu Tezuka (Sugii worked on ""Dororo"" and ""Tetsuwan Atomu"" aka ""Astro Boy"") and adaptations of extremely popular sports mangas like ""Touch"" and ""Nine.""  His style is a departure from that employed by more modern action-oriented directors, and while it may not seem so, he is not a complete stranger to Lupin III.  He was an animator on the original Lupin III pilot films from 1969.  I personally enjoy seeing a different take on the characters from time to time.",1400716800,,2998,4.847058823529411
7958576,5,B0000633S8,Another great movie of lupin the third. It's so funny and witty and action pack. I love watching lupin the third.,1363910400,,113,4.428571428571429
7958577,5,B0000633S8,"I have only seen two Lupin films, so you can call this a review from someone who is new.

Being the 8th film in the series, Lupin the 3rd is as popular to Anime as James Bond is popular to Hollywood movies.

Both Lupin and James Bond share allot in common, they pick up allot of ladies.

They are always solving mysteries that involve corrupt people who desire for power.

But the major different is, Lupin is a thief from France, James is a Brittish Spy.

So that would explain why Lypin is able to pick up all the chiks then.

OK, so anyway, Lupin is given half of a dimond from an old family friend who is suffering from ill health and the old guy asks Lupin to go and find the Geltic treasure.

Allong the way, a the usual detective who tries to catch Lupin in every movie is at it again often trying to catch Lupin for his theifory acts. But this time there is this French Commissioner who is also after Lupin (for reasons not to be explained as they give away allot of the story line)

Then there are usual Lupin characters, especilly this blonde lady who always seems to be in the same place as Lupin on her own missions and they happen to get into bed together only to be interupted before the fun starts.

But as always, Lupin the 3rd is NOT a Hentai, even though there are breasts exposed, they are nothing more than just Ecchi material.

The real highlight is with one special character by the name of Laura who lives as a Geltic girl who is fighting for the freedom of her people in Morroco.

For anyone who likes Quicksand in Anime, Lupin the 3rd - The Secret of Twilight Gemini has one ripper of a quicksand peril moment that is to be soon to be believed as Lupin tries to save the sinking Laura by stripping down to his boxes and trying to make a rope out of his clothes.

It is a really touching scene and one that is one of those Lupin moments when you feel that this girl has fallen in love with the French thief.

Allong with many funny (and perverted) moments, I really enjoyed this movie of Lupin the 3rd.

But in the end, that is only just my opinion.

I found this movie when someone told me where the quicksand scene came from on YouTube so I was really happy to enjoy buying this while I had the name to guide me.

And to top it all off, for those who want a beautiful Belly Dancer dancing in the creddits, well this one has just the type of creddit scenes you are looking for.

Overall, an enjoyable Anime and it has brought my interest in Lupin the 3rd.",1209513600,,2480,4.176470588235294
7958578,4,B0000633S8,"Legend has it that the Twilight diamond is the key to a Moroccan treasure of immeasurable value. So when the international thief Lupin is given the Twilight in an act of faith, it's off to Morroco!

This movie may be old but it's on DVD it's supposed to have a sharp image. The sound is fairly decent, my least favorite thing is it doesn't have the same voice acting as the TV series.

I'm inspired by Lupin being an international thief. I'm from a small town name Winnsboro, Louisiana and it's boring. I want to travel all over the world and steal.",1140998400,,549,4.372549019607843
7958579,4,B0000633S8,"If everyone compares every Lupin movie with The Castle of Cagliostro (CoG) then of course all the other movies might seem bad. But CoG is what it is and the same goes for The Secret of the Twilight Gemini. Gemini is yet another adventure about searching for lost treasure, but this one is unique from the TV episodes because it has time to develop the story and it does quite well. Although the characters are not as light hearted and zany like CoG, they still are fun to watch. A couple gripes however I have with this film. Zenigata was not nearly as funny or really that involved as he could of been. Sometimes Zenigata's involvement in a TV episode or movie can make or break the episode, in this case it doesn't break it but he is a character that the Lupin fan most likely has grown to love. Overall this film is fun to watch but sometimes times to take itself too seriously (i.e flashbacks in silent movie format) but this part is most likely a spoof. Anyhow, if you are a Lupin fan and watch the show then you should pick this one up, its a fun ride all the way through.",1057104000,,1078,4.263414634146342
7958580,3,B0000633S8,"This movie is the usual Lupin the 3rd movie, not too much different than all the others. The story is the down-side of the movie, in my oponion it's an over-used plot, searching for treasure basically. The animation is not bad, the typical Lupin the 3rd animation. The music is not bad either much better than Akira, and kinda catchy. Overall if you like Lupin the 3rd there's no reason why you wouldn't like this movie!",1049500800,,420,4.5394736842105265
7958581,2,B0000633S8,"This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting.
The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villian and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging.
Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing.
The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.",1036886400,7,914,4.828025477707007
