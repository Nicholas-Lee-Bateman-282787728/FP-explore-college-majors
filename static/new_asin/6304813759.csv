928934,5,6304813759,"The Full Monty is a funny movie with well developed characters and a great plot. I enjoyed it thouroughly and it really made me laugh. One of the best movies out there. Buy it if you don't already own it. Bill Robinson, Genius  at Work",926208000,,235,4.222222222222222
928935,5,6304813759,"I HAVE SEEN THIS PICTURE NEARLY TWENTY TIMES AND NEVER TIRE OF IT.  IT IS HILARIOUS, TENDER IN SOME SPOTS.  THE PART WHERE THEY ARE IN LINE AND DONNA SUMMER'S ""HOT LOVE"" COMES ON IS PRICELESS.  THE ACTORS ARE ALL  OUTSTANDING.",924048000,2,226,4.439024390243903
928936,5,6304813759,"Top comedy combining from-the-belly laughs with subtle social commentary.  Played at a theatre in my small city [40,000] for an unprecedented SIX months thanks to word-of-mouth.  A must see!  The relationship between Gaz  & his kid, the overweight guy [Mark Addy] and his wife, even Gaz and  his ex-wife are compelling.  I don't know how the Brits do it, but  characters who have only one line are so believable and memorable, e.g. the  clerk at the unemployment counter, having heard rumors the group is going  to strip at a club, looks up with such a look when the guy tells her he  hasn't worked and says 'That's not what I heard.'  Her only line and she  becomes a real person.  By the way, this year's sleeper is 'Little Voice'  with Michael Caine.",920592000,3,753,4.606060606060606
928937,5,6304813759,"Despite the attention given to the stripper motif, this movie is about life, desperation, and the evolution of friendship in the most unlikely ways. The cast are average joes in every way, yet as the viewer comes to  know them, each shines. It also paints a bull's eye on our obsession with  body image and strikes home with every line.
The Yorkshire slang and  dialect are hard to grasp at first, but you'll want to see this one again  and again.",915321600,2,447,4.481481481481482
928938,5,6304813759,This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  I know many guys who don't want to see this movie because they are strippers but it is just so funny that I didn't care. If you haven't seen this movie before you  have to! The plot is interesting and its just hilarious.,913852800,2,282,4.017857142857143

929099,5,6304813759,"I liked this film when it came out at the theatre and I still like this film today.  Besides being a great British Comedy, the film also touches on serious subjects such as unemployment, fathers' rights, depression, impotence, homosexuality, body image, blue collar class culture, and suicide.  A film well worth seeing, especially if you keep an open mind when seeing it.",1513987200,2,372,4.983870967741935

929105,4,6304813759,I gave this 4 stars only because it was a little difficult to understand the British speaking at the beginning of this movie. We did start to understand the different characters after a few minutes. My husband and I feel that this was very funny because it takes place in Britain and it took us a while to get to know the characters. We both were laughing and laughing especially toward the end of the movie!!! both feel that it wouldn't have as been funny if we had watched the American version because we would have known and understood the American English language in that movie. We highly recommend viewing this movie!!,1506902400,,624,4.580357142857143

The extras weren't anything more than what you would normally find on a DVD now. However, since it was made before extras were included I guess it is more than an original release.
There was no full Monty, just saying.",1484265600,,394,4.266666666666667

929448,5,6304813759,"A truly great film. You'll rent it for the feel-good comedy and the joy of watching a bunch of losers put together a chippendales show. You'll like for the attaching characters. You'll remember it from the more profound aspects of the movie as it analyzes the decline of masculinity in a post-industrial steel city. Much, much better than ""The commitments"", another movie about a band of misfits trying to make it big in the entertainment world.",1483574400,2,445,4.868421052631579

929566,5,6304813759,Robery Carlyle is a talented gentleman.  I've loved his work everywhere I've encountered it.  The Full Monty is a riot.  Who'd think a premise founded on grown men thrown out of work without prospects would lead to laughs but what they build on the premise is superb and is full of merriment.  It is the human spirit at its indomitable best.  And that Tom Jones song on which the picture closes is PERFECT.,1475280000,3,406,4.506849315068493

930112,4,6304813759,"Sheffield England, 1996 or thereabouts. A town that 25 years before was prosperous with its' steel manufacturing plants is now shuttered & gloomy, with very little employment opportunities for the now-laid-off workers.

Single dad Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is inspired by the visiting Chippendale's Dancers to do the same, only better. He engages his best friend Dave (Mark Addy) & new friend Lomper (Steve Huison) to form a group of Yorkshire strippers. Along the way they manage to recruit former supervisor Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), Horse (Paul Barber) & Guy (Hugo Speer) to complete their troupe. But mum's the word; no one outside their little company needs to know they'll be doing 'The Full Monty' (ie, stripping completely), not even the manager of the local workingman's club that they book to debut in.

Dave is self-conscious about his weight. As he says in one scene where an anti-wrinkle cream is being discussed, 'there's no anti-fat-bastard cream'.  Lomper & Guy form a romantic attachment, while Gerald has yet to tell his missus that he's been unemployed for the past 6 months. Simon Beaufoy wrote the excellent script, but it wouldn't have meant much without the uniformly excellent performances.

Robert Carlyle especially stands out as Gaz. A consummate character actor, it's hard to believe that this is the same man who portrayed Begby in 'Trainspotting'. Tom Wilkinson turns in a strong performance as Gerald, while the supporting characters of Lomper, Guy, Dave, & Jean (Lesley Sharpe) all shine. The locations (filmed around Sheffield) are all suitably grimy & dilapidated.

Will the group 'Hot Metal' actually DO 'The Full Monty' at their debut? Let's just say the choice of music ('You Can Leave Your Hat On' sung by Joe Cocker) is appropriate for the ending!

'The Full Monty' definitely holds up to repeated viewings. Buy the DVD or digital download & see for yourself. You won't regret it!",1442534400,,1912,5.092651757188499

It's 25 years later - and Gary 'Gaz' Schofield and David 'Dave' Horsefall (Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy) are on their way home from an unsuccessful plunder run in the disused Steel Works Factory they were employed in ten years earlier (stealing 20 girders to pay maintenance money). They see a huge queue of local lasses excitedly waiting outside the Millthorpe Working Men's Club to see a strip gig by a visiting male troupe - The Chippendales. These six-pack dancing lotharios will be there `For One Night Only' - all buffed up, covered in Johnson's baby oil and wearing tiny detachable red leather sarongs around their presumably mighty nether regions. ""Waving his tackle at your missus!"" Gaz ruminates to Dave - appalled and amazed at such a thought. But back at the Job Club (which never has any jobs) - Gaz and his mates calculate that at 10 per punter - times a thousand screaming girlies - that's a lot of wonga that our unemployed Sex Gods don't have stuffed down into their well manky Marks & Spencer Y-Fronts.

To make matters worse - Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape) is with his ex-wife Mandy (the lovely Emily Woof) who is shacking up with a 'decent' man - Alan. Alan has a job (Dave Hill), a home and can afford the 700 a month it costs to raise a child. Besides - although he loves him - young Nate is tired of Dad's excuses, scams and getting by. Gaz now knows that he will need to pull out all the stops to keep his son - but he also twigs that in order to outdo the muscle-bound competition - he and his crew of Little and Large lookalikes (who call themselves HOT METAL) will have to pull out a bit more than a stop - they'll need to get their entire kit off - and do The Full Monty. An idea is planted, secret striptease practice begins in living rooms and disused warehouses to Hot Chocolate's ""You Sexy Thing"" - and soon a lithesome pep is returned to their disco-dancing step...

When ""The Full Monty"" was released into British cinemas in 1997 - it took the country by storm. It was brutally funny, topically apt and down to earth. And despite its dark back-story about the sapping effect of unemployment - it was properly uplifting in a way that only ballsy English comedy can be. But most of all - it had what the British Government has never had - genuine heart.

So many scenes in this film are gigglesome funny  - the striptease to ""Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus"" by a man about as sexy as an Orang-Utan picking his nose, discussing ways of effectively killing yourself after they've saved the ginger-haired wimp Lomper (Steve Hulson) from gassing himself in his clapped-out Cortina, their former Foreman and Boss Gerald (a stunning turn by Tom Wilkinson) worrying about getting a stiffy in front of 400 women like he did when he was a kid of 13 in a swimming pool full of teenage girls, the ageing black man Horse (Paul Barber) bemoaning the lack of results from a penis-pump in a red telephone box, Guy (Hugo Speer) dropping his pants and revealing his ample dangler (""The lunchbox has landed!""), the boys swaying their hips and behinds to Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" as the dole queue shuffles forward...

But then it touches you too - cooking a curry on a hot engine head because they're broke and hungry, the girls using the men's toilets at the Chippendales gig when Dave's wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) stops laughing and says of her husband ""It's like he's given up...work...me...everything..."" But especially when Lomper's aging Mum dies and he plays the trumpet at her funeral accompanied by The British Steel Stockbridge Brass Band to a truly gorgeous version of ""Abide With Me"" (not a dry eye in the house).

Having watched the DVD before the BLU RAY - I'm thrilled to say that the picture quality is vastly improved. It's beautiful - and that's not something you'd say of a film like this (it was never meant to be a looker). There isn't a scratch or a speck to be seen and the steadiness of the image and the extra oomph in the mix allows both the picture and music to punch way above its weight (a top transfer).

The Extras are pleasingly indepth - Two Commentaries - one by Director Peter Cattaneo and Actor Mark Addy- the other by Principal Producer Uberto Pasolini. There are 1998 interviews with actors Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Hugo Speer, Paul Barber, Steve Hulson and even a very young William Snape beside himself to have gotten the child gig.  There are Deleted Scenes, nearly 15 different trailers in various publicity campaigns, a function called ""Music Machine"" that allows you play one or all of the songs featured in the film, Derek Malcolm interviews with Producer Uberto Pasolini and Backer Lindsay Law (of Fox Searchlight), Director Peter Cattaneo, Writer Simon Beaufoy and actor Tom Wilkinson. There's even stuff of the aftermath of the film and its success.

AUDIO is English 5.1 DTS-HD, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian 5.1 DTS, Castellano 5.1 DTS. SUBTITLES are English For The Deaf and Hard Of Hearing, Portuguese, Japanese, Castellano, Italian, Spanish and Japanese. Coding is ABC so all regions.

Mark Addy's character is Dave - the plumpest of the bunch and the most embarrassed about his body shape. In front of his wife - he breaks down and admits his fears - ""Well look at me! Janey - who wants to see 'this' dance?"" She tenderly steps up to him, puts her hands on his face and says - ""Me Dave. I do.""

""The Full Monty"" is a fabulous film - just as funny and as moving as you remember it. It received 4 Academy Nominations in 1998 including Best Film - and now in 2013 - it finally has the format to do it proud.

In our own tough economic times this movie resonates as never before -- no jobs for men who want to work.  The parallels to today are too real, but this movie is no downer -- far from it.  It is about as uplifting (pun intended) as it can be -- a fine tonic for today's still bleak long-term unemployment numbers.  Watch it and be renewed with hope for a better tomorrow!

One of the best scenes, and indeed, the pivotal point of the film involves no spoken words whatsoever.  Just a scene of the six unemployed steel workers back in the ""job club"" unemployment line as Donna Summers' ""Hot Stuff"" comes on over the radio.  At first the men, who are in different places in the line, barely, almost imperceptibly twitch to the song's throbbing beat.  Twitches slowly morph into the carefully rehearsed, synchronized and choreographed moves of the gents' dance routine, ending with a flourish as their former foreman reaches the front of the line!

She has developed a strong admiration of Robert Carlyle, who plays the leading role, and that led us to <i>Stargate Universe</i> which pleased us both (although the science is looser that loose).

Its wonderfully funny with touching parts as well.
Men who have become statistics of the environment of corporate greed, look for ways to survive - each in their own ways - and keep body and mind together.
How they so innocently slip into their solution is subtle yet very humorous.
Watching them perfect their new-found talents is hilarious.
It may seem somewhat understated but it is only a dry sense of humour for the most part as there are real issues being dealt with in a jocular fashion here.
A friend said she had difficulty with the accent, but I did not.  There may be a term or so with which one might not be familiar, but within the context of the story, they can be figured out (or Googled).  To those familiar with the Sheffield accent, there may be some disconnect in that the accents may not be spot on, but to most everyone else, that would most likely not be noticeable in the least.
Only a few of the actors will be familiar to an American audience, but that should not detract from enjoyment of the piece as they all do an excellent, effortless job in their portrayals.
It shows what people can learn to and be willing to do to make ends meet, but in a harmless, humorous way.  There is no backstreet gang activity etc. here.  Its just all very grand fun and touching.",1375142400,,1300,4.381742738589212

931238,5,6304813759,"As a college professor steeped in social theory, I ignored this film until it was brought to my attention through the writings of feminist geographers, Julie Graham and Katherine Gibson, who discuss this film in their last book, ""A Postcapitalist Politics.""  On the surface, this film is appealing in a number of ways, from the slapstick comedy to the provocative promise of ""the full monty,"" itself!  But social scientists could--and should--appreciate this film for its exploration of how identities (masculine and feminine) are currently being transformed via the ongoing process of ""de-industrialization"" in ""first-world"" countries.  At its core, this film is about unemployed men learning to experience an all-too-often unavailable sense of joy in their freedom from the daily grind of wage labor for someone else's profit.

  Gibson-Graham, the academic authors, contrast this film with another film about the emasculation of unemployed workers in England:  the flim, ""Brassed Off"" (released during the same time period).  If you liked ""The Full Monty,"" you should definitely watch ""Brassed Off,"" and vice versa.

Each character has their own reason for taking part in this crazy idea, but Gaz's reason is the most heartfelt--he needs the money so he can keep seeing his kid. I was so happy that this wasn't just a ""stripper"" movie; it has its own realistic plot that I think anyone would enjoy. The film touches on all kinds of hardships (lack of work, low self esteem/insecurity, desperation), but also touches on the strong friendship that eventually builds between these different characters. Every actor in this film really hit it out of the park, most notably Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy. If you're looking for a touching yet hilarious film, look no further. You really feel for these characters and I definitely found myself cheering on with the audience at the end of the film.

I love the heart of this movie: the relationship between Gaz and Nathan and the friendship among the six men who really come to care about one another through tough times. Robert Carlyle is always at his best when he's playing a dad fighting for his child, and the short exchange between him and Nathan in which they shoulder-punch one another and wind up hugging almost made me cry. Yes, the six men get naked at the very end of the movie, but that's really incidental to the honest emotion of their relationships and the genuinely funny parts: Robert Carlyle, swaddled in a blanket in the police station, swearing with a straight face that they were stealing pipes ""in the buff"" was hysterical.

931698,5,6304813759,"`The Full Monty' is one of those films that remains enjoyable no matter how far removed you are from the date of its release.  The themes presented, the witty dialog and the overwhelming emotional feeling you get from the film's resounding finale will leave you wanting more (or at least to watch the film again).

The film tells the story of a bunch of unemployed steel workers in England trying to make sense of their unemployment and put together a way to provide for themselves and their families.  Each man contends with his own drawbacks, insecurities and personal dilemmas, but they all come together in a way that highlights the loyalties of friendships.  When it is decided that they are going to put on a Chippendale's inspired strip-show things take off in unexpected directions.  Their decision challenges everyone involved, but not just in the physicality of it all (they are out of shape and unfamiliar with `technique') but also in the emotional, for it pushes them and their loved ones in uncomfortable positions.

The great thing about `The Full Monty' is that is beautifully meshes both the comedic and the dramatic to create a fully fleshed out portrayal of real human bonds, struggles and triumphs.  The cast is hugely responsible for this, and they excel in beautiful ways.  Robert Carlyle carries the film rather well, giving it a hefty push with his dry wit and unexpected charm.  It is the supporting cast though, namely Tom Wilkinson and Mark Addy, who really make this film so special.  Their depth of conveyance is seen in every scene they embody, especially Addy who just creates such a moving and haunting portrayal of a man desperate to feel worthy of what he has.

This is a smart comedy that we weren't expecting, but one that we embrace and cherish.  It has become a recognizable piece of cinema today, but sadly many only really consider this as a `comedy about male strippers' and it really is so much more than that.  Those who haven't seen this may snicker at the film's title and jeer at its premise, but this film has so much more heart than one would expect.

So very worth it!",1339718400,,2117,4.717391304347826

There is something to be said about the friendships that this movie illustrates, in some ways it reminds me of Waking Ned Devine in that its rare that we see movies about men and actual friendships. By now you know the story of these men and their quest to add a few quid to their wallets by trying their luck in an unexpected way. Its a fun filled movie. Yes, the English accents can be hard to follow at times but well worth it.

Now for the bad. The dvd arrived in the cheapest case I've ever seen, an ""Eco-Case"" (yes this was purchased new directly from Amazon). I opened the wrapper to find the case already broken in half! Ok, I can get past that I suppose but what I can't get past is that while the dvd is advertised as being wide-screen (1.85:1 ratio)the movie was very small on my tv, basically it was two-thirds size. At first I though there was something wrong with my blu-ray player or tv but I checked it using other movies and no problems. What's even more aggravating is that the disc menu fills the screen and for that matter the trailer is shown in full screen mode. Aggravating. Yes, I am used to the letter box but this is not acceptable. I will be discussing with Amazon regarding an exchange, anyone else having this issue?

This team of amateur strippers all with their own story and unique personalities are believable and entertaining.  Respectable Gerald, played by Tom Wilkinson, masquerades his unemployment by dressing to go to work each day and not telling his wife the truth. This act of deception I can relate to, as I tried it when I was fired from my first job out of high school! This is a warm fantastic film, which has actually inspired a lot of people to strip to support charities. Following the release of this movie in 1997 there was a wave of strip acts all for good causes. After 14-years I still enjoy this film a lot, and I'm sure you will too.

931707,5,6304813759,'The Full Monty' is a priceless comedy featuring a great cast.  A group of unemployed middle aged men who are a bit down on their luck- and their self esteem- decide to do a one-night-only on-stage bit as male strippers and give their audience 'the full monty' to make a lot of cash fast.  Robert Carlyle and his co-stars deliver a lot of laughs to be had again and again in this one-of-a-kind British comedy.,1301875200,3,409,4.44
931812,5,6304813759,"Times are hard for six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed and now they're desperate for money.  A one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, so they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting they'll go completely nude!  The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night.

This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know:  One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been out of work for six months.  All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to ""Hot Stuff.""

Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope.  The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun.  This fast-paced and sweet film was made with a tiny budget but went on to break UK box office records.  Highly recommended.",1283472000,3,1311,4.714912280701754

Being from the Missouri Ozarks, the Yorkshire accents in the movie couldn't be further from what my ears are accustomed to hearing, but in no way did that interfere with my thorough enjoyment of this film. It is warm, sweet, a bit melancholy, and touching while managing to avoid being sappy...and absolutely hilarious.

The key is the situations in which the characters find themselves that are funny and not so much the characters themselves.  The result is believability and dignity of each character, even while they find themselves in very undignified circumstances.

As a side note, The ""translator"" section in the Special Features is puzzling to me because they translate slang terms with which most Americans are already familiar, i.e., ""DIY,"" ""tw-t,"" etc., but leave out British oddities that are unknown in the USA, such as ""chuffing Nora"" ""kit,"" and ""taking the piss"" and some terms that, after repeated viewings, still sound like gobbledygook to the average American.  No matter. Everyone I know who has seen the film understood what was going on.

This film is not raunchy, tacky, or vulgar, so do not let the premise put you off.  It is a lovely story about human beings discovering their dignity in the midst of very undignified circumstances.  Highly, highly recommended.",1256688000,11,1561,5.0505836575875485

One tried suicide and was thwarted by several others.  None of them would have considered the strip act but for their situations.  So their attempts at learning to dance, pick out the right music, and have the nerve to step out on stage were hilarious.

I have to admit to watching it twice because of the British accents and expressions. The best part is watching the reactions of the guys, and then the ladies. It's a romp to be enjoyed.

932030,5,6304813759,"There are now people who use the phrase `the full monty' who have never heard of, much less seen this witty, low-key film. The expression means `to do something completely and without reserve'. It originates in the story line: a group of recently-unemployed men in sooty olde England decide to form a Chippendales style dance troupe. Their plan, at the end of their act, is to remove the last velcroed jock-strap and expose `the full monty'.
The story line is crowded with the usual film tropes: relationships with family and friends are strained and tested. The men, initially overwhelmed by the decay of the industry that's been their livelihood gain strength as they take arms (and legs and torsos) against their sea of troubles. The men themselves are charming and their story is inspiring.
It is worth noting that ""FULLY EXPOSED EDITION"" is a canard. The ending reminds us just how daring their plan really is-it was too shocking to be shown on film.

Yes, it's about a group of unemployed Yorkshire steel workers who stage a strip show to make some needed cash.  We already know that.  What was so surprising to me was the very smart, sensitive, and totally hilarious way the film was made.  The actors are really good and quickly draw us into their individual dilemmas.  The film is heartwarming without being sappy.  As another reviewer wrote, ""Thank God Hollywood didn't make this movie!""  It could have been a cheezy disaster but this is handled so deftly that it deserves all the great response it has received.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this movie!

932034,5,6304813759,"I watched ""Full Monty"" directed by Peter Cattaneo first time when it was released ten years ago in 1997, became a surprising hit, and was nominated for several Academy awards. The movie instantly became one of my favorites. I don't know how close to the realities of British life it is/was but ""Full Monty"" is irresistible, and it features the songs of Donna Summer and Tom Jones that fit adorably to the story. I saw it again few days ago and it has not lost any of its original charm.  It is funny but it is more in the realm of dramedy which is my favorite genre.

Few things I've noticed this time:

Nothing is more tiring than doing nothing. Men are really very sensitive and insecure creatures. They have to have respect for themselves and this is a great movie about how far the desperate men would go to regain it.

I think every boy would dream about having a father like Carlyle's Gaz - he is more like a buddy, not a father.

Did I mention that after seeing the movie first three times I bought a Donna Summer's CD?

And...

The finals scene is spectacular. Our heroes learned something during the two weeks they were preparing for the show. They learned how to like themselves the way they are and how to respect themselves and with that knowledge came something else: ""coordination, skill, timing, fitness, and grace"" and they were fabulous during their one and only performance.",1185926400,6,1392,4.544

The story of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield, England who decide to put on a male striptease show for one night to make some money is a simple premise that is beautifully realized because of the time the film takes to build our understanding of these men and their different plights and motivations.  We come to know and care for them as they come to care for each other. The comedy grows from the characters and their personalities and their different reactions and situations.  There is sympathy and sensitivity to their desperation: Gaz (Robert Carlyle), the ex-con hustler, desperate to keep a connection with his son; Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), the manager, desperate to hold onto his middle-class lifestyle; Dave (Mark Addy), chubby and insecure, desperate to hold onto his wife; and so on.  Expertly played by these actors, new to American audiences in 1997, but now familiar, the laughter evoked is wry and humane and, in the end, joyful.

The film carefully builds the story with expert comedic setups (the auditions and rehearsals, etc.) of everyday men trying to do something they are seemingly unequipped and ill-prepared to accomplish, with touches of pathos as we see the troubles and strains in their personal lives.  All this leads to the Big Night and a grand finale that is funny, heart-warming and beautifully filmed.  A terrific little film with a lot on its mind, beneath the humor.  Something to do with the dignity of work, of self-respect, and of the touching care one can find amidst people undergoing hard times.  A gem.",1104624000,86,1751,4.888513513513513

Gaz, the main character, saw a group of Chippendales dancers pass through town on a one-time show with great success.  Although his group lacks the looks and the moves, Gaz is not deterred.  His primary motivation for this enterprise is to come up with child support money so he can spend time with his son.
The human interest story is what makes you root for these characters.  There is strong language, a scene of attempted suicide, impotence, strong male sexuality, and a homosexual scene.  The working-class accents are unbearably hard to decipher for the first fifteen minutes, but you get used to it.
The music is fantastic.  This movie is so unique that I wish everyone would see it.",1086739200,3,1223,4.668224299065421

I've seen it perhaps a dozen times, and each time I not only have laughed at the same jokes, but have also noticed some nuance that I overlooked before.",1086739200,3,433,4.864864864864865
932207,5,6304813759,"Without re-hashing the plot, suffice to say that this is one of the more original and accomplished feel-good films you'll ever see.  The story focuses on a bunch of lovable unemployed lads in Sheffield, England, following the collapse of the local steel industry (the film opens with one of those ""Progress Is Today"" film-reels we all watched in elementary school and sets a perfect tone for the rest of the film).  Their rallying cry:  an all-male strip tease.  The set-up:  minimal dancing talent and a low beefcake factor.
Instead of a bunch of caricatures, ""TFM"" gives us a fully realized ensemble, even with some touching scenes from the women who inhabit the fringes of the film.  The dense accents give the flick a delightful authenticity , and the cast has some wonderful comic timing as well as the ability to pluck the heartstrings at the right moments.
""TFM"" builds from a great premise to one of the best closing scenes in recent years -- you'll either be on your feet cheering or on the floor laughing, and maybe both.
The DVD offers good sound and picture quality, but there is a notable lack of extras.  Still, better a good flick and no extras than a mediocre flick and a bunch of goodies.",1083196800,,1205,4.65566037735849
932208,5,6304813759,"What a fun way to use up an evening. It is not a deep movie, it will not give you insight into British politics or humanity itself, just lots of good laughs.
We watch as 6 unemployed Yorkshire bloks work up the courage and, dare I say, the talent, to go the Full Monty after the Chppendale Dancers swagger their goods through town. Seeing this as an easy way to fatten their wallets we go through the emotions of these every day guys trying to just make it in the world when they lose their jobs, their furniture and lives when the Steel Mill they work in closes.
It is great to watchthe relationships in this movie.  That between Mark Addy's character and his wife that he thinks is cheating on him, because he sees himself as to fat.  Addy and Robert Carlyle as friends is fun and funny. The greatest relationship to watch is between Carlyle and the kid who plays his son Nate. All this stripping hulabaloo started as a way for Carlyle (Gaz) to repay his back child support so he can continue to see his son whom he loves very much, though he may not always be the best role model. The kid is in on some of the casting calls and helps with the music. All the characters are a shear riot to watch.

The main character represents a type we are all familiar with, a man who believes that charm alone will bring him all he wants and needs...until his ex-wife puts his back to the wall with a threat to withdraw access to his young son unless he starts paying court ordered child support.
This slick slacker is someone you'd be hard pressed to find sympathy for until you understand the very deep love for his son battling the Peter Pan immaturity of his nature.
What a wonderful light bulb clicking moment when he finds his ex accompanied by his luckless pal's wife at a Chippendale type entertainment.
Believing his own talents equal to the money making muscle bound strippers, he sets off on a journey of self-discovery dragging his skeptical but loyal young son along.
As he ensnares one after another of the down-on-their-luck former employees of the defunct factory into his get rich by getting naked scheme, each unknowingly becomes the kind of man he didn't believe possible.

932293,4,6304813759,"This movie was surprisingly funny!  I originally thought that this one wouldn't be good just on the basis of it's plot but in the end, this movie delivers a lot of laughs and for the ladies, some great male stripping that's really funny.
It starts out with 2 friends, Gazzer and Dave.  Both are recently laid off steel mill workers and are looking for work.  After they get turned away from their favorite bar because of an all ladies Chippendale performance, Gazzer gets a great idea, ""what if we were strippers?  We'd make a lot of money"".  Just one problem, there's only 2 of them and they can't dance.  After holding some open tryouts, they find some other guys they used to work with that want to do this as well, including their former foreman that's also unemployed.  While working on their routine, Gazzer realizes that they have to do something special, they have to do THE FULL MONTY (be completely naked).  Now it's a question of who's still in it.
O.k. even though I'm a guy, I still laughed at this one because it's still pretty funny.  The guys are really funny, the music and soundtrack is great (a lot of great hits from the 70's) and just because the guys are the most unlikely strippers is pretty funny.  That and this movie took a lighthearted look on some very serious topics like suicide, divorce, homosexuality, unemployment and even the difficulty of being overweight.  You'd be surprised, but this movie might hit somewhere with some people.
Ladies will definitely get a kick out of this one and even the guys can take a laugh out of this.  And for any of you guys plotting to do your own type of Chippendales thing, here's an instructional video for you = )  In any case, this is an enjoyable movie.  And who could forget the ""fun with Garden Gnomes"" scene?  That scene alone is hilarious.  Anyway, check out THE FULL MONTY and if you're looking for another good International movie, check out WAKING NED DEVINE, CHOCOLAT and this is a good one from Japan, TAMPOPO.

Trust me; you will find no Dick Van Dykes or Helen Baxendale accents in this film. Coming from Wigan, in Northern England myself it gets SO annoying when all Brits in movie are so BLOODY POSH!

932295,5,6304813759,"Several out-of-work men in the decaying town of Sheffield, England envision a scheme to earn money and the adoration of a town full of women...and thus begins the delightful story of 'The Full Monty.'
I approached this movie with no expectations and found an incredibly funny and realistic look at hard times in a struggling town.  With jobs difficult to find and the town's women being lured to view the oiled bodies of Chippendale dancers, these friends take matters into their own hands in an attempt to reclaim the pride that was vanquished when they found themselves unemployed.  While their ultimate plan may be a strange way to take pride in themselves, these men pull it off quite humorously.
Aside from the general plot, this movie also gives us a glimpse of how families deal with hard times (including unemployment and divorce).  I found myself interested in not only the fantastic scheme of the men, but also in the dynamics of how these families would ultimately succeed.  All in all, I was quite impressed with the movie and enjoy watching it anytime I need a good laugh.

932296,5,6304813759,"This classic (albeit very modern) 1997 British film, which I have seen a few times now, is one of my favourites.  The storyline is highly original, very funny, and hugely entertaining overall, but it's also heartwarming.  The setting is Sheffield, England, world famous for its steel.  Sadly Sheffield, like most of the North of England, has had to deal with massive unemployment; in Sheffield's case, it's a result of the collapse of the steel industry.  Briefly, the story revolves around six unemployed men, victims of the times, who aspire to ""putting on"" a one-night-only ""full monty"" (British slang for ""taking it ALL off"") strip show to raise some much-needed cash.
The idea is actually the brain-child of one of the men, Gaz (played by Robert Carlyle (The World is Not Enough)), who is in arrears in his maintenance payments for his son (who lives with Gaz's ex-wife and her new boyfriend).  Gaz is at risk of losing joint custody and fears he may lose his son altogether.  His motivation (and indeed his desperation) in coming up with such an outrageous scheme is, therefore, both plausible and understandable, for the men stand to pocket a nice little sum of money if they can, quite literally, pull it off.  The film, which is 95 minutes, also features Tom Wilkinson (Essex Boys), who plays the lads' former boss from the steel factory, and Paul Barber (Denzil from Only Fools and Horses).
In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to fans of British comedy in general, but I think its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a thoroughly enjoyable comedy with a really good storyline.  Just one thing: Viewers ought to be prepared for fairly thick Yorkshire accents.  This may be a bit of a shock at first for the unfamiliar, but close attention helps and it is well worth the effort.  It's a cute story that is superbly acted and very well presented.  What's more, it's a film that can be enjoyed time and again.
Very highly recommended!",1034899200,23,1971,4.767647058823529
932297,5,6304813759,"This film has some moments of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry; but it also has moments that will cause some reflection.  And in the end, it's actually somewhat gentle fare, considering the subject matter, which on the surface may seem won't to lend itself to a much coarser interpretation.  Rest assured, however, ""The Full Monty,"" directed by Peter Cattaneo, is a fun-filled excursion that skirts some serious issues while warmly embracing the more humorous aspects of the human condition.  It's a telling study of desperation without the misery, of loss without the moroseness, and finally it's an upbeat, uplifting tale of pursuing possibilities, and what it means to reach for the rainbow in the wake of the storm.
The film opens with a clip that could've been prepared by any local chamber of commerce, touting the city of Sheffield, England, as a growing concern in the industrial market, a veritable city on the move.  The story then quickly jumps ahead twenty-five years, and we find that the once booming steel business has been quieted, the mill closed down indefinitely.  Which means, of course, that many able bodied workers are out of a job, and their prospects for the future are less than bleak.  Among those forced to go on the dole are Gaz Schofield (Robert Carlyle) and his friend, Dave (Mark Addy), whose lives become especially complicated by their current status of ""unemployed.""  Unable to make child support payments, Gaz is about to lose visitation rights with his son, Nathan (William Snape), and losing his job has left Dave emasculated, leading to problems with his wife, Jean (Lesley Sharp).
Then one night the ""Chippendales"" show arrives in town, and for the ""ladies only"" performance, the local venue is sold out, at ten quid a head.  And after having a quick peek at the dancers for himself, inspiration suddenly strikes Gaz, who figures if a bunch of ""puffers"" like the Chippendales can cause such a stir, why not some local talent?  Like himself, Dave, and whoever else he can get to jump on the bandwagon with him.  The kicker is, Gaz knows that they're going to have to go the Chippendales one up; and that means going ""The Full Monty.""  If they're going to pack `em in, they're going to have to go all the way...
Peter Cattaneo is to be commended for handling so sensitive a subject and the accompanying issues with such warmth and humor.  Let's face it, a story about a bunch of guys who resort to ""stripping"" in order to survive could have gone in an entirely different direction.  But thanks to the insights of Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, the result is a film that reaches out and touches the humanity in us all.  The characters are all richly drawn and delivered by Cattaneo through his actors with great care.  These are very real people with whom anyone past the age of majority will be able to identify, in one way or another.  And that's what really sells the film.  Cattaneo keeps it all very real and down-to-earth, sets an effective pace and backs it all up with a terrific soundtrack of contemporary music.  Who will be able to come away from this film NOT at least humming Hot Chocolate's ""You Sexy Thing,"" or thinking about the scene in which ""Horse"" (Paul Barber) ""auditions"" to Wilson Pickett's ""Land of 1000 Dances?""  Or when the guys, after having rehearsed for awhile, are on line at the employment office when Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" comes on and they can't keep still.  Cattaneo takes a positive approach to negative issues, wraps it all up in humility, humanity and hard work, and in doing so he gives his audience a film that is highly entertaining, emotionally involving and unforgettable.
Heading up the ensemble cast, Robert Carlyle is right on with his portrayal of Gaz.  He completely captures the blue collar, working class image and attitude that defines his character so succinctly.  And he convincingly conveys the fact that he doesn't know one ""beat"" from another, as evidenced by the way he is ""always ahead"" of the rest, regardless of which piece of music they're dancing to.
Mark Addy captures the essence of who these guys are, as well, giving a memorable performance as Dave.  His is an extremely sensitive portrayal of of a man dealing with some very personal problems, which he addresses through his character quite believably.  And, in Dave's case, especially, Addy manages to elicit empathy without making him unduly sympathetic, which affords him, as well as the others and the film, the ability to maintain a semblance of dignity in the face of adversity, which is essentially one of the main tenets of the story.
Also turning in an effective performance is Tom Wilkinson as Gerald, the former foreman of the steel mill, now reduced to being just one of the guys, and on the dole along with the rest of them.  Wilkinson brings to light the fact that Gerald's issues are somewhat different from the rest initially, but he gradually develops his character to the extent that you finally understand that Gerald is not so different from Gaz or Dave or the others after all.  And it's Wilkinson's insightful portrayal that more than any of the others cements that sense of community which is, in the end, the great equalizer of the species.
The supporting cast includes Steve Huison (Lomper), Hugo Speer (Guy), Emily Woof (Mandy), Deirdre Costello (Linda), Paul Butterworth (Barry), Dave Hill (Alan) and Bruce Jones (Reg).  In reality, losing one's means of survival can be a devastating experience.  And what Cattaneo has done with ""The Full Monty"" is establish a sense of hope for those who may find themselves one day in the ""outbox"" of life, and he's done it with style, class and that most necessary of all of life's ingredients, humor.  This is a film to embrace-- and to enjoy over and over again.",1030924800,3,5811,4.800401203610832
932298,5,6304813759,"I brought ""The Full Monty"" home one evening when my boyfriend was not feeling well because I thought that a good laugh would cheer him up. His reaction to seeing the video box? ""I'm already not feeling well. I don't want to watch a movie about a bunch of male strippers prancing around."" And then we put in the movie and couldn't stop laughing.
""The Full Monty"" is about so much more than male strippers. The film centers around out-of-work steelworkers trying to cope with life now that their mill is shut down. The movie realistically explores male friendship, men's feelings about failing their wives' expectations, devotion to family, coping with loss,... but in ways that do not become depressing.
The stripper plan comes about because Gaz (Robert Carlyle) needs to come up with money to bring his child support current so that he can continue seeing his son. The father-son relationship is one of the most touching aspects of the movie.  Gaz's son, Nate, tags along with Gaz as he tries to put together a Chippendale-style show to catch up on his child support.  [As an aside, ""The Full Monty"" and ""A Thousand Clowns"" with Jason Robards would be an interesting pair of movies to see together as a starting point for examining what makes a good father.]
The relationships between the dancers that Mark Addy and Carlyle assemble is fun to watch. Tom Wilkison (also seen in ""The Patriot"", ""In the Bedroom"", and ""Moulin Rouge"") is excellent as their former supervisor who turns to dancing to cover his wife's extravagant spending. Addy is equally good as Gaz's chubby friend who is struggling with his marriage: His wife wants him to take a job in a local variety store. He thinks she's having an affair because he's too fat.

932299,5,6304813759,"I had a hard time convincing a friend of mine, one of the biggest film buffs of all time, to watch this movie. Being a red-blooded American male he said he had no desire to ""see a bunch of men stripping."" This is so far from the core and truth of this movie. To me, the Full Monty is about regaining pride and dignity and a sense of self when one has been robbed of one's livelihood. The movie would be even more timely today, in the wake of the felling of corporate giants and the transplanting of manufacturing to other countries. It shows the pervasive nature of unemployment; how it wrecks one's relationships and takes a toll on one's energy and psyche. It answers questions close to all men's hearts: Is a man a man without a job? Can a man separate his working self from his romantic and other selves? If one has been a boss, a leader, are those qualities still there when one is no longer in charge? When the beauracratic labels have been stripped away, can the men be friends?
Lest I make this sound too serious, take it from me that this movie strikes a very loving and warmhearted, goofy tone, and as everyone says, the sound track propels the viewer into a state of euphoria that lasts throughout the movie. I thought when I first saw it that I'd remember it only as that year's sleeper, but years later it remains one of my favorite movies. See it and enjoy it.

The premise seems silly but it works because the actors are so believable. Average guys who are out of work and needing money for a variety of reasons - child support, self-esteem, lifestyle, etc. They see women spending money to see a Chippendales show and  decide that they could make the money they need by doing their own show and offering ""the full monty"". The rehearsals are great as are each man's struggles with the idea and reality of what they are facing.
I've recommended this film to several friends, all of whom loved it as much as I do. If you like to cheer for the underdog you should enjoy the movie as that's what it's all about.

932301,4,6304813759,"The Full Monty is a ""right good laff"" (to borrow the parlance of its protagonists). Although the dialect may occasionally bewilder viewers unused to north-England speech, the humour doesn't need any translation. Gaz is down on his luck and is possessed of an endless supply of far-fetched money-making schemes. Inspired with a visit by the renowned Chippendale male strip-show artists to his hometown of Sheffield, and impressed at the huge amounts of money they make by seemingly just taking off their clothes and prancing around a bit, Gaz decides this is his ticket to some fast cash.
Part of the reason this film is likeable is that humour and realism go hand in hand. From the depressing backdrop of an industrial town with high unemployment, Gaz manages to cobble together a troupe of six unlikely strippers, including a suicidal security worker, a man with a dodgy hip, and a well-endowed bathroom repairman. These guys aren't super-studs, they're just ordinary blokes who are willing to give it a shot, and maybe, just maybe, get rich.
The film begins with Gaz and his friend Dave becoming marooned on a partially submerged car in the middle of a canal (the unanticipated result of one Gaz's plans), and the originality of the comedy continues throughout. So fresh is the humour, that the occasional moments when it sinks to the level of slapstick and cliche, disrupt the natural feel of the movie. The funniest sequences involve the self-titled 'Hot Metal' strippers - who have trouble comprehending dance moves unless they're related to positioning on a soccer field - attempting to master the strip-tease bump and grind (accompanied by a fabulous soundtrack of retro tunes, including Donna Summer and Hot Chocolate).",1025136000,2,1727,5.063157894736842

When his ex-wife seeks full custody, he must find a way to start raising his support money.  He gathers his mates and devises a scheme where they would put on a stripper show.  Hilarity ensues.
Robert Carlyle is great in this movie, not nearly as severe and evil as his role as Begby in ""Trainspotting.""  He demonstrates a softer side that allows the audience to root for him.  Mark Addy and Tom Wilkinson give strong performances as friends Dave and Gerald, respectively.  Dave struggles with his weight and his marriage while Gerald hopes to find a job quickly to pay his wife's credit card bills.  These are real life situations these men face.  It's all believable and human.
It's no wonder this film was among the five that year nominated for Best Picture.  Curses to ""Titanic"" for being such a big deal!

Three years later, ""The Full Monty"" has become one of my treasured favorites, a guaranteed feel-good experience even after multiple (too many to count) viewings.
Everybody knows the plot by now--down-and-out laid-off Yorkshire blue-collar workers who turn to strip-dancing to make a quick buck. It's not the plot that's so wonderful, although it certainly is a wonderful premise, but the sheer exuberant charm of the movie itself. Much like ""A Hard Day's Night"" was in ths 60s, this is just a bunch of silliness that works.

932397,4,6304813759,"Funny, feel-good comedy about 6 guys who are unemployed and complain about their state of affairs. They agree to do a strip show for a few bucks, but with one slight twist--they'll take EVERYTHING off! Robert Carlyle (who was downright scary as Begbie in ""Trainspotting"") has never been funnier and so at ease onscreen, and the other supporting cast memebers (including Tom Wilkinson) are also good. A great movie about following your dreams, physical appearance, and beating the odds. So why the mere 4-star rating? Because there are virtually no features on this disc (just a trailer), plus the sound is not 5.1 surround but 2.0 stereo. It sounds good for what it is, but I would have like to have gotten a better audio presentation. But these are small gripes: ""The Full Monty"" was one of the better movies of 1997 and warrants your attention.",1011657600,,846,4.801369863013699
932398,5,6304813759,"Seriously, despite the subject matter. This movie of out-of-work Brits who turn to stripping to make a buck is one of the funniest movies of all time, and it holds up well under multiple viewings.

932399,5,6304813759,"The Full Monty was a delightful film.  I first watched it with friends after a holiday dinner and decided to get it and share it with my husband who also found it enjoyable.  The characters are well rounded, and the details of their lives and personal tribulations make them thoroughly engaging.
What I found most endearing was the development of closeness among the men whose fiscal disasters had brought them together in the first place.  No matter how outrageous the concept of the average guy getting naked in a Chippendales' style review, the spirit and courage of the men were wonderful to see.  So too was the gradual regrowth of their sense of personal worth as they worked out their routine together.  The scene in the unemployment queue with the men unconsciously going through their routine to background music was wonderful.",1001894400,,836,4.900709219858156

But finally, after two years, I worked up the nerve to rent it, and was I surprised.  I found myself sitting in my living room HOWLING with laughter!  These Chippendales wannabes are far from perfect, and they know it.  I think that's what makes it all so outrageously funny.  Having seen the movie once, I only wish the strip scenes had been longer!
The dialog wasn't very hard to follow, despite the thick accents.  I was kept laughing throughout.  I'll be watching this one again!",997488000,3,645,4.361344537815126
932523,5,6304813759,"A winning, inspired comedy that is refreshingly unique in itself. Robert Carlyle heads the cast in a film centering on the lives of a group of unemployed men in Sheffield who decide to become a strip act. There are fine moments of high comedy throughout. The superb performance compliments the razor sharp script that also bubbles with inventive repartee. The film is accompanied by an enthralling soundtrack that builds up the atmosphere for this fun comedy. Despite its gritty undertone this does surprisingly emerge as a feel-good film. The scene when the men are pumping and gyrating to the songs on the radio whilst waiting in the dole queue is unforgetable and inspired comedy. An excellent classic!",992044800,2,705,5.034188034188034

Really, this is a great movie.",985737600,,346,4.34375
932525,5,6304813759,"In my opinion, 'The Full Monty' should have won 1997's Oscar for Best Picture. However, given that it was up against 'Titanic', you'll know how  unrealistic that hope was. 'The Full Monty' is billed as a comedy, but it  has a lot more to offer. The characterizations are particularly strong, and  the story that is told is actually pretty complex. It offers comments on  the collapse of old industries, and the quiet desperation of the workers  that are left behind. People living in America's rust belt or Canada's  Maritimes should be able to sympathize very strongly with these poor men  from northern England, struggling just to make a living.
This is a story  about humiliation, and more than just the humiliation of taking off one's  clothes in public. Every character goes through a more personal humiliation  through this story, and actually emerges stronger as a result. That's what  makes this tale so uplifting. You care for these characters as real people.  And in the end, they've extracted one small victory for themselves -- and  for us.",967420800,4,1052,4.909090909090909
932526,5,6304813759,"That this movie was such a massive hit at the box office shouldn't surprise anyone who has seen it.  Made on a shoestring budget, shot in some  dismal locations, and with the actors and crew probably only being paid the  minimum wage, this movie has the heart, the energy, and the emotion that  highly overbudgeted and overrated Hollywood blockbusters lack.  When the  lead character, Gaz, (played to droll perfection by Robert Carlyle) is  faced with losing rights to his son because his child support is in  arrears, he comes up with an easy way to earn the money and have a bit left  over - by recruiting his best friend, their ex-boss, and 3 others to join  him in a ""Chippendales"" act, where for one night only, they will  go ""The Full Monty.""  (Hence the title).  But as it turns out,  they will not just be ripping their duds off for money - along the way they  will learn about friendship, caring, togetherness, and self respect,  without which no human being can survive.  Alternately side splittingly  funny and deeply touching, this is a film which can be enjoyed by those who  like a dose of humour and sensitivity kneaded into the same dough.",965692800,8,1155,4.600985221674877

The first time I watched Full Monty, I almost didn't finish because it's a little slow-moving at first. I'm also not used to watching  foreign-made films either. But I decided to stick with it, & boy am I  glad I did! It does eventually pick up, & you too will be glad you  stuck with it. Without giving away all the details of the movie, I just  want to say that I've watched this a couple of times already, & know I  will be watching it a few more times in the future. I have also purchased  this one for my DVD collection--a MUST have for your comedy section. This  was excellent, light-hearted entertainment, & I highly recommend for a  few good laughs on a rainy day: LOVED IT!",959990400,6,764,4.142857142857143
932528,5,6304813759,"This movie was wonderful!  Granted, I couldn't understand all of the Northern England slang during the first viewing, but I saw the chemistry and laughed like crazy.  Once you watch it a few more times, if you're an  American I guess, you can dig deeper and start understanding some of the  other wry lines and laugh all over again. I can't see how someone wouldn't  like this marvelous flick!  Those Brits sure know how to make me laugh!  :)
P.S.  I didn't find much difference between the  ""Americanized"" vs. ""British Release"" on the DVD, so if  that's your only reason for getting the DVD, skip it.  However, I think the  sound and picture quality on the DVD is excellent!  The cool music sounds  pretty good on DVD with a surround sound system!",959904000,3,748,4.568181818181818
932529,5,6304813759,"The basic story of this film is very simple, a group of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield in England decide to try to raise money by performing for one night only as male strippers.
Beyond that, there is so much  more.
First of all, the film is very very funny. The sight of a group of  men of dubious attraction and in varying stages of unfitness trying to  become a dancing & stripping troupe is just the start. Side stories  like the theft of garden gnomes and the act of offering to fix a man's car  so that he can gas himself are classic examples of off-beat British  humour.
There is also a lot of warm human interest in this film. We see  the relationship between Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and his son and his ex-wife.  Also, the relationships between his friends and their wives.
In all  cases, the men had lost self respect and, through the act of former  workmates getting together again and making new work for themselves they  recaptured their self respect, regain the respect of others and most  importantly to them, they realise that they are important to their friends  and families.
Often films with such a lot of fun and feel good factor  leave me feeling that they are too sickly sweet and aim at some lowest  common denominator. This was not like that at all, I enjoyed every minute  of it.
I first saw this at the cinema and I have never before seen such a  happy audience at the end of a film.",958003200,8,1413,4.3938223938223935

932532,4,6304813759,"A cheesy sixties tourist film runs over the credits, and we get a peek at Sheffield's heyday as a British industrial super-city on the grow. Contrast that with the low-wage or no-job watseland of Sheffield in the 90's, and  the desperatation is easy to understand.
One of the men, played by  Robert Carlye, is about to lose visiting rights with his son if he can't  earn the 700 pounds to help support the boy.  After dropping in on a  Chippnedales review, dad and a pudgy pal figure it might just work for  them.  Now keep in mind, these guys are no studs.  They're from the  eat-now, weigh-later school of thought.  But despite their physical  shortcomings, they've got drive.
You've got to like a movie where  characters, fully aware of the embarrassing possibilities, embark on a  no-holes-barred adventure to reclaim their last shred of dignity. The Full  Monty, which is a Brit-speak term for taking at all off, squeezes a lot out  of a little, and at times the mens' aimlessness makes for slow going.  But  in scenes where they practice their stage moves or wait in an dole line  unable to control their happy feet, the movie is supremely silly--a romp  that's inconsequential but never less than fun.",950400000,5,1208,4.721153846153846

It is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. How wonderful that someone set out to tell a story, and ended up entertaining us all to the extent that this film did. There are almost too many standout scenes to mention, but let me try a few. The scene on the street where Gaz is trying to get Nathan back in the car, and says ""I love ya, ya bugger"". The look on Lomper's face when the other band members start playing the stripper theme music. Gaz's first attempt at stripping in the headlights of the car, with change flying out of his coat pockets, trying to get his t-shirt off with his cigarette still in his mouth. It's such a great movie on so many levels. You never forget that these men are living through a real-life nightmare that many of us have experienced ourselves. You feel their desperation, their emasculation, their insecurities, their panic, as if it were happening to you. But because these people seem so real to you, you'll also feel their triumphs. I didn't have as much trouble as I expected to with the accents, but the second time around was definitely clearer. The actual strip show scene is priceless, pay close attention to the looks on the guys faces. They had a great time making this movie, I bet. One final thought, watch for the scene on the hill with Gaz, Dave, and Lomper. It's too sweet to be real.",935193600,3,1507,4.309859154929577
