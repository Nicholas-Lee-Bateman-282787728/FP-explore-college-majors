2062723,2,B000255LGG,"I'm into action and adventure, the more going on the better.  I found this a tad dull, I enjoyed the cast of characters, and even the story plot. But it was slow for my taste.  However, it works for a rainy afternoon's entertainment.  A bit of violence and language is about as risque as it gets.",1093478400,4,296,4.25
2062724,1,B000255LGG,"THE VECTOR FILE offers us Casper van Dien (Starship Troopers, Python) as a geologist in New Zealand, recently separated from his wife (Catherine Oxenberg), and a good father to his daughter (India Oxenberg).  Now, van Dien does better than one would expect but his performance cannot save this muddled, dull and illogical ""thriller.""

The only convincing thing is the lush and beautiful New Zealand scenery.

The film opens with a Russian somebody chewing his nails in front of his computer.  He obviously is doing something he shouldn't.  Voila!  Three nasty agents (including one British accented lovely) bust in and tell him to stop his computer.  He is sending an e-mail file to someone.  He refuses and he is of course killed.

Flash to van Dien in New Zealand, a geologist who works at a place that also has a satellite dish which communicates with the several satellites in outer space.  He takes his daughter to work and while she is doing horse pictures on the PC, the e-mail that the Russian sent is downloaded.  The little girl is perplexed because she wants to print a copy of her horsie picture, but instead she prints out the 60+ page e-mail and when her dad comes in she stuffs it into her schoolbag, afraid he might spank her or something.  Now, why was this e-mail sent to a geologist in New Zealand?

Pretty soon, the nasty agents appear in New Zealand and want that e-mail.  We find out later the e-mail is a DNA code that mimics small pox, and could be sold to hostile nations for global biological warfare.  Or something like that.

From then on out, the nasties set up van Dien by killing a security guard and then they for some inexplicable reason turn on the female lovely, kill her and frame van Dien again.

Van Dien grunts runs and fights like any good geologist would, and the movie careens to its utterly predictable ending.

The screenwriters have offered little explanation for van Dien's involvement, and when they try, they fail miserably.  We never now who the girl agent was supposed to be.

Both Oxenbergs share the lack of any real acting talent and the pace is sluggish and soporific.

Not a good movie at all--even for Casper's friends.",1092700800,10,2175,4.671052631578948

2062791,1,B000255LGG,"This is really a poor movie all the way around. The storyline and script seemed like it was written by a grade schooler. The synopsis states '....accidentally prints out a DNA code that in the wrong hands can end the human race'. Nowhere is this stated in the movie, never mind expanded upon, you really don't know why the 'bad guys' are even after it. Bad script, bad acting, circumstances and events that just aren't believable - an example: 'hero' is driving to save daughter, stops for gas, gas station attendant - an old fat guy recognizes the hero on TV as being wanted by the police, hero goes to get in his car and leave - but the attendant has the keys and sticks tongue out at the hero. Instead of grabbing the keys, clocking the attendant, and ripping out the phone, this guy takes off running toward a destination we are led to believe is still miles away - while the gas station attendant calmly calls the police. This scene is actually worse when you watch it. Don't be drawn into the 'X-File' like cover art, that really is where any similarity ends.

2062800,4,B000255LGG,"Don't get me wrong this movie isn't cinematic genius and by no means the most original movie I ever saw but it is a good direct to video.  No big spoilers but the plot of the movie centers on the Vector File which is basically a long complicated computer file that could be used to make a biological WMD.  Casper Van Dien is the protagonist of the movie and his daughter downloads the Vector File.  He is watching his daughter because he and his wife are estranged and his wife had other things to do than watch her kid.  Even though it was her time to have shared custody.  That's how come he's has his daughter at work and how the events of the movie begins.

The antagonists are Russians, I think they're criminals rather than government agents.  They figure out when and where the file was downloaded and cause even more problems for Casper Van Dien by making him seem crazy and making him a suspect in a murder.  Because that's what they do.

I won't give further details of the movies because the story is pretty straight forward.  This movie is free with Amazon Prime so it is worth the cost if this is your type of movie.",1429747200,,1129,4.333333333333333

For some reason (explained at the end) Gerry Anderson (Casper) is sent a secret DNA code by Russians who dress in black/navy blue and walk to heavy bass music. However Gerry didn't get them. Instead his daughter got them by accidentally printing out a ream of printer paper in an effort to print out a drawing she did on a computer of a horse (dad kids her and calls it a giraffe). She hides the paper in her school bag unbeknown to Dad. He has her for the weekend while his wife (MILF Oxenberg) is ...? I'm not sure. The Russians show up and trash his place and try to get him, but he gets away. When the cops show up there is no sign of anyone being there, including the dead body. The movie steals bad lines from other movies in an attempt to be cute such as ""Woman: Can't live with them. Can't shoot them.""

Even the seduction scene was lame. No sex. No nudity. They could have at least teased us by having the woman run the shower and showing her drop a towel on the floor. If your going to steal from other films, take something good. The action was slow paced and not very exciting even during the action scenes. The movie suffered from a bad script.

2062812,4,B000255LGG,"I won't go into detail about the synopsis of this movie as you are probably famailiar with it or you can read other reviews of the movie.

This is a New Zealand/German Movie and lacks the big budget Hollywood puts out.  Still, the movie kept my interest from beginning to end.  The movie may seem slow to some: however, I thought it moved at a decent pace throughout.  Guess not every movie can be the speed of the movie  ""2012"".  The acting is decent and for the most part believable.  It does have a few plot holes (probably due to the characters not being more developed).  Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg were married at the time of this film and Catherine was five months pregnant with Maya Van Dien during filming.

Lions Gate has a decent transfer of this to DVD; however, there are no special features except for Play Movie and Scene Selection.",1360972800,,859,4.490322580645161

Unfortunately for his friends, family, and even a female from the Russian Undercover Police, the Russian mafia will kill anyone that may interfere with their pursuit of this biological weapon.
