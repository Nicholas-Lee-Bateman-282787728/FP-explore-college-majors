8060873,5,B0009HLCM4,"The Walking Nightmare is the best of these two as for picture and sound. The movie itself is a good collection. I see a lot of post

8060874,3,B0009HLCM4,"If you know Monogram than you know A WALKING NIGHTMARE because it's the same movie as their THE LIVING GHOST. Which is not to say it's bad, but just be aware. The Alpha print of this one is pretty good but the other THE GHOST WALKS is really really bad, it looks like a third generation of a faded, splice-ridden print. That's the one I really wanted to see and I stopped watching after five minutes. And that says a lot since I grew up on third generation dupes of faded, splice-ridden prints of MOnogram horrors....",1349481600,2,517,4.395833333333333

SYNOPSES--

THE GHOST WALKS--  A stormy night and a car that skids off a remote road force a playwright and his secretary to take refuge in a creepy mansion. Dinner guests invited on the first anniversary of the homeowner's violent death discuss his murder. Then, the lights go out.....

A WALKING NIGHTMARE--  This was the working title of a film ultimately released as ""The Living Ghost."" An investigator finds that the wealthy kidnap victim he's been searching for has been turned into a sort of zombie.
