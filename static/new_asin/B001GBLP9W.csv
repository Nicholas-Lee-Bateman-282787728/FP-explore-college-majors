8304786,5,B001GBLP9W,"Received: a new VHS of an older (1972) ""Vietnam Veterans Against the War"" film.  The Vietnam War still affects the USA, including the Vets, all these years later, which makes this an important documentary.  It was not an easy era-chaos, anger, and yes, sometimes hope.  Unfortunately it is not on DVD, but this film is worth watching, then reflecting upon, with our 20/20 hindsight.  Remember and respect our Vietnam Vets.  Recommended.",1445817600,,436,5.084507042253521
8304787,5,B001GBLP9W,I first watched this film only one week ago. It is the most informative documentary I have ever seen about the war in vietnam. I am much to young to have experienced the sixties however this film brings me ever closer the finding out what went on in america during that crucial period in history.,1138665600,24,296,4.4
