8097383,5,B000CCKNT4,"This is a classic Australian kid's movie from the 1950s.  It depicts a freedom unknown to children today, in a bucolic setting that reminds us of a simpler, more integrated ""time gone by"", which I suspect was rater ""old"", even for the time in which it was made.  It's lack of political correctness is refreshing.  This is a fun indulgence and essential viewing for anyone with an interest in vintage Australian films or movies made for children.  The DVD I received is region 4, so will only play in region-free DVD players or those set on region 4.",1360886400,,549,4.571428571428571
