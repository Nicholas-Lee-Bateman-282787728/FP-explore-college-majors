708646,4,6303801919,"HARRISON BERGERON (1995)
directed by Bruce Pittman
approximately 1 hour 39 minutes

In the future there isn't any envy or hate.  There is no competition, so people don't feel bad when they don't do as well as their peers.  In fact they don't feel anything at all because their thought patterns are regulated by an electrical band that must be worn at all times.  There are very strict rules about what can be shown on television since people may have different reactions to the same show.  Therefore the official culture of the day is aimed at the lowest common denominator.  Sitcoms are bland and unoriginal and sports players are deliberately handicapped so as to skew the results into something close to a tie finish.

One young man born into this world can't seem to get it.  He likes learning and wants to do better for himself.  He is on his way to marry a pretty girl but laments the fact that they have nothing to talk about.  He does well in school in spite of his teachers who encourage him to get a special surgery that should take care of his intelligence ""problem"".  The doctor who is to perform the surgery recommends that since Harrison will only have his special brain for one last night, that he should check out a ""head house"".  These are places where people meet illegally to challenge themselves and learn for the sake of learning.  Our protagonist checks into a local head house and is impressed with this intellectual underworld.  This marks a major turning point in his life.  It turns out that Harrison has been monitored all his life by a group of elite bureaucrats - the same group who help to craft the mediocre culture that Harrison cannot relate to.

Harrison is recruited into this group because of his brilliant mind.  He takes a job in television, thinking it doesn't have to be the uninteresting schlock that it has become.  Best of all, he has access to real culture - Orson Welles radio plays, 'Its a Wonderful Life', Mozart - things all banned to the general population.  These are the kinds of things that fascinate Harrison, but they could inflame a civil disturbance amongst the citizenry.  When Harrison presents an idea for an exciting show to his supervisor, his proposal is swiftly rejected.  As he spends more time in the central planning process, he understands the secrets known only to the inner elite of the bureaucracy.  Even the president doesn't have a complete grasp of how the world works.  It becomes clear that the planners hold themselves to a a different set of standards than the rest of the population who doesn't even know that they exist.  Nevertheless Harrison sees their objective as a noble one.  After all, who wants to live in a society of turmoil and conflict?  Harrison must decide if he can reconcile the apparent benefits of the system with the double standards of the central planners.

This is a very good movie, especially since culture seems to be getting closer each year to the shows depicted in the movie.  It is of course based on the story by Kurt Vonnegut.  There is another Harrison Bergeron movie being made with the title '2081'.  I hope it is as enjoyable as this one!

I never thought that we'd get physical electric bands on our heads but that (mind numbing) TV would be promoted as an important part of a human's being, Ritalin is a valid cure, teaching towards self-esteem versus self-sufficiency would be promoted, and the news media using a certain slant would get people to not think too much on their own so that politicians would have an easier job of managing than to implement societal problems that may require ""political suicide"" meaning that the best solution would be the possibility of a one term.",1241308800,,708,4.656

708649,5,6303801919,"This production never received the recognition it deserves, perhaps because it is a mirror to politicians, leaders. and the movie industry.

Harrison Bergeron shows us a world in which we see social convention (currently called ""political correctness"") taken to its final extreme, where the Government shuts down the brains of smarter individuals in order to insure that no one feels bad about being below normal.  Everyone is reduced to average stupidity.

The film is very well done, with examples again and again of why such a ""solution"" is something no sane person would wish.

Perhaps Harrison Bergeron should be required viewing in high school government classes, to open students' minds as to the proper role of government.

At any rate, watch this movie for an experience that will broaden your mind, as you see smart young kids sneaking into what might be called ""intelligence brothels,"" where they go in to have free speech and the free exchange of ideas.  It's a memorable experience.",1162944000,4,995,5.07361963190184

Mediocrity and standardization are enforced on citizens by a totalitarian socialist government of well-meaning know-better elites (who are of course exempt from their own rules) until one young man rebels and threatens their order. In the vein of Orwell's ""1984"" or Animal Farm, this is a classic allegory for left-wing authoritarian hyprocrisy and supression of the individual's identity in favor of the ""group.""",1142812800,10,676,5.377358490566038
708651,5,6303801919,"This is a funny dark sci-fi comedy based on Kurt Vonnegut's short story, an anti-communist allegory exploring the ultimate result of a communist revolution in America. The new subjects are required to submit to various handicaps to make them all ""equal,"" including bands to stupify their brains, leg weights, etc. Of course it turns out it's all enforced by an elite class led by Christopher Plummer (The Sound Of Music, Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country).

As I recall the short story, it didn't go nearly as far as the movie, which is even more thought provoking and humorous. Sean Astin (""24,"" The Lord Of The Rings, Toy Soldiers) plays a citizen who's brain band doesn't seem to keep him dumb enough, so he's scheduled for surgery, which turns out to be a ploy to recruit him.

Astin's father, John Astin (The Addams Family), has a bit part; Eugene Levy (Cheaper By The Dozen 2, American Pie) is very funny as the ostensible President of the U.S.A.; his former SCTV co-star Andrea Martin also has a small part, as does Hayden Christensen (Anekin Skywalker of Star Wars).",1138492800,8,1078,4.759358288770054
708652,3,6303801919,"I haven't seen this film in ages, but I remember it being an impulse rent from a family member who has yet to live down this particular event.  Essentially, the family felt the movie was pretty bad, bad enough to be the top reason we don't let anyone impulse rent a movie they've never heard of for fear of witnessing a cataclysmicly bad movie.  I give it three stars because while watching I knew that it was a story that would make a great short story but was not something that could be properly transferred to film...and I was pleasently surprised to find out recently that it was indeed based on a short story as I felt lo those many years ago.  Now I must go hunt down the short story, because unlike the presentation in the movie, I found the idea behind it fascinating and very much look forward to seeing the idea portrayed in the medium it was meant to be in.

Go ahead and watch it; the story is interesting enough to make enduring the movie not such a horrible prospect.  And I suppose, judging from the other reviews, that familiarity with the story makes the viewing of this movie OK, even good.  Otherwise...well...there's a reason the family member never lived down renting it.",1106438400,,1193,4.474654377880184
708653,4,6303801919,"This film is a brilliant piece of satire in that it is not about the future, as it claims, or the past, which at first glance it appears. It is in reality a strikingly profound, although simple, parody of the present.  Or of human nature. When I finished watching this intellegent movie, I was disturbed.  But what troubles me is that I don't know whether it's disturbing because it's dark fantasy, or because it's the horrid truth and it's not a fictional story at all.  If you like dark, anti-establishment films like 1984 and A Clockwork Orange, you might like this, although it's a little lighter.",1092268800,9,601,4.650943396226415

708715,5,6303801919,"This movie held my attention all the way through.
This movie has many scenes which remind me of real life today, not just in the vague future.  The head bands and school scenes remind me of how many teachers sometimes don't let their students grow.  The head clubs remind me that if you want a challenge and to grow, you have to go out there and get it, sometimes overcoming obstacles along the way.  Then there is the strange philosophy of those in the innermost circle of the people running everyones' lives.  Some people really are more equal.  Then there is finding that special someone to share your life and interests.  The piano and sax scenes were very moving.  The ending is a bit hokey, and shows hopelessness, but then just a glimmer returns.",1078704000,6,753,4.574626865671642
708716,4,6303801919,"Bruce Pittman's intelligent and modest TV adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's short story is a wonderful and much underappreciated piece of high sci-fi. Films of this kind are rarely made, simply because there's not much potential audience for low-budget science fiction - most people are in sci-fi mainly for special effects and impressive battles. Harrison Bergeron, though, is one of those few adaptations made of real philosophical sci-fi, the kind that creates an image of the future as a reflection of our own reality. And it succeeds quite well in delivering its message, and for what it is it could be enjoyed by almost everyone - though I doubt it could have done well in the theaters.
The film revolves around two wonderful lead actors - one is Sean Astin, who recently gained success and fame as Sam Gamgee in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. The other is the wonderful British actor Christopher Plummer, remembered by sci-fi buffs as the Klingon General Chang from Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country. Brilliant comedian Eugene Levy gives an eerily funny performance as the President. The story is of a future America in which equality is achieved by discouraging exceptional talent or intelligence and creating forced mediocrity. Harrison (Sean Astin) is one of the exceptional few whose intelligence surfaces despite the government's best efforts and is therefore given the chance to work for the government. There he discovers the timeless Orwellian truth of Fascist regimes - all are equal, but some are more equal than others. Astin's interplay with Clummer (the classic `Big Brother') is wonderful, and the ending is beautiful. The script does an excellent job of expanding Vonnegut's very short story into a 100 minute film.
Harrison Bergeron is well worth watching - if you can get your hands on it. As far as I know there isn't a DVD available, but the VHS can be ordered on Amazon and the movie plays occasionally on television. If you're interested in science fiction literature of authors like Vonnegut, Philip K. Dick, or Isaac Asimov, this wonderful little think-piece is a good purchase.",1064793600,42,2120,5.042735042735043
708717,3,6303801919,"Kurt Vonnegut is an American icon and is perhaps best known for novel, ""Slaughter House Five,"" a novel of societal criticism. One of his better-celebrated pieces of writing is a short story of just a few pages called ""Harrison Bergeron."" This 1995 movie is a 99-minute adaptation of that brief short story. In a nut shell the story doesn't survive well as a film. At best, the poor quality of acting and ""made-for-television"" film made a good short story into a film that is mediocre at best. The ideas of the film and short story, of course, are very good, but this adaptation doesn't communicate Vonnegut's ideas very well.
--------------------------------------------------
FILM PLOT: The film's plot revolves around the question of human equality, happiness and how to achieve it. In a society of the future after a Second American Revolution, the United States has followed a course towards human equality by making everyone into the lowest common denominator. This dark future United States achieves this equality by a program of directed breeding (When breeding for superior qualities, it's called eugenics, maybe it's called ""malgenics"" or ""dysgenics"" when purposely breeding for less capable characteristics?) and where directed breeding doesn't work, citizens where special mind control collars that handicap their intelligences to a point where everyone has about the same level of brain power. In this dark future, students are encouraged to be average and seek ""C"" grades. Predictably, Harrison Bergeron has such a high IQ that his mind control collar cannot effectively inhibit his intelligence and he must make a choice between a surgery similar to a lobotomy or disappear from society.
ACTING: Despite having an all-star cast of comedians such as Buck Henry, Howie Mandell, Andrea Martin, and Eugene Levy, the film isn't very funny. At best it's a dark comedy. The film's regular cast of Sean Astin (Rudy), Christopher Plummer (Wolf), Miranda de Pencier (Sea of Love) is good, but overall put forward an uninspiring performance.
Without a doubt, the best scene of the film is Eugene Levy's portrayal of a dimwitted president of the future and I don't say president elect because in the film, presidents are chosen randomly from among the people. Levy as a foul-mouthed former steel worker turned president faces a crisis of a threatening foreign power acquiring WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction). He, in a very simple and humorous manner, tells the foreign power using plenty of curse words, as all steel workers do of course, that if they don't destroy their WMDs that he will nuke them and then gives them a 5-minute deadline... The scene's resolution is incredibly funny.
FILM QUALITY: The actual quality of the film is good, but the film was shot in such a manner that it appears to be a ""made-for-television"" movie. The cast of many B-grade actors reinforces this idea. Parts of the film appear to have been edited to be able to fit in commercial breaks.
STYLE: For all that the film suffered from a mediocre adaptation of a short story to a film, the style of the film was outstanding. The regular ""equal"" people of the film all appear to be trapped in the conformity of the 1950s, houses, clothing, school, etc. Special effects in the film were also very well done. The mind control collars (actually headbands) looked like real science fiction artifacts although they made the actors of the film look like they're wearing orthodontic appliances.
AUTHENTICITY: The short story and this film are two very different beasts. In the short story, Harrison Bergeron is giant, something that Sean Astin could never portray. While the film features Miranda de Pencier as a love interest for Astin / Bergeron, the short story features no such character. The film adds numerous such details that the short story does not. Apparently, Kurt Vonnegut participated in the making of the film, but that's hard to believe since the film seems so little like Vonnegut's ideas and writing. Maybe Vonnegut needed a little money?
COMMENTS: Kurt Vonnegut is ultimately about counterculture as are many writers who matured (or didn't) in the 1960s. The world then was in a very precarious state of change with the Vietnam War, presidents being assassinated, the race to space, and so many other unsettling events. Many of the writers of the period have very cynical view of life and Vonnegut is no exception. I find him very pessimistic and prefer much lighter fare or a more optimistic view of societal problems than Vonnegut forwards.

I mildly recommend this movie at best and suggest the following films and novels that discuss similar themes (and do a better job of it!) instead:

708718,5,6303801919,"All apologies to Kurt Vonnegut fans, I never liked him. Read 4 or 5 of his books and found him only annoying. Never read the story this film was based on and probably never will. Could care less how faithful the film is to the short story.
Having cleared the air on that. This is an AMAZING film. Set 50 years from now it is hysterical, dark and remarkably prescient of what has already come to pass since the original story was written. Even if Vonnegut's work only inspired the screenplay I must admit he really is the genius he's been touted as for the last 30 years. Can't believe the original story was written in 1961.
For plot details see the editorial reviews. If you like Kubrick, Blade Runner, the Coen Brothers, you will love this film and be glad you saw it. If you don't know what I'm talking about go watch Titanic or the Matrix. Have a beer, have a six pack or two,.... My only regret is I wasted the money renting it when for a few bucks more I could have bought it.

708720,4,6303801919,"I geatly appreciated much of Vonnegut's writing, and had read the short story which this must have been based on. While the story itself was quite short, leaving much to be filled in by the video, I feel that the video handled this in the spirit of Vonnegut's other works (I had recently seen the ""Breakfast of Champions"" which I thought reflected horribly on what is might be my favorite book of Vonnegut's). I would have given it 5 stars for the content, however I had to subtract one star because the quality of video is lacking; the acting isn't great, it's obviously made for TV, and the mood of the movie is greatly disturbed by the few long segments of jazz music.",991612800,4,671,4.463414634146342

The setting is a world in the near future where envy and inequality have been removed from American  society by making citizens equally unskilled and unintelligent through  technology, thus making everyone equal and giving no one any reason to be  jealous of anyone else.  The plot thickens as this philosophy is  challenged.
This has got to be one of the best Science Fiction Dramas  I've ever seen.  It touches the roots and ideas of our own society.",946857600,4,565,4.752577319587629

No one particularly liked the movies Mr. Roberts picked out, especially after that whole laser cancer thing.

The whole view of controlling intelligence, and what the  future may hold is portrayed in this movie so well, it's scary.  The ending  and the middle and the beginning and the whole point will leave you numb  with amazement.
If you enjoy this sort of movie, the kind that makes you  really think, I'd like to suggest a couple others.  1984 and The Truman  Show.  Two great movies that make you value what you really have.",943142400,4,719,4.619047619047619

7853221,5,6303801919,"This movie paints a (1950's like) world where everyone is equal, as opposed to everyone having equal opportunity. Naturally Harrison (Sean Astin) is not content with his world. He is earmarked and recruited for the elite job of taking care of items that can not be handled by the ""equal."" He finds unique ways to handle the situation that were not anticipated by his new colleagues.

No fair comparing this great made-for-TV-movie with Kurt Vonnegut's very short story that has a quick climax and an uneventful ending. I like made-for -TV- movies as they have to show the story and purpose with out a lot of glitz. Speaking of concepts, most people want to compare this movie to ""1984"" (1985). However the message is quite different. If you are going to do comparisons to similar concepts then you need to read ""This Perfect Day: A Novel "" by Ira Levin, which is almost the same story. Maybe ""Brave new World"" for the equal but really not trains of thought. After you look at similar concepts you should look at the opposite argument in ""Gattaca"".

It is too bad that this movie is rated ""R"", as it is ideal for teens, there are no au naturel scenes, and who uses expletives in the 1950's? The end may be a little graphic however it is very mild compared to most of toady's movies.
