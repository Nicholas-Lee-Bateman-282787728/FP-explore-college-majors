3747383,4,B001PJRAQ2,"There could have been about a 15 min. editing of the film, but ultimately one sat through and gave a goodly amount of reflection after. It makes for interesting discussion. A typically bickering, but gently prodding family with two sons, one about 11 and the older perhaps 16 or just 17. One morning when Dad takes the boys to school (bus has been missed), he passes by the school to the dismay and consternation of the boys. When asked what's happening, he crashes the car. The younger is momentarily unconscious, the older goes for help. Returning with aid, the father is missing. He is never located and the fragmentation of the wife and sons creates the dynamics for the plot. The inability to connect with each other causes further grief and misunderstandings within the wider family context. There will be an affirmative ending but the twists before and the questions of ethics make for much thought on the part of the viewer. It's a rich source of discussion.",1366329600,3,966,4.755952380952381
3747384,1,B001PJRAQ2,If you are into religious movies I guess this one would rate at least 2 stars.  If you are looking for a movie that made some sense don't watch this one.,1365552000,3,153,3.935483870967742
3747385,5,B001PJRAQ2,"Note well: In terms of narrative expectations, especially conventional expectations for resolution and closure by the end of the story, the film will prove unsatisfying to many viewers.  If you are comfortable with a very open-ended and ambivalent ""ending"" (and a fair amount of ambivalence throughout), this film will reward you in abundance.  This movie is terrific for a number of reasons:  The acting is outstanding; the writing is truthful and engaging; the direction is well beyond competent; and the list continues. Where it really shines is in its gradual revelation of the inner life and dynamics of the little family at its core and the relationship between the family's particular character and the National Religious sector of Israeli society to which it belongs. The National Religious, or Religious Zionist, population of Israel (roughly, though by no means entirely, equivalent to the Modern Orthodox in the U.S.) are seldom portrayed this honestly and non-judgmentally in either film or television (the Israeli TV show Srugim being a notable exception).  The Neo-realist idiom of the film (a difficult style to work with that, elsewhere, has often led to excruciatingly long and boring scenes)here creates a feeling of intimacy with the family, and the superb acting and chemistry between the characters keeps every scene fresh and engaging and rescues the viewer from feeling like he's stuck in the cinematic equivalent of the longest line in the grocery store.  In spite of (or maybe because of) the ambiguities in both then ending and the film itself, I've gone back to this film again and again (I'm on my 6th viewing at the time of this writing) and have yet to feel that my time was misspent.",1358553600,11,1714,5.0638297872340425
3747386,4,B001PJRAQ2,"I've been on a great run of movies out of Israel lately (more on that later) and I happened to pick this one up recently, not knowing much about it.

""Tehilim"" (95 min.; originally released in 2007) brings a deceptive initial 15 min. opening, in which we watch an average Jewish family in Jerusalem go about its business. Then one day, the dad, taking his 2 sons to school, gets into a strange car accident, sends his oldest son out for help, and upon the son's return to the scene of the accident, the dad is missing. We don't know know why or how. The rest of the movie brings the struggles of the wife and her sons, trying to adjust to a new life with a missing father. The movie focuses on the oldest son, who's (I'm guessing) 17 or so, trying to do the best he can, feeling depressed about the mysterious loss of his father. There is no happy ending, where everything is somehow explained or resolved.

This movie made quite a spash at the Cannes Film Festival, and it's easy to see why. Great acting all around, for one. If you like mainstream Hollywood movies, this is not for you. If on the other hand, you like challenging foreign/indie movies, then by all means check this out. And if you are looking for other great Israeli movies, let me just mention Lemon Tree, Or My Treasure, Free Zone, For My Father, Seven Minutes in Heaven, and of course last Fall's theatrical release Lebanon.",1298332800,7,1395,4.424124513618677
3747387,2,B001PJRAQ2,"I'm just not feeling it!  The acting was good, it was realistic , but I just kept waiting to have the story all lead up to something, anything, it left me hanging. The end was really disappointing , it just did not tie loose ends together...  so the mother gets the necessary paperwork to be able to support her children, so what? it was just plain disappointing. The movie lack ""life."" I certainly don't recommend this one. It's like someone forgot to add spices to the meal. BLAND. BLAND. Forget about it.",1242000000,2,507,4.5
3747388,4,B001PJRAQ2,"This film shines precisely because it refuses to wrap things up in a tidy package at the end.  And so we deal, along with the characters, with real life, which often doesn't have tidy endings.  The characters are all completely believable and authentic as a grieving family that seems to be coming apart at the seems.",1409702400,,317,4.642857142857143

3747393,3,B001PJRAQ2,"I wouldn't recommend this film that centers around a Jewish family with two brothers. The main attention is with the eldest brother, who is a confused and troubled adolescent. I felt that all the viewer was allowed to see was the surface of this family. The main plot was when their father disappears from the site of an accident. He may have had a stroke...it was never explained...he just wasn't there when help arrives. Although an extensive search is made there is no recovery of his body. The family is struggling because the legal and administrative circumstances have not allowed the mother access to the families money- This might have brought something more compelling into the story line...but even this aspect of this family's tragedy wasn't explored.
Basically the film drifts with no resolution for anyone and no real character development... it becomes tedious at best.",1394841600,,883,5.054794520547945

3747395,4,B001PJRAQ2,"It's a moving film about two children dazzled by their father mysterious disappearance.  They would do whatever they think it may work--even resorting to their interpretation of religion-- to get their father back.  It does not work, but somehow they learned to live with the disparate members of their extended family.",1388966400,,319,5.235294117647059
3747396,2,B001PJRAQ2,"While well acted, ""Tehilim"" fizzles when it could have sizzled.  The middle-aged husband disappears after a car accident, leaving his 2 sons (who were in the car) and his wife to deal with the resulting confusion.  The man's father and brother add to the stress of the situation because, from their orthodox religious perspective, they disagree strongly with every effort his more secular wife makes to restore some kind of equilibrium to the family.  Regimented police procedure and a daunting governmental bureaucracy sets up almost insurmountable barriers to any solution to the family's emotional and financial trauma.  Sound intriguing?  It is, until you realize that there is to be absolutely no resolution to the husband/father's disappearance.  He is simply gone! Did he just tire of family squabbles and decide to walk away?  Is he a victim of amnesia?  Was he taken by terrorists?  Is he himself a secret Palestinian sympathizer who has chosen this moment to opt out of Israeli society?  All of these are interesting possibilities which could have been explored, but the filmmaker leaves them all untouched.  No answers are ever offered, and the film ends with the wife and children sitting at a bus stop, the wife clutching documents she has just obtained from the police which will enable her to have him declared dead and to gain access to all his bank accounts, property, etc.  (Imagine a woman whose name is not on the family bank account, and there you have another dilemma that could have been explored as well!)  The film simply ends at that point, with no attempt to provide any explanation for what happened to the man or give any clear indication of how his family will proceed.  Life is often like this, I am afraid, in that we do not see neat outcomes or understand the motives of others.  We deal with that in daily life because we must, when viewing a film, I would prefer a story arc that ends with a true denouement.",1377993600,,1943,4.792792792792793
3747397,2,B001PJRAQ2,"I have no idea what this movie was about.  For the first fifteen minutes it seemed to have the potential to be a real good movie.  But after that point on it went down hill. "" What was the purpose of this movie?"" was a  a question left unanswered.  Tehillim had a beginning; unfortunately it lacked a middle and an ending.",1368576000,4,322,4.229508196721311

No resolution and no feeling of time well spent watching it. But if you want to hear Hebrew dialogue and see Israel on the screen it's OK.",1458259200,,307,4.293103448275862
8333391,4,B001PJRAQ2,"An unusual and powerful film that is engaging but not very enjoyable.  For most of the film, I assumed it would about a family's efforts to recover a missing person, but it turned out to be [spoiler alert] about family's efforts to deal with and adjust to an inexplicably missing person. In particular, the film is about unity or, rather, its absence.  The film opens with a talmudic lesson about someone who is so disoriented that he does not know in which direction to pray.  Like the High Priest in the Holy of Hollies, he can only turn his heart toward God.  In more normal circumstances, however, all Jews pray facing toward Jerusalem: thus, they pray with a kind of unity.  After this lesson, attended by father and son, we are introduced to a conflicted family.  The son turns out to be a troubled teen who uses drugs with friends and squabbles with his younger brother and with his worried father.  Later, we discover that the father comes from a more religious background than the mother.  When the teenage son goes to get help after a minor accident, the father inexplicably disappears.  Conflict results when the father's father, optimistic that the father will return, organizes large groups his son's apartment to pray (i.e., recite psalms [=Tehilim]) for his son's return.  The mother/wife, more pessimistic and cut off from his bank account, works to have him declared a missing person officially so that the family will be eligible for social services from the state.  The kids, especially, the teenage son is caught in the middle.  The film does a good job of showing how whatever he does creates a rift somewhere else.  When he goes to his grandfather's, his mother becomes distraught; when he stays at home, his grandfather and uncle are upset. Even when he tries to give charity and encourage prayer for his father, he discovers that he is encouraging the wrong people.

These rifts and the lesson at the beginning suggest the film should be seen as a metaphor.  The father's name is Eli, literally my god.  When he is at home everyone takes him for granted, though he worry about all.  When he leaves, the family tried to unite: the kids stop squabbling and the mother allows the grandfather to pray in the apartment, at least temporarily.  Ultimately, though, they do not succeed.  The uncle is named Aaron, the name of the high priest, and the younger brother is David, the name of the putative author of the psalms.  The main character, the teenage boy, is Menachem.  His name means the comforter, but ironically he consistently fails. As I understand it, these are people who are so disoriented that they do not know in which direction to face.  Whether God is present or absent, they are at a loss, but with his absence the characters do begin to assume some responsibility for their lives.  So, too, Israel is composed of a variety of disparate groups struggling to work together.  Ultimately, I think this film is about the difficulties of Jewish people finding unity.",1440374400,,2996,4.761627906976744
8333392,1,B001PJRAQ2,Great cast - s***ty movie. I'm sorry for every penny they got from a national foundation to film a bad movie which doesn't go anywhere.,1420070400,,135,4.44

8333394,4,B001PJRAQ2,"This movie is about process, not  product.  As other reviewers have pointed out, if you insist on closure, you probably won't like Tehilim.  But if you prefer a movie that continues to engage you after viewing it, then watch this one.

I thought the characters' behavior, reactions, and motivations were spot on!

parenthetical comment, which would be great deal more meaningful if you knew me and I were actually saying this out loud to you with appropriate facial expressions and hand gestures:
( I was half-way through Srugim  -- we're talking 20 or so episodes here, people -- before it hit me that Reut's name means friendship.  Then I hit ""pause"" and thought about the rest of the characters' names. All significant.  Best example.... Who truly thought he was God's gift to women?  Why, could it be...........Nati?  Why, yes, it could. Because -- wait for it -- Nati is the short version of Nataniel, i.e.  God gives.  Ah, and did  I learn from this experience?  Maybe, because it was only 30 or so minutes into Tehilim before it hit me that the older son's name means ""comfort."")",1415145600,,1086,4.737967914438503
8333395,4,B001PJRAQ2,"Apparently this needs to be stated in simple language:

If you need a movie to hold you by the hand and tell you want to think, this is not the movie for you.

One reviewer complained that the complexities weren't explored in depth. If all the problems in the film were handled in depth, it would have been 7 hours long. Think for yourself. Use your own intellect. If you like movies that allow you -- and require you -- to think for yourself, you are more likely to enjoy this one.

Another reviewer complained that the movie is ""too much like life."" This is not an escapist film meant to entertain you. This is not a Hollywood blockbuster. It is an observation of a family traumatized by the disappearance of its leader and the tsurit that take his place.

This is a good film for those who appreciate the traditional Jewish view that one should be encouraged to use his own intellect to develop understanding -- an understanding of our place of the world, of the proper way to behave when things aren't going your way. Like traditional Jewish study, you are given suggestions and some guidance, but you are expected to do the real work yourself.

You aren't a child. You don't need to be given a resolution wrapped in a nice little package, as if such things really followed tragedy.",1412035200,2,1286,4.502145922746781
