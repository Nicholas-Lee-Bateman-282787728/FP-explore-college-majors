8521304,4,B007R7V3MS,A good and solid biopic of Bismarck just prior to the establishment of the German Empire. Made in Germany 1940. The film has little in the way of propaganda and mostly factual with some supposition but far less than in contemporary films.,1508803200,,238,4.690476190476191

8521306,5,B007R7V3MS,"This was a very good film for me personally as I didn't know all that much about Bismarck. I'm reading a biography on him so it was a good primer for understanding the man.

The movie copy itself was very good as far as clarity goes, no real issues with film degradation and such.

Production values were excellent as most of the films during the NS period goes. Excellent acting and great film work. I was very pleased with it many levels. Great historical film.",1410998400,7,463,4.435294117647059
