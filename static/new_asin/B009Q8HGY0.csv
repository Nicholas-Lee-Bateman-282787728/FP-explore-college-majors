Other reviews have commented that this is one of the finest anime series they have seen in a long time - clever plot, humorous and original, earning it a place in the top ten of many best anime series polls. That prompted me to take a look, not least because reviewers believed the script explored time travel theory in some detail. Well, I didn't find any of that to be true. The series really doesn't start to get going until half way through the second series. I think this Anime is aimed at younger teens as opposed to any other age group.

Basically, a student rents an apartment above a TV repair shop and, eventually, one day discovers that he can switch his phone on while his microwave is on and, so long as one of the TVs is turned on in the shop below, he can send so many seconds of his most recent memory back in time to himself to alter how events unfold. Later on, the daughter of one of his flatmates shows up, from the future, arriving in a time machine that her father built, requesting help to change events to avoid a future world war three, which she has lived through.

With the time machine, the student and the girl can travel back and forth in time together to, hopefully, avert world war three and the death of fellow friends. This is the place you find yourself at mid way through season two.

The plot is quite simple and uncomplicated, the theory and practicalities of time travel are really only vaguely touched upon and are not explored in any real depth. They remain largely unexplored. Until half way through the second season, the student spends all his time doing the same thing over and over again, as he sends memories back in time to help his former self prevent the death of his friend. Each time he attempts to prevent the death, it still happens, just in a different way. So, for the most part, this anime is relatively boring and repetitive. If the series was to be so short, really things needed to move along at a much faster pace to progress and extend the story.

In comparison to Death Note, I would not say this series is even half as intelligent, detailed, complex or interesting. In summary, this is one to avoid - watch it on YouTube or something. It is certainly not worth spending more than $9.1 USD on! ;)",1421020800,,2380,4.387755102040816
