2691563,3,B000KHYN9W,"Would have liked to have seen more of the goals, Brosnan sleepwalks through the very skimpy and unrevealing commentary.

The best Video FIFA ever produced was GOL!, the 1982 World cup summary, with a great commentary by Sean Connery. Would like a DVD of that one!",1170288000,5,263,4.717391304347826
2691564,5,B000KHYN9W,"Overall - A top quality documentary that provides a flowing tour through the last rounds of the World Cup.  Brosnan provides interesting commentary without distracting from the mood.  Loads of exciting action with many longer segments that immerse you into pivotal (and sometimes unusual) moments of the matches.

Video Quality - Created from original HD footage and made into 480p 16:9 format.  Looked very nice even on our 110"" (279cm) HD projector, but knowing that HD World Cup content exists I am hoping for a future BluRay Disc release.

Sound Quality - Lots of great sound of the crazy fans, (but seemingly no DD 5.1, only Dolby Pro-Logic?).

Extras - Have not watched interviews yet.

If you love the game, then this DVD will put you head over heels.",1169596800,9,758,4.829457364341085

2691567,1,B000KHYN9W,"I generally don't review products on Amazon cos mostly all is said and done by other reviewers. But, when i saw the reviews for this product i was surprised to see that people had actually liked it.

Before i begin the review, i want to pose a question. Name one team sport that is broadcast from a ground-level point of view. Don't think too hard cos there isn't any. And this is my primary concern with this DVD. Most of the shots in the DVD are closeups of the action rather than showing a bigger picture.

The camera angles selected are utterly meaningless and painful to watch. Meaningless, because when you are watching any sport, you want to see a stands-level point of view that gives you a picture of how a move is executed. Painful, because it causes great strain on your eyes to watch players running on the field with speed in front of a colorful audience.

Imagine watching NFL or NHL or any other sport from the sidelines(on TV). It just doesn't work.

This concern aside, i am also disappointed with the content. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they have skipped some of the important matches(like one of the quarter-finals, Brazil's exit and the 3rd place play-off) in favor of covering some others in great detail. Detail would be fine but certainly not with these camera shots. Also, there is no match commentary, which causes most of the excitement when watching sports live.

There is nothing good about this DVD, besides the fact that its a DVD and you can watch it on TV. It's not as if you don't have a choice. You can always go to the FIFA website and catch the highlights there [...]

PS - Pierce Brosnan is not much annoying as he speaks quite rarely and generally has something useful to say.",1270425600,,1726,4.533762057877814
2691568,1,B000KHYN9W,"I cannot watch the product I bought, because I think it is produced only for the non European market. In future it will be goood to know whether the dvd is watchable in all countries or only on limited markets.",1234051200,,210,4.275
2691569,5,B000KHYN9W,"its fantastic!!!! I love the way and style that they review the matches, the camera angles the narration. Easily the best thing you will watch on the 2006 world cup. Not as good as the 1982 world cup film but this one is really a winner",1230422400,,236,4.1521739130434785
2691570,4,B000KHYN9W,"I am a little bit upset about not seeing many of the goals scored in the tournament. Just key games were included in the video and most of them were qualifiers. Visual quality is very good, camera angle in the games is so great that it makes you think you are inside of the stadium.",1210550400,,282,4.1454545454545455
2691571,5,B000KHYN9W,"This is a great product for anybody who is a soccer fan. If you are interested in behind the scenes or the player's view of the game scenarios, this movie is for you. If you are a soccer historian, this movie is for you. If you want to learn moves, or teach someone about soccer, this movie is not for you, this is strictly a historical perspective, it may motivate you or your team but it's not for training purposes. Great product.",1205193600,,433,4.2926829268292686
2691572,4,B000KHYN9W,"The 2006 World Cup was a truly great spectacle in sports, and this DVD is nearly perfect.  The video quality and editing are superb, and the time and attention to the final matches is exquisite.  However, the video does have shortcomings.  The Argentina-Mexico game, in which Maxi Rodriguez scored the FIFA Best Goal of the World Cup in extra time, is not even mentioned, and Maxi's goal is not shown.  Some footage of the USA national team is thrown in, seemingly in a shameless attempt to draw American fans.  I understand that some cutting of corners is necessary to reduce a 50-plus-game World Cup to less than three hours of footage, but I question some of the choices of what was included and what was omitted.

What is shown, however, is an outstanding spectacle.  Even though I saw both the England/Portugal matches and the Italy/France final when they were on TV, I was still riveted by their presentation on the DVD.  As I said, the camera work and action are out of this world and sure to please any soccer fan.  (Take special note of the England/Portugal match; when Wayne Rooney is sent off and a Portugal player tries to console him, Wayne can clearly be seen shouting ""F--- off!"")  For anyone who wants to celebrate the World Cup and all the personalities that made it shine - Cristiano Ronaldo, Stephen Gerrard, Michael Ballack, Fabio Cannavaro, and the others - you really can't go wrong with this DVD.",1202428800,,1419,4.685483870967742
2691573,4,B000KHYN9W,"I do not own the DVD, saw it last night on HBO, and thought of going online and buying it to watch it with my family, huge Italy fans.  Remember this was one whole month of the worlds finest teams playing against each other, so trying to squeeze all that soccer into a 2hr film would definitely result in a lot of things being left out.  It was great to re-live those glorious moments for Italy.  Although I agree that it would have been pleasing to re-live Brazil's elimination as well.  Go Italy!!!",1202169600,,500,4.344086021505376
2691574,1,B000KHYN9W,"Being a huge Italian soccer fan, I was extremely disappointed in this video since it is a recap of their glory to World Cup triumph. There are many games not including the Italian team that are not featured or let alone mentioned. Perhaps the best game of the tournament, Mexico-Argentina is not shown let alone mentioned. The Brazil-France match also has no video footage. The Portugal team has features on 3 of their games, the same amount as the Italian team that WON the World Cup. The DVD fails to show any highlights of the second round games of Australia-Italy or Italy-Ukraine. No highlights of many other matches and the continued stereotype (this time by narrator Pierce Brosnan, who was good but did not have much of a script to read from) depicting the Italians as ultra-defensive but failing to mention they scored the second most goals in the tournament and had the most multiple players to score at least one goal (10). I hope there is a better DVD of Italy's 4th World Cup so that I can enjoy it years from now because this current DVD is in my trash.

2691575,2,B000KHYN9W,"Michael Apted's film of the 2006 World Cup Finals is bizarre because it doesn't include footage of the two best goals of the tournament (Joe Cole for England against Sweden and Maxi Rodriguez for Argentina against Mexico). Also, there is extensive video of matches that were dull while no footage of the best match of the tournament, France's victory over Brazil, is included.  Zidane's performance against Brazil, where he almost singlehandedly controlled the entire match, is where he demonstrated that he is one of the greatest players of all time.",1193788800,,551,5.122222222222222
2691576,5,B000KHYN9W,"I am catching up with the most of all World Cup Soccer results. I own a 3-DVD set from 1978 - 2002. That's also a really god one. Of course I do like all the goal scenes. But that's not the only one way to watch soccer and this DVD is edited in that way, the way I see it. This one includes lots of off-the-goal-scenes that affected the games. And it's spotting on only on some tight and close matches of the tornament. Narration, stating the plain facts, is as minimum as possible but with all the raw scenes. I like that way. I didn't have chance to watch the games last year but I believe I have experienced the essence of this final with this DVD. I don't think I'd like to own another DVD to catch up with just for all the goals (I am not criticizing that DVD!!). So, if you are a serious soccer fan, I bet you like this DVD. Again, goal is not the only ""goal"" to watch soccer!!",1184371200,,883,4.0227272727272725
2691577,3,B000KHYN9W,"I thought the camera work, and angles of some of the footage was tremendous. Being an italian fan, I was not too thrilled that they picked their quarter final game as one of 2 not shown. I purchased film because I thought Pearce Brosnan would add something dynamic to film, instead it sounded as if he was doing play by play for golf- very disappointing.",1182816000,,354,4.461538461538462
2691578,2,B000KHYN9W,"How can you miss the signature play of the Tournament?  Maxi Rodriguez goal of the tournament was no where to be found, instead they spent wayyyyyyyyyyyy to much time on other games.  This video was poorly crafted, the narration was slim, and there was too much dead air.  I watched all the games, I didn't need to see them again in their entirety.  What I needed was a summary of the tournament from the group stage through the elimination rounds.  Many elimination games were missed and that was just sad.  Fifa should take a hard look at this video and create another disk of highlights to cover the ones that were missed.  A prequel is in order.

Oh and by the way, I don't need to see EVERY yellow card in the Portugal / Netherlands game.  Come on.  You guys making this should  know better than that.",1174608000,2,806,4.414965986394558

I mean do the French fans order this to say ""wow remember how we lost in the finals on penality kicks to Italy.""  Do the USA fans want to see highlights on how they were eliminated in the first round?  No Italian fans are the people who are going to order this.

I watched most of the World Cup games and while I agree there are some major omissions, the DVD did get a lot of the key moments right.  This is an enjoyable two-hour scrapbook of the World Cup, and as the teams advance, the coverage of each game gets more in-depth--thus the early-round games are slighted to some extent.  However, the late-round games are presented brilliantly and edited very well.  Recommended.",1171756800,,620,4.660550458715596

It is disappointing, the dvd could have been better.  Only true soccer fans will appreciate the video since there is a dearth of good quality soccer dvds.",1171670400,,372,4.522388059701493
2691584,3,B000KHYN9W,"Even though the quality of footage is good, this DVD misses so many exciting points of the last world cup.  The group stage is dealt with in basically 5 minutes, with a few highlights of selected games.

Argentina - Serbia, for example, only 1 goal shown.  France - Brazil game omitted, France - Spain game also ommited.  Nothing said about controversial Italy - USA, or Italy - Australia game.  About half of the teams competing were not shown, let alone mentioned!

Highlights of England - Portugal (1/4 final), France - Portugal  (semifinal) and Italy - Germany (semifinal) each goes on for 10 minutes, way to much for these games that produced 3 goals in total!!! waste of time, they should have used that time for more group games.

Overall, very dissapointed, although the highlights of the final game and the interviews were good.  Not what I expected. The 1982 and 1986 world cup highlight videos were the best, in my opinion.  If I knew it would be like that, I would not have gotten this DVD.",1171497600,21,1002,4.642045454545454
2691585,5,B000KHYN9W,"The Fifa 2006 World Cup Film - The Grand Finale is an Exciting DVD and is Narrated by Pierce Bronsnan. The DVD Is in letter box format and looks and sounds beautiful. Special features include interviews with players Cannavaro; Nakata; Lehmann; Ballack; and Drogba as well as an interview of Final game referee Elizendo.

The Film starts off with a sand lot soccer Game and then proceeds to the fan feasts and on to the game. We get the Beautiful game quote from Pala and off we go. We start of with he opening game of the round of 32 round Robin type set up-where 16 out of 32 teams move on to the next round. The first game is Germany the home nation VS Costa Rica and Germany goes on to win 4-2 in the highest scoring opening game of world cup history. The film process to highlight key games as Germany; Australia; Spain(who true to form win all three fist round games and then lose in the Quarter finals); England; Argentina who wins 6-0 in the first game; Italy; Brazil the pre tournament favorite; Ghana; Switzerland; The Ukraine; France; The Netherlands; Portugal; Mexico; Sweeten; and Ecuador. The USA had a disappointing showing this time with the one highlight of fighting the eventual World Cup Winner Italy to a 1-1 tie.

The next Round is the round of 16 nd now its win and you move on and lose and you go home. The elimination rounds begin. The DVD Highlights key games in both the first two rounds but does not cover every game. later on in the semis and the finals we get extensive converge of al those games. England over Ecuador 1-0; GERMANY BEATS Sweden 2-0; Argentina BEATS Mexico 2-1; Portugal defeats the Netherlands 1-0; France knocks off Spain 3-1; The Ukraine over Switzerland 3-0 in a shoot out; And Italy defeats Australia 1-0 in a tight one where Italy plays one man down, due to red card, most of the game.

Now we move on to the Quarter finals and again just key games are covered. Germany defeats Argentina 4-2 in a  shoot out after a 1-1 tie in regulation and extra time;Portugal wins 3-1 in a shoot out over England (0-0); France stunned Brazil 1-0; and Italy easily defeats the Ukraine 3-0.

Now we move on to the semi finals and we get extensive converge of these two games. Italy defeats Germany in a tight well played game with many scoring opportunities for both teams, 2-0. Italy scored both goals very late in the game. And France beats Portugal 1-0 in a nail bitter. Both of these games was excellent and the Italy Germany game is a top 5 world cup game. It was very exciting.

Then we go to the finals. Italy Vs France. It is a very good game but is marred by a few things. One France scores on a penalty kick after a dive early in the game, they need replay on this type of thing. Two Italy has a goal taken away on an off sides call, another bad call. and third Zadine gets himself tossed on a red card in extra time with a violent head [...]. But despite that the game was an exciting 1-1 draw then went all the way to penalty kicks. Italy had never won a game on penalty kicks and even lost the 1994 World Cup to Brazil on penalty shots,  but this time there were perfect scoring on all five shots and winning 5-3. Congratulations Italy a great win; Italy's 4th World Cup.

In conclusion the The Fifa 2006 World Cup Film - The Grand Finale is a great watch and a must have for soccer fans everywhere.",1170288000,14,3346,4.3424
8157038,5,B000KHYN9W,"This is my favorite football movie of all time. Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I will go back and watch this. I love everything about this movie, from the cinematography, the soundtrack, the colors and tones they used to shoot the footage in, to the narration, and everything else. Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I'll go back and watch this, and relive one of the best moments during one of the best years of my life.

I always cry and get excited and so happy when I see Italy winning, as seeing a team you've poured your heart and soul into win The Big Crown is one of the most thrilling and purest forms of ecstasy one can experience. Ten years on, I still hang onto every moment, and have every word about Italy's monumental victory embedded deep within my heart. And I have it there so I'll never be able to forget such a monumental and wonderful moment in time.

Though I love nearly everything about this film, it does have its minor drawbacks, in the form of a few key, and crucial games that are missing, such as the game between Mexico and Argentina and more importantly, Maxi Lopez's goal. I would have loved to Pierce Brosnan's narration of that. I would have also have loved to have seen the game between Brazil and France included here, especially considering it would have been entertaining to hear the film attempt to be diplomatic about how petulant Brazil were during that game.

And as much as I love the final game between Italy and France, I do think that the writers for The Grand Finale should have been more fair and stated that Materazzi exchanged words with Zidane, and that's what led Zidane to headbutt him. It would have given the final scenes more parity, and a more nuanced picture of what happened (and mind you, this is coming from someone who is a huge Italy fan).

However, those inconveniences are minor.

This aside, I still watch this film from time to time when I need a shot of happiness injected into my veins. I still cry tears of joy over Fabio Grosso's goals, both in the semi-final against Germany and L'Ultimo Rigore that won everything for Italy. I still lose it and cry whenever I hear the horns that lead into 'Stand Uuuuuuuuuuup For The Champions', and let the happiness fall like confetti over me as Patrizio Buanne's rich tones lift me into a higher plane of joy, as I celebrate the night we won everything.

And I get so delirious with joy when I see Alessandro Del Piero looking at the cup in both disbelief and awe as he can't believe he's won it; when I see Gigi Buffon kiss and raise the cup in his golden hands; and most of all, when I see Il Capitano, Fabio Cannavaro lifting the cup in exultant triumph, with the biggest and most purest smile broadening across his face, as his face, soaked with tears of joy, conveys all of the happiness we all felt along with him. It was a special moment in time, and one that I can't properly articulate into words. You just had to have been there to experience it, and to understand why this moment truly makes me so happy, and what it means to me.

The World Cup that took place in Germany in 2006 was not only special because of Italy's triumph, but it also marks the last time we got to see so many stars -- Deco, Luis Figo, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kak, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, and of course, Zizou -- at the height of their respective powers, but it also marks the last time three of the world's footballing superpowers -- Italy, Brazil and France -- were truly great before the inevitable decline and process of rebuilding set in.

As you can see, I clearly love this film very much, mainly because it makes me think of Italy's magical and monumental triumph back in 2006. It makes me happy, because it makes me think of one of the best years of my life, and it's a moment in time I desperately want to relive again. But since I know I won't, I'll just carry these happy memories along with me. And I'll relive them by watching this film over and over again.",1451520000,,3966,4.415868673050616
