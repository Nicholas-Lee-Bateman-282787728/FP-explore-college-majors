80619,5,0788832182,"It really bothered me that so many people took the portrayal of Mr. Bubbles the social worker as that as a ""bad guy."" He was seen as bad through the experience of Lilo and Nani, because he was a force that would separate them. His character was a counter-balance to the concept of ohana. I think the portrayals of all of the human characters were wonderful - they were more realistic than the idealistic, stylized performances of characters in other Disney movies. I think this was a wonderful movie for older children, teenagers, and adults. I am so glad that the Disney animation team is finally breaking out of the corner they drew themselves into (pardon the pun). Lilo and Stitch is a movie that pushes the envelope a bit, while still retaining the old family spirit of the classic Disney films. This movie is more than what you see on the surface. Don't be afraid to look for the message.",1031011200,,894,4.559006211180124
80620,5,0788832182,"This movie is by far the best animated Disney movie in years! I saw the trailer for the movie about 1 month before it came to theaters and I knew that i had to see this movie. The first thing that i noticed was the cute little alien who acted like a dog on earth. I also noticed that this was not going to be a cheesy movie like so many other cartoons. So when the movie came out, I saw it the first day it was released into theaters. The begining of the movie was very action and comedy packed 15 minutes. Then i saw the little girl lilo for the first time and noticed that she was the outkasted friend in the group of girls in her dance class, and all the while trying to deal with the problems of her older sister nani trying to gain custody of her. This whole sequence of the movie was rather tear-jerking and emotional and at the same time funny. Then when Stitch came into the picture, things began to heat up. The movie suddenly became funnier and sadder as the movie progressed. But enough of my talking, the movie was a very emotional one ane a definate for the whole family to watch.",1030665600,,1093,4.136150234741784

80622,5,0788832182,"Disney movies typically are based on fairy tales, folk lore, children's stories or influential literature.

The movie consists of two stories, Stitch's and Lilo's, both of which are different takes on The Ugly Duckling.

Stitch's creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba is found guilty of illegal genetic engineering (creating Stitch) and Stitch (known before his meeting with Lilo at the shelter as Experiment 626) is sentenced to exile on an asteroid after offending the council. He escapes his prison pod and hijacks a police cruiser, activated hyperdrive and ends up en route to Kauai, Hawaii

Meanwhile, a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo is coping with the changes with her sister Nani being in charge after their parents were killed in a road accident. Under the supervision of Cobra Bubbles, a freelancer among social workers, Nani is to get her life in order and a job to support herself and Lilo.

Not long after Cobra's visit, 626 crashlands in the Kauai Rainforest and get hit by a truck (Luckily, his genetic makeup makes him pretty indestructible). He ends up at the animal shelter and Lilo meets him, making known as Stitch from then on.

Cobra comes back to add another item to the list: make Stitch into a model citizen.

Like most of Disney's animated features from 1937 to 2011, this was hand drawn and for this film features watercolor painting backgrounds, which were featured in early Disney films.

The music composed of Alan Silvestri's score, two original songs sung by a Hawaiian children's choir and a local celebrity in Hawaii and of course, some of Elvis Presley's hits which are sung either by The King himself or by artists covering him in the spirit of the movie. Its eclectic charm highlights the personality of the entire setting and characters (Lilo and Stitch)

The vocals are just great. I didn't know much about Daveigh Chase (voice of Lilo) as an up and coming star and I really haven't heard much since Leroy and Stitch. Daveigh's credits include Samara in the American Version of The Ring and Sen\Chihiro in the English dub of Spirited Away (a production produced by Disney in conjunction with the currently in limbo Studio Ghibli). For the actors who lived in Hawaii, they gave insight to cast members who lived elsewhere in vocal acting by teaching terminology and local language.
Tia Carrere has numerous credits and yes, after watching Wayne's World 1, I am stuck with a visual that comes from the fact she didn't really change her voice.
Stitch is voiced by his creator, Chris Sanders, who also directed and wrote the movie.

Fun fact: Preliminary art dating back to 1985 shows that Stitch originally looked like a monitor lizard than a blue koala.

The movie was rated PG for Mild Sci-fi Action. However, the concept of all inclusive family values in that ""Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind or forgotten"" is a value I hold dear. I even add the notion of ""lost"" to my definition of this value.

It's been a while since I last saw this movie and it did not disappoint. It's like I remembered it all those years ago.",1522454400,,3068,4.780718336483932

80657,5,0788832182,"The movie, Lilo, and Stitch was chosen because this movie taught me that family is something that will never go away. In the beginning of the movie, Lilo begins to tell stitch that he has nothing to worry about she tells him to, just be yourself,.  Luckily some families are able to look past the differences and still treat them how they deserve to be treated.  Lilo and her sister became that family that would allow him to be his self with no strings attached. She learned that she loved stitch and wanted the best for him, so they became a bigger family this connects back to class when we spoke nohow family didn't need to just be blood-related. The director of the movie makes it a clear point that he wants the audience to understand family should be put on everything and that a family should always have each others back. Lilo sees how Stitch feels disappointed and not welcomed at times, because of his way of showing he cared. She tells him that even though sometimes he makes huge messes, they will always forgive him, not because were all related, but because were one happy family,. Family accepts each other for who they are. They do not expect each other to change how they are just to be loved.  She always reassures  Lilo that you're different your one of a kind,. She knows that Stitch and all his cousins are related through blood, and is willing to accept them all as apart of her big Ohana and  family means no-one left behind. Even though Lilo did not know any of them, she was ready to accept them for the sake of Stitch. She saw his family as her family too. To Jumba and Bleakly, Lilo, her sister, and of course David were their new, tiny adopted earth family,  and they were not ready to give that up yet. At the end, even though Stitch does not realize that they are the family she still didn't want to give away cumin cause hes his Ohana. She was ready to expand make everyone realize that they were apart of their family.
 Also, in the beginning, we see Bleakly wearing Lilos sister's clothes. Throughout the movie, the sex of Bleakly is not spoken of.  Bleakly dresses like a girl even though he sounds as if he is a boy. It is easier to look at someone the way you want to when they don't come out and say who they are. No-one speaks directly to Bleakly about it but it is shown to us that Bleakly is trying to gain an identity by wearing these clothes. The author does this in order for us to see the charter for who they are. Bleakly was shown to be accepted by everyone else. A families job is to make sure that another member is comfortable being around them.",1512691200,,2595,4.336082474226804
80658,4,0788832182,"This is a great movie to describe the non traditional family because of the fact that they took aliens in to become apart of their family by the end. Two of the main characters are sisters who lost their parent. They are all the family that either one has. It is not traditional for a sister to raise her younger siblings, and not having a male role that the children can look up to also. They family becomes whole after the long and hard journey with Stitch. After the social worker did not take Lilo away, Nani felt as if she did a good job and could raise her younger sister perfectly fine.",1512691200,,593,4.256637168141593
80659,5,0788832182,"""Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten."" This Hawaiian family became broken when their parents died in a car accident, and now Lilo's older sister Nani has to raise her. This is a wonderful family movie, despite everything that happens throughout the movie the love never dies. One thing that every family shares despite their differences is love.",1512604800,,383,5.095238095238095
80660,5,0788832182,"This is a great movie to see how individuals from two worlds can become a huge part of each others lives. An alien from a galaxy created an experiment called 626 that has escaped and ended up on earth.  A young girl named Lilo lives with her older sister named Nani in Hawaii. Lilo and Nani live without their parents because they died in an accident. Nani noticed that Lilo felt lonely and let her get a dog. Little did they know, the dog Lilo had picked was the alien that had escaped from an alien planet. Lilo named her new friend Stitch. My favorite part of the movie was when Stitch said, This is my family. I found it all on my own. It`s little, and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good. An experiment named 626 that meant barely anything to aliens meant the whole world to Lilo. That experiment is named Stitch and he completes her family.",1512432000,,851,4.31875
80661,4,0788832182,"When Lilo and her sister Nani struggle to get along they decide they need a change.

Stitch, the dog they adopt is secretly experiment 626. An alien who is powerful and being chased by the people who created him. When they take Lilo it is up to Stitch to show that he truly loves being apart of the family and saves her. The social worker turned out to be an old CIA agent and then takes over the family and watches over them. This is a great family movie that teaches the importance of sticking together with your family. Not only does it also show the difficulty in raising a child, but it shows the judicial situation of trying to keep a family together when the parents are no longer there.",1512345600,,880,4.307228915662651

80669,5,0788832182,"This movie has been one of my favorites for YEARS. I've had 2 different DVD versions, and been trying to get a digital one for some time. The timeless story of this adorably naughty little alien experiment who gets adopted by a little Hawaiian girl who mistakes him for a puppy is incredibly sweet, with beautifull messages about the power and importance of love and family, as well as the ability of people to be able to change and be taught how to be better. The writing and casting is BRILLIANT, and the art style and animation is gorgeous! Does a wonderful job on both the cold metalicness of space and the world of the aliens to the warm multicolored brightness of Hawaii, all with a distinctive, realistic-yet stylized and curvy watercolor style. And the CG space ships are INCREDIBLY well done! Unlike alot of CG rendered to look hand drawn, It's hard to tell they are originally 3D models. And the music is great. One of my particular favorites is the 2 Hawaiian songs and all the Elvis songs used. Matter of fact, this movie was sort of my introduction to Elvis music! Fun for kids and adults alike!",1508112000,2,1108,4.545

80701,3,0788832182,"Really neat film! I like the traditional hand drawn animation with Watercolored backgrounds.  This film reminds me of Japanese master animator Hayao Miyazaki and his imaginary films that touch both kids and adults alike.  This film does not sugar coat things like other Disney films tend to do.  Adults need to watch this film with Documentary as well to understand why Director made a film this sociological in nature. Without spoiling anything about this film. It's about a 2 sisters who lost their parents in an accident. The focus is on a little girl who tries to cope with the situation in the only way she can by behaving badly. Until she adopts a dog/alien from the pound who behaves much worse than her. It's a non stop emotional ride with little comedy thrown in here and there. Some plot holes, her older sister may have a drinking problem for behaving the way she does towards her kid sister.  Huge problem, with the writing because Lilo's behavior in inconsistent with her character.  Besides Stitch, and those girls in her Hula class couldn't she find some other friends, preferably boys to run around with !!!  I am glad they edited the film for the content. There was this huge September 11/01 style plane hijack situation that was not part of the film. Various scenes of sadness loneliness and violence where also removed. I am glad they didn't go all the way with it.  In the documentary one of the lead animators said he was bullied as a child. May be a good film to teach your kids not to fight with other kids that are different or came from broken families.",1486425600,,1578,4.614285714285714

80704,3,0788832182,"Pretty good movie but i felt disney made this way to softcore. The Lion King is alot more darker and mature for a disney movie. Lilo and stitch is the complete opposite due to being aimed for kids, the same kids who watch these movies.
So after stitches appearance, we see our second protagonist. Lilo. A very dumb and a brat of a character, skipping dance class to feed a fish. Yes thats right. She goes out of her way to get peanut butter to feed a fish a sandwhich, why? Whats the point? No wonder her ""friends"" don't like her. Shes weird, she stops to take a photo of some dude, arrives at the dance still wet, causeing the other dancers to slip and fall. Ugh ok
We then meet her older sister. So no parents?
And lilo and the later stitch cause the whole island to panic, which is what he is intended to do but soon grows to love hes new home and family.
The older sister loses her job cause of a accident
But the fire dancer gets to keep hes? How is that fair? Its not and its dumb
A fbi agent randomly comes out of nowere
Has the title of child services which are two different things
Who should be looking out for the alien
Not lilo :/
Jamba is fired from the job
So a shark alien comes to do the job
But captures lilo? Ugh fail
You were supposed to get stitch -_-
You know the terrorizing threat that must be captured. But gets to stay cause oh lilo payed two whole dollars for him and by taken him its stealing?
Ugh no! Not eveything can be your way or let remain free. If stitch is a loose cannon experiment of forbidden science
Then the alien visitors have full right to do what they must but they just shrug it off like its no big deal.
And the whole evolution is dumb writing at its worst
Life does not restart everytime its hit by a rock
That is huge misleading and stupid logic
And the writer should ashamed and laughed at
So dumb",1484697600,,1845,4.113573407202216

It encourage children to learn that being different is okay and to express themselves. Lilo and Stitch learn from each other that being different was better than being something they were not. The film gives a relate-able vibe toward the characters because there are families just like Lilo and Nani as a dysfunctional family or household. For someone who wants their children to have an understanding of family and being different in a family, I would highly recommend this movie to watch as a family.",1481068800,,606,4.950980392156863

80778,4,0788832182,"A tropical paradise surrounded by crystal clear blue water and small alien inhabitant best friends with a 5 year old native Hawaiian girl. Lilo & Stitch is a great film for all ages but is especially present in the lives of young, influential minds. This film presents common misconception of the Pacific Islands. Not everyone surfs or wears dresses with tropical flowers or short shorts and a tank top.

When we meet Lilo in the beginning of the movie, she is coming out of the ocean and is on her way to hula lessons. We also see her surfing with her older sister and friend and teaching Stitch how to play the guitar. It feels like a vacation advertisement to the Hawaiian Islands where women meet you at the plane wearing Leis and you can drive around the island to the different beautiful beaches with cool blue water and then head to a luau for dinner for some traditional Hawaiian entertainment and roasted pig. These tourist images are warping the image of Pacific Island culture into Indo-European views and don't represent the culture outside of what is presented to tourists on their yearly holiday or vacation.

The dark skin tone and unique facial features make clear to the audience that Lilo and her older sister and other characters are portraying people from Hawaii. The Pacific Island portrayal is rounded out nicely with a tropical background and a lot of common activities associated when visiting the Hawaiian Islands. The colonial fiction of a tropical paradise where all your worries wash away in the golden sand and indigo waters is built on misconceptions white people have about Hawaii and the tropical islands of the Pacific. Lilo & Stitch is an amazing film that portrays a little girl and her alien best friend on a beautiful, tropical island but also the colonial narrative of what sets America and Indo-European cultures above the rest.",1465430400,,1867,4.83125

80796,5,0788832182,"Lilo is a little girl from the state of Hawaii. She is raised by her sister Nani. Lilo and Nani have been dealing with the loss of their parents. After a visit from a social worker, Nani hears Lilo pray for an angel to come. Nani then decides that the best angel for Lilo is a dog. Lilo finds Stitch, an alien created by a mad scientist, and decides to take him in.
There are so many reasons why I give Lilo & Stitch a perfect score. For starters, the writers decided to tell a story of a family going through hard times and they do such an excellent job. I found myself caring for Lilo and Nani, hoping for things to end in the usually happy way that Disney movies do.
I also love the character Stitch. He has the friendly looks of ET and some of the most energetic antics I have ever seen in a cartoon character. Stitch is an absolute welcome sight for any die hard Disney fan.
The animation is also spectacular. The use of Hawaii as the setting gives Lilo & Stitch a beautiful looking back drop. The use of water colors being blended in with traditional animation is stunning.
Lilo & Stitch also has a great soundtrack with a perfect selection of Elvis Presley songs that are complemented by the score of Back to the Future composer Alan Silvestri.
The movie also delivers important messages for kids in a very entertaining way. Stitch is the perfect solution for the trouble that Lilo and Nani have been facing, but during the films climax it seems as though they feel like he is not. This tells kids to be careful when searching for the solution to their problems. On top of that there is the theme of ohana. Ohana is Hawaiin for family. Lilo says that family means that nobody gets left behind or forgotten. The use of this theme brings my to tears.
The writing is excellent, the characters are great, the animation is spectacular, and the messages for kids are delivered perfectly. Lilo & Stitch is a rare movie that is as close to perfect entertainment and rightfully deserves my seal of approval.",1463875200,3,2005,4.421621621621622

I honestly don't even review Disney or Pixar movies because almost every time it would just be the same 5 star awesomeness over and over :-)  Perhaps its unfair to then compare to its siblings as the bar is normally set too high.

Watch this and expect singing mice and you are bound to be disappointed. Watch this looking for the humanity or worth in everyone and you'll say AAAAHHHHHHH.

No singing mice, few pretty outfits, only a hint of romance, weird little damaged protagonist, a jumble of stories going on at once, real and painful results from catastrophe after catastrophe before a satisfying ending: it's really a Miyazaki movie set to Elvis music.

I have some trouble with how real the sorrow is--the older sister getting more and more desperate to take care of her sister, and the realistic battles between them, but it is so well done.

Great movie, just don't watch it expecting all sunshine.",1426464000,2,855,4.68

However, this film has a very fresh and different look to it which really captivates the viewer in a peculiar sort of way. Its low-key approach and the methodical movement of its characters interspersed with moments of bizarre humor are great fun and entertainment that keeps you interested throughout. The background artwork is reminiscent of early animated cartoons while the characters are drawn with great simplicity yet yield great depth and emotion. This is a really different looking film from Disney and demonstrates that they are still capable of great innovation. LILO & STITCH is not a flamboyant film but instead it is one that you will savor.

I was skeptical of this movie until I watched it.  It's a hoot.  The relationship between the two sisters is fun and frantic.  I appreciated Lilo's outlook.  Loved her use of `practical voodoo.'  ""My friends need to be punished.""  The only character that makes me wince is Mertle.  Otherwise, it's an adorable sci-fi flick with not a few life lessons (the main one being what constitutes a family).  The animation is fresh (watercolor backgrounds that are stunningly simple).  I like that it takes place in space and Hawaii.  There's enough excitement and humor to spare.  In spite of all the monsters, it's a very warm and fuzzy film.  Beyond cute.

81136,5,0788832182,"Lilo & Stitch should manage to steal a place in your heart within minutes. And I don't mean ""steal"" in a vicious way, since none of the two is vicious at all. Much more so, they are little angels. Imperfect little angels, to be exact.

I love how the story focuses on imperfection. Lilo is a little Hawaiian girl who lost her parents, has no friends, and struggles with her tendency to throw temper tantrums when things become too much for her to handle. Then, there comes Stitch. An alien - actually an experiment created by another alien - from a faraway planet. Stitch was created to be a ruthless little monster, a machine with no remorse, willing to fight anything and anyone without batting an eyelash. Something goes wrong, and on one fateful day, Stitch lands on Hawaii where he is mistaken for a dog. Some crazy, blue, mutated type of dog. When Lilo's older sister, who takes care of her, allows her to have a pet, Lilo chooses no other 'dog' but Stitch to be her special friend. And for some reason, both of them are able to give each other what they need the most. To love and be loved, and to let the good win over the bad inside of them. The importance of feeling close and connected to somebody becomes evident. Whether that being is an actual relative or not, he or she will be family to you, or - as they call it - ""ohana"". The movie shows that there is something good inside of anybody, and that love has the ability to awaken it.

Lilo & Stitch might not be your typical Disney characters. There's a lot of trouble ahead, many emotions to be dealt with. And at the same time, it teaches us that perfection is unrealistic and downright boring compared to what Lilo & Stitch have to offer. More often than not, it is the imperfections that make a person loveable, as we can relate to their struggles, watching how they try to succeed. And whether they manage to improve themselves and their situation or not, we feel for them. It seems that, in the end, they are able to touch us much more than somebody could who never had a reason to get better in the first place.

Now, this sounded all very heart-wrenching. And I can tell you that it is. However, the movie also dwells on an excellent humor, with Lilo's cheeky, refreshingly different ways in the lead. Cheeky but never platitudinous, and never unoriginal. To be honest, I find Lilo the most adorable character (or let's say, the most adorable human character, as Stitch is gorgeous as well) ever brought to life by Disney, and I'm a huge Disney fan. I highly recommend the movie to anybody who a) loves Disney, and b) yearns for the unconventional. With Lilo & Stitch, you get adorable Disney charm and unconventional cuteness all in one.",1403913600,,2710,4.47070707070707
81137,5,0788832182,"One of my favorite movies. Streams just fine. All thumbs up. Story if you haven't seen it is about a girl and an alien, and both overcoming some internal conflicts.

81138,5,0788832182,So glad I finally have this movie on dvd! It's one of my favorite Disney movies of all times! So happy when it came in,1401926400,,118,3.76
81139,5,0788832182,"There are many who complain that Disney's 2D animated films hit a slump during the early 2000s, and I'm inclined to agree with them.  Somehow the animated feature films they had once been so famous for began to slide in quality, with few true classics and quite a few bombs being made during this time period.  Some of these films have since been vindicated by history and become cult classics, such as ""Treasure Planet,"" but others, like ""Home On the Range,"" have faded into semi-obscurity, and even Disney doesn't overly market these films and seems largely content to forget they happened.  Thankfully, despite this slump, there remain a few animated features that managed to rise above the lackluster slew of films and still manage to shine.

""Lilo and Stitch"" is one of these films.  It takes a tired concept -- an alien landing on our world and trying to fit in -- and breathes new life into it, with colorful animation, a great cast of characters, and a story that's both heart-wrenching and heartwarming.

In the far reaches of space, the council of the United Galactic Federation has declared Experiment 626, an artificial life form created by a mad scientist, a menace to society and arranges his exile to an asteroid prison.  626, however, manages to escape and finds his way to the Hawaiian islands of Earth, where he's mistaken for a dog and taken to an animal shelter.  Lilo, an eccentric young girl being raised by her harried older sister Nani, immediately falls in love with him, adopts him, and dubs him ""Stitch.""  At first Stitch is a destructive and angry force, wreaking havoc in Lilo's home, but Lilo is persistent and does her best to reform him with love, kindness, and plenty of Elvis songs.  When the UGF comes to Earth to recapture Stitch -- and a social worker threatens to separate Nani and Lilo -- Stitch's newfound loyalty to Lilo will be put to the test.

This could have been a tired entry in the ""alien lands on Earth and befriends a human"" film, but it's made enjoyable by a unique cast and location.  Instead of being set in Everyville, USA, it takes place in a small town in Hawaii, and takes full advantage of its setting.  The beauty of the islands -- and the poverty and class divisions that affect their inhabitants -- helps add some realism and flavor to the film, and the unique art style helps it further stand out and catch the viewer's attention.  The alien and starship designs are especially creative, many of them bringing to mind tropical fish or sea life.

The characters are a fun bunch as well.  Lilo is an eccentric young child with a somewhat macabre sense of humor, while her older sister Nani, while stressed at finding herself suddenly becoming a parent to her younger sister, has her own sense of snark and is able to handle Lilo's oddities with wit and humor.  Stitch starts out a destructive sociopath, but develops a sense of empathy and a longing for family as the film progresses.  Punjaab and Pleakley, the alien agents pursuing Stitch, provide a sort of ""odd couple"" humor to the film as they butt heads while searching for the runaway experiment, and Cobra Bubbles, the menacing social worker who keeps a hawk's eye on Lilo and Nani, is shown to have a heart beneath his intimidating exterior.

Like most Disney families, this one carries a message, and it's a strong, much-needed one -- the importance of family, whether its a traditional family or a decidedly untraditional but still loving unit.  The Hawaiian term ""ohana"" comes into play, and is one of the parts of the movie that's stuck with audiences everywhere.

While not as famous as, say, ""The Lion King,"" ""Lilo and Stitch"" is still a fun and heartfelt entry into the Disney animated canon, and deserves more attention than it tends to get.  A great family film, though probably best for children 8 and up due to some scenes of action violence and family drama.",1401926400,,3889,4.688235294117647

It is hilarious, sweet, sad, brutally honest about grief and families in a way that you rarely see in kid's movies in general and Disney in particular.  That plus the *far* more realistically drawn people, the beautiful music and art, and the characters you fall in love with, makes this the best Disney movie period, and good enough to stand up to ""Wall-E,"" ""Up,"" ""Monster's Inc.,"" and ""Toy Story.""

81237,5,0788832182,"So good!!!! This movie was great for several reasons. Firstly, it's honesty was refreshing and emotionally compelling. Lilo & Stitch is actually honest about the real world and the difficulties we face. It shows the challenge in family life, how losing your parents really does affect you, and family has a greater value than anything else in the world. That in itself made watching this movie an emotional journey for me. It teaches you that you can always make new friends, even in unlikely places. Heck, it shows that you can be friends with anyone, even evil genius aliens!! I think it's one of the best Disney movies ever made because of this. It also has one of the most original storylines ever. I don't think I even need to go into detail about that. Seriously, watch the movie.",1383350400,,786,4.661870503597123

81277,1,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch are just about the dumbest names I have ever heard, and the film represents those stupid names! I personally hate this movie, it's just so stupid! I think it's on par with ""The Fox and the Hound"" and ""Tarzan"" as one of my least favorite Disney films! The story is too obvious, I know it's going to be a friendship story regarding an outcast and a monster creature. I do not like the idea of Disney doing an outer space movie (although ""Treasure Planet"" is okay because it is a fairly ok adaptation), but the way they tell it in THIS is just stupid! All the people in this film look designed like puppet creatures; the eyes, the arms, and the legs! Lilo's voice is annoying and her character is too predictable, and like I said, her human puppet design. Stitch is even more annoying! His design is stupid, his voice is irritating, and his actions are just crazy! This is another one of those movies where there isn't a real traditional villain, and one that I would not let slide! Jumba seems like the villain, then he reforms... and the villain seems to be Gantu... yet he's only doing it because it's his job...then Jumba reforms, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING! I will admit ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""Finding Nemo"" don't have a traditional main villain either, but there are too many things I like about those films that I can let it slide. THIS film is nothing of the sort. The only thing that's kind of entertaining about this film is Pleakley, the funny green alien but he is not enough to save the film! I could barely find anything about this film to like. It's one of those overdone Disney films that made me lose interest in Disney for a little while, or at least the hand drawn classics. In my opinion, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is definetly a skip!",1377475200,,1756,4.422839506172839

81350,5,0788832182,"For anyone who was between 8 and 14 for the movie's 2002 release, I probably don't need to convince you it's a great film.  If you're a little older and remember The Little Mermaid and other traditionally-rendered films fondly, I think you'll take the film for its art style alone.  Watercolor backgrounds and some great character art direction make for a really watchable and colorful film, not to mention the fluid and sometimes manic motion seen in Stitch and the other alien characters.

If you'd like a really short review, please read the final paragraph of this review.  If you'd like to read a little more about how the movie might be taken, keep on reading.

But it's not just a bauble. The plot sees a colorful and funny cast of aliens interacting with a struggling pair of sisters living on Hawaii's Kauai island, just as DCFS asks pointedly if younger sister Lilo is better off living with older sister Nani.  The arrival of Stitch (an alien genetic experiment gone awry) throws everything into chaos for them both, including some pretty great scenes when Nani tries desperately to find a new job only to have Lilo and Stitch ruin her chances accidentally.  It's the best use of a montage I've seen in a long, long time and gives some good laughs along the way.

The A plot revolves around a family dynamic which incorporating Stitch by degrees and Nani's struggle to keep Lilo in her life.  The B plot is the alien federation's attempts to secure Stitch (""Experiment 626"") and put him in exile.  The final act marries the A plot and B plot well, and it finishes on a high note.  Not typical 'Disney pie in the sky, everything's good forever' stuff, but Lilo and Nani have a chance at a better life.

There are some moments that are pretty painful for an older teen or adult to watch, particularly one scene where it becomes clear Lilo should be placed in foster care, and for some Nani's struggles strike close to home. It's not framed the way most Disney films approach ""broken"" families - both Lilo and Nani need each other, but they're both ill-equipped to support each other.  That's not exactly fixed by magic wand at the culmination of the movie, but the new house and a wider support network (including two exiled scientists from Stitch's federation of planets) suggest things might get easier.

Most kids will focus on Stitch - I mean his name is in the title!  Trying to cope with his ""genetic programming"" and unable to act on his aggression, he comes to terms with not currently having a ""family"" as a spliced clone.  He comes to make his own extended family with Lilo, Nani, and a few secondary characters.  In the end he's a hero for saving Lilo from a kidnapping by an overzealous space captain out for Stitch's bounty, and Stitch remains happily exiled on Earth with his new family or ""ohana.""  There's plenty of funny ""bad boy"" behavior and trickery by Stitch, and kids and adults alike will enjoy the action scenes.  As violence goes it's bloodless but dynamic, fun, with huge sweeping motions and rolling fight scenes.

If it's a rainy afternoon and you have some kids over, pop some popcorn and watch this.  Be prepared for a few ""pew pew pew"" sound effects and giggles every time Stitch scurries on six (yes, six) limbs. If not, there's nothing to stop you from enjoying a well-animated movie about family and aliens that doesn't pluck at the same heartstring over and over again.  It knows its marks, it makes it, but it's not cloying, and its execution in animation and plot are both pretty neat.",1370649600,2,3531,4.634028892455858

Best of all it holds that families that are little and ""broken"" (dead parents because it's a Disney movie so parents need to be dead of course) can also be ""still good.""

In addition, it was a little sad like Charlie Brown, no one likes Lilo, the other girls alienate her and she's lonely, but unlike being a wimp like Chuck, Lilo would get into fights.

The movie started out on a violent note with Lilo slapping another girl silly and continued with Lilo and Stitch being chased and fired upon by laser guns. But I think constant threat of Lilo being taken away is what really bothered my daughter. I honestly didn't remember it being so fraught.

So when I took my kids on their inaugural trip to Disney World (my 30th trip), I thought it was funny that my 3 year old daughter really liked the character of Stitch after he stole my water bottle from me in Tomorrowland.

So we get home, I rent Lilo and Stitch, and we turned it off after the first 20 minutes. Why? 1) Turns out my daughter didn't care for the movie, which is saying something since she's memorized practically every other animated feature. 2) I was horrified by what it was teaching kids. Examples from the first 20 minutes:

1) Stitch spitting in people's faces;
2) Stitch bites a guy;
3) Lilo jumps a girl who says ""that's crazy"" to something she's said, starts punching her in the face, and bites her;
4) Lilo disobeys her guardian-sister and doesn't meet her where she's supposed to in order to have an important meeting with a social worker;
5) In running home to meet Lilo, her sister darts across a street without looking, then calls the driver who almost hits her a ""stupid-head"";
6) Lilo nails shut the front door to keep her sister out, then uses the stove (allowing pots to boil over since she's only around 7);
7) Her sister threatens extreme bodily harm when she won't open the door;
8) Lilo hides from her sister in the dryer.

With that, we turned it off. That was just the highlights from the first 20 minutes. Certainly not what I want to teach my daughter, even if she was 10.

I could easily consider this a classic and should never even be forgotten.

Its's like ""Ohana"" to me (get it.)

Also i would like to add further towards the lesser things that came after this movie. They are ok, but the show in some areas ruins the series and i recently watched clips of Leroy and stitch; heavily disappointing. I think that if there is ever a possible 3rd movie, the animation and art style should go back to its original movie, unlike the second movie promised.",1355529600,,819,4.243589743589744

It's about two sisters who are trying to cope with the death of the parents and the older sister tries her very best to look after as well as be the head of the family for her little sister, so that she doesn't end up in foster care. But when the alien(Sticth) comes to earth, he makes things even more difficult, because he's trying to blend in with earth species as a dog, so that he doesn't get captured by the authorities from his planet. Also I love how the characters drawn in the movie are not as models. They are very beautiful and athletic. Hawaii has a beautiful culture.

There is minor ""potty mouth"" in a couple of places, and the sisters scream at each other...but I thought it was realistic, not poorly done.  Overall thumbs up.",1353715200,,398,4.794117647058823

Pros:  The music was lively and seemed to match the scenes (especially if you are an Elvis fan) and the Stitch character was somewhat cute (when he tapped into his sensitive side and he wasn't being destructive)

Cons:  A little too much reality for a Disney flick, the main characters lacked warmth, appeared bratty (and violent), and the beginning alien scenes seemed a little long.

I really just wanted to rent this but unfortunately had to purchase it in order to view it.

I don't recommend it.",1352160000,,577,4.553398058252427

I was frustrated that Disney hadn't released a Blu-ray format for Lilo & Stitch but I knew it could be played on their blu-ray player and it could still be viewed in the car.

81575,5,0788832182,"Ever since my very first experience (no, I did not say experiment)I decided that Lilo & Stitch were well worth seeing more of. However, my experiences have only been 50% successful so far. Why? Well, I bought a 12 dvd set from Amazon (France) after having read that it is in English. However, it turned out that that information was fraudulently wrong. Half of the discs are in English (subtitled in French) while the rest were all in French, with no subtitle for English).It did NOT make me happy to have to sit and laugh at what I was seeing, without knowing what it was that I was laughing at!!Even though I got my money refunded in full as well as being able to keep the discs, I am still stuck with something I neither wanted, nor do I fully comprehend. A very similar situation happened with LILO & STITCH READ ALONG.(Check out my opinion on that at that disc site).But, THE BIG WAVE EDITION is entirely a new ball game (so to speak (or write).This is not only in English but it is completely, thoroughly and absolutely enjoyable. BUY it, GET it, you'll LOVE it.
I find it rather obnoxious that the Disney company would want to can it. Of course, we have Stitch now in Japan, with his new female friend. Having seen so much of Stitch, Lilo and Nani (and not knowing what happened to them prior to his appearence in Japan)it is a little hard to adjust to Stitch's new friends. I see on Amazon Jp. that they have a big selection of Stitch's escapades....all made in Japan.....and, I sadly say, most probably all in the Japanese language. I have written to Amazon Jp. asking if the discs have English subtitles. NO REPLY.But, I am again visiting Japan (for the 9th time) in January. So, if they do have English versions guess who's going to come home with a suitcase full.
But, apart from those anomalies, do not refuse to buy Stitch and his friends, they are just so great to see. I like them so much.....I paid $200+ for a Stitch plush. He has pride of place on my bed.(I don't have space to sit him in my lounge room!!!!).",1337990400,,2028,4.410666666666667

Used-very good was the discription I count the overall appearenece as a whole to include the casing in which it came in. Other then that excellant movie shows how kids really are and that everybody has a need to feel wanted.

81596,2,0788832182,"There is a spunk within `Lilo and Stitch' that is undeniable.  It is semi-charming.  On the other hand, there is a spunk within `Lilo and Stitch' that is also semi-annoying.  Yes, the film is rather uneven and in that vein almost unwatchable.  It just becomes something un-enjoyable.  I know that I'm totally in the minority here (I reside there, so it doesn't really bother me) but I just couldn't choke this film down completely.  I will say that there were moments that struck me, but they weren't enough to validate actually liking this movie.  Some have noted that the films premise is original, which I find kind of baffling since the actual plot formula is the same ol' same really.  I will also say that I was really disappointed the first time I saw this film, considering the fact that the advertisements were atrociously misleading.  I vividly remember countless teaser trailers showing Stitch's character invading other Disney films and the idea of a rogue character causing chaos within Disney's classics such as `Beauty and the Beast' really struck me as fun and original.  That doesn't happen ONCE in this movie.  Shrugging aside my initial annoyance, I decided to see the film a second time and judge it solely on what the film was and not what I thought it was going to be.  I still didn't really like it.  The film is wildly uneven, with conflicting moments of tender and sincere (Lilo and her sister Nani) and force-fed ridiculousness (Stitch).  It's like two films collided and what we were left with is an utter mess.  I quite like the cartoonishy animation, because I feel like it flows with the direction taken on the film (it complements the zany quality here), but the zaniness is the film's biggest flaw and so maybe it wasn't such a good decision after all.",1316044800,2,1784,4.728155339805825

Lilo and her big sister Nani are anything but perfect. They are orphans, constantly trying to appear as if they are ""making it"" in life so a social worker doesn't separate them into foster care.
  But it's hard to act normal when a crazy little alien crash lands onto their island, is mistaken for some kind of mutant homeless dog, and Lilo adopts him from the animal shelter!

81604,5,0788832182,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have compiled a list of my top 25 and this sits at the top.  I am a grown man with kids so I watch a lot of kid's movies.  You know what, the Disney and Pixar movies are usually much better than the more adult-targeted entertainment.

Lilo & Stich has the following things going for it:
1. Humor - Almost every great movie must have this, with few exceptions.
2. Good Music - Elvis and native Hawaiian artists, plus orchestra music, wow!  I discoved Mark Keali (shortened version of his name) through this movie and own his other CD's which I enjoy very much.
3. Science Fiction - This is my favorite genre, so I love the whole alien experiment bit.  And the star cruiser's reaction to hyper drive were really interesting effects.  The dialogue and vocabularly were excellent.
4. Hawaii - I love anything and everything to do with Hawaii.  So this just sealed the deal for me.

The sound in this movie was great.  Stitch has a hard time with speech and says a bunch of Stitch-speak, like ""Naga"" for no and ""Eh"" for yes, plus all kinds of neat sounding words.  Jumba has a nice deep voice and Pleakely's voice is perfect.  You couldn't have picked better voices for all involved.

I love the series spinoff too.  The follow-on movies were definately not as good as the original, but they were direct-to-DVD and not as serious about getting a good plot, new music, etc.  I still enjoyed them and own all of them.

Stitch is a real character, and will live in my memory forever.  This movie has become a part of me and crawls through my mind in some way on a daily basis.",1287360000,3,1610,4.367003367003367

81607,5,0788832182,"I keep reading all these parents bashing this movie. They want well behaved kids and good manners in a movie. Not all children are like that! This child has had a rough, very emotional past. Her parents were killed in a car accident. It happens. She is being raised by her sister who is trying to raise Lilo but is young herself and trying to support them. I have known a lot of children back in my school days who acted outlandish like Lilo. She doesn't have any friends because she is different. She is lonely and just wants a friend but doesn't know how to behave. Yes Lilo is a brat (aren't all kids sometimes in their lives?) and yes Nani doesn't handle things well (she is the sister not the mother, me and my sister fought like that) and Stitch is destructive.(that's what he was made to be, but overcomes it) Lilo even states that ""I know that is why you wreck things and push me, because you miss your parents and cry at night. You must have dreams about them"" Then she offers him to be part of the family. Both characters feel LOST. Hence the attitude problems!
The point of the story is they all stay together and love each other. A 2-4-7-and 10 year old have all viewed this movie with me. Not one of them destroy stuff or call me ""stupid head."" They laughed at those parts but never repeated them. This movie is rated PG. I understand it is hard to explain to a child why someone is taking a child away from their home, but in the real world it happens. It always can't be rainbows and sunshine. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under 5. (Because it would be hard to explain somethings to them.)
I find this movie funny and entertaining. This family has gone through a lot but stays together and loves each other. I personally think that is a good message to give to your children ALONG with all the happy, rainbows and sunshine ones.",1279497600,3,1856,4.336206896551724

Lilo, a really cute character, seems to solve her problems through violence quite a lot in this film. It's not that we expect her to be perfect but seriously, do kids really need this? No they don't. What kind of people write this stuff? Do they have children themselves or any idea of the most basic of studies on child psychology? Something is really wrong with a society that cannot produce films appropriate for young children.

81610,4,0788832182,"""Lilo & Stitch"" is second-rate Disney (or more precisely, first-and-a half-rate), but that still makes it better than animated offerings from just about anyone else. It's a real charmer, and if you haven't seen it, by all means do so. (It's a /lot/ better than ""The Princess and the Frog"", an extremely derivative film.)

For whatever reason, two or more studios will have identical or near-identical ideas for films around the same time -- eg, ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"". Whether this is coincidence or theft isn't clear, but ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Lilo & Stitch"" are thematically identical.

I'm kidding, right? Crazy, perhaps? Crazy, maybe, but I'm not kidding.

Both Stitch and the nameless robot are war machines. Though artificial creations, they are seemingly sentient (conscious and self-aware). Both have the ability to make choices, even choices inconsistent with their intended purpose (death and destruction). Both are eventually obliged to confront the question of what sorts of choices they will make. Both make the ""correct"" choice, of course.

Of the two, I prefer ""Lilo & Stitch"". The idea of a robot -- especially one that's a killing machine -- being able to override its own programming and not only refuse to kill, but behave altruistically -- doesn't make any sense. ""The Iron Giant"" is also rather heavy-handed in presenting its point of view, whereas you'll likely miss it in ""Lilo & Stitch"" if you're not paying attention.",1271635200,,1445,5.0588235294117645

While the director commentary is great (and long overdue), the 2+ hr making-of documentary absolutely steals the show here. Gone is the overproduced retrospective fluff pieces centered around celebrity voice talent and what they thought of their characters in favor of a raw, frank expose of the creation of the film which gives unique insight into the film-making process.

You see clips from their trip to Hawaii, details on the evolution of the story, their reaction to criticism from screenings and much, much more. Most of it seems to be shot by a handheld camera and often in transit, but the fact that it was documented at all is welcome.

Then there are clips (clearly transferred VHS recordings) from chalk talks put on for the animators explaining the characters, their design and attributes. While cut and short, they really give a glimpse into the process that you can't get anywhere else. Chris Sanders' style book for the film is also a real treat.

81627,5,0788832182,"My 4-year-old just recently watched Lilo and Stitch as a rental, and when i saw this 2-disc DVD set I decided to buy it. Besides the fun movie [which I love as well], there are many bonus features here which make this DVD-set a worthwhile purchase.

The story of Lilo and Stitch actually makes for quite a refreshing change from Disney's previously princess-obsessed features [not that there is anything wrong with that, but this makes a nice change]. Set in Hawaii,the main character Lilo, is a little orphan girl with emotional issues who has a caring but frustrated older sister [who can't seem to reach out to her]. Enter an inter-galactic mutant alien who lands on Earth, hides [from two other aliens who have been commanded to get rid of him] in an animal shelter and is promptly adopted by Lilo, who names him Stitch, and the adventures begin. There are plenty of catchy island songs, fun moments and even poignant scenes that will engage and entertain viewers.

The bonus features on Disc 1:
- feature-length audio commentary by the film's directors, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois
- ""Your Ohana"" music video featuring the Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus set to clips from the film.
- Lilo and Stitch Island Adventure Games, i.e. ""Gecko Race"", ""Hamsterviel's Coconut Shell Game"", and ""Hamsterviel's Match Game""
- ""Disneypedia: Hawaii - The Islands of Aloha"" which is an educational journey narrated by Lilo and Nani about the state of Hawaii and its six biggest islands with footage of volcanoes, luaus etc.
- ""Create Your Own Alien Experiment Game"" where one can guess which order three substances should be mixed in to randomly produce an experiment.
- ""A Stitch In Time:Follow Stitch Through The Disney Years"" where Stitch is creatively interwoven into other Disney classics through the years.
- ""Hula Lesson"", all about the Hawaiian dance form.
-""Burning Love"" - Behind the Scenes With Wynonna
- A-Teens'  cover of Elvis' ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You""
- ""Animating The Hula""
- 4 theatrical teaser trailers. i.e. ""Inter-Stitch-ials"" which introduce Stitch through other Disney features like ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", ""The Little Mermaid"", and ""Lion King""

The bonus features on Disc 2:

- one of the more substantial features on Disc 2 is the approx. 2 hr-long making-of documentary, featuring insightful interviews with the people behind the animated feature. Some of the prominent creators interviewed are Chris Sanders, Dean DeBlois, Clark Spencer etc. The documentary is not only lengthy, but detailed as well, and is definitely geared more to adults than little ones.

81628,5,0788832182,"Kind of nice to have a Disney release about a little girl who isn't a princess, and an adorable little critter who is actually a genetically mutated space alien, as well as being an escapee from an intergalactic weapons laboratory.  It makes an interesting and charming change, all things considered. Stitch has teeth, and claws, the ability to morph into the appearance of a puppy and an uncanny ability to sing like Elvis Presley. Lilo is a chubby little chunk of a girl, an unhappy and resentful orphan who lives with her older sister Nani. But they live on the beach in Hawaii, trying to keep up some kind of family life after the deaths of their parents - a little pool of misery in a tropical paradise. Nani's custody of her little sister is threatened by a supremely intimidating child welfare caseworker - and thinking that a pet might help, they go to the animal shelter. Stitch is hiding there, having scared the living daylights out of all the other dogs. It turns out to be a perfect match - a pair of lonely, unhappy nonconformists, although Lilo is blissfully innocent of exactly how much of a nonconformist  that her apparent pet really is.

As with all recent Disney re-releases, the video extras on this set are generous - but somewhat confusingly organized, along the lines of ""hey, boys and girls, let's throw everything into this and hope that most of it sticks!"" The longest is a two-hour long ""making of"" documentary, which succeeds in being amazingly detailed and very interesting - I did not know that there was entire climactic sequence, of Stitch flying a 747 through a city which was omitted completely. (This movie had been in production at the time of 9-11) There are some games aimed at the younger set, a disappointingly short hula demo and lesson, and a short and mildly amusing short ""A Stitch in Time,"" inserting Stitch into a whole series of classic Disney movies. I have to note that the audio of the movie itself is amazing - even on an ordinary television it sounds nearly as good as in a theater. What it sounds like on a high-end home-theater setup must be nothing short of miraculous.",1241308800,,2125,4.6462765957446805
81629,5,0788832182,"When LILO & STITCH first premiered on DVD, there was quite a bit of bonus material already, but this new ""Big Wave"" 2-disc edition really does pay off the package claim that there are more than two hours' worth.

Much of that time is taken up by the feature-length documentary that literally follows the creative team, particularly writer/directors Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois, from initial concepts to a glamorous premiere at Cannes (where, by the way, we get to enjoy a continental breakfast with Chris Sanders as he brings his bakery products to life on the tray).

It also contains the original climactic scene in which Stitch wildly pilots a 747 through the city. This seemed completely out of the realm of reality at the time to the filmmakers, but then 911 happened and it was totally changed. (I was working on the graphic novel version at the time and was sent a new script in order to change it, too.)

Making an animated film is not all sunshine and talking muffins, though. Sanders and Deblois are also seen in the midst of a disagreement, capturing a moment that does not appear to be staged. A lot of what the two explain on the audio commentary is also supplemented with the generous supply of deleted scenes on the discs.

One of the most interesting comments the filmmakers share is that they consulted with someone at Pixar who suggested a very pivotal plot point with the ""Ugly Duckling"" book. This was before the Disney*Pixar merger but clearly Pixar's influence was felt. In fact, Lilo & Stitch may be one of the most Pixar-like of the Eisner era Disney films because it has a very odd storyline. Perhaps this was because it was made in Florida, 3,000 miles away from day to day ""input,"" just as Pixar remains six hours away.

The only thing that seems to have been shoehorned in the film was the teen pop song at the end, which Sanders and Deblois dart with comic sarcasm in their commentary. The music video of this song, by the A-Teens, are among the few items not repeated on this new edition. Most of them were, in part, added to the documentary feature.

Chris Sanders' presence on the bonus materials is well worth noting. He was let go from Disney after a publicly-known creative stalemate with John Lasseter about AMERICAN DOG, which was reassigned and renamed BOLT and ironically released at the same time as this edition. But it speaks highly of Lasseter's integrity and character as a human being, as well as a person who cares about Disney, that Sanders' important role in Disney history was not obscured or removed because of ego or corporate complication.

It would it be terribly wrong to eliminate the contributions and commentary of anyone who has made a contribution to the Disney organization and history and even more heinous if they were attributed to someone else. Committing such an act would be a disservice to Disney and the people who are part of its heritage, be it past or present. It would be like saying Ward Kimball animated STEAMBOAT WILLIE because Ub Iwerks left the Company. This would reflect poorly on  professionalism, ethics and respect for the contributions of Disney people, past and present (remember Walt's quote about people?).

To the immense credit of everyone connected with this edition of LILO AND STITCH, such a tremendous, unconscionable act did not occur in this particular instance. It's a fine new DVD release, which truly delivers a lot of new material and lives up to its claim of ""much, much more.""",1238630400,5,3479,4.746688741721854
81630,3,0788832182,"On March 24th Disney released Lilo & Stitch in a two disc ""Big Wave"" edition.  This eighty-five minute animated film was a huge success when it was released in June of 2002, and is still an interesting and visually exciting film, but this new release appears to be, well, stitched together.

Lilo & Stitch take the ET formula and turns it upside down as the aggressive and nearly indestructible genetic experiment 626 escapes his prison sentence, makes his way to Earth, and is adopted by the also aggressive Lilo, who loves her unusual looking dog.  Take the antics of the two main characters, throw in Lilos over extended guardian and older sister Nani, a mysteriously stern man in black social worker named Cobra Bubbles, and an alien comedy team sent to capture Stitch, put them all in the serene Hawaiian islands, and set all the action to some classic Elvis songs, and you have a film that children are sure to enjoy.

The film has some unusually violent tendencies for a Disney film, as Lilo is certainly not the standard Disney youngster.  She hits, bites, and talks back, but the film is about growth and change as both characters display a well crafted evolution in who they are and how they relate to their environment and those in it.  There are some good messages to be found in this film, though parents may need to break it down for children, as the story is a bit busy.

The vocal talents of Daveigh Chase and Tia Carrere, as Lilo and Nani do a wonderful job of capturing the local dialect, as does Jason Scott Lee as the local boy interested in Nani.  Writer and co-director Chris Sanders has fun with the sounds emanating from Stitch, and David Ogden Stiers, Ving Rhames, Kevin McDonald, and Kevin Michael Richardson round out a talented cast of vocal artists who bring great energy to this project.

It is the look and sound of the film that will endear it to adults.  The watercolors give this film a look that seems to combine the beauty of classic Disney animation with the technology of today to create images that jump of the screen and settings that draw the viewer in.  The imagery is truly some of the best in the Disney vault, and it is hard to go wrong with a sound track full of Elvis songs.  The entire soundtrack is worth owning as it contains great rock and roll along with wonderful songs that are sure to transport you to the islands.

It's almost seven years since the film hit the big screen and eventual DVD release, an animated television series would follow the next year, and a straight to DVD sequel in 2005, so it had to be time for a new release.  Disney certainly had enough time to put together something really special, so why does the two disc ""Big Wave"" edition seem so thrown together?  From no information as to which pieces of material are on which disc, to repetitive content, games listed as samples that aren't, a ridiculously short hula lesson, and a painfully long documentary, this is a mess.

The reselling of a film on DVD is always about the bonus material, and there is certainly a lot here, but how about putting some effort into the presentation.  The second disk is an embarrassment.  It loads to an amateurish menu that leads to a documentary which follows the making of the film from inception to premiere, and is exhaustively thorough at over two hours.  If that is not enough, the second disk also includes footnotes from the documentary, and deleted scenes and early versions, though both features contain a lot of the same material.

The first disk contains the feature as well some pleasant and educational bonus features including audio commentary featuring producer Clark Spencer and directors/writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, DisneyPedia: Hawaii - The Islands of Aloha, and the theatrical trailers that creatively inserted Stitch into classic Disney films such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and Aladdin.

Where as the documentary on the second disk was too long, some features on the first disc are far too short.  The Hula lesson will disappoint kids as it could have easily been a terrific piece by providing some quality instruction rather than the three minute glance that it is, ""Burning Love"" is nothing more than watching Wynonna standing in front of a microphone singing the song, and though ""A Stitch in Time"" is certainly long enough at three minutes, it makes little sense.

Recommendation: If you don't own the wonderfully edgy Lilo & Stitch, than this is a fine way to add it to your collection. If you do already own the DVD, and really want to know more about the film, there is some quality bonus material here, but the presentation certainly could have been better as could some of the content.",1238544000,8,4723,4.677536231884058
81631,5,0788832182,"I was reluctant to buy this since I already own Lilo & Stitch on DVD and the posted special features didn't look all that different from the previous DVD release. But since this is one of my favorite Disney films I went and got it anyway.

I'm so glad I decided to buy this.

The biggest thing missing on the other DVD release was a commentary and I was legitimately surprised to find one here after Chris Sanders' recent turmoil with Disney.

The entire second disc is a documentary on the making of the film. Whereas most ""making of"" featurettes for animated films last about 10 minutes and focus on the voice talent, this one is 2 hours long (more than 30 minutes longer than the actual film) and covers almost every step of the production you could think of. From the origins of the story, though major plot changes, on down to playing with the Happy Meal toys.

Even better than the actual documentary are the ""footnotes,"" clips that support the main piece. These include earlier versions of scenes, drawing sessions with the lead animators, and interviews with animation legends Joe Grant & Maurice Noble. My personal favorite is the production style guide that defines basic rules of the Lilo & Stitch look.

This is right up there with Disney's 2 disc version of Atlantis for the sheer amount of extras. If you're an animation fan, you have to get this.",1238025600,,1361,4.607438016528926
81632,5,0788832182,"The 42nd animated film in the Disney library, ""Lilo & Stitch"" is a very unique film. Slightly darker than what you would expect, dealing with some adult issues, it strays from the typical upbeat love story that you'd expect with princesses and fairies. The story is about an artificial alien, Stitch, created illegally by Dr. Jumba Jookiba (voice of David Ogden Stiers). Programmed to be aggressive and destructive, Stitch is banished to an asteroid. He escapes his captors, stealing a vehicle and heads to Earth. Jumba is sent by the Grand Councilwoman to quietly retrieve him in exchange for Jumba's pardon.

Stitch is mistaken for a dog and put in a Hawaiian animal rescue shelter. Meanwhile, Lilo (Daveigh Chase) is a little girl living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) since their parents were recently killed in a car accident. Nani is struggling with keeping a job and tending to Lilo, who is not much different from Stitch: unable to make friends and lonely, Lilo is also full of uncontrolled and explosive anger. Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), an intimidating social worker who looks more like an agent from ""Men in Black,"" warns Nani that she is in danger of losing Lilo if she is not able to get the situation under control. Attempting to get Lilo a pet for companionship, Nani takes Lilo to the shelter. Lilo immediately falls for Stitch, who is on his best behavior so that he can escape Jumba.

Stitch's destructive outbursts cause more trouble for Nani, but along the way, through the unconditional love of Lilo, he learns the importance of family. More aliens arrive to capture Stitch, and Lilo must save Stitch while at the same time keep Nani out of trouble from Cobra Bubbles. Exciting chase sequences follow as all of the parties attempt to achieve their missions.

The plot may sound a little convoluted, but on film, it definitely isn't. It is full of touching moments; Lilo is obviously hurting from the loss of her parents, and the fact that she is an outcast amongst her peers doesn't help. Stitch, although thoroughly nasty, does show traces of sadness and emotion, especially when he realizes that he doesn't have a family or any history due to the way that he was created. Through Lilo, Stitch is able to have the love and acceptance that he wants. This becomes known to the audience through Lilo's mantra of ""Nobody gets left behind.""

The task for making this movie was to create something in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dumbo-Big-Top-Edition/dp/B000EYK4GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dumbo (Big Top Edition)</a>; a memorable yet simple classic that could be made within a more modest budget. It definitely succeeds. I will caution that for younger children, there is some slightly disturbing material, dealing with the loss of parents and some anger expressed between the 2 sisters. The initial sequences with Stitch on the alien ship can also be a little unsettling as they basically discuss his destruction and remove samples of his fluids. There are a number of violent and destructive parts, dealing with both Lilo & Stitch. With a little adult supervision and explanation, this film quickly steers towards more pleasant territory and can be a great shared family experience. The rich colors of the movie and the watercolor backgrounds really add to the visual experience and captures the beauty of Hawaii.

This 2-disc set is a whopper when it comes to extras.

Disc One:

* Audio Commentary: Featuring Producer Clark Spencer and Directors/Writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois.

* ""Your Ohana"" Music Video: features clips from the movie

* Lilo & Stitch Island Adventures Games: 3 different games--Gecko Race, Hamsterviel's Coconut Shell Game, and Hamsterviel's Experiment Match Game. None are really very challenging, and are most likely designed for the younger set.

* Disney Pedia: Hawaii--The Islands of Aloha. Learn about all the islands of Hawaii through film clips and narration--Big Island of Hawaii, Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Lana'i, Moloka'i. A nice little feature that does a great job of summarizing the history and culture of Hawaii.

* Create Your Own Alien Experiment Game

* A Stitch in Time: Follow Stitch Through the Disney Years (3:31)--Disney history is re-written as Stitch is placed into Disney classics of the past, beginning with ""Snow White."" Mildly amusing.

* Hula Lesson (3:36)--Hula Consultant and Hawaiian Music Composer Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu shows the 4 basic steps of the hula and describes the famous dance as a dance of the heart & the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.

* Burning Love: Behind the Scenes with Wynonna (1:31). Vocal powerhouse Wynonna Judd sings this famous Elvis tune for the end of the film. Chris Sanders calls her the female Elvis. Wynonna fondly discusses Elvis, and how he was authentic in his art.

* Can't Help Falling In Love (1:01): Music video performed by A-Teens. Montage of clips from the movie and the teen group singing/peforming this song.

* Animating the Hula (3:04): Directors/Writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois wanted to be respectful & accurate in their depiction of this famous dance. They filmed one day of hula dancing at Mark's studio, using this footage as the basis for the dances in the film. However, none of this material was used for tracing/rotoscoping; it was only used as a visual guide. Side-by-side live action/animation is great to watch.

* Inter-Stitch-ials: Theatrical Trailer Teasers-- Stitch is inserted into trailers from other Disney classics (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Lion King) to promote his own movie. After Stitch crashes the Beauty & The Beast ballroom sequence, Belle exclaims to him ""Get your own movie!"" Again, mildly amusing.

Disc 2:

The initial menu is deceiving; it would appear that the only extras are a documentary and deleted scenes; the section marked ""footnotes"" is loaded with many other extras, so be sure to click on that button as well.

* Documentary (2:06)--A very thorough documentary about the creation of this movie, heavily focusing on Directors/Writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois. They both counterbalanced each other; Dean was more focused, and Chris was more off the cuff and energetic. Their differences are apparent in the cross-cut interview clips here. Roy Disney describes the task of creating another ""Dumbo,"" as he says ""It's ok to look under rocks for small stories."" VERY enjoyable behind-the-scenes documentary that is revelatory in showing the happy changes that occur through the creative process.

* Deleted Scenes & Early Versions: mix of finished animation, pencil animation, and storyboards. Deleted Scenes--Stitch's Trial, Gantu's Challenge, Untimely Death of Pudge the Fish, Bedtime Story, and The 747 Sequence. Early Versions: Model Citizen--Mayhem on the Beach, Jumba Attacks, and The 747 Sequence with Stitch's Gang.

Documentary Footnotes: Featuring elements that flesh out the documentary; some are seen elsewhere on the 2 discs.

* Mulan: Mulan's Decision (clip from the movie)
* Walking is Falling: Joe Grant in conversation with Dean DuBlois. Disney legend Joe Grant shows his portfolio and more in this 10:41 featurette.
* Chris' Pitch Book: Abridged version of Chris' 1998 pitch book. Some scenes translated directly to the finished product, some were significantly altered. Interesting to see.
* Chris' Photo Gallery
* Treatise on Stitch: Silly little fluff on Stitch's specs.
* Deleted Scenes: Stitch's Trial & Untimely Death of Pudge the Fish
* Andreas Deja's Sketches of Lilo
* Early Version: Model Citizen
* Fishing with Ric (9:15). Follow art director Ric Sluiter, the man responsible for watercolors coming to fruition on this project, as he takes a fishing expedition and discusses the film.
* Ric Sluiter interviews Maurice Noble (10:46). 1999 archival footage of fine artist Maurice Noble who began his Disney career painting a wormy apple for ""Snow White"" (1937). Discusses the technique of creating watercolor paintings.
* Dumbo: The Train Arrives. Sequence from film.
* Chalk Talk: Alex Kupershmidt on Stitch (8:38). Oct. 1999 footage of Stitch's Supervising Animator drawing Stitch before a live audience and discussing the how, why, and what...with his initial disclaimer that this is all theoretical!
* Chalk Talk: Andreas Deja on Lilo (9:36). Sept. 2000 footage of Lilo's Supervising Animator drawing Lilo before a live audience and discussing the how, why, and what.
* The Sanders Style Book (9:50): View the book used as a guide for drawing the characters in the movie; previous Disney characters are also shown for comparison's sake. Fantastic for budding artists/animators!
* Dean Pitches New Sequence. Early version of ""Dysfunctional Angel"" (3:06). See Dean run through the storyboards and describe the scene.
* 2 Deleted Scenes: Gantu's Challenge & Bedtime Story
* 2 Early Versions: Jumba Attacks & 747 Sequence with Stitch's Gang
* Deleted Scene: 747 Sequence
* Lilo & Stitch Teasers: Lion King, Little Mermaid, Beauty & The Beast, and Aladdin

SPECS:

Video: 1.66:1 (Enhanced for 16x9 TVs). A visual colorfest with the lush watercolor backgrounds and simple yet effective character animation.

Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. French & Spanish language tracks and subtitles. Surprisingly, the sound really gives surround speakers a workout--very pleasing! The music of the movie sounds great as well, especially the various Elvis tributes.

This set will provide hours of entertainment between both the feature and the extras; budding artists will delight in some of the featurettes and the documentary. Add it to your collection now!",1237939200,2,9659,5.214838709677419
81633,4,0788832182,"I have grown to like the film more as time has gone by.

Good story, the Stitch character became very popular.

Beautiful animation.  Nicely designed DVD package.

Had a point to the story about family but did NOT make people sick in getting the point across.

Already the 2cd DVD release of the film.  I REMEMBER SEEING THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GOING TO RE-RELEASE IT ON DVD IN 2004.

Ok, normal, decent extras with this DVD package.  I normally enjoy the ""Making of"" segments.

But, the rest of this DVD package.  A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT DISNEY.

WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

1.  THESE HORRIBLE HAVE THE LITTLE FLIP OPEN PARTS TO GET INTO THE CASE/JEWEL BOX  Some Disney DVD's have them some do not.  HOW ABOUT NONE DISNEY?
2.  Is Disney  thinking it is 10 year ago at the beginning of DVD's?  WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THE PLAIN, SILVER DISCS?  This film has beautiful animation but yet THERE IS NOTHING ON THE DISC

I hope Disney does better in the future with the 3rd DVD release of the film.",1237939200,,987,4.468926553672317
81634,5,0788832182,"I want to clarify that the upgrade is in the second disc, the first disc is basically the same great looking 2002 release (complete with the original bonus material).
The only exception is that the Deleted Scenes have been moved over to disc 2.  Strangely, the Theatrical Promos have been copied over to disc 2 also, but they are still included on disc 1.
I believe this is essentially the intended 2004 2-Disc set that never got released, but with some updates to the 2+ hour documentary on disc 2.  Which also explains why no Blu-Ray, this is not a re-mastering of the movie.  But for regular DVD you can not complain, the movie looks great.  This also means those upgrading, like me, don't have to worry that something was changed (like the recent Piniocchio re-master) and they can get rid of their original DVD.
For the serious animation fan, disc 2 is the disc we have long been waiting for.  Upgrading to this set is a no-brainer, yes - upgrade.
But if you just like the movie & have no interest in how it was made, then the original single disc version is good enough.  There is no need to buy it again.

However, this could be one of the big marketing snafu's of Disney history.
1) In 2004 this movie was still at the height of its popularity, today it is almost forgotten.  Had this come out in 2004 it would have been a big media spash.  Sales would have been through the roof (not tomention the better economy then).
2) This 2-disc release was released the very same day as the new-to-DVD Bolt.  All eyes & promotions seem to focused on Bolt.
3) Today Blu-Ray is the way to go for serious fans & there is no Blu-Ray release of this 2-disc version.  And it is the serious fans who will upgrade for the 2+ hour documentary.

In the first day of it's 2-disc DVD release, there are only 4 reviews.  That shows how this great movie has slipped out of the consiousness of the public.",1237939200,,1889,4.378223495702006

Since 2002, the animated film has received several direct-to-video film releases and even a cartoon series.

With the original DVD release back in 2002, in 2003 a 2-disc DVD release was announced but was delayed.  Fans of the film have waited for the 2-disc version for years and the question many who own the original DVD may be asking, is this 2-disc release worth it?

If you are a big fan of the animated film, then the answer is a resounding...YES!!!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Lilo & Stitch"" is a beautiful, animated film that takes place in Hawaii.  So, this animated film definitely showcases a variety of colors of the island and the Hawaiian clothing and lush lands and beautiful beach.  Personally, I would love to see a Blu-ray Disc treatment of this film because it's a type of film that would benefit in 1080p.  But overall, the picture quality of the DVD is vibrant with colors and the animation had a distinct character designs and overall, beautiful to look at.

The video is presented with an aspect ratio of (1:66:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.

As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and also includes French and Spanish language tracks.  The audio utilizes the rear channels during the action segments and also musically, the music plays a big part in the film.  Although not a musical but a dialogue-based film, overall, ""Lilo & Stitch"" utilizes the speaker channels with the front channel showcasing the dialogue and musical tracks with the rear channels utilizing various background sounds, ambient sounds and also booms and crashes during the action scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Lilo and Stitch"" was a wonderful animated film and who can't deny the cuteness and the wit of the latest duo from Disney, Hawaiian girl Lilo and her little alien pet Stitch.  These two characters are so unlike any Disney characters with Lilo who comes from literally a broken home, her older sister Nani trying to make ends meet as the guardian of Lilo after the death of their parents and just to watch how their life has been personally affected.  Stitch is unlike any Disney character that we have seen.  He is quite mischievous and eats his snot, how crazy is that?

The character of Lilo is full of vitality but because her parents are deceased and having to stay at home while her sister works and the family not exactly having a lot of money, she wants to fit in with the other girls but it just doesn't happen that easily.

And the relationship between Lilo & Stitch was just enjoyable to watch.  Stitch brings joy into her life despite being a bit troublesome, but Lilo is somewhat similar and thus starts to grow up now that she has the responsibility of taking care of her pet.  As for Stitch, being raised to be this weapon of destruction, he learns from Lilo that being part of a family is very important and like the story of ""Ugly Duckling"", Lilo embraces him with open arms and he learns how relationships mean to him.  Love rather than destruction.

Combined with a beautiful, colorful and lush setting of Hawaii, the art and animation department did a great job capturing Hawaii all the way up to the movements of the hulu dancing.  Overall, this film was just fun to watch and it's also great to watch this film again and watching a Disney animated film that were hand drawn using CGI but a film not entirely 3D which many of the animated Disney films are of late.

When ""Lilo & Stitch"" was released into theaters, I have to admit that I was very happy because America would get a second animated film from Disney that would feature a lead and supporting character that is Asian.  ""Mulan"" was fun but it was a period film taking place during the Chinese Dynasty, ""Lilo & Stich"" on the other hand, this is an entirely different animated film with it's own style thanks to the characters and the overall setting.  This is just an enjoyably fun and entertaining film.

The documentary included on disc 2 was just amazing to watch because you literally see how directors/writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois really gave their all for this film.  It's rare to catch these lengthy documentaries in a Walt Disney DVD release and I don't think I have ever watched a documentary over 2 hours long in a DVD or Blu-ray release for an animated film.  But nevertheless, really good insight on the creative process and those who want to get involved in the animated film industry will definitely enjoy this documentary and what they can learn from it.

As for the release of the ""2-Disc Big Wave Edition"", it's literally the cherry on top of the cake.  I was just amazed by the sheer amount of special features included.  Disc 1 is pretty much packed with bonus features but to know there was more footage ala the documentary and deleted scenes on disc 2, I was impressed.  Disney definitely went all out for this release.

It's quite interesting how this 2-Disc DVD release was announced back in 2003 but finally made its way to DVD seven years later and with that being said, this is one of those films that you can only hope that Disney releases on Blu-ray because if this animated film looks and sounds good on DVD, I can imagine how awesome it would look in high definition.

All in all, there really is nothing negative I can say about this ""Lilo & Stitch: 2-Disc Big Wave Edition"" release.  It's an awesome film in which Disney went all out in making sure fans get the ultimate DVD release and this release doesn't disappoint at all.  The only thing that can be better is a high definition release but for now, this DVD release definitely gets an A+.

""Lilo & Stitch: 2-Disc Big Wave Edition"" is highly recommended!",1237766400,84,11399,4.830324909747293

However, as the film progresses, all those characters (small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring ""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message. You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the beginning.

I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie 100 percent devoid of the slightest profanity.

In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly recommended.  As soon as a Blu-Ray high-def version comes out on this movie, I'll buy it!",1236816000,,825,4.6689655172413795
81648,5,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch was a box office hit in the summer of 2002, but when it was released to DVD in the US Disney had chose to release it on a single disk. Since 2002, there's been lots of talk of a 2-disc re-release, and a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo and Stitch was released in the UK in 2005 with no mention of a US release.

Now, nearly 7 years, Three Sequels, and a TV Series Lilo & Stitch is FINALLY arriving on a 2-Disk Big Wave Edition!

Disney's website lists the special features as follows:
*Deleted Scenes
*""Your 'Ohana"" Music Video Featuring The Hawaiian Chorus
*The Story Room: An Interactive Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Making Of The Film
*Lilo & Stitch Island Adventure Games
*A Stitch In Time: Follow Stitch Through The Disney Years
*""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" Music Video Performed By A-Teens
*DisneyPedia: Hawaii -- The Islands Of Aloha: Explore The Hawaiian Islands
*And Much, Much More!

The 'Much, Much More' should include everything that's made it onto the film's internationally-available Special Editions. Most of these are left to speculation as to if they will be included or not, but it is almost guaranteed that the release will include the 'Alternate Ending' in which Stitch and the gang hijack an airliner to use in the chase at the end of the movie. That scene was cut and reanimated in light of the then recent World Trade Center attacks.

The plot of the film has been reviewed to death, but Lilo & Stitch has become one of Disney's break out films (dare I say franchise?) of the 21st century. It has spawned three sequels, and two television series (One designed specially for an anime market) so its about time this great film got the 2-disk treatment.

81649,4,0788832182,"Lilo & Stitch is one hour and fifteen minutes long and was released on June 21, 2002. Lilo & Stitch won the 2002 Artios Award for Animated Voice Over Feature and 2002 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for Music in an Animated Feature Film. This was first for Disney in a couple ways. First this was Disney first science fiction animation cartoon and second, it was the first movie to be original and not set on a story. The DVD includes: Build An Alien Experiment Game, DisneyPedia: Hawaii, A Stitch in Time, The Young Voices of Hawaii, ""Burning Love"": Behind the Scenes with Wynonna, and How-To-Hula Lesson. The movie is about an alien named Stitch who escaped from the Galactic Federation and crashed lands on Earth. Stitch wakes up in dog shelter and is adopted by Lilo. Stitch goes to live with Nani and Lilo. Nani looks to be about eighteen years old and Lilo looks to be about six or eight. Nani is the caretaker of Lilo because we found out the movie that their parents died in a car crash. Along the way Stitch seems to be adjusting to family life.

*Disneypedia: Hawaii

*(more to come)

To say that this release has been a long-time coming would be an understatement.  As a huge fan of this film, the three that followed it, and the television series, to finally see this movie given the royal treatment is a real treat.

While Disney's 2-D animated films of this decade have not exactly set the entertainment world on fire, I have enjoyed many of them very much, ""Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"", included.  This movie was the next in line after those two; it went on to gross $127 million at the box office and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

""Lilo & Stitch"" is the story of a young Hawaiian girl, Lilo, who chances upon what she thinks is an unusual-looking dog in an animal shelter.  She takes this strange creature into her home...and everything goes completely nuts.  The blue ""abomination"" (as he is called in the film) turns out to be an alien science experiment gone awry, with a renegade spirit and a hunger for distruction.

If you haven't seen this film, I won't go into many more details, because I don't want to give the movie away.  But trust me when I say this: ""Lilo & Stitch"" is one Disney animated film that is worth your time.  It is funny, touching, engaging, witty, heartfelt; you name it.

And for those of us who have seen this movie, who LOVE this film, who consider it to be one of the best things to ever come out of the House of Mouse...this two-disk set is a long-time coming.",1230681600,6,1786,4.526479750778816

The music is magnificent and very fitting to the film as most of it is Hawaiian influenced and features Hawaiian singers and instruments.

She consistently tries but can't quite get it right, thanks in no small part to Lilo herself. And just when things look the bleakest, we get a ""just kidding!"" end.

The trouble is that things got to a point where there was no other way to resolve the plot with a happy ""family stays together"" ending. It left me asking what the point of all the build-up was.

81689,5,0788832182,"I must say I thouroughly enjoyed this film. I know Disney had been treading some troubled waters with their prior releases, with several not doing what they would have hoped at the box office. This picture is a wonderful breath of fresh air. The story is fresh and highly original, and the characters are well-done, especialy Lilo, the lonely girl who adopts Stitch as her pet, not knowing he's an alien experiment gone wrong. Tia Carrera is great as her older, long-suffering sister who's struggling desperately to hold whats left of her family together. The soundtrack is a true gem, with traditional Hawaiian music alongside Elvis Presley classics. A little Hawaiian girl who adores Elvis! Fantastic! Anyway, there is a wonderful moral of family to this film, which gives it heart, something not many films these days have. Moving, funny, and with something the whole family can watch and enjoy, Lilo & Stitch is possibly the best film to come out of Disney for a long time. The DVD transfer is excellent, the colors just are vibrant and glow, like watercolor paintings. The sound is wonderful and clear, and the bonus features are well worth checking out as well, especially the Stitch In Time feature. Priceless! Anyway, get and enjoy this fine film.",1155427200,3,1255,4.896713615023474

81691,5,0788832182,"I felt that Disney pretty much became like the Lost Boys this decade as alot of their fare in movies have not been traditional Disney. There's been alot of milking characters for what they're worth, and original ideas that have either fizzled out too quickly, or completely misfired altogether. This one pretty much had the originality, and good storyline. It talked about families, and what they actually are looking like these days where the traditional mom and dad are M.I.A., and Lilo is raised by her older sister as both parents are dead, and then along comes an Alien to turn thier lives upside down; how more original do you want than that? Anyway it has the storyline, and the characters, and for the most part a good soundtrack except for one, and I want to go on record that I enjoy Elvis don't get me wrong, but I've outgrown:"" You're The Devil In Disguise"".I enjoyed it for a very short time when I was 11, but the honeymoon is over. The song doesn't do a thing for me, and if it does it's sheer depression. The southern gospel beat the key of F, and the lyrics they all have to go. I know when watching this for the first time in the theaters it was about as bad as a rusty nail being dragged across a blackboard. I felt like crying.

81693,5,0788832182,"Disney began to experiment with their animated films in the early 2000s, shying from the traditional musicals and picking projects which were offbeat. Lilo and Stitch was probably their biggest success (followed closely by Emperor's New Groove). It's a film about the meaning of family and acceptance, set in beautiful Hawaii with two very offbeat leads: a monster with a violent streak and a kid that doesn't fit the 'barbie' mode of previous leads. They have great chemistry, and it's so fun watching them in action that Disney eventually did some decent sequels and a tv series.

At this point I keep hearing rumours of a 2-disc Lilo and Stitch edition, not sure if it's coming or when. It's been released in other regions, and among other things contains the original plane sequence that was altered after the 9/11 tragedy. If you're looking for something for the kids this single disc already has good audio/video and some nice bonuses, but animation buffs should keep their eyes out to see if the 2-disc will be announced soon.

I was in Disney World last year. I have to admit I was a naysayer. I couldn't understand what all these little kids were obsessing about. Stitch was the most popular character there. He was even my wake-up call every morning. However, after seeing this film, now I know what the fuss is about. This film is great for all ages and ranks among the best in the Disney franchise.

What's to love in this movie? Are people so hard up for something to do they love a movie that glorifies violence and hyper-activity as beloved?  I was astonished to discover so many 5 star reviews and recommendations as a kid's movie.

With great picture, excellent sound and fairly decent amount of extras...few may have expected another dvd release but that's true. Disney had plans of releasing a very special 2disc masterpiece edition of lilo and stitch in 2005 but for some strange reasons it was delayed repeatedly and will be hitting the stores early next year.

This special edition will include complete making of the film with running time over two hours, covering each and every part of the movie. There will be lots of interviews from the animators and directors, concept art, rough animation and other stuff too. And that's just not all. Other than this long documentary, there will be a commentary track from the directors, never before seen deleted scenes, art galleries...and lots more. It will also contain all the bonus materials from this single disc release.

With a full making-of documentary and other impressive bonus features, this lilo and stitch 2disc masterpiece edition dvd is said to be the best disney dvd release ever.

If you feel a little too restless with not even its release date out yet, here's some good news. This 2disc edition has already been released in Italy and UK (region 2) and is available from amazon.co.uk at a fairly reasonable price.

It includes an alternative ending, music videos, behind the scenes, and lot's of more features. The price varies from US$17 to US$24, depending where you get it. I really like this movie, and I am planing to get the part 2 (Stich has a glitch) because includes the DTS soundtrack but I am still wondering if Disney is going to release part 1 in a 2-discs special editon, which I believe could be better than this one or probably the same. I am telling you this because the same happen with Mulan 2, which was release on October 04 in Mexico and February 05 in the USA, Tarzan 2-discs special editon which was release on May 05 in Mexico and is going to be available until october in the USA, other movies just are realease the same date like Tarzan 2, The incredibles, Bambi, and Cinderella 2-discs (on October 05). I got most of my Disney movies in the USA because I lived up there for 4 years and many through amanzon because some features are eliminated when change the language like the DTS soundtrack which is not included in MultiRegion format (1,4).

81712,5,0788832182,"When this movie came out, I asked someone from Hawaii about it and her response was that in Hawaii they have a name for a woman like Nani, someone who's always doing the wrong thing...but for the life of me I can't remember the term. I'd rather focus on the movie.

There are so many great moments in this film, and some revolutionary--for Disney--elements:

--A girl who doesn't have ""marry the hero"" as her whole character arc (although Belle comes close) and her male fixations are limited to Stitch and Elvis
--No talking animal sidekicks (although Pocahontas didn't have talking animals)
--No breaking into song, except for Elvis dance routines
--Strong matriarchs, e.g. Grand Councilwoman, Lilo, Nani
--A woman with a real figure and a Jennifer Lopez rear
--A mother-figure household without a wicked stepmother

For years with the exception of Peter Pan, Disney kills off the mothers or leaves them powerless--though Queen Sarabi's regal dignity in ""The Lion King"" is memorable. Lilo's parents are dead, but Nani is the mother figure--and not a good one at that. Nani and Lilo act bratty for half the film until the destructive Stitch explodes into their lives--but oddly leaves them better off than they were.

The one character I disliked intensely in this film (and in the series) is Mertle. She is the stereotypical awful popular girl who is rude to Lilo. True, Lilo's in need of coping skills, but one can't help but think that even the intelligent Lilo has her breaking point when subjected to Mertle's pettiness.

By contrast, Dr. Jumba, Cobra Bubbles, and the Niles Crane-like Pleakley come off as all doing their best to do their duty. While Dr. Jumba isn't repentant about his experiments, he does do his duty trying to capture 626/Stitch. Pleakley is your typical fussbudget. Captain Gantu is your career officer.

Cobra Bubbles, who we learn is X-Filesish, just does his duty by Lilo in taking a hard line with Nani. (""Thus far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience."" ""Let me illuminate you on the precarious situation you've found yourself in. I am the one they call when things go wrong, and things have indeed gone wrong."") He does soften and admit how much Nani loves Lilo. His exchange with the Grand Councilwoman at the end is hysterical!

Mr. Cobra Bubbles: [to Lilo] Aliens are all about rules.
Grand Councilwoman: You look familiar...
Mr. Cobra Bubbles: CIA. Roswell. 1973
Grand Councilwoman: Ah yes. You had hair then.

Grand Councilwoman: As caretakers of the alien lifeform, this family [Nani and Lilo] is under the protection of the United Galactic Federation. We'll be checking in from time to time.
Mr. Cobra Bubbles: I was afraid you were going to say that. This won't be easy to explain at Headquarters.

The film has both funny moments and serious ones. It is very heart-warming and (If-I-can-admit-it) it's also a mild tear-jerker. I believe older children will easily relate to its themes, and grown-ups alike.

This film came right on time. In an age where kids are going up faster and are more knowledgeable, it is high time that many of today's animated family oriented tales feature more REALITY. This is definately one of Disney's best, hands-down, no doubt about it! There are no ghosts, no goblins, you don't even have a prince charming in this one (LOL); this film brings reality, comedy and wit all in one neat package. Besides the permanent presence of aliens, this Disney film is as close to reality as it gets.",1108080000,,1295,4.828828828828829
81718,5,0788832182,"Stitch is a genetically engineered alien creature programmed for mass disruption who is bulletproof and super strong. Lilo is the troubled little Hawaiian girl who adopts Stitch as her pet dog when he escapes captivity on his home planet. This beautifully animated film is full of imaginative, whimsical characters and I found it very entertaining. Thankfully, it contains no unnecessary musical numbers.

I don't like musicals, so any time a Disney film comes along without any silly musical numbers it already has a positive head start with me. That isn't to say Lilo lacks signing and dancing completely - there is a traditional Hawaiian performance at the beginning and end of the film, and also a number of unexpected Elvis songs. The Hawaiian traditional fit in with the setting of the film so it didn't have that contrived feel of most animated musical numbers, like say, everything from Lion King. My initial knee-jerk reaction to it was - this must be some liberal, multicultural Disney pandering, but it really had a natural feel to it so I didn't mind at all. And the notion of a little Hawaiian girl being a devoted Elvis fan at such a young age is hilarious and just plain fun.

Stitch spends most of the film on the run from the crazy scientist who created him as well as a specialist on the planet Earth. Lilo is cared for by her big sister after their parents died in an accident. This lack of family by both Lilo and Stitch serves as the foundation of their friendship.

Stitch is a great little monster - he was designed to cause chaos but finds himself on the peaceful island of Hawaii. He has a tendency to tear up everything in sight but without any large cities to terrorize he must find a new purpose for himself. The story develops this family theme throughout and manages to tug at the audience's heart strings without being too obvious about it. Stitch is the result of illegal genetic engineering, and you might expect the film to get a little preachy on the subject. Fortunately it does not, but we can infer that the film takes the stance that any such living creature has the right to its own life.

The animation is outstanding with brilliant, vivid colors dominating nearly every scene. The film had a more traditional, hand drawn feel to it than the more geometrically drawn features like Toy Story or the super realistic Shrek or Monsters, Inc.",1101859200,,2378,4.681818181818182

81720,5,0788832182,"""Lilo & Stitch"" never really caught my attention until seeing some hilarious trailers that involved Stitch ruining moments in past Disney movies: Ariel, the lil' redheaded mermaid, sings but Stitch comes riding in on a huge tidal wave heading towards Ariel; Belle and the Beast are having their dance but lil' Stitch is on top of a chandelier that comes crashing down nearly hitting the two characters; Jasmine and Aladdin are riding on a carpet singing away when Stitch arrives on a space ship, wooing Jasmine who then rides along with Stitch, leaving Aladdin in the dust; all the animals go to Pride Rock to see Simba's ceremony, only to be greeted with Stitch. ""Hey, that's not Simba!"" says Timon, then the animals run off in terror and disgust.

And each characters' response to Stitch: Get your own movie.

Indeed, lil' Stitch does get his own movie. I've always heard positive responses to this movie. Anyone I knew that seen this movie loved it. Newspaper articles praised it for its humor and use of Elvis music. Ebert loved the movie, but his buddy Roeper hated it. Oh well, Ebert's the man!

Sadly, I wouldn't be able to view the movie myself until it was to be released on DVD.

Prior to ""Lilo & Stitch,"" Disney didn't have the movie that really grabs you (this excludes the Pixar ones). Let's face it, ""Atlantis"" was a complete disaster. ""Fantasia 2000"" just wasn't ""Fantasia."" ""The Emperor's New Groove""... absolutely hilarious, I'll give 'em that. And also something lacking in Disney's trademark: musicals. Thinking of all this, I felt that ""Lilo & Stitch"" was going to be another disaster.

Once I finally bought it on DVD (I took a chance), little did I realize that I was gonna be completely amazed by the movie. The movie packs action, plenty of humor, and a charming storyline. Stitch (aka: Experiment 626) was created my a mad alien scientist to fulfill one duty: destroy everything. Both were captured and put on trial. Stitch was to be taken away, but he escapes and takes refuge on Earth in a lil' place we all know as Hawaii. There he becomes contained... in an animal shelter. A girl comes by to find a suitable pet. She finds Stitch, thinking he's a puppy. The girl's name is Lilo. And thus begins the duo's adventures, whether they'd be wacky or compassionate.

The movie also centers around Lilo's personal life and her relationship with her older sister. With their parents deceased, Lilo's older sister must care for the both of them. Lilo's sister, Nani, is also having a big problem with a social worker, named Cobra Bubbles (*snicker snicker*). Nani is trying to be a suitable mom for Lilo, but is faced with also losing Lilo. Pretty deep and touchy themes for a Disney movie.

Lilo tries to teach Stitch some manners as well. Stitch is very short-tempered, but he learns quickly. And to add more to the duo's wacky adventures, two aliens are tracking down Stitch: the alien that created Stitch, and a counterpart who is to keep things under control.

The movie's main theme is being a family and how a family can go through hard times. But in the end, the family always manages to pull through and stick together. The word ""Owahana"" describes the meaning of family (the meaning I forgot, but I will post when I remember).

""Lilo & Stitch"" is not like the past Disney movies. Though the movie itself may seem silly, it packs a darker tone that hasn't been in a Disney movie since ""The Lion King."" An obnoxious little alien bent on destruction almost destroyed the most important value in everyone's lives: a family.

""Lilo & Stitch"" then became one of my favorite Disney movies (if not, my favorite Disney movie ever). The animation rarely uses computer animation (finally... a cartoon that actually looks like a cartoon). And each time I watched the movie afterward, it always felt as if I'm watching it for the first time again. Rarely does a movie have such an impact on me.

So much so that we managed to wear out our first DVD and had to buy a second one.  The story is fresh and funny and the characters are quite loveable, despite the fact that many of them are aliens!  I think I've seen (or heard) this movie so many times that I have most of the dialogue memorized.  That said, it still remains to be funny each time it's played so it has to be good, right?

81722,5,0788832182,"There have been some fine Disney animated features over the years, but this is the one that I watch over and over again. For my money, this stands head and shoulders above the rest of the animated movies I've seen (and I try to see them all).

ANIMATION - A+: In the opening scene of the hula dancers, observe the reflections of the dancers on the wood floor. Wow!

PRODUCTION VALUES - A+: The movie is visually stunning. The backgrounds look like watercolor paintings and are extremely colorful. The backgrounds completely capture the look, colors, and flavor of living in a small town in Hawaii.

CHARACTER DESIGN - A+: The directors took great pains to design the look of the characters. Unlike most Disney women characters, the older sister has some meat on her bones and looks athletic, not anemic. Hallelujah! A more realistic approach to portraying women.

Lilo reminds me so much of my Hawaiian nieces in the way she moves and speaks! And the feistiness of her! Some people have said she does not present a good role model for children! I would say that she is a much more realistic child than usually shown in movies. I LOVE her spunk and strong personality!

My heart was completely captured by Stitch! What a roly poly, cute character he is. Chris Sanders, the director, provided the temporary voice of Stitch, but did such a great job that they kept his voice in the final movie. I can't imagine Stitch sounding any other way.

MUSIC = A+: Wow! The choral music sung by Hawaiian children is wonderfully moving! And of course, the King (Elvis)! Very appropriate as he was extremely popular in Hawaii.

TARGET AUDIENCE = B: The movie is SO entertaining for adults that I rather wonder if it isn't more enjoyable for adults than kids. I know that my three-year old niece wouldn't watch it because she thought the beginning was too ""scary."" Whereas, I've watched it maybe 5 or 6 times and laughed each time at the Elvis jokes and some of the other jokes that I think might go over the heads of children.

And just between you and me (nobody else is reading this, right?), there are a few moments when Stitch reads the story of the Ugly Duckling, realizing that he too is separated from any family, and when he prepares to leave Lilo that always make me cry. How a little furry animated character can show dignity and nobility I don't know, but he does.

I find the movie a delight visually, musically, emotionally, and it makes me laugh!

DVD EXTRAS = A+: I thought the extras on the DVD were quite nice. A great documentary on how the animators ""got"" the hula by attending a hula school, and a nice piece on the main animators and on the children's choir that sang the Hawaiian-style choral music in the film. Also lots of information on the Hawaiian islands.",1099440000,31,2768,4.573737373737374

With the success of movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc, it seems computer generated animation rules the roost these days. If only Disney others would go back to the drawing board and lavish the kind of care on their new projects that was evident for the likes of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King""!

Lately Disney's M.O. seems to be: Make the animation using as few colors as possible i.e. (powder blue, brown, muted red, and possibly one or two other colors).  Many scenes in Stitch seem to have backdrops done in watercolor. DreamWorks and Pixar will be my choice for animation if this is the best Disney can do-they exhibit good color, depth of field, even if sometimes exaggerated,[ex. the trees in the background in certain scenes in Shrek had too much haze in an effort to simulate the contrast between the foreground and background] texture, and great sound. I'll keep The Lion King,
Shrek and other quality animation DVDs, but Stitch and Atlantis have got to go. To digress for a moment, the animation in Atlantis was dark, used a limited amount of colors, and had unatural lines especially on body parts, i.e. squared off fingers and fingernails, squared off muscles and the like.

It had to grow on me a little bit before I realized just how great this movie about a little alien experiment trying to find a home was.  The message in the film is simple, but speaks volumes:  Family means that no one gets left behind or forgotten.  Lilo and her sister Nani accept Stitch into their family(ohana, in Hawaiian terms).  Lilo loves him right away, but Nani takes a little longer to convince that Stitch belongs.  Lilo and Stitch have some wild adventures together and even fight with each other when Stitch gets blamed for tearing apart the little family.
In classic Disney style, Stitch saves the day and proves that even if you aren't born into a family, you can become part of one.
This movie is a wholesome, fun movie for the entire family.  It holds the attention of the youngsters and the storyline is solid enough to keep adults interested.
The DVD has a number of extras that include a documentary on the Hula dance and how much time was spent to get it just right for the movie.

81757,4,0788832182,"Traditional animation has taken quite a few hits in recent years and some from the studio you would least suspect, Disney. Disney's last traditional animated effort, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, only managed to gather $84 million by the end of its run, well short of the film's $120 million budget. Many recent Disney animated features have suffered from bloated budgets of which include Fantasia 2000 ($90 million budget), Tarzan ($130 million), and the studio's holiday animated release, Treasure Planet ($140 million). Then how has this genre been able to survive? Thanks in part to the Walt Disney Company's Florida animation facility, they have been able to produce the occasional hit to keep the animation wing of the studio chugging along. Traditional animation needs a hit more then ever due to the failures of not only Disney but Dreamworks, Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox which seem to signal the end of this motion picture staple genre.
The story centers on a mischievous alien who crash lands on Earth and learns the meaning of family from his new friends. Experiment 626, created by the mad scientist Jumbaa, is declared a huge hazard to the universe and is ordered by the Galactic Federation to be exiled on a far distant asteroid. Unfortunately things quickly go wrong and 626 hijacks a space cruiser only to crash into the Hawaiian Islands on the planet Earth. Being mistaken for a normal dog, a misunderstood girl named Lilo adopts the galactic criminal and dubs him Stitch. Unbeknownst to his adopted family, Stitch had been programmed to destroy everything in sight and nothing else but over time the fugitive learns accepts the love of his new friends and learns the meaning of family. The story for Lilo & Stitch starts off a little slow at the beginning but as the film goes on, it quickly picks up and comes off as being unique and well done. One thing that can clearly be said is that the plot holds up much better then Atlantis: The Lost Empire, which suffered severely especially in its third act.
Stitch may look ugly but, as he puts it, he's just ""cute and fluffy"". The character of Stitch has to be one of the most original creations coming from Disney animation. Certainly he is more different then any other Disney animated character and that is probably why he is so loveable. The Walt Disney Company will definitely be making a fine coin off this wonderful creation based on merchandise sales this summer to be sure. Be forewarned that some smaller children may be frightened by some of Stitch's mischievous antics at the beginning of the feature but they are nothing of huge concern. The character of Lilo, who is a typical six year old who is cute and weird but also has a bit of a dark side, is probably one of the most down to Earth animated characters ever. She feeds a fish peanut butter sandwiches everyday believing it controls the weather and when another little girl makes a comment, Lilo jumps on her and punches her. Her antics worry the audience and yet at the same time we can't help but feel sorry for the way others treat her. The only problem found in the cast of characters lies with the background aliens. Though there are a variety of them in the feature, they aren't as unique to audience members as the aliens in Men In Black or Evolution but it is difficult to do that with so many alien features in recent years.
Overall, Lilo & Stitch is a pure Disney gem and ranks up there with many of the past traditional animated classics. Certainly the film doesn't match up with the artistic merits of The Lion King or Aladdin but its own unique style makes it stand out from the rest of the box office pack this summer. This has to be one of the most different Disney animated films in recent memory but the studio needs to keep up with its ever changing audience. Stitch suffers from a slow start and over cuteness in the story department but there is tons of humor that mixes well with the overall story and delightful characters that makes up for those small squabbles. Despite featuring no original songs, the soundtrack for Lilo & Stitch offers several Elvis Presley songs that go extremely well with the actions occurring in the film. Lilo & Stitch is definitely one of the best comedies of the year and should be considered one of most unique and outstanding animated features in recent years.",1072656000,,4353,4.6766623207301175

Monsters Inc was entertaining but isn't really designed for repeated viewing,and,no offence anyone,but Finding Nemo was awful!

Stich, the little devil!, starts out nasty, mean and uncontrollable.  As he learns the value and importance of family, we see a different Stitch.
Nani and David also emerge from the initial stages from a pupply love type of romance to a full-blown parental affection for both Lilo and Stitch.
I liked the female alien leader, mainly because of her wonderful accent (voiced by the marvelous Zoe Caldwell), and the fact that she reminded me of the mother creature in ""Alien.""

81760,5,0788832182,"After a long break in good movies, the Walt Disney Company has been able to miraculously create a movie comparable to its classics.  It seemed like for quite some time the Walt Disney Company had run out of ideas, so it resorted to making sequels for many of its classic movies.  Then, without warning, the Walt Disney Company came up with a brilliant idea for a movie.  The movie was ""Lilo and Stitch,"" and it seems to have become an instant classic.
When I first heard of the movie, I thought that it was going to be another pathetic attempt to turn an original idea into a movie, but much to my surprise it was quite the opposite.  The commercials leading up to the release of ""Lilo and Stitch"" portrayed the movie as a movie directed toward young boys, with aliens and guns, but it turned out to be a movie that everyone could enjoy.
Up until ""Lilo and Stitch"" came out, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was my favorite Walt Disney movie.  Instantly, ""Lilo and Stitch"" became my favorite Walt Disney movie, in addition to ""Sleeping Beauty,"" of course.  The story line behind ""Lilo and Stitch"" is like many I have heard before, but with a unique twist.
Lilo, one of the movie's two main characters, was an oddball.  Not liked by her peers, her sister decided to adopt a pet for Lilo to befriend, but gets more than she had hoped for.  Not only is this movie adorable, but it also has a good message behind it.  The moral of the movie is to not care what other people think, but to always believe in yourself and know that the people who truly matter will always be there for you, a moral that every child should have bestowed upon them.
Another positive message one receives after watching this movie is one concerning self-image.  In this movie, all of the characters are drawn to proportion, and do not look unhealthy due to how skinny they are.  The characters look like real people, not fat, but also not sculpted and perfected.  When a child sees this movie, he or she will see that not everyone can have a perfect body or look sleek and slender, but that it is okay to be healthy.
Lilo is able to hula her way into the heart of many people who watch Lilo and Stitch, and as a result has become a favorite Disney character of mine.  Like many other Walt Disney Company movies, Lilo and Stitch also has a sequel, but this sequel is not cheesy like most sequels are.  Rather, this sequel is nearly as good as Lilo and Stitch was.  If you enjoy ""Lilo and Stitch,"" I would highly recommend seeing ""Stitch! The Movie.""  Also, if you enjoy the idea behind ""Lilo and Stitch,"" I would recommend ""Lilo and Stitch: The Series.""  Each of these installments is a continuation of the idea behind ""Lilo and Stitch.""
The Walt Disney Company really made a wise choice in creating this movie.  I know that I loved all aspects and installments involving ""Lilo and Stitch,"" and I hope that you will to.  Aloha!",1070236800,,2884,4.448669201520913

Kids, of course, are going to love Stitch and the aliens.  Now, they are funny, but for me, the funniest part of the movie is the interaction between Lilo and her older sister.
I, myself, have a younger brother who's thirteen years younger than I, so I found myself laughing hysterically because I've been in those situations.  The joke about ""maybe you should trade me in a get a rabbit instead!"" is still a favorite around my parent's house.
In any event, this has been the funniest Disney movie in years.  Anybody with kids needs this on their movie shelf.",1070150400,2,760,4.4855072463768115

This movie is just plain spactacular!!
A girl named Lilo and her older Sister Nonnie live in a little house on Hawaii. Meanwhile in space,a mad scientist named Jumba creats experiment 626 A.K.A. Stich. The space council considers 626 an abomination so they lock up Jumba and are about to send 626 somewhere into space,just then 626 escapes,takes a ship,and blasts out into space,unfortunatly,he lands right on Hawaii.
He gets run over by 3 or 4 trucks,the people that were driving the trucks gave him to the pet store.
Lilo and Nonnie go to the pet store one day and get Stich.
For the first 1/2 of the movie their enemys are Jumba and Pleakly.
The 2nd 1/2 is where the TRUE enemy steps in,Ganto(i may have spelled that wrong.)2nd leader of the council.

81763,5,0788832182,"Great movie. My daughter, who was almost 2 when she fell in love with it, loves it as to my husband and I. The only downfall I caught was that my daughter now licks mine and my husbands arms (Lilo licked her sisters arm when she caught her to ask her why she acted the way she did) when we're trying to talk to her. She also learned to throw herself face down on the floor and mumble unaudiable words when she did something wrong (also a scene when Lilo's sister tried to talk to her about the way she did when the Social Worker visited). She started throwing all her toys in the center of her room and growl stomping through them, throwing them up in the air and screaming (Stitch built the town in Lilo's room and then ""destroyed"" it). I just found it to be influencial - and not in a good way.
We took the movie away for about 3 months and slowly reintroduced it to her, explaining (while watching the movie)that Lilo was being a baby and that she was whininng because what she did was bad. Also telling our daughter that Stitch was behaving badly.

81764,5,0788832182,"Perhaps the Disney film least like the Disney formula released in decades, ""Lilo & Stitch"" looks and feels like a high quality release from some upstart animation company.
Moving across a water-colored Hawaiian backdrop -- but eschewing the overblown glossy and even insulting way ""Pocahantas"" portrayed the relationship between native peoples and their environment -- Lilo and Stitch are perhaps the least-cuddly Disney characters ever, and thus, likely the most realistic. Lilo is something of a monstrous little girl, of the sort recognizable on every playground but seldom seen in movies (and certainly not in G-rated movies). Her acting out has reason, but understanding it doesn't magically excuse it or resolve her misbehavior. She's also distinctly not picture-perfect: She's round, not particularly attractive, and even her comparitively willowy older sister has real world hips and a non-ideal figure. It's a refreshing change from the ordinary Disney film, where we're told the proto-supermodel characters are just ordinary girls, despite their beauty, brilliance and perfect behavior. Girls of all ages will recognize themselves in Lilo and Nani.
Which isn't to say the characters don't have sympathetic traits: Stitch's scene recreating ""The Ugly Duckling"" is one of the most heart-breaking scenes in animated film history -- it would take being a real alien monster not to feel a twinge and a damp eye.
In a break from Disney animated films, we don't get new songs written for the film. Rather, Lilo's love of Elvis Presley -- on LPs, at that -- forms the soundtrack for the film. It's a gamble that works wonderfully and probably will serve as the introduction for new generations to the works of Elvis.
Eschewing the dramatic life changes that are so standard in Disney films, ""Lilo & Stitch"" wraps up with a single important lesson: Family is something you define for yourself. It's a believable and important lesson that is nicely understated in the finale.
Strongly recommended to audiences of all ages, particularly older fans who feel that Disney films have tended to blur together in recent years. ""Lilo & Stitch"" is different, with a fresh voice and rough edges. A diamond wonderfully in the rough.",1068595200,4,2221,5.206703910614525
81765,3,0788832182,"Sure, this Disney flick comes bundled with a message about family (O-Hana) the importance of sticking together and not leaving any of its members behind, but the story... it sometimes strikes me as a bit of a departure from Monsters, Inc. (the ""Evil Genius"" who created him and one-eyed Pleakley being two characters that strike me as almost having been directly extracted from the Pixar movie hit). As for animation, I was particularly impressed with the underwater ""shots"" when the characters are surfing: beautiful scenes!
The source of inspiration and the quality of animation aside, I can't still put my finger on the movie as a whole. It's not just weird or odd, granted that Stitch is perhaps one of the most disfunctional Disney characters in a long time... an extended version of the Beast, but created in an extraterrestrial lab, instead of being the victim of a spell. If you add to that the fact that his earthly family is rather disfunctional too, you have a recipe for a very different movie. It's not bad at all, it's just SO different, that I don't see a whole lot of people loving it so easily like some other Disney classics (nor do I honestly see it becoming another such classic).",1067212800,6,1200,4.719047619047619

81804,5,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch is a great, great movie.  It harkens back to a simpler storyline about family, and suprisingly for a Disney movie, it's about a dysfunctional family.  An older sister tries, with great dismay, to raise her little sister (Lilo) after their parents die in a car accident.  It proves extremely difficult with the young girls outlandish behavior and rebelious attitude.  She's not a bad kid, but it's obvious she is acting this way because she isn't sure how to handle her parents death.  Her sister tries everything from rewards to tough love.  Nothing works and the local family services agent, Cobra Bubbles (a great character voiced by Ving Rhames) threatens to take her away.  Enter Stitch, a geneticlly engineered exterrestrial who, after wreaking great havoc, finds behavior beyond his genetic programming.  He discovers he wants what Lilo wants; a family, even if its broken.  Stitch's chaotic/intelligent/detructive and benign behavior leads to several funny moments and lends to a character development that is unexpected from something so hilariously vicious.  This movie is highly recommended.  It's great fun, and it will tug at the emotions in a good way.

***update***  I just read a review by what seemed to be an irrate parent about the violence in this movie.  Please note the rateing; PG.  Yes, there is some violence, DUH!  The movie is about a destructive alien that escapes his captors.  It's necessary to show this character trait so you can see his transition to a gentler being when he discovers he wants to be part of something, most notably a family.  This 'irrate parent' needs to look closely at what his kids are watching.  There is a reason for the PG rating and quite frankly, it's really not for children under the age of four or five...that's why it's PG.
Which stands for PARENTAL GUIDANCE, meaning the PARENT needs to guide their child to this movie, through it, or away from it.  The makers of the movie & the MPAA did their job by giving it the rating, now you as a parent have to do your job.",1054771200,,2043,4.799426934097421

1. It features a great performance by Daveigh Chase.  (Incidently, she was the actress that played the creepy little girl in ""The Ring"", and she also voiced the girl in ""Spirited Away"".)
2. It has a simple and charming story, and there are some very funny moments, like the segment concerning San Francisco.
3. Comforting character and background designs.  As explained in the extra section of the DVD, the animators emphasized roundness in this animation.  The result is unusual but visually very comforting.
4. Beautiful Hula dance sequences.  Animation made this dance even more beautiful than live actions.",1053993600,,715,5.02542372881356

81808,3,0788832182,"Finally Disney breaks out of its tiring animation rut with a story about a destructive alien adopted by a troubled orphan girl on Hawaii. No wicked uncle, no comic sidekick, and a refreshing break from the tried-and-true animation style that worked for Disney through the '90s but has fallen flat in recent years. Kudos also goes to the studio for the Elvis soundtrack and the addition of a couple fantastic songs by Hawaiian peformer Mark Keali'i Ho'Omalu. Sure beats another tired Phil Collins or Elton John hatchet job.
Unfortunately, these points are overshadowed by a heavyhanded story that crams the square peg of an ugly duckling fable into the round hole of a kid trying to find her place in the world. Apart from Lilo (Daveigh Chase) and the social worker (Ving Rhames), the voices are mediocre. While Dreamworks gets top talent like Steve Martin and Rosie Perez to do *secondary* roles in their animated movies, Disney largely settles for second-tier actors in this one. One alien mad scientist speaks with a Russian accent. Why? I'm not sure.
The movie is also violent, and I agree with one reviewer here that the characters are often just mean to other. I am not a prude by any means, but I was a tad alarmed at what they allowed in this film. In one scene, the little girl Lilo gets in a fight in which she pounces on another girl and very graphically punches her in the face. Shortly thereafter she gets in a screaming match with her older sister in which they hurl insults at each other. While this is hardly R-rated or even PG-13 material, it was enough to give me pause about the effect on my 18-month-old son.
Another gripe is the near-total failure to make use of the Hawaii setting, certainly one of the most gorgeous locations an animator could ask for. Apart from one surf scene and a chase involving space ships at the end, little is seen of the islands. Contrast this Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (another Dreamworks film, incidentally), which made liberal use of its wild west setting to show canyons, fields, mountain ranges, rivers, etc.
That's what I think. But what about my 18-month old son? He actually loves it, and has been his preferred viewing for more than a month now! He walks around saying ""Aliens!"", and loves it when we recite snippets of dialogue or hum the music. It does have enough action and color to keep his interest even now.

The movie just seemed too unconventional for Disney for me to consider.  But I []decided to watch it and was really glad I did.  This movie was a lot of fun and I thought that fun was missing from a lot of movies these days.  (I will spare the plot recap because every other review includes one.)  I thought that it was a fresh breath of air that I've needed since there were very few good movies that came out that summer.  I would highly recommend this movie and if not as a purchase, as least consider a rental.
On the level of story development, I believe it was well done.  Some have said rather harsh statements regarding the characters and story, but for some reason or another they may have not connected to the movie like I have.  I am not an orphan and do not live in a broken home, but I don't think you need this history to feel the emotion and understand the characters.  And while many have criticized the film for being a little violent, remember it was rated as PG.  That should have given you some indication of how the movie would be.  Just lay back and try to not be too critical because you could just be missing out on a great heart-felt and funny film.
Surprisingly, I haven't read anyone talk about the extra DVD features.  I think they are excellent.  They give so much insight to the process of making the film that even if you do not like the movie, you may appreciate it more.

81812,5,0788832182,"There are very few movies on which I am actually willing to spend money, and before this movie, I could easily have crossed Disney off the list without a thought.  ""Lilo and Stitch"" is a wonderful story in which the main conflict has very little to do with the climactic battle/chase scene (which all kids movies seem to require these days), but rather with the definition and the bonds of family.  It's nice to have a family movie with redemption and warm fuzzies without a mother, a father and two point three kids at the end so you know everything is OK.  To misquote the movie: ""This is my family.  It may be a little broken...""
Additionally, the art is phenomenal.  Finally, a movie in which the women do not resemble Barbie Dolls or super-skeletons... er supermodels.
Of course, my favorite line from the movie turns out to be in the deleted scenes section.  ""I'm worth twenty rabbits?""  :-)  A movie that can bring tears to my eyes even on the third viewing is a rare gem.

81827,4,0788832182,"The best thing I can say about this film, is that it is the closest Disney has ever come to capturing the same magic as a Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke) film.
In the U.S., cartoons are for kids. Everyone knows that. Even when they aren't for kids (ie South Park) people will ignorantly rise up and complain that the content isn't suitable for kids. Adults who watch cartoons (unless it's the Simpsons) are labeled freaks or dorks. Especially those who import cartoons from Japan; watch out! And because cartoons are soley for kids, we must dumb them down appropriately. Even though your kid likely is the one who set up your DVD player and fixed your email problem, they still aren't smart like adults right?
Even when I was a kid, I hated media directed at kids for the same reason adults don't want to watch it; because it's bad. Disney tries to incorporate adult themes into most of it's films these days in order to make them more appealing to adults. They are after all the ones who take the kids to the movies. But inevitably, every Disney movie has it's childish points. Lilo and Stitch is no different, but what makes it special is it's originality and coming of age themes. If you've ever been fortunate enough to see a Miyazaki film such as My Neighbor Tototo, Kiki's Delivery Service, or Spirited Away, you should have an idea of what I'm talking about. Most of the time, Disney sticks to the tried and true formula of adapting fairy tales, but these stories never deal with real issues. Wouldn't it be nice if you really could fix the world with true loves kiss?
On the outside, Lilo and Stitch doesn't seem that interesting (which is why I waited for video and even then it took a while). But I guess the old saying 'don't just a book by it's cover' should apply to movies too, or at least this one. This is really the most impressive Disney movie to come out since Lion King. If it weren't for the few dumbed down parts with childish antics, and maybe with a little refining of the storytelling, it would have been a five star movie. Still, it's one of the few Disney films I'd recommend to adults.",1050969600,2,2131,4.494845360824742
81828,5,0788832182,"Lord, this is the funniest Disney movie in years.  And one of the most inventive.  A problem in most Disney movies in recent years (well, actually, always) has been taking plots from other sources.  None of the Disney animated films have been in any sense original.  Contrast this with Japan's great animator Hayao Miyazaki, whose movies are almost always based upon original sources.  I don't think it is an accident that the best Disney movie in a long time is based on a completely original story.
Speaking of Miyazaki, Daveigh Chase, who provides the voice for Lilo, also did the voice for Chihiro in the English language dubbing for SPIRITED AWAY.  Unbelievably, she dubbed the voice for major characters in the two best-animated films of the year.  I have to be honest here:  I was really scared that LILO AND STITCH was going to win the.  It didn't.  It is very, very good, but SPIRITED AWAY is not merely the best-animated film in the past couple of decades, but quite possibly the best ever.  I knew that if the voters only watched both LILO AND STITCH and SPIRITED AWAY, then the latter would easily win the Oscar.  Luckily, enough did, and it won a well-deserved Oscar.  But LILO AND STITCH was a very strong second, and in many years would have won.
The film is the story of the accidentally pairing of two misfits.  Lilo is a Hawaiian girl who is being raised by her sister Nani, and Stitch is a genetic creation of an ""evil genius"" mad doctor, a powerful warrior creature.  Lilo has lost her family, and Stitch, or ""Experiment 626,"" as he is otherwise known, has never had one.  The movie essentially tells the story of how each helps the other find what she and he both need most.
Hopefully, this is the beginning of a new practice:  instead of creating an endless number of variations of old, traditional, and familiar stories, Disney will turn their resources to original, new, and inventive stories.",1050019200,,1917,4.657738095238095
81829,5,0788832182,"I am very fussy about which Disney films I watch.  So far I have purchased ""Tarzan"" and ""Dinosaur"" on DVD and though I enjoyed them I won't say they won my heart over.
""Lilo and Stitch"" however had me laughing and crying in the same breath.  Set in Hawaii this is a very different kind of Disney film.  I loved it from the very first moment when Lilo tried to explain to her dancing teacher why she had to feed a friendly dolphin peanut butter sandwiches rather than tuna to the moment Stitch realises he wants a family of his own to belong to, this gem of a film managed to get under my skin like no other Disney animation.
The plot is quite simple; a genetically created monster escapes a prison ship and heads for earth.  All he has on his mind is destruction and mayhem but fate has something else in store for him and he finds himself pretending to be a dog in order to evade the bounty hunters sent to find him.  His new ""owner"" is a lonely but strong minded little girl called Lilo who is still grieving over the loss of her parents in a car accident.  She calls her new ""dog"" Stitch and gives him unconditional love, something this monster has never known before. Suddenly Stitch's desire for destruction takes a back seat as he tries to help the one person in the whole universe who is not afraid of him.
There are great scenes like Stitch finding a frog in the middle of road but it is him who gets run over by a truck and not the frog but as he is indestructible all that happens is that he gets knocked out.  We see the frog later on in the same road, and Stitch saves it, something he would have never done if he had not met Lilo.  It is a touching scene, not syrupy, just nice and thoughtfully done.  Another scene that is side splittingly funny is when Stitch steals a child's tricycle, jumps on it, grabs Lilo and tries to find his way off the Island only to be told by Lilo that ""isn't it great, there are no cities on the Island?"" Stitch faints when he hears this; he has been genetically programmed to destroy cities!  All of this mayhem and chaos ultimately leads to Stitch having to make a decision.  Does he abandon Lilo and try to escape or does he take on the powers that be that want to destroy him and try and keep his new family together?
Stitch's attempt to save Lilo when she is in danger is hilarious but at the same time quite emotional, surprising for an animated film, especially a Disney one.
The music is great and I'm a fan of Elvis all over again, the songs are really appropriate but let me assure you this is not a musical cartoon, rather it is a cartoon with a selection of songs that blend into the story and plot quite nicely.
The characters are believable, even the ex-CIA Welfare Officer who despite his gruff exterior has a heart of gold, to the obnoxious little girls who tease Lilo for daring to be different.
This is cracking good film for all ages, and I will be very surprised if most people don't like something about it, even if it is just the music score!",1049414400,2,3008,4.250437828371278

Best thing about this movie: it shows that a non-traditional family is just as important as a traditional one. That's something all of America needs to realize. After all, a family is defined by LOVE.
(Be warned though: this movie has an edge to it and it may not be suitable for all children. It is Rated PG, not Rated G like most Disney animated features. Personally, I would feel comfortable showing it to any child over five years of age.)",1049241600,2,660,4.64957264957265

81843,4,0788832182,"The reason this gets only four stars is that the bar is so high these days for children's entertainment.  This is a delightful story about a Hawaiian girl who adopts an outer space alien from a dog pound.  The alien doesn't really look like a dog, in fact it doesn't look anything like any animal on earth.  But the other dogs are so afraid of it that they are literally hiding in the rafters.  You see, the creature is a genetic experiment gone bad, which was sent by it's home planet to be shipped far away, but escapes on the way and ends up on earth.
So we get the usual scenes in this kind of movie, where the adoptive family needs to adjust to the unusual new family member.  It has it's crisis moments, where it seems that the creature has to leave, and it has it's tender moments, as the bonding grows to strong for this to happen.  We then get the climax where the source of the new family member returns to claim it, and we wait breathlessly to see where it will end up.
This is giving away nothing because it's the same plot that has been in dozens and dozens of stories.  This alone would put it into the one or two-star category, but it has some nice touches to make it very much worth seeing, and keeping.  The fighting between the older sister and her sibling Lilo is terrific dialog, because they have to hide it from foster agencies wanting to take her away.  The story also takes place in Hawaii, which we don't see that often in movies despite it's one-of-a-kind beauty.  Then we see that the alien is really a potentially murderous psychopath, and while we know we won't get wholesale slaughter in a Disney movie, we are apprehensive at times.  And just for the heck of it, the writers decided to give it the ability to act as a stereo speaker when it's fingernail ""plays"" Elvis Presley records.

81845,3,0788832182,"Whilst it might be a bit precipitous to describe Lilo and Stitch as a return to Disney's glory years of the early 90's (comprising of The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King), it is very good and different enough to other Disney films to make it distinguishable.  The premise has a renegade mutant - Stitch - landing on Earth to be adopted by the lonely Lilo.  Lessons of family, belonging and loss are learnt along the way and there's a happy conclusion so there's pretty much all you would expect from a kid's movie.
However, the vivacity with which Lilo and Stitch is delivered makes it stand out as an impressive edition to the canon.  The animation is the best the studio has done in ages, with carefully rendered characters and lush watercolour landscapes that seem to capture the dreamy atmosphere or Hawaii perfectly.  There's also a more toned down version of the wacky humour of The Emperor's New Groove (though not as adult-orientated as the latter), with Stitch dressing up as Elvis and devouring a tourist's camera.  This is the kind of mindless destruction that everyone's been desperate to see in the kind of by-the-numbers plot that Lilo and Stitch represents.  In addition to this, a great deal of thought has obviously gone into fleshing out the characters as well.  In particular, Tia Carrere as Nani, sister and guardian to Lilo and facing losing custody of her is very impressive considering she's pretty much only playing a voice.  Lilo is also a sympathetic character that more kids will be able to identify with, especially seen as she's not the perfect model of childhood nor is her part overtly feminist.  What you've got here is an unpopular kid wanting to get into the 'in' crowd but finding herself alone.  Stitch is also a fantastic little character - cute, funny and lively he adds a real fire to the movie.
The messages of family, loss and friendship may also have been obvious but they are gently done in a way that won't seem at all cloying to parents.  In particular, the scene where Stitch echoes the voice of the ugly duckling in the story who called for his parents to come and find him, only to get no reply, is genuinely touching stuff.  It's perhaps these gentle moments that raise Lilo and Stitch above the average.  Even so, that isn't to say there aren't faults here because there are a few.  The final scenes with a spaceship battle should have been spectacular, but although they're superbly animated they feel very anti-climatic.  Nani's love interest also seems like a staple character that nobody could be bothered with, which is a pity considering the unusual amount of work that obviously went into the main characters.  Of course, the obvious complaint is that this just isn't as good as other Disney films.  The early 90's Disney stuff pretty much hits the nail on the head about what a kid's film should be, whilst later underrated additions such as Pocahontas and the spectacular Hunchback Of Notre Dame dabbled in more dynamic and less upbeat proceedings whilst The Emperor's New Groove carved out an older audience for Disney fare.  Lilo and Stitch is certainly distinguishable but it's no classic.  It's enjoyable, it's well done and it's fairly original, but compared to such masterpieces as the Toy Story films, Lilo and Stitch almost seems redundant.  Still, congratulations should definitely go out to Disney for creating an entertaining little film which has elements of something great but ultimately doesn't fulfil all its promises.",1048550400,2,3525,4.843333333333334
81846,4,0788832182,"I liked this Disney movie, first one since the Lion King. It's cute, fun and hilarious.

The beginning sequence is horrible though, the whole outer space scenes are unbearable. As well as many of the Alien characters, except of course Stitch, and the mosquito one. The movie is laughed-packed, with Elvis music, and even some tears. It is original, and hits close to home. Disney did well, It's been a while, and it will be a while for the next. It's great for little kids, the movie's not only great but the DVD has some great features, including one on how to do the Hula.

81847,5,0788832182,"Ok let's go back a few years. Disney got back to being the greatest animation studio with ""The Little Mermaid"". This was followed by ""The Rescuers Down Under"" which although not considered one of the greats was a follow up worthy of being considered one. Then there was ""Beauty & The Beast"" which is the only animated feature to be nominated as Best Picture for an Academy Award and now is the only one that will ever have done so. Then we had the crowd pleasing ""Aladdin"" and the most successful animated film of all time ""The Lion King"". Afterwards we had the colorful ""Pocahontas"", followed by the extremely underrated ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame"". Then there was the pretty average ""Hercules"", the unique ""Mulan"", the one destined to make more money but didn't aka ""Tarzan"". Then we started to go downhill with the unspectacular but hilariously funny ""The Emperor's New Groove"", plus there was ""Atlantis"". Phew! Now many may consider that Disney haven't made one of the better animated features since ""Pocahontas"", but for me I think they lost it a little later after ""Tarzan"". So now we have ""Lilo & Stitch"" and WE ARE BACK!
This wonderfully entertaining feature tells the story of an alien monster who in trying to avoid being destroyed, flees to Earth where he befriends a girl called Lilo. I think that pretty much sums it up. In ""Lilo & Stitch"", there is comedy, drama, music and most of all fun. Lilo and Stitch are both funny and the supporting characters are also entertaining. There seems to be no effort to make this out to be as big as ""The Lion King"". All Disney do is create a nice, sweet and entertaining animated film with no major expectations, and it is all the better for it. Disney is getting back to what it does best.
The DVD itself is probably the best collection of special features on an animated film DVD. In the past, some animated film DVDs have become so technical and taken the fun aspect out of what was probably had when the film was made.
On this ""Lilo & Stitch"" DVD we have teaser trailers in which Stitch wreaks havoc in other Disney animated film. Those included are-
Beauty And The Beast- Belle and the Beast are dancing and Stitch ends up breaking the chandelier. It falls and Beast has to save Belle from getting hit.
Aladdin- Princess Jasmine is singing ""A Whole New World"" with Aladdin on his flying carpet. Stitch turbos in on his small space ship and invites Jasmine for a ride. Jasmine is impressed by Stitch and goes with him on his ship, leaving Aladdin alone on the magic carpet.
The Little Mermaid- Ariel is singing the reprise of ""Part Of Your World"" and Stitch comes up on a big wave surfing. The wave comes crashing down on Ariel forcing her into the water.
The Lion King- The ""Circle Of Life"" is playing and instead of young Simba being shown to the other animals over the peak, it is Stitch who scares the other animals away
The DVD of ""Lilo & Stitch"" also includes deleted scenes, a behind the scenes look at Wynonna performing ""Burning Love"" and the A*Teens music video: ""I Can't Help Falling in Love with You"" (which actually isn't the whole song- more like a promo)
As well as that we have a short called ""A Stitch in Time"". This hilarious segment is comprised of selections of Disney film images and certain characters have been replaced by Stitch. It is narrated by David Ogden Stiers, and trust me it is hilarious.
The How-to-hula lesson is fascinating as is DisneyPedia: Hawaii, Animating the Hula and On Location with the directors (which is very in-depth). The Build an alien experiment game is also on the DVD and is diverting.
The hightlight of the Special Features though is ""The Young Voices of Hawaii"" featurette which features the children who sing two of the songs in ""Lilo & Stitch"". It is funny and very sweet!
The movie ""Lilo & Stitch"" with these special features could quite easily have been spread out over two discs, but Disney manage to squeeze it all on two. This is probably the best value Disney DVD you will get, and it's the best I've seen Disney compile altogether to date!

It starts following the tradition of the Heavy Metal movie: a space court filled with hundreds of strange beings judging an inventor for creating such a disastrous creature: Stitch. Stitch is condemned and ordered to be transferred to another planet but he escapes using his mighty powers and great intelligence. Until here, the movie is dark, Stitch is a really mean creature not showing any kind of good feelings towards anybody.
He finally lands in Hawaii where he meets Lilo and becomes her pet (after hiding a couple of his 6 arms to ressemble a dog, a blue one with antennas, but a dog anyway).
Here's where fun starts and never ends until the final credits roll up in the screen. Don't miss Stitch in his Elvis impersonation...

Lilo and Nani are sisters who have lost their parents. They love each other, but are having a difficult time making ends meet - both financially and as sisters. Stitch helps them both learn about love, as he tries to evade the intergalactic police who have come to take him back to his home planet.

81851,4,0788832182,"In a nutshell, the reason you should see ""Lilo & Stitch"" is Lilo and Stitch, apparently not so nice girl and very wild animal from the outer space.  In spite of, or to many, because of their wild behaviors, you come to like them anyway.  The film is cute in the 21th century style, which means very edgy.
The greatest part of the entire film is the friendship between a lonely girl Lilo living in Hawaii, and the strange creature (and actually an escaped convict) from the space Stitch.  The lonely girl decides to buy this ""dog"" despite the advice of her guardian/elder sister Nani.  And as you know, troubles ensue before they finally come to need each other.
And other characters are thrown into the story -- a scientist and his assistant who try to capture Stitch, the social worker (who looks like a guy from ""Pulp Fiction"" ... and his voice is provided by Ving Rhames who was in it!), but quite frankly, none of them works as well as the central characters.  But as the girl Lilo and Stitch are so believable that we really hope that they finally get what they want.  And that is the crutial point of the film's success.
The film's humor is always wacky (and far wackier than usual fares of Disney), sometimes sacrificing the coherent storytelling.  Thus you see Elvis impersonation and mayhems in Hawaiian coasts, but the final effect is rewarding.  This is one step ahead of usual Disney animation, and comprises not just messages and beautiful songs; it also shows wild, sometimes devilish behaviors of kids (and the animal), which give an authentic tone to the film.
Also unusual decision is the sisters have no parents; Nani has a kind-hearted male friend, but he is not exactly a boy friend.  In this way, ""Lilo & Stitch"" avoids the pitfalls of clithes (and there are NO boys visible.)  Perhaps you should have known ""Lilo"" is different when you see the name of child actor Daveigh Chase, still 11 years old, who has been in extremely edgy ""Donny Darko"" and unnervingly creepy ""The Ring.""  Oh, and she also gives the voice of the heroine ""Spirited Away,"" another Japanese animation film that is far from the usual outings of Disney.
The backdrops of Hawaii are drawn with water color painting, of which tender hue and touch suitablly enhance the characters' wacky movements.  And for all the weakness of the story, the two main characters Lilo and Stitch will steal your heart.  Provided it is open, of course.",1047254400,,2422,4.670588235294118

Well, since I don't care one whit about political correctness I will sum up LILO AND STITCH briefly as this: A cute Disney comedy with sci fi elements.
Stitch is a koala-like genetic experiment made by aliens: fireproof, bulletproof, has  the ability to think faster than a supercomputer, can see in the dark and move objects 3000 times his size. The only negative is that Stitch is also a lethal weapon, so Stitch is sent into exile, but escapes to Earth en route to prison. A pair of dim witted prisoners are enlisted as bounty hunters,  who will be given their freedom in exchange for Stitch's capture.
Lilo is a cheeky, but lonely little Hawaiian girl with a passion for Elvis music who lives with her older sister Nani. Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company. This results in a visit to an animal shelter where Stitch has been impounded upon his arrival on Earth. Lilo adopts him, but their burgeoning friendship may be being abused by Stitch for his own protection. Meanwhile a social worker is trying to take Lilo away from her sister....
Featuring the voice talents of Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers and Ving Rhames, LILO AND STITCH is a great movie with a humorous script for all ages.",1046908800,,1421,4.590551181102362

Stitch is not a typical, loveable Disney character - he is a menace to the galaxy who runs things his way. However, it is his personal journey through the eyes of the Ugly Duckling story and Lilo's ""ohana"" that he begins to change from Military Experiment into loving family member.
As for Lilo, her struggle to fit in after the loss of her parents is equally real. She is cute without the treacle and unlike typical characters in her situation, continues to be a child in her approach to the larger world. One of the great things with the animation of Lilo is that she is not the beautiful and skinny, cute little girl from page 621 of the writers characterisation manual: she defies the normal by being normal.
The best thing I loved about this movie was definitely the fact that it wasn't sweet, sappy and gooy. It was simply heart warming and innocent. A classic movie that I place up there with Aladdin, the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.",1046822400,3,1285,4.591304347826087
81855,5,0788832182,"This movie is just fantastic, from it's wonderfully unique look, it's GREAT soundtrack (Disney's best! Elvis is still the King!), and it's uplifting message of ""ohana"", a Hawaiian word meaning ""family, or,no one is left behind or forgotten""!! I suggest parents pay close attention to the rating(PG) because little ones below the age of 6 may think acting like Stitch before he finds a family and happiness would be a good idea (it wouldn't be, though he is darned FUNNY when he's bad, as well as when he's good). Lilo is a very sweet but lonely little girl and acts out occasionally. which is understandable, because she misses her parents ( they passed away in a car accident which is referred to, not shown, in a very tender and sweet scene).She is being raised by her older sister, and is incredibly endearing and lovable!!!She and Stitch find their way to better behavior through love of each other and their ""broken but still good"" family.

81856,5,0788832182,"What better way to let children know there is other types of music (and better in my opinion) then to bring the songs of Elvis Presley to the big screen/DVD in a great animated Disney movie!  Because of this movie, my daughter (9-1/2 years) thoroughly enjoys the music of Elvis.  She likes his songs & singing but she also enjoyed hearing Wynona sing her verions of an Elvis song as well as one of the new kids ""pop"" groups sing an Elvis song.
The movie and characters are adorable!  There is some mild violence (thanks to Experiement 626, aka Stitch) but not enough to really warrant any concern (but this is just my opinion - others may have a different opinion).  Lilo is a lonely Hawaiian girl just trying to fit in.  Her parents are now gone and she is living with her older sister who is having difficulties keeping a job and being a guardian to Lilo.  Lilo is allowed to adopt a dog, unfortunately (or fortunate depending on your point of view) the ""dog"" she thinks she is adopting is really an alien, Experiement 626, whom she names Stitch and she instantly loves him.  Stitch is trying to hide from his creator but he was created to distroy everything.  But through all of Lilo's persistance and patience she starts to get through to Stitch and he starts to learn about family and what it means to be in a family (in the words of Lilo; ""Ohana means family and family means no one get's left behind."").
This is a must have for anyone's movie library whether it's for an adult, children or the entire family!  You can't beat the Disney magic, I grew up on Disney and feel this is one of their best!!",1046217600,,1606,4.398648648648648

Since others have summarized the plot and characters, I thought I'd reflect on what makes this film so special.  The real charm of this film lies in how flawed *all* of its characters are.  That, I know, is a big ""minus"" for parents who only want their children exposed to good fictional role models, but I totally disagree.  We all feel flawed at a fundamental level, and the challenge is to rise above that to create goodness in the world.  Lilo is a bully, Stitch is a monster, and Nani is out of her league when is comes to parenting her little sister.

81871,5,0788832182,"Disney has finally come up with a great movie after the Lion King.  If you have lost faith in Disney movies, this movie will change your mind about the movies, although not Disney Channel.  This movie is teen wannabe free.  NO KISSING AND NO TEENAGE WANNABE STUFF.  IT'S NOT LIKE DISNEY CHANNEL.  The only thing close to romance is Nina and David being friends who each have a crush on each other.  No classic teen flirting.
This is the best science fiction cartoon movie Disney came up with.  (not like Atlantis or Treasure Planet)  This movie is worth the money because it will make you want to watch it again because it is a cute story.  Even if you bore it out, within a month or two, you will want to watch it again.
The music in this film is pop star free, except for credits.  No dumb attempts to try to promote the pop music industry.  The music is just movie orchestra music, Hawain choir, and some Elvis songs.  Even the pop music is pretty.
Just buy this, you won't regret it.  This is the best Disney movie.  The technology we have today makes this just as memorable as the old Disney movies",1044835200,,1103,4.3431372549019605
81872,3,0788832182,"Ya know, it's sad when a fun family film like this can be bogged down by worthless PC garbage. I never saw this movie in the theater, I almost didn't even rent it. Why? Because every review or shred of information I read pointed to the character designs. Junk like ""It's so wonderful to see an empowered female character who doesn't fit the barbie cookie-cutter design."" and utter non-sense like that. I figured, judging from what I'd heard, it was nothing but Disney PC garbage. I should have trusted Disney's sense more than that.
Look folks, it's simple. Lilo is slightly overweight and so are a few other characters in the movie. Other characters are very fit and lean. There's a wide mix and this is NOTHING new. This is NOT some kind of PC garbage, this is not woman empowerment, and this has NOTHING to do with the movie. It doesn't make them look ""real"", it doesn't change a freaking thing from any other movie. It's just one tiny little aspect that these lifeless morons decided they wanted make center stage. The characters and locations are wonderfully drawn and animated, and each have their own style.
This of course leads to senseless bashing of all the Disney women of the past. How low can people stoop. I've heard so much garbage now about how Ariel, Jasmine, and the rest are such awful role models for girls. Get a freakin life. Ariel is a MERMAID for crying out loud, and Jasmine's a princess. How can you think that the active, healthy women of Disney films would not LOOK healthy! It's mind numbing.
But, enough of that. Less than 15 minutes into the movie you'll realize this has all been blown so far out of proportion it's not funny, and forget all about it. Disney has put together a movie that's funny, action packed, and filled with great characters. Lilo is a bit of a brat, which is just plain hilarious. It's the only way a relationship between her and Stitch would be even slightly believable. Her older sister Nani is a little pointless, but fills the role none the less. Cobra Bubbles is a stretch to believe, but hey... why not. He's entertaining, and his voice booms loudly over the sub-woofer. It's just fun to hear him talk.
It's far from one of Disney's best, and it's largely forgettable. But hey, it's worth a rental and it's got some good laughs. You'll be hard pressed not to love Stitch no matter what you think of the movie. It's worth renting just to see him alone, but the movie itself should keep you entertained as well. It's not a classic, but it is fun hour and a half... and that's all I expected.

The thing I liked most about this movie was the excellent hand painted backgrounds. They were truly beautiful to look at.

81889,5,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch is the story of a little girl, Lilo, being raised by her sister Nani.  She is allowed to adopt a dog, Stitch, and together Lilo and Stitch find themselves in one situation after another.
This movie was great!  The characters were believeable (OK, except for Stitch).  I was very impressed by the way the characters were drawn.  Thank goodness there were no stick people in this movie!  It was so refreshing to see Nani and Lilo along with the other ""human"" characters in this movie drawn with real bodies and not perfect figures.  I can't express enough how much I was thrilled with this.
The storyline of this movie is very touching.  Lilo has trouble fitting in with other kids her age because of her not having parents.  As to the other reviewers that discussed her behavior--so what!  No child is perfect all the time.  Lilo does act out but that is because she isn't treated nicely by the other kids. She also doesn't have parents to correct her when she's wrong and she has a sister that's busy working so she can keep Lilo with her.  And as to the way Nani and Lilo talked to each other, this just seemed like a typical exchange between siblings.
The soundtrack of this movie was great also!!  I love the way they included the Elvis songs in the movie.  They were put in so that it seemed natural and not just thrown in on a whim. The admiration that Lilo has for Elvis made the songs fit so well. I loved the ""model citizen"" segment.  Stitch in an Elvis jumpsuit is just too cute!!!!!
I loved every aspect of this movie.  I've read other reviews in which the reviewers said there wasn't a moral storyline in the movie.  But there is.  The moral of this story from my viewpoint is this:  don't treat other people badly just because they are different from you.  Lilo was different from the other girls and they excluded her from their group.  That is one of the reasons Stitch appealed to her so much.  She knew he was different but she didn't turn away from him.  She knew how it felt to be the outcast and she didn't want to do that to him.  She was just glad to have a friend.  Another storyline in this movie that I liked was the family and that not all families are the same.  This family was small and broken--but it was good.  In todays society I think it's important for kids to understand that not all families may not be like theirs.  To reviewers that think Snow White has a better moral storyline--hello???  A girl living alone with 7 strange men???  This is a good moral story?????  Think again.
This movie was just awesome.  It was good to see something from Disney that had todays issues in it.  To all the people who didn't like the movie, that's your choice, but I thought this was one of the best animated movies to be released in a long time. I just can't say enough about it, it is quite possibly the best animated movie to ever be released.  A keeper for anyone's collection.",1042848000,,2919,4.376163873370578
81890,4,0788832182,"The last great Disney film was The Lion King. That was 10 years ago and since we've had multitudes of mediocre to dismal regurgitations of that formula. Though Disney tried to mix it up a bit with The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis, they still managed to be only decent. Until now, at least. While Lilo & Stitch does not quite reach the greatness of the Lion King and a few other Disney classics, it is still a really good little film.
What makes it work are two things: Characters we care for, and new, original ideas. Up at the forefront are the title characters: Lilo, an orphaned Hawaiian girl now living in the care of her older sister, and Stitch, a genetically created alien with no family. Lilo's life with her sister is full of tension, and a child services agent may put the young girl into a foster home if things don't improve. No one is perfect in this story, everyone has faults and strengths, and it's this honest portrayal of humans (and, er, aliens) that helps sell this film. This Disney movie really begins to capture much of the heart that's been missing for the past decade in their animated films.
And the music adds the perfect atmosphere to the tropical animation. Using Hawaiian sounds and Elvis Presley tunes, the film uses the right songs at the right moments. And with the laugh out loud comedy in this film (I haven't laughed as much during a Disney cartoon in years), everything comes together beautifully.
With Lilo & Stitch, it seems Disney may be headed in the right direction with their animation franchise. Let's hope it continues in the years to come. And if not, at least we still have Lilo & Stitch.",1042675200,,1640,4.562711864406779
81891,5,0788832182,"This is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen, but I mean that in a good way.  The writers managed to take two very disparate storylines and meld them together seamlessly.  The movie opens somewhere in outer space, where we meet a genetically engineered space alien who was created by a mad scientist to destroy everything in it's path.  The creature is then banished to Earth, where it ends up (in all places) on the island of Kaui in the Hawaiian Islands.  At this point, the movie quickly switches from sci-fi action movie to a tender and heartfelt story of an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo who is being cared for by her older sister.  When she picks up the alien creature in a local pet shelter and names him ""Stitch"", we find the two have more in common than we realize.
The movie is like a warped ""E.T.""  It's the classic ""alien befriends earth child"" story, only the alien isn't exactly friendly at first.  The movie is hip, witty, and moving at the same time.  It really celebrates Hawaiian culture, and it's always refreshing to see a Disney movie where the main characters aren't white.  And I loved the strong female charaters who aren't waiting around to be rescued by prince charming.  This is truly a unique and imaginative film that is fun for all ages.",1042675200,3,1280,4.550218340611353
81892,4,0788832182,"Well not really, the Lion King will likely always be my favorite, but this one has tied with Mulan, and The Emperor's New Groove for my number 2 spot in Disney Films.
 While I'm not normally fond of Disney for their butchery of classic stories (The little Mermaid was turned to stone, and the Hunchback was killed... leave it to Disney to give it a happy ending) as well as Disney's near Microsoft level of world domination every so often they put out a film that I can't ignore. Lately I've been proud of Disney for their putting out films that are a lot more mature, especially with their humor, and the fact that they are no longer afraid of the PG rating. Lilo and Stitch, like the Emperor's New Groove is a slapstick comedy with a lot of mature themes, but one positive theme throughout the film... Family.
 When most of Hollywood is content to underplay the importance of family, and in fact, in many cases diminish it, and degrade it, this film makes it a point to express, to a nearly tear jerking level how important family really is, especially in today's society. I personally felt that the relationship between Lilo and her older sister was very realistic, far from abusive, but misunderstood by the social worker who had been sent to observe the family, or what's left of it after their parents are killed.
 Nani, (Lilo's sister) is bogged down trying to pick up where her parents left off, paying bills, working full time, and taking care of Lilo, a task that has her utterly exhausted. Hoping to help Lilo get a friend she takes her to a local animal shelter where Lilo picks out what she thinks is an innocent puppy, not knowing that this puppy is actually a genetically engineered alien whose soul purpose is to destroy everything in sight, clog drain pipes, back up sewers, and steal everyone's left shoe. Lilo is also unaware of the aliens that have been sent to capture her new pet.
 This film is absolutely hilarious, yet powerful. I really enjoyed it, and its message. I recommend this film for both children and adults, as the movie is by and large inoffensive, with enough movie parody and references for the older folks to enjoy as well...

81899,5,0788832182,"A young Hawaiian girl adopts a pet who is actually an alien fugitive from the law.  This short description doesn't do this movie justice.  This is probably one of the most inventive Disney originals in a long time.  Highly enjoyable for both children and adults.
The characters are almost real.  You can believe that Nani and Lilo have gone through many troubles in their life.  The interaction between Nani and Lilo are very close to what real people would actually do.  That makes Nani (and thus Lilo) more realistic and more believable.  Nani's bit about ""gravity increasing"" makes you believe that she's just a kid at heart with more responsibilities than she may be able to handle yet.  And Lilo reading to Stitch was just precious.
The characters are fantastic.  ""Cobra Bubbles"" indeed.  Some of the ""in"" jokes may go over younger viewers heads, but older viewers in the audience, and certainly the adults, will be laughing along with the kids, just for different reasons.  Watch for the sequences about the mosquito - you will absolutely die laughing when you get to the punchline.
Even the main character's name - ""Stitch"" - suggests something that was sewn together out of parts and pieces.  Older adults will appreciate the use of Elvis tunes throughout the movie to illustrate main points.  Watching Stitch imitate Elvis was one of the better bits.
And the dialog in the movie is fantastic.  The scriptwriters deserve a hearty congratulations for coming up with some of the most memorable lines that have been used in cartoon movies recently.  Examples include: ""No more caffeine for you.""  ""Nah, the manager's a vampire.  He wanted me to join his Legion of the Undead.""  ""Oh, good; my dog found the chainsaw.""  ""So far, you have been adrift in the sheltered harbor of my patience, but I cannot ignore you being jobless.  In case you're wondering, this did not go well.  You have three days to change my mind.""
But it's ""Stitch"" that steals the show.  Even in the commercials for this movie, you knew ""Stitch"" wasn't going to be one of the Disney heroes we have come to expect.  He starts out so bad - whatever he says at the start of the movie was so terrible that it makes some council members faint, and even a robot throws up.  But by the conclusion of the movie he grows into the role of a hero - and that makes him one of the more believable Disney heroes in a =long= time.  Stitch also becomes more like a person in that time - making him even more believable as a character and as a person in his own right.
And the message is equally important.  ""Family means never being left behind - or forgotten.""  Sure, it's one of the messages that Disney is known for promoting.  But it is presented the best when Stitch finally realizes that it means something important to him.  And the family that Stitch knows is preserved.  Perseverance pays.  It is -how- that family is preserved by Stitch that makes this move special.
This film is presented in the time honored frame-by-frame animation technique - a technique that often gets forgotten in these days of computer animation.  Sure the visuals may look a little simple - but that's part of the joy of the old frame-by-frame animation process.  And the characters look more real.  Nani looks a -lot- like what a young Hawaiian woman would look like.  Lilo looks like a kid.  No out-of-proportion human female figures here.
I do not give five star reviews very often - only true classics usually ever get that kind of award from me.  But this movie made me rethink that decision.  Rest assured that this movie will eventually have a place of honor in my library next to such gems as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Little Mermaid"".
BTW, just a quick note here - if you are thinking of purchasing a copy of Lilo and Stitch now, just wait a little while.
Sometime in 2004, Disney will be doing a ""Special Edition"", two disc DVD release that will be similar to thier recent reissue of Sleeping Beauty.
With all of the features on that, people who buy this DVD recently will be disappointed if they didn't wait.
Disney will be including all of the ""Making of"", pre-production art, and other features that make their new ""Special Editions"" great, to the new edition.
There are three other ""Special Editions"" due in 2004 - Mary Poppins, Pocahontas, and Alice in Wonderland. Alice will be the first released in 2004. Also, there's the ""Platinum"" edition of Aladdin in October 2004. Worth waiting for in my opinion. You have been warned. :-)",1042329600,6,4492,4.653553299492386

First of all, I think the film was a terrible example for children, why, oh let me think, the two main characters were a pair of good for nothing creatures, Lilo was a spoiled brat who did anything she wanted and here shield was that her parents were dead, come on, so if a kids parents die that means the kid is free to do as she wants and get what she wants, she was a destructive and stupid girl that thought she was so cool just for liking Elvis, so,not that I hate Elvis, he Is the King of Country, which I enjoy, but that was a very lame addition to this already wreck of a film. And the second character, Stitch was a destructive and vicious animal that looked like he had some sort of disease, I still think he should be put down by a vet or something. This characters are ""wonderful"" role-models for children right. In a time when children are growing more and more dumb and spoiled, do we really need to encourage it even more. I think Disney has lost all of its once wonderful quality, Disney was so desperate of getting people to like this movie so they put in the trailer all of the GOOD movies of the past like The Lion King(the best animated of all time) and Beauty and the Beast(the second) and made it look like if Lilo & Stitch was a spoof, thats why I went to see it, then I saw it, and I went out feeling angry because I spend almost two hours of my life seeing this ""movie"". Everything in it was awful, the story, the characters, the lame and stupid lines and etc. This ""film"" made it look to kids that the best and only way to be was to be like Lilo & Stitch, my little cousin tried to adopt the style of living of thoose two stupid characters, Disney must remember that children get very infuenced by tv and films and if they imitate the behaviour they see, I have seen it happen many times, and do you parents think is correct to condone indicipline, destructiveness and all of the things that were gloryfied in Lilo & Stitch, you may find it amussing, but kids will make it their way of life. If this film wins best animated movie in the Oscars I will really be upset and don't see more of the awards because any person or group of people that condone honour this film don't know anything about movies, I do, I have studied filmaking, and have watched many films, I'm no master, but I know a little, and that is enough to see that this is junk, worst than junk but I cant curse here, so please, See Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron rather than this, because I think that Lilo & Stitch shows most of the many things that are wrong with the world and encourages these mischiefs.",1042243200,7,2811,4.226765799256506

Because of the super team that made this movie, both voice cast and animators, we knew what the characters were feeling - and we felt it too.  This movie grabbed our hearts and dragged us along for the whole super story.  I owned a copy by 9 AM on the first morning this movie went on sale.

As the recent crash-dive of *Treasure Planet* demonstrates, with *Lilo & Stitch* the Disney people set the moviegoing audience's expectations at a much higher level than they can sustainedly achieve.
In terms of plot, character development, visual artistry, ingenuity, insight into human nature, and the proverbial scientifictional ""sense of wonder,"" the corporate clowns at the House of the Mouse have allowed some genuine innovation to escape onto the screen, and as a result they're going to have a horrible time of it for the next couple of years. Apart from the stuff they're second-handing from Pixar, there doesn't seem to be anything in the Disney pipeline that comes close to the high level of quality joyfully splashed across the eyeball by DeBlois and Sanders in *Lilo & Stitch*.
One example of the sheer enjoyment this film can deliver to even a Certified Grump like me is the fact that although I've loathed Elvis Presley from the moment he was first inflicted upon the nation back in the '50s, the writers/directors of this picture actually made me *enjoy* every minute of Lilo's efforts to make a ""model citizen"" out of her green-card-less alien using the Pelvis as her template. Borjemoi!

81906,5,0788832182,"Disney's best animated film is, strangely enough, neither an epic such as Atlantis or The Lion King, but a relatively simple sci-fi comedy about a rowdy alien who befriends a little girl and her older sister.  That alien, in particular, is named Stitch, the end result of genetic experimentation; he exists solely for pure destruction and now that he's loose on Earth, the aliens send his creator to bring him back.
First, let me get into the drawbacks.  The movie takes a bit longer than the usual animated film to get into its central plot (almost a good half hour!) and I can see how that might test a few kids' attention spans.  The animation itself is mostly very good, but some of the backgrounds are static and maybe less in quality than you might expect.  Probably of greatest concern to parents is, given the destructive nature of the movie's titular E.T., it's possible kids might get scared (though I doubt it).
But all in all, these are merely minor quibbles in what is otherwise a terrifically entertaining and heartwarming comedy. The film has appeal for virtually everyone.  The ""edginess"" and surprising unpredictability of the material will please those who tire of the typical Disney formula.  Sure, the story is a partial carbon-copy of Spielberg's E.T., but the filmmakers put enough spin on it to make it a work that stands fitfully on its own.
Animated Disney films usually rely on two elements: crowdpleasing, nonoffensive humor and a heartfelt message.  Some Disney movies vacillate back and forth between these with occasional success while some just fail outright.  Lilo and Stitch, on the other hand, works beautifully as both simultaneously, delivering a palpable relationship between the two sisters, meanwhile showing how their lives are ""wrecked"" by their interaction with Stitch.  The movie's message, the importance of family, is probably nothing new to avid Disney fans, but I've yet to see it delivered as well as it has here.
The voice acting here is excellent; Tia Carerre, Daveigh Chase, Ving Rhames, and Jason Scott Lee all convincingly embed their characters with the right tone.  But the scene-stealer is Stitch, easily the cutest-and possibly greatest-character to come from the Disney vault.  His initial obsession with destruction is hilariously portrayed without going overboard, and his eventual transformation is touching and easy to believe.  If listening to Stitch sincerely state ""Nobody gets left behind"" to Lilo doesn't get you choked up, nothing will.
In the end, though, Lilo and Stitch is touching without getting overly sentimental.  It's fast, exciting, and hilarious, a much needed tonic for Disney, whose animated movies seemed to be getting worse as the years pass by. Add in an enjoyable Elvis soundtrack given a modern spin, and you've got yourself a movie that can be recommended to anyone.",1041984000,3,2853,5.083511777301927
81917,5,0788832182,"Appropriate for all ages is this delightful Disney film that showcases the best in family entertainment that the studio is known for. Drawn with a simpler style of animation than the computer-graphic-enhanced material that they've producing of late, this beautiful film (which looks like a living watercolour painting) centres on a misunderstood little Hawaiian girl named Lilo and her adventures with Stitch, an alien from a planet that rejected it. The two help each other learn the true meaning of family, and along with Lilo's older sister Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere who oddly enough gives her most memorable performance) they make up quite the unconventional clan. Stitch, originally an alien weapon of destruction, is given a lesson in togetherness when he learns that having love in his life is worth his putting his baser tendencies to rest. Very lovingly made, and very enjoyable, with Lilo being a particularly endearing and fun character.",1041984000,8,950,5.215686274509804

A quirky little girl, her older-sister-turned-guardian, her no-nonsense case worker and her newly-adopted extra-terrestrial ""dog"" create a story with a little bit of something for everyone.

81920,1,0788832182,"Shame on you, Disney, for lowering your standards.  I expect better!  Shame on me for assuming I could count on Disney films to present wholesome qualities to my two small children.
Disney presents a storyline far from wholesome in this film.  Lilo attacks another little girl, hitting and biting her.  She does apologize to the girl later and the girl refuses to accept her apology.  She doesn't mind the adults looking after her, and behaves like a BRAT.  Her older sister, and ""example"" runs in front of a car which honks at her.  She, in turn, kicks the car and yells at the driver to ""watch where he's going.""  Now there's anger management.  Lilo and her sister, Nani, stick their tongues out at each other, yell and scream at each other, and resolve problems by screaming into pillows.  Then, there is Stitch...out of control and destructive.
I spent the first half of this movie saying to my very impressionable 3-year old, ""Now that wasn't very nice.  That wasn't very nice either.  We don't talk that way to each other.""  At that point, the movie was turned off.

Disney unfortunately lately has been not only abandoning its marketing division, but has been abandoning its 2d animation program lately, and unfortunately this has affected such great dvds as this one.  While Lilo and Stitch is enjoyable and one of Disney's more successful detatchments from their story norms, the lack of MORE special extras on the DVD simply could add MORE to it.  Recently, however, the demand for a 2 disc special collector's edition of Lilo and Stitch has been announced and will be released within the next year.  I personally, am going to wait until this comes out and purchase it in hopes that this will encourage Disney to put out more special editions like it's Tarzan collector's edition, it's Beauty and the Beast collector's edition, and it's Atlantis Collector's edition, as it will show Disney that people in the audience are not soley interested in the movie, but also have some interest in the process of film making.",1041552000,,1017,4.827586206896552

81937,4,0788832182,"To be frank, I was losing faith in Disney's ability to create an original piece of entertainment.  If it is not a Pixar project, the Disney Animation arm seems creatively adrift.  With lackluster efforts like ""Treasure Planet,"" ""Atlantis"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" failing to catch fire, hearing the title LILO AND STITCH made me scratch my head in wonder.  However, Disney is king when it comes to marketing and the host of teaser trailers used to position the film were inspired.  After watching the unsusual looking Stitch wreck the worlds of Belle, Aladdin and Ariel, I was definitely curious.  After seeing LILO AND STITCH over the summer, I was hooked.  Now, the film is on VHS and DVD and it maintains its luster and appeal in a repeated viewing.
A winning combination of sly humor, moral lessons and Elvis, LILO AND STITCH is a much better experience than MONSTERS INC and ICE AGE.  LILO AND STITCH is very much a personal film, full of warmth and humanity, elements that are even reflected by the animation itself.  While the digitial art of Pixar and the recent SHREK continue to enchant audiences, it is also a cold filmmaking experience to view.  The Hawaiian fantasia of L&S is as welcome as the heroine herself.
What I also found gratifying was how the filmmakers did not parody the ethnicity of their source material.  Some may say the look of Lilo and gang is exaggerated, but after the Barbie Doll look of  ""Pocohontas,"" it was nice to see characters who were not aerobicized.
If anything, it promotes a more normal body aesthetic  for children. However, the real jewel of L&S, however, are its two main characters.
Stitch is wonderfully fun, a mass of audacity and recklessness that had me, well, in stitches.  He's the anti-Tigger, full of abandon and sloppy charm. Some parents took issue with his brazen and gross habits, but he made me cheer.  As for Lilo, she's the outsider we all were at that age.  Innocent to a degree, she's also keenly aware of her world and her quest to forge a friendship with Stitch is tender and real.  The film is about family and its many shapes.  It may be an overtly simplified message, and the script does offer a few clunker sections of dialogue, but there is no denying its impact at the end.  Much of this succeeds with its great voice cast, especially Daveigh Chase and Tia Carrere.
Sure, it has a slow beginning and the space chase at the end goes on way too long, but  this is a memorable Disney effort and one of the year's true delights.  Besides, having the King play a key role in any animated film is something everyone should experience once!",1041292800,,2613,4.639130434782609
81938,5,0788832182,"When I first saw the commercials on the TV advertising Lilo and Stitch I didn't know what to think. It looked somewhat interesting to say the least. I saw it in the theater, not quite knowing what to expect.
I was somewhat surprised. For once, Disney put a truly worthwhile theme in one of their movies. Lilo and her older sister, Nani, are orphans. Nani is trying desperately to keep custody of her little sister but a few problems arise despite her efforts. Coming from a home that isn't quite traditional myself, I was able to relate fairly well to the characters. The characters seemed real (unlike, say, Snow White, or some other passive woman from Disney movies long past). In the words of Stitch: ""My family may be little, and it may be broken, but it's still good . . . yeah, it's still good."" I admit that I cried in that movie.

An evil, if cute, alien?  How novel, how un-Disney, I thought at first.  But it is a clever and modern update to the Ugly Duckling story, after all.  The themes of redemptive love, of finding your place and your 'family' in the world are powerfully played out.  The movie balances humor and seriousness in excellent fashion.

I really do hope they make a Lilo and Stitch 2, and not just a direct-to-video release, but one we can actually see in the theater again. I saw this one twice, have the DVD as well.
My favorite character is Stitch by a long shot. He really makes the movie. And he has got the coolest little attitude! Haha, I'd like to BE Stitch! All the funny things he does make the movie very enjoyable, like hitting that dude in the face with a beach ball. Stitch does alot of things that are very mischievious, but fantastically funny. And while at first he appears to be very angry, he becomes soft and kind hearted, and learns to talk better by the end too. I dunno, I just can't say enough how much I love stitch.

I've also been to Hawaii before and the way they drew the backgrounds is perfect. It's softer than the real colors of hawaii, but very close, and actually prettier if you ask me.

I was thoroughly entertained,  the characters were indeed different enough from other movies and the plot was not a rehashed story.  All though there have been plenty of ""alien"" stories the characters here were original and fresh and the setting of Kauai, Hawaii gave it a  flavor all its own.
My sister told me she cried a couple of times watching this.  I am not that easily moved, yet I understand why she felt the emotions she did.  This movie made it's statement by getting the viewer involved in the life of a little girl and not trying to make some some big political statements like many kids movies have.  We weren't asked to feel bad about people going to war, chopping down trees or ruining some native civilization.  We are just shown a little girl in a tough setting and how she deals with life.
 When she meets the other star of the film, Stitch, the fun begins and the two get into lots of trouble.  The story is basic enough that it is still fun and entertaining for the young, yet has enough going for it that it will be enjoyed by adults as well.
In my house the 20 month old rules the DVD player and a movie that is good by her standards get played over and over.

81946,1,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch is not the clever and entertaining feature that I had expected.  I had read some of the other reviews and thought that it might be another multi-age-level ""classic"" like some other recent personal and family favorites:  Emperor's New Groove, Monster's Inc, Toy Story, or maybe even along the lines of Shrek.  I was wrong.
We are introduced to Stitch, an alien genetic experiment gone wrong that crashes to earth and is placed at the local dog shelter.  Lilo is a young girl first introduced as a child that cannot get along with any friends, lives without parents, is left home alone, and cared for only by her older sister Nani.  The story is further complicated when we are introduced to Nani who is threatened (once again) by the social worker who is going to remove Lilo from the house if things don't improve.  The two stories collide when Nani's solution to Lilo's behavioral problem is to adopt a pet where, of course, Lilo picks Stitch.  Finally, throw in some alien authorities chasing after Stitch and a young boy interested in dating Nani.
The story involves our cacophony of characters chasing one-another to the unbearable end when everything works out so that everyone can live happily ever after in the typical Disney way.  The story is original by its convoluted nature and the moral to the story is essentially that when it comes to being a family, anything goes.  Not in our household, I don't think that Lilo and Stitch will be in the DVD player again, nor will there be any requests from our 5 year old.  I found the story and characters to be a bit disturbing and set a poor example.  If we decide to watch a bad movie, we will stick with the other recent Disney examples that maybe are not so ""original"" such as Pocahontas and Mulan.",1040860800,7,1771,4.60828025477707
81947,5,0788832182,"Ah, Lilo & Stitch, the movie that answers the question ""What would happen if George Lucas, Hayao Miyazaki, and Joe Dante all collaborated on a film.  Lilo & Stitch takes on the old idea of ""child befriends strange creature"" and gives it a refreshing and quirky twist.  Sort of like taking E.T. and replacing E.T. with one of the creatures from Gremlins.  All in all, ""L & S"" does not remind me of a Disney film.  It seems more like something that either Warner Brothers or Dreamworks would produce.  I have seen quite a few negative reviews by the Disney ""purists"" out there complaining of its violence and lack of warmth.  They miss the point!  This is not supposed to be a typical syrupy musical puke-fest Disney typically has released in the last decade. Lilo and Stitch would really be recommended to fans of the nontraditional Buena vista releases such as ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and ""Roger Rabbit"" (both underappreciated films in my opinion) as well as the works of Miyazaki and the oldschool anime of Tezuka Osamu. (even the characters have Tezuka's familiar stumpy looking qualities)  The story begins rather abruptly with no opening credits until about 10 minutes into the film.  In a far off galaxy, a genetic scientist Jumba Jookiba is standing trial for illegally creating a genetic experiment which he calls ""experiment 626"".  626 was designed to be an indestructible weapon of mass destruction (even though he's only 3 feet tall, looks like a blue koala, and sounds like the Andy Kaufman character Latka).  Most surprising about Lilo & Stitch is that most of the time, you can't be sure that you are actually watching a Disney movie.  The film is notably violent by Disney standards and most of the humor can be quite dark at times.  Most noticeable is the absence of traditional Disney musical numbers and cute anthropomorphic animals.  Stitch is a cute alien, but he is also hell-bent on destruction for about the first third of the movie.  As far as Disney films go, Lilo & Stitch has to be one the most realistic I have ever seen.  Lilo's character is the most realistic portrayal of a child in a Disney animated feature.  She is not excruciatingly cute for cuteness sake and she actually behaves like a real child.  She (nor any other character) is allegorical and is not completely good or bad.  Each character has their flaws.  Lilo can be a brat and she can be mean to others but she always tries to love her sister and Stitch.  She always has the patience to put up with Stitch's destructive behavior.  Interestingly enough, she also seems to be the moral center of the film.  When her sister Nani has had enough of Stitch's unpredictable behavior, she threatens to throw him out.  Lilo has to remind her that even though Stitch is less than admirable, he is still family and repeats the movie's catchphrase ""family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten"".  Stitch, even though from the beginning is a destructive little demon, he evolves throughout the film.  He learns about having a family, something he has never had.  He was genetically created with no greater purpose other than to be a one-alien wrecking crew.  As he continues to destroy, he finds out that nobody likes him because of that, eventually even Lilo, the one who saved him from being captured by his creator.  During the second-third of the film he goes through a massive inner conflict between his genetic programming to destroy and his discovery that he could serve a greater purpose and that he is actually loved (at least by one person).  The Elvis soundtrack is a delicious change of pace instead of musical numbers and the songs of the king are often used for amusing montages.  This is also one of the funniest Disney films I have ever seen.  Lilo gets all of the best lines with her deadpan and childlike innocence in her delivery of her bizarre and sometimes disturbing humor.  Meanwhile, Stitch gets all of best visual gags and physical humor. Some of the funniest moments are: Stitch frequently becoming frustrated and destroying everything he touches, the Elvis montage where Lilo teaches Stitch to become a model citizen like her hero Elvis Presley, some of Lilo and Nani's sisterly quarrels (they fight like real siblings), the exchange of dialogue in a scene where Stitch and Jumba toss back and forth a plasma cannon that is about to explode, and Stitch driving a gas truck into a volcano to use the explosion to propel him like a jet pack. The jokes and gags come fast and furious throughout the first 40 minutes and reaches an arc of melodrama in the middle followed by the funny and action-packed final third.
Ultimately, Lilo & Stitch is a story about acceptance, redemption, and redefining the concept of family.  This film takes the outdated 50's concept of the nuclear family, throws it out the window and replaces it with the more modern and realistic concept of ""family is where the home is"".",1040774400,5,4919,4.761792452830188

It's real Hawaii, the wonderful, traditional, somewhat anti-tourist place that I remember.
It's scientific fantasy without the endless laser blasts, a family story without the so-called ""traditional"" family, a love story that includes arguing...  In short, it mirrors the lives we lead, but the mirror is forgiving.
Quite a lot for an animation!
And of course, it's full of the King of Rock and Roll, and that ain't bad.
You will read some review here that pan the movie because it features a less than idyllic family scene.  My response is, thank goodness!  I want the audience to raise it's hands if they've never EVER argued with a sibling...Good, no hands.

Next, we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she's not at home. It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.

81953,5,0788832182,"I've always shied away from Disney...maybe cause Bambi and Dumbo always made me cry as a kid (I was born in '73), and because I felt like Disney was lately (80's on) going for a very simplistic kind of plotline, with average animation (do all the girls have to have huge, doe-like, eyes?).
With Lilo & Stitch, a very real, very human plotline comes to life. Lilo and Stitch are basically outcasts (I've always loved the 'underdog' role) who aren't sure where they fit in, in their respective (human, and alien) societies. They have the same misfit outlooks on life, and when Stitch is banished from alien society (the product of a 'mad genetic scientist'), he at first lives up to his reputation of being a character of destruction...but soon becomes a 'lost soul' of sorts...searching for a family to call his own...there are references to the 'Ugly Duckling' story...which I always had a very soft spot for in my youthful heart, and remember crying a lot over this little story...a lost little being looking for acceptance...this is the heart and soul of Lilo & Stitch...
If you find yourself rooting for an underdog, with a little bit of bad manners, this is the story for you. I found myself rooting, laughing, cheering for both characters...there is no finer movie to lift the spirits and make one believe that the underdog can come up and blow everyone away!
And, I dare say, that little Stitch is the cutest animation to come along since Roger Rabbit and Dumbo...truly precious!",1040515200,3,1485,4.75968992248062
81954,5,0788832182,"I thought this was a great film. Lilo is a lonely Hawaian girl, who feeds peanut butter sandwiches to fish, bites and fights another girl and makes friends with experiment 626, a being that is made only for destruction by a ""mad genius"" on another planet.
Experiment 626, of course, is Stitch, who manages to pass himself off as a dog so Lilo and her sister/caretaker Nani, can adopt him. As if adopting an alien destructive force isn't bad enough, Nani must also deal with the social worker that is trying to assure that Lilo is being well take care of by Nani. (The parents have died before the movie starts, so kids are spared that part of the film.)
Aliens are dispatched from Turo to get Stitch back. Mr Bubbles, the social worker, is closing in on Nani, determined to remove Lilo from the home - if the aliens don't get her first. How this plays out and how it is all resolved is a lot of fun to watch, with very little of the terror that sometimes comes along with a Disney movie. (Remember Bambi's mom? I _still_do.)
The dvd has some nice extra features, some deleted scenes, some talks with the creator of the characters (Chris Sanders), how to hula and Wynonna doing an amazing job of singing Elvis (among other things).
This, in my opinion, is one of the best Disney films of all time. I'd advise buying this movie especially if you have a little one at home or you like animation.",1040515200,,1392,4.42023346303502

(Speaking from an artists' perspective, the little blue creature looked sort of like a pokemon rip off and the drawings of Nani and her sister Lilo were too exaggerated for me to enjoy).
Well, I was DEAD WRONG. Lilo and Stitch is a humorous and moving film about the love of a little girl for her pet monster, and the love of her big sister Nani, for the little girl.
This film brings to question, Nature versus Nurture: Stitch is a creature created to 'destroy worlds,' who is born 'bad.' Through the love of his human adopted family, he learns the values of caring and responsibility.  Even thought the antics of Stitch and Lilo were amusing, the true hero of this movie is actually Nani. Nani works very hard to do everything she can to procure a job and save her sister. Unfortunately, Stitch and Lilo thwart her at every turn, with (at times) disastrous consequences.
Again, speaking as an artist, some of the character designs were too exaggerated for me to enjoy fully. Particularly the way the noses were drawn, and some of the disproportionate large heads, were incongruous with the rest of the work.
On a positive note,  I REALLY loved the way water was drawn, and the water-color backgrounds were beautiful. Also, Nani and her boyfriend David were well-animated.

A social worker is trying to take Lilo from her sister's care and is not happy with the addition of Stitch to the family.  To make matters worse, aliens have been sent to recapture Stitch.  The little monster eventually is able to overcome his genetic programming and learn to love his Hawaiian friends while surfing (great scene).
The animation and music are one-of-a-kind.  Lilo is adorable and the hula dancing is incredibly lifelike.  The songs, with backup by a children's choir, are in Hawaiian and help to complete the effect.  Tia Carrere even voices the character of Nani.
The extra features kept me laughing.  You can Stitch replacing several characters throughout Disney history, such as Lady in the familiar spaghetti scene from ""Lady and the Tramp"" or Simba in the ""Lion King"".  There are featurettes on the wonderful children's choir that sang in the movie, and how the animators drew the hula dance so well.  A mini-encyclopedia on the state of Hawaii and a trivia game are also nice touches.

Great entertainment in an original story that is appropriate for the 21-st century.  There is no white, middle-class family.  Instead, a ""broken family"" with a social worker (and a few aliens).

Yes, yes, little girl tames wild beast, but come on.  And the scenes with her sister were downright scary.  The screaming... yes, it is rather reminiscent of many sisterly fights, but do we need to see that in a cartoon?
Disney needs to go back to making the people look real. Why the exaggerated features? Look at Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and Cinderella. Why are those movies still so widely loved? Because of the absolute *artistry* contained within. That would be nice to see from Disney. Move away from the computers and get back to drawing.

Lilo is a precocious, but socially inept young girl, struggling with her parents' absence, and the rejection of fellow classmates.  Nani must fill the roles of mother, father, provider, and big sister/friend.  At the same time, she needs a job, and suffers the unspoken frustration of not being able to care for her own needs and wants.

Lilo is a lonely girl who is from a broken home (the parents are dead and the older sister tries to keep the two together). She is a social outcast who takes solace in her apparently antique collection of Elvis LPs. Her characterization is the most interesting in the whole film; a small child who has distinctly adult attitudes. She adopts a dog, which is really a funky space creature and an outcast in his own right. Stitch is a drooling, snarling genetic mutant that learns from Lilo, the value of himself and the importance of family.
The story line moves away from the standard fairy tale fare that is the cornerstone of Disney films, and follows a dysfunctional family for a change. Indeed, Disney marketing blatantly represented Stitch as the black sheep of the animation family. The Ugly Duckling and the importance of family (""no one is left behind"") are the core themes of the movie, and it does an acceptable job of turning these elements into a happy ending.
The animation is unique in that the figures are roundish, in sort of a Pillsbury Doughboy fashion, and the direct opposite of what Disney did with Hercules. This non-threatening approach to animation helps offset some action scenes that may be scary for younger children. Nevertheless, this is good entertainment for the family, and a must for anyone who wants to see an animated space alien wear an Elvis jumpsuit.",1039564800,6,1549,4.7835820895522385
81985,4,0788832182,"Ohana means Disney Hit
Reviewer: Chris Jarmick from Seattle, WA USA
""Ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind"" is a line you'll hear several times in this funny, warm, good for the family PG rated Disney film. Lilo and Stitch features some fine voice work from Tia Carrere (Wayne's World), David Ogden Stiers (TV's Mash)), Kevin McDonald (Kids In The Hall: Brain Candy),Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Oceans 11) and Daveigh Chase (voice of Lilo).
It is not a typical Disney animated film however. Lilo and Stitch are two sisters (whose parents have died), trying to avoid the social services agent who might have to take Lilo away from the teenaged Stitch.  None of this will upset the small fry very much, but there a few intense emotional scenes that might have a few near tears.
Meanwhile a genetically created monster alien is created on a planet in a galaxy far far away. The Alien 'Stitch' escapes and comes to earth programmed to create lots of malicious mischief. It lands in Hawaii and is befriended by LILO. Aliens soon come to earth looking for the bad STITCH.
The soundtrack consists of Elvis songs, the location is Hawaii, Lilo and her sister are Hawaiin, and not drawn as pencil thin, cover-girl model animated Barbie girls either. They are slightly chunky... nice to see.
STITCH has an edge to him, he's too naughty to be completely loveable.. though he grows on you of course. Think the original Daffy Duck from Warners and you're getting warm.
As an adult, I found the film easy to like, laughing several times, and never feeling I was being dipped in way too much honey
coated maudlin sentimentality.. well through most of it anyway.
Toward the end of the film, the slapstick and cartoonish elements take over and things get a little too silly and unbelievable.. but hey, it's a cartoon geared at kids and it just happens to be so good you'll probably forget that for a lot of it's running time.
DVD IMAGE AND SOUND
Lilo & Stitch is presented in 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen. and the print is clear of any noticeable imperfections. The wide variety of bright colors shine. The Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound Mix isn't quite perfect but you can always hear the dialogue loud and clear and various channels are used appropriately for sound
effects and music.
For a one disc Disney DVD there's a lot of extras here:
DisneyPedia -- The Islands of Hawaii: Learn about the six islands of America's tropical paradis as Nani and Lilo explain the history and some fun facts about the
island.
There's a couple of games the kids will like included.
A Stitch in Time: Is a witty ditty about how STITCH has been a part of Disney for a long time and actually was in such films at Snow White and Seven Dwarfs
etc. Silly fun.
Hula Lesson: Learn to dance an authentic Hawaiian hula dance.
There's a couple of brief behind the scenes featurettes that are fluffy but interesting. There's a slightly more indepth On Location with the Directors 20 minute look
at the making of the film as well. It was shot full-frame to be used on Disney's cable channel as a promo for the film--but it's well done. You get a music video
from the A-Teens of course.
Three Deleted Scenes: These include ""Stitch's Trial,"" ""Gantu Challenges,"" and ""Bedtime Story."" All are presented in rough form
Most are only half completed, consisting of pencil drawings and rough animation.
Theatrical Teaser Trailers: A real treat because STITCH appears inappropriately in them and they're pretty funny. Nice to see Disney folks having fun, even
laughing at themselves a bit.
Bonus Trailers: Eight trailers and promotional spots for different Disney films, DVDs, including an upcoming direct to video ""Stitch"" movie in the works.

81988,5,0788832182,"I saw ""Lilo & Stitch"" in the theatre a week or so after it was released.  Initial marketing from Disney didn't inspire me to want to see it much -- to be honest, it looked like the invasion of ""cute Disney sidekick run amok,"" and the ""cute sidekick critter"" getting his own movie didn't appeal to me.  The addition, the commercial's exclamation of ""cowabunga!"" really turned me off.  But then, fortunately, I caught a ""making of"" short with Chris Sanders.  I decided I did want to see it... and before it left the theatres, I'd managed to drag all my friends to see it with me, too, and recommended it across web boards and email lists across the net.  I saw it seven times in the theatre and pre-ordered the disc as soon as it was available.
The movie itself; well, if you've read the other reviews here, you know the story.  A little alien, who is an illegal genetic experiment by an ""evil genius,"" escapes his captors (who have sentenced him to life on a prison asteroid) and crash-lands on one of the islands of Hawai'i.  There he masquerades as a dog so as to use the little girl who adopts him, Lilo, as a shield to prevent his re-capture.  What he didn't expect -- despite having the brains to ""think faster than super computer"" -- was that he would come to love his little shield, and want not only to love and protect her from his alien pursuers, but also to be a part of her little family; for Lilo is an orphan, and is as exiled and lonely as he himself is.
That Stitch is a mean and nasty creature is a given; his creator, Jumba Jukiba, says right from the start that his ""Experiment 626"" was created as a weapon of mass destruction, an unstoppable machine with no other purpose than to destroy.  But Lilo, who herself is not your run-of-the-mill individual (she studies ""Practical Voodoo"" to punish her ""friends,"" who tease her and exclude her from their play; she feeds a peanut butter sandwich to a fish named ""Pudge"" once a week because he controls the weather; she made her own doll and because the head is too big, she pretends bugs laid eggs in the doll's ears), knows that her ""puppy"" is the right one from her.  She tells him right away, ""You ruin everything you touch.  Why don't you make something?""
Disney doesn't lay it on too thick with this story, and I suspect that is the masterful hand of Chris Sanders in all aspects of its creation.  It's irreverent, but not annoying; it's sweet but not cloying; it's hilarious and silly, but never stupid.  That this alien who was ""never given a higher purpose"" finds one ""all on his own"" is the true moral of the story.  That family is where you find it, and that love is greater than anything, is obvious without being driven home with a hammer.
Lilo is an Elvis fan, so most of the music used in the movie are great Elvis classics -- ""Devil In Disguise,"" ""Stuck On You,"" ""Hound Dog,"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel.""  My only complaint was using a new recording (by country/blues artist Wynonna) of ""Burning Love"" over the final ""year in the life of Stitch & Family"" montage instead of Elvis' magnificent recording, but I guess they wanted a few more original cuts (there is also a cover of ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" over the credits, as well as two brand-new songs) in addition to the nearly all-Elvis soundtrack... but at least Wynonna kicks it into high gear with her cover, and it's growing on me.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" is not a musical -- all the music is made to enhance the story only, used only as background.
The DVD is an overall great buy, as well; containing not only this marvelous film but also a great collection of extras -- lessons in how to do the hula, a study of the islands of Hawai'i, behind-the-scenes with the magnificent Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois, scenes of the vocal recordings with the actors (something that has become my favorite extra on ANY Disney DVD), story and animation development, music videos, and more.
Perhaps I came to love this movie because I've always been a fan of so many of its elements -- animation, Elvis, science fiction -- or maybe it's because I was the sort of child Lilo was -- fanciful, lonely, and excluded -- or perhaps it's all those things and more.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" is a gentle, quiet, timeless little movie (note that Lilo listens to vinyl RECORDS, not to CDs, and there's not a computer in their house), as sweet as it is funny.  Disney needs to remember the times when their movies were more about people and problems than hype and selling merchandise (although for the first time since ""The Lion King"" I went out looking for that merchandise... and found precious little).  Or maybe it's just because it's nice to go to a movie (or rent one, or buy one) and just hear good dialogue telling a good story for a change, and not just special effects and ""wow isn't this technologically advanced"" CG animation.  It's just a good story, and it's so nice to see.",1039305600,10,4883,4.4774774774774775
81989,5,0788832182,"Ok let's face it. Disney cartoons as of late have totally lost the heart and appeal that they once had. Other than the Pixar movies, which don't lack heart or appeal at all Disney hasn't really made a good cartoon since the early 90's! It's sad that as of late Disney has been aiming their cartoons towards a more grown up audience and has featured more grown up looking animation that basically is the only thing good about them. Movies like Snow White, Jungle Book, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, Robin Hood, Bambi are all legendary films that rank up there with movies with real actors/actreses in them and have more heart and appeal than some of those movies. The late 80's saw Disney cartoon come out of a slump with the mega hit, The Little Mermaid. It seemed that basically everything that would follow in the next few years would also be a hit, and they were. Beauty and The Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin all had the feel of the old Disney cartoons. They were going to be those classics for the next generations of familes to enjoy. Sadly after those films it seemed like Disney truly ran out of ideas. The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Pochahauntus, and Moulin were all bombs and were the begingings of Disney's downfall. All of those films seemed to be not totally directed for a child audience and for the first time since The Black Calduron (which happens to be one of my fave. Disney films and the most darkest)a cartoon carried a PG rating which was the given to the huge bomb, Moulin. The somewhat savior of Disney would come with the creation of Pixar. Toy Story was a huge hit, which Disney so badly needed. The sequel went onto to become a huge hit as well. When Pixar created A Bug's Life they had competition with a rip off movie called ANTZ. ANTZ went onto bomb and Pixar was still the champ that was until a little movie called Shrek came out and Disney was left baffeled. Not to be outdone Disney fired back with Monster's Inc. which had just as much impact as Toy Story did but sadly it didn't do as well as Shrek but did better than Shrek's follow up, Ice Age (which is pretty good I might add). Two summer's ago Disney took a huge risk with Atlantis. Atlantis looked like no other Disney cartoon and got the PG rating. Disney's risk failed and once again has failed with the newly released, Treasure Planet. Inbetween those releases though the savior of Disney cartoons was release. Lilo and Stitch has the feel of a old beloved Disney classic with a bit of the Pixar films humor. Sadly the movie didn't do as well as expected even with the cutest Disney character, Stitch and to many was another failed attempt to regain old glory but to me it wasn't. This is by far in my opinion the best Disney film of all time. Anytime a film brings tears to my eyes (and i'm a 24 year old guy)there is something special about it. This reminded me in many way of a cartoon version of E.T. or A.I., both of which brought tears to my eyes and in my opinion are two of the best films in movie history. Lilo and Stitch is like nothing else Disney has done before but it still has that classic feel. I saw that someone said they liked this film but wished that they were a little kid. When I was watching this film I did feel like a little kid again and that's something that Disney only does with Pixar films nowadays to me. If you're scared away for some reason to the recent Disney movies for whatever reason please don't miss this film. This film is just as important to the Disney legacy as Snow White, The Little Mermaid and, Beauty And The Beast The Lion King are. It may have not done well in the theater (only the Pixar films do these days)but i'm willing to bet that when you rent or buy this film you will regret not seeing this film in the theater because it's one of those movies you'll remember. I was lucky enough to see E.T. snd Return Of The Jedi in the theater back in the early 80's and both are two of my fave. movies of all time (i've collected Star Wars merch ever since I was little). I'm thankful for seeing those back then but sadly missed out on Lilo and Stitch in the theater and feel that if I did go to see it theatrically that it would give me the same memories like E.T. and Jedi did over some 20 years ago.",1039305600,3,4242,4.297128589263421

Stitch is his name.  Originally designed as a genetic experiment, Stitch escapes from his captivity and lands on Earth, only to become the pet 'dog' of a lonely little girl named Lilo.
This is definitely a Disney classic, and has earned its place among the other great films they have turned out over the years.  The extras on this DVD are great--don't forget to watch the theatrical trailers that show Stitch abusing some of the other well-known Disney characters.  It's very funny.  Lilo and Stich is a great addition to any animated film collection.",1039305600,,725,4.669291338582677
81991,4,0788832182,"Lilo and Stitch is a lively, funny animated movie from Walt Disney Pictures. The animation is not done in the lavish style often associated with Disney. The movie has more of a Cartoon Network look to it. This visual mode fits perfectly with the delightful, ditzy and happily subversive story of an unhappy little Hawaiian girl who befriends an equally miserable creature from another planet.
Stitch is banished from his home planet to a deserted asteroid for good reason - hes a mean little critter who was hatched in a test tube. Clever Stitch manages to escape to Earth, where he crash lands in Hawaii. The authorities from back home are in hot pursuit. While hiding out in a local dog shelter, he is adopted by the rebellious, maladjusted Lilo, who takes to him even though hes the ugliest dog ever. At first Stitch does everything he can to wreak havoc on his new owner, her sister and everyone else who comes near him. Over time, though, he and Lilo establish a bond based on their mutual loneliness, which, for Lilo, is caused by the recent loss of her parents and, for, Stitch, by the fact that he never had any.
The movie covers familiar ground  the importance of friendship, loyalty, etc., but it does so in a fun, spirited, and never preachy way. Its a movie that many adults will find entertaining because its hip and doesnt ram the cute factor down ones throat. Children will be delighted because the movie operates equally well on their level. Lilo and Stitch is great family entertainment.",1039219200,5,1504,4.675471698113207

What a boring world it would be were we all to agree an everything, but this person (whatever gender) is way, way out of line. Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but this review is so offbase and borders on complete lunacy. Not one word was coherent, accurate or in any way representative of what the movie was about or what the writers intended to convey; which, IMHO, they did superbly. This reviewer needs to stick to hard, accurate dramatic movies and avoid anything that even remotely smacks of fantasy, intelligence, kindness, love, heart and wildly unique adventure, all of which this movie possesses in abundance. I loathe the taciturn, negative spin this person put on this new classic and  resented even more the hubris that was so evident throughout the ""review.""  We live in a time when there is a plethora of disasters, horrors and calamities; if this movie, by virtue of it excellence, can transport us from our worlds and bring us to a beautiful place, then so much the better, and the people who worked so hard on this movie have attained their goal and brought a great deal of happiness and joy to those of us who appreciated the fine artwork and unique story presented for your pleasure, not for the censure of some lone malcontent. I make no apologies for my apparent bias and anger at this one review; I must also have my say and urge those who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing this movie, to please do so and then judge for yourselves how much validity and accuracy this ""storyboarder"" has...I suggest he/she stay home and watch CNN 24 hours a day 7 days a week and let us choose to escape and enjoy ourselves, if only for a brief time, and reserve his/her vituperative verbal vomit for more deserving subjects, than this gentle, kind-hearted and beautifully rendered film...we all need some fantasy and beauty in our lives.",1039046400,6,2019,4.621169916434541
81993,5,0788832182,"""Lilo and Stitch"" is my favorite Disney movie.  That is cool that the Director and the voice of Stitch (Chris Sanders)  Made this movie and came up with the idea for Stitch.  This movie is way different from all the other Disney movies.  The DVD is great, but it doesn't have the part where Stitch says: ""I'm not soft and fluffy.""  I don't know what is my favorite part.  Maybe the part where Lilo teaches Stitch how to Hula!  Or where Stitch picks up the car and says ""Blue Punch Buggy!""  Or where Stitch says: ""I like fluffy!"" Or where he says: ""Also cute and fluffy!""",1039046400,,570,4.311320754716981
81994,5,0788832182,"Trust me, parents, Lilo & Stitch is a treat. This is one to own. It is an adventure across the galaxy.  It is a lighthearted tale of a fuzzy little anti-hero and moral lessons learned. It is a spectacular watercolor.  It is a celebration of the beautiful Hawaiin islands and their culture.  It is the best animated Disney summer blockbuster since the Lion King.
Stitch is Experiment 626, an alien designed to wreak destruction and chaos.  He is a little too good at havoc  so good that the Council has decided that he is too dangerous for their society.  Before they can exile him on an asteroid, he escapes his makers and takes refuge on Earth (which is a wildlife reserve where his pursuers must capture him without harming the locals or making a scene).  There he takes up with Lilo, a cute little Hawaiian girl with behavioral problems of her own.  Pretty soon they become an adorable pair of holy terrors around town while bounty hunters lie in wait for an opportunity to reclaim Stitch.
At first I was skeptical that Lilo & Stitch could be any good after a string of box-office bombs from Disney in the last 6 years.  Well, whatever creative slump they were in, the writers and creative forces have redeemed themselves at last.  Returning to a softer visual style with vivid watercolors and rounded designs seems to have worked well with the peppy little story here.  Stitch himself is just too cute, despite naughty hijinks aplenty.  And even though there is a sentimental steak running through the film a mile wide, I never once found myself wishing for that bucket.
The DVD version has some fun bonus material, including deleted scenes which have some delightful raw sketches in areas, as though a ghostly afterimage was infused with life and action. Dont miss the trailers (the Aladdin version is a hoot).  There is an educational bit about Hawaii and Hula dancing included, and we are treated to a behind-the-scenes making of the film through all stages.  Finally, a DVD rom game is waiting.  Dont be afraid to buy this DVD, it is sure to return your moneys worth in entertainment.",1039046400,,2092,4.693150684931507

81996,5,0788832182,"I won't bore you with yet another summary of the movie itself - even if you haven't seen it, you're probably familiar enough with the plot from numerous Disney adds in the past year, and if you're not, there are (as of this writing) 160 other reviews that will undoubtedly break the plot down for you.  Instead, I want to look at the DVD itself and the type of movie (and DVD) Disney has made here.
First of all, the DVD is excellent - the picture and sound are wonderful and the extras for both adults and kids are surprisingly good.  For kids, the main extras are a ""DisneyPedia"" of Hawaii - a focus on the six biggest islands of the chain with a talk about various aspects of Hawaiian culture and nature prominent for each island, the ""Create Your Own Experiment Game"" - essentially a quiz on the movie narrated by David Ogden Steir's Jumba, a faux ""Stitch Through the Years"" documentary, and the ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You"" music video, as well as the usual DVD-ROM links.  It's not jam-packed, but it's pretty decent for something that's on one disc and doesn't have ""Special Edition"" stamped across it in big, bold letters.  For adults, there are behind-the-scenes documentaries on the making of the film, the Hawaiian music from Kamehameha Schools, animating the hula and a half-and-half music video/behind-the-scenes look at Wynonna Judd's rendition of ""Burning Love"".  There are also half-finished deleted and alternate scenes (three in all, with lead-in commentary) and (my personal favorite) the four ""Stitch Invades Other Disney Movies"" teaser trailers.  When put together, it makes for a really excellent DVD on Disney's part.
As for the movie itself, it's the best one they've done since at least ""Pocahontas"" and probably since ""Aladdin"" - it's got an excellent offbeat humor to it, it hits the right moral notes without descending into preachiness.  Likewise, it shows Hawai'i surprisingly effectively.  By having all the action on Kaua'i (the next island northwest from O'ahu) and The Big Island, they bypass Honolulu and much of the touristiness of the islands (although they do give tourists the occasional sardonic nod) in favor of the color, diversity and open acceptance that Hawai'i is, more often than not, known for.  Likewise, while staying firmly rooted in the silly, it strikes a very impressive balance between care and humor that seems to be harder to find with each passing year's new Disney movie.
I really can't recommend this DVD enough.  Along with the quality of the movie itself, it's got a really impressive slew of extras.  Hopefully Disney can take a message from this movie that you don't need to threaten a limited shelf-life, plaster words like ""Uber-Diamond Edition"" across the packaging, or stick it in a limited edition tin to sell a good product.  Whether or not you've seen it, it's worth owning, and - for the price - it's the best DVD Disney's done so far.",1038960000,7,2918,4.849094567404427
81997,5,0788832182,"I saw 'Lilo & Stitch' tonight for the first  time and spent most of the film breathless with laughter.  Here is a Disney film that honors the Disney traditions of Innocence and The Big World without resorting to the skateboard and street-slang treatment of some of its more recent fare.
Fans of Chuck Jones' animation will be enormously gratified at the film's wit, humor and impeccable timing and, unlike some of the other  viewers, I found the moral of the story not heavy-handed, but rather dealt with in unexpected ways with surprisingly honest and often clever dialogue.  It is also a film of enormous heart, more like the kind of film Disney used to make long ago (before their sequel franchise became their focus),  and is one of the few Disney films of the last decade that is both contemporary and timeless.  Kudos to both directors and the artists that made it.
I rented this tonight, and am heading out to buy my own copy tomorrow.  I'm kicking myself for not seeing it at the cinema.  I promise you'll enjoy it.",1038960000,2,1023,4.613259668508287
81998,5,0788832182,"Lilo & Stitch is quickly becoming one of my favorite movies.  It will undoubtedly gain popularity as I'm sure straight to DVD/VHS movies will follow and I can't wait.  This is so much fun for everyone in the whole family.  Heck, I'm 22 years old and I love it.
The music is probably my favorite thing about it.  Not only is Lilo a virtual Elvis Presly expert, but it's perfect that the home of ""Blue Hawaii"" be the setting.  The songs are some of his best and they are superbly woven into the story.  I love the island music and the accurate and respectful treatment of of the legendary hula dance.  It is so much fun to hear this toe tapping music with infectious rhythms.  I have the soundtrack and it is ESSENTIAL summer music.  I love cranking up Hawaiian Roller Coster Ride and rolling down all the windows.
The voices are perfect.  Daveigh Chase is so adorable.  Tia Carrere is the perfect voice to put to Nani, they're practically twins.  Jason Scott Lee is great as David.  His character and Jason's voice go together like pieces of a puzzle.  Kevin McDonald as Pleakly is hilarious.  I loved him on The Kids In The Hall and I love him even more as that goofy alien.  David Ogden Stiers is stellar in the role of Jumba.  He is a big cuddly alien, though evil genius he may be, but he's so funny, especially when Stitch is ""very persuasive.""  Finally, who else could you hear as Cobra Bubbles than Ving Rhames after seeing him on screen.
The water colors for background and just about everything is so fitting with the setting in Hawaii.  The sky is so beautiful and it's just like looking at a great big painting, an ever changing always moving painting.  This could easily have been made digital as is every other animated movie today.  But thankfully, the rounded characters and the all hand drawn and water color utilization is a nice throwback to the classic cartoons of old.
The extra features are great and plentiful.  The explanations for deleted scenes is nice.  The create your own alien game is fun even for someone twenty two like me.  The learning to hula featurette is very interesting and enlightening.  The sing along with Wynona and A-Teens featurette and video are fun.  I love the mock trailers with recent Disney films and the ""Stitch Through the Years"" is cute.  This is an excellent DVD if you are a fan of getting lots of bonus features with your purchase.
The story is great.  It's full of comedy and action and adventure and drama and suspense and romance thought the end looks bleek for Stitch and Ohana, it has a very happy ending that everyone can enjoy.  It is the most original and unconventional Disney film since Toy Story.  It's characers are lovable and memorable.  The music is great.  The picture is great.  The voices makes sense with their characters.  I love this movie and give it my highest recommendation.  It is appealing to young and old, sense of humor or not, lovers of animation or science fiction.  Stitch is going to be the next great enduring Disney character you won't be able to get away from.  Once again, this, one of my favorite films, one of the most entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family in A LONG TIME, get's my highest possible recommendation.",1038873600,,3219,4.564685314685315

82000,5,0788832182,"First of all, please forgive me for going on in this review like I'm writing a college essay - the film is light and fun, and I don't want you to get the impression that it is anything less. I just want to answer the charge that no thought has gone into the issues covered in the film, or that the film indulges in meanness for the sake of a cheap laugh. This is not an attack on the reviewer that made the review I disagree with, but an explanation of why I disagree with the reviewer's points. I've never answered a review directly before, but I liked this film, and feel that the review by ""storyboarder"" elsewhere on this review page (who no doubt makes points that others agree with) was a little unfair, and that maybe the reviewer and others aren't reading between the lines as well as they should if they're truly choosing to hold this film to its apparent themes as rigorously as they claim.
The film did indeed take on a weighty subject as the reviewer says, but I don't agree it was handled lightly - grief is implied, not ignored. We don't need to be shown in a Disney film how people react to grief, and to expect Disney to explain the concept of the death of a parent to children is unfair... Disney is in the business of giving us and our children entertainment. Penny in ""The Rescuers"" was an orphan, but I don't remember anyone expecting a detailed study of how being an orphan affected her present or future life!
The true theme of the story is, in my view, isolation and loneliness, feelings probably experienced and understood by many children at some point in their lives. Stitch was supplied as a different perspective to the same pain - where Lilo and Nani have lost their family, Stitch never had one. Bringing Lilo and Stitch together combines two characters who are natural companions because they both understand what it is to be lonely and isolated, and almost by definition only have each other as true companions, even if they don't realise it.
The film is light in places - it couldn't be ""sad"" all the way through otherwise it would grind on and on, either sending children to sleep or into tears. The characters relieve the tension with plenty of fun moments, such as training Stitch to be more like Elvis, or ""frolicking on the beach"". Who cares where the little Elvis costume came from! I've seen kids on television impersonating Elvis... maybe Lilo bought it from the same place as they did! The fun and companionship in the surfing scene is also a necessary element for Stitch to witness, not just an excuse for a surfing scene, as it shows him what he is rejecting when he fights Lilo's attempts to make him part of her family.
As for meanness in the story or jokes in the film being mean-spirited - well, part of the theme of the film is the redemption of Stitch, just as it is for Ebeneezer Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"", a character who is similarly mean-spirited, and also a parody of himself. As with Scrooge, Stitch's redemption would have no value if he weren't really bad to begin with! The greater the bad, the greater the value of the change to good at the end, and also the greater the goodness of the good characters for putting up with and persisting with the bad one!
""Lilo and Stitch"" is one of the best animated films I've seen in many a long year. It isn't out to force-feed anyone's view of family morality, but is instead a true-to-modern-life story that many, many children will identify with, and also a nice redemption story in it's own right... if it has a fault, it's that the Disney mould for running time is too short for such an original and therefore valuable story, and perhaps it also ends a little too suddenly at the end, as if a better idea for an ending was abandoned at the last minute in favour of a more compact ending.
Chris Sanders, the voice of Stitch, is the person who came up with the idea of the story, did the original design drawings, contributed to the writing of the story, and also co-directed it along with Dean DeBlois. It is my hope that here is another great like Don Bluth in the making (and perhaps a Gary Goldman in Dean DeBlois). I will be watching out for their names in the future.
Well done Disney... I'm only sorry I wasn't able to see this film when I was 8, and had it to enjoy as a childhood memory throughout my life. I'll bet it's a while before we see the like of this film from Disney again. ""Lilo and Stitch""'s unexpected popularity will probably cause it to be seen as a 'winning formula', and see it milked for all its worth, but I hope this first film of any future series manages to stay looking as fresh and original as it is now forever!",1038700800,41,4651,4.409302325581395
82001,5,0788832182,"When I saw this movie advertised as being ""PG"" rated, I couldn't understand why an animated film would labor under such a restriction. On the other hand, considering that almost every Disney animation has its scary bits (think the Wicked Witch in the studio's very first full-length animated feature, ""Snow White""), maybe it's overdue.
Stitch (so named by Lilo, the six-year-old Hawaiian girl who buys him from the State pound under the misapprehension that he's a dog) is really Experiment 626--an intelligent, all-but-invulnerable, six-limbed, blue-furred, keen-eared, grotesque-yet-loveable genetic construct designed as a living war machine (his creator, alien scientist Jumba Jookiba, says he will be inevitably ""attracted to large cities""). Condemned to a prison asteroid by the Galactic Council, he escapes in a stolen police boat and ends up on Earth, hotly pursued by Jumba (paroled for the purpose) and a Council observer, the monocular Pleakley. Here he becomes a member of the ""ohana"" (family in Hawaiian) of Lilo and her big sister/guardian Nani, who are struggling to stay together despite interference from Social Services, while Lilo uses fantasy and acting-out to cope with the apparently very recent accidental death of their parents. Unable to leave the sisters' little island (his molecular structure is too dense to cope with water), and therefore thwarted in his need to find a ""large city,"" he eventually bonds with Lilo (a touching scene occurs in her bedroom when she tells him about her parents and asks if he too has lost loved ones--""I hear you crying in your sleep,"" she says), and after a couple of hilariously failed attempts to be a ""model citizen"" on the order of Lilo's hero, Elvis, he redeems himself by rescuing her after his nemesis, Captain Gantu of the Galactic Space Navy (who resembles a giant whale on two legs), more or less inadvertantly kidnaps her. A delightful montage of ""photographs"" under the closing credits suggests that he and the sisters, with Nani's would-be boyfriend David, social worker and ex-CIA agent Cobra Bubbles, and the two exiled aliens, eventually form an ""ohana,"" with holiday celebrations together, picnics on the beach, and even a trip to the Mainland to visit Graceland.
Some of the aliens, like Jumba and Gantu, may scare the youngest kids, but probably not if they've already seen and enjoyed ""Shrek"" or ""Monsters Inc."" (Others are small and cuddly, resembling beloved stuffed animals.) One very positive alien is Madame President of the Council: though not human or conventionally female in appearance, she's referred to as ""she"" from the beginning, and may remind adult viewers of certain teachers from their past--strict, yet just. The sequence in which David and the girls introduce Stitch to the joys of surfing is particularly well done, and the pursuit of Gantu in his small spaceboat by Nani, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley in a bigger one, is full of thrills and thunderous background music. There are plentiful humorous bits, like Jumba and Pleakley's attempts to blend into the background and the denouement of Bubbles's past. I would personally have preferred more Hawaiian and original music in the score and less Elvis, but that's a personal quirk.",1038614400,10,3232,5.181644359464627
82002,5,0788832182,"I love Disney films, in general, but would not go out of my way to write a review unless the film was beyond superb.  This movie will make you laugh, cry, and bring out emotions that surprise you-- for adults as well as children.  At the outset of the film, the alien nation is a little weird and I was certain, based upon the depiction of Stitch at that point in the movie, that I could NOT come to love him in any way, shape, or form.  Boy, was I wrong.  Disney takes an otherwise grotesque alien and makes him a lovable creature you WANT to own too.  And they take a snotty little girl and give her SUCH human qualities (the scenes with her sister early in the movie are HILARIOUS because they are true-to-form for any 5 year old-- I'm a kindergarten teacher- I know all about it) that you want her to be able to keep Stitch and stay with her (a little misguided and young) sister at the movie's end.  All in all, the movie is a heart-tugger and it WILL touch you even if you don't like warm and fuzzy movies.

I personally like it for the theme, the Elvis music, and the way the characters seem so ""normal"" in comparison to fairytales.  Yet, even with the real world theme, they bring in an alien and lighten the movie up with it, adding flare and comedy.  It's definately one of the best Disney movies ever made, especially because they went out on a limb a little and loosened up...used words like ""stupid head"" and small amounts of violence...it made me feel like my daughter wasn't getting a warped version of things for once, even with the singing alien!
Also, the plot seems to help children who are from dysfunctional backgrounds, and may not relate to a fairytale.  These children need something to relate to and this movie can definately provide that for them.
My daughter liked it because of the ""cute"" Stitch and the fact that it was staged in Hawaii, one of her favorite places.

The last few efforts; ""The Emporer's New Groove"", ""Tarzan"" and ""Atlantis"" were not Disney's best, despite the reciepts.
I don't know why, nor do I claim to know enough to speculate.
That's why ""Lilo & Stich"" was such a happy surprise.
A Hawaiian girl and her sister, struggling within the states Social Services to stay together despite many pitfalls (they lost thier parents in a car accident), end up involved with an escaped experiment from a distant galaxy. This creature was designed to have no guilt or remorse while rampaging. However, when it was supposed to be sent into exile on a deserted planet it escapes to Earth, a planet considered a Wildlife Preserve for skeeters by the galactic community. Along the way, it learns the concept of family and belonging.
This could have been a bad movie. It WAS in production limbo for quite a while. However, someone saw the film for it's originality and cut it loose. With minimal promotion, it went on to become a huge winner for Disney.
Never too slow, never too preachy and having enough humor for adults to appreciate without being gross, this is indeed a family film.

It does it all and more in Lilo & Stitch. This is the first Disney movie since The Lion King to inspire that deep-down connection that we yearn for and find very seldom anymore in me. The Hawaiian ambience is beautifully rendered with music and the watercolor backgrounds, and shows that it isn't idyllic in paradise, with Nani desperately trying to hold down a job and support her problematic little sister Lilo. Then enter Stitch, aka Experiment 626, a bio-engineered alien lifeform programmed to destroy. Escaping from exile on an asteroid belt, he crashlands on Hawaii, where he is taken in to an animal shelter--and adopted by Lilo. Meanwhile, the scientist that created Stitch and an alien Earth enthusiast are sent to reclaim the experiment. It is action-packed, but the story is cohesive and drags you in.

It asks a very serious (though expertly disguised behind beautiful watercolor animation and a great deal of very funny scenes) question--what does it means to be part of a family. Its answer: unconditional love between, and mutual responsbility to, each other.
A truly wonderful film.",1037491200,4,471,5.2105263157894735
82020,4,0788832182,"My husband grew up on Maui and remembers with great fondness what it was like growing up with the Aloha feeling in the air. This movie was able to bring that all back to him. I was about to cry during a very poignant moment in the movie and turned to him for comfort only to find that he was crying. I had to be the strong one! It would be wonderful for more people to understand the feeling of Aloha and how important it is to be ohana.
The movie is well done and beautifully animated. The characters reminded my husband of people he grew up with . The body shapes of the characters were very stereotypical of the native Hawaiians. These were real people, not some fantasy image that no one could relate to.
I look forward to sharing this one with my children. I want them to know that they are ohana--family.",1037404800,3,810,4.232258064516129
82021,5,0788832182,"Personally I loved this movie so much because it's very different from all the Disney stories I've watched since I was a little girl. It offers a contemporary look to issues like science and family values, so important for our society. Also like any of the main characters we can laugh and cry with them while watching the movie. Sincerely it's a beautiful movie full of good things to think about.",1037059200,2,398,4.619718309859155
82022,5,0788832182,"I went to see Lilo & Stitch expecting a cutesy movie about a spunky Hawaiian child and her alien pal.  It turned out to be a  touching story about what it means to be family.  It takes the fanciful story of an alien coming to Earth and uses it to discuss death in a family, children acting out, the struggle of low income families to stay together, and love.
I sincerely hope Disney continues to help children peek into other cultures in this way.  A child from the inner city of New York can identify with the messages in this movie while learning about an entirely different culture.  It is literally doing us a ""world"" of good.  I will definitely purchase this movie.",1037059200,4,670,4.40650406504065
82023,5,0788832182,One of the best animated films in some time. This should become a classic. A whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on.,1036195200,2,107,5.75
82034,5,0788832182,"It is a shame that this superior Disney product was put against the lackluster ""Scooby Doo Movie"" and had to fight it out for attention.  If you really want to do yourself and your kids a favor, toss out those discount coupons you got for ""Scooby Doo"" and spend full retail on this.
Lilo is a lonely, misunderstood (I won't tell why) girl from Hawaii who needs companionship, a friend, and whose family is hanging on by a thread and being threatened to be torn apart by Social Services (whose agent is a cross between Mr. T and a Man in Black).
She finds, through a series of mishaps, a wonderful pet named ""Stich"" who also needs some help.  The help Stich needs is way beyond what Lilo can give him- - - at first.
Lilo and her sister love each other, Lilo finds love for Stich and Stich doesn't know what love or family really is.
If you want a film that mixes laughter, a real solid feeling for family, some great (and well placed) Elvis toons, and a big helping of Science Fiction please get this.
It's not the Disney needs the money. It's that you need the story that this movie tells.",1035763200,3,1089,4.307317073170732
82035,1,0788832182,"Oh wow. Where to start?  It's like Wack-A-Mole at Chucky Cheese.  So many moles, so few mallets.  This movie is singularly the most cruel movie I've seen in the past dozen years.  It's Animal Farm with a bad Hawaiian soundtrack and no sense of humor. It's so bad, I have to talk in broken sentences, like a punch-drunk boxer who lost the last round on a technicality.  Wait - I am getting a sense of how the story-board at Disney went!! Happy-go-lucky, destructive beastie does not fit in to society.  Moons government authority figure.  Audience giggles, nods in understanding that he must be banished.  Can't be productive member of higher society.  Only an evil scientist likes it. Stitch is only redeemed when he learns to appreciate family, and get along with everybody else. Children taught valuable lesson about what happens when authority figures go unheeded. Estrangement, banishment, righteous indignation - Bad musical interludes will be your fate if you do not find your right place in Society. See, everybody really wants to ""be like folks"", right? We all wanna be the SAME, don't we?  We wanna FIT IN and FIND OUR PLACE in the world. Oh sure, Stitch can be crazy and wacky and creatively independant (for the first half of his life), but when it gets right down to it, he's a sorry, needy squid like the rest of the modern world.  Stitch is on his knees begging for Family before the One-Hour mark in the movie, spittling the movie's theme line just in CASE you missed the point when it was said for the previous 87 times.  Ohana means Family.  Of course, it's not really about family - it's about conformity (maybe that's what family is about these days, too - who knows?).  It's about finding a group and blending in.  Disney tells us about freedom - the freedom to be like everyone else or be excoriated.  Excuse me, but I'd rather cozy up to ""Dude Where's My Car"" while being pelted with rocks than ever have to subject myself to this trite, insidious piece of propaganda again.  If I wanted trashy propaganda, I'd watch Triumph of the Will - at least then the fascists would be easily spotted.  Today, they apparently sometimes have mouse ears and cute fuzzy voices.",1034899200,11,2185,4.675392670157068
82036,5,0788832182,"This is a simply magnificent movie. I've seen it in the theater 4 times so far and have cried my way through it each time. I was not born in Hawaii, but lived there for more than 20 years. The film's creators' respect and love for Hawaii, its people, and its traditions are very evident. Stitch will tug at your heartstrings. Who among us has not felt left alone, wanting love? As for you who coldly condemn any family structure other than the one you approve of, consider the fact that some of us may not want that kind of family, or, like Lilo and Nani, might have lost the one we had.
In my opinion, apart from the sheer entertainment and humor, the strongest part of this movie is the message that what truly matters is love and caring and that families can be of any configuration. I also appreciated the un-Hollywood-like portrayal of Nani and the fact that Lilo's personality quirks and problems were not sugar-coated. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1034467200,3,968,4.537142857142857
82037,5,0788832182,"This is quite simply the most imaginative, creative, and fun Disney film in years.  The animation is stunning and beautiful recalling the wonderfully detailed cartoons of 1940' and 50's. Unlike like recent Disney efforts, Lilo and Stitch doesn't just devolve into a series of poorly animated musics videos with all star voices.  This is a classic along the lines of The Iron Giant and the Miyazaki films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke).  The opening sequence featuring Stitch's escape in an absolutely hilarious masterpiece of animation.  Enjoyable for adults and children with a positive message that isn't forced or overly sentimental.  Far and away more impressive on any level than other highly touted Disney epics like the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast!  One of the finest films of 2002.  A must see!",1033862400,3,832,5.118518518518519
82038,5,0788832182,"Last night I watched this film and really think it's one of the best Disney features for a long time on the grounds of depth, originality and animation.
The plot is very strong and they [Disney], at last, tackle some very sensitive issues without ambiguity.
I was surprised by the completely different approach to family aspect in the film and was considerably engaged by many moments in the film. For the first time in cinema, I felt like I wanted to applaud at the end.
Still shocked by how much this film means to me.
Themes play on your mind - like a very good play by Brecht or Orton, you walk out entertained but also educated.
This DVD is one of two versions - Disney plan to release a Special Edition two months later. Maybe we should hold on and wait for it.",1033862400,,767,4.333333333333333
82039,5,0788832182,"Here we have one of the funniest, most creative and original, and genuinely emotional animated films that has EVER been created, and this pretentious ""Watchman-on-the-Wall"" person has the nerve to put it down for elements that don't even figure into it.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" is the only movie I have ever seen that makes me cry literally from beginning to end; half the time because it's just that charming and funny, and the other half the time because the themes of love, loyalty, and family are SO beautifully and tenderly conveyed.  Right from the film's opening credits sequence you will surely have tears in your eyes from the sheer beauty of the Hawaiian musical numbers and the open affection of the filmmakers for the Hawaiian culture.  On a character note, Lilo has perhaps more depth than any animated character I've ever seen.  Her eccentricities and emotional baggage make her, by turns, delightfully charming and totally heartbreaking.  Stitch is, hands-down, the most original and entertaining animated character I have EVER seen, and so long as he is on the screen, I am having the BEST time with all of his fantastically wonderful random movements and noises.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" also deserves kudos for having the courage to be so modern in its handling of such important real-life issues as broken familes and Departments of Child Welfare.  This is an absolutely brilliant and deeply moving little film that deserves FAR better than the lazy, cheesy direct-to-video sequel and TV series that are already in the works, and my only wish at this point is that Disney would treat their finest properties with enough reverence and respect to give them the better-thought-out *theatrical* sequel treatment they so strongly deserve.  I may not pay much attention to the forthcoming direct-to-video ""Stitch: The Movie,"" but ""Lilo & Stitch"" is one movie that I personally cannot WAIT to add to my personal DVD collection... it has entertained and moved me more thoroughly than any other movie I have had the privelige of seeing this year!

This review had to be broken down into two parts: The first half starting out as more of a call to attention for many of the ''adults'' who have expressed a number of ''concerns'' about the Disney production, ''LILO & STITCH.''
* [Part I] * ~
For those parents who are complaining about certain ""unwholesome content"" of this animated feature (disrespectful attitudes, the ''midriffs,'' the violence, the intensity, the tendency to scare small children, etc.), I offer a simple suggestion: Just deal with it and get over it, because it's ALL ''YOUR'' FAULT for allowing your young children to view this film in the first place BEFORE having done your homework!
In case all of you supposedly 'moral purists' had not noticed, ''LILO & STITCH'' was given a *''PG''* MPAA Rating!
That's ''PG,'' as in ''Parental Guidance Suggested'' -- wherein the subtitle bar reads:
''Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children.'' ... Get It?
If anyone is unclear as to what movie ratings mean or reveal about a film's contents and what it suggests to ''concerned parents,'' I recommend that you learn all about it at the official film ratings web site at ''mpaa .org'' and they'll teach you all about it.
Also, for those parents complaining about the content their children are being exposed to in this or any film, ''screenit .com'' is a service which will tell you *EVERYTHING* you need know (the good, the bad and the ugly) about what to expect in a movie or video BEFORE showing it to your 'precious little angels.'
So please, EXERCISE SOME PARENTAL 'RESPONSIBILITY,' STOP MAKING 'EXCUSES' and QUIT PASSING THE 'BLAME'! As several poo-pooers have already suggested, go see ''SPIRIT'' instead, if you want something strictly for the kidlets and/or if you DON'T want to take responsibility for what they see in the movie theatre ... and leave ''LILO & STITCH'' for the REST of us!
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
*[Part II]* ~
With that all said, There's not much more I can add to the praise which has already been heaped upon this daring Disney film, except this:
''LILO & STITCH'' is the first and only Disney animated feature film I have ever found interesting enough for me to consider breaking my [literally] lifelong personal boycott against Disney animated feature films! (And this is no lie ... all anyone would ever need to do is ask my mother how many Disney movies I've ever begged her to take me to.) One could probably call the Live-Action/CGI amalgam ''TRON'' the only exception (though it was really not a Disney production at all, but an independent film project Disney purchased when no other studio would touch it, and to Disney's great credit, they had enough foresight to see just how visionary the project was and understood the importance and future impact of the then new technology).
Admittedly, my initial interest in this new feature was the fact that the story is set in my home state of Hawaii. Added incentives included no operatic arias, no dancing refrigerators, no diabetic system-shocking hyper-saccharin syrupy sweetness, and no talking animals ... except for Stitch, of course. When I learned those things about the film, and learned that the underlying theme of the film was ''Ohana,'' I just had to let my curiosity dictate. And though I wouldn't place ''Lilo & Stitch'' anywhere on the same level as with the Warner Bros. feature ''THE IRON GIANT,'' I was still thoroughly satisfied and found myself VERY impressed with it -- enough to want to place myself on the 'new release notification' list, pending the release of the DVD, which I DO intend on purchasing upon availability. I also appreciated the limited use of CGI, as I have a difficult time relating to the visual clashing which often takes place whenever CGI is incorporated into cel animation.
Again, I cannot add much more positive to what so many have already said, but considering that an adamant lifelong ''Anti-Disneyite'' can so willingly and freely do something he'd sworn he'd never do even in a jillionbillion years-- heap praise on a Disney animated feature film --should be considered a very positive sign, indeed!
American animation has clearly been growing up in the past few years, and it looks as if Disney may have finally reached its puberty stage. That's a good thing, and it's about time.
