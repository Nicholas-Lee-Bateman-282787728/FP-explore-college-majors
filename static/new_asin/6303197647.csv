593222,5,6303197647,"For anyone interested in human consiousness, psychology, botany (study of plants), and for anyone who likes psychoactive plats.  Awesome speaker I have watched this 5 times!  I showed all my friends, this is like no other movie out there, cannot explain you must watch it, and pay attention to what he says.  This is my new favorite movie!",1053648000,4,339,4.810344827586207

A true multimedia implosion of structures. Weird? yes. Entertaining? definitely.",1043107200,2,141,6.888888888888889
7840745,5,6303197647,How can you not love Terence McKenna?!? This is a must have.,1490745600,,60,4.083333333333333
7840746,5,6303197647,"I'll keep this short. This video is a mind-warping piece of cinematography dominated by Terence McKenna's oratory prowess. you may not agree with his speculations and even find him to be outlandish, but you are drawn in and forced to listen to him anyway because he is so compelling. He talks about his psychedelic excursions with an extremely powerful drug - DMT, but that is not the gist of the subject matter. He doesn't go on and on about it. He references it to explain Shamanism. The real point of the video is how we have lost touch with our human-ness and what we must do to get it back. I've read 3 of his books and seen much video and blog on him. I'm always fascinated by his take on humanity and the world. I personally see him as a visionary teacher and even a saint, shaman, and  genius. The man has a PhD, so if you require something to lend credibility to his  thoughts & musings, his intelligence should be sufficient for you. I recommend him to anybody who will listen. He's not with us on this planet anymore so drink in whatever words he has already spoken.",1282348800,,1077,4.38
7840747,4,6303197647,"I first owned this piece on VHS at the time it was first released, back when I first started to rave, when McKenna was alive, when everything seemed possible. It strikes me now that there should be a cousin event to Rave, called Rant, where psychotic countercultural spokespersons (like ol' Terrence was) are invited before a participatory audience to weave lunatic theories and high-sci lullabies over a wash of circadian EDM for 18 hours at a go. But who would front such an animal, now Uncle Terry's kicked the bucket?
Jonah ""Spacetime"" Sharp is on his A-game, as expected. On the visual front, Rose-X represents in their lamentable style of mixing beautiful, superbly effected film segments with nauseating CG, by virtue of insipid and over-used video-toaster wipes. On the whole, the visual aspect works, but it may grate on the nerves of the discriminating observer. McKenna's voice can be likewise grating, for anyone not familiar with his beloved nasal babble. And Terrence is in fine form for babble. Any fan of his should have this in their collection. This DVD captures a timeless moment of crystalized madness and optimism, like a strange attractor throwing sparks of inspiration back through time to illuminate the minds of those with eyes to see. Psychonauts apply here.",1243987200,,1284,5.032863849765258
7840748,3,6303197647,I thought this was going to be better. The visual effects were not very good. Maybe real out of date by now. Mckenna on his first to rants didn't really make me interested in seeing the complete DVD. I watch the rest of it someday when I'm real bored. I'd pass on this one if I were you.,1213920000,,287,3.9655172413793105
7840749,1,6303197647,"I have listened to the CD of Alien Dreamtime hundreds of times (literally) and this companion video has ruined that cumulative experience. I highly recomend avoiding this DVD if you have heard the CD before as it will taint that experience.

The graphics in the video are very dated and I am sure someone could make a better visual show on their MAC (If you do let me know where to find it!) The sound quality of this Live recording is also not as clean as the CD.

CD = Highly Highly Highly Recomended
DVD = Only after you have listen to the CD and appreciate its content.

I think I purchased this just to add to my McKenna collection.

Sorry for the bad review...",1193270400,4,666,4.304
7840750,4,6303197647,"If at all interested in Terence McKenna, you should probably check this DVD out.  The visuals aren't very complex, but the speech is a classic (on the Archaic Revival).  There is one sequence which features crude, psychedelic images of phallics, which makes me feel uncomfortable on viewing.  I don't understand why it's there.  Anyways, when you get past the phallic scene, it's a classic psychedelic tale set to some decent visuals.",1171497600,,434,5.070422535211268
7840751,1,6303197647,"First off, let me begin by saying that I think Terence McKenna is one of the most important people to come around in the last hundred years or so. If you think this would be a good introduction to what he was all about don't start here. I don't recommend that anyone watch this. What it amounts to is just a bunch of swirling psychedelic images kaleidescoping about while TM riffs over the top with some standard raps of his. I was wanting it to be over by about 7 minutes into it, by then I had discovered it probably wasn't going to get any better. There is not nearly enough Terence here. There are huge streaches where he's not even speaking at all, the images are lame and annoying. You do get to see a semi-nude woman dancing for a while yet no beaver shots....This is a sad substitute for real experience. If you don't have the balls to take 5 grams in silent darkness, alone -like he often recommended - then maybe this movie will make you think that you just had a trip, but don't kid yourself....the contents of your own mind will be far more interesting and insightful than anything you are likely to find here. For a good source of TM audio material, check out the audio archives of rinf.com. You will get the inside scoop from The Man himself with nothing else in the way.",1129161600,11,1285,4.33609958506224
7840752,5,6303197647,"I've been trying to locate info about this movie for years....if you are into exploring your personal realms of being.....or into psychedelics this is for you....You when you try to explain to someone THE experience its practiclly impossible to give the journey justice...Terrence set the mood to the T,....Tune In",1121385600,4,314,5.3
7840753,5,6303197647,"Hopeful, visionary, enlightened, stimulating, mind-expanding media upon which the viewer parks his ego/social games at the door and steps into wonderfully bizarre and edifying territory, indeed.
Works well with ""Male or Female, Primitive Reflections Twisted From Sound.""",1077408000,6,270,6.324324324324325
7840754,5,6303197647,"This dvd is a must have for anyone who trips.  Watch this dvd while your peaking, its got so many visuals with Terence McKenna talking in the backround (this was also made live in san francisco)  There is also a Diggereedoo in the backround (the australian instrument) and it really completes the package.",1063756800,7,305,4.735849056603773
