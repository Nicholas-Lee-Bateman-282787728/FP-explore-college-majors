8169187,3,B000MGVCWW,"The program is interesting, though its restaurant food, and largely ""haute cuisine"" at that.  Watching the cooking parts is pretty null; you get basic English narration with the Chefs just cooking. I think it would have been much, MUCH better if the Chefs had described what the dish is striving for, what they are doing, tips, etc.  I appreciate this would have been in French, but that would have been better, assuming English subtitles could be provided.  I hope the producers will try again  - perhaps with a more bourgeois cooking style focus.",1421625600,,548,4.860215053763441
8169188,3,B000MGVCWW,"Like the other volume, I have already seen this series on TV a long time ago. It is a nostalgia section, but the food remains always appetizing. Nothing like French cuisine to keep you happy and healthy (at least spiritualy).",1395273600,,225,4.65
8169189,5,B000MGVCWW,"This was such a wonderful find... I bought the Cooking French Vol 1 and Vol 2.  It was the greatest combination of travel to the very nicest places in France, along with some of the very best cooking demonstrations by noted chefs.  The French have advanced the culinary arts farther than any other people.  I have never been to France, but would like to visit sometime soon.  I am a gourmet cook at home.  And I wanted to know more about the cuisine of France, so that when I visit, I will know exactly what to order on the menu.  I have to admit that I am somewhat divided.  On one hand, I can appreciate the genius of such amazing complexity and artistic ability of the French.  But on the other hand, my favorite dishes are definately not squid, snails, frog legs, pig's feet and cow's stomach!!  And I was a bit disappointed in that they did not prepare Alsace Tarte Flambee, which is kind of a pizza made with brie cheese, bacon and caramelized onions.  Nor did they make my favorite dessert of all time, the French Napoleon, which is three chewy pastry layers with fresh raspberries and custard filling.  However, the presentation was excellent.  The narrator was an elegant beautiful and refined French woman.  And the scenery and photography was very professionally done.  It gave me a feeling of being there.  And watching the French chefs making such amazing cuisine right before my eyes, was truly like living there in France long enough to become familiar with their finest cultural experience.",1333238400,3,1506,4.673003802281369

8169191,3,B000MGVCWW,"Video Review - Cooking French: The Cuisine of Burgundy and Southern France

First, let me tell you what 'Cooking French: The Cuisine of Burgundy
and Southern France' is not. It is not a how-to-cook video. The video
shows chefs cooking traditional French cuisine, but it is not
specifically instructional. This Travel Channel video series also
features French landmarks and some background information on the
culture. Highlights include the preparation of coq au vin and a
segment on the Beaujolais wine region.

It's nothing to run out to the rental store tonight for, but it may be
worth the time for those interested in learning more about Beaujolais
wines.",1202774400,9,659,5.092592592592593
