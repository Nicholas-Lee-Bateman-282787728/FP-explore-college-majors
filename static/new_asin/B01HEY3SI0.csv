8765305,3,B01HEY3SI0,"I didn't like this one as much as the ""Melancholy"" and ""Disappearance of Haruhi"" installments. There are some funny Kyon moments, but otherwise, I was pretty bored. I hate romantic comedies and got this one knowing full-well this is one. I just expected more, I guess.
I think that this version of Yuki is what I disliked most.",1532563200,,327,4.655172413793103

8765307,4,B01HEY3SI0,A spin-off of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.  This series takes the perspective of Nagato and also in some different dimension where the outcome is a lot different.  Still good slice of life and Haruhi is still energetic than ever.  Can recommend it for fans of that series or some slice of life genre.,1505174400,,306,4.62962962962963

8765310,4,B01HEY3SI0,"It's great, but it cuts off so much sooner than the manga, as well as straying from it further than most anime adaptations of other manga I've seen. Some of it is exactly the same, though, so that's nice. That aside, I LOVE it! It makes all the subtle references you'd expect to be added (such as BGM).",1490054400,,302,4.224137931034483
