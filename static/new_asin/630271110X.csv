500321,5,630271110X,"In 1964 three friends went to the show to see a surf movie for the first time.  We returned to see this movie over and over again, (7 times to be exact).  Being young and impressionable we wanted to be like Fabian, Tab Hunter, and Peter Brown riding Big Waves in Hawaii and falling in ""Love"" with girls like Susan Hart, Shelley Fabares and Barbara Eden.  This movie made our summer of '64 a fantasy summer, we went to the beach, tried to surf,  listened to Jan & Dean, The Beach Boys and dreamt of the girls in ""Ride the Wild Surf"".  By todays standards this movie seems ""Hokie"", but for three fourteen year old boy's in 1964 it was a movie and Summer to remember.",996278400,45,664,4.238095238095238
500322,3,630271110X,"Yes, Fabian cannot act. Yes, Shelley Fabares is a cutie. But it's the surfing footage that makes this film worth watching. No fancy vocab necessary to review this. Just watch it for the surfing: Waimea Beach! The Banzai Pipeline! The 30 ft walls of water! Huge bone-crushing tubes! Some of the best vintage surf footage in a non-documentary film. Also, 1960's teen angst on the beaches of Hawaii is hilarious. We should have had it so tough as teenagers!  Enjoy!!!",992822400,9,464,4.8

500373,4,630271110X,"So, from 1964 we have Fabian, Tab Hunter, Peter Brown and Shelley Fabares (looking awful as a blonde) and Barbara Eden. The boys come to Hawaii from California to ride the biggest waves in the world and in the meantime, each meets the girls of their dreams. This is the trials and tribulations of the boys and girls in the 1960's, should I surf or go back to school or move here or be a beach bum. Nevertheless, I reall did enjoy this movie and I think you will too as long as you understand the era that it was made in. Were the performances stellar? Not so much. In my opinion the best was Peter Brown and he really didn't go on to much more. The girls characters were silly and the boys just kind of stereotypical. Having said the bad I still enjoyed it.",1455235200,,757,4.191780821917808

500413,3,630271110X,"By the time this movie came out, the surf trend was fading, taken over (as was just about everything) by the boys from Liverpool. This film was originally going to feature Jan & Dean in film roles but they were removed over some nonsense regarding a kidnapping hoax of Frank Sinatra Jr. In the end all that was left of J&D involvement was the amazing title song. As is, the choice of cast replacements is questionable. Fabian was deep into his carreer slide. Never that great of a singer, he was even less of an actor. As others have pointed out, this movie is a lot more serious than the Beach Party movies with an actual plot rather than a vague outline to wrap some foolishness around. While certainly not a classic it is nonetheless more than watchable & probably a far better representation of it's times than most any other ""fun & sun"" movie of the mid 60's. All in all a fun but lightweight movie.",1436227200,,904,4.419161676646707

I got worn out watching what I consider to be an excess of mediocre surfing in the fabulous massive waves of Hawaii.  But the movie is CLEAN.  I well remember when girls wore dresses, even to beach events and guys were respectful as they are generally portrayed in this film.  But, I got rather bored with it.  Even the Elvis movies with Shelly Fabares were considerably better than this one.",1428710400,,484,4.5813953488372094
500448,5,630271110X,"A real classic.  Still after all these years and I have seen hundreds of surf films, this one has all of the real elements of the early surf
culture that existed in Hawaii.  Sure it has it has the corny clips of catching the wave that looks stupid, but the story line of the early pioneers going after those waves and their simple life style can been seen today. Of course, now there is big money sponsoring the surfers and Hawaii is only
one of twenty world class big wave spots. I still enjoyed it as much as I did when I was 12 years old.",1428451200,,541,4.09433962264151

They were filming this movie fifty years ago this summer. Kennedy was President, kids still dressed like their parents and Vietnam wasn't a real war yet. This movie freezes that era in time. Check it out...you'll like it!

500639,3,630271110X,"Ride the Wild Surf, 1964 film

The credits roll showing the surf off Hawaii. The season starts in December when surfers arrive to these beaches. Surfboards are planted in the sand like totem poles. The men change into bathing suits in their car, then paddle their long boards out into the ocean. ""Its different from Malibu."" [Long shots suggest body doubles.] Later they watch a judo exhibit. One girl challenges one of the men and wins. She is not a ""girl nut"". Weather reports say a storm is coming. The men discuss this. Chase meets Augusta and talks about college. The talk tells about their characters. One follows the surf. Breeze wants to be a teacher (underpaid and overworked - no unions then). The sound of a siren brings the boys paddling out to catch a wave. Others arrive at the beach. [Note the cars.]

Chase walks from the water with a dry bathing suit. There is a conflict over space on the waves. There is a collision, Frank hits his nose on a board. Lily explains her parents to Ralph; does work come before play? New Year is a time of celebration on the islands. Fireworks light up the night. Another couple view Weiameia Falls. There is a sudden rain and they take refuge in an empty cottage. Jody explains his parents and himself. What will he do? [The monetary figures date this picture.] Big waves cause wipe-outs. Jody was caught in rough waves. At night rockets are launched for fireworks. One girl dances on the beach for applause. So does Lily. The radio says bit waves are coming. That big rocket fizzles out (a ""bomb""). Chase confesses to letting the powder out. Later he talks about jumping off a cliff. Too much to drink? ""Happy New Year!"" The surf is up. Too high?

Ralph meets Lily's Mom. She doesn't like surfers (she married one). Ralph shows her his bankbook, union card, and gold credit card; he spends more time working than surfing. Is that enough? Is Jody a quitter? [Note the slang term ""phony"".] Morning brings surfers to the ocean. They leave by ones or twos. People on the beach watch them. Lily's Mom offers Ralph a new board. Who will be the last man surfing? The conflict with nature and other surfers continues. ""Why don't they quit?"" They call it a draw but Jody goes out again. ""He did it."" Jody has passed his test. The movie lists the actors, and we finally hear the title song by Jan & Dean.

This is one of those movies that seemed much better when I first saw it many years ago. Time (and experience) changes your outlook. I remember that Jan & Dean were supposed to be in this movie but were blacklisted after some in their circle of friends kidnapped and held for ransom the son of a famous and powerful actor and singer. [They made a TV movie about Jan & Dean in the late 1970s.] In real life the War in Vietnam became more influential than the surfing songs of the mid-1960s. These songs told of a carefree life of fun in the sun where there were few worries. The 1950s and 1960s were the best of economic times for the average American. Are those days gone for good?",1340841600,,3026,4.466546112115732

500728,4,630271110X,"This is a review for the 1964 teen flic release, RIDE THE WILD SURF.

RIDE THE WILD SURF is a much better movie than might be thought.
The basic story is a group of young surfers go to Hawaii to ride the
best waves and make a go of having the best surfing safari of all time.
And eventually the best of them wind up in a sort of informal surfing championship that just happens to be on a ""Wide World of Sports"" type show.

I should mention that although there are many teen favorites in the
cast there are also no Frankie and Annette, no Eric Von Zipper and no
fading stars from the classic Hollywood era such as Bob Cummings
and the usually woefully misused Buster Keaton.

Instead we have a cast of young pros doing the best they can,
depending on their various abilities, acting in a pretty much natural
fashion.  Young stars such as Peter Brown (with dyed blonde hair), Fabian,
Jim Mitchum, Barbara Eden, Tab Hunter, Shelley Fabres, Susan Hart and
Roger Davis.

Again, maybe not the greatest actors but in RIDE THE WILD SURF none
of them get in the way or stumble over furniture.

But the best thing about RIDE THE WILD SURF is the cinematography.
Just great shots of surfers looking like action figure miniatures
while being dwarfed by fantastic looking giant waves that look like
they want surfer blood for dinner.

Some extraordinary shots make it easy to see the appeal of the
sport and why so many folks are still involved in it. As someone else
said, this has to be the best non- documentary surfing photography
in a commercial movie.

If you have a chance to see RIDE THE WILD SURF, don't pass it up.
It's a worthwhile film, maybe not for the usual reasons but  I give
it four stars.",1281830400,4,1694,4.403846153846154
500729,2,630271110X,"On the one hand, the movie is an interesting time machine back to ""60's surfer flicks.""  No one swears and there's barely a hint of sex going on.  But it was clearly shot on a tight budget, the writing is often extra bad, and not all of the actors can act.  More music would have helped and there's too much stock surfing footage used. There are however some nice location shots.  The young Barbara Eden seems to be having fun in the film and her character is amusingly loopy.  The other woman in the film looks like they fried her hair into platinum and her hair is gonna crack off of her head any second.  Oh, the 1960's.....",1269820800,4,627,4.271186440677966

Fabian isn't a great actor, but is fun to watch.  Don't like Shelly Fabares with blonde hair, though.",1246233600,,258,3.923076923076923
500733,5,630271110X,"I love this movie. The plot line is more interesting than that of the Frankie/Annette beach movies. 3 guys from California make their dream trip to Hawaii over Christmas vacation to surf the hot spots. All have different life changing experiences in Hawaii that involve a girl, and of course it is all worked out over the course of 10 days.  It is very indicative of the times. Guys surf, girls sit on the beach in a different bikini each day with the big hair do's and NEVER get the swim suits wet. Good group of actors, and Brian Wilson wrote the score and Jan and Dean sing the main song. One of my faves, even with the staged up close ""surfing"" shots.",1237161600,2,655,4.32520325203252
500734,3,630271110X,"The previous reviews about the movie being all about the waves is correct. The plot was quite boring. Definitely, a ""Grade B"" movie. But the waves were quite nice.

500736,4,630271110X,"Loved this show as it typifies the surf 60's scene. What was most impressive to me is the stunning Ms Barbara Eden in one of her most down to earth characters yet. Few people know that Barbara Eden was a Judo expert and she gets a rare chance to show off her skills on this set as she playfully throws her would be boyfriend Chase to the ground after he taunts her abilities. After she humbles him to the ground while keeping him in a judo lock placing her bare foot down upon his face, he finally gives up and learns to also ""lighten up"" for the rest of the show. Overall some great surfing and cool waves, this is a cult classic for everyone who loves a good throwback to the early 60's innocence.",1203552000,8,699,4.185185185185185
500777,3,630271110X,"Definitely a product of its time, if you are the kind of person who could watch people surf for hours then this is the movie for you!

500778,4,630271110X,"Journey back with me to the simplier, more naive time of the early to mid-60's when all young men were supposed to think about was girls in bikini's, surf music and the perfect wave. Released in '64 'Ride the Wild Surf' belonged in that genre of movies that brought teenagers flocking to the theaters in mass. In my estimation it happens to be the best of the bunch, despite the fact that Frankie and Annette are nowhere to be found.

What young girl would want to miss out on seeing Fabian, Tab Hunter and Peter Brown challenging surfings best and the waves of Hawaii in the quest to be the last man surfing. As for the guys, well how about Shelley Fabares, Barbara Eden and Susan Hart to wet you appetite?

Don't be expecting Shakespeare. Be prepared for horribly cliched dialogue poorly delivered, lots of absurd posturing and totally predictable dialogue. It's a hoot!",1195430400,7,872,4.6558441558441555

500780,5,630271110X,"Unlike other beach movies that were typified by silly slapstick buffoonery, muscles and bikinis RIDE THE WILD SURF was the antithesis of such tomfoolery. Still keeping the muscles and bikinis RIDE THE WILD SURF took itself serious and played it straight. Basically three buddies from California (Fabian, Tab Hunter and Peter Brown) travel to Hawaii during school break looking for the challenge of the truly big waves each with own motivations and reasons. They are not alone in their quest and that sets up the dynamics of this good film as they vie not only to be the best but to win the hearts of the three females (Barbara Eden, Shelley Fabares and Susan Hart) who become enamored with them. In their way are other surfers (including James Mitchum and Roger Davis) looking for that perfect wave as well. This all intensifies the competition, develops the camaraderie and shows the true character and sportsmanship of the surfers. Technically the surfing and cinematography are outstanding. Jan & Dean play the title song that stands toe to toe with anything the Beach Boys did in the musical genre. This is a great film.",1167782400,11,1124,4.890052356020942

500782,5,630271110X,"I remember watching this movie on TV when I was a kid.  When I found it while surfing (no pun intended) through the DVD section of Amazon.com I bought it.  What a sentimental blast from the past!  Three fabulous looking hunks, Fabian, Tab Hunter and Peter Brown, use their winter break from college to spend one last time together in Hawaii to surf Waimea, before they all head in different directions, due to issues explained later on in the movie. By the first evening they all meet the perfect girl who will eventually help them deal with and solve their issues while sitting prettily on the beach in the most fabulous bikinis, with hair that barely moves in the wind, even when they stand up to wave at their beautifully physiqued, half naked, wet men. Yummy! Responsible Tab meets obligation-ridden Dolores Hart. A curiously blond over-cautious Peter meets curiously dark haired free spirited Barbara Eden. Untrusting, angry Fabian meets cautiously-trusting, sweet, Shelly Fabares, who in my book wins the award for best bikini - a while lace number that doesn't look like it would survive a puddle spashing, nevermind a dousing from the Wild Surf.  While on the surface (again no pun intended) there is a fraternal feeling of comraderie and respect between the surfers, below the surface there is an undertow (I'm not going to apologize for this pun) of serious competition, as the winner of the contest, no only becomes known as the best surfer, but earns enough money to remain job free for a year to practice for the following year's competition - a dream come true for all of them.  The panoramic surfing scenes, accompanied by hawaiian drum beats, are actual films of real surfers and are fantastic, and there are plenty of them.  The close ups, while the talking scenes were filmed, are shot while the guys sit on the boards in water where I've seen bigger waves in my son's wading pool.  I read in Tab Hunter's book recently, that the close ups of them ""riding the waves"" were filmed while they were kneeling in red rider wagons, after being spashed with buckets of water.  However, it works well enough and is a lot of fun to see.  In this movie, the surf is the star, and is not like those dopey Annette Funicello/Frankie Avalon movies where surfing is an after thought.  The romances are sweet, there's comedy, drama, beautiful scenery and everybody's good looking - so hush little baby - don't you cry!  I highly recommend this movie for a little nostalgic fun, if nothing else.",1150416000,32,2495,4.7390300230946885
500783,5,630271110X,"A fun ""sun and surf"" flick of the mid 60's - this is certainly one of the better offerings of that genre.  With a good cast that includes Tab Hunter, Shelley Fabares and Fabian, this entertaining flick moves well,contains some fairly innocuous love scenes, and actually has some nice surfing footage.  Perhaps not surprisingly, it has a good message for teens and it's fun to watch too.  The title song was actually a hit tune as well - cute movie.",1142640000,3,448,4.575
