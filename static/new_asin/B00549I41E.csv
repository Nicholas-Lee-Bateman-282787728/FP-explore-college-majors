8456460,5,B00549I41E,"I discovered the ""William"" series and love reading the stories.  Each story is a chapter and so for us who catch a moment here and there to read, it's just right.  Funny thing about this series, it was written by a woman.  She must have had either a brother or a son who inspired her in these delightful tales.",1462233600,,310,4.220338983050848

8456462,5,B00549I41E,"I watched this series of 4 episodes (each featuring a story from Richmal Crompton's Just William books) and thought it was Brilliant.
I read the books avidly when I was at school (many years ago) and this is a very true adaptation of the stories, including William's long suffering parents, and of course Violet Elizabeth Bott (Isabella Blake Thomas who is brilliant). William is played by David Roche and gives a perfect portrayal of the irrepressible scruffy schoolboy battling against older sister and brother and teachers and gamekeepers along with the help from the Outlaws, making sure they always won. Robert Foster a Newcomer to our screens, played Henry
excellently, a perfect portrayal of the brain one trying to keep William out of trouble but yet I do remember Henry being to older one in the books.
In real life in 2010 he would be classed as an antisocial adolescent, charged with blackmail, trespassing, stealing, lying, etc, and given an ASBO. But the programs are set in the 1950s - The original books were 1920s when life was gentler and this behaviour was casually tolerated by everyone (and of course everything works out well in the end).
The high production values give a very realistic image of middle class life in the 30s, and all actors are excellent.
I have purchased the DVD because the programs bear watching more than once.
I nearly forgot to say the series are laugh-out-loud funny, and are intended for adults (despite the BBC misleadingly describing them as children's programs. But children are likely to be delighted as well.

Highly recommended for all the family.

Please BBC make some more of these.",1338422400,4,1637,4.906137184115524
8456463,3,B00549I41E,If you are a middle school or preteen student you will probebly like Just William. It's slanted probably for middle ages boys. Not for adult unless you like kid movies. RHR,1321142400,,172,4.580645161290323
