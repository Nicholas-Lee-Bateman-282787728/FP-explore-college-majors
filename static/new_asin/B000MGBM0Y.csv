8168563,3,B000MGBM0Y,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2006 and directed/written by Dennis Smithers Jr., ""A Bothered Conscience"" takes place in rural Arkansas and concerns a hermit father who has No trespassing signs posted all around his remote property and he ruthlessly kills those who disobey. He passes this curious hobby on to his son whose conscience cant handle the mounting slayings and corresponding guilt.

My wife & I saw a film by a local filmmaker (terms used loosely) that cost $2000 and it was easily the worst movie weve ever seen. Keep in mind that Im a fan of micro-budget indie horror flicks and am well aware of their typical limitations (bad sound, dubious acting, shaky hand-held cameras, bad editing, etc.). Despite this, they CAN be entertaining, whether the creators shoot for campy & amusing, like Backwoods Bloodbath (2007), or thoroughly austere, like Butchered (2010). Yet both of those movies cost quite a bit more than $2000, likely somewhere between $10,000-$50,000, give or take. Two great examples of micro-budget indie horror are The Lonely Ones (2006) and Another Kind (2013), but they cost $100,000 and $120,000 respectively.

A Bothered Conscience, by contrast, only cost $2300 and so I was expecting a real dog, like that local movie noted above. Thankfully, thats not the case at all as the film has a professional indie air from the get-go with a superlative score. The entire story takes place deep in the Arkansas forests and the sylvan cinematography is superb, creating an ominous vibe (comparable to the exceptional opening credits of the TV show Tales from the Darkside). While most of the acting is okay at best they're masterful performances compared to the non-acting of that other film.

The first 50 minutes revolve around people getting killed in the forest whereas the last 37 minutes reveal the title of the movie. There are some effective scenes in this last act involving a currently popular monster (I don't want to give it away, but it should be obvious).

It goes without saying that, to appreciate this movie, you have to enjoy the woods or woodsy outdoor photography. It successfully establishes a foreboding forestry ambiance. But the story isn't tight and it gets tedious after 30-45 minutes of redundancy. Its also marred by minor anachronisms. But things like this can be overlooked in a flick that only cost $2300. Another problem is the lack of quality females until just past the hour mark; and not enough is done with her (Tina Martin) when she shows up, but shes appealing enough for her brief period.

Despite these glaring problems, there are moments of greatness, like when a certain character in the last act gets shot and the song When I Awake by Hollow Earth Conspiracy is heard on the soundtrack (written by Paul Zlotucha). The sequence is almost worth the price of admission.

THE FILM RUNS 87 minutes and was shot entirely in northern Arkansas (Cushman, Horseshoe Bend, Weavers Chapel & Spring Mill).

8168564,5,B000MGBM0Y,"A Bothered Conscience is a stark, nearly flawless tragedy of sorts, filmed with an effect that hearkens to late 70s video nasty days, Smithers captures all the raw, edgy elements in A Bothered Conscience. It is a story that plays out harshly and matter-of-fact with characters that almost feel both protagonist and antagonist simultaneously for most of the film, until the real protagonist comes forth near the end. The dialog is minimal but effective, character dramatics are short bursts of terror or just straight chilling shock as most of the interactions are of a brutal nature. I found myself having to keep saying this is a modern film and not a previously unreleased video nasty from the late 70s.

The atmosphere is very reminiscent of classic gore flicks like Stanley or  Lets Scare Jessica To Death. Only the surreal is almost non-existent until the last act, most of the film is a visceral nightmare that unfolds plainly, with calculative bluntness. Although there is no layered visage to the characters, A Bothered Conscience creates a powerful, straight forward modern video nasty that is very entertaining. Special Effects and soundtrack are mild but clear elements that really make A Bothered Conscience a good film for gore-hounds and horror fans. The effects are smart, thought out tricks that offer gruesome moments to kill scenes without looking cheap, or cheesy.",1431129600,,1383,5.115044247787611
8168565,2,B000MGBM0Y,"The first half of this movie depicts a deranged man living in the woods with his son. The man believes the entire forest belongs to him and anyone who enters it is trespassing so he kills them. As the son grows he teaches him to shoot a rifle not only to hunt for food but to defend their ""kingdom"" from interlopers. The son becomes as deranged as the father. Then the father dies and the son must fend for himself, but he isn't as strong as his father. The ghosts of the people he has killed begin to haunt him leading to the twist climax of the film.

The first half of A Bothered Conscience is very bad. The acting is bottom of the barrel and its nothing but people being killed with no story or purpose. The second half is better as the son's descent into insanity has some creepy moments. The ending is also better than expected, unfortunately the first half and the atrocious acting drag the movie way, way down.",1346976000,2,918,4.30635838150289
8168566,1,B000MGBM0Y,"There are a number of ways to deal with trespassers. Some work better than others. Certainly, hunting them down and killing them rates at the top of preventing the violators from doing it again.

The opening scene was an Ed Wood special. The man (Dennis Smithers Sr.) is wearing an old military style shirt with the sleeves cut out, but it has a new looking airborne patch on it. The son starts out walking on his dad's left, then he is suddenly on his right.

Trespassers are shot and stabbed. They are killed but never tortured.
The movie flashes forward 20 years. The son Lucas (Stephen Martin) is grown. After 41 people have gone missing, the sheriff (MacFarland Martin) is getting a bit suspicious.

Dad eventually gets killed. Junior now must learn to kill trespassers on his own, except now he has descent into madness as he sees trespassers they have already killed. Shades of the Tell-Tale Heart! Now the problem with this madness scenario is that the dead walk like zombies and appear even when Junior can't see them.

And as for the twist at the end...my problem with the twist is that there was no clue during the film that is was going to happen. It was like putting space aliens in an Indian Jones film.
