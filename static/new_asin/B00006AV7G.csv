1741138,5,B00006AV7G,"Yesterday's Children is a wonderful, tearjerking movie.  It doesn't come on TV very often, but when it does, I always watch it from the beginning.  I just watched it tonight, and my eyes are again swollen!  I love all of Jane Seymour's movies, this one being the best.  I am one quarter Irish myself.  I would love to have a copy of this, in USA format (Hawaii), if one becomes available.",1211328000,5,388,4.408450704225352
1741139,5,B00006AV7G,"I am looking for this dvd with English subtitles I am very interested to get it. I recommend it because it is a good movie and it is based on a true story. I saw it on t.v. here in San Luis Potosi, mexico I liked it a lot and I think that Jane's performance on this movie is great and the other actors also. I hope amazon could have this dvd very soon to get it.

1741140,5,B00006AV7G,"This is a beautiful movie, with an unbelievable theme song, that nobody seems to be able to get anywhere.  The haunting music caught my attention before I even knew this movie was playing on TV and it drew me to the set where I sat completely enthralled until it was over.

I am a pushover for sentimental movies so it was right up my alley.  The spiritual aspects appealed to me and being Irish, it tugged at my heritage, too. With beautiful sceney, an intriguing story and THAT SONG...what a combo. I would think that the song's creator would push to get it out there to more people. That it isn't even on a CD as an Oscar winner, is unbelievable to me.  The song can be found for download on the singer's website JennMahoney.com.

(I found the movie DVD released to the Portugese, but with English spoken and Portugese subtitles, so it can be seen as we would see it in an English-speaking theater)

There must be a way to get the higher powers to realize what joy this movie would bring if we could just get it made available. If profitability is the carrot, we must dangle that out there, too.",1182470400,6,1098,4.384236453201971
1741141,5,B00006AV7G,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie.  It shows the importance of family at any age and the power of a mother's love.  If someone out in movieland sees this, please make this movie available on DVD in Region 1 (U.S. and Canada)",1181952000,17,228,4.404761904761905
1741142,5,B00006AV7G,"This is a beautiful movie that touches your heart.  The music is also hauntingly beautiful.
I would buy this DVD in a heartbeat but is not available in US format. Anyone interested in owning this DVD should notify Amazon to have it reformatted in Reg. 1.",1181952000,10,254,4.521739130434782
1741143,5,B00006AV7G,"I saw this movie on TV recently and would love to own a copy.  If I could buy it, the format is not usable in the US.  The music is excellent and the story is beautiful!  I am hopeful someday, I will find a way to have a copy of my own.",1181952000,4,236,3.5
1741144,5,B00006AV7G,"This is based on a true story, and it will leave you rethinking much of what you believe. It's about a woman with memories of a fairly recent previous life in Ireland, who manages to prove the details of that life and find still living members of her previous life's family.

 It also has a marvelous score. The mysterious theme song by Patrick Williams (with some verses translated into Irish by Sean Aherne) won an Emmy and this film is, at present, the ONLY way you can hear it. (Disclosure: the singer, Jenn Mahoney, is a friend of mine, but I'd say it even if I didn't know her).

The only fault with it is that the setting was moved from England, where the real woman lived, to the US - silly, really, since they had to go to Ireland for part of the film anyway, and Jane Seymour, who plays the protagonist, could have used her own accent.

The sad thing is that I can't purchase this DVD in a playable format for my area - which includes the studio where the made-for-tv movie classic was made. I have certainly searched the net, and all I can find is other searchers bemoaning the fact that they can't buy it. Sure hope someone gets the message!!",1179878400,19,1154,4.328703703703703

1741146,3,B00006AV7G,This is a true of a woman's search for her lost family from a previous lifetime. I feel that I would have liked to see a  lot more of the book put into this adaptation. Her inner struggle trying to determine whether these memories were real or mere imagination etc,1360022400,2,264,4.28
1741147,5,B00006AV7G,I saw this movie several years ago on TV and I've wanted to buy it ever since but I cannot find it anywhere in a USA DVD Format.  Please find a way to have this made so we in America can purchase it and play it on our DVD players.,1319414400,11,230,3.6
1741148,5,B00006AV7G,"I was a little worried when I purchased this DVD. I was not sure if it would have an ENGLISH sound-track or if it would play in my DVD player. Thankfully, it did have the English option & it did play in my player. The cover however, is in Portugeuse as well as any commentaries. So if you're not familiar with the language then the commentaries will be useless to listen to. With that said . . .
  The movie itself is based on the real-life book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-Time-And-Death-A-Mother-s-Search-For-Her-Past-Life-Children/dp/0671889869/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across Time And Death: A Mother's Search For Her Past Life Children</a>. Jane Seymour does a wonderful part in playing the lead role (of Jenny/Mary) in this movie. She starts having vivid memories that make no sense to her, in which she sees & feels things from another life. Thinking she's going crazy, she's unsure who she can tell about these things. Her husband tells her to keep it to herself. Her mother gives her a book (about reincarnation) and suggests that maybe she should investigate the possibility. Her son is supportive and tells her to pursue it.
  After reading the book her mother gave her & armed with the drawings she did of images from her visions, she hesistantly goes to see a past-life hypnotist. This brings up more details of Mary's life. Eventually she does more research, finds the maps she drew match actual historical maps of a place in Ireland called Malahide. She decides to take a trip to Ireland with her son to see if anyone remembers a woman named Mary who had five children & who lived in that area. She is frustrated at first when she seems to be getting nowhere. Eventually everything falls into place. She meets one of Mary's children Sonny, who is able to confirm some of the memories she has of his departed mother. She tries to re-unite all of Mary's children a little get-together but Sonny is reluctant to see his siblings again.
  A beautiful movie, based on a PAST life. Highly recommended viewing for someone who likes reading these types of books. I would recommend reading the book too, which has actual photographs of the author and children from her previous life.",1283644800,15,2245,5.005361930294906

I was delighted to find this DVD in a format which would play in all regions.  Don't be put off because the cover and all information is in Portuguese.  To set up: go to CONFIGURACAO, under IDIOMAS chose INGLES (English), then go to FILME (film).  The color is excellent, and the voices are of the actual actors.  Also, it has an additional ending not shown in the TV version.  Under EXTRAS, then ENTREVISTAS, then GALERIA DE FOTOS HISTORICAS there are photos which are easy to figure out....even with Portugese captions.",1277337600,13,679,6.094736842105263
1741150,5,B00006AV7G,"I remember watching a documentary about Jenny Cockell many years ago, and of her riveting account about her past life as Mary Sutton in Ireland, a woman who was married to an abusive man, and mother to a couple of children. Jenny was able to remember parts of her past life since she was a young child, and it is only in her adulthood that the memories become stronger until she finally decides to verify the memories for herself.

In the movie version, Jane Seymour plays Jenny Cole, who resides in the US with her husband and teenage son (I believe the real Jenny was from England). Though Jenny has recalled some aspects of her past life since she was a young girl, her memories become clearer through vivid dreams in which she sees herself as Mary Sutton, a woman living with an abusive husband and four young children, Sonny, Jeffrey, Frank, and Elizabeth. Jenny, with the support of her mother, undergoes regression, and her past-life memories surface. Jenny also undertakes a journey to Ireland with her son (her husband is a skeptic for most of the movie) to see if there is any credibility to her memories(though in her mind & heart there is no doubt), and to discover what actually happened to her 'children' from her past life after their mother's death in 1932.

The movie is haunting - Jane Seymour's portrayal as the distraught Jenny is so credibly portrayed, her determination and love for her 'past life children' come across as honest and poignant. The score and title song is absolutely beautiful, with a haunting, otherworldly quality. Oh, and I just love what the Catholic priest tells Jenny in the movie. In response to Jenny's question, ""The Catholic church doesn't believe in reincarnation, does it Father?"", and the priest responds, ""No, but it does believe in the occasional miracle"" (something to that effect). The cinematography, especially in the flashback episodes (memory recall) and also when Jenny and her family are in Ireland is just breathtaking, as is the haunting score. This is a movie that has captured my heart and will appeal to those who are interested in reincarnation and human dramas dealing with maternal love. I just wish the DVD version (for the US) is available (I watched this on LMN).",1256515200,,2235,4.802597402597403
1741151,5,B00006AV7G,"Basically why is this movie not on a north american dvd...I consider this movie as one everybody should view. It is similar to ""somewhere in time"" as it has time travel aspects. The story is excellent.",1234483200,17,201,4.611111111111111
1741152,5,B00006AV7G,"This is the most beautiful and tear-jerking movie I have ever seen and when lifetime shows it (which they should more often) I will stop whatever it is I'm doing and watch it from beginning to end. The acting is amazing, the scenery is breath-taking and the story is heart felt. I have seen it so many times and I never fail to shed tears. This movie is a must see!",1233446400,4,365,4.154929577464789
1741153,5,B00006AV7G,"I first watched this movie on TV one evening that nothing else was on, and I saw the listing for it, so I watched it.  I ended up needing a box of tissues for most of the movie, because I kept on crying, and I'm not one who usually does that.

The story is so inspiring and touching, that I just have no words for it.  This has made me see a new way of thinking, and just how much we don't know about the past and if at one point, we ourselves, were part of it.

I highly recommend it to everyone.",1219795200,,497,3.796116504854369

Everything worked out find however.  I just had to set up the language to English and it was perfect.  Received it in a few days too!

7966745,5,B00006AV7G,"I ordered this DVD despite the one available at the time being non-USA format, since some of the reviews said that it played for them anyway. I wanted to see this movie so badly, I decided it was worth the chance. It did NOT play for me on my USA format players. However, I was able to search the internet and view the whole movie online and the movie itself is more than fabulous. Whether you have read the book about this or not, which is available here at Amazon, if you are interested in this subject, this movie is so very good. I do wish the movie had worked, since I know I will want to watch it again and again, but I will keep my eye on Amazon to see if it becomes available in USA format.

The acting in this movie is very good and believable. The story line is amazing and sucks you right in. The characters are real and lovable. I just want all my family and friends to watch this, although I know it's a subject matter many are uncomfortable with. I like how the Priest in the movie states his idea of the possibilities of what is happening, which could make it feel more acceptable to others who feel strongly that reincarnation does not exist. Whether you believe in reincarnation or not, this is a beautiful and haunting story. It leaves you just wanting to know more AND wanting to run off to Ireland! What a beautiful place AND a truly beautiful story.",1491955200,,1370,4.269230769230769
