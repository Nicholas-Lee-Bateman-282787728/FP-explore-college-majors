6925625,5,B00RC16RFC,If you don't mind reading subtitles this is real good series. Best to watch Volume one first.,1425081600,2,93,4.529411764705882
6925626,3,B00RC16RFC,"The plots in Volume Two are, I think, more interesting than those in Volume One.  As in Volume One, the subtitles are in English only.  Overall, these movies are interesting, nice to look at, but they lack the suspense of  true murder mysteries.  I watched them once; I may watch them again with guests, but both volumes will end up at the public library.

Translation error:  In Volume Two, the subtitles at times mention Larousse or Delarousse.  This is a mistranslation:  the French expression ""la rousse"" simply means ""the cops"" or ""the police"" (""de la rousse""  = ""of the police"").",1423872000,7,585,4.77
6925637,5,B00RC16RFC,"Just when I was getting worried that I would never own the rest of this fascinating series from French television, they released the second volume that has all the remaining  episodes previously broadcast on MHz.  If you are considering buying this DVD set, then you most likely own the first volume, or have at least seen some of the episodes on a PBS substation--but just in case it caught your attention without you knowing anything about it, here is a quick summary:  ""Nicolas Le Floch"" is a French TV series, based on novels, where each episode is actually a film (like the BBC ""Sherlock"" series), and, naturally, it is in French with English subtitles.  Nicolas is a police commissioner during the final years of the monarchy before the French Revolution, about the time of the American Revolutionary War.  At the start of the series, Louis XV is on the throne, followed in 1774 by his grandson, Louis XVI, who would be deposed in 1792 and executed the following year.  Nicolas is apparently the illegitimate son of a noble who ends up inheriting the title by default, so he is sometimes referred to as a marquis, but often treated as lesser by the aristocracy he encounters.  The basis of each episode is Nicolas trying to solve a mystery or catch a criminal while hindered by the unequal justice system and the often deadly court politics.  Nicolas is incorruptible in the law, but not above romantic persuasion, which allows for lots of sword fights, horse chases, and romps in various bedrooms or brothels.  The period is meticulously recreated, using locations like Versailles and the Bastille, with fabulous costumes, tons of powdered wigs, and lots of entitled attitude from aristocratic characters.  Jerome Robert as Nicolas is both edgy and charming, giving a real-life contemporary feel to this historical drama.

The DVD set is good quality, but no-frills.  A Blu-ray version or some special features would be wonderful, but the fact that the second volume was released at all is enough for now.",1431648000,5,2012,4.902654867256637

6925640,5,B00RC16RFC,"This is an unusual detective series in French, with English subtitles.  The endings are not typical of what we get in most detective stories.  The bad guy doesn't always pay.  Both volume one and two are worth watching.  I wish there were more available.",1427155200,,254,4.704545454545454

6925644,5,B00RC16RFC,"Beautifully filmed and well acted. The script was well written and presented in historical context. It completely recast the police -detective genre by transporting it a few centuries and managed to make it intriguing. The costuming was excellent.
Well worth watching",1425859200,3,267,5.536585365853658
6925645,5,B00RC16RFC,"I'd seen a few episodes on Public Television and enjoyed them, but seeing them out of order and with gaps between episodes made it hard to follow the intricacies of French politics. Watching all the episodes in order made the whole experience more coherent.

The rollicking, no holds barred fight scenes (this is not by-the-rules fencing) and the naughty double entendre of French humor make this whole series an absolute pleasure.",1425686400,,431,5.070422535211268

8694792,5,B00RC16RFC,This is the type of movie that is so entertaining that it spurred us to look into the real history of the time. I watched it with two young teens who then ordered books on the actual history.,1503878400,,191,4.052631578947368

8694794,5,B00RC16RFC,"This show is fantastic.  I originally bought it for my mother but I really got into it as well. A truly fascinating time in French history brought to life with exciting plots and brilliant acting. I've become addicted.  I have only the first 2 seasons.  I really hope the remainder of the series get released in Region 1 format for US and Canadian viewers. I have a multi region player, but unlike my mother, I need the english subtitles.  Please PLEASE release the rest of the show here in the US!!",1464825600,,499,4.450549450549451
