6305239,4,B00IYLWSP2,"This DVD goes beyond BB King and into the history of the blues and of those musicians who were influenced by the blues. I loved the archival footage of BB performing. Seeing him play today don't do justice to how good of a guitarist he was as a youngster.  Wish they could have added complete performances of his early days in the bonus section.

The only bad part is my DVD arrived dislodged in the package and the last 30 minutes of the DVd is hardly playable.",1405468800,,462,4.2988505747126435

6305246,5,B00IYLWSP2,"Any fan of B.B., any fan of the blues, any fan of early rock, and anyone who just likes a good story should see this. This is the first ever comprehensive bio of B.B., and destined to be the definitive bio for all time. 2 hours long with lots more bonus material as well.",1403136000,,271,4.037037037037037
6305247,5,B00IYLWSP2,"It's hard to belief that blues Legend B.B. King will turn 90 years-old next year and still tours the world, ""three weeks on; three weeks off"".  Until recently he would play over 300 nights each year.

Surprisingly, no one had made a filmed bio of his life and career - until now, that is. This new film (2014) has been making rounds of the film festivals and now comes to home video on Bluray and DVD (and there is a companion CD as well - from universal Music Group. (I was provided an advance screener of the BD). (UPDATE 6/17- There will not be a physical CD release of the soundtrack; it will only be available as download with no notes or booklet.)

This is a must see for anyone interested in the blues, whether pioneers like Robert Johnson, Bukka White (B.B. King's cousin) or the other famous blues ""King""s - Albert and Freddie, or even ""the next generation"" like Clapton,  Jonny Lang or Derek Trucks. Director Jon Brewer weaves some archival interviews with lots of contemporary ones along with historic photos (most, it seems from the B.B. King Museum in Mississippi). Brewer got nearly every one you can think of (and some who don't often give interviews) to sit down and tell their stories. Let me start with just a FEW folks who he got on camera: Ringo Starr, LeonRRussell, Dr. John, Joe Walsh, Eric Clapton, John Mayall, Bonnie Raitt, Peter Green, Rufus Thomas, Johnny Winter, Slash, Carlos Santana, Bono, Aaron Nevelle, Susan Teseschi, Derek Trucks and Micj Taylor. Impressed? You should be. Most has a chance to play with, or record with King.

But there are not just celebrities here. B.B.'s 2nd wife discusses the effect of his touring on their marriage and relatives and original band members are here too.

The basic film ruins 123 minutes and that is long for a documentary. But Brewer had to leave almost 30 minutes of interviews (with the celebrities) on the cutting room floor and there are 13 bonus interviews - each just over two minutes - in the ""Bonus section"".  The other bonus feature is ""Live at Royal Albert Hall"" which has King singing (not playing) the traditional song ""See That My Grave is Kept Clean"", with a NOLa beat, on stage with Tedeschi, Trucks, Ron Wood, and Slash, followed by his major hit ""The Thrill Is Gone"", where he plays Lucille but leaves the solos to Slash. This clip runs about eight minutes. Since the documentary has no room for full performances, these two numbers give you a chance to hear a whole song.

The visuals and sound on the BD are great. The BD and DVD are not being released by any of the major video labels but, rather, by Music Video Distributors.  This title is a real coup for MVD. (I'm not sure why the majors didn't grab it.) As noted above ""Mr. King"" - and Lucille - are still touring and still making music. As King says in the most recent interviews included (many King interviews over a 30 year period are expertly pieced together by Brewer to  address an issue), he'll just keep playing till he just can't play no more.

Five Stars all the way!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Starts with BB's birth; progresses thru youth and exposure to hearing and playing music; to performing locally and....eventually...performing all over the word.

Ends with thoughts about his end of life.

6305255,4,B00IYLWSP2,"I highly recommend seeing/buying this excellent biography of BB King. It is told through interviews with him and people who knew and/or performed with him, and includes lots of performance footage but not complete songs. You really see the poverty and racism he and other Blacks in the American South endured and get a better understanding and appreciation of the blues music.

King was truly a wonderful, kind and humble human being. He probably did more to raise the status of blues music than anyone else. I had always known him as a guitar player, but really he was most famous as a blues singer with hit songs, and what a great voice he had! As a guitarist, he had a great and unique sound and style and vibrato but he also had limited technical skills, as he openly admits. For example, he had to be the lead player in the band because he cannot play chords and sing at the same time.

This film was shot near the end of his life, so it does capture all the important events, achievements, albums, etc. Also, it is well filmed in high definition (except for the old footage). The film looks and sounds very good. My only complaint is that it does not give full performances of songs from his peak period. However, there are 2 full bonus songs from late in his career, but with guest guitarists who are featured more it seems.

Enjoy!",1451433600,,1339,4.479508196721311

6305284,5,B00IYLWSP2,"B.B. KING
The Life Of Riley
MVD Visual 2014 DVD
Reprinted with permission from Blues Music Magazine
Sincere, honest, true, for real, genuine. If you have those five things, then you can play the blues. Carlos Santana.
 Within the first three minutes, Santana accurately and succinctly describes the life and music of B.B. King. Follow that with testimonials by Bonnie Raitt, John Mayall, Walter Trout, Joe Bonamassa, and Eric Clapton, and The Life Of Riley kicks off with all the power of a one-note lick on Lucille. From there, Jon Brewers documentary, narrated by Morgan Freeman, traces the rise of and subsequent worldwide notoriety that B.B. King has amassed throughout his glorious lifetime.
  The first 15 minutes trace Kings early life in and around Indianola, Mississippi. Sitting on his bus or in his Las Vegas house, he reminisces about his parents, his music, his school years, his Sundays in the church, sharecropping, segregation, and the earliest music he heard. Standing on a plowed cotton field, King also gives insight into the backbreaking labor of a sharecropper.
 At the 30-minute mark, King heads off to Memphis, only to fail in that first trip at establishing his musical mark. It was there, however, King sat with his cousin Bukka White and absorbed essential musical lessons. He explains how his signature vibrato was born through his frustrations of trying to emulate Whites vibrating slide on strings. After eight months, King returned to his tractor-driving job.
 After he paid off his debts, he returned to Memphis for good. Bobby Blue Bland and Rufus Thomas share Beale street stories, and King tells of his jobs and radio show at WDIA. His earliest recordings, Miss Martha King and Three OClock Blues, and his baptizing Lucille were the start of his early-1950s popularity.
 At the one-hour mark, Buddy Guy, Derek Trucks, Dr. John, Bono, Robert Cray, Walter Trout, Robert Lockwood, jr. Jonny Lang, and Susan Tedeschi all explain the gifts King was born with. Later, Billy Boy Arnold, Ronnie Wood, Mick Taylor, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Doyle Bramhall II, Joe Bonamassa, Paul Rodgers, Carlos Santana, and Peter Green, all offer praise his 1964 Live At The Regal recording
 His second wife, Sue Carol Hall, tells of the tumultuous life married from 1958 to the early 1960s to a musician who was logging 320+ nights a year. Sid Seidenberg tells of charting a more lucrative course in the 1960s; British invasion luminaries tell of his influence in England in the 1950s and 1960s; King lovingly tells of his standing ovations at his first Fillmore West gig in 1967 when he performed on a bill with Moby Grape and Steve Miller. By shifting from all-black audiences on the chitlin circuit to playing for white college kids on rock circuit, King took the blues to the whole world. Once there, The Thrill Is Gone only cemented his global status.
  Decades later, Bono recounts the experience of writing When Love Comes To Town, complete with detailed explanations of composing and filmed performances broadcasting King to worldwide audiences. When Bono was showing B.B. the charts, King countered to him, Gentlemen, I don't do chords. I do this.
  The final 20 minutes chronicle his Riding With The King album with Eric Clapton, musical tributes from his peers, snippets of his yearly homecoming concerts in Indianola, and a brief introduction to his museum, which opened in 2008 in Indianola.
  Throughout the two-hours, B.B. himself tell his life stories. Most are well-known and oft-repeated. But here, they are augmented with his recordings, archival photos, or filmed performances. Throughout his stories, told on buses, in hotel or backstage rooms, or at his home, we can see the aging of King. From a 70-something King with President Clinton to an 87-year-old King singing Sweet Home Chicago with President Obama in 2012, one can clearly see the physical effects, but the voice and guitar originality still come through as powerfully as ever.
 With Kings passing, this DVD docu-biography offers Kings longtime fans and friends another chance to celebrate the 65+ years of his enormous gifts we were blessed to have. For new fans, this DVD will throw open the curtain of discovery.

6305301,3,B00IYLWSP2,"So, the reason I cannot rate this five stars is because there are severe sound mixing issues with the DVD. If I could put on close captioning, that would address the issue. But this DVD does not allow me to put on closed captioning. It is a very simple, cheaply produced DVD with only the bare essentials. I think the DVD discmaker really cut some corners. How is the film? Well, the film would be great if I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR BB KING SPEAKING DURING INTERVIEWS. But any time the backing music comes on, it drowns out the voice of the narrator or anyone else speaking. I have tried this in different players and tvs and computers to no avail. The sound mix is just bad. There are AWESOME video clips, interviews, from the 40s to present day. This is an unbelievably well put together documentary about my favorite blues man of all time, The Chairman of the Board, the King of the Blues! But I have to say, the sound mix ruined it for me. Do I buy another? Or write to the company? I am so let down. I have been looking forward to this for months, literally.",1427414400,15,1059,4.3

6305305,3,B00IYLWSP2,"This is a BluRay that tells the story of BB King from BB himself and his friends, musicians and extended family. I had trouble keeping interested with the often changes from music to interviews etc. BB King is a very warm, kind man whi is also a magnificent blues guitarist and singer. He has been an institution in live blues music for over 5o years. He is a frail man today but still a very great bluesman and still can sing some great blues songs.
What I found that did not work for me with this film about BB King was the flow of the film and the music was at times not as great as BB can do, it could have included more of his classic songs rather than the few mediocre ones included.
Overall its an ok film about an iconic man and musician.",1422576000,,746,4.116438356164384
6305306,3,B00IYLWSP2,"If you are just starting to follow Mr. King this is an excellent movie to start your collection.  However, if you are an old B.B. King fan I do not believe there is much ""new"" material.  True, there is reflection in the movie from Mr. King, but not really what I was hoping for. If you read the autobiography you really learned nothing new or gained no insight.  I really wanted to see more clips of when B.B. King was ""King of Blues Guitar"" especially clips of when he was still slinging the ES-335 with f-holes!  and hear more about his relationships with other players like Albert King, Muddy Waters, T-Bone Walker.  Sound quality is excellent on the blu-ray; just too bad they put the wrong show on the DVD (Royal Albert Hall).  Would have been much nicer if Live at the Regal, or something equivalent could have been added instead.  It is not a bad DVD, however, I hope it is not the last on this Blues icon.",1421798400,,913,4.366863905325443
6305307,4,B00IYLWSP2,"The Life of Riley is as good an expo of the great man as you'll get. The first section covering BB's early years is riveting viewing and blends beautifully into his music career, blues emergence and eventual iconography. I'm a self copnfessed fan, having seen BB and his (best) band in concert in Melbourne Australia in the mid 1970s, around the time of his Zaire gig, but despite this enjoyed this documentary as a complete, in depth narrative of a great man, told by himself, his relations and his many contemporaries and friends. The music is great too, especially the gradual emewrgence of his distinctive guitar style.
If you want a criticism, BB does get a little "" syrupy"" about himself and his greatness from time to time, but this is amply countered by the dry reality of the likes of Bill Wyman, Walter Trout and Eric Clapton who do their best to tell it like it is and was. It's also worth the price of the DVD to see Barack Obama belt out a snippet of ""Sweet Home Chicago"". Thoroughly recommended.",1420588800,3,1009,4.549450549450549

6305328,4,B00IYLWSP2,"B.B. King: The Life of Riley (Emperor Media/MVDVisual) is a documentary film by John Brewer that traces the King of the Blues career from his days growing up as a poor Black in Mississippi to his present iconic musical stature reflected by the countless awards he has received including the Kennedy Center Honors and the Polar Music Prize. The film is narrated by Morgan Freeman and incorporates interview clips from King, childhood acquaintances, music peers, and contemporary rock artists who have been influenced by Kings music, particularly his guitar playing.

The documentary traces Riley King from his very humble beginnings growing up in a plantation economy to his emergence as a major rhythm and blues artist to the period of crossing over and his current status as a musical icon. There are interviews which those who knew B.B. when he was growing up along with folks who played a part in his emerging career including Rufus Thomas, Joe Bihari (who produced so many of B.B.s greatest recordings for the Modern group of labels) and Robert Lockwood as we get the picture of the plantation youngster who develops his musical skills, becomes a music personality and becomes a consistent recording star while starting a grind of hundreds of touring dates a year that he only is starting to slow down from today.

The film takes us from these humble beginnings to his iconic status today as his crossover from the Chitlin Circuit to the mass market is detailed with discussions of his signing to ABC-Paramount; the recording of The Thrill Is Gone; the performance and recording of Live at Cook County Jail: his participation in the legendary concert associated with the Ali-Foreman Rumble in the Jungle; other recording sessions including those with Leon Russell and members of the Crusaders; and his collaborations with Eric Clapton and U2. In addition to appreciations from a various pop-rock luminaries including Clapton; Dr. John, Bonnie Raitt, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi; Kenny Wayne Shepard, Carlos Santana, Slash and others, there are a variety of performance clips including some from his appearance on Ralph Gleasons Jazz Casual TV show, and some from a recent DVD of a concert at Royal Albert Hall (I cannot recommend the DVD from this performance). Also included is a clip of King receiving the Polar Music Award (the equivalent of a Nobel Prize) from Swedish King Gustav.

There is little, if anything, about Kings very successful collaboration with Bobby Bland in the mid-70s (and a clip from Soul Train of the two would have been quite enjoyable). Also why some of B.B.s band members are interviewed. One wishes that they had interviewed Ron Levy who played piano with B.B. in the 1970s (he was with B.B. King in Africa) and who his stories about playing with B.B. would have been enlightening. Also in lieu of, or in addition to, the rock stars, it would have been illuminating if more performers of color, such as his contemporary, Lloyd Price (who would have insights on the African concert that he helped organize), and contemporary guitarists such as Vernon Reid and James Blood Ulmer had given their insights with respect to B.B. Kings legacy. Extras in the DVD package include a portion of the  Royal Albert Hall concert and some interviews with some of the rock stars who appear in this documentary. Life of Riley is a well put together documentary that the general audience should enjoy, although the long-time King followers will be not fully satisfied.

The man is truly great in every sense of the word and this documentary strives for greatness too.  It's too bad it falls somewhat short.  The key, and I mean KEY, missing ingredient is the music.  There's almost no talk about who wrote the songs BB made famous and almost no talk about his particular playing style.  There are tiny snippets of songs, but not much in terms of performances here.

6305344,3,B00IYLWSP2,"This is a full length biography of one of the greatest and most influential blues artists of the 20th century. The first half of the documentary will be enjoyed by diehard blues fans telling the story of B.B.'s rise from a shack in Mississippi to become the most popular and succesful blues artist with African-American audiences including interviews with family, friends, fellow musicians and Joe Bihari, one of the owners of Modern, where B.B. had his many great early hits. Much of the commentary is by B.B. himself drawing on recent and vintage interviews with some of the gaps being filled by Morgan Freeman. By the time he had recorded his groundbreaking live album ""Live At The Regal"" he was beginning to get recognition by white audiences and in particular the English blues and blue-rock bands and much of commentary in the second half of the documetary is with members of the Rolling Stones, Johnny Winter, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Jonny Lang, Bono, Bruce Willis and many more. Obviously these people are significant to B.B.'s later career but it seems to me that too much time is spent discussing the significance of these artists which seems gratuitous particularly considering how much material they are trying to cram into 115 minutes. After about 1964 we see practically no African-American faces other than B.B. even though he influenced hundreds of black blues musicians who are continuing his tradition but since many of those artists working today don't have worldwide recognition I guess they are not considered important. Watching this documentary you really don't get an appreciation for how much impact B.B. had on other African-American blues musicians and African-American music in general. To sum up I found the first half of the documentary consistently rewarding, the second half unbearably dull and obnoxious. Caveat emptor. (FS)",1406419200,14,1860,5.141914191419142

King, who grew up dirt poor, and turned into one of Americas icons by hard work and hard travelling, living the life of the blues.

Well narrated by Morgan Freeman and including interviews with everyone ranging from John Mayall, Peter Green, Eric Clapton,Buddy Guy, Ringo Starr and Bono (did we REALLY need a cameo by President Obama? Hes giving US the blues!), the film has King taking you on a tour of his original stomping grounds where he learned to drive a tractor, and how his family members and mentors shaped him into the man he has become. What comes out more than anything else on this inspiring film is what is repeated over and over-its not p laying the notes as much as FEELING them. A collection of film from a gig at Royal Albert Hall along with extended interviews of the people in the film are parts of the bonus extras.

Only in America could a man come from such poverty to world wide fame and fortune. If you think you had a ruff childhood, watch this  film and see what ruff really is. The only fault I could find with this movie was not enough of B.B. playing and singing. The sad thing is, ya gotta get old. And B.B. is now too old to be performing. I wanted to see him live before he dies inspite of the fact that I'd heard his concerts the last couple of years were pretty bad. It was. B.B. managed to sing half of three songs, played the guitar for less than a minute, and just talked for an hour. It was pitiful to see him like this. So, watch the movie, enjoy all his cd's and dvd concerts. But don't go to a concert. It's too sad.",1405728000,3,896,3.977777777777778
