8230056,5,B000XVKRJU,Super useful to supplement my class lessons.,1501718400,,44,5.428571428571429
8230057,2,B000XVKRJU,"Covers basics of poi spinning.
Positives: Very well filmed, clear views of the tricks, clear explanation. Very beautifully shot performance segments. Two stars for that.
Negatives: There's nothing here that cannot be found for free on Youtube. The unconventional terminology would be an impediment for people who want to go beyond the basics and communicate with other spinners or watch other videos. ""Flirt"", ""earth"", ""love"" - what are those? Also, 15 of 50 minutes are dedicated to a yoga warm-up - I agree that a warm-up is a good thing, but spending almost a third of the time just on that seems superfluous.
Conclusion: not bad, but there are better choices. Nick Woolsey's basic series, Vulcan DVDs, the threeworlds Youtube clips all have more info, better presented.",1359763200,,773,5.094488188976378
8230058,5,B000XVKRJU,I bought this DVD and put it on my portable media player. Makes it really easy to learn if you can't do it indoors. They separated each move on a separate chapter so it makes it really easy to learn one move at a time. I've seen some videos online of how to do tricks and I think this video is more helpful. I can't really compare it to anything else though.,1282608000,,358,3.986111111111111
8230059,5,B000XVKRJU,"For anyone pondering Poi's, it's a great step by step DVD...and their compilation shows how with simple moves you can make astonishing presentations.",1235952000,,149,5.521739130434782
8230060,5,B000XVKRJU,"The good stuff: Solid basic technique, well filmed, and well presented.  The demos are done full forward, 45*, and full profile, with enough reps to see clearly.  Chapter breaks are well timed and the DVD makes it easy to view one section at a time on repeat if needed.  Also, they do a really fantastic job of making the most basic patterns look interesting by adding short performance segment after each demo.  These are some of the best fire-performance videos I've seen.  You can clearly see the performer without losing the impact of a burn.

The bad stuff: Terms non-standard in poi, but Poi Groove takes some liberties with even the most basic tricks.  For example; every other teacher I've seen calls a forward circle a ""forward circle,"" or just ""forward,"" but this DVD refers to it as ""earth.""

Even though they say ""learn both sides,"" they don't do it.  Everything they teach is to the right, and everything they demo is also to the right.  It can potentially lead to bad habits.  Also, there isn't a start-to-finish poi performance on the DVD.",1222041600,9,1054,4.704918032786885
