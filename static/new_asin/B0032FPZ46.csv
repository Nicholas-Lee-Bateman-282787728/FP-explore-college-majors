8387480,5,B0032FPZ46,"I learned so much from this DVD. There is so much to learn about SEO and web presence. Here it is covered completely and you can go over whatever you need. This is a short review because my phone is ringing off the hook after implementing many of the suggestions on here. I can't wait to get the rest up. Literally, my online biz almost doubled within the first month. I can be found and I stand out from the crowd-comments my customers said to me.",1272672000,,448,4.22093023255814
8387481,5,B0032FPZ46,"This DVD was useful to both of us in our household. One is a web pro and one is a business owner but web amateur. He provides clear and simple direction on how to improve your SEO rankings and if followed, you will see results.  I highly recommend for anyone who really wants to understand what the search engines are looking for in your website and web content.",1268265600,3,362,4.323529411764706
8387482,5,B0032FPZ46,"I'm no web master, but this DVD reveals SIMPLE THINGS that I can do to maintain my web site as if I were a pro--maybe even better. When I first watched through this DVD, I found myself feeling a bit overwhelmed/scattered, but inspired. The second time through, I took notes. My notes, along with the DVD header sections, helped me to easily comprehend the information presented here. This DVD clearly conveys that there are a few simple yet critical business practices I can apply to continually enhance my website as a referral source. I learned that many websites are designed to share information, but not necessarily designed to DRAW traffic. As a small business owner, it is so valuable to have a website that can continually invite new clients to my doorstep, and this DVD teaches me how to do it. The information, examples and resources shared here reveal how to appraise my presence in the web marketplace and how to improve it. Computers aren't really my thing, but this DVD shows I don't have to be a computer wiz to use my website effectively--I feel happy about this purchase!",1267574400,4,1088,4.731578947368421
8387483,5,B0032FPZ46,"I took a chance on this new DVD before it had any reviews. The DVD explains about a dozen factors that effect web traffic. I was able to implement about ten in my situation.

Very understandable, fun to watch. Could have expanded a bit more on what I'm learning is called ""Local Search"", but 60 minutes flies by. Gotta get ground covered fast.
i liked the tips on how to evaluate competitors' strength and how to give your own website a ""search engine health check"".
About half the vid was about planning and evaluating your and your competitors' sit, and the other half was about taking steps to improve your position in search results.

Yeah, I'd recommend it. Probably most suited to folks on a tight budget / small biz, who are looking for ways to get more traffic without ad spend.",1267401600,3,786,4.528169014084507
