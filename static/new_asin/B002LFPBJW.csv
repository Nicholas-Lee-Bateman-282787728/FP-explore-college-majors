3946985,2,B002LFPBJW,"As this DVD dates from 1997, it is excusable that it missed out on the wealth of information derived from freshly opened Soviet Russian archives.

Less excusable is its plain intention to paint Josef Stalin as black as possible. Consequently minimizing as much as possible his two great achievements: modernizing Russia and victory over Adolf Hitler.

Sorry, American readers: these achievements still make Stalin widely popular in Russia. Up to this day. It also should be remembered that Stalin's huge participation in World War II considerably shortened the war in Western Europe. Thus saving the lives of a few million American soldiers, including those of your (grand)fathers.

----------------------------

Both Stalin and Hitler were deliberate mass murderers, Stalin probably even more so than Hitler. Both dictators committed numerous other crimes while in power. There is a big difference, however: Stalin's legacy has a positive side, while Hitler ended up completely destructive & negative.",1261699200,11,1002,5.572368421052632
3946986,5,B002LFPBJW,"Mother Russia's Self-Applied, Slow Motion Suicide . . .

After many years of impatiently waiting for that which I believed would not come to pass, I now !hurrah! in disbelief learning that ""Russia's War: Blood Upon the Snow"" is finally due (or is presently available) for release this forthcoming Autumn, 2009. This particular documentary is one of the finest achievement in the field of (meritorious) art I have ever experienced, and because of - and not in spite of - the film's 8+ hour length, ON A PIRATED VHS COPY, I so often watched this properly dour, oft ebullient, fact by fact account of Josef Stalin's hideous war upon his own people, that I did eventually wear thin & through the virtual patience of my analog marvel, and then terminating the tape's command (i.e., stretched the tape thin & snapped the tape in two.)

""Blood Upon the Snow"" will fascinate you - for the survivors of Stalin, you will cheer - for the writers and for the cartoonist who defied him, you will learn of an odd, but genuine kinship - and for any soul still not convinced of a equal force of evil living coevally and merely thusways of Berlin, ready your mind for reproving.",1255046400,8,1161,4.631067961165049
3946987,5,B002LFPBJW,"I saw this series (10-parts) back in 2002 on History International.  It is, without a doubt, the best series on World War II's ""Front of Decision.""  Not only does it cover all of the major battles that punctuated this struggle, it delves into issues that are ignored in more cursory treatments. For example, the NKVD's ""blocking forces"" are discussed at some length--we're even treated to interviews with NKVD veterans who shot recalcitrant officers; it covers Germany's administration of the occupied territories and the privations visited upon the civilian population--the Holocaust among these ""difficulties;"" and we learn about the partisan war--not just fighting by pro-Soviet partisans, but Ukrainian and Polish freedom fighters--some of these conflicts persisted until 1947.

3947014,5,B002LFPBJW,"This review is to address a few of the complaints by other reviewers.

First, a few reviewers suggested that this series glorifies Marxism since it presents Stalin as a sadistic paranoid whose mental illness distorted ""pure"" Communism.  At no time in this documentary was it stated or indicated that Stalin betrayed the true ""intellectual"" heroes of a Sovietized Russia.  Yes, the documentary portrays Stalin as a ruthless manipulator whose ego, thirst for power and paranoia led to wholesale crimes against his own people.  But that Stalin turned out to be a bloodthirsty tyrant is in no way an endorsement of the view that Stalin betrayed the ""intellectual"" purity of the Soviet system.

Though prior to his death, Lenin had written a dispatch detailing his misgivings about Stalin's leadership abilities, this information was chosen to be buried by the ranking members of the Politburo. Stalin was simply the beneficiary (and master manipulator) of the duplicitous and brutal political system that was implemented during Lenin's Sovietization of Russia.

The impression is clearly given in the documentary that Stalin's rise to power was a logical historical progression caused by the power vacuum that was created after Lenin's death.  ""Blood Upon The Snow"" is in fact a chilling indictment of the political system that allowed such a socio-path as Stalin to gain unlimited dictatorial powers. Though Stalin's regime may have represented an extreme example of the brutish nature of the Soviet system, brutality and duplicity was indeed the proven path to power in the USSR.  Stalin simply excelled at both.

As episode two, disc 1, of ""Blood Upon The Snow"" clearly illustrates, a young Nikita Khrushchev was a dutiful enforcer of Stalin's brutal ethnic pogroms against the Russian peasantry in the Ukraine.  Krushchev bragged in a cable sent to Stalin in 1937: ""I have sent you 18,000 enemies of the people...Loving you Nikita.""  That Khrushchev later directed the ""de-Stalinization"" effort after Khrushchev's eventual rise as Soviet Premier is merely an example of the duplicity and political manipulation which was inherent to the Soviet system.

As is documented by 1st person interviews in the video, many of the children orphaned by the great political and military purges of the 1930s became of age with no illusions about the brutality of Stalin's reign.  Their hearts burned with hatred towards Stalin. Khrushchev's later ""de-Stalinization"" effort can therefore be seen as an act of political expediency, not the awakening of Khrushchev's political consciousness or any regret over his direct role in implementing Stalin's war upon the Russian people. Again, this is a searing indictment of the ruthless corruption of the Soviet Union itself, not merely an indictment of Stalinism.

In no way does this documentary stand as an apologia for the Soviet system nor does it indicate that Stalin's crimes against humanity were an ahistorical occurrence in the Soviet system. Such reviews are a complete mischaracterization of the editorial point of view clearly presented in this documentary.

Another complaint is that this documentary devotes too much time to WWII. Obviously a large part of the series is dedicated exclusively to WWII since the entirety of the war occurred during Stalin's reign.  But the documentary also covers the rise of Stalin, Stalin's consolidation of power after Lenin's death, Stalin's use of forced famine as a political weapon, Stalin's unprecedented political and military purges of the 1930s, Stalin's political division of Eastern Europe in the post-War years, Stalin's brutal suppression of Ukrainian nationalists, Stalin's death and Stalin's ultimate political legacy.

This is a chilling and excruciating documentary of one the 20th Century's most brutal mass murderers. Highly recommended.",1413504000,4,3834,5.384615384615385

I would guess this was due to the very closed nature of the country and now we are hearing more from people who can tell more about the real history as the iron curtain dropped a little. The more time goes by since my seeing these documentaries the more this time in history and how it is still relating to the present hits home. Now it makes complete sense why the Ukranians were welcoming the Germans as liberaters during operation Barbarossa. Scary to think what time will unfold about China, N Korea, Cuba, and now Nigeria, Sudan and the middle east countries.

3947053,5,B002LFPBJW,"This is a very good documentary on Stalin. It is very informative of the atrocities he committed. It also explains Stalin's pact with Hitler, to carve up Poland between themselves. I highly recommend it. It is important for people to know how Communists treat their own people when they gain full control. A lot of people think that Communism is no longer a threat. Unfortunately, it is still a threat. Stalin tricked the Russian People by promising them a lot of things. This is how Communists can get themselves elected in a free country, by fooling the people into thinking government will take care of them. When they gain full power, then the killing starts.
Stalin would kill anyone who he even suspected of disagreeing with him.  This documentary should be seen by everyone, as in ""for warned is for armed. It would also be great for history buffs, as it very completely tells the story of Stalin.",1389312000,3,904,4.7215189873417724

3947056,5,B002LFPBJW,"It's almost as difficult to judge historical periods from a distance as it is from a coeval perspective.  It's now 2013.  Stalin died in the early 50s.  What do Russians think of him now, 50 years after his death.  I asked a young chat friend from Ufa, Bashkortistan, Juliet Vladimorovna, who is a poet and teacher entirely divorced from politics (but not Russian history) what she thought of Stalin.  ""He was a jerk.""

According to this series, Juliet was wrong.  He wasn't a jerk at all.  He knew exactly what he was doing and why -- except that almost every decision he made was ethically wrong.

Ditto for the Nazis.  They ""liberated"" places like the Ukraine and were welcomed but they soon revealed their true nature by treating the inhabitants as slaves and executing all the Jews and other undesirables.

But the point of view here is not the Germans' but Stalin's.  After the purges of the 1930s, which killed off most of his generals and, in fact, anyone who could be considered a rival for power, he went on killing others.  They included Russian POWs who might have been tainted by fascist ideology. That included women and children who had been slave laborers under Hitler.  Partisans with any popular appeal disappeared, although they had fought for the Motherland.

The generals who had won the war for him were afterwards sent to a symbolic Siberia, if they weren't executed.  ""Blocking units"" of soldiers were ordered to shoot down penal battalions who refused to walk across mine fields and thus clear them.

It's an incredible story.  Juliet was right in a moral sense.  Few people could have been more of a ""jerk.""  But, pragmatically, his personality was conflated with the winning of the Great Patriotic War.  At his death, he was genuinely grieved.",1373932800,15,1770,4.7947019867549665

3947081,4,B002LFPBJW,"Not knowing what I was getting into, I quickly found the 3-DVD set of 10 chapters easily to became a must for any serious study of the 20th Century, especially WW II. Too many of us learned about Stalin from a relatively closed-lipped Soviet presence on Russia's archives and associated him too closely w/ Allied powers who defeated Hitler. However, with the fall of the USSR, and with elderly Russian veterans and citizens wanting to share their stories, this gem of personal interviews, USSR state secrets, and copious amounts of newsreel-like battle footage is priceless.

While the production quality misses the mark for those demanding slick production, the content more than makes up for it. Out of respect for the millions who lost their lives under this brutal regime, I felt ashamed that I bristled at the sometimes less-than-Hollywood graphics and editing. In actuality, it rarely mattered as I was glued to the series during a period of sleepless nights, all to myself, amazed at the enormity of the scale of the Eastern campaign and horrified at the duplicitous, narcissistic, evil Czar (for that is who Stalin was) that Stalin rose to become.

Chilling. An outstanding contribution to the world's knowledge of the Soviet's rise to prominence in cahoots, comparison, and contrast to the Nazi reality.",1365379200,2,1312,5.069444444444445

3947083,4,B002LFPBJW,"First, this is a great series with some footage that i am sure is rarely seen in the west. Further, while it goes into great detail about the German-Russian War, it does not sugarcoat the brutality of Hitler OR Stalin.

I would give this a five-star rating except for a few items.

1. Subtitles were always on, even if subtitles ""off"" was selected in the settings menu. This was a minor irritant to me. It might be more of one to others.

2. All the interviews of Russian commentators were accompanied by English voice-overs. For starters, I prefer to hear people speak in their own language, with subtitles in English for translation. I think you get a much better feel for their thoughts and emotions, even if you don't understand their language. That is why I refuse to watch English-dubbed movies if there is an alternative version with subtitles. But beyond that, I thought most of the voice overs were over the top--almost as if a voice actor was trying to impress a potential agent or producer! The inflections, speed of speech, etc. were all extremely contrived--no one would carry on a normal conversation like that in English, so why would you do a voice over like that? You just have to see and hear the DVD to see what I am talking about. Again, it was a mild distraction, but one nonetheless.

3. The producer and/or director occasionally chose to spend 3-5 pointless minutes on arbitrary side items of human interest, that more often than not detracted from the great story. For example, there was footage of a  group of 12-year-old Russian cadets marching in the Moscow snow--even though the narration itself states, ""the war will be over by the time they are old enough to fight."" Why? Here is another piece of footage (accompanied by the same extremely stilted voiceovers) from what looks like the 1960s of a couple of middle-aged Russian men walking around the woods in the place of what used to be their cadet training academy from the war years.

So these are rather mild critiques. Overall the series was well-done. The fact that it was produced in the 1990s makes it all the more valuable. For starters, many of the war veterans were still alive and doing well at that time. Now most of them are most likely dead or in their 90s (as of 2013). Second, this was a time of great KGB archival releases to both Russain and western researchers during the Yeltsin years. Much of that has been withdrawn and stopped since Putin came to power, so it was a DVD series produced with honest documentation not available today!",1364169600,3,2535,4.647321428571429
3947084,5,B002LFPBJW,"Outstanding mini-series about Stalin's rule concentrating on the Great Patriotic War (WWII).  Too deep for the general public and could be deeper for the hard core, but overall quite good emphasis.  Concentrates mainly on the human drama not military strategy.  It is more of a documentary than a movie, but focuses well on the Russian soul and how Stalin abused his people - not a recitation of casualties.  Music which introduces each episode is excellent.  Many interviews after 1990 with people who are very anti-Stalin and were present in the 1940s.  Some were victims of Stalin but survived.

3947101,5,B002LFPBJW,"Ten-hour documentary series on the Stalin years. The first two sections cover the pre-war years. The next 7 the Great Patriotic War, and the last discusses the beginning of the Cold War and the Cult of Personality.

The series is very well done, using revealing archival footage (both German and Soviet). Some reviewers have commented that the history is simplistic. I would disagree. A deep knowledge of Stalinism is useful, as the film points out pivotal examples of, for instance, Stalin's executions or Stalin's collective punishment of the Chechens. A knowledge of Soviet history is needed to fully appreciate the series. The documentary mentions Michael Koltsov, Soviet intellectual and journalist who was executed on orders from Stalin during the days of the Spanish Civil War. The film mentions Akhmatova as well, without really going into the details. This film is, despite its ten-hour scope, still limited on certain aspects of Stalinism. Not everything can be covered. Issues that are touched on without being explored deeply are the arts, collectivization, and the purges.

What one does get from the series is a deep sense of the disturbing ways in which Stalinism both crippled the populace while simultaneously making the Soviet Union a world power.

The series' most outstanding coverage deals with the Great Patriotic War. The series goes into great detail about all the critical battles- the battle of Moscow, the Siege of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kursk, the Battle for Berlin. The series also illuminates new statistical information detailing the appalling casualties (1 million men were lost in the Battle for Moscow alone). These statistics were only made public in the 1990's. There is also a fantastic section called ""The Fight from Within"" about the partisan struggle behind enemy lines. You get a sense of how horrific the situation was for ordinary individuals caught in the horror of Nazi occupation.

Excellent series, and one of the most thorough examinations of WWII from the Russian perspective.

Highly recommended. Also, please note that the consolidated DVD version is about half the price of the original VHS version (long the only available version of this documentary).",1354492800,5,2205,5.27065527065527

There are several inaccuracies of fact, ones that should have been easy to capture as they require no specialist knowledge.

The main problem I have with the film is the inordinate amount of time spent on various crimes & ills of Stalin.

Not that this information about Josef Stalin isn't interesting, a-lot of it doesn't seem very relevant.

And the film sheds no light on Stalin or his crimes. According to the narrative tens of millions were murdered by Stalin because he was paranoid, megalomaniac, addicted to power, etc. No time is spent at all on Stalin's ideology. It would sound pretty ridiculous if someone argued that ""Hitler"" killed so many Jews because he had a thirst for power or he liked violence.

Footage showing actual war is lacking..and much of the time will be watching and listeing to Russians tell their stories..about Stalin,,the horrors of the Nazis and the war. etc.(particularly towards the Jews and the Ukranians). Also much footage shows historical Soviet troop movements, parades, construction projects..and concentration camp footage. There is very interesting segments on the Russian attack on Warsaw on their way to Germany..and it is interesting to see the footage they took..(this is what makes this documentary most interesting)

3947121,5,B002LFPBJW,"Twenty three years after the Russian Revolution, while still reeling from Stalin's bloody purges of the 1930s, including the decimation of its top Soviet military leadership, Adolph Hitler sprang his Blitzkrieg against his Russian partner in their Non-Agression Pact.  Expecting the whole ""rotten edifice"" of the of the Bolshevik State to collapse, the German forces almost made their way to Moscow.  Stalin had consolidated his power, usurping the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" and creating a political structure to rival that of all the prior autocrats who had ruled Russia.  But Hitler and his followers had not counted on the will of the Russian people who resisted the brutal Nazi invaders who considered them inferior beings.  ""Russia's War:  Blood Upon the Snow"" is above all the story of the heroic Russian People who triumphed over the so called  ""Master Race"" of the Nazis, while suffering under the rule of the last Russian Tsar who finally died in 1953.  Hitler's Third Reich lasted only twelve years, and the Soviet experiment lasted a total of seventy-nine years, but the world is still dealing with the repercussions of this war within mankind's greatest war.  This documentary serves as a companion work to the British ""World at War"" documentary series.",1323475200,5,1273,5.175609756097561
3947122,3,B002LFPBJW,"I was hopeful that the hype in the advertising about this series would be using new material possibly released during the Perestroika years...probably since then shut tight again... to illuminate the true horror of Stalins purges as well as to comment that Stalin's actions were merely more exacting renditions of Lenin's own philosophy necessitating purges of those who would stand in the way of developing Socialism/Communism.  This philosophy was not even original but developed in the 70 years prior to the revolution.  That's what I hoped this series contained.  I hoped that new documentary evidence would put the blame for the millions of deaths squarely onto Stalin.  That, in turn, through fear, transferred the viciousness necessary to carry out the shootings, the fake trials etc., the deportations onto the bureaucracy of fluidity that he created.  I call it a bureaucracy of fluidity because, whenever he became displeased with the people's representatives, he would just have them arrested, deported or shot. That definitely makes those jobs fluid.

My hopes were only mildly rewarded.  This is mostly a rehash of what was already known with footage of WWII that has already been played in a half dozen series about the war. So, little new here for the mind and only a review for the eyes.  If you have not seen every possible WWII series, you might find some of this interesting. For people who were born just after the war and have looked at as much of it as they can stand, this would be a pass. Students of Russian history would do well to read a book instead. At least that's my take on it.

3947123,5,B002LFPBJW,"this is an extraordinary, class aaa, best of the best documentary. i watched it twice in a seven day period during which i had worked four, 12 hour days. i was reminded of all the books and movies/documentaries i had ever been exposed to which focused on ww1, ww2, the cold war, vietnam war, nazi germany, the holocaust and other events of catastrophic human suffering and genocide.

it brought me to my knees emotionally to reconsider what dictatorial madness, human betrayal, miscalculation of the spirit of evil, and worldwide governmental blunders do cause: incalculable tragedy for innocent men, women and children. for me these incredible chapters were expertly crafted into a story i knew about, that is the stalin years, and will now not forget any and every day for the rest of my life.

i am now 60 years old. for all my life i have asked with all my heart and being one question over and over! ""how could people be so cruel to others."" i now, with this incredible and powerful documentary have a part of an answer. people choose to be cruel and others stand by and allow it to happen. they often join in; while others stand by and watch.",1308182400,24,1148,4.595121951219512

The interviews and historic films are highly informative and valuable. The TV series also refers to the Katyn massacre, an appalling event the former Soviet Union acknowledged responsibility of only in the recent past.

A lot of this footage I've never seen before, and usually in documentaries about WWII films get to be redundant at times. This seems like all unreleased footage of WWII Russia, and the time line it states which was around 1924-1953, which was about the time period Stalin rose to power. DVD rendering is in excellent condition as far as graphics and sound. Actually too good and too real, because there are some film pieces that can be quite disturbing. But it should show everyone exactly how bad Stalin was during his term of power in Russia! It makes you wonder who was the worst evil in the 30's: Hitler or Stalin? And How could 2 different people rise to power so close together and cause serious hardship to millions of people and millions of families in Europe! There are also Russian survivors of that time period giving first person testimony. After watching this series you should come out of it thinking how in the world did anyone ever survive all those purges, and even the hardship the Germans placed upon the populace during that time period.",1296864000,,1203,4.6

If you like WWII you will like this, it really shows how ""stupid"" these ""leaders"" were. Hitler and Stalin both. they lead through fear and brutality, just like others we have seen (Amin,Saddam etc.) We well see these type of leaders again. I just hope not here in the US once our soveninty has all but been given away by our politicians. Our freedom of speech is erroding at an alarming rate along with our right to assemble.

3947129,1,B002LFPBJW,"First as a documentary, do not expect Ken Burns quality or accuracy. The video and imagery is dull and slow. If you love history then this will not matter like it did not to me.

Second, when it comes to content this documentary is quite revisionist and sympathetic to socialist economic and despotic systems. It basically states quite from the beginning that the people of the Soviet Union had started to enjoy the benefits of the new system when Stalin came into power, that they were in a jubilee when he became their leader. Everything was going well in the first few years, since Stalin had not gone insane yet. The documentary shows imagery of happy crowds, much like the ones you see today in China, Iran, Cuba and North Korea.

Then it goes into the thesis that Stalin ruined it for the rest of us. He happened to be crazy and all of the bad things you have heard of the Soviet or Communist system is due to him being so insane and having had longevity. Which is patently false, since the murder, poverty and horrors of Stalin's years continued after his death. The Gulag Archipelago did not started with Stalin's rise and did not ended with Stalin's death. Lenin exterminated the Royal family and authorized the ""Red Terror"" operation. Khrushchev and Brezhnev were no sweethearts either.  Stalin happened to be more successful for a number of reasons that I will not get into here.

""There was very much a method to Stalin's mayhem which this series does not in any way wish to expose, and it seems much more comfortable in a more palatable revisionist approach: that Stalin was an evil madman erratically enacting his whim to the horror of Western society.""

One of the reviewers before wrote the following, which I want to state here is correct. The documentary does not wish to expose the fact that Stalin was a product of the socialist system and philosophy. Trotsky and Lenin were equally murderous, but the documentary portray them as thinkers and honest leaders that knew before hand that Stalin was going to ruin their paradisaical soviet creation. So they wrote these supposed letters to warn the rest of the people. I can make no comments about the authenticity of these documents, because I have not seen them, except that it doesn't make any sense that someone with absolute power like Lenin could not get rid of Stalin. Give me a break!

Don't waste your time with this DVD. If you want the real history you should read:

3947131,5,B002LFPBJW,"If you like the World at War dvd's, you will enjoy this as well.  OK, perhaps enjoy isn't the best word to use, as there is nothing enjoyable about the actions of Stalin against his own people. If you think that Hitler was the end all-be all of psychotic despots, this will be a real eye opener.

This series is laid out in similar format to the World at War, with each episode covering a specific subject, beginning from when Stalin first came to power until his death.  Also, as with the World at War, if you blink you will miss something; the wealth of information and images are just riveting.

There is an incredible amount of real footage, and as far as I know, only one recreation in the entire series. There are also numerous interviews, including a brief appearance from Vasily Zaitsev.  Not interviews with analysts, but with actual participants.  Had this series not been produced, and these interviews recorded, so much would have been lost.  They are not always pleasant to view, but they are candid.  There is also some attention paid to the Russian women who fought in every capacity during WWII.  Who would have ever thought that there would be a need for a team at the back of the troops to shoot people who turned and ran from battle???

I have already recommended this dvd to several friends and purchased one for my sister; I have watched the entire thing twice and I know that I still have not caught every image or absorbed everything that this dvd has to offer.

Blood Upon the Snow pulls no punches in documenting and showcasing the absolutely brutal and visceral way the Eastern Front of WWII was prosecuted by both sides.  A lot of students are simply unaware of the strategic importance of the Siege of Leningrad, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and the purges that preceded Barbarossa.  While certainly not an uplifting film, it is very thorough and the actualities given by the surviving veterans of what is known as the Great Patriotic War is something that should serve as a counterbalance to what's being taught in a lot of Western schools.

Put simply: this series will blow your mind and you'll find out the depths of the paranoia and obsessive control of one Josef Stalin in graphic detail.",1271635200,5,932,4.8427672955974845

3947137,5,B002LFPBJW,"The purpose of me purchasing this DVD set was my desire for an in-depth look at the titanic struggle between the Soviet Union and Germany ... however, this video collection gave me much more.  It was so compelling, I watched the entire series the day I received it.

The title speaks for itself ... ""Russia's War"" details the horror and suffering inflicted upon the people of the Soviet Union, not only by invading Nazis, but by their own leader (Stalin).  This documentary covers virtually every facet of Stalin's reign and greatly details the years of the ""Great Patriotic War"" (World War II).  The picture that is painted of Stalin is not at all flattering ... and it shouldn't be.  Too many revisionists try in vain to portray the evil little dictator as being unjustly maligned over the years, even though the evidence of his actual reign-of-terror is overwhelmingly well-documented.  ""Russia's War"" delivers a wallop with rare archival footage as well as current interviews with those who lived through those dark days.  As someone who studies World War II's Eastern Front, I found ""Russia's War"" to be very educational and not a simple re-hash of common topics.

""Russia's War"" provides eye-opening insight to the plight of a citizenship that suffered so much under the brutal, vengeful Stalin that it actually received the invading German Army as saviors ... only to be victimized even further when the Nazis began implementing their plan for ""lebensraum"".  What is so shocking is the devaluation of human life ... the millions murdered, starved-to-death and imprisoned is shocking.  But, add the four year struggle with Germany and the loss of life is simply staggering ... especially to those of us in the ""west"".

The film footage is incredible, the research thorough and the overall presentation of the series is superb.  I would recommend this DVD-set to anyone who has an interest in history, and especially to those who wish to learn more about Stalin and the Soviet Union during World War II ... this series is astounding on all levels.",1265673600,6,2052,4.950437317784257

I can only hope that it's based on their lack of understanding of how historical documentaries should be filmed. Or maybe they don't know anything about history. Or maybe they're WWII buffs who don't have perspective. Regardless, Joseph Stalin rules for nearly thirty years. Out of a episode series, literally 6, 2/3 of the series, are dedicated to WWII and heavily focused on Hitler and the Nazis personally. Insteas of focusing on the horrors of the soviet regime, there are hours of film time dedicated to the holocaust (completely unrelated to Stalin), the military staffs of Germany plotting to kill hitler, and the war in general. Literally, all of that happens in 4 out of the 30 years Stalin ruled, and these ""historians"" devoted 63% of their time to that junk. Save your money.
