2388820,1,B000AGTQEK,"This is a good example that some DvD's should have parental warning labels.  This one should read: WARNING!  THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNY

Someone got this for me as a present because I like Lewis Black.  He's funny, but this is nothing like his stand up routine or any of his recent work.  All the jokes [sic] are sexual.  It's a couple of sketches filled with recycled offensive sexual humor.  Usually when one uses an old joke, one endeavors to tell it in a funnier manner than it was previously used.  Not so in this DvD.

A three year old says, ""poo poo,"" and laughs and laughs as if it's the funniest thing in the world.  The humor in this DvD is little different.",1139616000,8,663,4.274193548387097
2388821,1,B000AGTQEK,"Yuch! My husband and I are HUGE Lewis Black fans, based on his live proformances, CDs and Comedy Central apperances. I bought this DVD for my husband's birthday. I was embarrased when we watched it together. I would like to think that this was done when Black was young, hungry and obviously stupid, but he doesn't look that young in the skits. I am also ashamed of anyone who paid Black or any of the other performers for this work. We are not prudes and may have been able to look beyond the crude vulgarity of this work if it were only funny. Don't waste your money on this. Spend it on some of Black's audio CDs, esp. the White Album and The End of the Universe.",1133827200,40,666,4.251968503937008
2388822,5,B000AGTQEK,"THIS DVD CONTAINS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SHORT FILMS OF ALL TIME

CALLED ""SIDESPLITTERS: THE BURT AND DICK STORY"". IT STARS

LEWIS BLACK AND JIM NORTON AND IT'S DONE DOCUMENTARY STYLE.

THE SHORT HAS STYLES RANGING FROM THE THREE STOOGES TO

LAUREL AND HARDY. PARTS OF IT ARE FILMED TO LOOK LIKE

AN OLD FILM FROM THE 30'S. I HAVEN'T LAUGHED THIS HARD IN YEARS!

THE SECOND SHORT, ""THE GYNECOLOGISTS"" IS FUNNY TOO BUT THE REAL GEM IS THE FIRST SHORT FILM. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS.

YOU WILL LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF! LEWIS BLACK IS A COMIC GENIUS.",1126742400,12,547,4.356435643564357
2388823,2,B000AGTQEK,"I had no idea what to expect from this, and am still not sure how this pair of sketch comedy shorts featuring Jim Norton, Lewis Black, Greg Fitzsimmons, and Jim Gaffigan among others can be rated, or even explained as they are presented. Vaudeville and Laural & Hardy-inspired as these skits are, there is little to explain their concept or even what we are watching. On the DVD are two skits. That's about it. No interviews, no extra footage to invite the viewer into the concept, nothing.

That's not to say that some of the performances weren't well done. The ideas for these pieces do seem like they were good ones; I am, however, left with an empty feeling after. In the descriptive terms that Lewis Black has himself used in the past, A Pair of Lewis Black Shorts come up short and to many will come across as proverbial candy corn.",1124928000,19,838,4.5131578947368425

8078431,5,B000AGTQEK,"Really like Lewis Black, but didn't like this.

I prefer his 1-2 hour stand-up to these ""shorts"".

8078434,1,B000AGTQEK,Beware - this is Lewis Black learning to become a comedian - amateurish early burlesque style skits,1215216000,,99,4.882352941176471
8078435,1,B000AGTQEK,"I bought this DVD hoping for an entertaining night at home. What I got was a huge dissapointment. It wasn't funny at all, well it might be if you where a 11 year old boy. It was raw and crude. I would return it in a heartbeat but no one seems to want it. I wish I had read the reviews befor I spent my money. I would have been better off cleaning the house-at least it wouldn't have been a waste of time.",1214352000,,404,3.8214285714285716

8078437,1,B000AGTQEK,"I love Lewis Black but this is a piece of garbage.  The are not any laughs in either these two stupid, worthless shorts.  If I could I would give this zero stars.  There are no redeeming qualities about this dvd.",1161907200,2,212,4.25
8078438,1,B000AGTQEK,"I've been a huge Lewis Black admirer for a long time, spending money on concert tickets, books and dvds, and was excited to receive this dvd.  But now I feel like a complete schmuck. I was horrified at the ""gynecologist"" sketch. Apparently he thinks that women who go to the gynecologist just sit there in the little rooms completely naked, all juiced up and waiting for somebody to screw. It certainly wasn't comedy, so I guess it was supposed to be soft porn. I was going to send it back and get a refund, but I'm going to destroy it so no one else will have to see it.",1147305600,8,571,4.238532110091743
