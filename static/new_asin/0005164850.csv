It is a brilliant, warm and inspiring work of art. However, how or what else could you do about this man. He simply stands alone.",1387929600,,281,4.035714285714286

201880,5,0005164850,"and down right honest. Like all of anything with Billy Graham connected to it,honesty. Integrity,and love for God and His Word. I cried through much of it. The Holy Spirit worked through this long after the filming,which is what happens with ""the truth"" that God is involved in. Billy Graham as a mere man,will not once let you down. He is devoted to God and his family and saving souls before Jesus comes back. I literally was rooting for those who commented,that they would go up front and be saved. Good presentation.",1363219200,5,520,4.663043478260869
201881,4,0005164850,"In this PBS production, we get an overview of Reverend Graham's life, from his youth as a Fuller Brush salesman to being the most prominent living evangelist in the world. There is also a little history of the evangelical movement in the U.S. from its inception, and some early film clips of Rev. Graham's early crusades that are marvelous, and that also include some of his ""team"" who have been with him since the beginning, among them George Beverly Shea and Cliff Barrows.
This documentary centers on a crusade in Portland, Oregon, where they show the extensive planning, the pre-event rehearsals, the people going door-to-door with announcements, the prayer teams. When one includes the huge choir, and all the technicians, a crusade can involve as many as 30,000 people, all coordinated for one purpose, to lead people to Jesus.

I am sure the producers of this documentary would argue that they were giving us a ""balanced portrait,"" but unfortunately, it is done with the undercurrent of a snobbish attitude, in the words emphasized and in the people they chose to interview. They dwell at length with a certain Charles Templeton, a man who calls himself a ""friend"" of  Graham's but speaks with the tongue of a snake, and thinks Rev. Graham has committed ""intellectual suicide"" and is preaching an ""outdated faith."" Written and hosted by Randall Balmer, there is much that made me uncomfortable, with a feeling that those who created this documentary sadly were not familiar with their subject, but rather had a pre-concieved opinion they tried to present.

There is a final ten minute interview with Rev. Graham which is a delight. If you can get past the supercilious tone of this documentary, it is well worth watching, especially for footage of young Billy Graham, tall and angular, preaching his heart out; a charismatic soldier for the Lord, who has become a much loved general in His army. Running time is approximately 1 hour and 46 minutes.",1082678400,24,1955,4.9361702127659575

This film deals with just the business end of the Billy Graham Crusades as if it is a business only. Plus they use Charles Templeton, a well known agnostic, who cares more about criticizing Billy Graham's stand on faith as a childish belief and faith with no questions. In other words, Templeton, who the film refers to a lot, is calling Billy Graham a robotic idiot!
Any believer knows that no matter how hard the efforts of our frail humanity is, NOTHING can be accomplished or that revered except thru the miraculous ventures of the Holy Spirit. No one man could remain that faithful to God except he really was a follower of Someone higher than any man's efforts.

Acts 5: 33-39
""33When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.
""34Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
""35And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
""36For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.
""37After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
""38And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:
""39But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.""

7800767,5,0005164850,"This is one of the BEST videos produced about The life and ministry of Billy Graham I've ever seen. Randall Balmer  (not Robert) did a fantastic job asking questions of many of Mr. Graham's friends and acquaintances, and investigating his history and relationships with influential people. He asked questions that perhaps were somewhat uncomfortable for Mr. Graham but drew out of  the almost 2 hour program many little known facts, and at a time in his life when he was still very active.  The video was copyrighted in 1993, over 21 years ago.
 I thoroughly enjoy and still am inspired by the unchanging, straight-forward, simple and yet very powerful presentations of what the Bible says that  Billy Graham has given all around the world. Mr Louis Zamperini of the recent Movie and true story ""UNBROKEN""  has been a long time friend of  Billy Graham Ministries. It turns out that Mr  Zamperini's wife had caused her husband to attend a Billy Graham Crusade in Los Angeles in 1949 after he had returned home from the war as an angry and hateful man, but was transformed by the words he heard  at that Crusade. This DVD, ""CRUSADE, The Life of Billy Graham"", is a video you really won't want to miss especially since Mr Graham is still alive, he truly is a legend from the 1930's to the current day.",1429228800,,1298,4.657894736842105

7800770,1,0005164850,"I pulled the DVD out of the player halfway through this documentary.  Why?  Because PBS can't help working its secular, progressive rhetoric into everything.  PBS is anything but unbiased in its reporting.  The greatest evangelist this world has ever seen deserves a better presentation of accomplishments than this unauthorized ""biography.""  If you really wish to know Billy Graham better, I would suggest God's Ambassador, hosted by Sir David Frost.",1392595200,7,451,5.478260869565218
