Saddledome
Calgary, Alberta, Canada

My version of this has the Free For All Match bewteen the New Blackjacks and Godwinns. The match sucks and the Godwinns won, but since it wasn't actually part of the PPV...I will get started...

Mankind V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley
good opener that had a cheap ending of a double countout *** and then you see them fight all over the beautiful saddledome. Calgary is one of the most beautiful cities i have ever been too. You should go sometime, you will love it

Great Sasuke V. Taka Michinoku
I saw tapes of the Great Sasuke from Japan and he must have been nervous because he looked nothing like himself. He won the match...but he just didn't like the Great Sasuke that I know and love. ***1/4

WWF Championship:
Undertaker (Champion) V. Vader
This match was actually suppose to be Undie taking on Ahmed Johnson, but Ahmed hurt himself...again and they put Vader in the match. One...This match was better with Vader in there than Ahmed and second...this match was a whole lot better than their Rumble match. Undie wins. ***1/2

Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, British Bulldog, & Brian Pillman
V.
Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, & Legion Of Doom
Aweosme match that ending out of no where with owen rolling up austin. I think it could have been better it they prolonged the ending for a few more minutes. But, who cares?...The match was still awesome and fun to watch. ****1/4

Overall, only a four match show but four matches that were solid and very fun to watch.",1138752000,,1566,4.676363636363637

This is another repackaged IN Your House PPV that was set in Calgary, Alberta Canada. Bret Hart was on his anti-American rant which suited his hometown crowd. The Hart family was WAAYYYY over in this match. It's sad that 3/5 of the Hart team has passed away (Owen, Bulldog & Pillman). Check out this rare find.",1077494400,,640,4.573913043478261
