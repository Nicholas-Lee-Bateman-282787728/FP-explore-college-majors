3851388,5,B002665I94,"This movie blew me away. It was full of twists and it was really dramatic. I'd say the romance part of the movie is unrequited. The poetry was stunning along with the actors. Scott was amazing. The movie sort of has you on the edge the entire time. It got slow in the middle, but the ending had to be my favorite part. Great film. *****",1256860800,7,336,4.106060606060606
3851389,5,B002665I94,"I just watched this movie on On Demand and I thought it was great! The story was a mix of heart warming and sad. It was really good. The performances were pretty damn good as well, expecially by Scott Michael Foster. Definately going to buy this. I swear if I was in the right mood, I probably would've cried a little.

3851405,5,B002665I94,"It's been five years since I first came across this film and it haunts me still in the most beautiful way. Regina has done an amazing job with this film, brilliant! To think this was based on true events furthers the intrigue of this touching story. There's no way you won't be able to relate in some way to one of the characters. No way you won't find yourself cheering, or crying, smiling or waiting with baited breath for a particular outcome you hope to see.

3851409,5,B002665I94,"A truly gripping film that captures the hopes, frustrations, despair, and confusion that can confound the lives of high school aged students in America.  It also demonstrates the impact both abuse and neglect can have on an entire family.  While some might be quick to dismiss the reality put on display by the filmmaker as being contrived, I might caution against such judgments as there is much to be learned from such a cautionary tale.

3851426,5,B002665I94,"I have watched this movie so many times that I might need to check into a movie watcher's rehab. I just happened to come across this movie one day by chance and fell in love with it. This movie will actually touch your heart.
Scott Michael Foster played the character of Thayer so brilliantly. My heart ached for this character. It really makes you stop and think about people around you who are exhibiting the same behavior and makes you wonder if they are crying out for help. This movie gives a perfect example of the saying, ""never judge a book by it's cover.""
Plus, the soundtrack to this movie is awesome. I was searching for the songs and the artists on the internet when I finished watching the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",1374364800,7,762,4.528985507246377
3851427,5,B002665I94,"I feel that people don't give this film enough credit. You have to have an open mind and be willing to accept the characters as they are. I thought this movie was eccentric,sad, and beautiful at the same time.  Spoiler alert!!! It killed me that they never even kissed or were able to profess their love. Maybe this, is what made the movie that  much more intriguing to me. I felt the leads did a fantastic job. Wish there were more films like this, that leave you emotionally attached and wanting more from the story.",1373068800,3,518,4.442105263157894

I loved this movie.",1363651200,2,301,4.206896551724138
3851431,5,B002665I94,"This movie, although a indie film is quite a good story, and is filmed on location in my home town, and in my old school! It was a thrill to identify local landmarks and the same classrooms I studied in.",1360368000,2,203,4.1
3851432,5,B002665I94,"I was intrigued when I saw the trailer for Teenage Dirtbag, but I did expect to see the film enact a lot of angsty high school romance cliches. The plot, which follows how the original disdain between a popular cheerleader and a notorious ""problem kid"" turns into (grudging, and entirely socially unacceptable) attraction, can superficially sound like the plot of hundreds of other movies. So I was floored when the film unfolded to be among the most original and sublime I've seen.

Bonus commentary from the director and producer notes that the film's rapid shooting (it was all shot in about 20 days) resulted in a few continuity errors. These ultimately prove to be noticeable, but extremely forgivable. The production value is nothing to write home about, on its own; director Regina Crosby, also a supporting actress in the film, apparently kept it on a ""shoestring budget"" to avoid having to compromise with financer's influences. But the more down-to-earth feel of the film proves to be a boon that highlights the graceful acting and editing of this movie. The two leads act their complex characters especially beautifully. But really: I think the way Scott M. Foster portrayed the troubled Thayer, complemented so intensely by the unyielding Amber, will haunt me for a very long time. Perhaps even longer than that wonderful yet frustratingly enigmatic ending.",1360022400,5,1369,5.084444444444444
3851433,5,B002665I94,"""Based on true events""... It's a thought provoking movie, very moving. It just brings you back to high school again, whatever your age... Amazing.",1357862400,3,146,5.125
3851434,4,B002665I94,"I once showed ""Teenage Dirtbag"" to a college class of freshman-level English Composition students. While none of them absolutely loved it, it kept the entire class in rapt attention, and no one complained that it was just ""stupid"" or ""boring,"" which is noteworthy. They found Amber Lange and Thayer Mangeress two very well-realized characters, and Amber's poignant closing lines produced a flurry of involuntary hums and sighs. One guy noted that it had a low budget feel, and that he would have liked more special effects, changes in scenery, and everything else that one gets from larger company productions. Duly noted, but I think the lowbudgetness also adds to the simple realism of the film. What my class found most intriguing were the open questions and room for speculation ""Teenage Dirtbag"" leaves regarding what really happens to Thayer's father and brother.

""Teenage Dirtbag"" may not be anything truly special, but it accomplishes what its makers set out to do very well: Taut and gripping storyline with excellent acting and characterization. Several years after seeing it, this film remains quite fresh in my mind.",1346371200,3,1129,5.169398907103825
3851435,5,B002665I94,I watched this movie the first thime at a sleepover a few months ago and it had a huge impact on me. It was such a powerful movie. I can relate to the movie and since I've seen it I've watched it several times and want to buy it on DVD soon. It was just soooo good. The ending kind of annoyed me cuz I know if I was here I wouldn't have done what she did. Thayer and her belonged together and she knew it but wouldn't admit to it and because of that she had to suffer bu what happened. I totally recommend this movie! Everyone needs to watch it!,1318204800,3,545,3.875
3851436,4,B002665I94,"I first saw this movie on cable and after watching it 2 times I decided to purchase it for my home collection. I love indie films and this was a really great one. Scott Michael Foster the lead actor is not only extremely talented but so adorable in this role. He really makes you want to love him and makes you want to shake his love interest and say ""can't you see how wonderful this person is"". I especially love the way he protects his sister. He dosen't care about how others perceive him and that is his best quality. He is just this broken boy with a dysfunstional and crazy home life who wants to be loved. It really teaches you to not judge others and even though we come from different sides of the track it is possible to build relationships with someone who is not like us IF you allow yourself to. It's a story of love and regret and it really makes you think.",1314662400,6,872,4.196428571428571
3851437,5,B002665I94,"This movie is quietly devastating.  It grabs you so slowly you don't realize it's happening, and squeezes slowly to the end.

3851443,4,B002665I94,"I came across this movie on a whim, I had no expectations about it. I found it entertianing and suprizingly addictive. There were a lot of things borderline amateurish and undefined about the movie. But despite all the things I could try to say against this movie. The movie makers must have done something right because I still like it enough that I plan to buy it. It aggervates me but at the same time I have watched it about four times within a week. I can't tell you why I keep coming back to it, but I do, and I still react to it everytime. It hasn't gotten boring yet, the parts that were shocking, gross, and sad; the first time around still get to me now.  Its by no means a block buster hit, but it has the potential to be a perfect cult movie like The Breakfast Club.",1295827200,10,778,4.152317880794702

3851453,3,B002665I94,"Teenage Dirtbag isn't a particularly good film.  The storytelling seriously doesn't contain much in the way of excitement the entire time.  It's a VERY slow-moving storyline from start to finish.

It's about a teenage cheerleader who forms a relationship with a troubled teenage boy at school.  The way the relationship develops is really strange, and that in itself had potential (because it was different, at least) but because of the slow-moving nature of the entire film, any development here felt more like a chore to pay attention to instead of containing any kind of interesting storyline progression.

The boy tries to win over the cheerleader by eating and drinking really strange things as a way to show off I guess, but the girl isn't impressed by *any* of this in the least.  Instead she's grossed out (as she should be).  Eventually during a study hall class, the boy begins hitting off a relationship with the girl by passing her notes and asking questions in the notebook, and she responds to them (which prompts a constant back and forth notebook-passing game during study hall).

It turns out the boy comes from an abusive family.  We see some interesting scenes involving the boy and his father getting into a few fights.  Even though it appears like the cheerleader was aware of this (because the boy even shows her the marks on his side where his father had been hitting him) she didn't seem to care or feel any kind of concern or worry whatsoever.  This felt like awkward writing to me because the girl most definitely SHOULD have cared about him by this point.

Now what would've been interesting had been if the cheerleader turned out to have a rocky relationship with her parents as well.  One scene shows the cheerleader being told to go tie a rope correctly (concerning a boat near a dock) and this scene was immediately shown after we find out the boy is being abused by his family.  Would have been a significant storyline improvement had BOTH the cheerleader and the boy fallen in love with each other with both of them having to deal with abusive parents.

Anyway, the writing severely hurt what potentially could have been an above average storyline.  As it stands, it's just a decent film.",1279584000,3,2221,4.759791122715405
3851454,4,B002665I94,"Just got done watching this movie and I am kind of reeling from the potency.  I feel like I might need to watch it again to fully appreciate it.  But, here's my initial reaction:  the two leads are phenomenal - couldn't have had better actors in those roles, the music pulls at you, the story is intriguing and the poetry is pretty beautiful.  The theme song, if there is one, I have a feeling is by Sigur Ros, a Swedish band, that creates beautiful, haunting music.  That's how I would describe this movie in a nutshell.  It is a beautiful, sad and haunting story of a couple of kids - who didn't quite know what to do with a strong and powerful connection.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone that has a thoughtful mind and is intrigued by the human experience.  You are definitely left thinking and wondering, not only about how it ends, but what it's like to experience that kind of random, heart-wrenching chemistry.",1274832000,8,921,4.506024096385542
3851455,4,B002665I94,"Scott M. Foster delivers an amazing performance as a somber and kind of psychotic teen. Noa Hegesh played the smart yet conflicted cheerleader down to a T, showing that even among the in-crowd you can still be an outsider. Unrequited love, which is usually interesting, and a non-clich ending (which is very much open to interpretation).

The most significant adult in the film is their creative writting teacher (the around which most of the movie is centered), and I've read that the movie is somewhat autobiographical so I felt it did it justice because most people did have a teacher in high school who got them to change or grow up a little (I know I did). It also tried to turn a few stereotypes around.

Three time lines occur in the film, which can be confusing at times, but I understood what was going on pretty easily.

The storyline takes some pretty unexpected twists and it's got plenty of intense scenes and situations. I recommend it.",1274486400,3,950,4.676646706586826
3851456,3,B002665I94,"Well, if you read my title it's really all you need to know about my feelings on this movie. I somehow caught the ending credits of this film one day flipping through channels and really sunk-in with the super-melancholy Casey Frazier song ""Elysian Fields"" ...I was sold -without ever seeing 1 minute of footage from the actual film. I began looking for another showing on TV and that didn't happen so I started to research what other people were saying about the film. I d-o consider this more a ""film"" than a ""movie"" because of the more ""low-budget, independent"" place that the material comes from. As my title suggests, I think the acting was fine, but the writing and the actual piecing together of the film seems to jump around a bit as though a very young person was trying to impress the audience by trying something different. I applaud their effort, but this time, at least in my opinion this strategy did not transfer well in the film.

I have seen films that document abuse of all kinds and I've seen many, many ""young love"" or ""School life"" types of films so the things that would make an impression on many first-time viewers approaching these topics might come away with a better rating. But I had to give this film only 3 stars because there were alot of the same ""young people"" topics that show-up in this category of film. The thing that most made this film different was the style in which it was put together and as I said before this was not I think as effective as the director or possibly the original writer was hoping. And because the film depended so highly on it's uniqueness from the way it was cut together and this method fell on it's face some in the hopes to come off more artistic; it brought me to the thought that this film deserved a re-do.

I was feeling a bit let down when I finally came to the credits I had seen so many days before. The film did not sit with me and make me think after it was over as I think it should have.  I feel the potential is there to bring out something better. As it stands, from my perspective.. the best part of the film is the first song at the end of the film, when the screen turns black...",1272758400,4,2161,4.330864197530865
3851457,2,B002665I94,"""Teenage Dirtbag"" is one of those movies that's intentionally oblique; where several key plot and character elements are left fairly open-ended, very possibly in expectation that the audience will think, ""Because I can only half-understand it, it must have a good amount of meaning."" A movie maker or movie-making team has to have some legit creative talent to pull this type of film off. Even with a very low budget, raw talent can still be very evident in a movie, but that's not the case here. What you have instead is choppiness. To boot, there's a ""give-me-a-break"" scene in which a man portrayed to be an inspirational teacher attempts to evoke his students' creativity by lying down on the classroom floor and getting the class to lie down as well. This sadly mirrors the well-known ""Dead Poet's Society"" scene in which Robin Williams, as the same type of teacher, stands on his desk, jumps off, and then prods his students to come up and do the same. Even if this wasn't a conscious rip-off, the writer should have had the sense of awareness to realize that this is how the scene could easily have been perceived, and that such a scene can instantly pull audience members out of the story and into the reality realm of being fully aware that they're simply watching and listening to actors. It's unfortunate, because the plot of a young guy and a young girl from opposite social castes but nonetheless developing a bond, very possibly an attraction, is certainly a very well-liked storyline.",1268092800,5,1499,4.7915057915057915

Because of social status, Amber is held back from acknowledging her feelings for Thayer, yet he never waivers in his feelings towards her and attempts several times to get her to say it or at least write it down.  We are left with the idea that maybe somehow Thayer physically survived and even if he didn't, the story ending gives hope that another Thayer will continue, physically and spiritually.
