781377,3,630409874X,This is not one of the heard about Cher movies. But it is a good one. Funny in spots and makes you happy at the end to see how it turns out. If you are a Cher fan it is worth getting to add to your collection. I saw it originally in the movie theatre and was happy to see it out on dvd.,1281398400,,286,3.484375
781378,3,630409874X,"Based on a play by the guy who plays the hitman in this short movie, this doesn't have a lot of action, though it does have a few mildly entertaining plot twists. The movie format allows for a few flashbacks to be fleshed out. None of the characters are very sympathetic. Cher, in 1996 when this was made, had just had her lips plumped. Ryan O'Neill still looked less bloated than he was to become. I had to pause this at least half a dozen times and go do other things because I got bored by the tedium of the script. The end is total anticlimax. An average watch for an off night.",1267315200,,582,4.15929203539823
781379,3,630409874X,"This is not a movie I would suggest for everyone, but good to watch on a lazy afternoon or something like that.",1255824000,,111,4.090909090909091
781380,3,630409874X,"It was an okay movie, but most parts came over kind of weird. And the chronology of the scenes were messed up. Or something.

IT was really confusing to watch, and I was kind of disapointed. The acting was great, but the script or just the whole movie was just lacking something.

And the ending for me just plain sucked. It was so plain and..I don't know, unsatisfying. Thw whole thing would have been better as a play. Which was what it started out as,right?",1249430400,,460,4.4
781381,5,630409874X,"Confusion reigns. I was about to buy the fun movie with my favorite actor, Chazz the Jazz, and who in the heck are these stand in actors anyway? No Chazz, no Ryan, lucky to have Cher?
If we are selling pirates, who  done in the oh so clever scriptwriter/actor, Chazz? And  ohhhhhh,Chazz, where are you now?",1231200000,,306,4.446428571428571
781382,4,630409874X,"I agree with several other Amazon  reviewers this movie is underrated.  I cannot understand why for example, Leonard Maltin's  professional reviewer  accords it only two stars.

The title tells all:  it is a film that  is basically about  what does it take to label somebody as being unfaithful? At one point Margaret -Cherilyn Sarkisian  or ""Cher""- challenges the  mafia's hit man Tony -Chazz Palminteri- whom somebody has hired to kill her when he admits to be ""rather unfaithful"" with  ""What do you mean? You are either  faithful or unfaithful?"". "" Tony's definition of  not having sex  in a sexual relationship  is similar  to Bill Clinton's.

Unlike Moonstruck, however, Faithful  is not Oscar material (although I can easily  think of some Oscar winners of poorer quality than this movie) but strangely enough  Cher does a better job  as Margaret in this film  than even  in her outstanding performance in Moonstruck  in which she co-starred with a rather blah Nicholas Cage. Perhaps because her role and lines here  are better despite  the  movie being much  less skilfully structured than in Moonstruck. The criticism that it is based on a stage  play that doesn't translate so well on the screen is invalid. Films such as Kenneth Branagh's  Henry V and Al Pacino's The Merchant of Venice,  as well as the older ""The Importance of Being  Ernest"" of Anthony Asquith were all originally stage dramas but  still went well when adapted to the screen.

I first saw a bit of this film on TV some years ago when we were set to go out for dinner and it was already well in progress so there was no point in taping it. A few days ago it came up on TV again  I  recorded it in case we got drowsy (like most good films shown on  Greek TV channels it began at 11 pm). However, we managed  to stay awake and I am certainly going to see it again now I have the tape. Warning: the film is rather flat for the first 30 or so minutes with Cher doing a good job but Chazz Palminteri taking rather long to ease  into his role as the reluctant  neurotic hit man.  ( Incidentally surely Amazon has erred in not listing Chazz as one of the actors despite his key role  in Faithful but has several  comparatively unknown persons shown who only briefly appear? I mean Chazz not only co-stars with Cher and O'Neal  but was a co-writer and co-producer of the movie!)  From then on the film builds up with several twists, turns and red herrings  in the plot. I agree with one remark that the  tacked on epilogue is blah and unnecessary, it should be edited out for the next DVD release and relegated to the deleted scenes  part of the bonus material.

Yes this is not an action movie. So if you have had a bad day in the office and need to relax with  a good no-brainer don't watch it tonight. The film's value is mainly in the word exchanges  in a very  dry humour suitable for  a black melodrama (comedy is a bit misleading). We laughed at many points,- much more times  than in many a so-called  screen comedy-  but not to the extent that we were rolling on the floor. A pure light and  absurd  comedy such as Danny Kaye's in The Court Jester classic  is needed to produce that result in our household. Earlier the  same evening I'd watched the constant and rather comic action film Red Heat starring Arnold  Schwarzennegger  and  James Belushi,  so we needed to view something  somewhat more cerebral  late at night. I agree with some other  Amazon reviewers that  the film merits a second viewing once the plot is unravelled by the first screening  to really appreciate what is going on in the Cher-Palminteri-O'Neal triangle. If you want to watch an enjoyable movie  that demands your attention and respects your intelligence, this is it. But be relaxed first. It's like enjoying a  fine wine or single malt whiskey, and has to be taken and savoured  sip by sip.",1221609600,,3849,4.531478770131772
781383,4,630409874X,"I really liked this film,and I wasn't bored,but it could have been a classic with some changes,and the acting was great,especially Cher. This could have been her second Oscar. I'm going to watch this DVD again tonight.",1134172800,4,218,4.918918918918919
781384,4,630409874X,"I give this movie 4 stars, but in the right frame of mine it's a definite 5!  It's one of those films that needs to be viewed several times.  Although not very successful, and with basically no support from Cher, I find the movie well written...can get a little wordy...and well acted.  Enjoyed for it's ""simpleness"" FAITHFUL is fun in it's own way.  It can be sad and slightly twisted!  (The telephone calls between Chaz's character with his Shrink are a riot!).  But for the most part, this film was a welcome return of Cher to the big screen!  Almost 5 stars in spite of itself.",1116547200,,581,4.4245283018867925
781385,5,630409874X,"This movie satisfies.  It has elements of mystery, overcoming pain and defeating a sneaky villain.  The viewer gets to laugh and feel that a person can win without giving up too much. The story is rich and remains in the mind afterward.",1110672000,,236,4.595238095238095
781466,3,630409874X,"THIS IS THE ONLY CHER MOVIE THAT I ONLY SAW ONCE. CERTAINLY,NOT HER BEST. SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS SLEEPWALKING THROUGH THE ROLE & THE MATERIAL WAS LACKLUSTER. I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HER SITTING IN A CHAIR THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE. SHE NEEDS A WIDE ARENA TO SHINE & THIS MOVIE DIDN'T PROVIDE IT.",1088121600,,298,4.339285714285714
781467,4,630409874X,"I would love to rate this 5 stars but I'm an equal opportunity Cher fan.  To begin with as other reviewers have remarked, this film - originally produced off Broadway by Palmienteri (who at the time was hot from ""The Usual Suspects"") does not translate as well to the screen.  The wordy script, however, gives Cher some great lines and she really carries the film.  It is a very interestingly written screenplay (it varies drastically from the original show) and once again there were rumours of trouble on the set between Cher and Mazursky, the director.  The ending and last shot is so obviously stapled on - something Cher was so angry about you can actually see her seething in the scene while she is in the car.  And she has good reason - the film reaches a crescendo and then BOOM just falls flat.  Cher's performance is wonderful and emotive; unfortunately her recently ""touched up lips"" shall I say - are hard to ignore in many scenes.  (I don't know what she did, however I rode up in an elevator with her back in February and she looked amazing).  Ryan O'Neal, as well, is bloated - so there is a desperation of the aging Hollywood actor feel about the film.  However, in an odd sense that all actually works very well with the theme of ""out with the old"" that is O'Neal's character's motivation and Cher's character's desperation as well.  A very enjoyable and underrated film.",1086220800,20,1388,4.582995951417004
781468,4,630409874X,"from the beggining this movie has a great soundtrack and a beautiful suburb.as for chazz palminteri who played a hired mafia,is such a brilliant actor together with cher.the two actors makes this movie looks like a comedy at times and it can keep you laughing always.this is an enjoyable movie and a must see for all.",1059868800,,317,4.678571428571429
781469,5,630409874X,"Unlike the other reviewers, this under rated and overlooked film put Cher in fine form. She adequately went through the paces of a depressed and suicidal wife to an assertive and in-control woman by the films end.
Anyone who has ever been in a long term relationship will find that their thoughts have been placed in full view on the screen. This was superbly written and acted by Chaz Palmitari who enhanced Cher's performance.
It seemed odd to cast Ryan O'Neal as the slimy husband, but he did manage to pull it off with the accurate yuppie whining headset that the role demanded.
If your heart has been broken or is currently in the throes of a disintegrating relationship, this film is a MUST see! Many introspective ideas will come to the forefront that you may not have considered before.
Rent it if you must, but it is certainly one of those films worthy of a purchase as well as repeat viewings.",1053734400,12,903,4.580246913580247
781470,3,630409874X,"...it doesn't quite work, but it's okay right? All the tools are presented to put together a pretty good movie. Paper flat direction by Paul Mazursky is the real let down with this play turned film. No sweat!! Cher and Chazz Palminteri hold things together. Palminteri's script makes many good points, but some how shoots for a degree of shock value that makes for some dialogue that can be a little more hardcore than one might of expected. Thats cool though I haven't heard Cher talk like that since ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1987). Some traditional married folk may find themselves offended. This movie was often halarious and insane in it's honesty. Bottomline..for those that love Cher and expect the magic of ""Moonstruck"", ""Mermaids"", ""Mask"", or ""Tea with Mussolini"". You won't find it with ""Faithful"".",1041811200,8,809,5.0
781471,5,630409874X,"""Faithful"" is something between a thriller and a comedy, although not quite. Its script, due to the long dialogues and less action, would work better on the stage as on the screen. Nevertheless the performances are really charming. Cher, as usual, does the best out of her character, and Chazz Palminteri is just born for the gangster role. And although there's something freaky in this film, it is really very enjoyable.",1024876800,6,421,4.943661971830986
781472,3,630409874X,"This was better than I expected. Chazz Palminteri plays a hit man set to kill Cher, and who was sent by her husband, played by Ryan O'Neal. But then once Chazz starts to talk to her, they seem to have this snappy discourse.  (He can't just kill her - he's waiting for a phone call from the husband.)  This isn't more than a nice-looking play (great house in Harrison, NY), and  it's not suspenseful at all, but Palminteri's charm carries it nicely.",963878400,3,448,4.439024390243903
781473,4,630409874X,"Not an Oscar movie, but I enjoyed it.  I'm a huge Cher fan, and she did a great job, allthough the script was pretty weak.  If you want a real quality Cher movie, I suggest Moonstruck oor Tea with Mussolini.  If you  just want something entertaining, this movie's alot of fun!",954460800,8,276,4.352941176470588
781474,4,630409874X,I SEEN THIS MOVIE TWICE AND I THINK THAT CHER AS USUALL DOES A OUTRAGEOUS JOB. THIS MOVIE KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION ALL THE WAY TILL THE END,953337600,,135,4.037037037037037

7861822,5,630409874X,"I watched this on television, not knowing a thing about it. Oh my gosh.  It was so funny I had to buy the DVD so I can watch it as often as I like!  This is one of the most hysterical movies with Cher that I've ever seen.  She basically does all her acting tied to a chair - now that's talent!  Chazz Palminteri is the perfect bad guy here.  You don't really see Ryan O'Neal much until toward the end but he's diamond, too.  This is a comedy and if you haven't seen it - get it!!",1473984000,2,479,3.836734693877551

7861831,4,630409874X,Faithful was a great story.  The communication between Cher and the hitman sent to kill her was amusing.  The fact that the hitman has an analyst who knows what he does for a living was good.  It has a great ending.,1354233600,,215,4.195121951219512
