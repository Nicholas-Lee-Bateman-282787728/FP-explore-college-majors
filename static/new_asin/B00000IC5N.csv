1220587,4,B00000IC5N,"As most people will surmise, the very title of this DVD is a sardonic inside-joke.  The term ""wonderful life"" goes along with Kafka about as well as tropical vacations in Antartica.  When I first saw the title I knew I would not be able to resist buying this DVD - even if only out of curiousity.
The DVD is four short-stories set to film;  only the 1st one relates to Kafka.  In the title story there is an attempt to comically discern the nature of Kafka's inspiration for his famous short story, THE METAMORPHOSIS.  It's kind of like what they did with Shakespeare in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, only this time it's in a twisted Kafkaesque sort of way.
Of the rest of the production, stories 2 and 4 are so-so.  Story 3, however, called THE DEAL, is absolutely hilarious.  It pokes fun at 2 pompous CEOs who get together and make asinine decisions while untold thousands of jobs hang in the balance.  Anyone who has followed the scandals of ENRON, WORLDCOM, etc. will find this a refreshing satire.
I would recommend this DVD for all fans of Franz Kafka as well as people who like ""different"" sorts of short-stories.  Be forewarned, however, it's not altogether done in good taste.  If that does not bother you, then by all means put this one on your wish-list!",1063497600,21,1257,4.546666666666667
1220588,3,B00000IC5N,"Kafka is well known for the achievement of absurdity in his work.  It must be remembered, however, that Kafka's absurdity was not absurdity for its own sake, and though often comical, was nightmarish and profound.  The absurdity seen here, though clever and very funny, isn't what Kafka was about.  That doesn't at all discredit this short film, but it is important to make a distinction.",1059436800,7,388,4.938461538461539
1220589,5,B00000IC5N,"I have to speak in defense of ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life."" Yes, the idea of mixing Kafka and Capre is entirely absurd, but isn't that what makes it so incredibly Kafka? Kafka always used absurdity to depict the modern world, and I think he would have appreciated the short immensely for that (though the end was a bit shakey, but I guess that's what we have to give to Capre.) I loved this short, as well as the others on the DVD.",1014076800,4,440,4.25
1220590,5,B00000IC5N,"Beautifully filmed fantasy about the night Kafka wrote his masterpiece (not too far from the idea used so successfully in  ""Insignificance""), infused with hallmarks of the classic  ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Charming, smart, and bizarre, starring  Richard E. Grant, ""FKIAWL"" won the Oscar in 1993 for Best Live  Action Short. Brilliant!",967334400,9,334,5.490196078431373

7909902,3,B00000IC5N,"This is a collection of short films, of which the title film is the best by a long, long way.
Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life is a nicely grafted short feature about the writing of Kafka's most famous novella.
It's just the right length and tone for the material. Poor Franz! I wonder if he was really so gloomy!
The other films on the DVD are watchable, but you probably won't watch them again.",1379030400,,399,4.333333333333333
7909903,3,B00000IC5N,"With an amusing title and a talented cast, I expected more from this short (~25 minutes) film. I did chuckle during scenes where Gregor imagines he's turning into a banana and, later, a kangaroo, before finally settling on the cockroach imagery. But I found most of the rest too hard to follow.

More interesting and amusing were some of the other shorts that were part of the package, including one produced by angry comic Louis Black.",1367366400,,436,4.7368421052631575
7909904,5,B00000IC5N,"This Academy-Award winning short is literate, slyly intelligent and a real gem. A delightful convergence of icons of existential despair and of hope and redemption, with a goofy nod to Jeanette MacDonald & Nelson Eddy to boot.",1358380800,,226,5.135135135135135
7909905,2,B00000IC5N,"4 short films of about 20 minutes each. No unifying theme, just 4 surrealist exercises in film making with low production values. An hour and 20 minutes I will never get back.

Do not get hooked as I was by the title, it describes only the first short. I thought a mash-up of Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and Kafka's Metamorphosis would be unusual enough to be interesting. Wrong. The 2nd short was also tied in to Christmas, but that's the only similarity - Waiting for Godot while driving. 3rd short is absurdist anti-materialist dialogue (sort of dozed off for part of it), and the last one is actually a kind of sweet love story.

Bottom line - don't waste your time.",1353542400,3,674,4.516393442622951
7909906,3,B00000IC5N,"FRANZ KAFKA'S IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE AND OTHER STRANGE TALES is a DVD collection of four short films that were a part of Sundance in 1995.  These films are a mixed bag of absurdity, drama, comedy, and poignancy.

The first film on the DVD is the title feature of the DVD, ""FRANK KAFKA'S IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"".  The writings of Kafka and the films of Frank Capra express two worldviews that are almost completely polar opposite of each other.  This short film brings elements of both together to create an absurd little story that tells how Kafka was inspired to write his famous story, ""The Metamorphosis"".  This short won the 1995 Oscar for Best Short Film, Live Action.

The next short is entitled ""SEVEN GATES"".  Two brothers who live very different lives meet up together unexpectedly on the road home to their parent's for Christmas.  The family's driveway is incredibly long and the brothers have to open up seven different gates across the driveway in order to pass through.  Along the way they have a conversation.

The third short on the DVD is ""THE DEAL"".  Two of the world's most powerful businessmen meet together to discuss a joint project that will make the two men THE most powerful men on the planet.  A duel of witty banter becomes foreplay to the agreement that is ended by ""testifying"" to each other (if you know the origin of the word you'll understand).  After watching the short, I saw in the credits that this short was written by Lewis Black, the obnoxious comedian.  If you like his comedy, you will probably enjoy this short.  It's the only short of the four that would have been rated PG-13 or R.

The last short on the DVD is ""MR. McALLISTER'S CIGARETTE HOLDER"".  The film is based upon a short story by one of the lesser known writers of the American South, Mark Steadman.  The story is filmed in black and white tones and follows one Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister finds a metal cigarette holder while working in the fields one day.  It becomes his prized possession and seems a good luck charm that leads him to a beautiful albino girl, named Dora, that becomes his common law wife.  On a birthday trip to the beach with Dora, Mr. McAllister discovers something that shakes him to his core and is shown what true love really is.

I enjoy watching short films, but I have to admit that I only enjoyed two of the four films, ""FRANZ KAFKA'S IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"" and ""MR. MCALLISTER'S CIGARETTE HOLDER"".  ""SEVEN GATES"" has some touching moments, but it didn't do much for me and while ""THE DEAL"" is humorous, it's really nothing more than an extended punch-line drug out for almost twenty-five minutes.  This DVD isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy short films, you might want to check it out.",1223942400,5,2724,4.615384615384615
7909907,5,B00000IC5N,"Terrific alternative entertainment.  Four short film-festival favorites from Sundance 1995 that surely are worth more than anything at your local multi-plex. 84 minutes in total. Humor for grownups.

The eponymous first film, Franz Kafka's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, is absurdity upon absurdity, with terrific casting and acting.  Follow Franz Kafka's metamorphosis into Jimmy Stewart.  Sets the tone for the films to follow.

Of the four films, I found SEVEN GATES to be the best.  An eye-watering, funny satirical look at family, notably brotherhood.  I ran it several times just to see that sad-eyed hound dog Mr. Biggens watching the goosedown feathers float around the back of the car.  Dave Conrades and Floyd Clooney are featured in an amusing soundtrack. If you enjoyed ""Fargo"", this short will hit your funnybone in the same spot.

THE DEAL spoofs egomaniac CEOs, and is just ridiculous.  (Beware, it is not PG material.)

MR. McALLISTER'S CIGARETTE HOLDER doesn't really fit the humor of the first three, but makes for a watchable and creative short.",1203292800,3,1056,5.189349112426036
