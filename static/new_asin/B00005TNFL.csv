7953877,5,B00005TNFL,The documentary was exceptional. The histories of each of the musicians was very informative. The actual songs that were played shows the tremendous talent that these musicians have.,1367539200,,182,5.535714285714286
7953878,5,B00005TNFL,"I'm sure the genesis of Los Super Seven wasn't taking aim at BVSC, but I think  the creation of this videoespecially after the success of LSS' first albumdid take BVSC into account. S'ok, though... this is a top-notch production with musicians (and music!) that I've come to love (some as a direct result of watching this). After viewing, it became a no-brainer to also buy a couple of LSS CDs.",1363305600,,394,4.628571428571429
7953879,5,B00005TNFL,It was amazing!  I wish they had made a video of their first album; I would have bought that one also.,1345766400,,102,3.857142857142857
7953880,5,B00005TNFL,"I knew little about hispanic music before buying Los Lobos recordings and the first two Super Seven cd's. This dvd is pure excellence. It shows the musicians working hard to come up with the right arrangements to back up as fantastic a group of vocalists as you will find on any dvd. No two voices alike and thrown in are two representatives of South America, Caetano Veloso, a great favorite of mine, and Susana Baco from Peru. The dvd includes studio and live performance footage and it is hard to beat the joy that comes from watching musicians making excellent music together. I read that the third Super Seven cd dissapoints some, but I can say the first two and this dvd should hit the spot.",1203120000,3,697,4.5396825396825395
