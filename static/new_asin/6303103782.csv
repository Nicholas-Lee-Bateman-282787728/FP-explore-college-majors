561593,5,6303103782,"ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO MARS is the Greatest ABBOTT & COSTELLO film of all time. It is so full of love,at times it is remanesant of Laurel & Hardy in BABES IN TOYLAND. GO TO MARS begins with the bungling premise that if Abbott & Costello could fly a blasting firey Rocketship into orbit,that they would certainly not land on Mars,but instead think that only they did. Landing in New Orleans during the Mardi Gras season,and mistaking the inhabitants of New Orleans to be MARTIANS with their giant head costumes is shere and utter genious. Remember poor Lou trying to remove his helmet to breathe the Martian air,only to find out that it smells like limburger cheese????? It is very very cute. Then they get to visit another planet,called Venus,full of beautiful young girls!!! WOW!!!!! ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO MARS also benefits richly from a beautiful music score,peppy and full of life,similar to the type music eventually used in ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE KEYSTONE KOPS. It is a beautiful rich film,and like so many masterpieces with various faults,it constantly gets picked at by critics. Need I remind any of you,that it is one of the last good good Abbott &  Costello movies before poor Lou began another boute with rumatic fever. Love the flesh colored costumes on girls from Venus as well. WOOO WOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO MARS is a gem. Right in line with the greatest Martian comedy of all....Ray Walston and John L. Greene's ""MY FAVORITE MARTIAN"". Well....this is MY FAVORITE Abbott and Costello. Let's ROCKET AND ROLL with Bud and Lou. It truly is a fun film,and highly highly recommened. Hey lady....DUCK....... David Vass. Babes In Toyland.",1015545600,4,1671,4.859649122807017

After several days of weightlessness, the four space travellers land on Venus, a planet populated by the gorgeous winners of the Miss Universe contest (including Anita Ekberg).

7837756,4,6303103782,"ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO MARS is another suitably ridiculous adventure for our favorite ding-a-ling duo. In spite of the title, Bud and Lou never actually make it to the red planet. They go to Venus instead..., eventually. First, they must become involved in a zany plot that will get them there. Of course, this requires our heroes to be ""accidentally"" trapped aboard an experimental rocket. Hilarity ensues. As always, nothing is serious, and there's no reason to expect any real story-line. The boys wind up flying to New Orleans, mistaking it for Mars, just in time for Mardi Gras! There, they get entangled w/ a pair of daffy crooks. One of whom is sci-fi / Mars-movie veteran Jack Kruschen (WAR OF THE WORLDS, ANGRY RED PLANET)! Soon, the four astro-nuts are off to spaaaace! Next stop, Venus, where we discover that it's -blessedly- inhabited by an army of bodacious females (played by a gaggle of Miss Universe contestants). Among them, is a young Anita Ekberg (FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE FRENCH SEX MURDERS, THE KILLER NUN)! A&CGTM is packed w/ harmless, goofy fun...",1467417600,2,1078,4.832432432432433

7837758,4,6303103782,"In one of their better 1950s features, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are headed on a little interplanetary trip. But first, there's a little sidebar where the lovable duo land their spaceship in New Orleans in the middle of Mardi Gras--and of course, Bud and Lou think they have landed on Mars.

Meanwhile, 2 crooks who just busted out of the clink, find their way onboard the ship, steal a ray gun and hold up a bank and clothing store. Of course, it won't be long before the crooks and A & C come together and thanks to Costello, blast off to the planet of Venus.

And what a planet Venus turns out to be--inhabited by some very shapely bathing beauties. Certainly, these are the best looking ""aliens"" you will come across in a Hollywood movie.

And the pleasing aesthetics of the planet Venus lead to Bud, Lou and the crooks getting banished back to Earth, where they receive a heroes welcome and a ticker tape parade.

Overall, while the title of this film is rather confusing--maybe someone at Universal thought that ""Abbott and Costello go to Venus"" didn't have a great ring to it. Regardless, ""Mars"" is a good way to while away over an hour of your life.

7837759,1,6303103782,"Many years ago, I saw a fairly amusing Castle Films abridgement of ""Abbott and Costello Go to Mars"" (1953). Only recently did I sit through the entire movie. Needless to say, the nine-minute Castle version remains far superior. Bud and Lou actually land on Venus, but the tired feature goes nowhere at a snail's pace. Perhaps the team's worst film.",1341187200,2,348,4.816666666666666

7837761,3,6303103782,"Orville is pretending to fly a model airplane to entertain some orphans. Something goes wrong and Orville hides in a truck. But there is a mistake in identification. The space ship has been completed, it remains to be tested. Supplies are loaded by Lester and Orville. The boys accidentally start the rocket and take-off. The scenes of the rocket flight are amusing. It flies through the Lincoln Tunnel but does not pay a toll! The rocket lands near New Orleans. When they go exploring two escaped convicts find the rocket ship. The space suits are mistaken for Mardi Gras outfits. [The speech tells something about popular culture.] The two convicts don space suits to rob a bank. Who will be blamed? The militia and citizens are searching the city.

The escaped convicts are on the rocket ship, and it flies off again. This time to Venus, according to the slide rule. Orville discovers the inhabitants of Venus in the palace. [Who keeps it clean?] The story becomes a farce. Orville becomes king, then is deposed. They will be sent back to earth. After they land there is a ticker tape parade, with one last joke.",1202860800,,1115,4.717948717948718
7837762,3,6303103782,Abbott & Costello Go To Mars is a very amusing movie.  Children will love this picture...I did when I was a child.  It's very lighthearted...not so funny for the adult audience...but nevertheless should be referred to as a classic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The only reason I don't give it a better star rating is because it could've been funnier...not too many laugh out loud sequences but certainly plenty of amusement.  A movie the whole family can sit and watch together.,1072483200,,483,4.841463414634147

Long considered the team's worst film, Abbott and Costello Go to Mars is rather likeable in its own way. The slapstick humor is a little dated at times, but it will still tickle your funny bone. A decent flick to watch on a Saturday afternoon.",1032998400,5,1253,4.800925925925926
