330707,5,6301480392,"Granada's take on The Copper Beeches is a masterly effort, with Jeremy Brett in excellent form and David Burke similarly superb.  The marvellous, eerie story is handled beautifully by the creative team, Bill Craig's  adaptation being true to the original and maintaining a maximum of  suspense.  Joss Ackland's performance is terrific, and Natasha Richardson  makes her mark wonderfully.  Altogether a splendid outing for the Granada  team.",932601600,4,440,5.575757575757576
330708,5,6301480392,"The first episode of Granada's 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' broke the mould, with Jeremy Brett offering a highly original and brilliantly thought out portrayal of Holmes, sweeping away other interpretations in his  wake.  He brought a new and definitive idea of Holmes to the screen: his  performance shows that Holmes has depths that cannot be fathomed, perhaps  even by Brett himself. Watson was similarly reinvented by a splendid David  Burke, later to be equally well played by Edward Hardwicke.  Productions  values were high, and supporting casts were always from the top drawer.  It  was a classic series, cut short by Brett's untimely death in 1995.  This  first episode amply reveals what made the project so special.",932428800,3,733,5.17948717948718
330729,5,6301480392,"One of the few people who ever out-smarted Sherlock Holmes just happened to be a woman.  That is why ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" works so well.  Unless you are familiar with one of the most well-known and well-speculated Holmes stories, the ending will come as a surprise to you.  I have not seen all the Granada episodes of Sherlock Holmes, but their first entry comes out of the gates at warp-speed.  Highly recommend this to anyone.",1010016000,,430,4.618421052631579
330730,5,6301480392,"After coming across a copy of another Granada episode (The Bruce-Partington Plans) in a local store, I've been slowly accumulating the tapes of other episodes, most recently The Solitary Cyclist, which was one of my favorites of Conan Doyle's stories.
As always, Granada and Jeremy Brett deliver. I adore Brett; no other actor has come close to portraying Sherlock Holmes nearly so faithfully or so fascinatingly as he has. Brett's Holmes is frequently not at /all/ a likeable person (a fact illustrated with particular clarity in this episode), any more than Doyle's original was. What he /is/ is brilliant, intriguingly dramatic, and endearingly eccentric, with occasional flashes of compassion and sensitivity.
It's very difficult to steal a scene either from Brett or from Holmes himself, and no one pulls it off in The Solitary Cyclist. David Burke is a good, dependable Watson who can't help but be left in Holmes' intellectual dust, but is far from the phlegmatic simpleton that other actors have portrayed the character as (coughNigelBrucecough). Also notable are Barbara Wilshere as a confident and capable Violet Smith, John Castle playing Bob Carruthers with understated dignity, and Michael Siberry as the positively skin-crawlingly slimy Mr. Woodley.
As I've come to expect from Granada, the episode is a faithful rendering of the original story, with a large amount of the dialogue nearly verbatim, and painstaking attention to period detail.
Favorite moments:
Holmes' pained response to his chemical experiment being interrupted, against the combined forces of the immovable Mrs. Hudson and the adamant Miss Smith. And Holmes' subsequent rather gentle handling of Miss Smith, particularly his examination (with only a passing request for permission) of her hand and authoritative displaying to Watson of ""a certain spirituality in the face,"" and the soft delivery of the refrain, ""I never guess."" I love Jeremy Brett's voice.
Holmes sniping at Watson over his ""failure""--he's really horrible, and I can't help but love it. Especially towards the end of the discussion: ""Did I really do remarkably badly?"" ""...Yes!""
The impromptu boxing match with Woodley, and Holmes' gloating to Watson afterwards. (""It was absolutely delicious. A straight left against a slogging ruffian."")
The falling action, in which Holmes lays out the entire plot to Watson and two of the erstwhile conspirators as though he'd known everything all along.
And the last scene--the positively childish trick with the newspaper, and the sudden scramble to the window after the mishap with the chemical reaction.",1009324800,5,2595,5.378378378378378
330731,4,6301480392,"This is a fast moving, suspenseful, finale to Conan Doyle's long running series (or is it?).  Like The Hound, The Final Problem combines beautiful scenery (albeit the Swiss Alps instead of the English countryside)with a great story.  The sequence of Moriarty and Holmes in the latter's rooms on Baker Street is unforgettable as is the climax at Reichenbach Falls. A must for any fan of this series.",1007078400,,398,4.925373134328358
330732,5,6301480392,Mr. Brett was the finest Sherlock Holmes ever!! He created the escents and mannerism that are that of Holmes. Every case I have seen is truly a winning performance. You cannot go wrong with any of these tapes or DVD's,1004745600,,217,4.45
330733,5,6301480392,"The company that did this Sherlock Holmes series did a wonderful job with it. This is one of the more popular stories involving Holmes, and they adapted it very well. Listing to Jabez recount all the topics under the letter ""A"" that he copied out of the encyclopedia is very entertaining. Another nice thing about the episode was the appearance of Tim McInnerny (Percy/Darling from the classic Black Adder series or, for people not familiar with it, the bumbling henchman for Cruella DeVil from 102 Dalmations). This is the only role I have ever seen him do where he didn't play a total idiot. He should try doing it more often, because he did a wonderful job. The casting was well done, everyone looked the way that I pictured them in my head while I was reading the story. Wonderful!",1002844800,,785,4.614285714285714
330734,5,6301480392,"This is one of my absolute favortie videos because of both Jeremy Brett and John Castle. John Castle is, in my opinion, one of the best British actors from the time of Peter O'Toole and Anthony Hopkins, both of which he has costarred with. The only major movie he has ever done was ""The Lion in Winter"", so it was nice to see him again in something more recent. Another reason this video is so entertaining is because Jeremy Brett shows a side of Holmes that is not often seen. As mentioned by the other reviewers, the chemistry scene alone is worth the purchase of the video. It's quite interesting to see two grown men behaving like children, especially Holmes and Watson. One gets the feeling from other actors playing Sherlock Holmes that Holmes keeps Watson around because he is amused by Watson's lack of observing abilities. With Brett, he conveys an affection for Watson not often seen in other films, showing why he keeps Watson around and takes him with him on his cases. Absolutely delightful. If you do see this, try to check out ""The Lion in Winter"" also to see a significantly younger Castle (who plays Carruthers).",1002844800,,1129,4.65
330735,5,6301480392,"This is one of Granada's more lighthearted episodes.  The person below me went into the plot, so I won't bore you with it again.  There was a few scenes that jumped out at me.  One was, of course, seeing Sherlock Holmes flatten Woodley.  That was a GREAT scene.  The other was the very end.  ""Come Watson, let me explain!""  I listed the more humerous incidents for this review, but do not get me wrong.  There was definately more than that.  However, one doesn't think of Holmes having a chemistry accident or boxing someone down very often.  It really adds zest to the movie.  This is definately a must-see.",992908800,,608,4.537037037037037
330736,5,6301480392,"This is probably the best adaptation of Doyle's famous story ever.  I liked the story, but I never understood why it was so popular.  After seeing this video, however, the book leapt out at me.  Brett is now my most favorite actor ever.  He plays a wonderful Holmes.  He dons 2 disguises in this episode; the famous preacher role is positively spectacular!  You really get the feeling that Holmes got a kick out of playing the old clergyman.  At the end, his obvious disdain of the King is revealed by this disguised slight, ""Yes, she is definately not not on your level.""  The wit of this movie is only a foreshadowing of the rest of the series.  Only watch them if you are prepared to be hooked!",992908800,2,697,4.425196850393701
330737,5,6301480392,"Again, it has been done.  A movie has been faithfully transcribed to film, and yet nothing is lost.  Indeed, this is one of the best in the series.(I say that about all of them, but oh well.)  The movie opens to find Holmes in a tantrum because he thinks that he has been hit the rock bottom in his career.  However, Violet Hunter's intution is not wrong.  Something is definately afoot at the Copper Beeches.  The investigation hits its climax inside the turret of a mansion.  It is great to see Brett and Burke dashing around while being locked in small confines.  Holmes looks just like a caged animal.  Stop reading and buy this movie!",992908800,3,639,4.48695652173913
330777,5,6301480392,"As noteable as Jeremy Brett is composer Patrick Gowers.  While maintaining a sense of theme-related continuity throughout the entire series, the score for each film is very much an original, which he invariably gets exactly right every time!  I would like to know more about him.  A quick internet search hints at a prolific, gifted and eclectic composer.  I found choral, orchestral,guitar and organ music in recordings and performances. Somewhere I found the mention that Holmes' violin solo(s) are played by his (Gowers) daughter, Kathy;  and so the sense of a gifted amateur. Anyhow, can anyone tell us more about him?",991267200,2,622,5.118811881188119
330778,5,6301480392,"This is one of the first Granada Sherlock Holmes films and, in my opinion, it is one of the best. Not only does it, like all the Granada films, remain true to Conan Doyle's original story, but it arrests your mind, if only for one hour! Both Jeremy Brett and David Burke show their superb acting abilities and, since it was an early one some people think that Jeremy Brett was still awkward with his new role, he portrays the master detective like no other person could. He portrays him as a human.
This story, The Resident Patient, is one of the most interesting of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries because of it's many subtleties, seemingly unrelated clues and occurences, and, of course, Holmes's astonishing revelations. Your mind races to keep up with his! That is why this film, like all of the Granada films, deserves 5 stars.",991094400,,830,4.653061224489796
330779,5,6301480392,"Although it later declined into sentimentality and melodramatic excess,  Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes was a revelation back in  the '80s. This might be the best of his Granada series (tied with ""The  Speckled Band""). It's a solid, extremely well-acted version of the  first and maybe greatest Sherlock Holmes short story -- crisp, witty, and  entirely wonderful.",965520000,,382,5.517241379310345
330780,5,6301480392,"""The Resident President"" is one of my all-time favorites of this impeccable series, due to the complexity of the mystery, incredible performances by Brett and Nicholas Clay, and a wry sense of humor. Holmes  takes the case of a young, brilliant physician (played with amusing  haughtiness by Clay) whose benefactor and business partner has been  behaving in a most bizarre manner. After the ""resident patient""  is found dead of an apparent suicide, Holmes digs deeper to reveal a case  of cold, chilling revenge. The scene where Holmes silently pieces together  the circumstances of the murder is nothing short of sheer brilliance by the  late Jeremy Brett. I agree with the reviewer who applauded the producers'  decision to let the scene be filmed without dialogue and let the actors  act! This is perhaps the most memeorable scene in the entire series, and  that says a lot! Nicholas Clay's clueless-ness over the entire mystery is  quite amusing. ""The Resident Patient"" is simply a must for Holmes  fans and collectors of this series.",957225600,4,1038,5.041176470588235
330781,4,6301480392,"Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes is brilliant most notably because of his seemingly effortless success in giving depth to a difficult character such as Holmes. In this installment, (as well as well as ""The Dancing  Men,"") we see more of Holmes' difficult side: he barely hides the fact  that he does not like his client! Percy Phelps' weak constitution clearly  grates on Holmes, but as Phelps is an old school chum of Watson's, he  decides to help him anyway. The scene where Holmes leaves Phelps and his  strong-willed fiancee up in the air as to whether or not he will help them,  shows just how acerbic Holmes could be; even Watson is stunned by Holmes'  lack of tact. The acting is up to the stars' usual fine standards, but the  supporting players, most notably Phelps, leave a bit to be desired. Phelps'  character hams it up a bit much in his breakdown scenes, and he comes off a  wimp and not deserving of our sympathies. The character of his fiancee is  so tight and stuffy, one fails to see what even a milquetoast like Phelps  is doing with her. The production values are quite good, and on the whole,  this episode is recommended, most notably for Brett's intricate performance  as Holmes.",957225600,5,1204,4.644549763033176
330782,5,6301480392,"With the above phrase, eccentric Jephro Rucastle (Joss Ackland) hires unemployed governess (Violet Hunter) Natasha Richardson to care for his only son in his desolate manor house in rural England. However, Rucastle's  demands of Miss Hunter border on the bizarre, and she consults the great  detective Holmes to unravel the mystery of The Copper Beaches and why she  was really hired. This early Granada episode is nearly flawless. A crucial  element I admire so much about this series is the uniformly excellent  acting given by all players. Brett and Burke are their usual sublime  selves; Ackland is perfectly creepy as Rucastle; however, the clear  standout here is Natasha Richardson. Her film debut here is nothing short  of superb. Richardson is wholly believable as a strong, independent woman  nearly frightened to death by the harrowing circumstances she finds herself  in. The first exchange between her character and Holmes is a delight:  Holmes, indifferent and annoyed by her at first, is quickly swayed to her  cause by Richardson's sly and subtle play on his sympathies. Subsequently,  Richardson's scene where her character is frantically consulting Holmes  about the strange events is brilliant: Richardson's fright is almost  palpable, and the viewer immediately gains her sympathy. I must say I've  rarely ever seen such an impressive screen debut as hers. The fact that  Natasha Richardson is a stunningly beautiful woman doesn't hurt, either.  Highly recommended",957225600,10,1484,5.378260869565217
330783,5,6301480392,"Up until the advent of the Granada series, Brett was probably best known here in the US as Freddie in the movie version of ""My Fair  Lady"".
While I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Basil  Rathbone, and I liked Cushing's portrayal, Jeremy Brett has indeed created  a whole new brand of Holmes. Mesmerizing, barely contained boundless energy  and intensity, followed by moments of frustration, depression, bitterness  and apathy; that is the Brett Holmes. Even in the very few installments  that range far afield from the source material, Brett still carries the  day.
This installment is one of the very best. It forshadows the style  the show would use in later episodes, and the pattern of visual  storytelling is refreshing.
Without the fine perfomances, this style  could be a bit dull or long, but Brett and Company make the episode, and  the entire series, effortless and a joy to watch.
The attention to period  detail is a change of pace for those used to Rathbone. Everything is  masterfully crafted, props, clothes, sets, everything.
Also of note, the  episode does not shirk from the reality of Holmes' addiction, which is  excised from so many other Holmes efforts. It gives the episode one of the  most insightful and intense exchanges between Holmes and Watson, and is  true to Doyle's creations. A bit of the curtain is pulled aside on the  mystery of Holmes himself, and the inclusion of the scene does Granada much  credit.",946080000,,1448,4.836734693877551
330784,5,6301480392,Two thumbs up this episode gets!  This was one of the very few times that Sherlock Holmes gets out smarted...AND he's outsmarted by a woman.

I also hope your move to Adelaide went well, God bless you.  As to The Resident Patient:  What a  treasure it is to view anything done by people who love and respect the  project they are creating.  There is not a bad section in this mysterious  puzzle.  The high marks for cast, production values, script, period, and  faithfulness to story remain constant.  How often can it be said:  Jeremy  Brett is the one and only Sherlock Holmes!  His performance here is so  perfect (as it always is as Holmes) that it can bring tears of joy!  Nicholas Clay (who you might remember from the Agatha Christie film EVIL  UNDER THE SUN) does an excellent turn as the young physician and it is  always great fun to watch Mr. Holmes surpass the official police force  before their very eyes - this time, however, they are very impressed with  what he does.  Eerie, macabre, and truly satisfying, this entry into the  Grenada series is a standout.  Were it up to me, every home would be  required to view a Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes mystery weekly . . . and  this one as frequently as possible.",939600000,3,1205,4.493023255813953

Faithful to the story and period, it boasts a top-notch cast.  Let there be no mistake:  The late Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes.  Having seen and enjoyed Rathbone, Richardson, Cushing, Lee, John Wood, et.  al., those performances all wither against Brett's.  He has captured the  essense of the world's greatest amatuer consulting detective perfectly.  It  will be a long time (if ever) that his work will be surpassed.  ""Scandal"" is worth every cent to any lover of Holmes and  mysteries.  Just the physical change that Holmes (and Brett) creates  between his persona, the ""handyman"" and the vicar are staggering!

7811884,5,6301480392,"Plot in brief: Young woman (very pretty) accepts position as live-in music teacher to daughter of wealthy gentleman lately returned from South Africa, who claims acquaintance with her (the young woman's) uncle, whom he claims has died in penury.  He offers a three figure salary (twice the going market rate), making it impossible for her to refuse.  On her weekly trips to and from the station (she goes home to her mother at the weekend), she discovers she is followed on her bicycle by a dodgy looking man with dark glasses and a beard.  She goes to Holmes for help because the stalking frightens her.  Needless to say, not all is at it seems, but Holmes solves it.

The film chooses to focus on Holmes's skills as detective and athlete, and his interaction with Watson than on the potentially 'darker' elements of stalking and abduction - but that's fine, and in keeping with Doyle's story.  Noteworthy performance from Barbara Wilshere, who is *not* just a damsel in distress.  Highlights include:

- the fight in the pub, with Brett's withering, as much for the dialogue as for the the actual fight.
- Holmes being patched up by an exasperated, but long-suffering Watson.
- Holmes's withering assessment of Watson's failure - 'you really have done *remarkably badly*, Watson...'  And later, 'Did I really do remarkably badly?'  [Pause as Holmes thinks, then], '...Yes.'  Difficult not to laugh, but then one feels slightly guilty for doing so because Holmes is so brutal, and poor Watson (who really did try his best) is so obviously hurt.
- Chemical experiment gone wrong, when smoke billows out of the window, and a fire engine arrives, Holmes and Watson open the window, choking and spluttering, then Holmes says, 'Let me explain,' and drags Watson inside again.

Definitely one of the funnier episodes but full of insights about the Holmes-Watson relationship.  Brett's Holmes - an early portrayal - bears all the hallmarks of the later films: we see the genius and the lunatic, the impatience, the dedication, the sardonic humour that all but borders onto blatant rudeness, and the athleticism.  The only thing missing here is the black despondency Holmes sometimes falls prey to, but there's plenty of that elsewhere!",1278633600,2,2229,4.973045822102426

7811886,4,6301480392,"Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Red-Headed League"" is adaptly dramatized by John Hawkesworth.  Jeremy Brett plays the dramatic Sherlock Holmes and David Burke plays Watson.

Professor Moriarty is at his tricks again and has already been foiled three times by Holmes.  There is an ulterior motive for  trying to hire red headed men to perform nonsensical work and it has nothing to do with red hair or benefactors.  Why is the shop owner lured away by his assistant? What is lurking beneath the surface and how can the shop owner be made aware of his being duped?

It is all pure Holmes and Brett is brilliant in the part.  This is a pretty good rendition of the Doyle story and is fairly true to form.

Holmes smokes three pipes in 50 minutes to solve this case (in silence); it is a miracle with all of that smoke he did not asphyxiate himself or Watson who was sleeping in the room.

Pure entertainment.

This is 1984 vintage so do not expect to much in the way of filming; not bad for a made for television film.

This movie is based on the story ""The Red-headed League""  (1892) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

In this story, a mysterious newspaper ad calls for all redheaded men to join a league that will pay good money for rather easy work.  A newly hired assistant Vincent Spaulding (Tim McInnerny) brings this ad to his redheaded employer Jabez Wilson (contrary to the editorial review above, the actor who plays Wilson is Roger Hammond), who owns a pawn broking business.  Wilson applies for the position and gets hired.  His job is to copy out an encyclopedia starting with everything under ""A.""  To Wilson's surprise, a few months later, the league mysteriously dissolves.

Sherlock (Jeremy Brett) and Dr. Watson (David Burke) break out laughing when Wilson finishes his story.  However, Sherlock agrees to take on the case.

As Sherlock investigates, this case turns more serious and seems to involve his archenemy Professor Moriarty.

This movie is worth viewing just to see Sherlock and Watson crack up laughing.

Brett (as usual) does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Hammond as pawnbroker Jabez Wilson also gives a good comical performance.

Finally, the props, costumes, background music, and cinematography are quite well done.

In conclusion, this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it's based on!!

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches"" (1892) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

After an interesting beginning to this program where Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett) and Dr. Watson (David Burke) discuss interesting things (I liked the part about logic and deduction), Sherlock tells Watson he has received the following letter signed by a Violet Hunter (Natasha Richardson, her TV debut):

""I'm very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess.""

The person who has offered her this ""situation"" is oddball Jephro Rucastle (Joss Ackland) who lives at an ""extensive"" estate called ""The Copper Beeches"" (""near New Winchester [in] Hampshire"").  As well Rucastle offers Violet a lucrative salary.  However, there are some mysterious conditions that she must accept first:

(1) She has to cut her long hair ""quite short.""
(2) She has to wear an ""electric blue"" dress indoors in the mornings.
(3) She has to sit in a designated place with her back to a window.

Sherlock deduces that there is more here than Violet is being told and investigates.

This entire story is suspenseful and the ending is particularly good.

Brett (as usual) does a stellar job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  As well, Ackland as Violet's strange employer gives a superb performance.  Newcomer Richardson handles herself well in her performance as Violet.

Finally, the props, costumes, background music, and cinematography are well done.

7811889,5,6301480392,"When it comes to film renderings of Sherlock Holmes, there is absolutely no better than the English television company Granada's tasteful, historically accurate and wonderfully casted versions.
In the role of the detective himself, Jeremy Brett (who sadly passed away in the aftereffects of his manodepressiv illness, and barely managed to complete the last episodes) is THE most memorable Sherlock Holmes of all times, with his outbursts and brilliant face expressions. Sometimes he acts out like a madman, portraiting Holmes as quite an original character (but never disrespectful or exaggerated), sometimes working with very small means. Anyway, he never leaves you unaffected by his performance and practically steals the screen away from his fellow actors.
The series are also well known for their creative portrait of Dr Watson, played by either David Burke (as he is in this story) or by the more grumpy, but equally marvellous Edward Hardwicke -- miles from the gasping fool as he is usually portaited. But even the other roles are casted with pain-staking care and of course  brilliantly played. In this story, I will among others point out the very good performance of the lovely Barbara Wilshere as the pursued young, cycling woman and Michael Siberry's unforgettable portraying of the red-headed ruffian Woodley.
The environments -- the exteriors as well as the interior Victorian details -- have never been made better than in the Granada Sherlock Holmes series, and this puzzling and very thrilling episode is no exception from the rule. I think it is one of the best, although almost every one of them are of high quality. I have all of them and couldn't live without them.
