4850985,5,B005O70ZOK,"Every now and again a movie comes along that satisfies all the criteria, great story, great acting, cinematography and direction. The Devil's Double is that movie, based on the true story of Latif Yahia, the Iraqi Army Lieutenant forced to become the double for Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday Hussein it is a gripping, violent (although some of the stronger scenes are left to the imagination) emotional roller-coaster ride. Although not historically accurate and having read the book of the same name not 100% true to that either, it does bear enough resemblance to the original story to hold up, touted as ""a gangster movie set in the middle east"" it is indeed that, with scenes that stand alongside those in ""Goodfellas"" or ""Scarface"" it is definitely worth watching. It is out of the cinemas here in the US now, more's the pity but we can look forward to the DVD, having said that the movie certainly did not reach it's full cinematic potential here in the states and because of that when it is released on DVD a lot of people are going to think that it was a ""straight to DVD production"" which of course it wasn't. Well done to the production teams that brought this project together, a totally European ""Indie"" movie, it certainly looks ""Hollywood"". I've heard through the grapevine that there may be a push for an Oscar nomination for the lead, Dominic Cooper, it's well deserved, his dual role as both the victim Latif Yahia and the villain Uday Hussein are indeed the stuff of Oscar making dreams, his ability to swap between the two roles is for want of a better word brilliant, you are never, ever, left wondering who you are watching on the screen, unless of course that is the desired effect. I would recommend that you see it in the cinema because that is how it was shot, for cinema, but since we can't here anymore if you didn't get a chance to watch it the first time around, rent or better still buy the DVD you won't be sorry, it's a classic, a movie that will stand the test of time and will be enjoyed for many, many years to come.",1320796800,2,2054,4.524193548387097

4851019,3,B005O70ZOK,"Mr. Dominic Cooper acted well, but the whole storyline was an exercise in containing one's disgust. Latif, Udey's double, experienced an awakening of his conscience a little too late. At any rate, there is no guarantee that what we see and hear is not the double's self-serving side of things. Wikipedia makes no mention that it was Udey's double who shot him in the bazaar.  With Udey dead and a drastic change in regime, there is no one credible source to contradict Latif's view of reality 2 1/2 stars",1482537600,,504,4.662921348314606

4851022,5,B005O70ZOK,An amazing performance by Dominic Cooper in what is at times a very difficult film to watch due to the graphic and unflinching look at the violence dramatized in the movie.  A passing familiarity with Uday Hussain will alert you to what is in store in this movie and it can be harrowing to sit through.  I caution you to be aware of this aspect of an otherwise remarkable movie.,1481760000,,378,4.385714285714286

4851032,5,B005O70ZOK,"I'm not into watching news documentaries, let alone films based on Middle Eastern events. But, being a big fan of Dominic Cooper's work from ""Preacher"", I gave this one a shot. Quite honestly, the presentation of actions and words by Uday Hussein in this film were as disturbing and violent as those in the fictional, supernatural series Cooper leads. They were even more disturbing due to the fact that you couldn't assure yourself that they weren't real; you have to accept that such a psychotic and disturbed individual actually lived and helped rule an entire country. A powerful film, ""The Devil's Double"" made me open my eyes to the real terror Iranians experienced.",1478131200,,672,4.95575221238938

4851039,5,B005O70ZOK,"I rarely write reviews for movies, but if I do, it means it is special, in my book. I do like true life story movies and can tell if it has actually happened or if it's the director's ""hollywood spiciness"" of a particular seen. I believe this one to be true to form, just speculation, of course. If Oliver Stone's name was on it I would not even glanced at this film. Ever since he did The Doors movie I lost respect for him. Jim Morrison and The Doors was my band and I know a good bit about the band and the bad boy persona of JM. Stone went over board for dramatic effect and tickets sales. This story was told by Latif Yahia, the body double of Uday Saddam Hussein.",1474416000,,669,4.075757575757576

The movie is a glimpse into the life of a man whose complete lack of moral conscience and humanity allowed him to do anything he desired without fear of retribution. The double, however, is a man who is appalled at the atrocities he's forced to witness and takes a daring step to get some justice for the lives Saddam's son destroyed.

This movie has it all the greed, the power, the madness of a son of from royalty and what he did with that power.  Its moving it raw and it is a seductive movie that draws you in from the get go and never lets up.
Dominic is one of those actors who you may not remember his name at first but you remember his performances.  He has the looks and the ability and every role he takes he becomes the person he is playing and he does not fail here at all.  He brings a little humanity to Uday while making us despise and loathe him for his actions.  This is a good sleeper film that cannot go unseen.",1464307200,3,709,3.93006993006993

I highly recommend it!",1461024000,,247,4.444444444444445
4851126,4,B005O70ZOK,it has a lot of nudity and disgusting scenes. I had to close my eyes many times or forward the video. the scenes could've be avoided or decreased. Maybe the director wanted to show how disgusting Saddam family was.  The good thing about the movie that it shows how disgusting and psychopath the Arab leaders are. Poor Mideastern people. As Syrian it just reminded me of the horrible stories we lived and heard that it was done by the privileged families of the Syrian Authorities. Same Ba'ath party of Saddam and Assad.,1461024000,2,519,4.641304347826087

4851133,3,B005O70ZOK,"I gave this movie 3 stars with Reservations. The acting was superb; the sets, costumes and cinematography were Perfect. If you want to know what Iraq was like before the war, and take a step back in time, this movie Nails it. Also, unlike other reviewers, I don't doubt that Uday did some of the things portrayed in the movie. He is no different than any Spoiled celebrity who was never told ""No"" and had ""Yes Men"" around him at all times justifying or supporting even his most heinous and insane acts, except that no one would ever arrest him for the things he did. This is a universal character type natural to Humanity; Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely. So why with reservations?

The main character, Latif, strained the very bounds of credibility. He was handsome, honorable, a skilled and respected Soldier, a humanitarian, stoic, courageous, temperate in nature, Manly, loved his family, tries to save the Women, shoots the bad guys, everyone loved him Best, even Uday's favorite adviser AND Uday's Women. He was James Bond, Rambo, Maximus and Rocky All rolled into one! They even had to make TWO scenes stating that his ""manhood"" was bigger than Uday's (because one scene wasn't enough to get the point across). I didn't look into whether this movie was based on a book or a screenplay by the actual Latif, or just made from research and 1st hand accounts of the situation, but the whole movie plays like Latif Yahia's book of Look How Freaking Amazing _I_ am....which makes me wonder just how much of this is real, and how much is made-up as a personal ode to Latif's own narcissism.

Otherwise, very well made.

With all due respect, I'm sure this man's situation was terrible. But no one is Perfect.",1460592000,,1711,4.7157190635451505

I continued watching because, though depicting ghastly situations, it was tremendously well done. Dominic Cooper gives a performance deserving of an Oscar, not just a nomination. The atmosphere is electric and authentically reproduced. It is so genuine looking, one almost forgets it's a movie. Uday Hussein is the topic, Iraq before and after the gulf war is the backdrop. He is the hideous offspring of Saddam and a study of a psychopath in action, all the more chilling because he was a real person.
This is not for the easily disturbed and there are some horrific scenes of violence, but if just for the performance of Cooper, his dual role here, do see it. It is powerful movie-making.",1457827200,,771,4.804511278195489

4851366,3,B005O70ZOK,"Since his very fine portrayal of early English freedom fighter turned Prime Minister James Fox in [damned extraordinary] historic epic THE DUCHESS, I've been a Dominic Cooper loyalist. But, in the immortal utterance of Keanu Reeves: *WHOA!* Because here's an absolute double transformation that few actors ever accomplish...for starters.

Right here in THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE you're going to see the kind of gut punch, authentic surrealisme that Tarantino's films, even the greatest of them, have to undergo such visual and narrative distortion to achieve.

This is a most bizzarro indie film that one suspects was funded and conceived in a most nontraditional chain of events, and you have to wonder how it might have impacted Mr. Cooper's career arc. That said, Cooper's  great here, but you get the sense that it was his own talent, however imperfectly supported by the raw material, that makes this accidental horror film work in ways perhaps best described as ""despite itself"".

Sadaam and his terrible troika of excess --torture and genocide and stolen wealth-- were conceived, installed, and supported by The West in general and the US in particular ...until they weren't, as a nasty, strategic offset to the Saudis. Whenever election time rolls around, just remember, *all that* was architected and supported by, not just the Bush Dynasty of the Presidency, but by Bush senior's what, nearly 40-year control of CIA.

I can't imagine what it would've been like to survive under such a regime as Sadaam's, but the side benefit of this otherwise completely weird, inspired-by-true-events film is... that it probably does show a lot of that insane, terrible era. We watch in a couple cases, exactly what happens to transform otherwise highly educated and sane adults into monsters, corpses and shells of humanity. The  intervention in a young bride's wedding reception is a close focus of actual events that show how impossible living a normal life was under Sadaam.

Here in *our* now, the era of JE SUIS CHARLIE, where Western journalists are assassinated by Islamic fundamentalists, and international freedom of the press is threatened by religious extremists, I've personally come to feel that it's important to remember that Western support of torturing, insane despots like Sadaam is the fertilizer that enhances the rise of --or reversion to-- extreme evil of reactionary religious fundamentalism.",1428883200,,2404,5.261096605744125

Mr. Latif has been called a liar and a phony, but considering what he is saying, I tend to believe him.  He blames Western powers for the rise of terrorism, and this is obvious, to me at least.  Even with the inaccuracies, this is the type of move that is hard to stop watching.  It has some crude and perverted scenes, but this is what Uday was like.  He was a monster.

Consider why his books are so difficult to obtain.  He claims that they have been ""banned"" in the US and Ireland.  Even with the assaults on our Bill of Rights, I don't think our politicians are ready to place an outright ban on any publication.  They do however, use pressure to restrict the American peoples' access to information.

How Cooper didn't get an Oscar nomination for this performance is beyond me.

Dreadfully miscast here: Ludivine Sangier - known simply as 'The Body' in her native France, she deserves better than what she's been handed here. If you don't know her work, start with 'Swimming Pool,' which will leave you with no doubt as to the provenance of her nickname.

Although there was certainly plenty of incentive to lie at the time, for example the doctors who are said to have carried out the plastic surgery, I'm not sure why anyone would want to continue doing so today.

One thing is certain, howeverDominic Coopers portrayal of both characters is an impressive feat, considering the challenge he faced. He must create two distinctly different characters whose physical resemblance is almost exact while simultaneously striving to make the two indistinguishable from each other.

Too often when a single performer plays a double role, as we see in this film, it is difficult to become engaged and buy in to the charactors.  Not so in this case.  The acting was strong in both roles.  Each charactor was successful in illiciting a genuine emotional response.

Hats off to everyone involved in the making of this film (special props to the actor playing the lead).  Nice soundtrack, very sexy movie!

4851455,4,B005O70ZOK,"If even a tenth of the events portrayed in The Devil's Double (TDD) are true, then one can conclude that the world is a better place without Uday Hussein and his father Saddam in power in Iraq.

The focus of TDD is Saddam's hedonistic, amoral, sadistic, insane son Uday.  I could easily list several dozen other negative adjectives to describe Uday - in fact the film triggered me to refresh my memory on the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath.  Because Saddam ran Iraq with an iron fist and placed himself and his family far above the law and the people, Uday had carte blanche to indulge every whim that entered his warped mind.  It would be hard to pick the most horrific event from the many shown in the movie.

Besides reenacting Uday's many crimes against humanity and the people of Iraq, TDD attempts to delve into the physical and psychological means by which Uday and his father exercise their power over others and get them to tolerate and abet their criminal behavior.  The main subjects here are an Uday lookalike coerced into becoming a double of Uday, and Uday's primary mistress.  The film makers did merely an adequate job in this aspect; they did not make this viewer break out into a cold sweat, as would have been expected if they had succeeded in placing the viewer into the minds of the victims.

TDD is a star vehicle for Dominic Cooper, who portrays both Uday and Uday's double.  His Uday is especially good - a true unrestrained lunatic - and he provides a strong contrast in emotion when portraying Uday's double.  All the other roles in the movie are much smaller by comparison, including Ludivine Sagnier as Uday's primary mistress.  Sagnier turns in a fine performance in her English speaking role, but I have to admit that she is even more appealing when speaking French.

Watch TDD if you want to see what can happen when a country is run by a family of gangsters.",1356912000,,1907,4.609467455621302

4851458,4,B005O70ZOK,"I read a lot of reviews before watching this and read about the real life characters as well.  I expected an ""over the top"" movie with unnecessary gore and sensationalism.  I was very surprised that if anything it was just the opposite.  There were minor problems with accents and some other equally minor blemishes but overall the film was extremely well done and tasteful if such is thing is possible when trying to portray a psychotic dictator.  The film easily could have portrayed Uday in a 2 dimensional way but instead gives us a look at the totality of a person who was as broken as he was arrogant.  I don't know where the lines in this film are as far as what is fact or fiction but from what I have gleaned in my reading he may have been significantly worse than what was seen in the film.  Interesting study of what happens when unlimited power is given to a psychopath.

***UPDATE***  after doing more research it appears that there is far more fiction than fact in this film and that the real life double may never have been a double at all but has used this status as a way of making a name and a profit.",1352678400,3,1119,4.320574162679426
4851459,4,B005O70ZOK,"Dominic Cooper is not an actor who had ever made much of an impression on me.  I'd seen him in a few things (such as THE DUCHESS), but he wasn't really on my radar.  That has certainly changed after seeing him absolutely dominate THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE.  He plays dual roles as Uday Hussein, the unhinged, deeply dangerous son of Saddam Hussein, and Latif, the unlucky young man who happens to look almost exactly like the evil Uday.  Latif is forced to serve as Uday's double...the person who gets to go out in public pretending to be Uday and running the risk of assassination.

As such, Cooper gets to go wild & crazy as Uday...a man utterly ruled by his own perversions and volatility.  He has almost ultimate power in the Iraq depicted here...the years of the Iraq/Iran War, the first Gulf War and the years after.  There is little that is subtle about this depiction of Uday.  Unlike, for example, the depiction of Idi Amin in THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND...we don't really see any ""soft"" side or ""reasonable"" side to Uday...he's all uncontrolled id.  His drunken, coke-fueled parties and his forays into the streets of Baghdad in order to find young schoolgirls to force himself on show us a man who literally has no redeeming values.  Cooper chews into this with gusto.

But as Latif, he shows quiet strength.  Latif becomes more and more sickened by what he sees around him.  Uday, to Latif's chagrin, seems to have taken a liking for him and thus tries to drag him into his debauchery.  Latif resists, but cannot help but become an angry shell of his former self.  Cooper shows this character transition very believably.

THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE, as directed by Lee Tamahori, is not a subtle movie.  It is not really trying to make any global statements nor is it shrouded with a deeper meaning.  It's a straight-forward story of these two men, and some of the men and women in their circles.  It feels a bit exploitative...but is undeniably gripping.  There's something compelling about seeing just how low the human psyche can sink.  Tamahori directs with the kind of gusto Cooper brings to his Uday...over-the-top & a bit loud.  It's seems appropriate, but it also prevents the movie from being truly great.  (I'm not sure there is a GREAT movie to be found here...Uday is not a character full of internal conflict...he could easily be a villain in a bad spy movie.)  A few scenes of Uday's corruptness feel a bit repetitive, and for much of the movie, all Latif can do is endure.  There's little forward momentum, per se, but rather a series of set pieces.  A romance is developed between Latif and one of Uday's favorite women (played by French actress Ludivine Sagnier)...but it doesn't resonate too much.  Also, because this is a true story...the spot where the film ends is of necessity a bit anti-climactic.

Nonetheless, there is plenty to enjoy in Cooper's performance (and the most amazing ""split-screen"" work I've ever seen...I totally forgot that Cooper is having to act with himself in so many scenes).  This is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is luridly gripping.  If it sounds interesting to you, I would recommend it...but if it sounds like the subject matter is just a turn-off, I can't imagine you enjoying the film.  I give it a positive rating based on its energy and its star-making lead performance (or make that performances).",1352592000,2,3359,4.710120068610634

The subject matter has been questioned in some of the low reviews. Uday Saddam Hussein (and his psychotic pathology) is one of the reasons the USA became involved in Iraq. We were requested by scores of exiles to go in and remove the cancer that was the Hussein family.

This movie is not a documentary on Uday or anything else. It is a major thriller set in Iraq during the late 80's and early 90's. It is packed with excitement, insanity, brutality, loyalty and human drama. I give it 5 stars because I was VERY skeptical when I clicked on it. I had no idea what the movie was really about. But it moves fast and draws the viewer in successfully.

4851463,4,B005O70ZOK,"Lee Tamahori's The Devil's Double (2011) is docudrama based on the controversial claims of Latif Yahia, a former Iraqi soldier, who says that in the late 1980's he was forced to become a double for Uday Saddam Hussein, the oldest son of Saddam Hussein, the military dictator of Iraq.  With some remarkable insights into the despotic Hussein regime, the film presents a shocking image of a man, corrupted by power, often driven by lust, who employed violence and terror to satisfy his needs.  After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Uday Hussein was killed by American forces in 2003.  He was 38 years old.

Dominic Cooper gives an impressive performance in dual roles, as both Uday Hussein and Latif Yahia.  Because of his resemblance to Hussein, Yahia a former classmate is chosen to be a ""fedai"", or double for Hussein.  Yahia's job is to stand in for Hussein in dangerous situations.  He initially refuses, but to insure the safety of his family, he eventually agrees.

Referring to him as his ""brother"", Uday Hussein makes Yahia a part of his world, which includes alcohol, drugs, clubbing, parties, fast cars, and lots of women.  Yahia studies Hussein's mannerisms and speech patterns, and even receives the blessing of Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast) himself.  While impersonating Uday, Yahia is almost killed in an assassination attempt.

Known for abusing women, Hussein cruises the streets in a convertible, calling out to schoolgirls.  In one incident, a girl is abducted on the street, and taken to a party where an enraged Hussein butchers an army officer with a knife.  The girl is given drugs, and her corpse is later dumped in the desert.  In another instance, Hussein is attending a wedding at a hotel and takes a fancy to the bride.  He rapes the woman, who then commits suicide by diving off the balcony, her shattered body landing at the feet of her new husband.

With his family at risk, Yahia is trapped by circumstances, but as time goes on he becomes more resistant to Hussein's wishes.  After a suicide attempt, Latif escapes from Iraq with one of Uday's kept women (Ludivine Sagnier).  This defiance has terrible repercussions for Yahia, who decides to strike back decisively at his enemy.

Historically, Uday Hussein's reputation as a murderer, torturer, rapist, and abuser of human rights is well established.  While incorporating some factual events, albeit with embellishments for dramatic purposes, The Devil's Double is controversial, because there are some who dispute the claims that Uday Hussein ever employed a stand in.  While provocative and shocking, having such a key element in doubt, casts shadows of doubt over the film.

Led by Dominic Cooper's powerful dual portrayal, the acting performances are very strong, touching many nerves.  Definitely not a pleasant experience, or ""kid safe"", but still enlightening to some extent, for those with the stomach for it, The Devil's Double is worth seeing, particularly while it is available to Prime members.",1350172800,2,2984,5.0572597137014315

4851465,4,B005O70ZOK,"Body doubles have become part of modern history. Many prominent leaders have employed them, and it seems some secondary figures have done so as well.

Here's the scoop. Saddam Hussein's son Uday is a dirt bag. Drugs, alcohol, an insatiable appetite for women (even underage ones) and murder are all part of his day to day. He figures he needs a double to divert possible assassination attempts from himself. He hires an old buddy, tweeks his looks a bit, and it's off to the races. The problem is that the guy he hires is a genuinely decent guy so the going is rough.

This is a near great movie. Dominic Cooper plays both Uday and his double and does a really sweet job. Ludivine Sagnier plays one of Uday's reluctant girl toys who sees the goodness in his double and works to capitalize on it. I don't know how much they had to 'adjust' the original story for screen purposes, but I'm guessing the broad strokes are true. The whole thing comes to a rousing climax and gives the audience some much needed relief from an overwrought situation. The directing, music, editing and all the other aspects of production are all very professional. But what this has going for it at its core is a good script and great acting. There might have been too much use of the mirror motif but it's a minor quibble compared to the overall quality of the whole project.

I was a bit reluctant to view this. Not because I thought it wouldn't be good but because I wasn't certain the subject matter would appeal to me. That reluctance was swept away in a heartbeat. This is a good movie by any standard and I could recommend it to anyone.",1346284800,2,1619,4.462837837837838

4851467,5,B005O70ZOK,"It would have been terrible to miss this show by. I got a feeling that it's more of an European production and not slated for international cinema release. (I happen to catch it by chance as a the sample bundled for another DVD I was watching).

For those who had enjoyed watching The Dictator, this show was the real deal. While The Dictator was only catchy for the first 15-20 minutes of ""cool dictatorship"",  of this show was about that.

Basically, it's a show based on the real story of someone acting as the body double of Saddam's sadistic son Uday. In brief, being the body double had its risk of assassination and other form of stresses (mainly from Uday).

The person was also forced to totally erase off his identify, to be an effective double. How ""cool"" was that! But being a double has some perks. The double got to enjoy the luxuries (i.e. watches, cars) that Uday had and also some of the women. You got the drift. Towards the end, our body double paid terrible prices for being in a deal he did not choose nor want. But he would not be the only one :P

I would give the show a 5 out of 5 stars rating. Its not easy getting a real story like this, acted in a real way. Heck, probably we only got North Korean left for the good next story.

4851468,5,B005O70ZOK,"My review is based SOLELY on the acting skills of the movie. Dominic Cooper is freaking brilliant. I never doubted for one moment it wasn't two seperate individuals playing the role and that's because he's just that bad a$$ and good.

I'm not sure how much of the story line/events are true but based by some net research after watching this movie the real life body double did say the ""carving"" scene was real but a rose pruner was used and the ""wedding celebration"" scene was true involving the bride. I'm trying not to give too much away to anyone who hasn't seen it.

Based on news reports Uday's reputation as a sadistic, mentally challenged lunatic seems to be well founded and the premise of Iraqi citizens were definitely afraid of Uday coming into power. I'm trying to get my hands on Latif Yahia's book. Is it all true? Who knows apparently there is no one around to fact check the events in Yahia's book or is there?",1343347200,2,927,4.511904761904762
4851469,5,B005O70ZOK,"The Devil's Double is an amazing drama film starring Dominic Cooper. Surrounding the life of Uday Hussein and his double, Latif Yahia, The Devil's Double packs in drama, thrills, and even some dark humor. This is one amazing film!

What did I like? First, Dominic Cooper's performance as Uday/Latif is stunning: he plays a sinister Uday and an honorable Latif. His performance is one of the best I've seen in a long time and it definitely should've won awards. The rest of the acting was also great. The story was immersive and interesting. It's beautifully shot. I also enjoyed the music. It's brutal and powerful; this movie will stay with me for a while.

What did I dislike? I thought it had a very abrupt ending, it could've been a bit more fulfilling. That's only a minor issue, though. I also felt like if lost some of its steam towards the end, so the pacing was a little off; another very minor issues.

Overall, I highly recommend The Devil's Double. If you're still not sure, it's available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/15/12, but it's definitely worth a purchase. (the whole film is English, if you're wondering.)

The Devil's Double has strong violence and gore, including disturbing images of torture. It also has a graphic sex scene, and full male and female nudity.",1342310400,,1281,4.7309417040358746

1. Uday hussein never had a body double.
2. The guy who claimed to have been the body double didn't mention anything about it to his wife until 4 years after they were married.
3. No one has ever found any evidence that the body double's story was true.
However, if you ignore the main character of the movie and focus on the viscous accounts of what saddam's son did, those events are true.

The people of Iraq didn't bring down their leader so they also deserved his offspring. Much like here in America. We haven't taken power from our leader despite his ongoing efforts in turning our once great nation into a communist state. So along with Obama we get to endure the growing backside of his skanky wife while she continues to disdain the very country that the President maintains he has legal citizenship with. Gave her a job she wasn't qualified for and literally gave the President a job he clearly wasn't qualified for.
In short, our problems made my feelings for the actions of Saddams son unimportant and uninteresting.

4851477,4,B005O70ZOK,"The tale of Saddam Hussein's messed up eldest son, Uday, who forces a Captain Latif to be his body double through minor torture and threats early on. But then it gets really ugly as we see how bad Uday is as he grabs schoolgirls off the street for his pleasure, shoots nobodies who anger him and tortures anybody he pleases and typically without good reason. Of course, while all of this is happening you get to see some behind the scenes of the Hussein Family as well as the incoming First Gulf War. Of course, the real pleasure in watching this is Dominic Cooper. He plays both the psychotic Uday and the upright, moral Captain Latif. For that alone I would say this move is worth the price of admission. Some viewers will find this too violent and lurid, especially with some of the sexual scenes and brutal suggestions. The film was shot in Jordan and Malta. It was inspired by actual facts. The budget for this film was slightly over $18M but has only yielded a bit over $8M at the Box Office so far.

Brilliant script, excellent editing, photography & sound, great directing and very well acted by all other actors in the movie; HOWEVER, Dominic Cooper is an unforgettable revelation!!  And he plays BOTH lead characters with such conviction that I only learned of him having played both Latif AND Uday from the special features of the dvd!!

I put Dominic Cooper's performance up there with the 2 other greatest acting performances ever in my personal opinion: Charlize Theron in ""Monster"" & Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest"".  Charlize of course deservedly won all 3 major awards (Golden Globe, SAG & Oscar) for best actress, while Faye was snubbed by the Academy - apparently she was hated for her guts portraying the evil Crawford so well.  [According to Wikipedia: ""Dunaway garnered some critical acclaim for her astonishing physical metamorphosis and her portrayal of Crawford finishing a narrow second in the voting for the New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best Actress of the Year.....]""

It is equally mind-boggling that Dominic Cooper is not at the top of any/all lists in 2012's best actor performance category!  Who ever wins the lead actor Oscar statuette later this month, should heave a sigh of relief that he was not competing with Dominic Cooper for that trophy!!

As long as ""fun, light-hearted comedy"" is NOT your requirement in choosing a movie, you will NOT be disappointed with ""The Devil's Double"".  I have just ordered my own personal copy to add to my DVD collection.",1329609600,6,1539,5.031496062992126

But both are similar in the issue that people are in a prison and are at the mercy of a tyrant that is chaotic evil. The plot is to escape that hellish existance. This is a very dark movie but good does triumph over evil. In both movies the plots could have been executed differently to further demostrate the use of free will to escape the tyrant's prison.,1328832000,,517,4.17

4851483,2,B005O70ZOK,"Welcome to the most annoying laugh since Caligula. The writers of this movie seem to think that portraying one of the most ruthless personas of our era (Saddam's useless son) as a whiny annoying temper tantrum throwing idiot was a charming idea. Well, it isn't. It was a horrendous idea! Not to say he wasn't like that, but the lead actor in this movie did not pull it off worth squat. It was painful to view, in all honesty. And I've never seen so many so-called Iraqis played by white people. What the!? And I thought there was Muslims over there. Why in the world would the writers have so many of players in this movie refer to God. Again and again, God. Wouldn't Allah have been more appropriate. And the little romantic love triangle was trite and boring. Only reason I gave the 2nd star was because the woman in the movie was stunningly gorgeous and the war footage was the only dimension of this film with any feel of authenticity. This could have worked in more capable hands. But this was not enjoyable in the least. Some good gore though.",1327104000,2,1049,4.46875
4851484,5,B005O70ZOK,"This movie is great! It's about Saddam Hussein's perverted and twisted son Uday Hussein (and stated to be based on actual facts). It is a very disturbing, perverted and invoking, yet interesting movie that will really open your eyes to just how twisted this guy was and also gives a peek inside the mind of a terrorists mentality. It's almost comparable to an Iraqi version of Scarface, but in an extremely bad bad way. Uday Hussein actually makes Scarface look like a very nice guy in comparison. ;-) In fact, if the 2 were to meet in reality; Scareface would likely give this punk both barrels. ""SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!""

But seriously, if you like suspense, drama and thrillers and enjoy movies that are based on factual events then this is a must see. My wife and I rented the movie from Blockbuster and I ordered it the following week to add to our library. Very well written!",1327017600,2,890,4.5625
4851485,3,B005O70ZOK,"During the Iran-Iraq War, Latif Yahia (on whose memoirs the film is based) was summoned to the palace of Saddam Hussein, where Uday Hussein, elder son of the Iraq's president awaits him, assigning Latif, an army lieutenant with a striking resemblance with Uday, to do a job for him - a job that Latif knows he cannot refuse. He is to become a body double for sadistic Uday. This means not only danger and uncertainty; his new life also means long (and probably permanent) separation from his family waiting for him at home.

I do not know to what extent the film's content is based on truth, but the film's premise is certainly intriguing. Sadly, director Lee Tamahori, whose recent works include ""Next"" (just OK) and ""xXx: State of the Union"" (terrible), just doesn't know how to tell the story, which could have been more fascinating. Details of the atrocities committed by Uday are credible (and horrifying), but the story of Latif trying to maintain his sanity as ""The Devil's Double"" lacks substance and is told poorly, dependent on melodramatic twists and turns involving Sarrab (Ludivine Sagnier, wasted), Uday's girlfriend to whom Latif is romantically attracted.

Probably ""The Devil's Double"" will be remembered for the stunning performances of Dominic Cooper (""The History Boys"" and perhaps better known as Howard Stark of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") playing double role of Latif and Uday. Cooper's wonderful performances aside, however, the whole film seems a wasted opportunity to me.",1326585600,2,1507,5.097165991902834

4851487,4,B005O70ZOK,"This is a film from director Lee Tamahori (Mullholland Falls - Once Were Warriors) and is `based on true events'. These events surround the son of Saddam Hussein - Uday Hussein. When you are a bit of a tyrant or even just feckless and lazy, it is nice to have someone stand in for you on the odd occasion. That is where a `fiday' comes in handy, that is a double to be used to fill in on those boring diplomatic visits and be target practice for would be assassins.

In real life this was a former school mate of Uday's one Latif Yahia). Both Uday and Latif are played brilliantly by Dominic Cooper, who actually steals the show with two bravura performances. Latif is picked up and given a choice of becoming the fida or face the consequences. Well he soon finds out what refusal means and so against his will starts to do the bidding of Uday. The house of Saddam is portrayed as a hedonistic hell hole, where everything, life included, is cheap; especially when you have so much oil revenue. Being in absolute power also leads inevitably to absolute corruption. The actual events are shown and real footage is used in places especially around the invasion of Kuwait and subsequent battles.  There is also the recreation of some of the `parties' and the music is all `Dead or Alive' or Frankie Goes to Hollywood a nice juxtapoint to the on screen antics.

There are scenes of torture and some quite bloody and visceral violence as well as some unpleasant sexual scenes. This however is more a study of a psychotic child who only grew up long enough to learn to drive, fire a gun, have non consensual sex and be able to stick things up his nose rather than a gore fest. Uday is portrayed as a thoroughly unlikable chap with not one iota of a saving grace. There is also a fair smattering of profanity, but it is not gratuitous based on the events being depicted as anyone would be hard pushed not to let fly with the odd cuss word or two

This is not an enjoyable film, it is however a very good one. Whilst it is trying to tell a story that actually happened, it is still a form of entertainment and as such you just know that some poetic licence has been used; that aside it is still a powerful and gripping piece of cinema and is a show case for the abilities of Dominic Cooper. I hope to see more of him and further offering from Tamahori.",1325203200,8,2343,4.354691075514874
4851488,3,B005O70ZOK,"Uday Saddam Hussein was the sadistic son of Saddam Hussein, and of Saddam's two sons, the craziest. Uday decides that, like his father, he needs a body double to protect himself from those who'd like to kill him. Soldier and former classmate of Uday, Latif Yahia, is picked for the job. When Latif initially declines, it is made more than clear that the offer is not a request. It's a life or death choice.

Based in the true story of Latif, ""The Devil's Double"" is a tale of what unchecked wealth, greed and sexual averice can happen when the safety mechanisims are taken away. Uday had a taste for fast cars and young women, and he discarded them equally when he tired of them. Latif finds that even those close to Uday are wary and cautious of Saddam's son's appetites and savage behavior. The longer Latif remains ensnared by a man who announces at one point, ""God doesn't give me anything, I take what I want,"" the more he falls into desperation. Which means that if Uday wants to watch videos of the men he's tortured and killed (graphically included in the film), he will and everyone around him will uneasily tolerate it. Latif knows he could be part of the next random cruelty...and likely will, eventually.

The most amazing thing about ""The Devil's Double,"" aside from the bizarreness of the true story, is Dominic Cooper who plays Latif and Uday. Latif is troubled and fighting the person he's been forced to become, Uday is a raging id without conscious. Cooper digs into both roles with so much verve that it's tough to discern he is really playing both roles. Cooper heads up an international cast that includes Philip Quast in a surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of Saddam (and Saddam's double) and French actress Ludivine Sagnier as Sarrab, a troubled woman also caught between Uday and Latif.

Many of these regimes persist with familial authoritarian control backed by equally egregious military and quasi-enforcement agencies. This movie showed it all as well as one could expect. The violence, sex, drugs and excessive materialism were well portrayed as well as the central idea of despotic doubles as a protective measure. Factually, probably about 70% accurate. If the viewer is desiring a totally documentary experience they can conceptualize around those film embellishments. My main issue, which is minor because it pertains to finding an audience for the movie, is the title and cover. It is simplified misdirection to make the  movie's theme about showing the nature of our despotic beast as a money seeking devil. That doesn't help solve a problem that is much deeper and more complex.

4851492,5,B005O70ZOK,"I've gotta' be honest here.  I liked this movie before it even started!  The movie poster, alone, tells an amazing story beyond the often-misleading Hollywood blip we typically find in life-sized cardboard at the local multiplex.  Following suit with strong impressions, the film opens with actual stock footage of Saddam's grotesque war-mongering tyranny, and then transitions to a stunning Iraqi landscape with, arguably, the most beautifully crisp sunset I've seen in a movie.  The lighting is artistically harsh; deliberately over-yellowed and blaring...just like the grittiness of the story.

 There is little more story than the hook of the movie itself, and  I have to admit I didn't find it great, but somehow I was captivated!  Latif (Dominic Cooper; Captain America) is an Iraqi war hero with strong family values.  Uday (also played by Dominic Cooper) is a sociopath whose indulgences and small, impish laugh leave only suffering in his wake. Seeing Latif beside Uday, learning to emulate Uday, and coming to hate him while becoming all the more like him...very cool.

 The shots in this movie were crisp and made tactful motifing use of reflections in various manners.  The lighting, harsh yet beautiful, often yields indicative rays or glows hovering about our main characters as if to come just shy of haloing God's chosen of the House Saddam and their Godsend, Latif.  Amidst smart wardrobing and solid cinematography, the filmmakers have more tricks yet, catching me off guard with occasional scenes of brusque brutality alternatingly mitigated by oddly endearing scenes such as when Latif watches Saddam and his double enjoy a cool drink in between the games of their tennis match (against each other).

 The movie takes a telegraphed turn as Latif, forced and abused into his servitude all the while listening as it is called `love' and `honor', resists his ungrateful host.  Then things get ugly in this fictionalized account of the fall of Uday Hussein.",1323734400,,1973,5.176656151419558
4851493,3,B005O70ZOK,"This is the best film Tamahori has made since ONCE WE'RE WARRIORS and THE EDGE. The true premise of Saddam's son Uday in having a double look-a-like in case of sudden assassinations is a classic set-up for a rollercoaster ride of shocking violence and depravity. This film is an Iraqi SCARFACE and even uses the song RELAX on it's soundtrack which was used in De Palma's BODY DOUBLE. THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE is heavily influenced by SCARFACE but doesn't have the operatic epic quality of that seminal film. Nevertheless this is an extremely tough film that doesn't hold back it's punches. Dominic Cooper in the two central roles gives the performance of a lifetime. It's just as powerful as what Al Pacino did as Tony Montana. Unfortunately I can't see the Academy giving an Oscar nomination to this character! The film is photographed in seductive golden hues indicating the corrupt nature of what is basically a criminal family holding Iraq by the throat. It's fast cars, cocaine, sex, nightclubs, beatings, stabbings, torture, shootings of a country run by a psychopath and a psychopathic son corrupted by power and the oil wealth of a country!",1323734400,,1142,4.922279792746114

Based on factual events, The Devil's Double focuses on the same phenomenon as it applied to one of Hussein's sons, Uday Hussein. Dominic Cooper here plays dual roles as both Latif Yahia, the Iraqi lieutenant chosen as Uday's double, and Uday himself; as Latif discovers the depths of Uday's dark and psychotic behavior, he must come to terms with what he's been asked to do in Uday's name. I was fairly split about The Devil's Double, though I liked Cooper's dedication to the role. Directed by Lee Tamahori and co-starring Ludivine Sagnier, Philip Quast, and Latif Yahia himself in a supporting role, I balked at The Devil's Double's graphic portrayal of Uday Hussein's cruel and sadistic nature, but am willing to recognize the strength of Cooper's performance.",1323475200,2,927,4.948717948717949

4851496,4,B005O70ZOK,"In one of the features in the dvd, I was surprised to hear the director say he went for a fictionalized verson of Uday, yet continually referenced the real person in newsreels, in content, by calling him Uday Hussein in the movie and told of his demise in epilogue. However, at the end of the actual action, I was presented with a scene that appeared to be complete fiction. So, what I saw overall was a good film, but rather confusing in its point. Further the director said he wanted to dig to find out how Saddam Hussein and his wife created such evil as Uday and Qusay, the same idea which drew me to this film in the first place.  I kept waiting for some small revelation of how's and why's here, but found none.  Instead, Uday is presented as a rather one-dimensional, completely repulsive character, lacking any humanity or any redeeming qualities.  Perhaps he was truly like that, but he also likely had more facets than we see in this film.

Nevertheless, at the heart of the film is the relationship between Uday and his body double, both played absolutely brilliantly by Dominic Cooper.  The interviews with both Dominic Cooper and the real Latif in the extras were absolutely fascinating.

There is a lot of graphic violence and sadistic behavior, but I think the director did a great job of restraint in portraying examples of some of Uday's reprehensible acts. The viewer gets it without being abused by the images.

Ultimately, this will be one of those movies I have to watch a few times to mine all of what the storyteller is trying to tell me.  It's a good film, but at this point, I am just left wanting more...",1323216000,,1630,4.539249146757679

I don't want to give anything away but if you take the chance like I did you'll be glad you did! 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!,1323043200,,396,3.9012345679012346
4851499,4,B005O70ZOK,"Picked this up last night from redbox. I never knew a whole lot about Uday other than he was apparently super evil and even disliked by Saddam Husein even. Ouch. So I was really excited to watch this and it stays interesting the whole time. The story is told through the body double chosen/forced by Uday. The man's name is Latif. Despite focusing the story on Latif, Uday almost feels like the main character as well because you observe Uday's life through Latif. Dominic Cooper plays both characters and they do a great job making them look similar yet different at the same time. Mostly, Latif is always looking disgusted and upset by Udays actions while Uday is a loud mouth drunkard and all around sinophile. Nevertheless, they did a good job. Latif undergoes some minor surgery to look more like Uday which is why Latif was picked to begin with.

This movie has a lot of shocking moments. I wondered how much of it was true and what was added for drama. After some research, I found that most of the brutality sequences were true including the main ones. Some were the same story but possibly altered and I think some were altered but contained the main theme. The most surprising scene that was actually true except for the setting was a scene where Uday stabs and cuts open Saddams food taster in a public party. In real life, Uday used an electric carving knife, but in both mediums, Uday cut the mans stomach open.....In real life, they were honoring the wife of Hosni Mubarak at a party. The setting was unclear in the movie, but they demonstrate the viciousness clearly. Some characters were added that did't really make any sense, specifically the main female character. She's one of Udays lady friends who becomes attached to Latif. Her role is probably totally false, but I imagine she is there to further add insight into the insanity of Latif and add an unnecessary sex scene later on. I thought this cheapened the movie as well as a scene later when Uday ordered everyone to take off their clothes in a club, even the men. Why was this there? I'm guessing Uday could have done this. However, these moments kept the movie from being a five star rating. I found myself wanting to know more about Udays motives and how he got the way he was. How much power did Uday really have in the government? Why did Saddam give Uday so much free reign? What was their relationship? The real questions are never answered and some of the more interesting stories are never included. For example, in real life, Uday had lions and took many home videos of himself. He had a car collection of over a 100 cars. Uday also had the iraqi soccer team tortured when they lost and beaten. Some of these points are hinted at in the movie, but never developed. At the end, I felt like I wanted this to be a 3 hour special on history channel or national geographic rather than a hollywood movie with fake scenes added for dramatic effect. Its just surprising considering how much material they actually had to work with, that they did not make it as close to true as possible. Not to mention, the whole story may be entirely made up.

[...]

It appears that the real Latif has caused serious doubt among the press for years regarding his story. Apparently, he never mentioned his adventure to anyone until after he was married......Another reason why I wish this was a documentary. Hollywood never tries to find the real story.

Lastly, this movie is full of offensive material. Some of the worst for R rating. Expect a plethora of ""F"" words and ""C"" words, torture scenes, calling women foul names, and general obscenities.",1322956800,,3612,4.595348837209302
4851500,3,B005O70ZOK,"I rarely post reviews of movies but I though somebody should present an objective view of Devil's Double. Honestly, while it was a fairly entertaining film and Dominic Cooper's performance was noteworthy, the movie as a whole lacked substance and tried to overcompensate in gratuitous violence. While I'm not doubting the regime of Uday and his family was evil and forced virtually everybody to either placate to their desires or suffer the consequences, this was something we all knew before we watched the movie, and the film doesn't really do anything to dig into the dynamics of the family or the Iraqi dictatorship. It was also extremely predictable and the script left a great bit to be desired. As my rating indicates, I'm not saying this was a bad movie. However, for all the potential it could have and should have been better. Would I recommend watching it one time? Certainly. It is worth spending money on to own? Probably not for most people. See it once, there is little reward in a second viewing unless your looking for a lot of violence and cocaine and you don't own Scarface.",1322956800,2,1093,4.757894736842105

4851504,3,B005O70ZOK,"I had no idea what to expect from this film from just looking at the DVD cover. Dominic Cooper is dressed in gold with a gold background and his holding two rifles. Even his skin is gold. A bank heist movie? A gangster movie? I was surprised that THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE refers to Uday Hussein's body double in Iraq during the first gulf war.

It's a story of excess, brutality and evil. Latif Yahia looks amazingly similar to Uday Hussein and is the perfect body double after some minor cosmetic adjustment. Latif is an honest soldier unprepared for his new life as ""the devil's double."" He enters a world of excess and abuse and Uday's offers him access to his world. It's a violent and upsetting film to watch at times. Dominic Cooper is exceptionally remarkable playing the roles of Latif and Uday. A few times, I wondered if there were two actors but it was Cooper. This fine and talented actor has a great future ahead of him. THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE is worth watching if only to see Dominic Cooper. It can get confusing as to which man is Latif and which one is Uday. Cooper usually but not always gives Uday a shrill, high-pitched voice.

The big disappointment to me was finding out this movie ""based on a true story"" was mostly fictionalized. Yes, there is a real Latif Yahia who was Uday Hussein's body double. His book was the basis for the movie and he was an advisor. When I watched the extras, the director clearly stated he wanted to go with a fictionalized account of the true story. Uday's story was bizarre enough to keep the reality in. Oh, well.

Keep a look out for Dominic Cooper in the future. Here is one remarkably talented actor who shines.",1322438400,5,1657,4.4801324503311255
4851505,2,B005O70ZOK,"I really enjoyed this movie from the start. The plot was excellent, built around a classic suspense script turning an ordinary man into a good-guy Hollywood hero. Actually, not only a hero, but the real Bruce Willis clich type of a hero. The sad part, which none of the other reviwers seem to acknowledge, is that it's so painfully obvious not based on much truth. The story is just way too much Hollywood with probably no other sources than Yahias own. I would not bet any money whatsoever that even 10% of what happened on the screen is based on any real events. It didn't surprise me when I searched for Yahais story on the net and found that his account has been questioned by journalists from Guardian and BBC, and probably many others. This type of story just doesn't play out in real life.",1322438400,2,796,4.496551724137931

I will also say they did such an amazing job putting 1 actor as 2 people not once, (not once!) could I notice the effects. Great work on that. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.

4851514,5,B005O70ZOK,"THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE is a surprise film - a film that is not only informative in that it is based on a true story, but it is also an examination of the corruption of Saddam Hussein's (Philip Quast) control of Iraq, AND it also happens to display one of the finest acting performances by a male actor this year. Dominic Cooper is doubly exceptional playing both the man from whom the story was obtained - Latif Yahia - as well as the 'Black Devil' Uday Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein's despicably rotten, psychopathic, drug addicted, Lothario and brutal murderer oldest son.

There is a term 'fiday' which means body double. According to encyclopedic sources `Uday Saddam Hussein is known to have used a body double named Latif Yahia. Being from a well-off family, Yahia was sent to the best school in Iraq, and it was at one of those that he first crossed paths with Uday. Even then, his resemblance to Uday was something that was apparent as Yahia's classmates would point out. Years later, during the Iran-Iraq war, Yahia was a captain on the front when he was pulled out by Iraqi intelligence and forced to become Uday's fiday or body double via threats to his family. Yahia was then made to undergo training and cosmetic surgery (including dental) in order for him to resemble Uday more. After allegedly surviving 11 assassination attempts targeted at Uday, Yahia successfully fled Iraq in December 1991. Uday had his father picked up and poisoned in retribution. Yahia wrote a book detailing his life and the life he lived as Uday's body double in his book The Devil's Double.'

Baghdad, the playground for the rich and infamous, where anything can be bought - but for a price. This is Uday Saddam Hussein's world and with his depraved lust for debauchery and immorality, he helps himself to whatever turns him on. The film recreates Baghdad and the sordid conditions in the city as Iraq overtook Kuwait for its oil, and act that marked the beginning of the Iraqi war with the United States. Clips of Hussein and Bush are inserted for credibility. When Latif is forced by torture and threats to become Uday's double the tension mounts to an almost incredible level. When Latif can no longer stomach the barbarianism of Uday he flees with Uday's No. 1 mistress Sarrab (Ludivine Sangier) to Malta: Latif's protection of Sarrab is compromised and Latif returns, betrayed, to Baghdad to cause bodily harm to Uday.

The brilliance of this film is focused on the dual roles Dominic Cooper plays - Latif and Uday - two men as opposite from each other as could be imagined. But Cooper is able to pull this duplicity of roles off so well that it at all times seems like there are two actors playing the individual roles. It is a true tour de force of acting and should place Dominic Cooper in the lineup for the Oscars. It is not clear why this film is not better known. It is magnificently written (Latif Yahia and Michael Thomas), filmed (Sam McCurdy) and directed (Lee Tamahori) and in this reviewer's opinion deserves to be considered one of the best films of the year. It is that powerful: it is that deserving. Grady Harp, November 11",1321747200,61,3134,4.684210526315789

The film is highly realistic and very violent, not for kids or for the faint of heart.  This is truly a crafted film, a piece of art encompassing an incredible amount of creativity.

Not only is this the best film of 2011, it is the best film in years.  (a quick caveat--Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts I and II are also excellent films.)",1321488000,25,570,4.529411764705882
4851517,4,B005O70ZOK,"This is a movie about Uday Hussein (Dominic Cooper) and his double Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper). Latif is reluctant to act as Uday's double until he is made an offer he can't refuse. Saddam had body doubles so Uday must have one too. Unlike Saddam, Uday's body double is mostly a status symbol who he shows around. The movie highlights the things that Uday did, many to the embarrassment of Saddam. He would kidnap school girls, then when he was done with them, dump their bodies along side of the road. It showed us his drug use, extravagance, and ability to torture...never his good side, like he really knew how to throw a party. Oh wait. It did show that.  The movie also interjects actually footage from the era. We also get to hear the Iraqi take on the Kuwait invasion.

Good acting, but we knew the ending. It is my understanding Uday was really hated more than this movie portrayed.

F-bomb, C-word, full frontal nudity, sex, torture,",1321142400,4,943,4.601190476190476
4851518,5,B005O70ZOK,"""Uday has chosen you, you belong to him."" This is the true story of Latif Yahia (Cooper) and how he was hand picked by Uday Hussein (Cooper) to be his body double. Latif is stuck in the middle of becoming someone he hates and getting killed by saying no. This is another type of movie that will not get the audience that it deserves. Cooper, who plays a duel role, give quite possibly the year's best acting performance and is deserving of at least an Oscar nomination. Playing both the egotistical, sex-crazed, evil Uday and the poor, family oriented good guy Latif. The performance of the two polar opposites are so great that you sometimes forget it's the same person even when they are in the same scene. This is a very emotional movie, and even though you know how it will end you keep waiting for something bad to happen to Uday while pulling for Latif to be free. The acting all around is fantastic and the movie is a must see. This is a movie that is almost impossible to not have strong feelings of hatred toward Uday, and it brings back all the feelings you had while this reign was still in power. Overall, a great movie with great acting, especially an Oscar worthy performance by Dominic Cooper. Watch this. I give it an A+.
