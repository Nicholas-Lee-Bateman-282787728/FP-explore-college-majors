We own the video and cassette, as well as another book.  I have sent this video to several friends as gifts.  You won't be disappointed.  Be sure to sing along.  Your kid(s) will love it.",974246400,5,330,4.142857142857143
326546,5,6301248236,"We watch this several times a week with our 2-year-old son, and we're not deadly sick of it.
Provides the best of our two fave Raffi tapes, Baby Beluga and Singable Songs for the Very Young. I was afraid my son wouldn't  like *seeing* Raffi after hearing him for so long -- maybe he had a  different picture in his mind -- but he LOVES the video, and still loves  the tapes we play in the car.
You won't be tempted to hide this one, or  restrict repeat viewing. It's good for the kid, you can tell! They jump  around, participate, learn the songs, and have fun. He's already learning  to play guitar!
Also like Raffi in Concert with the Rise & Shine  Band, but it's not quite as good as this one.",956793600,42,696,4.18796992481203

The songs are easy to sing and it is great fun to watch the kids in the audience act out the songs.

She likes to watch the kids in the audience and the actions raffi does. He is truly a great performer! Some people gave it a negative review for ""grainy picture"" or ""old"".

This concert seems to almost magically hold the attention of the younger kids-- even babies and toddlers  My grand daughter started tuning in to this video at about six or so months old.  Now at closer to two, she still loves it.  When she is cranky for Grandpa, it is Raffi to the rescue.  Works like a charm.  Highly recommended for young children.",1403568000,3,464,4.325581395348837

Keep in mind the DVD is 9 years old, I have no idea how old the concert is, but it isn't a big shiny sensory overload event the way everything is today. It's Raffi on stage interacting with a room of maybe 200 kids and parents.

Before you buy, check him out on wikipedia, see what he is all about. This guy turned down big money and fame because he felt that kids shouldn't be watching this much TV at a young age. He does it for the right reasons and it's all about the kids.

It's a classic that most kids will love.",1394668800,,656,3.924812030075188

Our 16th month old can't say her own name but can sing half of Baby Beluga and her face lights up when she asks for this DVD and we play it.  When friends have kids I never bother to read their registry especially if they did not register on Amazon.... I buy this DVD, Happiest Baby on the Block DVD, Wheels on the Bus DVD (the one with Mango's Animal Adventure and Argon the Dragon voiced by The Who's Roger Daltry), and a few books kids books on Amazon..",1315353600,,583,4.132743362831858

If I could, I would say a million thanks to Raffi for bringing my children so much joy with his music!!",1308873600,,320,3.803030303030303

I was looking for music for my almost 2 year old son so when I came across a Raffi DVD, I was very excited; I loved Raffi!! However, when the DVD arrived, it was the exact concert we had on VHS growing up. It is a very nice concert and I love the songs, I was just expecting something newer not the concert from the 80s. However, it is a great concert and I expect that we will use it a lot over the coming years!",1299110400,,492,3.7864077669902914
326753,5,6301248236,My daycare kids love this DVD.  It is amazing that one simple guy with a guitar can capture the audience of bouncy little kids everywhere.  This is truly timeless and not annoying to older people. If you have a child under 5-this is a must.  So much better than Barney & the like.,1299024000,,280,4.245283018867925

326755,2,6301248236,"This DVD is definitely ""old school"".  Compared to other children's videos of today, it looks amateurish and low-budget.  The film is grainy, and it is definitely dated (see the clothing and glasses worn by the audience!).  We LOVE Raffi at our house, but my 2-yr-old daughter won't be bothered to watch this--I guess she finds it boring.  A lot of other reviews refer to it as a ""CD"" (listening to it in the car, etc.) and sound as if they are reviewing ""Singable Songs"" the CD, which IS great--no argument there.  THIS IS JUST A BORING VIDEO of an amazing singer.  It was a waste of money for us--I should have just used the money to buy another of his CDs.",1296345600,3,658,4.396694214876033

While we were both pregnant with our first last year, we were thinking of all the things we watched over and over as children and this came to mind.  We were both so excited to find the exact concert we watched on tape as a DVD.  My daughter is 7 months old now and has been entranced with Raffi since 3 months.  This is one of 3 videos that she will sit and watch over and over.  The songs are great and easy to remember.  I know that she will enjoy this video for years to come, just like my sister and I did.",1281312000,,562,3.9292035398230087
326770,5,6301248236,"I remember listening to Raffi when I was a lot younger. I really enjoyed his music. I enjoyed his singable songs collection and the corner grocery store albums. The first Raffi concert video that I ever owned was A Young children's concert with raffi. I absolutely loved the songs that he performed. After that the next raffi concert video that I ever owned was Raffi in concert with the rise and shine band. That was another good video. The final raffi concert video that I ever owned was Raffi live on broadway. that also was another great video. I enjoyed the combination of songs that were performed. I also enjoyed when he got the chance to sing with the Kids for saving earth singers. If I could choose between the three raffi concert videos to be my favorite I would choose a young children's concert with raffi and Raffi live on broadway. some of my favorite raffi songs were Swing low sweet chariot, Spider on the floor, Just like the sun, Somewhere in the world, water dance and like me and you. I recommend this artist to anyone who has never heard of him before. Children will love singing along to his songs.

Watching her clapping her hands, singing her own version of the songs, smiling every time she sees him on tv is a joy that only Raffi and his simple, clear approach could bring over and over. The entire DVD is a concert for children, with moms, dads and the happy faces of the young participants. I will certainly buy more of his other products.",1275436800,,528,4.557894736842106

Elijah, our son, was completely thrilled with Raffi and is totally addicted now.  Raffi is light-hearted and his songs are all so sweet.  It is so refreshing not having to worry about what my son is watching on TV, he chooses Raffi over any TV program.  We walk in the door and Eli will go straight to the TV and start pointing to where we keep the DVD and say ""affi"" ""affi"".

We watched it so much that I grew to love it too.  Now, I have a son of my own and I knew that the Raffi concert was something I wanted him to watch.  We started watching this when he was only 4 or 5 months old and now at 12 months, he is totally in love with the music.  He laughs, squeals, gets sleepy and is completely entertained.  Though it was made in the 80's, it is timeless!  I also love the other two concerts, but this one is the best.",1183420800,,580,3.823529411764706

I never mind sitting down to watch with my toddlers because I actually LIKE the songs, just as much as they do. We also listen to the CDs which helps them know the words. This was made in the 80s so the audience members have clothes that are a bit dated, but it matters not at all. Your kids will love him.

Raffi is gentle, silly, and upbeat in a way that young children seem to be able to really relate to.  It is fun to see the kids singing along and trying to do the motions to the songs.  And it is ""safe"" music that doesn't make me want to gag after I've heard it for the 30th day in a row.",1168819200,2,407,3.776470588235294

Raffi strikes a wonderful rapport with his young audience, both on-screen and off.  The songs are short, memorable, and very singable.  He is a warm and comfortable addition to our family whenever he visits via tv.  Especially memorable are the ""snuggle song"" Thanks A Lot, Baby Beluga, and his renditions of favorite nursery songs.",1026864000,5,570,4.785714285714286

So much more engaging for kids than the Rise and Shine band concert...Raffi totally connects with the kids in this one. I don't mind watching this video over and over (and we usually do). There are enough differences in the song lists that watching this video and immediately following it with the Rise and Shine Band video is not overkill...If you and your children like Raffi, BUY THIS!!!",1014595200,3,527,4.443298969072165

My kids, ages 3 years and 10 months, absolutely love Raffi and whenever this video is on (which is often), they are entranced by his gentle, engaging demeanor and catchy, easy to sing and dance to songs.  My 3 year old knows most of the songs by heart (even one partially in French!) and loves to touch Raffi on the screen to hug him.  My 10 month old bounces and tries to clap along with the songs, especially ""Shake My Sillies Out.""
