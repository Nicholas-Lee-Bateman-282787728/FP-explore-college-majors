1729051,4,B000068V9T,"These episodes range from some of the very best of the Outer Limits (Stitch in Time, Tribunal, Deja Vu) to the mediocre (Gettysburg, Time to Time) and the out-and-out bad (Patient Zero). Still, based on the superb quality of the three good ones (Tribunal in particular is a very intelligent treatment of time travel --  look carefully at the Nazis that take the old man's daughter away from him in the flashback sequence, for example)this is worth the money.",1062028800,,458,4.7974683544303796
1729052,3,B000068V9T,"Time travel is a very difficult topic to have a story about, mostly because of the holes one can place in time and space.  However, these in general were very good stories.
Easily, A Stitch in Time is the best episode.... and one of the best time travel stories I have experienced in a long time.  They do a very good job of exploring these holes that are created.  This is also the best Outer Limits episodes that I have seen so far.
Okay, I've got a soft spot when it comes to storied dealing with families.  I really enjoyed Tribunal.  Other than the fact that the main character would need to speak Yidish, English, and German fluently for this story to make sense... it really pulled at the ol' heart strings.
Gettysburg really turned me off.  Maybe I was surprised to see Prentice again.  Maybe it was because of what Prentice was trying to accomplish.  It seemed like there were a million different ways to change what he was trying to prevent from happening, and he chose the most complicated way to do it.
I said, ""What, Prentice again!!!"" when Time to Time came on.  The statement by Prenice's co-worker on what it takes to time travel would have been cute and funny if it didn't completely put a huge hole in the former two stories.  It reminded me a bit of the movie, ""Millennium.""
Deja Vu reminded me of a Star Trek episode where Data went through the same thing that Kevin Nealon did and also Groundhog Day (one of the best movies EVER!!!).  It was entertaining once, but I think it lacked the shock and awe that the writers were going for (none of their big surprises were big surprises).
And Patient Zero.  Okay, a big hole is building a time machine to go into the past and stop something from happening because at this time you lose the incentive to build the time machine in the first place and sending that person back.  So, the person shouldn't exist in the first place and the universe shoud blow up.  This episode was predictable all the way and left me very disappointed.
Overall, I really liked the first two episodes and Deja Vu.  The others I never really got in to.  I know that time travel is a difficult subject (I still haven't found the perfect one yet, but A Stitch in Time came VERY close), but the three episodes I didn't like forced me to dock the movie two stars.  Also, I would love it if the Outer Limits didn't do themes, but released it season by season.  I might have liked these all more if I hadn't watched one story after another.  I also have a feeling that they WILL release them season by season in the future and I'll regret these purchases.  Of course, I'll need a time machine or just have to wait to find out if I'm correct.",1056758400,13,2676,4.367676767676768
1729053,2,B000068V9T,I watched OL religiously on Showtime.  Towards the end of the series the episodes were broadcast in 16:9 HDTV.  I have not yet bought this DVD but I'm troubled that the format is 4:3 rather than 16:9.  I'm hoping that future OL DVD's will offer a 16:9 version.,1051488000,4,260,4.375
1729054,5,B000068V9T,"The time travel group of episodes of the new Outer Limits series is some of the best sci-fi I've seen. Its like the Twilight Zone but with often very deep, thoughtful and positive morality messages. The only flaw is that this DVD doesn't include all the time travel related episodes, in particular, its missing the first of the two Nazi concentration camp episodes. I agree with the others, I'd like to see full season DVDs come out. The two themed DVDs released so far are better than nothing, but far from optimal.",1046044800,,516,4.619565217391305
1729055,5,B000068V9T,"I found this series to be a real treat when it appeared on Showtime, and have enjoyed it for years for its tightly constructed and well-paced stories, often exploring more speculative ideas in 44 minutes than large screen movies do in two hours.  I couldn't disagree more with the review above, stating that it doesn't deserve the name Outer Limits.  Each episode starts with a very interesting supposition and explores it fully, often ending in an unexpected manner.

1729058,1,B000068V9T,"Somebody out there may think this is good sci-fi entertainment, but it sure ain't ""The Outer Limits"". The original series was as weird, wonderful, scary and dark as TV has ever been, and while suffering from low-budget special effects that by today's standards look admittedly pretty bad, it was still television's finest sci-fi moment. This dull, faceless, imagination-free series should never have been allowed to use the name, as it has absolutely NOTHING in common with the original series, and is simply a marketing ploy to glom onto the great name of the Limits. Folks, do yourself a favor, and think beyond the CGI special-effects that mesmerize you to the point that you overlook plot, story and character, and sit down with the newly-released original series DVD. Let the stories and the imagination of the writers, not the dated look of the effects, overwhelm and entertain you, as it has me for the last 35+ years. You might learn something about what real filmed entertainment should be.",1031270400,6,999,4.9880239520958085

1) A Stitch in Time - season 2 - Jamie Perrin of the FBI investigates the murder of 17 men that have been killed with the same gun over the last 50 years. The gun is traced to Dr. Theresa Givens who was 5 years old at the time of the 1st murder and to add to the mystery the gun had not yet been invented.
2) Tribunal - season 5 - At the Birkenau concentration camp Leon Zgierski watches Karl Rademacher shoot his wife and send his daughter to the gas chamber. A time traveler who grabs Radermacher's jacket sees the event.
3) Gettysburg - season 6 - Andy and Vince spend their weekends reacting battles from the Civil War. When their picture is taken with an old camera they find themselves on the eve of an 1863 battle.
4) Time to Time - season 7 - A daughter travels back in time to change her father's destiny.

1729103,5,B000068V9T,"Back in the 1960's, when I was a child, I battled with my siblings for control of the TV to watch the original Outer Limits.
The 90's version is actually as good or better, I am just older and more critical. There are two particular shows on this disk that are among the best of either series.
One of them has Amanda Plummer doing her best Shakespearean acting, giving a speech about the dangerous effects of time travel on the time traveler. The other has Saul Rubiniak as a time traveler delivering appropriate justice to an old Nazi.
Now what I want is the show from the old series with Donald Pleasance as the little man with the thing in his head, that causes mini-storms when he gets angry. I don't know if the new series repeated this story.",1382572800,2,748,4.388489208633094

1729106,3,B000068V9T,"""The Outer Limits: Time Travel & Infinity"" includes six episodes with one common lesson: Humans, no matter their era or level of technology, cannot disrupt the time stream without altering history in unexpected ways.

The collection opens with ""A Stitch in Time,"" where we meet Dr. Theresa Givens (Amanda Plummer), a frumpy, isolated university professor who has a single-minded mission: As soon as the state executes a serial killer in present time, she uses her portal to visit the past and exterminate the murderer before he can hurt his first victim. Although she is smart enough to build a time machine, Dr. Givens foolishly uses the same gun for each killing, which has brought her to the attention of the FBI with its comprehensive ballistics database. Investigating the murders of these men--killings which span 40 years--is Agent Jamie Pratt (Michelle Forbes). At first, Agent Pratt is everything Dr. Givens is not: smartly dressed, comfortable in the company of fellow human beings, engaged in the world. But a serial killer derailed Agent Pratt's life when he murdered her best friend, and when Pratt discovers that she can undo this atrocity with Dr. Given's device, her life and values (and even the set of her eyes and smoothness of her hair) change.

Plummer was an excellent choice for a mad scientist as few actors do red-eyed twitchy-crazy as well as she, and this role earned her a 1996 Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. In Agent Pratt, writer Steven Barnes gives us more than a suit with a gun as we learn the same bad choices Pratt makes about men--preferring the handsome alphas to the sensitive quiet guys--is the female behavior that initially set off the serial killer who later murders her best friend.

Three of the episodes in the collection include Nicholas Prentice (Alex Diakun), a visitor from 2059 with permission from the Chrononics Institute to meddle in the past. Slender and deliberate, Prentice resembles a lizard--one which moved too slowly to escape the uninvited kiss of a girl searching for her prince. Despite his superior vantage and technology, Prentice still has difficulty managing individuals and events during his temporal trespassing.

In ""Tribunal,"" for example, Prentice helps the son of a Holocaust survivor find justice for his father, whose first wife and daughter died at the hands of Birkenau's commandant, now a retired dry cleaner living without penalty in the US. When fetching artifacts from the 1940s fails to convince present-day prosecutors of the old man's true identity, Prentice and the son use time travel to relocate the senior Nazi--dressed in prisoner clothing--to his own camp; there, his younger self metes out punishment in a satisfying way.

""Gettysburg"" shows that destiny is a powerful force difficult to escape. In this episode, Prentice relocates a Civil War reenactor to 1863, hoping to teach the young man that war and Confederate values are not glamorous. Prentice has an ulterior motive: If this young man realigns his fundamental beliefs, then he won't grow old and bitter and shoot the first African-American President in 2013. The reenactor does not survive the trip through history, but Prentice's meddling puts other pieces in play that nevertheless cause the President's assassination.

In ""Time to Time,"" the Chrononics Institute snatches a grad student right before death. She can work for Prentice in 2059--a time traveler for hire--or return to 1989 and perish in the car wreck. To help her decide, one of Prentice's subordinates escorts her to 1969, where she learns that her anti-war hippie father died disarming--not detonating, as she believed--a bomb in the ROTC headquarters at Berkley. She must wrestle with preserving her own life, trying to save her father's life, and weighing the consequences to the time stream that her decisions will cause.

Weakest of the six stories is ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu."" This hackneyed episode chronicles a temporal loop spawned during the botched test of a transporter. The lead scientist realizes the problem and so each new cycle hatches plans to escape. The predictably malevolent military supervisor, whose intentions are to use the transporter for evil, suffers like Tantalus--the off switch to end the loop just out of reach.

The episode with the most moral tangles is ""Patient Zero."" A plague has ravaged the future; scientists hope to avoid the devastation by eliminating the woman who birthed the virus. The assassin from the future sent to kill her loses his ""killing glove"" and discovers he cannot perform a bare-handed murder of a woman with whom he strongly identifies (both are recently widowed). He must weigh the life of one against the millions of sick and dying who are to come if he doesn't act.

Since each episode of ""The Outer Limits"" has a new cast in a new place, the stories resemble plays with minimal sets. Those episodes that attempt to capture big historical events are at first noticeably small. In ""Gettysburg,"" for example, the audience cannot experience the magnitude of the 70,000 men who fought with General Lee as we get just a handful of well dressed extras (some affluent gentry, some greasy hillbillies) with a horse or two thrown in for realism. ""Tribunal"" is cramped as well; scenes at the Birkenau camp are gray, bleak, and muddy, but the prisoners are too fleshy and laundered to be anything but actors in roles. One tight shot after another--without the panoramic sweep of big-budget movies--contributes to the claustrophobia. But then the writers throw in such an effective line that the scene expands. The horror of the Holocaust becomes big and real when the commandant says to a prisoner, ""I don't like being here any more than you. But killing a Jew before breakfast is the only solace of this miserable job.""

As this collection shows, time travel is fun to consider, but we also learn that no human has the omniscience necessary to determine if the consequences to history will truly benefit or harm humankind.",1275350400,,6015,5.0605449041372355
1729107,5,B000068V9T,"#1 episode on my list of this collection was Tribunal. I felt the others were sort of hacknead, with the exception of the one about the woman time traveler wiping serial killers out of existence. Tribunal is something unique you will find in this collection, and it's something of a mixed bag. It is highly graphic in showing things the S.S. and their whole dispicable lot did which i found shocking and very descriptive of what an abominaton of human beings were allowed to do for so long. As I said, though, it is very graphic, and don't recommend it for people with PTSD. Though, shocking and graphic violance aside, I found the message very inspiring. The episode revolves around a present day man desperatly trying to recieve justice from atrocaties committed by a War Criminal, against his own family in World War II. He starts hitting bumps in the legal system in his efforts to get the case even to trial, and his sheer desperation and frustration really shows in this episode. Enter the time traveler, who, and i don't want to give to much away, has reasons of his own to help bring the War Criminal down. I will let slip that the time traveler's true identity is discovered by the main character, which helps reunite a daughter and father across 50 years of time, and agonizing pain that was only too real back then. I will say this, this episode is a true testament to how possible uses of time travel can not only bring long belated justice to the guilty, but a restoration of hope and healing to the innocent and victemized.

1729130,4,B000068V9T,"These stories are very entertaining, and actually have an intellectual content, in sharp contrast to much of the pablum that exists on television these days.  Some of these stories are truly excellent.

""A Stitch in Time"" is a superb episode that satisfactorily addresses the paradoxes inherent in time travel, and tells a compelling yarn to boot.  ""Patient Zero"" is a suspensful and touching story that also deals with the paradox of time travel.

""Gettysburg"" is a good story, but was too political for my taste.  ""Tribunal"" was simply excellent.

This collection is several cuts above what one normally finds on television, and successfully upholds the reputation of ""The Outer Limits"" both the original series and this new series, in that regards.

1729134,5,B000068V9T,"The Outer Limits is a smart show but what may suprise people who aren't familiar with this version is that many episodes are very profound, well-crafted dramas.

Six 44 minute episodes about time travel are presented here from the series.

  I know many fans want to see this series released like other series are: a whole season in a set.  But I have to say I kind of like this format.  I cringe at spending between fifty and a hundred dollars on a whole season of a t.v. show.  Anyway, because this is an anthology series there's no harm in breaking it up.  Each episode you're meant to visit someplace new.  That's the appeal of the Outer Limits.

  Being inexpensive isn't enough to recommend something though.  It has to be good.  And this is definately top-notch sci-fi drama.

  Time travel is a great idea (hats off to H.G. Wells for inventing it).  Isn't it interesting that in time travel stories characters run into the hand of fate again and again?  I think that's part of their appeal.  That and the idea of revisiting the past, places and times from before you were born, using knowledge to steer things your way, and all that.  Like one of the producers says on this disc, it's a kind of wish fulfillment.

  Some of the episodes here actually do have a recurring character.  Apparently the Limits producers were trying to create a spin-off time travel series.  The three episodes with that character work as stand alone stories too, but they set up an intriguing idea of these time meddlers opperating on the events of the past.  I like the fact that they allow their sympathies to interfere in their choices more than you would see in other sci-fi shows (who would put rules ahead of personal sympathy).  They DO need to get approval for their meddling and they do want to preserve the time line, but sometimes they act impulsively too.  I mean, they ARE meddlers by definition.

  Serious topics like the nazi holocaust, crime and punishment, the power of our choices and where they lead, and self-sacrifice to save others in the future are fully realized in these stories.  (The holocaust isn't used lightly for that episode.  It's serious drama and is done very well, as most of these episodes are.)

  Most of these episodes are like mini-movies.  The production values are as impressive as the writing.  From the recreations of civil war battles, to the gritty concentration camp, to the cool effects shot of one time traveler embracing another and vanishing as a fire ball nearly envelopes them, the special effects are there to back up the great acting and storytelling.

  In fact, I probably haven't said enough about the acting.  It's very good throughout.  Stories like these depend on us buying the characters as much as the effects and writing and they have a shorter time to make an impact than a regular series actor has.

  Bottom line:  The Outer Limits - Time Travel and Infinity is well worth the price.  You may even watch it more than big sci-fi movies about time travel like the Terminator or Back to the Future.",1120176000,4,3051,4.655367231638418
1729135,5,B000068V9T,"After reading some peoples stupid reviews about this disc, I decided to travel back in time and write this.

The new Outer Limits were MUCH better than the original (a rare exception for me where I think the original series was not as good)

Tribunal- (A+) Hands Down the best Episode on the dvd!! Amazingly well written, emotional, great acting, etc.

Gettysburg (A-) I'm shocked some reviews didn't like this. This was incredible and had a great twist as to why they were sent off to battle. A Great Story!

Time To Time (B+) This was also very good and wrapped up the ""Prentice"" character and was a good conclusion to the previous 2 episodes mentioned above. They actually made this episode in hopes of making a pilot for a spinoff with the ""Prentice"" character.  If only they did, that would've made one of the best shows ever!!

A Stitch In Time (B+) A very well written story and thought provoking.  Emotional too.

Patient Zero (C+) Cool Story, Michael Rooker was great and was a good story of time travel, sacrifice, etc.

Deja Vu (C+) Kevin Nealon was very good, reminded me of Groundhog Day, there was also an X-Files episode that was similar as well.

My work is done here and it's time for me to travel back to where I came from.",1108166400,5,1241,4.5
1729136,5,B000068V9T,"Because of its complex plots and fantastic plot twists, not to mention that most episodes are family appropriate, the Outer Limits shines as an example of great television.  However, like most great TV shows these days, I've only ever seen it on a non-network channel, which means it will never get the publicity it deserves (unlike annoying shows like Sinefeld and Friends).

The show is a lot like the Twilight Zone from back in the sixties (when the original 'Outer Limits' originally ran), but with more bizare plot twists and, more often than not, a great moral at the end.  This DVD is not a collection of all episodes from a particular season, but is instead a set of episodes related by the fact that they all deal with time travel (although there was one season in which time travel was featured quite prominently, although I'm not sure which it was).

The highlights of this set would have to be Patient Zero and Time to Time (I haven't watched Deja vu yet, so I can't comment on it).  Patient Zero is somewhat predictable, although watching the pieces fall into place is almost as entertaining as not knowing what will happen.  Time to Time is probably my favorite episode of the show, and features some great cinamatography and a perfect ending, although I found it somewhat predictable.  As I sat and saw the pieces fall into place, I smiled with a sort of evil glee to see where the story was going.

The only episode I didn't really care for was the Gettygsburg episode, because it didn't really have a great plot twist, interesting characters, or even that great of a plot.

If you're a fan of the show, or just interested in stories with involving plots and great twists, this set will not disapoint.",1095206400,6,1717,4.621710526315789
1729137,4,B000068V9T,"The SHOWTIMES cable channel has brought back the 1950s science fiction series THE OUTER LIMITS.  In it the series has updated technology & special effects as well as theme-lines to match the late 20th century.
SHOWTIME has begun to release some of the ""best-of"" on DVD via general motif.  Each DVD has 4 episodes.  The previous installment was called SEX AND SCIENCE fiction & the stories were a nice blend of eroticism & Sci-fi.
The current DVD contains 4 episodes centered around the concept of time travel.  Of the 4, the 2nd story [THE TRIAL] is by far & away the most poignant.  It details a story about a Jewish concentration camp and is vividly moving.  The 2nd story alone is worth the price of the DVD.
3 of the 4 stories are about a time-traveller from the future (including THE TRIAL).  Of all 4 episodes, the fourth is the weakest.  They layer on some elements from the 2nd and 3rd stories and it all comes across as being very ad-hoc.
If time travel is an interest of yours, here is a DVD with some fresh approaches to the topic.  If you prefer erotic science fiction, I would recommend the 1st OUTER LIMITS compilation of stories.  If (like me!) you are an avid sci-fi fan across-the-board, I would think both DVDs should be in your collection.",1080432000,5,1258,4.5265486725663715
7964882,5,B000068V9T,"This ""Outer Limits"" dvd is one of my all-time favorite dvd's in my collection!  ""A Stitch in Time"" is an episode I remember, to this day, seeing air for the first time on television in the 90s and it's NEVER left my brain.  One of the best performances of any kind from Amanda Plummer!  ""Gettysburg"" has Meat Loaf in an impressive performance and a young (post ""Blair Witch Project"") Joshua Leonard, in fantastic performances! And ""Tribunal"" is one of the best screenplays ever written.  Growing up in Germany for much of my youth, the topic hit really close to home. I cherish this dvd set, and I can only hope it's somehow re-released on High Definition sometime down the line.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1518307200,,702,4.721311475409836

The best one is the story about the civil war enactors from our time going back to the past and to the actual civil war. Puts it in perspective!
