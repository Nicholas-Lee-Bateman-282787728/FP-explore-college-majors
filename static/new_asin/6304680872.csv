908026,5,6304680872,I can remember at age 9 sitting home in my living room all alone watching this movie.  It caught my eye because of the racial issues involved.  The disapperance of a black child caused a huge uproar in a small town.  She was last seen talking to a white man who was later accused of kidnapping her.  The turn of events are really interesting.  I purchased this movie last year and watched it again for the second time.  This is a very captivating classic.  I am glad I was able to add it to my video collection.,978912000,14,511,4.206185567010309
908027,5,6304680872,"A Black child slowly walks across a field picking flowers. As she appears in full view, she seems to drop off the bottom of the screen. The camera now move up and focuses down on a small well that she has fallen into.  Dimitri Tiompkin's music profoundly enhances this scene and the rest of the  movie. When she is reported missing, the police determine that the last  person to see her was a white man (the actor is Henry Morgan, later known  as Harry Morgan from Dragnet and MASH). The scenes of racial turmoil,  interspersed with the scene of the field where the girl fell into the well,  produce a feeling of disquieting intensity in the viewer. Even 40 after  seeing The Well for the first time, I still get chills watching it.",914457600,14,732,4.458646616541353
908281,5,6304680872,"This was a great movie about a little girl who falls down a well and how at first both sides allow their own racial prejudices to tear the town apart until they realize that only by working together can they save the little girl. The movie was made in 1951 and starred Richard Rober Christine Larson Barry Kelley and Harry Morgan(of MASH Fame)as the prime suspect since he was the last one seen with her .And also in the great cast were actors whos faces are known but not their names and in particular Maidie Norman as the girls mother did an excellent job .as did Robert Osterloch,Tom Powers,Lane Chandler,Michael Ross and Gwendolyn Lane as the littlegirl all were excellent. I reccommend this classic story for everyone to see.",1327795200,,730,4.666666666666667
908282,5,6304680872,This movie is not only entertaining but very enjoying as well..the story line is well thought out and follows the script from beginning to end..The Well is a Hollywood classic I watched when I was a child.  I purchsed this movie as one to share with my family and friends.  The well is one movie in my opinion to be one of the best of the rest.,1304467200,,344,4.119402985074627
908283,5,6304680872,"I saw this film several times back in the '70s and am glad someone finally released it on DVD.  I found this film striking for its depiction of race relations and human nature in a small town that, on the surface seemed to quite peaceful.  Racism is acknowledged, but never pandered to.

When a little black girl goes missing after falling into an abandoned well nobody knows exists, the town flares up in panic.  After attacking a stranger in town on the flimsiest of circumstancial evidence, the townsfolk fall into spreading rumors, pointing fingers, casting blame, and making false accusations.

Misunderstandings and outright lies pile up like a slow-motion freeway accident, and the whole town starts to slide slowly but surely to a full-fledged race war.  Meanwhile, the little girl is still missing.

Low-budget as this film may be, it's still captivating even in this day and age.",1295654400,,889,4.966216216216216
908284,4,6304680872,"""The Well"" (1951) is an intriguing melodrama about race relations.  When a young black girl goes missing in a small town, suspicion falls on a white newcomer played by Harry Morgan (Colonel Potter on ""M*A*S*H"").  The man is arrested and the town members react by viciously lashing out against each other.  The local Sheriff (Richard Rober) struggles to make peace without exacerbating the strained race relations in the town.

The movie is generally well done and zips along quickly, although much of the action takes place in a series of montages.  For a 1950s movies, the movie is surprisingly trenchant with some rather course language reflective of its time.  The script by Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse was nominated for an Academy Award as well as the Writers Guild of America Award.  In addition, the score by legendary composer Dimitri Tiomkin scored a nomination from the Golden Globes.  I usually love Tiomkin's scores, especially ""High Noon"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" but his work on ""The Well"" is rather heavy-handed.

Unfortunately, the movie apparently has entered the public domain, and no care seems to have gone into this DVD release - the transfer is somewhat poor and scratchy and there are no subtitles and no extras.  However, for what is essentially a b-movie, ""The Well"" is quite good.  Incidentally, the DVD cover seems to be selling the movie as a crime noir and is totally misleading.",1246060800,,1413,4.944915254237288
908285,5,6304680872,"I nominated this film for the National Film Registry.

Though 'Birth of a Nation' and 'Gone With the Wind' are probably considered the most well-known race depiction films, 'The Well' should be better known as it is just as informative as these older classics.

Other viewers failed to note that despite the wooden acting, one of the films finest attributes is its unsparing view of human nature: depicting human viciousness expressed principally through mob violence and rumormongering (e.g., to get her boyfriend's attention a coquette lies about victimization by a Black man, not caring that the lie fuels a race riot).

I had not seen this film since the 1970s.  I believe the local networks stopped showing it because whites in the film frequently use the 'n' word, which, even in the 21st-century is shocking in film.

As an aside, the film is timely because it throws a strong historical light on race relations, a key topic in this '08 election season.",1200614400,2,960,4.901234567901234
908286,5,6304680872,"I saw The Well in the theater in 1951 and never forgot it, especially the film score by Dimitri Tiomkin.  Both are memorable and should be seen and heard.",1191024000,,154,4.310344827586207
908287,4,6304680872,"All of the previous reviews here were based on the VHS release of this movie, so I'll offer a few comments regarding the DVD.  First off, the cover photo on the Image Entertainment release has absolutely NOTHING to do with what happens in the film.  It's a publicity shot of the actors designed to catch your attention, but it gives the suggestion that the story is some sort of romantic melodrama, which this movie definitely is NOT.

As for the picture and sound quality of the DVD, the film obviously has not undergone any restoration.  There are multiple scratches (resulting in vertical white lines) running through a good portion of the movie, and quite a few specks and splotches as well.  Nonetheless, the overall picture quality is quite acceptable; in fact, the defects in the film almost enhance the vintage feel of the story.

The comments by other viewers are mostly accurate. Yes, the acting and dialogue do occasionally show the marks of a low-budget production.  However, there's a certain emotional undercurrent and sense of urgency in this movie that really makes for some tense viewing.  All in all it's a riveting film and quite ahead of its time in its exploration of race relations.

I disagree with the person who stated that THE WELL is good for only a single viewing.  In my opinion this is an extraordinary little film that not only holds up as a thought-provoking drama but remains important to see as a notable part of motion picture history.  It belongs in anyone's collection of classic movies.",1189987200,5,1524,4.800766283524904
908288,4,6304680872,"This is a pretty fascinating little film. The other reviewers have pretty much told the story , so I won't be repetitive on that.
But what is really interesting is the portrayal of the Black characters. The film aviods rank stereotypes of the time and most of the Black characters are shown as decent, intellligent, and well-spoken (aside from the thuggish rioters, who are not the main characters). Similarly, it's also good that the film makes differences between the wild White rioters and the decent White characters who try to stop the madness. Overall, a very anti-racist film for it's time that deserves to be better known. Yeah, some of the dialogue and actiong are corny by modern standards, but it's still a good film that is really more about good vs. evil than Black vs, White.",1033171200,6,789,4.766423357664234

UPON REWATCHING"" THE WELL"" I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED HOW DATED IT WAS.
THE CHARACTERS USE EXCESSIVE FACIAL EXPRESSION AND ESSENTIALLY OVER ACT TO DRIVE HOME DRAMATIC POINTS. UNFORTUNATELY REAL PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T ACT THAT WAY.
THE PLOT CENTERS ON HOW AN AVERAGE TOWN DESCENDS INTO MOB VIOLENCE WHEN A BLACK GIRL, LAST SEEN WITH A WHITE MAN, DISAPPEARS.THE IMMEDIATE ASSUMPTION IS THAT HE'S MURDERED HER, WHEN IN FACT SHE'S FALLEN INTO AN ABANDONED WELL. THE TOWNSFOLK

908290,5,6304680872,I saw this movie for the first time 30 years ago.  It was excellent.  I have seen it many times since then. It sends you through a range of feelings from anger to absolute joy. It is a study of human emotions.  I highly recommend the film.  I guarantee you will enjoy it.,1004054400,10,271,4.056603773584905
7875551,5,6304680872,"I remember seeing this movie when I was in grade school in the early 60's. It was way ahead of its time, considering it's subject matter because it was the proverbial pervasive elephant in the ""room"": I had hoped to purchase it, but the prices listed, even for this truly thought provoking film, tells me that someone must be hitting the pipe pretty hard. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
Too bad. I'm choosing to go on with appreciating my memories of the film, and hoping that TCM will eventually get around to showing it.. then I'll have it available for viewing as often as I like on the DVR.

7875555,5,6304680872,I remember watching this movie as a child.  It was really good to watch. A real movie opposed to today.,1393891200,,103,4.15
7875556,5,6304680872,"Set in a small Midwestern town, this is the true story of a black child who has disappeared -- setting off race riots when a white man is suspected.

Cast includes Richard Rober, Henry (Harry) Morgan, Barry Kelly and Gwendolyn Laster as the missing child. My old Milwaukee neighbor -- noted black character actor George Hamilton -- plays her grandfather.,

""The Well"" -- one of several powerful race relations movies of the 1930s and '40s -- was preceded in 1934 by the original version of ""Imitation of Life,"" along with 1949's ""Pinky,"" ""Home of the Brave"" and ""Lost Boundaries"" and 1950's ""No Way Out."" All sent a powerful message prior to the 1960s Civil Rights Movment.",1393200000,,673,4.793103448275862
7875557,5,6304680872,"GREAT little film from the early fifties that is not as well known as it deserves to be.  A little black girl, unknown to everyone, falls down a well.  A white man is mistakenly suspected of kidnapping or doing away with her.  Racial incidents from both sides start consuming the town with factions, also from both sides, trying to calm things down.  The child is eventually discovered in the well and the entire town pulls together to rescue her with the accused, embittered man being the only one able to do the job.  I felt the whites were not nearly as repentant as they should have been for their behavior, but this was the 50's.  One can expect a lot, but you won't get much.  The DVD transfer is good, the cover has actors from the film but their stance has nothing to do with what is going on in the picture.  Again, GREAT film.  HIGHLY recommended.",1390867200,,857,4.407643312101911
7875558,3,6304680872,"Not surprisingly, the print used for the dvd was a really bad one, which is probably the quality of any film this old, in public domain, and not from a film vault or personal collection.  Very good movie, a little over the top in places, with dvd cover art that exists only in someone's mind, perhaps deceptively used for the film's original release but well beyond being needed today.",1379808000,,385,4.579710144927536
7875559,5,6304680872,"This movie is not a love story between a man and a woman.  The Well is a study in sociology, race relations, and human nature.  Released in the 1950's, it is not outdated.
