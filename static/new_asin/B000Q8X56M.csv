8195239,5,B000Q8X56M,"As the producer of this documentary, which went on to win an Emmy Award, I find it curious that Dennis Conner and John Bertrand were listed on this site's description of the film. Apart from interviews and audio clips, Conner and Bertrand had nothing to do with producing it. Perhaps Amazon could list the film's brilliant director; Bud Brown, it's exceptional writer, Barbara Lloyd as well as the host of others who helped make it one of sailing's best documentaries to date.
