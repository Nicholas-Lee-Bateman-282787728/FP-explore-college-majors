7900819,5,8024738988,"From Jiri Menzel, New Wave Czech filmmaker most famous for 'Closely Watched Trains', comes this wonderful film.

I first watched this movie around 1989.  The school I attended at the time had a VHS copy.  I am a huge Menzel fan, and this movie does not disappoint.  I am still astounded on how good this 1985 film was, and how it still kept with the pre-Prague Spring look and feel.  It also features two great actors: Rudolf Hrusinsky and Zdenek Sverak (who wrote the screenplay and stars in another great Czech movie, 'Kolya').

There are several interlocking stories, but the main story: A small Czech village (still during the late Communist era) is a close-knit community.  Pavek works alongside the 'village idiot', Otik, at a trucking/hauling company.  Pavek is constantly at odds with his partner (by default), and finally gets angry with him, wanting him gone.  Otik is a few cents off, lives by himself (his parents are deceased); he becomes part of a small conspiracy where Westerners are moving into the villages as 'summer homes'. Otik, of course, owns one of these prime properties and someone in the village/company is trying to get him to go to Prague to work so that this house is available (remember: it's the late Commie era).

Other stories concern an adulterous wife, an agricultural accident, and a village celebration.  It's touching, often funny, with dramatic moments galore.  This is Czech filmmaking at its best!  If you love Czech New Wave of the 60s, then you'll really love this movie.  Remember: one has to understand that it is set in the communist era, so some situations may be a bit odd.

Now for the bad:

Available in PAL format only.  This DVD (and the movie in general) is RARE!  I've waited nearly 18 years to find a copy online on DVD.  This copy seems to be a second generation one.  There are some fuzzy and out-of-focus scenes.  The grammar in the subtitles are often bad, even erroneous.  The DVD is in a cardboard sleeve, not a plastic container.  To sum up: This is not a top-of-the-line copy, and I do not believe a better one is available.  However, if you can look past these problems, you'll find a total gem of a movie.

5 of 5 Amazon stars.  3 1/2 of 5 for presentation and quality.",1387670400,2,2235,4.637755102040816
