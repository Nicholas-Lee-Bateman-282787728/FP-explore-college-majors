8637812,5,B00I099JPK,"I enjoy watching reruns from some of the TV shows from many years ago. Some TV shows from yesteryear are much better than some of the ones made today. ""I Dream of Jeannie"" has always been one of my favorite comedies. It doesn't hurt that Barbara Eden played Jeannie. She was smokin' hot and incredibly sexy in her little Jeannie outfit so men love watching her, but the show was tastefully made so that it is pleasant for women and children to watch. When I saw that Amazon had the entire series, I purchased all five seasons. Even though I have not had the time to watch every episode, I have watched at least two episode of every season. Even though they are not as high resolution as Blu-rays are today and considering that most of these episodes originally aired in the late 1960s, they are remarkably sharp. I'm glad I purchased the B&W first season because I wanted them as they are were originally made. The colors in the Seasons 2-5 discs are well saturated, but might be off just a touch. After watching several episodes throughout the entire series, I believe they are the same as I have always seen on reruns without any edits. I have not noticed any differences. Since I know what these are like and if I didn't already own these, I would buy the entire series from Amazon. They are a great value for the price.",1417219200,,1323,4.448559670781893
