7878872,3,6304838107,"Based on The SKU number and Running Time /Name Compared to other releases I expected this one to be something else. However what I got was better then what I expected so let me be very detailed about what I received.

I received the 5 episode set that has the 4 episode ""Movie"" and the bonus episode ""High Nuhn"".
This is the 1 hr 43 min set (Even Though it reads 103 minutes on the back cover) with the picture of a Mummy face on the cover and the cover only reads ""Mummies Alive!"" ""Feature Length"".
This DVD was produced in 1998 (Cover says  MCMXCVIII (Roman Numerals) Equivalent to number 1998).

ISBN# 1-58817-256-2
UPC 0 31398 77222 4

I don't know if DIC themselves caused some confusion by reusing the same UPC or ISBN but  I posted a graphic that clears sup the different releases. Based on what I got I'd say this product had the right cover info for what I received but it doesn't match the description or details. Hopefully my post helps.

To be clear again I received the DVD with the longest running time, 5 episodes and the cover art with the MUMMY FACE on the front.

It has episodes 1 - 5.
 1 ""Ra ra ra""
 2 ""sleepwalk like an Egyptian""
 3  ""Pack to the future""
 4  ""The gift of Geb""
 5  and ""High Nuhn""

The episodes are full length it seems other then the credits and intro missing from episodes 2, 3, Intro only on 1, 5 and credits only on 4, 5",1448323200,2,1361,4.196911196911197
