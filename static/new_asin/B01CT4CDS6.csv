7689635,5,B01CT4CDS6,"Raymond Reddington has got to be my favorite bad/good guy at the moment.  James Spader has breathed life into this role as one of the FBI's top most wanted.  He has moments of incredible evil as well as times of incredible tenderness.  It is amazing to me that after three years of this show, I am still wondering exactly who Reddington is and what he is trying to accomplish.

Season Three is just as good as the first two seasons, which for me were excellent.  Even with Season Three's accommodation of Megan Boone's real-life pregnancy with her character of Elizabeth Keen, which can be a series killer for many shows (remember Moonlighting off-hand), the show continues to build in momentum.

I look forward to seeing which number and name comes up on Reddington's list each week.  What will be their special evil role and how will it benefit Raymond?",1462147200,43,855,4.697986577181208

7689671,5,B01CT4CDS6,"My wife and I have been fans of THE BLACKLIST from the very first episode. For once I was there when a series began rather than come on board years after it was running. The first two season kept us both entertained and on the edge of our seats as we watched the story being told unfold before us. And it has yet to end. Fortunately for those who were not there from the start the series is available on disc with season three the latest.

If you weren't around at the start the story involves a master criminal named Raymond Red Reddington (James Spader) who walks into the headquarters of the FBI with a proposition. The catch is he will only speak to an agent recently made profiler by the name of Elizabeth Liz Keen (Megan Boone). The reason why is unknown but when she shows to a highly secluded and secure facility Red tells her that in return for his release from strict custody he will give the FBI information to take down the most notorious criminals in existence, his cohorts in crime. When asked why her, he alludes to her past and the answers to secrets long buried there.

At the end of season two we found the Cabal, a secret group involving both criminals and government officials ruling the world behind the scenes, framing Elizabeth for the murder of a top government official. This season opens with her on the run, trying to escape from the government, including those she once worked with. With everyone tracking them Liz and Red are seeking a safe location as they try and clear her name.

This season also gave us a greater insight into the man hired by Red to keep an eye on Liz, Tom (Ryan Eggold). Tom went beyond his assignment, marrying Liz and actually falling in love with her. Tom becomes part of team Red as he helps them find the answers and proof they need to save Liz from prison.

At the same time Red still finds a way to assist the FBI group tasked with handling the information he provides them. The names he now gives them, like most that he has presented in the past, in some way assist him in whatever endeavors he has going on at the same time. In this case those whose names he passes along will in some way help him to prove the innocence of Liz.

There are several things that make this series work. The first is the writing. With complicated plot twists and turns that wrap around one another some bits of the story never reveal themselves completely until several episodes later. Items talked about in previous seasons come back to provide more information. It all works and if you become a devoted fan you can follow most. The only thing doing harm to this is the breakup of seasons in half when they air on TV. Remembering who is who and what is going on can be difficult this way. With the season on disc you can watch non-stop and that helps immensely.

The second thing that makes this work are the actors involved. Spader is amazing to watch here. Hes played quirky characters before (Alan Shore on BOSTON LEGAL comes to mind immediately) and more straight laced characters as well. His portrayal of Red here is a combination of bad guy and good guy, a ruthless criminal whose motivations involve emotions and affections rather than the greed and self-preservation that most display. You realize that Red is deadly and at the same time root for him each week. Boone has shown that she is up to the challenge set by Spader with her characterization presenting a woman thrown into a situation she isn't quite prepared for yet adapting with each season, becoming an independent agent who crams so much lifetime into a few years leaving her prepared to handle most situations.

The series is one of the best on TV right now and having it available on discs means fans have the opportunity to go back and watch it all from the start should they choose, a major plus if you enjoy the series. Recent talk has been that hard copy versions such as disc are facing doom with the influx of streaming services. I disagree. Between the internet failing on occasion, mix ups with various services, poor signal strength in some locations and more, the interest in hard copy collections of series like this should be on the increase. When on hand nothing short of power failure can stop you from enjoying the series time and time again. So if you're a fan, or just coming onto this series, pick it up today and begin to enjoy. You won't regret it.",1500163200,,4384,4.479349186483104

7689805,4,B01CT4CDS6,"The Blacklist: The Complete Third Season finds FBI Agent Elizabeth Liz Keen (Megan Boone) a fugitive on the run with criminal mastermind Raymond Red Reddington (James Spader). With assistant FBI Director Harold Cooper (Harry Lennix) under investigation, a conflicted Agent Donald Ressler (Diego Klattenhoff) leads the FBI task force on a massive hunt for Liz and Red. As they struggle to stay one step ahead of their former colleagues, Liz immerses herself in Reds underworld of disreputable contacts and covert operations.

The primary appeal of The Blacklist is James Spader. His Red is one of the best-written characters on network TV  complex, unpredictable, arrogant, and annoyingly self-assured. We always get the impression hes the smartest guy in the room, making his intricate machinations and ability to operate on the fence between the law and the underworld believable. Spader has always been able to convey an off-center personality. His Red is yet another portrayal that captivates as it repels, making him fascinating to watch.

Guest stars in Season 3 include Tony Shalhoub (TVs Monk), Leslie Jones (Ghostbusters, Saturday Night Live), Brian Dennehy (TVs Death of a Salesman), and Famke Janssen (X-Men).

The 5-disc Blu-ray set contains 23 episodes. Special features include episode commentaries, deleted and extended scenes, and several making-of behind-the-scenes featurettes including From the Shadows: Villains of Season 3, Creating the Stunts: Script to Screen, and a compilation of Reds memorable lines from Season 3.",1471564800,6,1539,5.536170212765957

This is one of the better shows on TV and the time it is on makes it difficult for me to watch during the active season. I wait anxiously for the release to DVD. This is another series that does not get enough promotion. It is a very intense storyline which leaves you with all these questions about who Raymond Reddington really is in relation to Elizabeth Keen. There are times when you don't know who is on which side and even what the 'sides' are. This is not a series that you can skip around and watch an episode here and there. If you try that you will have no clue what is going on. The actions of the main characters will surprise you and their attitudes given the circumstances at any given time will boggle the mind. If you like movies that challenge you on what you think is 'right & wrong' then you will enjoy this series.",1471219200,14,916,4.204545454545454

8754117,5,B01CT4CDS6,"As Season 3 gets underway the manhunt for ex-FBI Agent Keen is underway. It's much harder for Keen because she shot the Attorney General, but his last words to her and Harold Cooper were that there was nothing they could do about it. Reddington of course has other ideas and that is to take the fight to the Cabal and in he first half of the season that is just what he & Liz do.

A truce of sorts is reached with the capture and exposing of the Director of the Cabal and Clandestine Services at the CIA. Liz is cleared of all charges except that shooting of AG. She gets 3 years probation but loses her job at the FBI and her ability to carry a gun. It becomes common knowledge who she is (was), a daughter of a Russian spy and now has less anonymity than she had before (because now more people know that she was born to Russians).

As the season progresses Liz we find is pregnant and wants to marry Tom at a church and the wedding is interrupted by a group of 26 people armed to the teeth and being directed with someone like Aram using a defunct satellite network. They fail in their mission to capture Liz whom we find out is the target but wanted alive. A chase ensues and Liz eventually holds up at a club turned emergency hospital. Tom is now a loan parent who wants to avenge his wife's death and at the same time has to take care of the baby who is premature. This is one of the saddest moments of the series. How could the writers do this? What were they thinking?

The next episode is one of the strangest ones in that it's really about Red and what is going on in his mind. That episode ends with Red stumbling across a guy who was using a metal detector to dig up what turns out to be a locket from Liz's mom who supposedly committed suicide on that same beach some 25+ years earlier. What?

Later we learn that Tom and the baby are on their way to meet Liz who is still alive and it was Mr. Kaplan who decided that her commitment was to Liz and her baby, Agnes, ahead of Raymond. We also learn that Tom (who went by the name of Jacob Phelps) has a Mom whom he wanted to kill by the name of Susan Hargrave because she was working for Alexander Kirk who we come to find in the end says that he is Liz's father, Konstatin Rostatov and has both Liz and the Baby who is on the way to him.

So more threads were sown up and new threads created and unraveled. The show is entertaining and at times hard to follow. I am hooked and now watching Season 4
