8507777,5,B0070HVOKQ,Just finished watching El Negocio. Lots of quality Kenpo in this movie. I enjoyed the fight scenes and base story. Wife and I both cracked up with the comic relief (bum) who kept showing up in different parts of the movie. If you are looking for a classic style martial arts movie featuring the art of American Kenpo then check this one out!,1519948800,,341,4.428571428571429
8507778,5,B0070HVOKQ,"This was a low-budget movie and I knew that when I bought it.  For being low budget it was really quite good.  It reminded me a little of the old Van Damme or Chuck Norris movies from the 1980s.  Lots of action, both with guns and hand to hand, plus a good deal of Spanish being spoken.  If you study Spanish, the Spanish language in the video just makes it better.  If you don't speak Spanish no worries, the Spanish words are translated on screen, and there is a lot more English being spoken in the movie than Spanish.

I recommend this movie fully.  It was obviously made cheaply, but there was appropriate music, the setting (Bogota) was great, and the fights were good.  It was better than a lot of movies that cost a lot more to make.",1388534400,,741,4.280575539568345
