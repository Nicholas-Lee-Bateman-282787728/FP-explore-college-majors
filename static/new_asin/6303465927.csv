652302,5,6303465927,"So far only available on VHS in Region 1, I picked up the Region 2 DVD release of `Face of Fu Manchu' recently and blessed my region-free DVD player for every wonderful fun-filled moment of this enjoyable fantasy romp.

Based on the character originally envisioned by British author Sax Rohmer, Christopher Lee made a total of five appearances in the 1960s as arch villain Fu Manchu. This entry (the first in the series) is by far the best, closely followed by the second `Brides of Fu Manchu' (another Region 2 only DVD release).

What makes this entry so enjoyable is the wonderful Nigel Green as Fu Manchu's greatest nemesis - Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard. In fact it is in the opening minutes of this movie that we see Smith invited by the Chinese government to witness the execution of Fu Manchu.

Fast forward a couple of months and Smith is sturdy in his belief that Fu Manchu survived and is behind a series of grisly crimes in western Europe. Then when a professors servant is found murdered in the same manner in which Fu Manchu's followers had practiced, Smith becomes even more convinced that he is up against the evil genius.

Through a series of machinations Smith learns that the professor has been kidnapped by Fu Manchu and is being forced to make a toxin that could wipe out most of the western world. Of course (in a plot device also used in the following `Brides of Fu Manchu') the professors daughter has also been captured and is being used to  comply the professor to complete his task.

Directed with skill by Don Sharp this movie is fast-paced enough to overlook the plot holes and colorful enough to keep the fun factor umpped up to the ultimate degree. It's a visual feast and the movie is also helped by a tight script and some well drawn characters. I grew up watching these movies on British television and my memories did not disappoint me.

Also notable is the inclusion of one-time Bond girl Karin (You Only Live Twice) Dor ho turns in a strong performance as the professors daughter.

This is an ultimate Saturday afternoon movie to be watched relaxed in a recliner with a bag of popcorn in one hand and a soda in the other, all the while reveling in every outlandish moment.",1102896000,9,2211,4.579746835443038

(Seems a pretentious term to use for such a cheesy but fun movie collection.) Nothing like a horde of Burmese Dacoits running through the streets of London to make life more interesting.

652468,4,6303465927,"- Scotland Yard Asst. Commissioner, Sir Nayland Smith: ""There's a man who I thought was dead. Now I believe he's still alive. He's cruel, callous, brilliant, and the most evil and dangerous man in the world.""

1965's THE MASK OF FU MANCHU was Christopher Lee's first and best try at Sax Rohmer's pulp adventure franchise featuring Fu Manchu. It's got the vibe of a Hammer Film and evokes that feel of the Saturday afternoon serial. All good tug-of-wars between good and evil requires a memorable villain, and Fu Manchu, that Devil Doctor, that manipulative master of hypnotism, that diabolical Chinese arch-villain, certainly brought to the table exotic intrigue, palpable smarts, and a pervasive sense of menace.

The film opens in Tibet as the intrepid Sir Nayland Smith (Nigel Green) witnesses the formal execution and decapitation of his long-time nemesis, Fu Manchu. Except we all know this death won't take. Some time later Smith is back in London and soaking in disturbing news concerning a rash of murders by strangulation. Smith works the math and arrives at the only logical conclusion: dang Ye11ow Peril's back!

When I was a kid, boy, did I steep myself in Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu books. I thrilled to a batch of Fu Manchu movies, some bad, some good, all fun. I saw the 1932 version of THE MASK OF FU MANCHU with Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy, and I'm hard pressed to say which movie I prefer. The 1932 film oozed atmosphere and high camp whereas the 1965 picture packed in the frenetic action. Also a good 'un was Republic Pictures' DRUMS OF FU MANCHU, a 15-episode serial released in 1940. In comic books, back in the '70s, I fondly remember Fu Manchu as father to Shang Chi, one of my all-time favorite Marvel characters. So, yeah, son, the Devil Doctor was an old, familiar friend.

Christopher Lee would make four sequels, but none of those would be as good as this first one. There's such good energy generated here. Director Don Sharp strikes a nice balance between suspenseful storytelling and the tongue-in-cheek stuff. Sharp depends mightily on extended action set pieces to drive the narrative over the occasional slow spot. Sir Nayland Smith has never been more the two-fisted man of action, his relentless resolve proving to be ample counterpoint to Fu Manchu's insidious intelligence. Nigel Green plays Smith as steely-eyed and supremely undeterred and physical, this physicality matched by his coincidental colleague, the equally two-fisted biochemist's assistant, Carl Jannsen (Joachim Fuchsberg). Meanwhile, Lee, with his reptilian gaze and oh-so-deliberate gestures, captures the essence of calculated evil and unslaked ambition. Then, again, that's Christopher Lee in just about every role he's had. So, if you're jonesing for a bit of larger-than-life oriental deviltry versus western derring-do... If you care to set eyes on an excellent recreation of 1920s London... If you admire a hero's arsenal of karate chops, judo throws, and that go-to move of the western man-of-action - the wicked right cross... If you can generously grin at the big bad's silly machinations (this time out, Fu Manchu means to destroy London by releasing a poison gas distilled from the seeds of the Tibetan black hill poppy)... If you want to see the good guys, in several drag-out action sequences, take on Fu Manchu's minions, them cultish Dacoites (the extended brawl in the museum basement is really awesome)... And if you want to see Fu Manchu masquerade as a frail woman... well, consider this movie as your new jam.",1430697600,,3531,5.020477815699659

652471,2,6303465927,"This was probably great in its time, but, now, it's just too predictiable and boring.  Christopher Lee is great as always, but he's given shamefully little to do in this movie despite playing the title character.  It opens with the execution of Fu Manchu.  Or so it seems.  But crime is back up and no one knows why.  A scientist is lured to a deserted building and kidnapped by none other than Fu Manchu.  Who wants the scientist to develop a poison to blackmail the government.  He forces the scientist to do this by kidnapping his daughter and threatening to torture her.  He demonstrates his evil by shoving a minion into a chamber and flooding it with water from the river.  In the meantime, a detective is trying to locate Fu Manchu and utterly fails in protecting the scientist's daughter and anyone else.  Fu Manchu then makes his demands to the governments by poisoning an entire town.  But Fu has a problem.  He needs the special ingrediants to mass produce his poison.  The final showdown, if you want to call it that, takes place on a mountain abbey with monks.  Why these monks allow Fu and don't notice Englishmen among their ranks is another mystery.  And by this time, you probably won't care.  Even Christopher Lee can't save this movie.  And that's saying a lot from seeing Mr. Lee in many other horror flicks.  Maybe if Peter Cushing had been along, it would have been a better movie.",1408233600,,1403,4.588709677419355

That said, this is the best of the Christopher Lee Fu's, with some good nefarious tortures and diabolical planning and Nayland Smith even more idiotic than usual.

652512,4,6303465927,"You have to wonder what Warner Bros. is thinking at times.  For years they have had the U.S. home video rights to the first three/best three (of the five) Fu Manchu films starring Christopher Lee, which were long only available on VHS.  Meanwhile, the last two films in the franchise (directed by Jess Franco and generally regarded as the weakest entries in the series) were given deluxe DVD treatment by Blue Underground.  So when the folks at WB finally decided to debut Fu Manchu on DVD, instead of going with THE FACE OF FU MANCHU (the film that started it all) they picked film #2, BRIDES OF FU MANCHU, and paired it with CHAMBER OF HORRORS for a DVD double feature.  This would have been fine if they would have at least paired their remaining two Fu's as a second DVD double feature.  But FACE OF FU MANCHU and the third film, VENGEANCE OF FU MANCHU, were allowed to gather dust for a few more years before Warner finally dumped them onto no-frills DVD-Rs as part of their Archives Collection.  This film, and the fans, deserved better.

Warner has said the DVD-R/MOD format is cheaper to use, but they certainly don't pass the savings onto their customers, as these titles tend to run higher than a real DVD.  If a company like VCI can use the DVD-R format and reduce the price to reflect the cost-cutting approach of MOD, there is no reason Warner (and other major studios) could not follow suit.  Sadly, Warners has started taking a number of titles previously released on DVD and reissuing them as DVD-R, at the higher price but without the bonus features of the original discs.  (Leaving the consumer to pay more for less.)  Given how many ""boutique"" labels release deluxe DVD editions of obscure Euro-horror to an appreciative audience, Warner Bros. could have easily done the same here.  Even their more high-profile library of classic Hammer Horror titles have been treated indifferently by the studio on DVD.  Given how many times this issue with WB has been addressed in reviews, both in print and on line, you can't help but feel Warner doesn't really understand what it's got.  With the recent BFI restorations done on HORROR OF DRACULA, CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and Hammer's THE MUMMY, coupled with the deluxe DVD/Blu-Ray combo packs of some of the other Hammer titles, the market for this material is out there.  And while the Fu Manchu films are not Hammer productions, the presence of Christopher Lee has given that franchise its own following.",1368662400,4,2464,4.737704918032787
652513,5,6303465927,"...of both Christopher Lee and Fu Manchu, I can easily dismiss the occasionally stodgy pace and low-budget of this film.

652515,5,6303465927,"This is a review of the Warner Archive burn on demand DVD.

Fu Manchu plans to dominate the world through the use of the poisonous extract of a rare Tibetan poppy. The only problem is that the extract is unstable above the freezing point. Fu threatens to torture the daughter of a scientist unless he finds a way to stabilize the poison. With Nayland Smith (Nigel Green) on the case, time is running out. This may be the best of the five Christopher Lee Fu Manchu films -- though ""The Brides of Fu Manchu"" is a very close second.

The film is widescreen (2.35:1) and in very good condition. The DVD comes in a case with a printed cover just like a regular DVD. However, there are absolutely no extras -- the only menu choice is ""play""!

652516,3,6303465927,"The Warner MOD DVD costs $20, so it's enticing to rent this title rather than buy but there's so little information about picture format (standard vs widescreen) and picture quality (480i, 480p or 720p) that I'm hesitating. Has anyone compared the picuture quality of MOD vs Instant?
I rented the movie based Hudak's positive comments. First the good news the movie (story & acting) are as good as I remember from my childhood. Now the bad news, Warner has done Amazon a dis-service by not supplying the recent anamorphic DVD master. The video starts letterboxed (and riddled with artifacts) and then transitions to fullscreen after a few minutes (fewer artifacts, muddy picture quality) this may be a clue as whether a VHS or laserdisc master was supplied to Amazon.
I enjoyed the movie enough to consider putting the Warner Archive MOD DVD on my Xmas list.

652517,4,6303465927,"Warner Archive has finally released a beautiful 2.35 DVD-R transfer of Director Don Sharp's 'THE FACE OF FU MANCHU'-1965, the first time the film has had a digital release in this country and which was the victim of poor pan and scan VHS tape and Laser disc fodder over the years. The colors are much richer and the lavishness of the scope image makes the film look more expensive than it probably was.  Christopher Lee will never look as good in the role as in this first and best outing donning oriental makeup (not the first time, however, having sadistically tore up the screen as Chung King in Director Anthony Bushell's 'THE TERROR OF THE TONGS'- 1961 for Hammer Films) and gleefully sneering at every obstacle put forward by his daughter Lin Tang played beautifully by actress Tsai Chin who would also appear in all films of the series and placed at the feet of nemesis Sir Nayland Smith played by Nigel Green in his sole outing of the series and one of his best performances.  Producer Harry Allen Towers would steadily worsen the series by cutting the budgets and eventually handing over the Director's mantle to Jess Franco who would release the last two films and reduce Lee's performance to that of his Hammer Count Dracula as just standing around and spouting out orders. This film also blends the British with the German Edgar Walace Krimi's by having actress Karin Dor and Joachim Fuchsberger along for the ride.  It is photographed in gritty fashion by Ernest Steward who graced the Diana Rigg/Emma Peal seasons of 'THE AVENGERS' with his camerawork and has a brassy music score by Christopher Whelen.  The screenplay is by Towers here billed as Peter Welbeck loosely based on the Sax Rohmer characters.  Sharp directs excellently bringing a combination of espionage and comic book formulas to the proceedings especially at the explosive climax at Fu Manchu's monastery.  As Lee echoes at the end of the film 'The world shall hear from me again', it most certainly would but not as excellently as in this first atmospheric excursion.",1349395200,6,2049,4.823361823361823
7847603,3,6303465927,"The best of the Harry Alan Towers produced Fu Manchu films, I doubt that Sax Rohmer's ""yellow peril"" films would do well today--the inherent racism isn't as obvious here as the Karloff film nor as the novels by Rohmer (the one name of prolific author Arthur Henry Ward) but those elements are still evident in this Irish shot production.

After witnessing the execution of his archnemesis Fu Manchu (Christopher Lee), Nayland Smith (the always superb Nigel Greene) comes to the conclusion that he must still be alive based on the criminal activity he encounters. Smith discovers that Fu Manchu has kidnapped a scientist to create a biological toxin in order to blackmail the world. Smith, with his trusted sidekick Dr. Petrie (Howard Marion Crawford playing a Dr. Watson type character against Smith's Sherlock Holmes) contact the scientist's daughter (Karin Dor) in hope of assistance in finding her father (Walter Arbilla).

This DVD from Warner Archieves looks and sounds pretty good. Color's are bold and there's some nice depth here. Shot in the cheaper Techniscope (used also at various points by Hammer--Hammer called it Hammerscope but it was a hallmark of smaller budgeted films as it saved n the cost of the film itself by exposing not half of a frame. The result is a format, because of the diminished area of the frame and, if blown up could,potentially be higher in grain and, if not lit right, wouldn't look optimal. Luckily, that's not the case here.

Towers (a suspected Soviet spy) specialist in B-movies that marquee value; the films he produced would often feature a well known film star (in this case Christopher Lee) and, occasionally, a good to competent director (Don Sharp who also helmed the remakes of ""The 39 Steps"", ""The Four Feathers"" as well as ""Curse of The Fly"", ""Rasputin The Mad Monk"" and episodes of ""The Avengers""). Don sharp who directed the film would later be recognized as a solid action director eventually drifting into TV films based on romantic novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford.

Sharp's direction creates the cartoony/pulp vibe of the film. There isn't much character development but sharp benefits from having two terrific actors--Nigel Greene as Scotland Yard's Nayland Smith and, of course, Christopher Lee who makes a striking presence as Fu Manchu. As Lee notes in his autobiography, he felt ""the first one should have been the last as it was the only good movie"". Lee was seduced to make four more by money (certainly the scripts weren't the reasons) and the chance to visit exotic locals (Brazil, Hong Kong) while Greene never returned to the role which is a pity as he brought a physicality and energy to the role.

The first film remains the best in the series and the racism remains largely below the surface. Rohmer's novels and some of the other adaptions are more blunt and explicitly racist with Smith espousing most of the racist rhetoric in the films and/or novels. The Towers films do still play to the stereotype of the evil Asian mastermind (the character of Fu Manchu's daughter is also a sadist as portrayed in the Towers films) to the white savior of Smith.

Despite the flaws, ""The Face of Fu Manchu"" remains an entertaining film (which can't be said for three of the five films in this series). Although I feel that Lee was miscast, he executes his role well.

There aren't any special features on the Warner Archieves release and no subtitles although the dialog remains clear, the audience for this film might need subtitles. Be aware that, for a time. This was a DVD-R. I don't know if Warner continues to burn these rather than press them (I have an early edition from 2012 that is a pressed DVD).

Made in a racially less aware time, ""The Face of Fu Manchu"" remains largely entertaining because the blunt racism from Rohmer's novels aren't in evidence beyond the Asian stereotypes. The Warner release looks quite nice. It would be great to get a Blu-Ray release for this film so nice this is the vest of the film series.",1499212800,,3995,4.830409356725146

With one exception, I was not able to suspend disbelief during the movie. The one exception was a car chase, with Nayland Smith's Scotland Yard Austin 16/6 Burnham Saloon chasing Fu Manchu's 21 HP 1926 Lanchester.
