5681739,5,B00BY6XM7C,"We have always enjoyed Rick Steves shows on PBS, this gives us ongoing access to them. The outtakes that are included are quite funny.",1394150400,,134,4.625
5681740,5,B00BY6XM7C,"The shows are really great. I'll never be able to go these places, until now. I have some friends come over and we will watch a couple of shows. Every one really likes how everything is put together it's so very interesting.",1391472000,4,224,4.357142857142857
5681741,5,B00BY6XM7C,"This collection of 100 Rick Steves shows focusing on European tour destinations also includes helpful episodes on Travel Skills, Rick Steves Tour Experience, European Christmas and additional shows focusing on non-European sites like Turkey and Israel.  Acquiring all of these shows would probably cost several times the amount you would pay for the comprehensive set.  If you are serious about traveling, this set is an invaluable tool.  --- You might be able to acquire this set directly from Rick Steves (sometimes at a major discount) if you go to their web-site.",1388707200,11,567,5.208791208791209
5681742,5,B00BY6XM7C,"This is a very good bargain- over 50 hours of viewing. My wife and I have been working our way through this during the last few
weeks. The photography is beautiful! and Rick is an excellent tour guide. However, for pedestrian travelers who like to
see the big attractions and don't have a lot of time to spend, you may find some things missing. I don't think Versailles
appears for example. And I would have loved to see more of the Greek islands (we lived in Athens for 2 years),and
attractions like the cable car on Santorini.  Greek islands like Rhodes,Corfu,Mykonos,Crete would be valuable
additions-and they are not available on any DVDs  in any substantial way. Perhaps Rick could add these in the future.",1384819200,5,711,4.725806451612903

8575266,5,B00BY6XM7C,I bought this DVD set to learn about each of the main point of interest each of the cities/countries has to offer in order to plan my vacation properly and get the most out of it.

We are visiting Spain next year and have viewed several of the DVD's and they got us so much more excited to visit!  I highly recommend this set!!!",1408924800,,286,4.089285714285714
8575271,5,B00BY6XM7C,"We had previously bought Rick's series on France. It was so much better than any other videos we had bought on France, that we bought the entire series. If you are planning a trip to Europe, this is a must see.  In very interesting 30 minute episodes, Rick takes you to one or more of the locations that you are apt to visit. He mixes the past with the present in a very interesting format,  This series also includes some bonus footage on travel to Europe in general. You won't be disappointed with any of his products. His Europe Through the Back Door books are great.",1407196800,,570,4.367924528301887
