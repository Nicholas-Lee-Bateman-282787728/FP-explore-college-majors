The video is old however ('classic') I wish it included some of the modern goals, like the fantastic Michael Owen Goal during the '98 Finals Vs Argentina, that was a classic but you can't have everything in life.
This has Gazza, Pele, Maradona, All the top names and some people many people won't even remember, but one thing is for sure, these are the best goals of the past 50 or so years of world cup history.  If your moving away to a country were football is called 'Soccer' and your afraid your going to miss some of the action, watch this and remember why its the best sport on Earth.
4 Stars.",1061337600,3,807,4.482993197278912

7832617,4,6302957915,"Making a highlight film for the 82, 86 and 90 World Cup should be easy, just compile all the excellent footages and let the action speaks for itself.  Which is exactly what this video does!
It categorizes the action into wing plays, individual skill, goal poaching, freekicks, etc; which is a nice touch.  It is relatively long compared to other soccer videos and doesn't rush things or unnecessarily prolong the process with too much replay. The music is weak and the narration borders on lecturing, but who cares. The soccer is good.",1008288000,4,535,4.804347826086956
7832618,4,6302957915,This was a good video that showed a lot of great plays. I liked the fact that it showed some of the same goals over and from different angles. It gave you an idea of what lead up to the goal without having to rewind all  the time. I got it to share with my son and daughter and their teams. I  think it makes for good pre-game watching. Overall the quality of the video  was good although some of the older film was of lesser quality because of  it's age.,957139200,13,455,3.967032967032967
7832619,3,6302957915,"The video contains goals from 3 world cups '82,1986 and 1990. So you don't get to see the goals of Pele's Brazil(which was a minor disappointment).Although  the selection of goals contains some excellent  goals it was not the best set of goals.
All in all, a good video for a  football fan. Enjoy some great goals but don't expect to see all the best  goals of the World Cup.",954028800,32,375,4.391304347826087
