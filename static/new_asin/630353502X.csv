7849903,1,630353502X,I would rate a zero if I could for their DVD . For one thing it comes from Canadian post and took forever to receive. Then the DVD will not play because it is not for this region (US). It appears to be Irish or something . Out $14 dollars. Buyers beware.,1525996800,,254,3.9038461538461537
7849904,4,630353502X,"Although more than eighty years old, this film is still fun to watch. It stars Fred MacMurray who does a fine acting job, as do the other actors. Lloyd Nolan gets fourth billing as the outlaw chief and Gabby Hayes, called George Hayes in this film, has the twelfth and last billing. He is a crooked judge. It also has a young boy in the film to draw on our feelings, a woman who plays the love interest of MacMurray  he is reluctant to get involved and tied to apron strings, a man who gets second billing who is MacMurrays closest friends who sings in the film, and parts that are humorous and others where there is action: a fight against Indians where the Rangers are outnumbered 50 to I, and several one-on-one shootouts.
The plot focuses on three friends who are bandits. Two of them join the Texas Rangers with the idea that as Rangers they will learn of gold shipments and be able to rob the shipment. The third, who becomes separated from them, becomes a successful bandit chief. After a while, because of circumstances depicted in the film, the two decide to go straight and they go after their prior comrade.",1499299200,,1118,4.480392156862745

Directed by King Vidor

Jim Hawkins (Fred MacMurray) is one of three outlaws working the Lone Star State in the years following the Civil War. Both Hawkins and his partner in crime Wahoo Jones (Jack Oakie) decide to go straight, but their bandit pal Sam McGee (Lloyd Nolan) has not quite seen the light. Eventually, Jim and Wahoo join the fledgling Texas Rangers, an organization dedicated to bringing law, order and honest government to their state, while McGee cuts a swath of terror with his new gang. The two reformed outlaws are assigned to bring in their old friend Sam to justice.

Released to coincide with the Texas Centennial, The Texas Rangers is a sprawling historical western made with the full cooperation of the real-life Texas Rangers.
