3730834,5,B001OMZYHM,Perfect. Its great on blu-ray and having all Broly movies on one disc makes it easier to own all the DBZ movies in blu-ray with plenty of space for games.,1256688000,,154,4.166666666666667
3730835,5,B001OMZYHM,"The legendary super saiyajin in his own triple pack! The fights are intense, ruthless, and full of testosterone. If there's one saiyajin you should fear, it should be the killing machine Broly.",1246492800,4,193,5.0625
3730836,5,B001OMZYHM,"Dragon Ball Z movies are fun to watch but seeing thid Blu-Ray version blows away how someone grew up seeing DBZ. The picture/image quality are nice. This Blu-Ray brings all 3 Broly movies ( Movies 8,10 & 11), in a better bargain than that double disc of Broly previously release. Any DBZ fan should get this Blu-Ray instalment and hope the series (DB,DBZ,DBGT) comes soon in Blu-Ray it's worth all the money and pennies.",1243209600,2,420,4.6891891891891895
3730837,5,B001OMZYHM,"Like all of Funimations recent Dragonball Z releases, this one promises to demonstrate DBZ in true remastered form. The show has never really looked better, and for you PS3 or Blu-Ray player owners, this one is available in blu-ray as well. Now, unlike Funimations recent DBZ movie releases, this holds three movies, instead of the usual double feature. The first two are the strongest point of this collection, with the third being there mainly for comic relief, but nevertheless I recommend this product, especially for the price.",1242518400,3,532,5.126436781609195
3730838,4,B001OMZYHM,"To the person that thinks they just re-released this to tick people off, they didn't.  FUNimation is re-releasing all of there movies with original Japanese audio, something that the fans all wanted in the first place, better than that crap music they paid US performers to do for the movies.  All of the steelbook movies as well as the new re-released Bluray versions have all Japanese audio tracks with English Dub.  Smart Move FUNimation you won yourself back a fan.",1238544000,7,469,4.8375

instead of this realese the one that we need is movies 11, 12 and 13 on one blu-ray not a compilation of Broly AGAIN!!",1235174400,4,336,4.184615384615385

3730841,5,B001OMZYHM,"Funimation is still releasing the DBZ movies in their new remastered Blu-Ray/Steelbook DVD formats. Some fans may be disappointed if they bought the Broly features when they came out in the Blu-Ray pack recently, but for those who haven't purchased them yet, or only have the old regular DVD versions from a few years ago and want to upgrade, this is the way to do it.

This set containt DBZ Movies 8, 10, 11.

BROLY: THE LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYIN
This is probably the main reason for fans to buy this and is definitely the best of the three seen here, and some would argue the best out of all thirteen movies. It's storyline begins way back when Goku was a crying baby Kakarot on the planet Vegeta and introduces another baby Saiyin, Broly, who didn't care much for his cries. Then the story picks up again years later when another surviving Saiyan, Paragus, interrupts the Z-Fighter's picnic by dropping by in a large space ship. He has come to invite Goku and Vegeta to the new planet Vegeta and most of the other Z-Fighter's and sidekicks go along. While on the planet they meet Paragus' son Broly and are told of the Legendary Super Saiyan and that one is still causing trouble in the universe. Vegeta deals with his own issues of learning of a more powerful super saiyan than he and there is some good character moments for him. Goku deals with trying to track down the supposed Legendary Super Saiyin with his instant transmission. In the end after the character's investigate some mysteries it obviously turns out that Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyin and a revenge plot is revealed. Broly transforms again and goes on a greater rampage than ever before against Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Piccolo and for the first time in a DBZ movie Super Saiyan Gohan. It has some really good fight scenes and action. It has another ending where everyone feeds their energy to Goku as the planet is falling apart around them, but the key here is that Vegeta's broken pride of being defeated may get in the way of him giving Goku the energy he needs to defeat Broly. Great movie, 5 stars.

BROLY: SECOND COMING
This story feels more like a Dragon Ball plot with a DBZ villain who just happens to be in it. Goten, Trunks and Videl have some funny moments in the Dragon Ball style set up of them looking for the seven magic balls only to end up trying to solve the problems a village is having with it's angry god. This gets interrupted when Broly arrives on the scene and in a rage (which he always seems to be in) goes after Goten believing him to be Goku. The two young boys comically try to fight against the villain who was so imposing in his first appearance in movie 8, and Gohan shows up to help while there is a funny cameo of Krillin showing up to save Gohan dressed as Piccolo. However, everything that happens in this movie is leading to the final showdown where by serendipity Goku breifly rejoins his two sons and with Trunks help they send Broly into the sun. I like this movie, it's just a different style from the rest. Of the various movies throughout the thirteen that tryed something a little different this one is more entertaining to me than say Bio-Broly or even Fusion Reborn. Good movie, 3 or 4 stars depending.

BIO-BROLY
When a millionare and the priest from the village the boys saved in the last feature team up to engineer bio-fighters on their secluded island labratory they invite Mr. Satan, the world champ, to fight them and test their strength. When Goten, Trunks and Android 18 join along they soon realize the last and most powerful Bio-Fighter is a clone of Broly. DBZ is known for great science fiction elements but this isn't pulled off too well considering. Trunks and Goten essentially repeat the last movie only instead of fighting the real Broly they fight a clone who ends up turning into green goo that soon overtakes the island destroying it. The story in this one wasn't fleshed out or focused enough on for me, it's very much tossed aside to allow more scenes of the boys being humorous and fighting Broly, or what's left of him. Still anything DBZ is entertaining for fans so 3 stars for them, but I wouldn't recommend this one on it's own to anyone else.

Luckily I don't have to recommend it on it's own because it's in this packaged set with the two other fine movies and being offered at a much more affordable price than these features used to be. The cases are nice and line up well on a shelf with complimentary artwork and safe storage for your valuable discs. The cases for the Blu-Ray are just normal Blu-Ray cases and not steelbook, but they still have great complimentary artwork on them. I find picture and audio quality on these remasters to be excellent, but I'm the type who hadn't found it that bad before.

All in all a great DBZ movie with two more entertaining ones included all at a great price and with nice packaging. All this leaves now is movies 12 and 13, Fusion Reborn, and another fan favorite, Wrath Of The Dragon. They will probably be coming out before summer coinciding perfectly with the ninth and final DBZ series boxed set, containing the remaining Fusion and Kid Buu sagas. It will be a sad day rewatching the ending of such an iconic anime again, but we still have a little time before that comes. Thanks for your time.",1233532800,18,5299,4.5318704284221525

The cases are nice and line up well on a shelf with complimentary artwork and safe storage for your valuable discs. The cases are the size of a regular single DVD case, but heavier on account of the steelbook, and hold a DVD on the inside of each cover, this one I'll assume will have a middle folding holder attached at the spine to allow for the third disc. That is unless they put two features or more one one disc because of the similar themed villain in this set, but they haven't bothered with that before.

3730843,5,B001OMZYHM,"I always knew they would put all 3 Broly movies in one box set, since there are 13 DBZ movies. This box set contains whats in my opinion the best Dragonball Z movie, the first Broly movie. Theres never a dull moment, from beginning to end theres action. My favorite part deals with Vegeta, I won't spoil anything about this movie but you learn a lot about him in this movie. The other 2 movies are great movies in their own right, but the first one is reason enough to buy this.",1232496000,,478,4.206521739130435

He has no personality whatsoever and I find it hard to believe that brolly is a ""favorite"" character of many DBZ fans.. are you kidding me!? He is the most plain and boring character ever made.

Video quality for this remastered blu-ray was excellent. Cropping was minimal due to Funimation restoring some of the footage removed in the original tv broadcast. Colours are bright and I saw little video artefacting. Considering the age of these movies (20+ years), I have no complaints. Likewise, the audio was quite good. All 3 Broly movies on one blu-ray disc for a fair price. My first DBZ movie blu-ray was movies 12 and 13, so this leaves 8 movies on 4 discs, plus a disc for the two specials. I definitely plan to buy the remaining discs when I can afford them, as the video quality far surpasses the dvd versions available. 7 discs for 13 movies and 2 specials makes for compact space beside my dragonbox DBZ series and my older Dragonball dvds.

Oh, well. What I paid for it, was well worth it. The first one really is a classic.
I recommend for all fans of Dragon Ball Z!",1392422400,,256,4.03921568627451

I'm surprised that all the Dragonball Z double/tripe feature Blu Ray releases are all almost perfect! Looks great, English with Japanese and American soundtrack as well as the original Japanese version as well.

Could use some special features, but that's really no big deal. A great release!",1392336000,3,402,5.0

3730961,5,B001OMZYHM,I love the broly movies. I also love the original Japanese score. These are some of the only movies I listen to with the English score. Broly beats the crap out of everybody in all three movies.,1360886400,,194,4.27027027027027

3730966,4,B001OMZYHM,Great Bluray movie. Has all three films in English and japenese. Not much beyond that. Picture and sound are great.,1341100800,,115,4.8
3730967,3,B001OMZYHM,The first of the three movies was the best because they had a little history on the saiyans which was cool. I didn't like the back story on why Broly hated Goku. That was kinda lame. The second is pretty good too. It's basically pure action start to finish. And the third one is a bit rediculous. Just a clone of him that turns to a green turd and starts fighting again. He doesn't even look that cool. A bit disappointed to say the least. The music for both english dubs are pretty good. All in all a good buy for the two first movies.,1307059200,,536,4.114285714285714

3730971,2,B001OMZYHM,"The best thing I can say for this DVD is that it's a 3 in 1 feature for a cheap price. They come  with the standard Funimation remastering with Japanese dialog and English subtitles(English dub is also included, but I can't watch dubbed anime, so I won't comment on that). They are classic anime movies that go around 1 hour or slightly above that...you can easily watch all 3 in one sitting...2 of them combined gives you what a normal movie would take.

The movies themselves are a bit of a letdown, which kind of tells you why the 3 Broly movies were combined into this single package. The first movie will explain Broly's back story and why he is as strong as he is, but the other two after that I felt like they had to reach to make it plausible...Broly is supposed to be this unstoppable villain, but in the 2nd and 3rd movies they make him look extremely weak compared to the first one. This is a far cry from the first film, whose ending made no sense because it seemed like they were running out of time on the film, and decided just to end it without a plausible way to do so.

This is something you'd buy if you want to fill out your DBZ collection, but all 3 movies are easily skipped. I bought these because I was curious as to the back story of Broly, but after watching these, I felt like there are better DBZ movies out there for your money.",1261440000,,1357,4.231660231660232

8330921,5,B001OMZYHM,Broly Is my favorite DBZ character so im really biased in saying i love this Blu-ray. This comes both Dubbed and Subbed with The Pantera song/US soundtrack. All the weird film cuts are still in them movies too so its exactly the same as the original from back in the day. Broly isn't for everyone but like OP planet busting villains with actual back stories this is the movie for you.,1518048000,,384,4.422535211267606
