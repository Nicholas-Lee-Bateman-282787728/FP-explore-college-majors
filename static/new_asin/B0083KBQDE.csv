8524563,5,B0083KBQDE,Let me start with the bad. This is obviously a digital copy of old VHS tapes. BUT...the content is simply some of the best hapkido related content out there. This is a MUST have for any practitioner of hapkido. It is also an EXCELLENT resource for instructors. Purchase with confidence.,1370908800,,286,4.74
8524564,1,B0083KBQDE,"This DVD set contains 3 ""Hapkido Ultimate Self Defence"" DVDs and 3 ""Hapkido Dynamite"" DVDs. The first 3 DVDs which run for 90 minutes each do not play on computers ( I tried on several versions, Microsoft and Mac). To play those DVDs on a DVD player is also very complicated. All 3 DVDs start from a top menue which is just black screen with blue lines and a font as on the old DOS computers. Then you need to click on a first line, then on Play line, then the black screen will appear for about 5 minutes, then the video recording will appear. The videos do not have and menue buttons to jump to the chapters you want. Also the quality is blurry and is annoying for eyes. Although instruction is not bad for an absolute beginner who does not know how to kick or punch, the DVD set is definitely not worth the price charged. I feel extremely disappointed. Please note that all DVDs are done in this manner, I emailed the seller and they advised me to wait a bit longer for a video to appear.

The next 3 DVDs are OK, I recommend skip the first 3 DVDs and just buy the Hapkido Dynamite DVD set.",1368057600,2,1093,4.180094786729858
