2604713,5,B000GBFR0Q,THIS DVD IS VERY GOOD FOR THE NEW DECORATOR AND DARCI IS A FANTASTIC TEACHER!,1229904000,2,77,4.2
2604714,5,B000GBFR0Q,Darci makes decorating a cake very easy to learn. This is perfect for someone who has no experience and includes helpful tips for people who are just learning or need a refresher course on the basics.,1212278400,5,200,4.583333333333333
2604715,3,B000GBFR0Q,"Im currently taking the Wilton classes (course #2) and I thought this video would make a nice addition to my lessons, as Im a VERY visual learner.

The video isn't bad, it is very viewable.  However I did not find it to be very instructive.  Darci flies thru a few basic methods and then flies thru instructions on how to make the rose.  Not helpful in the least.  However I did learn from her some excellent idea regarding the way to smoothly foundation ice a cake.

If you've never taken a class, this might be a good investment.  I personally find the classes to be a better investment.",1208390400,10,589,4.398148148148148
2604716,5,B000GBFR0Q,"I found this to be one of the top instructional DVD's for a new student.  Yes, her techniques are different but they work, and they are very simple.  I have been decorating for over 11 years and I always aim for perfection.  I also teach cake decorating, and I see how the students struggle with their icing.  Well, this solves the icing on the cake  problem and any other issues with your decorating.  Some of her techniques are different from the traditional ways that I teach my decorating classes, but I will dare to have my 10 year old daughter watch the DVD and use Darci's techniques to decorate a cake.  It's that simple, and her icing works to perfection.
She is fun to watch and the best part is the price.  Happy decorating!
Sincerely,
Emy
For more advance decorator's ""Perfecting the art of Buttercream"" by Sharon Zambito is also a great addition to any collection!  But first master Darci's techniques then move up!",1203379200,23,928,4.609756097560975
2604717,5,B000GBFR0Q,"This video is great! This is a how to video, but I found myself very entertained with Darci's fun attitude. She explains many details for cake decorating, shares wonderful tips, ideas & how to keep it easy!
This video really shows how to get from mixing up the cake batter to having it ready for the party.
I have always enjoyed trying to make birthday cakes for my kids, but have never ever been very good at it. When my kids were younger they really didn't care how it looked (writing all wiggly, the borders looking horrid), but I just never had the time to dedicate going to a cake decorating class.
After watching this video, I felt like I could just get up and make a beautiful cake!
I used the recipe Darci provides, followed her instructions & made a wonderful cake for my son, and yes I made a few mistakes, but the tips that were given REALLY HELPED!!!
When my daughter's birthday came around, I had to watch the video again to freshen up, but made my daughter's cake (I used Darci's Bling-Bling Cake kit too) & my daughter had a hard time believing that I made the cake. That night during her sleep-over, I overheard her tell her friends, she knew I didn't make the cake, and she went into details of how bad my previous cakes looked.
Thank you Darci for helping me make great simple cakes!
I recommend this video to anyone who is looking at learning how to decorate cakes!!!!",1201219200,12,1387,4.400778210116732
2604718,5,B000GBFR0Q,"I was pleased with the instruction. Darci shows you how to  hold the bag to make the designs like shells, roses and borders, how to fill the bag , and most important a frosting recipe that really works. I highly recomend this video.",1180137600,12,232,4.395348837209302
8130506,3,B000GBFR0Q,"Not what i expected for the money. Did have some good information for the beginner, but certainly could have been better. Cakes demonstrated were very simple grocery store bakery style cakes.  Did show how to do borders, roses, icing and other basics. However, i have seen about the same basic information on youtube. The material looked very dated and low budget quality film. Had simple start to finish projects but went through them quickly and would just say things like use tip # 23, but never explained how tips are numbered or things like that. Overall not bad but considering all the free videos on youtube with basically the same info it is not worth the money in my opinion.",1360972800,,684,4.7
8130507,5,B000GBFR0Q,A great video for someone who doesn't know how to decorate a cake using buttercream frosting. Her lessons make it easy and approachable for someone who wants to learn the basics of making a cake look good. I love that she doesn't tell you to go out and buy expensive tools to get started and makes it seem like a very at home project rather than something only a chef could do. Darci is very inspiring.,1327536000,2,402,4.302631578947368
8130508,4,B000GBFR0Q,"I am definitely an absolute beginner and I enjoyed watching this video.  I knew nothing about cake decorating and after watching this video I was excited to go give it a try.  I did notice that this video also comes in a $50 kit with all the tools necessary to get started too.  It can be bought on her website [...].  I had bought some supplies but not all so now I have to buy a few here and there.  A complete kit to get sarted would have been nice.  I'm sure this is over simplified for those have a little experience, but I was happy with the video as a very inexpensive way to get started.  I wish there was a volume 2 to cover things that the over-simplified starter video didn't cover but I didn't even see one on her website.  For now I'm excited to go try what I learned so far and then maybe take a class to expand on the basic skills I've just learned.  I also like that the insert inside the case had the icing recipes and list of tools that acted as a good shopping list to take with me to the store.  I didn't have to pause the tv and write it all down.",1280620800,,1068,3.971830985915493

8130510,2,B000GBFR0Q,This is a very elemental cake decorating presentation with not much going for it. Looked like sloppy work to me. Not at all impressed.,1272326400,,134,4.625
8130511,4,B000GBFR0Q,"Darci does a great job teaching basic cake decorating techniques.  She covers everything from how to bake the cake, to making the perfect icing, to applying the icing, and then shows several decorated cakes.  This is perfect for a beginner. Her bubbly personality only adds to the DVD.",1271462400,2,285,4.916666666666667
8130512,5,B000GBFR0Q,Darcy gives tips on making a marble cake with mixes. She doesn't give instruction on scratch cakes. She gives clear instructions. The background information she gives about equipment is helpful. The video is reasonable quality.,1266451200,2,227,5.514285714285714
8130513,3,B000GBFR0Q,The dvd was fine but i expected a little more indept instruction my fifteen year old a beginner baker loved it so all is not lost.,1265155200,,130,4.038461538461538
8130514,3,B000GBFR0Q,"Darci Decorates Volume 1 is just....okay. I don't know what else to say about it. I learned more about cake decorating on youtube videos. I'm a beginner so I appreciated that she took everything super slow, but sometimes it was TOO SLOW and boring. It's like they didn't have an editing department over at the Darci Decorates office. It sort of dragged on a bit.
She shows you how to make various cakes, but somehow, they all ended up looking the same. She never introduced any new or interesting borders. It was always the shell border. I would have loved to learn more about different variations on more imaginative borders and maybe something other than ALL WHITE icing.
I liked how she shows you how to ""dirty ice"" or do a crumb coat, but when it came to actually icing the cake, sometimes it looked sloppy. The borders she did were sort of sloppy as well. I expected her to have more of clean and elegant approach to writing on cakes like how to space things evenly and how to avoid atrocious empty white spaces or conversely, how to stop writing from looking smushed and crowded.
This video felt like I was sitting in the kitchen with a friend and she was just showing me how to do some simple every day bakery cakes...but not very well. While I do appreciate learning something from someone who isn't absolutely perfect (so that I don't feel so overwhelmed), I felt that I could have learned more from other sources--like when I watch Cake Boss or Ace of Cakes on television.
I may be speaking prematurely and maybe my criticisms are a bit harsh if this is part of a series and there will be some other things introduced in the future.
I just felt that she lacked imagination at some points, HER CAKES LOOKED GENERIC,  and she could have done some things in a less sloppy way.
I know I might be nit picking, but it really bothered me that when she made her rainbow cake, she didn't do the colors in the correct rainbow order. She did red, orange, yellow, green, purple and then blue. Um...last time I checked blue comes after green. Like I said, it's a small thing, but it really bothered me.
Another thing that bothered me were the camera angles. CAMERA MAN, I CAN'T SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING WHEN YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON IT! It wasn't her fault, it was the director's fault, who supposedly is highly acclaimed....really? Wow. Quite interesting.

If you're a total beginner, you might like or hate this video. I can't really say either way. I'm a beginner,but I expected a little bit more from it.

But then again, this is just my opinion.
:)",1264464000,3,2544,4.5021645021645025
8130515,5,B000GBFR0Q,"I really enjoyed this video.  There was alot of good tips.  I am a first time cake decorator.  Looking at books for techniques can refresh your memory, but when you've never done these things it makes it so much easier to actually watch her hands and how she moves them to get the icing to ""work"" for her.  I am looking forward to buying more of her products.  Sincerely  Diana Klunk",1263600000,2,383,4.323943661971831
