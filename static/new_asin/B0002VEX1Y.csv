8032990,5,B0002VEX1Y,The reviews that I read fully disclosing the graininess of this made for tv 1950's production were accurate.  Also accurate was the supposition that it is worth it to see Margot Fonteyn float across the floor.  My 5 year old granddaughter who has completed her introductory year of ballet classes was as captivated as I was.  I will endeavor to find other productions in which Ms. Fonteyn stars.,1466467200,2,395,4.779411764705882
8032991,5,B0002VEX1Y,"This DVD preserves a remarkable slice of ballet history. Fonteyn, Ashton, & McMillan together  and separately are an education in the creation and presentation of characterThe video suffers of course from some of the cumbersome efforts of1950s television production, but that matters not at all in comparison to Fonteyn's magic and the opportunity to see as fairies the flock of then rising dancers who became Royal's principal ballerinas in the years following.",1439942400,2,462,5.416666666666667
8032992,1,B0002VEX1Y,"Expecting a classical rendition of Cinderella, I was more than disappointed when receiving a ""contemporary"" version of Cinderella that was ""animalistic"" and in many cases downright disgusting. I assume the dancers themselves have been classically trained; they are very capable and talented, and execute the moves flawlessly, but I had such a hard time seeing past the crude dancing to really value their artistic merits. This ""ballet"" left me feeling uncomfortable, agitated and empty.",1275782400,4,486,5.581081081081081
8032993,2,B0002VEX1Y,"I teach ballet and plan on doing Cinderella as our show this year, involving children ages 4-20.  I bought this video so that I could show pieces to my classes so they could see how the story is told through movement.  I was very disappointed that I will not be able to do that.  The costumes are inappropriate to show to classes of children because the fairy godmother's costume is completely sheer ALL over.  Also the story line is not that of the classic Cinderella ballet.  None of the seasonal fairies were included.  I still gave it two stars because the choreography and dancing were quite beautiful.  I enjoyed watching it myself, but it isn't appropriate for my purposes.",1259539200,7,680,4.663865546218488
8032994,5,B0002VEX1Y,My granddaughters ballet teacher suggested I get some ballet dvd's since she is such a lovely little ballerina.  She loved both Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and watched them in their entirety.  Its really a beautiful production.,1247097600,3,230,5.361111111111111
8032995,3,B0002VEX1Y,"I took a gamble buying this DVD with little editorial comment provided.  It is a work of true artistic merit, much in the style of 20th century stage drama that Prokofiev may have embraced.  It is modern, perhaps too modern and abstracted for a tale which many would expect to fit a traditional mold (Disney style and such).  There are dance approaches that tend more toward the erotic and create psychodramatic effects that are not sensitive to all audiences.  Trying to turn the tale into some kind of allegorical or primitive emotional display is perhaps a tribute to the spirit of Prokofiev, but not so much to the cultural heritage of the tale.

The presentation is clean, abstract and clever with eccentricities and hyperdramatic energy typified in 20th century dance.  There is great character development appropriate to the spirit of the drama.

The musical performance is in question, because this is not a live presentation.  I believe the ballet was performed with recorded music and studio produced.  Also, the sense of deeper purpose than to entertain an electrified audience runs throughout the performance and in the (detached) styles of the performers.

A contemporary and original concept, but not for the enjoyment of all.",1223769600,19,1240,5.064039408866995
8032996,5,B0002VEX1Y,"The story of Cinderella has its origins in antiquity, but our modern concept of the story is due to Charles Perrault and the Brother's Grimm. It is from the Perrault version that we get the role of the Fairy Godmother and it is from the Grimm version that we find a link between Cinderella's adventures and her mother's spirit(manifested in the form of two birds in the Grimm version). The concept in this ballet combines elements from both versions, and even includes ideas from other versions. The dancing itself is mostly based on classical ballet technique with the usual character elements. For example, all the female roles are danced entirely on pointe with the exception of the dancers in foreign lands and, most notably, Cinderella herself, whose roles are danced barefoot. The other traditional aspect is the presentation of the story itself. We begin with a pas de deux between the father(danced by Roelandt) and his first wife, Cinderella's mother(danced by Coppieters, who also dances the part of the the Fairy). The relationship between the members of the original family is emphasized, which gives this story great emotional depth. It is the love in this family that survives the mother's death and gives the impetus for the adventures to come. There is even a scene at the end, where the father is happy to see his daughter's joyous fate, but then realizes how lonely he is and the spirit of his first wife returns to comfort him. Most of the other aspects of the story are included in their familiar forms. The modern aspects are the sets and costumes. They are quite surreal and impressionistic, but the entire ballet genre could be said to be surreal and impressionistic so this fits just fine. The music is mostly Prokofiev's Cinderella, but some music from other Prokofiev pieces is also used. There are actually two DVDs in this set. One is the performance and the other includes an extensive look into the rehearsals and making of this ballet, as well as a documentary on the life and art of Bernice Coppieters. There are subtitles in English, German, Spanish, and Chinese(most of the discussions are in French).
The dancing is of the highest caliber and the story is presented in one of the most thorough and romantic styles. Don't miss this most amazing and unique version of Cinderella!",1217894400,20,2312,4.855696202531646
8032997,5,B0002VEX1Y,"Margot Fonteyne is ALWAYS wonderful, as are the rest of the characters -- as Salders Wells ALWAYS are!!!!  Worth the time and money and then some.",1216166400,5,146,4.615384615384615
8032998,4,B0002VEX1Y,"I was really pleased to see that a copy of this 1957 TV version

of the Prokofiev/Ashton Cinderella has been released.

I must be honest, though. For me there were pluses as well as minuses associated with this DVD.

First, it's wonderful to see any footage of Margot Fonteyn who was the ballerina that really hooked me into ballet.

Yes, there were dancers with a showier technique than hers, but this shows off her beautiful line, extreme musicality and immense charm.

It's also nice to see her with one of her long time partners,

Michael Somes. I also enjoyed the very brief glimpses of Svetlana Beriosova, a beautiful dancer from the 50s and 60s.

Another plus for me, although others may look at this in a very different way are the cuts. The version of the ballet, as presented in this TV edition, is very heavily cut. Real fans of the piece may find this a drawback, however I find the complete version over long, and padded out with way too much of the step-sisters. Also, and again, this is a very personal view, I find Prokofiev's score a bit unimaginative, and like the choreography, somewhat padded. So I'm fine with the cuts but realize others may not be.

What's left of the stepsisters' scenes is a lot of fun and Ashton and MacMillan have wonderful comic timing .

The most serious problem is the poor quality of the picture. The original must have been in very bad shape. Although at best it is very grainy, at worst, in the Four Seasons section, the contrast is very poor. I would never have been able to recognize the young Merle Park as Spring without the credits.

There is also a slightly under-reheared air about this production.

Still, even with the drawbacks, this is highly enjoyable. I would highly recommend it even with the limitations I noted.",1101513600,38,1776,4.606349206349206
