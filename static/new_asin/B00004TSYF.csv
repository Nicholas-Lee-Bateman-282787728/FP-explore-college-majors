7923114,5,B00004TSYF,"This film tells the story of a Jewish family in the 1930s Hungary, and it's told in a very naturalist, cinema verite style, which gives it an immediacy and a realism. The actors and sets are all very believable, and the child actors are perfect. An instant classic from 1987, which deserves to be on DVD!",1258156800,2,304,4.446428571428571
7923115,5,B00004TSYF,"In light of the subject matter, this film tells a somber story of the Holocaust of WW II mixed in with several humorous interactions between the characters in the movie.
*With the Holocaust looming over them, an elderly Jewish couple with no surviving children decided to adopt an eight-year-old gentile boy to leave their estate to. They want a Christian boy that the Nazis will not exterminate.
*The story starts at the orphanage where they select from among several boys a child that does not want to be adopted. The boy's story goes from resistance to a child-like curiosity about farm life. Rather than learn about the birds and the bees, the child learns it first hand from the rooster and the bull. He spies on a young gentile couple who work on the farm making love and observes that, according to the rooster, they're not doing it right.
*The boy's father enlists the aid of a Swabian friar to give him a Christian education but he also learns about the Jewish spiritual heritage. He also experiences prejudice that the Jews were subjected to. As the story unfolds, the boy forms a tight bond with the couple.
*The inevitable conclusion takes place with the boy placed in care of the young couple.",1210464000,3,1206,4.693396226415095
7923116,5,B00004TSYF,It is an incredible movie. It takes place in Hungary during the last year of World War II and tells a story of family and of the amazing strength that love can be and give.,1143849600,2,172,3.942857142857143
7923117,5,B00004TSYF,"Although this film depicts a time and place in Hungary when the

Germans are approaching to eliminate Jews, one couple -or rather-

one man comes up with an imaginative solution.  He knows that he'

is likely to be eliminated by the Nazis. So he adopts a Christian boy beforehand, offers the youngster love, and teaches him about his heritage.  Only in this way can the father offer a gift to posterity.  This really is a very moving film and the performances are exquisite.",1138838400,7,474,4.650602409638554
7923118,5,B00004TSYF,"To test Job, God took away everything he had, but still Job refused to curse God and die.  ""The Revolt of Job"" (""Jrb lzadsa"") is a 1983 Hungarian film from director Imre Gyongyossy that tells of a Jewish couple (Ferenc Zenthe and Hedy Temessy) whose children have all died and so they adopt a Christian child (Gabor Feher) so they can pass on their heritage.  But of course, even if they do not realize it from the very start, the viewer certainly knows that their hopes are literally going to be turned to ashes.  This is a relatively quiet film, leisurely paced, and filmed against beautiful scenery, all of which serves to heightens the final tragedy.  Even without the dimension of the Holocaust, ""The Revolt of Job"" still tells the compelling story of how the couple and the child learn to love one another.  This only enhances the quality of this film.",987897600,10,858,4.618421052631579
7923119,5,B00004TSYF,"Thank you Amazon!  The re-release of this movie has been a long time coming, but finally someone realized just how good it is.  This story may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the performances are great and sure to move you.  The Jewish population in Hungary was one of the last to be sent by the Nazis to the extermination camps.  An elderly couple (whose children have all died) adopt a young Gentile boy in order to pass along their heritage to a new generation and keep it alive.  How the boy integrates into their family and his new found faith is the heart of this tale.  Although the ending is a foregone conclusion, you are left with a sense of hope nonetheless.  The price listed is more than I usually pay for a video, but for some hard-to-find rarities such as this one, it is well worth it.  Highly recommended!",975542400,14,824,4.375
