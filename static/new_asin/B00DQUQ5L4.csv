8596441,2,B00DQUQ5L4,"Ultra low budget movie. Wooden actors and dialog in a movie that fails to be either titillating or scary. The additional short is mildly amusing, but doesn't add enough to make any of it worthwhile. Save your $6 for something else.",1454976000,2,231,4.658536585365853

8596443,1,B00DQUQ5L4,"The movie has an unimaginative plot, sub par acting, and it cuts out the bite scenes. Meaning, they don't show the victim being bitten,  and their reaction to being bitten. You have to ask yourself then, what's the point of watching a vampire film if you don't see the biting? Leave this one on the shelf unless you want to be disappointed.",1417219200,5,340,4.483870967741935

8596445,3,B00DQUQ5L4,"Imagine your gory flick of ten years ago is released this year,After one of your actresses has passed on and you moved on to other movie themes ?
This happened to all in this SOTV cast/ crew.
Its a good scare and has some moments .
The hero bears more than a passing resemblance to DENNIS FRANZ of NYPD Blue TV and his young partner has  Sins Of The Flesh issues.
George Stover, Always a lucky charm to ANY film production,AS another coroner
Ed Dilley, As Vampire pimp is quite adequate,Seen him in other films,Dude you have the skill set to entertain viewers doing what ever role,Thanks.",1385424000,2,588,4.4953271028037385
8596446,5,B00DQUQ5L4,"I would've never thought that this would happen: I get to write a review of a movie, where I'm all over it!  Yes...it's true.  I'm on-camera!  I'm behind the camera!  I am in the behind-the-scenes stuff!  You get to see me so much!  That alone should make you want to buy this movie.

I know...not listed in the info above.  Trust me...I'm deeply involved!

Now that that's out of the way, let me get to the review:

This film was originally titled ""Blood Seduction"" and was independently released.  It was the fourth full-length release from Dark Fall Productions: the writer-producer-actor-director duo of Doug Ulrich and Al Darago.  As you can read from the product description, they were high-school buddies who reunited in the early nineties and began to make low-budget films.  I joined up with them as they began production on their second film, eventually becoming a co-star alongside of Al.

This comes from the heart from somebody who knows them: these guys are the real deal.  They make their films on a shoe-string budget, enlist their friends and family to act alongside of working actors (who work for food!), and produce their films at a breakneck pace.  Having been on other peoples' sets, I can tell you that one will rarely work with more professional and able filmmakers.

""7 Sins of the Vampire"" was just one stop in Doug and Al's evolution, representing vast improvements in their storytelling and in their visual expertise.  As you learn in the ""Making Of,"" this story began life as a warped idea titled ""Vampire Hookers From Dundalk,"" named as such to honor our beloved town of Dundalk, MD.  (Unfortunate note: the original short is not included on this DVD)  After a few failed attempts to make this into a full-length feature and producing another movie, the Dark Fall guys finally completed their script.  Now, you get to see the results.

All these guys and gals acted their hearts out (some literally!).  Al...Doug...Mark...Rita...Ed...all turned in some noteworthy performances.  You'll also see some established Baltimore actors in the mix: George Stover (of John Waters films) and Vincent DePaul, who seems to pop up in every Hollywood blockbuster that comes out. It's a great hour that'll have you chuckling and mesmerized.

Also included is Mark Mackner's short: an excellent take-off on the silent picture, borrowing from ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".  The trailers are also terrific...I'll won't spoil them for you.

In closing, I want you to know that, not long after this film was finished, Doug, Al and I lost a beloved member of our cast.  The late, great Anastasia Summers was a joy, bringing elegance and class to every job she did.  She shines in ""7 Sins,"" and she will never be forgotten...especially by ""John 1"".",1373587200,5,2757,4.906926406926407
