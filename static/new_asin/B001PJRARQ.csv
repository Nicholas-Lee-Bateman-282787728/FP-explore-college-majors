3747398,5,B001PJRARQ,"I watched the abbreviated version of the 2009 Itidarod on TV, but I wanted a more complete / comprehensive version.  I searched the web for a 2009 video.  I found this video on Amazon, which appeared to be a video of the 2009 race ... but it wasn't.  I was initially disappointed that this was not the 2009 race, but in fact the 2008 race.  I watched it anyway.  The video and commentary is excellent.  I learned facts about the race that I didn't know.  While I'm disappointed that Amazon didn't make it more obvious that the video is of the 2008 race released in 2009, this Discovery Channel video of the 2008 race is EXCELLENT.  I hope that Discovery will also release a vide of the 2009 race, which I will happily purchase.",1242518400,29,727,4.373134328358209
3747399,1,B001PJRARQ,"Movie production is beautiful, and quite accurate, EXCEPT:
The movie focused on a diabetic racer who had problems running the race.
The movie totally ignored that there was a blind girl
running the race,  AND  she completed the race in Nome.",1241740800,9,241,4.853658536585366

3747409,5,B001PJRARQ,"Great human interest documentary.  The people (men and women) and the animals have tremendous nobility while fighting the elements and terrain.  The setting is SPECTACULAR.  Very gripping and dramatic true story.  If you like nature, human courage and animals - dogs - this story will inspire you.  Highly recommended.",1407283200,,318,5.408163265306122
3747410,5,B001PJRARQ,Very good choice for anyone with interest in the Iditarod race.,1406937600,,63,4.818181818181818
3747411,5,B001PJRARQ,My grandson was interested in the Iditarod so I purchase it for him and he is enjoying it.  Very educational!,1400630400,,109,4.45
3747416,5,B001PJRARQ,Great perspective of the Iditarod. I used this to build background knowledge in my classroom as we studied the Iditarod. My students were cheering for the names that they recognized in the video.,1399334400,,195,4.9393939393939394
3747417,5,B001PJRARQ,"Fast delivery and a great documentary on the iditarod in Alaska. Packaging was great as well. The price was good, it came with an extra dvd about climate warming as well.",1397692800,,170,4.516129032258065
3747418,3,B001PJRARQ,It takes some real neves to do what these people do. A good team of dogs seams to help as well.,1392681600,,95,3.5714285714285716
3747419,4,B001PJRARQ,"Pretty good documentary of the race, obviously edited a little more on the dramatic side for television purposes but overall nicely done.",1392508800,,137,5.2727272727272725
3747420,5,B001PJRARQ,"I binge watched this show in one weekend when it was still on Netflix streaming, then bought the DVD as a gift for my parents. The explanations of seemingly minor facets of the race/race planning are fascinating, and show itself doesn't reek of manufactured drama the way some Discovery reality shows tend to (looking at you, Moonshiners). Definitely worth a watch.",1392249600,,365,5.0
3747421,3,B001PJRARQ,"I've been to Alaska and took a tour on Jeff Kings operation. He kept us well informed for 2 hours. Best money we spent. Even got to hold the puppies. AWE. He is a 4 time winner of the race and its interesting to hear some of the things that go on during the race. They are a rare breed and tough. So you might enjoy the video, plus you get to see some beautiful scenery. It's worth your time to check it out.",1392249600,,408,3.869047619047619
3747422,5,B001PJRARQ,"I've always been interested in the Iditarod race.  I sent my husband & oldest son on a sled ""trip"" with a Iditarod racer that operates a sled tour company here in Michigan - that got them hooked on learning more about the dogs, the racers & the history of the race in general.  This video was great hands on video through the race - both the physical & the mental parts.  I hope they do this with other race years events - I would definitely want to see it!",1390953600,,457,4.112359550561798
3747423,5,B001PJRARQ,"This Documentary was so well done.  We are former dog drivers so, to see the inside of what was happening was just great.",1389916800,,121,4.260869565217392
3747424,5,B001PJRARQ,a client of mine went to the iditarod and i got it for her...she loved it! I watched a small bit of it.,1385424000,,103,3.5217391304347827
3747425,5,B001PJRARQ,I hope there are more of these shows upcoming. You really get an idea of what the dogs and the humans go through in this legendary race. The show picks several race teams and follows them from day 1 to the end. We learned a lot about the race.,1385078400,,243,3.979591836734694
3747446,5,B001PJRARQ,Iditarot is a great documentary that provides a good insight into the dog sledge race that happens in Alaska. It also provides insighr into Alaska's wilderness and tough conditions. I loved it!,1383264000,,193,5.0625
3747447,5,B001PJRARQ,"I really appreciate having a series that we can watch together as a family, and this is one of them.  Often series will have offensive scenes and dialogue which I feel is not appropriate for our children (ages 1 and up).  As a plus, this helped spark conversation about the first iditarod race which helped our children learn a little more about history.  I felt it was not too slow moving as it followed some key racers throughout the series to the end of the race.  The only drawback is that it is only 6 episodes long, however that is probably why the series didn't get monotonous.",1380758400,,584,4.429906542056075
3747448,4,B001PJRARQ,Very interesting and entertaining. Not as good as other similar shows like Everest though. It's worth the watch since there's only like 8 episodes.,1379203200,,147,5.166666666666667
3747449,5,B001PJRARQ,i used to live in alaska 15 years ago and this show brings back alot of memories from growing up and following this raise yearly.  great watch i wish they had more seasons of this!,1377561600,,180,4.142857142857143
3747450,5,B001PJRARQ,"If you like the ruggedness of Alaska and the tenacity of the people who9 live there, then this is an excellent series.",1375142400,,118,4.409090909090909
3747451,2,B001PJRARQ,I thought I would like this show but it was boring and lacked excitement. I can't imagine watching an entire season of it.,1371686400,,122,4.3478260869565215
3747452,4,B001PJRARQ,My daughter watched the whole season back to back; very engaging. Video quality could be better. We've been to the iditarod headquarters.,1371340800,,137,5.2727272727272725

3747454,5,B001PJRARQ,Iditarod was a great look at the 2008 race and covers a variety of competitiors. Discovery goes a good job showing the history and science behind the amazing runs these dogs put together. Still revelant in 2013 because most of the top competitors are racing this year who were featured in the show,1368489600,,297,4.622641509433962
3747455,5,B001PJRARQ,This was one great series. Loved every minute of it. Was like I was there. Thanks for this awesome show.,1368489600,,104,4.25
3747466,5,B001PJRARQ,I can only imagine what this run must actually be like!  These are some amazing people!!  I am SO pleased I could be an arm chair participant in this particular race.  It was absolutely amazing and what great entertainment!  I loved the rapport between the mushers and their animals.  Tell Discovery to do it again!!  Some of the folks featured in the film are STILL running the race!!  Amazing!!,1367884800,,396,4.6521739130434785
3747467,5,B001PJRARQ,My kid learned about this race in school. It was a great mom and me moment to watch this. Go dogs go!,1367107200,,101,3.6363636363636362
3747468,4,B001PJRARQ,Interesting especially if you don't know anything about the race.  Great family series to watch especially if you have dog lovers!,1366761600,,130,5.190476190476191
3747469,5,B001PJRARQ,"The courage to race in this event after overcoming some of life's hardest challenges of cancer, diabeties, alcohol and financial hardships was inspiring. The drive to finish the race through injuries, varying weather conditions, mental & physical fatigue as well as the challenging Alaska terrain was motivating. The love of the dog teams, the support of the families and communities as well as the traditional meaning for the race was captured well by the series. Mush On!",1365811200,,473,5.1558441558441555
3747470,5,B001PJRARQ,It doesn't take long before you become aware of the tremendous strength and endurance necessary to complete this race. Imagine 1000 miles in about 9 days!  There are racers that you love to cheer for and racers you love to hate.  Then there are the dogs.  These are amazing creatures.  I watched one episode per day to kind of get the feel of the event.  I loved every minute of it.,1365465600,,382,4.323943661971831
3747471,5,B001PJRARQ,This show is awesome. If you want to learn about the famous running of the Iditarod Trail than by all means watch this program. I only wish Discovery could have done more seasons.,1365465600,,179,4.454545454545454
3747472,4,B001PJRARQ,I had no idea that the iditarod had so many people involved. I really enjoyed watching this and the struggles that people have to overcome along the way.,1363824000,,153,4.5
3747473,5,B001PJRARQ,"I love watching the Iditarod, have for many years. I really wish I could buy more videos for this wonderful race. The title says it all ""Iditarod Toughest Race On Earth"". This is so well done and wish they made movies of all of the Iditarod Races. The Mushers and their Teams of extraordinary dogs make this very exciting. This video also shows the beautiful and sometimes deadly landscape of the great state of Alaska. The only reason I say deadly is all of the trials these teams go through to make it to the finish line 1100 miles from the start.",1363737600,,549,4.392156862745098
3747474,5,B001PJRARQ,"It is very interesting and educational. I enjoyed getting to watch the great mushers of the iditarod and learning the strategies the go into winning the iditarod. And of course, the dogs are beautiful to watch:)",1362787200,,211,4.888888888888889
3747475,4,B001PJRARQ,"The DVD looks to be brand new, but it skipped toward the end a few times. Not sure why? Great movie!!!!",1361836800,,103,3.9523809523809526
3747486,5,B001PJRARQ,"Really takes the race, the dogs, the people to a new level of understanding this magnificent feat. The dogs are the center of this film and the people their mothers and coaches. Enjoyable night at the movies. Get the popcorn !",1356652800,,226,4.536585365853658
3747487,5,B001PJRARQ,"My husband and I decided to give this short series a go when we found it on Netflix. It made an Iditarod fan for LIFE out of me!!! What a wonderful example of the partnership between mushers and their dogs. Those dogs love to run and their human partners care as lovingly for them as they would their own children. They are truly a team. The drama of such a grueling race is intoxicating to watch. The rivalry of world class mushers Lance Mackey and Jeff King will pull you in. You will cheer for DeeDee Jonrowe, a breast cancer survivor with an iron will and a passion for the Iditarod. The father/son relationship between Martin Buser and his youngest son Rohn as he races his first Iditarod is heartwarming. This is exceptional television. Truly. I wish that Discovery would film the Iditarod every year. Sadly the race does not get the international Sports world media attention it deserves. Since first seeing this series it has become an annual thing for me to watch the series before Iditarod madness begins in March!! Almost all of the featured mushers in this series are already on the roster for Iditarod 2013. Watch it. You won't be sorry.",1355097600,2,1150,4.614634146341463
3747488,5,B001PJRARQ,"My wife and I watched this on Netflix and then ordered our own copy from Amazon.com. Our copy included some bonus material, also from the Discovery Channel which we greatly appreciated as well. Having attended one Iditarod race in the '90s when we lived in Alaska for a year on a fishing trip, I would recommend this race to anyone interested. It's worth flying in from even as much as 6,000 miles away just to share in this experience. The Alaskan culture, guts and grit are unsurpassed.",1351555200,,488,4.620689655172414
3747489,5,B001PJRARQ,"I have been an Iditarod Insider for several years. I am glued to my computer and watch all the details and data and predict who will reach where and at what time I expect the arrivals. I remember 2008's race but this video brought it all together. It's broken down into parts so you can skip to certain parts and replay as you want. It gives great videos of the actual trail w/ the mushers so you get a real taste of how difficult, beautiful, wild, peaceful, and challenging this adventure can be. I want a compilation of every year like this! As for Jeff King and Lance...Lance made a strategic move and it's all part of the race and strategy. DO WHAT YOU CAN W/O CHEATING AND SABOTAGING! Lance sacrificed sleep and his team was willing so it's all fair. If you like the Iditarod, you'll love this video!",1330819200,2,805,4.373333333333333
3747490,5,B001PJRARQ,"I love this series and am glad I bought it. It shows what it takes to go through the Iditarod experience. Anyone interested in dog sports, Alaska, pure athleticism and the qualities of team work, preparedness, focus, drive, persistance, self-assurance, trust, patience and transparency in action, this series will take you there.",1314748800,4,329,5.346153846153846
3747491,5,B001PJRARQ,"The only bad thing about this is that it's short. I wish it had been ten episodes!

My husband and I watched this together, spread out over three nights. When we watched the first episode we both thought, ""Huh, oddly interesting, I guess we should continue?"" so we did.  Well, then we each picked our favorite musher and it got way more interesting. I tell you, if you love racing, you are going to looooove this. Actually, I don't watch racing, but this has the same draws. You learn the background of each racer. You learn a bit about their dogs, the way they train, the food they give them and why.  You get to hear about the mental toll this race takes on them and what they do to come in ahead of the others.

It's exciting, it's real, it's got dogs, Alaska and competition in snow! With sleds! What else could you want??!

The series starts right off, not much prep, but the preparations are gone into throughout the series.  The racers experience weather issues, dog injuries, dumping their sleds on this crazy turn/drop. The only thing missing is I'd like even more background about the racers, their families, and to see more issues, like the mental toll and the financial costs etc.  I'm surprised the winner only gets $69k and a truck..and a buckle. These folks really put their whole lives into their dogs and the Iditarod. To be sure, it really is the toughest race on earth.

I'd recommend this for any age. There is no s*x or violence. Everyone loves their dogs, so no issues there. It might even make your kids love their dogs even more! There is a little cursing, but overall I think this would be a super fun series for the whole family to watch together!!",1304985600,6,1674,4.465573770491804
3747492,5,B001PJRARQ,"I've had a passing interest in the race after reading about how it got started.  I was perusing material and chanced upon this, so I ordered it.

I asked my wife if she wanted to watch it with me, she said it sounded boring, so she passed.  I started watching it, and lo and behold, my wife walked by, and sat on the floor just to watch a few minutes.  She got hooked, and we watched the whole thing together.

This is a big production.  The filmmakers use night-vision, sled cams, dog cams, and helmet cams.  They also use helicopters, trucks, and other dog teams to get the shots they want.

2008 was marked by a very close race, and the contest wasn't decided until the last hours of the race.  The tension throughout was palpable.  There are many interviews, stories about the dogs, and examinations of snow, equipment, food, and tactics.

This is a very enjoyable program that will hold your interest throughout.  I wish they had examined more of these races; I enjoyed it enough to want to see more.  Superior filmmaking; recommended.",1302998400,,1040,4.556756756756757
3747493,5,B001PJRARQ,"I truly enjoyed this series when it was on TV, and enjoyed it even more the second time, now that I own it. I've become an Iditarod fan and watch this excellent tale of 8 or so of the Iditarod team mushers during the 2008 season with great interest. The detail and indepth video is better than that offered an Iditarod Insider during the race in 2010. The information is still relevant and important for any mushing fan.",1271116800,3,420,4.397435897435898
3747494,4,B001PJRARQ,"I ordered this video after reading Gary Paulsen's (?) book, Winterdance.  It was like two views of a stereoscopic picture.  Winterdance gives you a real sense of the risk and foolhardiness of dog-sledding...and what the passion of it is.  'Iditarod' gives you a close up view of the people who are sold out to it...and not just the race, but the lifestyle.  I go on Iditarod websites now, and read the roster of mushers and I feel like I know a lot of them.  I'm asking myself, ""I wonder what Lance will pull this year?  Does Jeff King still have enough to stay at the front?  Is Darin going back out there?""  These are people I know now, and I'm cheering for the home team.
  Give yourself a bit of adventure and buy this movie.  Everytime, I need an outdoor fix, and can't get away for a hike, I pull out this video.  It's not the same as being on the trail...but like most of the people out there...who knows where you'll wind up.
  I may have passed my prime to actually run the Iditarod, but I'd love to join one of the trail teams or support teams that make the Iditarod possible.  Open yourself up to a world where the Spirit of Alaska still runs free!",1264032000,15,1159,4.276497695852535

8333401,5,B001PJRARQ,"In my first year of living in Alaska someone asked me, ""are you going to watch the Iditarod?"". My response was ""what's an Iditarod?"". Since that time in the late 80's I have been an ardent fan of the sport!  To watch these mushers and dogs not just survive but flourish on a 1,000 mile journey through some of the toughest terrain on earth is electrifying! Might be boring to some but when you get to know many of the mushers and their history it comes to life. Lance Mackey has always been my favorite and then to watch him win 4 in a row was the best! To this day I still hope he can continue to race; love seeing him right in the middle of it all. Martin Buser, DeeDee Jonrowe, Rick Swenson, Susan Butcher, Lance and Dick Mackey to name just a few who have stood the test of time. Toughest race on earth? Yup.",1504051200,,812,4.139240506329114
