Having two people, one male, one female, alternating speaking words / phrases.",1438992000,,260,4.8
8110468,3,B000EHPXMO,"The dvd is great for beginners who want to review the Japanese language , and refresh your memory on the language. It been sometime I have taken Japanese and I found it helpful.",1192060800,,177,4.393939393939394
8110469,1,B000EHPXMO,"This is a  pared down version, and the DVD is full of ads for the full version. There are no comprehensible instructions, and the lessons are confusing. I just went in loops, with the same words being thrown at me over and over and then warnings that I had not completed the full lesson. One module said there were 16 words, but in a half hour I could only make four come up. Whew!",1188000000,2,381,4.148648648648648
8110470,3,B000EHPXMO,Product came prompted but didn't receive a phrasebook as stated on the dvd.  Which was kind of a bummer.,1162512000,,104,4.473684210526316
8110471,5,B000EHPXMO,"This DVD has phrases which are broken into five sections: greetings, directions, dining, shopping, and safety.  I thought people would be shown using the phrases in various situations, but it was recorded in a studio.  After they say a phrase, the written English and Japanese appears (one in kanji/hiragana/katakana and the other in romanji).

As a beginner, I'm finding this DVD very helpful since the written and spoken versions of sentences appear together. (I wish the Pimsleur language program came with written material.)",1157328000,11,528,5.337349397590361
