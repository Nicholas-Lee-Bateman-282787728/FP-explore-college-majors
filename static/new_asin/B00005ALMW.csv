1414054,5,B00005ALMW,"I think that the martial arts genre is one of the best out there. I also feel bad for the people who don't think so, because THIS is entertainment.
The fighting in this movie is so ""fast and furious""....(Hint, hint, America. Stop watching the Bull****. Ya tasteless boring people!!  This is REAL entertainment.) You'll enjoy it very much.  Sammo Hung is great people, take my advice.
Leung(leading role)knew nothing of kung fu before this movie...Absolutely incredible, this guy looks like a supreme fighter(although Yuen Biao is Leung's double for the acrobatic moves).  Sammo trained him when he lived next door to Leung in Hong Kong. Sammo stated that as soon as you'd teach him something, he picked up on it much faster than any other student would.
This movie has a pretty good plot with some twists, a couple slow spots, but in the end: Highly Recommended. The commentary on this DVD is very informative and interesting as well. You'll get that from every Ric Meyers commentary. This is not Sammo's best production but GET IT!  Others that kick a** are:  ""Odd couple"", ""Dirty Tiger, Crazy Frog"", ""Prodigal Son""(My favorite Sammo flick), and ""Eastern Condors"". Enjoy!....Peace.",1070755200,3,1182,5.010204081632653
1414055,4,B00005ALMW,"Sammo Hung and Ka-Yan Leung team up tofight Ka-Yan's evil big brother (complete with eye patch).  Well, team up is maybe the wrong way to put it -- Sammo becomes Ka-Yan's student but Ka-Yan doesn't accept him, in fact he wants to kill him.  This film has pretty decent plot of revenge with a few twists.
The choreography is incredible, as Sammo's work usually is.  There is plenty of action, acrobatics, and yes, some fighting.  OK, plenty of fighting!  The camera work was good too -- nice long shots during fights.
As an added bonus, you get to see Sammo dress up as Dracula.  Not a typical hopping vampire, but real Dracula with crosses, garlic, fake teeth, the works!
The video quality was so-so.  On the plus side, this was wide screen & anamorphic.  On the minus side, there were a lot of little glitches, probably from the original film.  Sound was dubbed and seemed very loud.",1008374400,8,884,4.579617834394904
1414056,5,B00005ALMW,"Is that enough in the title? The choreography of this film, along with a tight screenplay, moving characters, plot twists, comedy, did I mention choreography? This is simply the best martial arts film ever made. Sammo should get more credit, because he's come out with AWESOME films and has yet to make his mark on mainstream America (Martial Law doesn't count, ""TV chews up genius"" <James Coburn>)Maybe with Soul Caliber, which he is directing, will put him over the top (if they do it right, meaning, let him handle ALL of the action sequences, from planning to camera work) Enough, I can't say enough about this film. I've had it since 1983, and I still watch it. The only film I've seen more is Enter the Dragon, and that's only because it was out longer. The Victim is by far the best martial arts film ever made, bar none.",992908800,4,828,4.563758389261745
1414057,5,B00005ALMW,"Starring: Sammo Hung, Leung Ka Yan, and Chang Yi-circa 1980)
This movie has plot, light comedy and over the top fighting. Sammo Hung directed this movie, It was one of his first directing projects. He plays what seems to be a man in search of someone to teach him kung fu, but in reality he's all about something more sinister. I won't give it up, but he finds Leung Ka Yan and  Sammo begs Ka Yan to be his teacher. The underlying plot begins to unfold as Ka Yan's evil brother played by Chang Yi comes into play. This movie has good plot twists and great kung fu action. One of the best Ka Yan displays as Sammo truly worked him out in this movie.
Remember, Leung Ka Yan is not even a true Martial Artist but he kicks some major behind section. I can not say more about this movie. GO GET THIS!!",990576000,2,796,4.1688311688311686

7935482,5,B00005ALMW,I have been watching and collecting kung fu movies for a while now. This movie has the best fight sequence I have ever seen which is the final battle or end fight.,1326758400,,163,4.125
7935483,4,B00005ALMW,"A Hung Kam-Bo choreographed fight is a beautiful thing. This early example, in which he directs and co-stars as well, is definitely a cut above the average martial arts film of the era; a bit more attention to story and character than usual plus, again, those astonishing martial dances.",1326240000,,287,4.877551020408164

7935485,5,B00005ALMW,"This film by Sammo Hung is truely a 5 star classic Leung Ka Yan has two great fight scenes in this film one with Wilson Tung and the final battle with Chang Yi is unbelieveable. Not to mention a good story about love and hate,all the performances here are great.",1214352000,,262,4.26
7935486,4,B00005ALMW,"Sammo Hung directs, choreographs, and stars as Chan Wing, a student looking for the ultimate teacher:  One who can beat him in a fair fight.  He wallops a few potentials, then meets his desired prospect in Chun Yau (Leung Kar Yan) who, as per usual, wants nothing to do with him.  After some goofy attempts at trying to dodge the persistent lad, the master learns that the people he and his wife have been hiding from, have discovered his whereabouts.  Chan Wing offers to help, but his request is again denied.  He follows the master anyway, and the wife soon tells him about all the family drama that has kept them so mobile.  Eventually the master accepts him (after tragedy strikes) and the final cards are dealt... and someone's bluffing.

Though worthy of some criticism, this is a great flick.  Plenty of fights, and ALL of them good.  No waiting for the last 20 minutes to see some decent action, it's right from the get-go.  I usually complain about the sense of humor in Sammo's older films, and there's some rather silly things that I could have done without (the ""vampire"" scene), but most of the comedy is brief and some of it is actually funny.  I can easily overlook a little lame humor when it's punctuated with fight scenes like these.

This version from Martial Arts Theater is full-screened and English-dubbed only.  It has a selection for Cantonese, but it doesn't work.  The picture quality is quite good, but one has to wonder why 20th Century Fox didn't remaster (and redistribute) this, like so many other Sammo titles from this period.  Of the films I've seen that Sammo has directed, this is a close 2nd to ""The Prodigal Son"".  This would be a great starting point for those who love kung fu, but are skeptical of comedies, and Sammo Hung comedies in particular.  The film's only special feature is commentary by Ric Meyers and Bobby Samuels.  I didn't listen to it, but I hope they mention what an amazing performance Leung Kar Yan gives and that it's worth the price of admission... cuz it is.  RECOMMENDED.

7935487,5,B00005ALMW,"I currently own over 220 Shaw Brother films made from 1975 to 1981, while Sammo Hung is not your classic action hero considering his non-athletic appearance.  I never stop being amazed at what he is able to do athletically.  I'm not a big fan of so called class clown kung fu flicks, that's why I've never really migrated over to films with Jacky Chan.  But for some reason, Sammo Hung's comedy never out-weighs his true martial art skills.  This film is a classic and a must have for any entry level or dedicated collector of martial art films.",1200960000,,545,4.530612244897959
7935488,4,B00005ALMW,"A very good Sammo's film, clearly one of the best he directed and choregraphed in the late 70's (with ""Warriors two""). Great martial performance by the effortless charismatic Leung Kar-yan (who's supposed not to be a true martial artist !). Many of the themes were developped in Sammo's later films such as ""Pedicab driver"" (the story of Leung Kar-yan's wife has similarities with the charater of Fennie Yuen).
""The victim"" of the title is not the one we expected.",1189382400,2,464,4.886075949367089
7935489,5,B00005ALMW,"The ""Victim,,this flick has to be one of the best, and well choreographed movie with Leung Kar Yan,,,he performed stellarly.  The movie in it's entirety is well worth what ever the cost.  I must admit,,,I went out to purchased this flick based on the hype right here on amazon,,,and I am happy with that decission.  The fight scenes are AMAZING,,the old school kung fu,,emmensely wicked.  Trust me,,this is must have, rest assured you will not walk away disspointed with your decission to get this flick!!",1151712000,2,505,4.905882352941177
