7896331,4,6305845670,"Above average crime drama from Ringo Lam.  Can't really be considered an action, though the ending is a lot better than what leads up to it.

Beware.  The cover shows Sean Lau holding a Desert Eagle.  By the way, he never does touch a Desert Eagle.  Only his Rossi .38 special.  So the cover is deceptive, and it's a shame they relied on non-cunning deception to get viewers, or at least me, to watch it.  Not only does he not touch the Eagle, non of the actors/actresses touch Eagles.  The truth is, nobody in the movie comes within a mile of anything made by IMI.

Getting back to the movie.  The new remastered version is the way to go.  Near perfect transfer.  Easily the best remastered release by Mei Ah that I've seen.  And I haven't seen very many.

Peter Kam composed the music.  Good music, but Kam does top-notch stuff, so this soundtrack is a bit disappointing.  Still better than Mark Lui.

A lot more serious than Big Bullet, but somewhat similar movies, however the overall style and tone is different.  Not as entertaining as Big Bullet though.

They tried to get us on the cover, but we're too smart.  Sean Lau has a big mouth, but a small gun.",1098921600,2,1161,4.412322274881516
7896332,5,6305845670,"I highly recommend this breathtaking thriller to anybody who enjoy Hong Kong or Asian cinema. I am a eclectic movie fanatics, however, I am not a big fan of Hong Kong movies as their quality has been going down slope since the late 90s, though I am myself a Chinese. A recent thriller-Inferno Affairs received international acclaim and box office alike, while I do not enjoy as much as the hype, forsaken the hk's flair for action, in exchange for the pretentious, self-delusive and pseudo-intelligent melodrama. To me, 'full alert', this low-budget thriller is far better than the over-stylish and dramatic Inferno Affairs, which masterful portrayed a meticulous and non-one-dimensional heist right from the pivotal middle part to the end in tandem with unfolding the background of the story and characters, with a graceful flair in rhythms and storystelling. The story itself is breathtaking and twisty yet believable, with the psychological suspense between the protagonists in the movie. The performance of the two protagonists are mesmerizing, both on the v. top of their game. Personally thinking there is no any Hollywood flicks could top this intelligent, electrifying psycho-thriller, in fact, it could say to be levelled 'heat', intellectually, the comparables may be 'spy game' and 'usual suspect', while they both find actions wanting. I know its not a v. wide known movie, if u ar fortunate enuf to hv bumped into this, u hv to see it.",1081900800,2,1448,5.113924050632911
7896333,4,6305845670,"Ringo Lam 's Full Alert is the kind of edge of your seat, modestly budgeted but utterly action-packed film, U.S. film-makers seem unable to make.
Lam's, City on Fire was the primary source of inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.  While Lam doesn't quite deliver either the slickness or filmmaking chutzpah of John Woo, he remains one of the most consistent quality Hong Kong action filmmakers.  He's best with films that mix action and noir.  His best Hong Kong films are dark, sometimes brutally so with action scenes that are messy and chaotic and not choreographed like dance numbers.  Lam's attempt to follow in Woo's footsteps by directing two Jean Claude Van Damme films wasn't successful.  Maximum Risk in particular was garbage that only briefly hinted at Lam's talents.
With Full Alert, Lam delivers one of the best Hong Kong films ever made.  Full Alert uses several Hong Kong action film cliches (black and white rain soaked flashbacks- males on opposite sides of the law bonding), but gives us full dimensional characters, a good script, superb pacing, one of the best car chases you'll ever see and some genuine suspense which is rare in H.K. actioners.
Lau Ching Wan plays a nearly burnt out dedicated cop named Pao (and reminded me a great deal of Benicio Del Toro) who makes it his personal mission to stop ex-demolition expert, now bad guy named Mak Kwan (Francis Ng) from pulling off a planned big heist.
After inspector Pao arrests Mak for the murder of an architect, he gets Mak to confess to manslaughter but he won't talk about what heist he is masterminding.  Mak is working with
some criminals from Taiwan.  Pao is sure there is a plan to break Mak out of prison and he puts what seems like the entire Hong Kong police force on Full Alert.  Will Mak break out?  What kind of double/triple cross will take place?  What heist is planned?  Will the gang succeed with their heist plans?  Will Mak make one last big score and disappear with his girlfriend?
The film is full of surprising derivations on the cat and mouse formula. There are some rather low-key moments in the film, which contrast nicely to the expected over-the-top stuff, which never get too ridiculous (well until the end, anyway).  Lam doesn't stage his action scenes like choreographed dancing routines and doesn't rely on too many flashy fast edits.  The film is involving and creates some real moments of genuine tension and suspense.  The film never feels like its cheating or over-selling any of its key action scenes.
While it's plots synopsis may make it seem like dozens of other films, I assure you the film contains several sequences which contain surprising moments within them making even some of the most familiar parts of the film worth seeing. It's also a film that you'll remember for more than a few days.
Lau who has given some pretty poor performances in some films is excellent throughout the film.  Ng's performance is perhaps a little too laid back and he isn't playing the kind of over-colorful villain one often encounters in H.K. films.  Lam I'm sure wanted this... since he's certainly capable of giving us an over-the top villain  (Danny Lee in City on Fire for instance).  This makes the film work better because you don't know what to expect from Mak... we aren't sure what he is capable of, how far he is willing to go or what to expect.  A more colorful and broader played villain would be expected to deliver one outrageous thing after another. Here we can be genuinely surprised by what he does and doesn't do.
The quality of most H.K. films on Tai Seng are a big step down from U.S. studio DVDs but a good print with only a few scratches and visible grain was used here.  The colors lack the crispness and brightness DVD transfers often have and the black levels are not as high as they should be which means you lose a lot of detail in darker scenes.  Sound wise the film is acceptable but little if any imaginative mixing was utilized.
Subtitles are for the most part easy to read.  A few times the subs are over light backgrounds and difficult to read and a few times they flash much too quickly on and off screen.  However,  as in so many VHS H.K. films they aren't cropped outside of the frame making them incomplete or impossible to read.  The film's dialogue is important but it isn't a talky film.
BOTTOM LINE:
One of the best car chases you'll ever see occurs a little past the half-way point of this fine action/caper/gangster film from veteran Hong Kong director Ringo Lam who loves delivering car chases.  The action is not only excellent and quite exciting but there is also a much higher level of suspense than usual for a Hong Kong film.  The script and characterizations are among the best of any Hong Kong film.  It's got parts of both Heat and A Better Tomorrow in it, but doesn't copycat those films.  This is among Lam's finest and ranks up there with the best Hong Kong films of the late 80's and early 90's.  Don't miss this one.

7896334,4,6305845670,"The discovery of a dead body leads cop Lau Ching-Wan to believe Francis Ng is going to attempt a major theft.  Director Ringo Lam is on solid, familiar ground here with this police procedural/character analysis.  Lau  is his usual excellent self while Ng is more reserved (though he still is  simmering beneath the surface).  Lam somehow manages to show the  similarities between the cop and the thief without violating the integrity  of the cop or making a hero of a crook.  Recommended.",957916800,4,488,4.865853658536586
7896335,5,6305845670,"This is the best film I have seen from Ringo Lam to date.  It takes its inpiration from Michael Mann's ""Heat"" but takes a more serious approach to the issues raised briefly in that film.  The main point here is  that once a person kills another, s/he can never regain innocence.  It  doesn't matter whether or not the killing was justified.  In any case, it's  murder.  The only difference between the cop and the robber in this film is  that they are on different sides of the law -- neither is  ""better"" than the other.
The film is different from most action  movies you will see, in that it is very realistic.  Nothing about it is  stylized or glamorized.  There isn't much action, and the action sequences  are subdued (although te car chase is quite extraordinary).  The focus is  on the characters' psychological states.  The most unique thing is that  unlike all other movies that I have ever seen, this film focuses on the  consequences of taking another person's life that the person who commits  the act suffers.
MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",956793600,6,1047,4.6740331491712706
