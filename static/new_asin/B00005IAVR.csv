1426039,5,B00005IAVR,"This might well be one of the very best music DVDs you'll ever feast eyes on.  It is definitely worth the price at any price!  Mario Frangoulis' enthusiasm and his love for singing is so genuine, heartfelt, passionate and contagious, that you'll find it impossible to feel down while watching/listening to this recording.  Excellent selection of songs performed in a beautiful outdoor theater.  And with the English subtitles, you'll find yourself reading in one language, listening to and singing along in another language and also taking in a visual treat of Mario's onstage presence all in one effortless, natural motion.  Quite a lot of fun!  If there is any downside to this DVD it's that it isn't long enough -- I would have enjoyed hearing much more of the concert and seeing a lot more bonus features.  Hopefully there will be more on his next video....and there will be another, I'm sure of that, given this man's tremendous talent!",1041552000,7,941,4.880503144654088
1426040,5,B00005IAVR,"Mario is amazing.  I am a die hard Bocelli, Groban, Safina fan but I am afraid Mario is a step above all three.  The audio is superb, the subtitles a major treat, and Mario sings his heart out with pipes that have to be heard to be believed.  He has trained with Alfredo Kraus, famous operatic tenor, has won the Maria Callas vocal prize for opera and does crossover like no other. This is passionate singing, singing with all the emotions, ranging from sensitive to powerful, from happy to sad, no monotone depressing tones here!!  Hijjo de Luna a song I am familiar with from Sarah Brightman's DVD who turns it into just another  pretty  song.  It is transformed by Mario into a story of mythological and operatic proportions by the range of expression Mario puts into it along with the subtitles (of course it is in Greek and since Greek is his native language he knows what he is singing about).  The whole DVD is absolutely fantastic and highly recommended to anyone who loves crossover.  Too bad PBS won't be showing this as often as Josh's concert (don't get me wrong I really like Josh he has a very nice voice and is very likeable) but it is interesting to see how the American boy gets all the publicity whereas the European talents with the exception of Bocelli don't get the same level of publicity.",1041292800,8,1311,4.521186440677966
1426041,5,B00005IAVR,"I am crossing all fingers and toes in the hope that this amazingly talented young man will receive the recognition that he so deserves.  Sometimes I Dream:Live In Concert was filmed in Thessaloniki, Greece at the beautiful Theatre of the Earth.  Mario is joined by a lovely orchestra and a couple of different choirs.  The audience is made up of all ages, from teenagers to young couples to senior citizens. This is singing at its purist - no overblown pyrotechnics or crazy lighting, no dancers, no smoke.  It is a man on a stage, singing with a passion that will leave you almost breathless.  While watching Mario sing, you can tell that he feels every note of the music and every emotion that the song addresses.  His face, especially his eyes, are so expressive.  His training in acting and his experience in theatre (Phantom, Les Miz) have given him an incredible ability to become a different character within each song.
The voice of the Moody Blues, Justin Hayward, makes a special appearance to join Mario for Nights In White Satin.  Mario gives an introduction for most of the songs.  The concert includes all but one song from the album Sometimes I Dream.  The bonus section contains a Behind The Scenes featurette, Mario's biography, a photo gallery, and Mario's thoughts on each song.  The picture quailty and sound are first rate.  The editorial review is incorrect about subtitles - they are available in English, French and German.  I think it's safe to say that the average person does not speak fluent Italian or Greek, so the person who decided to include subtitles deserves a raise.  The concert portion is just about an hour and the featurette is around 10 minutes.  This is a great dvd and well worth the cost.  Mario is an amazing talent and he blows the ""competition"" (I don't need to throw names) out of the water with his vocal talent, passionate interpretation of songs, and amazing stage presence.  He is charming and attractive and will hopefully introduce a new generation to the operatic/pop classical hybrid of music.",1039305600,50,2048,4.805714285714286

1426083,5,B00005IAVR,"I have loved this man for years. Saw this special on PBS tonight and I'm baffled that he is not a major star like Bocelli. A much better cross-over than Andrea and emotes with such believability. If you have not heard his song Dance, you're missing a real treat. Search it out and prepare to be wowed.",1418428800,,301,4.298245614035087

1426113,5,B00005IAVR,"I play the DVD ""Sometimes I Dream"" over and over again.  It's like I'm attending his concert myself.  I'll play it while I'm doing dishes or just sitting in my room and watching and hearing him.  I appreciate the American subtitles to help me understand what he is singing.  I'm even learning some of the words in Spanish or Italian such as luna (moon) te amo (I love you). I truly enjoy Mario's DVD and have just purchased the CD of Mario sings Mario at Amazon.  I was a member of Mario Lanza's fan club when I was in my 20's (now 75)and believe he taught me the appreciation of opera and what I call ""good"" music.  I now love Mario Frangoulis' singing just as well.",1335484800,,667,4.253968253968254
1426114,5,B00005IAVR,"It is amazing to me that more people don't know who Mario Frangoulis is and have never heard his fantastic voice.  He is truly talented and needs a wider audience, however, for those of us who are lucky to have listened to his music are lives have been truly blessed and enhanced.  His duet on The Moody Blues hit ""Knights In White Satin"" is one for the ages...unbelievable!",1305849600,,374,4.485294117647059
1426115,5,B00005IAVR,"Great voice,  wonderful song selections, very entertaining, recommend you purchase especially if you like Il Divo you'll enjoy this too!  I think Mario is better than Josh Grobin.  Looking forward to the next CD.",1271808000,,212,5.176470588235294
1426116,5,B00005IAVR,We expected it too be longer. Most concert's last from 90 to 120 minutes. This one is a lot shorter. But it is great what is there.,1258243200,,131,3.888888888888889
1426117,5,B00005IAVR,"There's a good reason you see five stars top to bottom here. You will not skip a single track. You will also be finding yourself ordering the CD's available. This performance by the orchestra and vocalists is an amazing display of talent by everyone involved.- every instrument, every voice, every pluck of the guitar string...and the pluck and tug on your heart and emotions as well.
Oh how we all love a flawless voice!...and isn't it nice that this handsome man is also immensely likeable. The word is winsome or  affable.. yes you will ""loff heem"" ! The choice of music is a wonderful range of the most beautiful music composed in our generation. Now I ask you...why are you still reading!  You will never regret buying this DVD-nor will you willingly part with it. Unless maybe the judge will lighten your sentence if you slip him your copy. But don't let the jury see it...or you'll have to buy them one too.( wink )",1248825600,,922,4.581818181818182
1426118,5,B00005IAVR,"Excelent singer, with  a very particular style of music and voice. It's a pitty he is sharing the stage with Sarah Brightmann at New York in her show. He would deserve something better. This DVD is perfect. Beautiful place, great songs.",1242518400,,236,4.7560975609756095

1426120,5,B00005IAVR,"I want to start first by saying I was aware of Mario Frangoulis by having purchased both his two Cds. Mario in both of his two CDS, including Sometime I dream which all the songs from this Live show are from, made me aware of what a outstanding singer he really is. Both his CDS are must haves.
Mario in this DVD has makes you really feel like your in the Greek islands with him. Mario is truly a craftsmen in bringing you into each songs meaning.",1222732800,,447,4.149425287356322
1426121,5,B00005IAVR,"I loved Mario's voice the first time I heard it in 2002; it was such a great pleasure to finally get to watch him perform.
It is refreshing to see a young talent like Mario focused on music and performance rather than the commercial music industry, where looks and making money quickly are the focus.
Twenty years from now, when his youth is gone, and his good looks have faded, I predict that Mario Frangoulis will still be going strong and his voice will be another remarkable legend.

It is fantastic that concert recording such as this actually has English subtitles to explain the words of wonderful songs that I deeply loved, but did not completely understand.
How come no one thought of doing this before (few exceptions apply, some opera Theaters do display subtitles during live performances)? It would be great if other live concerts had English subtitles.

Great voice, great songs, great performance....being young and good looking is just the cherry on the cake",1218672000,,974,4.86144578313253
1426132,5,B00005IAVR,"This man will take you to a new sense of yourself. His talent is going to rocket him to stardom. What a voice, what feeling, what talent. Every song has such intense feeling and sends your emotions in a whirlwind. Thank you Mario. N.Bryan",1212537600,,238,4.431818181818182
1426133,5,B00005IAVR,"Mario's touch and beautiful voice is something  we don't hear too much here in the States....it's a shame that he is not on  PBS or some showcase to demonastrate his wonderful cross over style of singing........I'm a true
fan......of cross over singing and he's one of the best!",1207526400,,278,4.770833333333333
1426134,4,B00005IAVR,"Having listened to the CD of the same name  (Sometimes I Dream) for quite
some time, primarily for the title selection, which is an absolutely fabulous arrangement, it gives me great pleasure to rate the DVD as being even more enjoyable.  The singer is ingratiatingly naive in his announcements of each song, but his amazing vocal power and contemporary
arrangements are very satisfying and the subtitles of each text really enhance the total effect. Extra features re: his exceptional background and the various compositions are fascinating.  Relax and enjoy this phenomenal tenor with the slightly mysterious past!!!",1200614400,,618,5.350515463917525

1426140,5,B00005IAVR,"I originally heard him being played over the store loud speaker at Virgin Records, and after listening at a station to clips of each song, bought the album right away.

1426164,5,B00005IAVR,"Hello, I have known Mario Frangoulis for 2 years. Sometimes I dream is his first album. His second international album is also good. He made a Greek album in Greece in 2005. It makes sense to buy it if you like the first two albums.

This concert DVD is excellent and all live. In terms of REGION, amazon.com says unknown but the DVD is working in the US, so it is region 1.",1149638400,4,374,4.123287671232877

Mario sings in English, Italian, Greek and Spanish; and trust me, you will not CARE that you can't understand a word, Mario transmits so much emotion and passion thru his songs that you will enjoy this music, even if you don't understand what he's singing. He is THAT good! Mario sounds even better live than on the studio recorded CD of the same title.  I definitely will be looking for his live concert in the future.

I agree with all the reviews here, but if you still have any doubts, I should tell you this:  this concert had a lasting impact on my life.  It made me change my life and not give up on the power of true love. I found true love because these songs inspired me to.

What's not to admire?  I've purchased his CD ""Sometimes I Dream"" and his DVD concert ""Sometimes I Dream.""  Both are wonderful, and no other vocalist comes close to Mario's unique ability, talent and stage presence.  And the arrangements are terrific.  I can't wait until his next CD is released in the United States (I think I'll try to get it from Amazon.com. UK before February 2005---can't wait).  If Mario tours in the United States, believe me, I will run, not walk, to his concert.  He's very, very good.  Thank you Sony Music for bringing Mario to American audiences.

Tears in the eyes of the public are the best testimony of the greatness of this concert. I just hope there will not be too much wait until I can attend a live concert here in the US.

 This is music that will empower your soul. Not only Mario Frangoulis voice is spectacular, but his stage presence takes his music to new heights. He has charisma. He is the show. No need for ""artsy"" settings. Mario Frangoulis singing his hearth out, beautiful lyrics, a great orchestra. With songs like ""Vincer, Perder"", ""Non Sar"", ""Buon giorno principessa"", my favorites, he unleashes such an emotional power that you will feel yourself soaring to the sky. Or, at least, this is my case. I first watched the live concert on T.V., then I ran to order the CD album. Now, a few days ago I discovered the DVD. Terrific sound and image quality.

Mario has a great feel for the songs and the entrance of the great Justin Hayward for Nights In White Satin gave me goosebumps from head to toe.  It is not region crippled so playing it here in Australia was no problem.  If you've seen other concerts recorded in Greece you know what I mean I say it is spectacular and warm at the same time.

He is a charasmatic, experienced performer that feels the music, the lyrics, each note in his heart, mind, and soul.  He has the perfect blend of natural talent and learned technique.  His ability to properly translate lyrics into 5 languages is amazing and he proves he can sing anything!  He's opened a whole new musical world for me and started me on a path into classical/opera music.
The DVD is set in beautiful Thessaloniki, Greece and has a wonderful orchestra and choir supporting Mario.  The addition of his special guest, Justin Hayward (from the Moody Blues) on the classic song, Nights in White Satin is such a treat!  It's lovely to see the diverse audience in Greece show such love and respect for not only their own countryman, but also Justin Hayward.
Don't think twice about buying this DVD.  You'll never tire of watching Mario as he sings the hand-picked beautiful songs from his cd.",1067212800,14,1110,4.810526315789474

I had a tough time trying to remember the spelling of his name but in today's world you can find everything in the internet,and so I did find him.
This DVD, as well as the CD in my car, has given us many pleasurable hours of listening.
Good luck to Mario on his future CD's.",1057708800,8,530,4.116504854368932
1426198,5,B00005IAVR,"I caught this presentation on my local NYC PBS station in late 2002 while channel flipping.  I was struck by the range, power and enormous passion of his voice and ended up watching the whole concert.  Frangoulis was then on my local PBS station providing some live commentary after the broadcast.  He seems  like a humble person despite his amazing talent.
Frangoulis' duet with Moody Blues vocalist Justin Haywood on ""Nights in White Satin"" is one of those rare moments in music that is thrilling.  There's no other word for it.  The fact that this guy isn't a bigger star is a huge failure of Sony's marketing department, in my view.  He outshines just about every other male pop and classical vocalist I've ever heard. In terms of talent, he's a male equivalent of someone like Barbra Streisand or Whitney Houston.
So in short, it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this DVD, especially given the beauty of the outdoor ampitheater in Greece where it was staged.  Buy it and be amazed.",1055635200,17,989,4.709302325581396

Frangoulis talks about his choice of songs in a featurette, there is a photo gallery and more.  If you loved his cd, you will also want the concert dvd.

I feel that Frangoulis is going to be the next really big star singer and maybe become as popular or even more popular than Bocelli and Josh Groban.  Certainly, he is as exciting as they are. He has a beautiful voice, classically trained, and perfect in popular and classical music.  He is also a powerful performer.
This DVD is a must have, the quality and sound are great, and there are some nice bonus tracks.
The photography is so good you feel that are you actually in Greece at this concert.
Listen to the way Frangoulis sings (Hijo de la luna), and you will be transported!!!
Highly recommended.",1044921600,6,843,4.532894736842105
1426201,5,B00005IAVR,"The video Sometimes I Dream - Live in Concert in Thessaloniki, Greece, says it all about the artist. I have never seen a performer so beautiful to watch, belting all the songs in his CD album (minus Canzone Arrabiata) with so much passion and grace. Honestly, I could not find the right word to describe Mario Frangoulis, right now I am tongue-tied. The young man is supercalifragiliexpialidociously marvelous!!!!! The final song (title song Sometimes I Dream - E Lucevan le Stelle pop version) showcases his versatility as a singer. It is this song that sums up Mario Frangoulis. Bravo to him and also to the people who provided the subtitles. It was a treat to understand the songs (Italian, Greek, and Spanish). I urge the viewer to buy this CD. It is so addictive. You won't tire watching it over and over again. It is worth every penny you spend.",1042070400,4,851,4.68

7938362,5,B00005IAVR,"Sings every song from the first album except for one song (one of my favourites, sadly). However he is NOTE PERFECT on everything he sings. And he puts so much effort and intensity into everything he does when he performs... he takes himself so seriously. You also get to learn certain things about his upbringing and other such things when he talks between songs.... I would recommend this to any of his fans. My mum didn't care much for him when hearing just his CD, but she actually was wowed when she saw him sing the same songs live.

Beautiful venue, and the skies behind him in the evening/night are absolutely fantastic. It's a great piece of advertising for Greece!",1442275200,,674,4.616666666666666
