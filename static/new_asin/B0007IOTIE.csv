8205705,5,B0007IOTIE,"Being in Law Enforcement, I found this to be a very informational video for kids.  It's not put together to scare kids, just make them aware.  Unfortunately kids have the ""super hero syndrome"" when they are little and think they can conquer any bad guy.  This video gives them actual tactics to get away from a bad guy should they ever be grabbed.  It's not about the strength, it's about the technique.",1254355200,,403,4.555555555555555
8205706,5,B0007IOTIE,"As a parent and a teacher, I highly recommend this video.  It is an effective tool in teaching children what to do when a stranger approaches them.  The video is appealing to children without frightening them.  It gives them a sense of control in a potentially harmful situation.  They learn strategies that stick with them.",1111276800,,324,4.836363636363636
8205707,4,B0007IOTIE,"What a great DVD!!  Not only did it get my son up and moving, trying to do all the exercises on the DVD (none-stop, from beginning to end!!), but it also showed him what to do if a stranger tries to approach him, grab him, etc.  This is a MUST for every family that wants their children (of ANY age!) to be safe when they're outside playing or even just walking down the street.  If my 5-year old son can understand and do what they say on the DVD, so can your 13-year old daughter.

Better safe, than sorry.",1110240000,,508,4.101010101010101
8205708,5,B0007IOTIE,"Anyone with young children will find this DVD a great investment.  It teaches by demonstration and repetition how children can defend themselves against hostile adults.  One of it's great assets is that it's made with kids in mind.  They love to watch it and play along with the demonstratons.  In no time flat children become little experts in exactly what to do if they are approached by an adult who tries to threaten, bribe or actually abduct them.
