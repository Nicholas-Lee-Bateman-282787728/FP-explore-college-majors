8264408,5,B00170ID06,"Anyone over age 47 will remember these under the title ""Farmer Brown""(they seemed to like to re-title shows in the early 1960's) and they ran at the crack of dawn. This dvd brought back alot of memories. The soundtracks are dull on most of them, but there are moments when a 1920's song is used in the proper place. Picture quality is good, and thats what counts while watching silent films anyway. There are a couple of sound  films here too.  All in all, worth the low price.",1293148800,7,477,4.409090909090909
8264409,2,B00170ID06,"Beware....the silent toons have a boring piano track added to them....Music is so
crappy it takes away the fun of the cartoon....put the volume down.
The last 2 have sound sych to the action and are lots of fun",1269907200,9,210,4.410256410256411
8264410,4,B00170ID06,"Paul Terry's now forgotten Farmer Al Falfa (also: Alfalfa) was the star of the first ever sound cartoon, ""Dinner Time,"" which premiered a month before Walt Disney's ""Steamboat Willie."" The Mickey Mouse short was more popular by far, and is now incorrectly cited as the first animation with a soundtrack. Such are the vagaries of fame and fate. (Terry went on to create Heckle 'n Jeckle, Mighty Mouse and Deputy Dawg.)

His original cartoon star, ""Farmer Al,"" first appeared in 1916, when Terry animated for the Bray studio. He took his grizzled geezer with him when he left Bray in 1921, and starred Alfalfa in a series of Aesop's Film Fables, for the Path company. The majority of this set consists of these, while the two sound shorts were made at Terry's own studio and distributed by Educational Pictures.

Another early cartoon character created at Van Bueren (where Paul Terry was a minor partner until going on his own) may be seen on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-COMPLETE-ADVENTURES-OF-CUBBY-BEAR/dp/B0006UBMFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF CUBBY BEAR</a>.
