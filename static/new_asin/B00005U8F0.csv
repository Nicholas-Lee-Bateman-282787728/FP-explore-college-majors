1664478,5,B00005U8F0,"The second season of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS continues the saga of the Bellamy family of Eaton Place; their loves, losses and everyday life.
At the end of the first season, young Elizabeth Bellamy (played by Nicola Pagett) was publicly humiliated at the hands of political activist Evelin Larkin (Georgia Brown), before marrying the handsome Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in a lavish ceremony...
Season 2 includes the following episodes -
""The New Man"" - Elizabeth and Lawrence return from their honeymoon in Europe, and set up housekeeping in Greenwich. Rose (Jean Marsh) is on hand to make sure Elizabeth is well looked-after, but all is not well in their marriage.
""A Pair of Exiles"" - The erstwhile Sarah (Pauline Collins) confesses to her lover James Bellamy (Simon Williams) that she is carrying his baby. Sarah is then shipped off to Lady Marjorie's estate at Southwold for her confinement...
""Married Love"" - Elizabeth is angry and hurt that her marriage to Lawrence is still unconsummated, so Lawrence orgainises a discreet tryst between her and his publisher, Sir Edwin Patridge (Charles Gray).
""Whom God Hath Joined.."" - Elizabeth demands a divorce from Lawrence, but discovers that she is pregnant with Edwin's child.
""Guest of Honour"" - King Edward VII (played by Lockwood West) dines with the Bellamy family in this special episode, and Sarah makes a dramatic return to Eaton Place.
""The Property of a Lady"" - Thomas (John Alderton) and Sarah resort to drastic measures in order to help Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and the explosion of a secret from the past. This episode refers to events that took place in the season 1 episode ""Magic Casements"".

""A Special Mischief"" - Rose suffers a horrifying ordeal when she is mistakenly arrested as a suffragette.  Elizabeth meets Julius Karekin (Donald Burton).
""The Fruits of Love"" - A sudden financial crisis threatens the Bellamy's gilded world, and Julius Karekin offers a solution for the future of Elizabeth.

""A Family Gathering"" - Elizabeth breaks off her relationship, James returns from India with a new fiancee, Phyllis Kingman (played by Delia Lindsay), and Lady Marjorie's birthday celebration is interrupted by Thomas and Sarah. King Edward dies and the Bellamys all join together to mourn his passing. (This is the final episode for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah).

1664479,2,B00005U8F0,"I love the series, but the DVD quality is really bad.  I'm only on the 3rd of 4 disks and one episode was so bad I could only listen to the sound.  Trying to watch the screen gave me a headache.  The last episode I watched had large yellow bands across the screen.  It was just like watching it on a bad color TV set back when the series was released.  Since I also purchased the First season and thought the video quality on it was very good, this Second season is a particular disappointment.  Stay away unless you are a hardcore fan who has to have it.",1048636800,10,555,4.092592592592593
1664480,3,B00005U8F0,"Short and sweet here. This is an incredible screen play and I very much looked forward to the release on DVD. All three seasons have some type of problem be it audio, shadowing, discoloration untimely skips and pauses. The 3rd season is the best in video transfer, however during certain episodes the above information I listed still applies. I have contacted the distributor and they offered to replace all 3 seasons. I was told there is a recall from the first person then a supervisor told me they had no knowledge of any recall. The story line is priceless to bad the copies are not. I am betting down the road in a year or two they will release all new copies leaving us folk to fork out another bundle. My rating is not based on the story I can only give it 3 stars because A&E New Video should be ashamed of themselves.",1018051200,24,826,4.37012987012987
1664481,3,B00005U8F0,"A&E have done it again I'm afraid. Yet another Upstairs Downstairs DVD collection that has been sourced from dreadful master tapes. The color is all over the place and some episodes judder for their entire length.
Some episodes are not too bad quality-wise, but there have to better copies of this show tucked away in a vault somewhere - surely. It would really be a shame if this is the best that remains of this timeless series.",1017964800,8,430,4.597402597402597
1664482,2,B00005U8F0,"Unfortunately some of the material included in this series is almost unwatchable due to very poor picture and sound transfer.  This was not the case in the commercial video release of the same material or in the cable TV screening shown recently here in Australia.  The first series DVD transfer was not excellent, but it was better than this.  I'd love to know what the British DVD transfer (only series 1 to date) is like in comparison.  UPDATE 2004: The Australian DVD release of Series 2 has excellent picture and sound.",1014422400,4,524,4.725274725274725
1664483,2,B00005U8F0,"This is a disgrace!
This is a wonderful and unique series in television history mastered so poorly as to be nearly unwatchable.  The second episode of the first volume actually jitters for the entire 50 minute length.  A major step down from the well done first season set.
If you don't care about artifacting and display quality, by all means buy a copy.  But if you were looking for an even mediocre visual quality presentation, skip it.  I pray they don't screw up Season 3 this badly!!!!!!  A&E Home video should be ashamed of themselves for peddling such a dreadful presentation.",1010620800,22,584,4.742574257425742

1664558,5,B00005U8F0,What a treat to see some of the old UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.  It takes its time and allows the viewer to become part of the daily lives (not just the hugh moments of panic) that the family and servants face.  It's Proust whereas DOWNTOWN is  THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS.  The productions values are wonderful and the performances are solid.,1412467200,,335,4.627118644067797

1664560,4,B00005U8F0,Well done and outstanding British television. I watched this series back during the eighties and I can't remember a single episode. I guess that's telling on my age.

1664580,5,B00005U8F0,"Before there was Downton, there were stairs between servants and masters.  This series much more accurately portrays the schism between the classes, while not skimping on dignity, morality, or friendship.  Each episode is a mini-play, and every theme that Julian Fellows tackles in DA has been done before in this series--in a crisper, less exaggerated format.  This is drama, not melodrama.

It was filmed in the '70s, therefore not as polished as to setting and special effects. Costumes appear to be authentic for the period covered. Women's hats are works of art.",1395100800,,276,5.021739130434782

I was struck at how proud the downstairs staff was of the family they served, and how proud they felt about doing a good job. I was astonished how the upstairs toffs felt they were above the law,  and they used their money to cover their shady mistakes, whether it be gambling debts, illicit affairs,  or getting the help pregnant. This show is from the 70s, but was very well done. Don't expect the extravagances of Downton Abbey, this is a small house in London with half a dozen servants.",1395014400,,576,4.528846153846154

A lot of similarities, but the families are different, and the London house setting is much smaller, so there is a smaller servant staff.  Highly recommend!!",1394841600,,409,4.472972972972973

1664598,5,B00005U8F0,"In my opinion, the greatest dramatic series ever presented on television.
It's a pity that it seems to have been left behind by modern viewers, Certainly it's apt to feel old-fashioned in terms of style---shot on videotape, no fancy camera work or jazzy editing, more like a drawing room play than a movie or television show.

It's natural audience would be the same  viewers that eagerly await each new episode of Downton Abbey. And of course Upstairs Downstairs was undoubtedly the inspiration for Downton Abbey, But anyone who seriously gives Up-Down a fair chance may find that it has a greater depth and resonance than the newer show. Characters that are truly unforgettable and a world that seems somehow more real and believable than Downton. I doubt the show can ever again attain the popularity it had upon it's original broadcast, times have simply changed too much for that, But those who are adventurous enough to give it a shot may find themselves longing to return to the world of Eaton Place again and again over the years.",1390953600,,1038,4.825842696629214

1664604,5,B00005U8F0,"""Upstairs, Downstairs"" remains the original, and the best, of the Edwardian stories, as far as I am concerned. Yes, I really enjoy ""Downton Abbey,"" as well, but when one watches this marvelous series, it becomes apparent that Julian Fellowes also watched it. The characters are very clearly drawn and the idiotic ""rules"" of the upper class British society of that time are truly laid bare; i.e., Hudson, the butler, angrily reprimanding Edward, the footman, for handing the post directly into the hands of the master, rather than placing it on a silver salver and then handing it to Mr. Bellamy. How absurd. This series doesn't have the wonderful Highclere castle or the modern production values of ""Downton Abbey,"" but it doesn't need them. The story lines are strong and the characters make you care about them. If you enjoy this period in history, by all means watch ""Upstairs, Downstairs.""",1390435200,,893,5.0

The acting is comical at times, but there are some star performers on this show (Mrs. Bridges, Lady Marjorie, etc.).  I love how histrionical events are woven into the plot, and allow viewers to have glimpse in to how people from 1890 to the early 1920's reacted to such events, like the sinking of the Titanic.

After watching the first 3 episodes, and seeing how bad the plot got (very soap opera like) I decided not to finish.  I got enough of the badness of what was coming by reading the short descriptions, and only one or two episodes stood out as being interesting or worthwhile.  I like happy endings and don't want to waste time on watching affairs and un-needed drama.  It looked like a lot of un-needed drama until the end of the series so I stopped watching altogether.

I still wish I would have viewed it prior to Downton Abby.  There are many simular themes.  They were filmed almost 40 years apart, and I hate to compare them, but I can't help it.

1664677,5,B00005U8F0,"I am sorry to admit that I have only recently discovered this series, and that too by way of the remake, which is available via streaming as well. I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).

This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during this season is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, and the plight of the poor, among others.

The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Southwold, and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, a kitchen maid, and many more.

Each episode has an interesting plot hook that keeps the viewer interested and eager to learn what happens next. The second season was even better than the first and that's saying a lot! Bellamy daughter Elizabeth is married, but her marriage remains unconsummated. The sexual tension between husband, the poet Lawrence Kirbridge, and Elizabeth have some serious consequences that places the Bellamy family name in jeopardy. James, the philandering son and alcoholic gets more seriously involved with former housemaid Sarah Moffatt (Pauline Collins) and this too provides more heartbreak for all concerned.

Steadfast through it all is head parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh) who helps Elizabeth set up her new household but who eventually finds her way back to the Bellamy's at 165 Eaton Place. A new staff joins the household - a cunning young man named Thomas Watkins (John Alderton, real life husband of Pauline Collins).

There is much excitement this season, with clever plot twists that had me riveted to the screen! Even staid, dependable Hudson has a moment of weakness, giving in to vanity and pride, and suffering the consequences. This season sees infidelities, marital strife, blackmail, pregnancies and deliveries, and many more!

1664679,4,B00005U8F0,"Love this series. Excellent performances all around, and the story lines deal with serious social issues and changing times of the early 1900s while providing interesting character portraits and moral tales that still resonate today. Sarah, the servant girl who longs to be more and lives for drama and romance, dares to cross boundaries between master and servant--and pays the price. Her ""betters"" show their weaknesses and lack of self-awareness, their hypocritical tendencies, yet they reveal that they can be decent and fair, too.  None of the characters, upstairs or downstairs, are cartoons; they are all human, all flawed, all interesting. Tom, the chauffer, is a likeable con man, figuring out how far he can go with his clever deceptions while still maintaining  self-respect. We wonder which path he'll take; it's not predictable. Lady Elizabeth is a young, gullible liberal, defying social convention but duped by  social reformer friends whose intentions are not always what they seem. She becomes more hardened with each of life's betrayals, and we wonder if she will respond by reverting to her roots and becoming a bitter imitation of her conservative parents. James, the son, is a spoiled drunkard who has lost his way in the world, a tragic figure packed off to India when he causes a scandal, separated from the one person he loves in the world.  Who will he be when he returns? Who will they all become? The character development is rich and complex, and as they make their voyage through this fascinating period, we want to watch each twist and turn down the road.",1321488000,2,1585,4.992424242424242
1664680,5,B00005U8F0,"I first saw this series in the early 1970's when it was shown on Center for Public Television, the first I ever saw on this network; and loved this series:Upstairs Downstairs, as I had never seen a tv show set in England and about this period.(Edwardian)I stayed home every Sunday nite for months to catch this show as it was completely captivating,interesting, the actors well portrayed.(Lesley ann Down I think was in this series; she is now on American Soap-Bold & Beautiful. I recently bought this series on DVD and treasure watching it often; Highly Recommend this series..",1294444800,,578,4.908163265306122
1664681,5,B00005U8F0,"Because I was working full time, attending nursing school at one college and working on a master's degree in history in another, I had no time to view this series when it originally aired, but I heard so much about it at the time from friends who were committed viewers, that I've always felt that I'd missed something.  When I saw that it was now on DVD, I decided I'd see what all the fuss was about.  Because I didn't know if I'd like the series, I decided to start with the final season.  If it was going to bore me, it would certainly do so by the end of its run when most series have started to run out of ideas and the key actors have gotten tired of their roles.  I was very surprised.  I loved the commitment of the fine character actors to their presentations and the social significance of the individual stories.  Needless to say, I watched the entire five seasons.

Season two has a lot going for it.  The characters, first introduced in season one, have matured and developed into real people with real pasts, presents and foreseeable futures.  They make human mistakes and deal with them in ways that are commensurate with their individual histories and their own financial, social and psychological resources.

Particularly interesting were the contrasts between the responses to socially unfortunate pregnancies by the Upstairs Elizabeth and the Downstairs Sarah.  The contrast between the behaviors of the males in their lives to their situations was also illuminating.  James Bellamy seems without a will or direction of his own and waits for others to take care of the situation he has helped to create, while Thomas uses the situation to the advantage of both Sarah and himself creating a new life for the two of them.  In fact, I found both Sarah and Thomas very intriguing and complex characters.

This season the wasted lives of the Bellamy children become much more apparent.  Having watched season five first, I can now see why their lives came out as they did in the end.  With a primary focus on public appearance and opinion  and on having a good time rather than on internal integrity, the two seem to lack any kind of map or compass for choosing a direction in life.  This is especially so for Elizabeth who seems to want to leave a social legacy of some kind to the future but doesn't want it to be too difficult or inconvenient.  The two young aristocrats are poised on the cusp of political, social, and technological change which they seem to sense is going to change everything, but they seem totally incapable of rising to the challenge.

The automobile and electricity are in the process of changing how life is lived, while creating a new avenue for personal advancement and growth based on ability rather than social class.  In fact, these venues provide a forum for the expression of ability which is virtually closed to those of upper class standing by virtue of being in ""business"" or in ""working with the hands"" which is considered beneath them.  Meanwhile these same self-made men, whose social background is not establishment, have decided to enter politics using money as their entre into upper class society.  Even as they do so, the values and expectations of that society are being diluted, eroded and changed.  When Thomas and Sarah enter the living room of the Bellamys to present Lady Margaret with a birthday gift, not as servants but as successful private people, there is an awkward confrontation between the classes they represent, but the audience is also left with a sense that change is in the wind.  The Sarahs and Thomases will be the future.  The Bellamys will be history.  Even as they all grieve over the death of the Old King at the end of the evening, we know that more has died than a man.

Meanwhile women are in a state of rebellion, demanding enfranchisement in order to leverage their demands in society; where their voices are not willingly heard, their turn to violence is ignored with difficulty.  Yet the nasty response of the male dominated political system, while predictable, is something with which upper class women like Elizabeth or middle class individuals like Rose are ill prepared to deal.  Like the miners in another episode of the series, they are dealt with harshly and their protests muted and subverted.

Though the series is predominantly filmed on a sound stage, a la daytime soaps, the sets are fantastic and the costumes and illumination make the era come alive.  The reappearance of some of the lovely gowns and day dresses at different occasions makes the action seem ""real life.""  It's not just one whirlwind of new dresses daily.  Making the series more real also was the occasional inconvenience, such as the plaster dust that arose during the introduction of electricity to the house or the noise that disturbed the household while the workmen installed it.

Probably my favorite episode of Season 2 was that of the two pairs of brothers.  The differences between the interactions between Mr. Bellamy and Dr. Bellamy as opposed to those between the elder and younger Mr. Hudsons were very illuminating and rather dear.  I felt it furthered immensely the understanding of these two central characters.

A wonderful series.",1283385600,,5222,4.793296089385475
1664682,1,B00005U8F0,"The original series is undeniably great entertainment, but these mis-mastered DVD's would be unacceptable even if done by an amateur. The fact that A&E is pressing the sets by the thousands is unconscionable.  The 3rd and 4th episodes in disk 1, for instance, are mastered with offset fields such that they jitter and bob through the entire length. (episodes 1 and 2 are acceptable.) It is hard to advise even a fan of the series to waste their money on these sets.  These are some of the worst mastered DVDs I have ever viewed in my life.  Series 1 also contains gross technical issues.  One can only deduce that A&E cares not a whit for the technical quality of their DVDs.  If you can tape these from a TV or cable showing, you will have a far superior copy.  It is sad.  Not even suitable for viewing on a laptop computer.",1271635200,6,826,4.430463576158941

7954347,5,B00005U8F0,"This may be the best over all example of what a series CAN be when strong and multi layered writing is handled by superb actors and a directors who may HELP the actors but who get out of the way and let them work. As one who writes, acts, and directs I believe that actors should welcome, ask for and use the minds and ""souls"" of writers and Directors and EVERY other member of a crew.

Actors are the final link to an audience,,, meaning they have the most ability to make a project fail,,, of succeed.

It looks to me as though the people involved in all of the seasons of this series knew that and made the whole thing wonderful.",1519516800,,632,4.172131147540983
