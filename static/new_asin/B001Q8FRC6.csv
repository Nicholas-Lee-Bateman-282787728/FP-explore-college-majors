8335223,4,B001Q8FRC6,This is not about the notes you need to play but how you need to play them. Rick assumes you know the notes so he takes you through a series of chapters on how to make them work for him and for you. I am still working on step one - move. Something here for all players.,1481414400,,269,3.736842105263158
8335224,5,B001Q8FRC6,"Gave this to the harmonica player in my band and he said he wished he'd had this years ago.  Rick teaches a few harmonica techniques, but a lot about being a musician and some great tips and techniques to become a great Blues player!  Rick is a funny guy as well, so the video is entertaining as well as instructional.",1471737600,,318,4.283333333333333
8335225,3,B001Q8FRC6,"Not a great video if you are starting out on the harmonica. It is designed for someone who has experience in playing. Rick Estrin is one of my favorite players, but I have to say that the whole DVD is Rick talking about different playing styles and then playing them. There is no instruction on what he is doing or the key he plays in. All you can do is try to figure out on your own what is being done.",1454284800,4,403,3.9876543209876543

8335228,5,B001Q8FRC6,"Completely different from all other approaches to harmonica instruction, this is the one I have been looking for! Now that Jerry Boogie Mc Cain has passed on, Rick Estrin now wears the mantle of the coolest harp player on the planet and he generously shares his considerable insights with us.  He has thought long and hard about this and it shows. I'm savouring this and taking notes. Thanks Rick, it was worth the wait. PS Don't be a chump and download it, pay the rent 'cause he's paid his dues.",1409443200,3,497,4.522222222222222
