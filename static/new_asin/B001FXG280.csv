8302971,5,B001FXG280,"An extremely well-done documentary about an amazing man who has done amazing work in his lifetime. I vaguely remember these horrible events on my TV in my comfortable living room, this man lived it.",1518220800,,198,4.852941176470588
8302972,5,B001FXG280,"A very moving documentary that will make you think. Definitely worth viewing and owning. Well-made, and Orbinski provides insightful observations in his interviews. He is clearly being honest and blunt.",1496793600,,202,5.766666666666667
8302973,5,B001FXG280,"*This movie is a bit graphic in descriptions - note for younger viewers.
I have always been a fan of Dr. Orbinski and this movie only made me think more of him. This movie is inspiring and heartbreaking. It truly opens eyes to the realities of humanity, and makes one think of current global issues.  How are we to respond to the world around us? What is it that defines our humanity? This is a wonderful film. Just beware, it's not a lite documentary. This film will ultimately make you think.",1407283200,,494,4.428571428571429
8302974,3,B001FXG280,"This dvd exposes the dilemma of health care in the developing world...which is always depressing.  It does give a realistic view of how things are.  I used to live in Africa.  It does show the struggle and impact it can have on those who are involved and care.  However, I will say, that the dvd the dvd could have done more to expose and address the corruption of the governments themselves that create these problems.  Much of the funding and donations end up in the hands of corrupt governments, hence the incredible frustration and the black hole of poverty and despair.",1371600000,,574,4.643564356435643
8302975,4,B001FXG280,"Fortunately for those caught in a humanitarian crisis such as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, there are people like Dr Orbinski and Doctors Without Borders who pitch in to help. But will resources be able to match the needs? The DVD deals with more than the dilemma people who are trying to help face although we are not shown the more gruesome details of the massacres. Orbinski's DVD and book are for those not afraid to look at confronting issues.",1361664000,2,447,4.6
8302976,5,B001FXG280,"This is a film that raises important questions, although not even Orbinski, the former president of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, has the answers. The camera loosely follows him in recent days when he revisits the places where he had worked--Somalia, Rwanda, Congo--and is meant to be far more emotive than it is educational. It casts Orbinski in a morally infallible light, almost as a symbol for the principles behind MSF, and is largely couched in the vernacular of classic western humanitarianism. It hints at the ambivalence and complications behind that perspective but does not dig deeper, choosing instead to concede to a purported communication gap between the sheltered audience and those who were ""there"". Overall, the film is thought-provoking despite suffering from a poverty of factual content.",1321920000,9,818,5.5
8302977,5,B001FXG280,6 copies of DVD...just as promised! very happy with my purchase.  I would use this seller again.,1245024000,,96,4.647058823529412
