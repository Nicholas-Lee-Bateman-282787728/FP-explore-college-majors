It's one of those kind off shows that sometimes makes you literally laugh out loud, and sometimes it's achingly sweet and sometimes it makes you bawl - like ugly cry, complete face wet, drowning in tears, chin quivvers etc. All the characters have their own unique brand of insanity and funny little quirks that make them each annoyingly endearing. And there are like 5 or 6 seasons so you won't fall in love with them all and then have to wait forever to get to find out what happens next. And you will want to know, believe me this is one that might make you stay up until 3 am watching the next and the next and the next! I highly recommend this, you will enjoy it as much as I am!",1475366400,,749,4.201388888888889
8490780,3,B0061BECLU,"I usually like Aussie stuff and recently loved a couple of Aboriginal -casted series.  However, this Offspring series falls very flat for me.  The writing is mediocre, the acting is not so good, and it's too disjointed and deliberately quirky.  Music distracts rather than complements.  Won't finish the rest of the season after giving two episodes a try.  Has its moments, but overall very boring.",1473033600,,398,5.061538461538461
8490781,4,B0061BECLU,"First of all, you need a region-free DVD player to play this set.  I have no idea what PAL is as versus non-PAL, but this played fine on my region-free DVD player (which can be purchased for about the same price as any other DVD player; also, many DVD players can be made region-free).

Like all shows, you have to accept a number of premises.  The lead character, a nurse, is cute, and has fantasies like Ally MacBeal.  She is reasonably funny; and her sister, Kat Stewart, is wonderful as a narcissistic half-psycho.

All of the characters have a lot of personality and quirks, but most you are able to accept and enjoy.

On the negative side, this first season is hard to understand and there are no subtitles (I purchased the 5 season set and not this particular season alone).  So, there are some sharp quips I know that I missed.

Also, a negative for me is, there is a lot of swearing--both obscenity and profanity.  Also, there is a lot of sex, sexual references, but very little nudity (I don't recall any in season one).  It is not really suitable for teens to watch.

There is a wonderful treat in the last or next-to-last show, with a cameo appearance by Shaun Micallef, who interacts with Kat Stewart.  It is only 5 minutes, but it is quite entertaining, as they are much different characters than they are on Mr. and Mrs. Murder.

Like many shows, this will certainly have a liberal bias when it comes to sexual morality and liberal views.

It is far more cleverly written than the average show and nearly all of the characters are interesting.

The only bonus features are bits done by two mostly minor characters in the show.  Throughout the first season, you do not tend to see these characters as particularly clever or nuanced, but they do this 3 or 5 minute bits, in character, in the hospital, which are quite brilliant and reasonably funny.  They come across as so natural in these bits that they appear to be improvising; however, these bits are apparently scripted.  These are very unusual for extras.",1468627200,,2025,4.5777777777777775
