8352294,5,B00267S566,"Highly intelligent and informative political discussion that puts the ""discussion"" we see today on cable television to shame. Here was thoughtful analysis by all participants, tolerance and respect for opposing views, and articulate presentation by all -- even by the liberal student. Most surprising is that they were discussing (in 1971!) the same exact issues that are discussed today, except we are much too dumbed down today to ever have an enlightening and civil political discussion like this. My suggestion: turn off the TV and watch all the Firing Line episodes available. You'll learn so much more about what's going on today (again, the issues are amazingly the same!) than you will by watching the garbage that now passes for political discussion, and you'll be better equipped to understand and deal with it. Highly, highly, highly recommended.",1461110400,3,857,5.262773722627737

Firing Line was one of the last great programs to deal with issues in the raw.  Thanks Amazon for making them possible to watch again.",1459209600,2,300,4.711538461538462
