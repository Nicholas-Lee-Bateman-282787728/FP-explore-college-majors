8298787,1,B001ELXT4I,"I hoping both movies would have a good story. But both stories were slow, boring, and very uninteresting. I think I'm going to just throw it in the trash.",1392163200,,154,4.344827586206897
8298788,3,B001ELXT4I,"If only the Christine Lindberg -Laura Gemser 70's euro-chicks team had been willing to take a crack at making fun of shocking 70's euro movies (the first ""Emanuelle !"" movie came out that year in the 70's), we might have actually had a decent sex movie parody.",1386547200,,260,4.553191489361702
8298789,1,B001ELXT4I,"This is the USA censored version of ""Secrets of Sweet Sixteen"" cut by over 4 minutes, dialogue censored, ZOOM IN's to remove pubic hair, any ""radical political statements"" removed, etc etc etc, and horribly cropped on top and bottom from a washed out print. Plus a completely useless, uninformative commentary from what seems to be a bunch of drunks who know nothing about the film. The only way to see this film UNCUT and remastered is on a Dutch DVD which is quite difficult to find unfortunately.",1305763200,11,499,4.747126436781609
8298790,4,B001ELXT4I,"I really liked the Christine Lindberg movie, although she had a fairly small role. The other ""movie"" was just an aerobics video and it really sucked. I would recommend this purchase for the Secrets Of Sweet Sixteen movie, I just can't understand why the second ""movie"" was paired with this, it makes no sense.",1264377600,7,309,4.7407407407407405
