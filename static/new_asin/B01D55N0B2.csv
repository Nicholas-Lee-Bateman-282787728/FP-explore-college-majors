7697156,5,B01D55N0B2,"My kids -- a 4yo boy and 6yo girl -- absolutely love this movie! I never leave Amazon reviews but just had to share how thrilled we are that there's FINALLY a girl-focused superhero movie! And the action was entertaining enough and gender neutral enough to keep my son engrossed, too, so don't write this one off as a ""girl movie."" Not overly violent or scary and a decent representation of diversity among the main characters. Please make more DC Superhero Girls cartoons!",1470960000,11,473,4.710843373493976
7697157,5,B01D55N0B2,"We ordered this the day it came out and my girls love it. We've watched it 3 times in the first two days.

Here's what I like about the story and characters:
Beast Boy, Cyborg and Starfire all sound similar to the voices used in the original Teen Titans show. We liked the older series much better than Teen Titans Go! because they actually fought villains and it wasn't so frenetic. The characterization of these three keeps the humor and the quirks and returns to who they are as heroes.

The main characters are fairly well developed, yet not complex. They are also light hearted and don't fall into the trap of not sounding like dopes. They are good characters for the younger fan. It would be good to see some complexity introduced if the writers can keep the darkness that most heroes have at bay.

Things I'd like to see - my daughters already know that Harley, Cat Woman, and Poison Ivy are villains. They've been asking how they got from being good to turning to evil. It would be cool if we could see some foreshadowing so that when they are ready to move to Justice League or Batman, that the transition makes sense to them. I don't want them to end up hating a great show like Justice League because they feel Harley is misrepresented. Harley's character is really fun, so I wouldn't want her to turn dark. But it would be good to see how her shortcomings might set her up.

We look forward to move episodes and movies. So far, this is a solid start.",1470873600,8,1462,4.4037037037037035
7697158,5,B01D55N0B2,"My daughter and I were lucky enough to enjoy front row seats at the ""DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year"" movie premier this year at San Diego Comic-Con 2016. And we both absolutely LOVE this new Super Hero Girls movie! So many unexpected DC Universe fan-favorites show up throughout the entire movie, keeping the audience emotionally vested and wanting to see more & more... And as always with the AMAZING DCSHG creative team, the art direction, writing/dialogue and individual character development are kept current & engaging... all while inconspicuously sending out positive feel-good confidence-building messages into every direction.",1469404800,15,641,5.42
7697159,4,B01D55N0B2,"Is this the tv special that aired on Boomerang? Well, based on this movie's description, it's NOT. It's a new 72 minute movie about a male villain named Black Opal who threatens the heroes. The Boomerang special titled ""Super Hero High"" was only 60 mins and focused on Supergirl's arrival to the school. This new movie doesn't also appear to be a compilation of the season one online shorts (which also air daily on Boomerang). Those shorts all have individual stories. The titles are very confusing though because this new movie is called ""Hero of the Year"" and a few of the shorts are titled ""Hero of the Month: so-and-so"". The title of the Boomerang tv special is ""Super Hero High"" and the title of the first season one short is ""Welcome to Super Hero High"". Bad job with the titles but the show is cool. Maybe the Boomerang tv special will be included with this movie or at least released separately at some point, I hope.

UPDATE 6/21/16 *** The back cover artwork now is available and confirms this an all new movie. Unfortunately, the hour-long ""Super Hero High"" tv movie that appeared on the Boomerang network is not included as a bonus feature. Instead, we get only seven of the thirteen first season shorts (and not in chronological order). I'm guessing the tv special will be released in the future with the remaining season one online shorts added as bonus content, why else would they just include the first half on this new dvd? Great cover though. So much better than the less exciting initial one.",1466294400,11,1513,4.645522388059701

7697187,2,B01D55N0B2,"If you've ever been around the toy section, seeing these cutesy DC super girls, this is what they're using to sell them. Because I went in expecting a train wreck, I made a point of writing down my reactions throughout the movie. Honestly, we all want to spread our love for these characters, so it's natural parents would want to have something suitable for their younger kids. This is especially difficult when these have been made almost exclusively by boys for boys. For all you parents with young daughters, I held my nose and dove in for the treasure hunt nobody wants to do themselves. Here below is my review of DC Super Girls: Hero of the Year.

Now, I should start off with a bit of a qualifier. I've enjoyed My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, although not as much lately. As this is also made with young girls in mind, I'm naturally going to be drawing some parallels here. Specifically, this entire premise is essentially Equestria Girls. You should've probably guessed that when you see Batgirl & Wonder Woman at essentially the same age. For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, the concept is basically taking everyone in the DC Universe and shoving them into a high school setting. It's not entirely as dumb as it sounds, but it's close. This is effectively the pill you have to swallow before ever considering this piece. If you're the type who hates all the varying interpretations of Batman & Superman throughout their movies, you'll have none of this. You have to be willing to accept things are just different here.

To my dismay, this is not the entry point in the series, so there's not much world building. In fact, this apparently is a web series that's been going on for a while. It's got 3 seasons with 46 episodes total! It starts with introducing Big Barda, who apparently has a bad history with the ""school"" and is now a new student. The girls all fight her until she is saved by Principal WALLER?! I mean, ok, I should've seen this coming, but wow! Yes, she pretty much personifies administration, but she's also very nasty. Whatever, the DC equivalent of Nick Fury is here, and I'm actually very disappointed she's not fat. If the goal is ""girl power"" to give good role models, wouldn't it also be nice to have an overweight role model? She's one of the very few overweight characters I know that, rather than being comic relief, is actually a very hard-nosed, no-nonsense, power player! Unfortunately, Big Barda's introduction is largely meaningless. Normally, introducing a former enemy into the ranks would mean that they become the focus, especially if that's how you start a movie as opposed to an ongoing series. I fully expected her to be the Sunset Shimmer of this movie, but no. The characters have a bit of drama at first, and then she's not even connected to the main story later beyond saving her biggest hater.

Unsurprisingly, Jim Gordon is a teacher here, but he's still addressed as ""commissioner"" as if that's his name. Someone apparently got a bit too attached to 90's Batman. What really throws me for a loop is another main staff member is Crazy Quilt! Such a random choice to throw in here! He's pretty much comic relief, displaying a flamboyant personality while also directing their theater & dance. I did appreciate the cameos by Dove & Hawk, and there's probably also a bunch of other characters thrown to the side I never noticed (the Justice League is a big tent, after all). My favorite guests would be the Teen Titans, of which we get Cyborg, Beast Boy, & Starfire (why are we excluding Raven?) All the Teen Titans are voiced by their traditional voice actors, and because we've always seen them as teenagers, there really isn't any transformation to be had. If you loved them before, you'll love them now (except maybe not Cyborg, who now basically exists just to say ""booyah""). Greg Cipes' performance as Beast Boy does drop a little here, though. I got the feeling it was someone else trying to imitate him.

Honestly though, Harlequinn absolutely steals the show! She doesn't get that much screen time, but everything gels perfectly for her! I know some people are still bitter that Tara Strong basically replaced Arleen Sorkin as of Arkham City, but she's here because she always does a truly amazing job! The writers clearly know exactly what to do with her, too. Her slapstick comedy is always on par with her witty quips. I admit I couldn't help laughing at her spring-loaded boxing glove coming out of her backpack. I get the feeling she's trying to channel some of Pinkie Pie with her character here. Really, with how many people compare Pinkie Pie to Joker, it wouldn't be out of place at all. She doesn't have much to do with the main plot, but maybe that's for the best so as not to make this video too Tiny Toons.

Sadly, not all of the characters are great. The villains are some of the worst I've ever seen. You get Dark Opal allying with Eclipso, who in my 10-second research is probably the Jean Loring version. Dark Opal is constantly failing & whining worse than Skeletor. Eclipso is a cookie-cutter, basic force of evil, being bad because it's what she does. She doesn't even take any joy in being evil. She just phones it in like she needs to cash a paycheck. Even when she's about to win, she still sounds ambivalent to it all. These two drive the movie down so hard, it's entirely because of them that I can't recommend this movie at all to anyone. If this were more a slice of life piece without them, the main characters are actually ok enough to excuse it, but there's just too much focus on these wastes of villainy. At least TMNT's Bebop & Rocksteady were stupid enough you could appreciate them as childish. They somehow need to gather artifacts from across the galaxy that happen to coincide at Superhero High, yet not really because most of the main characters are terrestrial. They basically summon shade creatures to sneak into the school & steal all these things, except for some Nth metal from Hawgirl that Dark Opal takes. If all these things are put into one device, it can be used with the gem on top of Superhero High to somehow, someway just control everything (literally, it is that vague). The one thing they can't snatch is a crystal Supergirl wears as a necklace because it has some kind of protection spell on it. It has to be given willingly, so they just kidnap all the parents who get screen time to exchange for the crystal. Granted, with Dark Opal being connected to a place called Gemworld, this focus on gems & crystals is not without merit, but all the potential is just wasted with such a less-than-basic plot. Even with the climax, all these shade minions go down easier than Rita Repulsa/Bandora's putty soldiers!

Ultimately, this whole thing is one big Mickey Mouse adventure. If you've got a kid that likes cartoons featuring Minnie Mouse & Daisy Duck, fine, this will also be entertaining. It has redeeming values in the protagonists, but the plot & villains are so astoundingly awful as to wash out all the goodwill they make. Oh yeah, and remember that subtitle: Hero of the Year? Well, that's basically just a big ""employee of the month"" contest that is absolutely never developed, simply awarded at the end. You've got a reformed villain, a high achievement award, a plan to conquer the universe, and probably other solid story points that could have made for greats. If there were more great possibilities, I can't remember them because NONE of them were ever explored! The one real plotline running throughout all this is Supergirl's crystal starting to activate messages left by her mother and she starts to focus so much on the parents she's lost. Other than that, this whole movie is just a series of events with bright colors. With little substance, minimal character development outside of Supergirl, & basically no motivation for anything, I really can't recommend this for anything besides sitting in your movie library for the kid to maybe sometimes pull out because they're bored. Harlequinn & Beast Boy are the only bright spots to this movie, and I know it's blasphemy to ever suggest that Tara is anything less than a goddess, but she is not strong enough to carry an entire movie as a minor supporting character. If anyone could, it would be her, but she can't.

All that said, it does get me interested in seeing what the series was before. There was so much time devoted to these flops of villains. Big Bertha didn't have much time before, but from what I saw here, she could've been interesting. Maybe the series is the equivalent of Marvel's Super Hero Super Squad show, which at least could be clever in its campy comedy style. Even if it is, this movie clearly doesn't do it justice.",1493337600,,8742,4.6690460739779365

We have watched old Spider-Man cartoons and some Batman, Avengers, and similar cartoons, but there are always fewer women and condescending male villains.  I am glad for this cartoon where it is assumed the girls are not weak.  I also love that in this high school of superheroes, there is not really any (in this movie) girl drama or mean girls.  There is some hostility between an ex villain And one of her victims, but it is worked out and legitimate drama.

My six year old son enjoys it too, though he insists it's because of Beast Boy and Cyborg. And it does have a pretty good story. Entertaining all around. That said, it does get off to a slightly rocky start, especially when they have the characters toss in the ""cool modern"" lingo. Almost like they made the movie, some exec said they had to add in a bunch of crap they thought would make it better, and they rewrote the first half hour to include that stuff. Once you get past that, though, it's a decent kids' movie! Now if someone would just make a super hero property for ALL kids, instead of just for girls or focused on boys.

7697307,2,B01D55N0B2,"Well the first time we watched this my daughter walked over the the DVD player and hit eject so she could watch something more interesting.

The second time she fell asleep.

And it's not hard to see why.

DC Superhero Girls is not so much a movie with a story as a bunch of nifty character designs put out to sell toys.  Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Supergirl and other DC characters get a high school make over as preppies, goths and nerds and compete for the chance to be Hero of the Year.  But a mystery villain is stealing their super gadgets!

The film throws in characters by the bucketful.  Not just the major characters like Supergirl, but minor ones like Harley Quinn and Katana, and highly obscure ones like Dark Opel, Princess Amethyst and Eclipso.  The cartoon version of the Teen Titans also make an appearance to remind us how much better their show is :)

Seriously, once you're including characters like Big Barda, Lady Shiva and the 'Master Alchemist of Themyscira', your story is too crowded!

And the result is a confusing mess.  My girls (age 3) constantly ask 'who's that?' 'what is she doing?' and while they may enjoy the bright costumes and adventure they have no idea at all what is going on.

The special features include a few 3 minutes shorts that are easier for little kids to follow, but I think a collection entirely made of shorts might be better.

The choice of characters also show's DC's problem of trying to be both G-rated and R-rated at the same time.  For example Amanda Waller (now skinny as a rail for some reason), Katana and Harley Quinn just appeared in the R-rated Suicide Squad movie and are definitely not kids' characters.

When my toddlers ask 'who's that?' am I really supposed to say 'Oh she's the Joker's doctor who he abused and manipulated until she became an insane serial killer'?  DC's efforts to have characters that are both kid-suitable and feature in violent adult stories makes including them very messy.

A few years back DC had a series of short cartoon called Super Best Friends Forever featuring a small group of characters Supergirl, Batgirl and Wonder Girl.  They were silly short stories with some knowing winks to comic fans.  Something in that vein would have been great.  But Super Hero Girls is just a confusing mess that feel more like a marketing campaign than a movie.

EDIT: Attempt 3, the girls asked to see it again the other day and this time sat for almost an hour before wandering off to find better things to do.  It's clear they want to like it, they like the idea of Supergirl and Wonder Woman and Batgirl, but the delivery is just off.  This DVD bores both the comic-fan daddy and the kids.

EDIT 2: My girls still want to like this, and still ask for it, but still can't sit through it.",1477267200,7,2768,4.55668016194332
7697308,5,B01D55N0B2,"My daughter loves DC Super Hero Girls, so we picked this DVD up as soon as we could. I found it a little overstuffed, but they did a great job balancing all the characters, and the movie is charming. My daughter (6) was a little less enthused, simply because the movie had a real superhero-comic story as opposed to the high school hijinks that dominate the webisodes, and animated villains scare her. (But not live action ones, so YMMV.) We both really enjoyed watching the characters work together, overcome their fears, and generally be friends. Overall we really liked it, and I'll be pulling it out again soon to see how she enjoys it with a few more months' maturity under her belt.",1476748800,,688,4.6016260162601625

My 3 year old son is also entertained and doesn't think of it as a ""girls"" movie. This was a great purchase.",1475452800,,447,4.463414634146342
7697331,4,B01D55N0B2,"Since DC was cancelling shows like Young Justice when they found out that it was largely being watched by girls instead of their target audience of boys, it was later decided for them to follow the path that Monster High School did and created an animates series specifically for the young girls demographic. DC Super Hero Girls takes place in a completely different reality where a lot of the regular DC Comics heroes and villains alike are teenagers and go to Super Hero High School. It starts out with a teenage Wonder Woman(meaning there's no Wonder Girl here!)first attending SHHS, and becoming roommates with a good guy version of Harley Quinn. From there, it's introducing new characters to the roster like Supergirl and Batgirl, who get more airtime in the Super Hero High TV special that was shown on Boomerang in spring of 2016, although it has as yet to be released on DVD or Blu-Ray prior to this made-for-video movie.

Hero Of The Year starts out sometime after the Super Hero High special, with Big Barda becoming a reformed villain from Apocalypse which attacked the school in the previous story(meaning this would have been more helpful to put the special on video prior to this movie to develop a more established continuity). The campus is currently in a buzz for its annual Hero Of The Year award, Wonder Woman looking likely to win. Meanwhile, a female version of Eclipso and Dark Opal are outcasted from Gemworld by Princess Amethyst(who got her own anime-styled mini series from the DC Nation shorts), and steal various items of precious minerals to forge a powerful staff to take over the universe. Using their shadow-like creatures, Dark Opal and Eclipso kidnap an alchemist from Paradise Island to forge the minerals together, but they need a special crystal that Supergirl has from Krypton in order to make the staff whole. After kidnapping the parents of DC's all girl version of the Trinity to gain Supergirl's crystal, Eclipso uses the staff to try and conquer Super Hero High during their award's ceremony. However, her plans are ultimately thwarted by Teen Titan-regular Bumblebee, despite the fact that she was stuck in micro-mode during most of the movie. Eclipso isn't totally out of business yet as it appears her own evil-powered diamond survived the ordeal, laying plans for a possible sequal, plus hopefully adding Princess Amethyst to the DC Super Hero Girls roster!

This movie played out as an appreciative effort from Warner Bros. Animation to appeal to the female fan market, but also pays some fair homage to longtime DC Comics fans. There's a lot of voice over fan service with actors like Tara Strong back as Harley Quinn, Grey Griffin again as Wonder Woman, John DiMaggio as ""Vice-Principal"" Grodd(who might be on Principal Waller's Suicide Squad!), plus former-Supergirl Helen Slater as Martha Kent and former-Superman Dean Cain as Johnathon Kent. It's worth giving a watch for most comic fans, even if it is just playing on Cartoon Network.",1475366400,,2989,4.952191235059761
