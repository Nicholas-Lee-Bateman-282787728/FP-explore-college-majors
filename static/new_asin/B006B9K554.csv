We have viewed it at least 15 times to gleen the story and HOW WE COULD use this in present day to help the teens and young adults in our class, and on probation for one sort of crime or another, to loo at their own life.  WE FOUND IT.  The story of what these veterans, as young men and teenagers, endured.. not just off the coast of JAPAN.. but afterwards in life.. was inspiring.  They were wrong for things that were not so by a self-centered Captain.  Always looking to blame others for his mistakes.  Besides a increible history lesson about sacrifice, courage and valor... the story shows these young people that these men were unjustly accussed for 60 years... where as they are in the Drag School classroom because they 'did deserve' the probation and sentence they got.  It puts things in perspective for them and they begin to look at themselves for their situation.. not others.  THANK YOU USS FRANKLIN survivors for teling your story!

I am an avid WW2 history buff (though by no means an expert), and have been since I could first read - my first books were about WW2, from my dad, a Marine.

I knew all too well about the general facts surrounding the attacks against the USS Franklin (the pictures are, of course, in most any book you'll find about kamakazies), but I had no idea about the negligence of the skipper, nor his absurd efforts to potentially court martial the crew who entered the water. That, and his childish establishment of the 704 Club (if I remember the number correctly). That guy should have been court martialed - but, as it too often is, the officer gets away with it, and just gets shore duty.

Definitely a tale of true heroism and of true tragedy.",1426896000,10,828,4.506666666666667

He was a wonderful man who carried with him the humiliation (of the skipper at the time he that shan't be named) of having been singled out along with his other buddies for desertion. The charges were dropped, but that group of men were treated as lepers and unfortunately were never totally vindicated. Thank goodness he participated in the movie along with others that shared his fate to explain what was going on that complicated day. These weren't guys who shunned away from battle, they simply had to make a decision or be cooked alive. They saw what they thought were officers jumping over the side, but in reality were enlisted men who had grabbed officers extra clothing to replace their water/chemical laced clothing. They jumped out of gun turrets heated to near boiling temperatures. They had been called to general quarters 20 times in 12 hrs. They were beat before the attack. Ask the captain why all those of men died in the hangar waiting for food when they were 50 miles off the Japanese coast! The captain was a Navy Pilot not a boat captain. He berated the crew the first day he was aboard for the first kamikaze attack. Quite a bad man who should never have been in charge of anything. Afterwards, he was shipped off somewhere and never heard from again.",1425945600,6,1338,4.556016597510373

There is one glaring exception, the man in charge named Captain Gehres.  Based on the content of this documentary, he was singularly responsible for the deaths of over 900 sailors.  He should never have been granted that rank, and once granted he should never have been made responsible for men or ships. It is a disgrace to the Navy that he was awarded anything at all.  The first rule of all bureaucracies it to protect itself at any cost.  And in order to do that the Navy ""promoted"" Gehres out of his job and in to one where he couldn't do any more harm.  The only thing he should have been awarded was 50 years in a Navy brig. This white wash has been so effective there are still glowing tributes to him on the web today.

planes and had gotten about 15 planes off the deck  when Captain Gehres decided to let the crew go to breakfast and put the
ship on relaxed condition 3.  We were warned that an enemy plane was approaching but the captain ignored  this report even after
more than one ship had reported the Bogey  The ship was wide open when we got hit with two 500Lb bombs and all the planes
on the deck and hanger caught on fire and blew up .  Over 800 men were killed and about 1500 men were forced over the side
because of the flames.  Captain Gehres tried to charge any one who left the ship as deserters and many men went to their
grave believing this as it took a long time before the charges were dropped.  Thanks to Joe Springer the true story is told in
this excellent DVD  Robert C.Mallgraf  RT3/c  Plank owner and Grateful survivor USS Franklin  CV13",1397520000,11,1089,4.300492610837439

4982131,5,B006B9K554,"This is the most general, refreshed account by former crew members of the horrifying last-minute attack by the Japanese to sink the USS Franklin late in the war 60 miles from Japan. It includes the untold scandal involving black-balled crewmen who were wrongly accused of cowardice, that were treated unfairly instead of as heroes under difficult circumstances. For the most part, the color footage (some from ""The Saga of the USS Franklin"") adds to the searing, savagery of the attack. Like a good John Wayne film, the camaraderie of the crew allows the Franklin to avoid a sad demise. In one hour you will see what America's Can-Do spirit does in its darkest hour and in the process why the USS Franklin was deservedly the most decorated crew and ship in naval history.",1390867200,,771,4.804511278195489
4982132,5,B006B9K554,This was one of the better documentaries I have watched. It had a good balance of eyewitness accounts accompanied by video footage that I've not seen before.  Also most importantly it tells much more of a story about the ship and it's crew than I knew before. I wish more documentaries were made like this..........Must watch for  those who relish knowing our history as Americans,1390867200,2,380,4.8307692307692305
4982133,5,B006B9K554,"As a former blue water surface weapons fire control technician, I found the entire story riveting. My heart and admiration go out to all the sailors and their families that made such tremendous sacrifices in order to save the ship. I am very saddened by the actions of a naval captain who obviously should have been court-martialed himself for behavior unbecoming a US Navy Officer.  To think that the captain never ordered GQ at such a critical time when safety of the ship and crew were in harm's way.  I would hold the captain personally responsible for the massive loss of life, injuries, and destruction of government property.

The serious attack on the Franklin could have been avoided if the captain had actually demonstrated leadership instead of being so caught up in his own skin.  He appears to be a legend in his own mind!

The entire crew of the Franklin deserve the highest honors of the USN.  The captain should have been dishonorably discharged!",1390003200,2,962,4.8
4982134,5,B006B9K554,"My dad served on the Franklin and a lot of the history died with him.  All that I remember is how much he hated the captain of the ship and how he had been treated for saving his life plus the lives of others.  She was quite a ship, but what made her so great was those that served on her.  Wonderful documentary.",1389312000,2,313,3.9365079365079363
4982135,4,B006B9K554,"The story of the Franklin is actually two stories and these two stories should, absolutely, be told separately. One story, the best story, is one of heroism and self sacrifice. The other, the lesser story, is one of a man, guilty in my estimation of several court martial-able offences, who distracts the navies notice with that old magicians trick, misdirection. Simply, for me, they should have left out the captains story. The captains personal story of incompetence and pettiness, mingled with the magnificent story of a ships company fighting to save their ship and each others lives, like candy and pickles eaten together, left a bad taste in the mouth.
Just have two stories. Have one story about that ""best story"" I mentioned and another about the ""How the hell did the captain get away with that?"" story.
By the way, that best story? It's a great, elevating story, that I enjoyed learning about very much..",1388448000,,915,4.871794871794871

4982137,5,B006B9K554,"An emotional bit of history.  Could it have turned out differently?  One wonders.  This is the most detailed accounting of this tragedy ever made for film.  There must be many more such historical episodes that lend them selves to history detail.  This is a great example.  Perhaps a more balanced view of the captain could be possible.  To get to his advanced rank, he must have done some good somewhere.  It was wonderful to see many of the people who wee actually their speak on film.

4982146,5,B006B9K554,"For anyone interested in World War II Naval/Military history, this serves as an exceptionally well presented documentary within the Pacific Theater. To recognize the courage and dedication to duty of these men has been preserved in a poignant and personal way that recreates a definitive naval action.  If one chooses to read the history of the USS Franklin and her men, their courage only serves as a counterbalance to the injustices suffered by some crew members. With time and research, their actions have been vindicated  and blame assigned to the commander's inability to recognize the importance of a Naval Commander's respect for his crew, decisions made and actions taken.

The cinematography is above average for original footage and the incorporated interviews (with real time photographs) allows for smooth transitions without detractions.

Please I am not here to offend anyone, but their are people in control of other lives when they are in command. There are good Commanding Officers and bad Commanding Officers.

Excellent backstory and build to the main ""meat"" of the subject.  I felt all the information given was pertinent to the events with no added fluff. The archival war footage was paired very well with the survivor's accounts during their interviews and it appears that actual footage of the events was used whenever possible, unlike many war doc's that seem to use the same old kamikaze/explosion/damage scenes repeatedly. The producers picked the perfect narrator who's credentials add believability and reliability to the story being told. The ending was satisfying and leaves the viewer feeling like he now knows the whole story, even if bittersweet.

I heard this story growing up.  My Dad was stationed on the USS Santa Fe, the light cruiser that rescued over 800 sailors off the Franklin and bravely helped put out the fires.  What that cruel and incompetent Captain did to those brave men was criminal.  He should have been prosecuted and punished severely.  He was responsible for the deaths and injuries (both physical and mental) to all those sailors under his command.  Those men were heroes.  I recommend the book entitled ""the Lucky Lady"" written by a Santa Fe crewman.  This book tells the Franklin's story in great detail.  It was riveting!

The video is amazing and credit for the footage is given to the camera man from another ship who filmed from his ship and later boarded the Franklin to get more video and photos. I have newspaper reports from when he returned home and the story was printed from his own words in local papers. I have purchased a book and a video off Amazon, about this. I am amazed when I see movies about what men went through during service to the USA. Having my father as one of these men, who went through such a terrible and horrible experience, and lived while 800+ others died gives me great pause...and awe.  I can only thank God in His providence to have let my dad live....",1503964800,8,796,4.2026143790849675
