As a Brit married to a Peruvian, I was aware but didn't really get into them until sustained viewings whilst on separate holidays in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. There are some great TV channels out there that are constantly showing ""golden age"" movies.
I can't really add anything to the knowledgeable reviews already published except to say that these are great movies in their own right and are certainly not imitations of the Hollywood of that age.
Pedro Infante was always terrific (and some singer too!).
The DVDs generally have very good extras though don't expect perfect English sub-titles!
Any movie buff should have some of these in their collection. Me, I'm going to collect the lot!",1331769600,,785,4.909774436090226

477763,5,630249933X,ME ENCANTO ESTA PELICULA. ES TAN DIVERTIDA. PEDRO INFANTE COMO SIEMPRE ISO TREMENDO TRABAJO. SI PUDIERA DARLE 10 ESTRELLAS LO HARIA.,1081814400,6,132,5.333333333333333
477764,5,630249933X,"Made in 1946, this is one of the best slapstick comedies ever, starting from the first scene with the cigar smoking grandmother, played to the max by Sara Garcia, who's comedic timing is perfection. The way she wields her cane will have you howling with laughter.
Pedro Infante is also marvelous and funny as her tequila drinking grandson, and so are Abel Salazar as his gentle, poor brother, and Victor Manuel Mendoza as his vain, rich one. The trios they sing are a delight. I especially like the ""Cielito Lindo""...it's a lovely rendition of this favorite song.
The charro/bullfighting scene is sensational, and the sepia toned cinematography wonderful. Though it has an occasional line going through it in the first part of the film, it's amazingly clear...and you'll be so amused that you'll forget that your're watching a film that's nearly 55 years old. If nothing else but to see these hilarious performances (oh ! Sara is a jewel !) this is one not to miss.",977270400,14,965,4.819277108433735

It is great that we can watch it on demand because with a couple of clicks we are enjoying a funny, classical and family movie full of Mexican traditions and costumes that for some people will bring back memories for others will help to get knowledge of their parents/grandparents background.
