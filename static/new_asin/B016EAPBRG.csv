7470952,5,B016EAPBRG,"I will start by saying that I have every single DVD that Raviana have put out.  This one is in a category all its own!  Truly amazing!  Ecstasy is the perfect word to describe how you will feel after doing this practice.  I have done it 5 times now, and each time it is better than the last.  I love this so, so, so much.  You will too I promise!!",1446076800,19,347,3.8857142857142857
7470953,5,B016EAPBRG,I always love the music on the raviana DVDs but this time they have outdone themselves! I also love the fact that they come up with new stuff constantly so my workouts never get boring. This is the perfect later afternoon / before bed practice because it leaves you inspired and buzzed but also relaxed and happy.,1470268800,2,313,4.508771929824562
7470954,5,B016EAPBRG,"I have never been a meditation person but, I just started with this dvd last week and was having so much fun that I let it play and ended up doing the Gyan Chakra kriya (partially as my arms were killing me and this one is all about the arms!!). About half an hour after having completed my practice I noticed I was feeling soo soo good!! Just lighter and I felt like the cells in my body were humming.  I couldn't wait to do it again the next day and the next.  I just felt like I was on this natural high all the time - without doing the whole DVD. I just pick one or two sets now and do 3 minutes of the Gyan Chakra ( its 11 minutes total but I am only able to keep my arms moving for 3 right now).  The most amazing change however has been that all kinds of people just gravitate more towards me. Its as if I was walking around with a beam of light or something and feel like a positive magnet where nice things just seem to ""happen"".  I wish I could describe it better but, it is such a foreceful and dynamic feeling - actually not a feeling but I feel as if I have entered some magical realm with so many wonderful doors opening up that I felt compelled to write a review. Mind you I am someone who used to walk out of most of my kundalini yoga classes (I would only go so as not to disappoint my friend who would invite me to attend but ten minutes on and out I would go).  Anyhow my point if you haven't done kundalini yoga before please don't let the ""weirdness"" factor deter you.  This yoga works on so many levels and so quickly that it will take you on a path to abundance.",1470182400,8,1585,3.9529780564263324
7470955,3,B016EAPBRG,"I have all of Ana & Ravi's dvds at this stage and there's no doubt that both Ana & Ravi are exceptional at what they do. I've practiced yoga for 15 years now and it has been a total blessing to me but discovering  kundalini (about 7 years ago) was a massive step up for my practice.  So why did I only give this DVD 3 stars? Simple, the vocals are really grating on the nerves, in particular the male vocalist! The song at the end (during shavasana) is fine in terms of lyrics but the voice is just so awful! If you're thinking of buying this one try and listen to the songs first on youtube before you do!  I love the actual practice though and wish that Ana & Ravi take mercy on our ears in future!",1459987200,9,700,4.0215827338129495
7470956,5,B016EAPBRG,I have all of Ana and Ravis DVDS.  This new one is exceptional.  I rotate them daily.,1456790400,4,85,3.9411764705882355
7470957,1,B016EAPBRG,"I've been doing Ana & Ravi's dvd's for 12 years. I'm also a former ballet dancer. So I can work with any music and background, and I consider Ana's outfits cute and her hair color HER BUSINESS.
HOWEVER, the number one complaint they seem to get (which they never pay a wit of attention to) are the arm exercises that go on FORRREVERRR. This is why no one likes the Ringing of the Bells dvd either.
I couldn't move my neck or shoulders for two days after this one. This and Hip Bliss are the only ones that have sent me running to the chiropractor. Could be where I am in my own fitness but I simply hated this one.
Skip it. Do Green Heart Energy or Fat Free.",1454544000,19,658,4.108527131782946
7470958,5,B016EAPBRG,Another wonderful DVD by Ana and Ravi!,1453680000,2,38,4.571428571428571
7470959,5,B016EAPBRG,"Love this.  I own several dvds from RaviAna and this one is great with the time restraints a lot of people may have.  I really LOVE the two meditations at the end.  I do agree with the other reviewers that stated the voice over is not loud enough.  However,  this is trivial and can be fixed.",1453161600,5,292,4.142857142857143
7470960,5,B016EAPBRG,"Initially, I brought this DVD at raviana.com and my debit card was charged for the purchase but I never received the DVD or a refund despite numerous e-mail on the 'contact us' section on the above website.  However, I love their DVDs so I brought it again (and paid again) this time from amazon.
I love this DVD!  They have gone back to their original background format of plain white walls with just Ana on a yoga mat.  In my opinion, most of the more recent DVDs the background is to busy for my tastes.  So I loved the return of the simplicity of the white walls.
The exercises are great and easy for me to do (at my own pace).
Of special note- The music is a bit cranked up during the poses, but lessens during the instruction.  I loved this feature because I love the music but some people may find this annoying.
Also Ana is looking very thin in this one - in a I do a bunch of yoga and I'm a vegan kind of way- could be distracting for some.
Overall another great DVD!",1450915200,16,976,4.142857142857143
7470961,5,B016EAPBRG,Love it!,1450656000,,8,3.5
7470962,4,B016EAPBRG,"I'm a huge Ravi and Ana fan! They are known for their talent and creativity by merging modern and ancient and one way they do that is thru the music accompanying the practice they teach.  This particular DVD was pretty heavy on the music and it was actually distracting to my practice. I wish there was an option to turn off the music because there were some ""new to me"" postures or moves.  It seems like the music could even be a separate project bc it really is cool and fun to listen to... I just found it distracting on this particular DVD.",1447459200,15,544,4.271844660194175
8736383,5,B016EAPBRG,"This is a great DVD offering, as the title tells us, a number of short kundalini sets. The overall vibe is a nice mix of the energetic and the serene but I guess you could say that about a lot of their DVDs.
As usual we start with Warm-Ups (6.38). There are spinal flexes while sitting on your heels, then a sweeping and twisting upward arm movement (still seated), then you lie on your back and alternately raise opposite arms and legs. This last one's on their PM DVD but here it's initially done in a slowed-down, segmented way, before speeding up to do it with breath of fire.
Next is Let the Sun Shine In (17:14) for relaxation and metabolism. This one has a focus on the navel and also some alternate nostril breathing exercises.
Next it's Look Young Forever (6.26) where you repeatedly move from sitting on your heels to a variant of camel and back again, followed by a throat chakra exercise where you alternately move your chin forward and tuck it back while your arms are rounded up over your head (this one is also on Bliss Hips).
The next set is Crossing the Ocean of Your Own Limitations (11.07). Sitting crosslegged you make swimming motions with your arms. This is one of those exercises like Ringing the Bells of Heaven or Tiger Claws that goes on for a lo-o-nn-ng time. Then a variation of bridge pose, followed by another seated kriya with floating, free-form arm movements.
Next is Let Yourself Be Free (11.36), a set to overcome obsessive, compulsive and addictive behaviour. 'Let's turn the tables on all that,' says Ravi, setting the tone for the kind of encouragement he gives throughout this set. First you sit crosslegged, hands behind your head and do breath of fire through puckered lips for quite a while. Then you clasp your hands over your sternum for another breathing exercise. Then a seated up-and-down arm movement for a few minutes followed by some meditation.
After that it's Deep Relaxation and then Gyan Chakra Kriya which is another long repeated arm movement sequence that I haven't tried yet. Then there's a meditation: Chant for Guidance. This one's lovely - you put your hands on your heart and sing a mantra. Ana sings along in a touchingly heartfelt way.
The final two items on the menu are 'Dance On', where you can dance along with Ana if you wish and a Breath Primer.
I loved the music on this - I get sick of the floaty-flutey stuff on a lot of yoga DVDs and always appreciate Raviana's more vibrant musical choices. Ana seems a bit more serious and mature on this one, while still being as lithe and radiant as ever.
I bought this a while ago and somehow it got pushed to the back of the drawer I keep my fitness DVDs in and forgotten about. I'm very glad I retrieved it - it's a top-notch Kundalini mix packaged into short bursts for busy people. I'm looking forward to getting a lot of benefit and enjoyment from it.",1530835200,,2868,4.538610038610039
8736384,2,B016EAPBRG,"I have every one of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs for Kundalini yoga and I am a great fan. I don't much like on their rock-on Kundalini sound tracks on a few of their previous DVDs, but this one is the absolute worst to me. Too grating, too atonal, too loud, and no offense but the guy's voice during shavasana is so irritating (and out of tune!) that it makes me pray that corpse pose ends soon. The yoga poses are ok.",1529625600,,411,4.08641975308642
8736385,5,B016EAPBRG,Wow Wow Wow! I am unsure why there are so less review's about this dvd. I love this Dvd and have enjoyed working out doing this set. I am sooo looking forward to my their new dvd (Not sure when we can expect that ). Ana and Ravi hope you are listening :) Sat Nam!,1526688000,,263,3.8
8736386,5,B016EAPBRG,"As other reviewers have noted, there are some long sets on this DVD. Don't be scared- they are great! I've been doing Raviana DVDs since 2010 and have come to appreciate how much impact they have on shifting my general outlook.  I used to dread the long sets, but now, as another reviewer noted, I've come to appreciate them for the deep peace that comes when you are done. The ""swim"" workout, breathing through gritted teeth, is sublime- I feel like a big shark and it never fails to boost my mood. The Gyan Chakra is also awesome. I actually like to switch the order and do it before cooling down, as I find it's more comfortable and relaxing with warm shoulders, and is easy to switch with the matrix programmer. I also personally benefit from some forward bending after all the upper body work, so I like to add in a bit of that too.

I woke up this morning with tight arms and shoulders from too much time in front of the computer, but after doing this workout I feel unkinked, less sore, and can't get the grin off my face. Thank you Ana and Ravi!",1517443200,,1053,4.313131313131313
8736387,3,B016EAPBRG,"Let me preface by saying that I love Ravi and Ana -- theirs is the only exercise program that I have ever stuck with. Since I discovered them in 2011, I have been happier and fitter than ever before in my life. I have all their DVDs and I will keep buying them, also very excited about the upcoming book. Because of them, I now own (and use!) many other kundalini yoga videos and some books too -- including two of Ravi's early books, which I managed to hunt down.

Having said all this, and emphasizing that I do recommend all the Raviana DVDs heartily, I say to you: begin the collection in the beginning, with the older DVDs where Ana has dark hair. I am very firmly in the camp of those who say that the earlier DVDs were much better. Ana's bleached hair and her current extremely thin physique are the least of my concerns, however I did see something very wholesome, natural and inspiring in the brunette Ana that is missing from her current over-stylized, plastic and ""Instagrammy"" image.

A couple of things bother me a lot about this DVD. One is the unbalanced nature of the exercises. There are three different exercises where we are expected to keep moving our arms over our heads for about 10 minutes each time. This is way too long for me and looking at the reviews I am not the only one who can't or won't go through this. One of the things I really appreciate about most kundalini yoga videos I have is that, no matter how challenging an exercise is, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel because you're only looking at about 2 minutes per exercise. Not so here.

Another thing that bothers me a lot is the out-of-control loud and jarring music in this DVD. I am not sure Ravi and Ana appreciate to which degree most of us need calmness and relaxation and turn to yoga for this reason. There is a techno-folk-ethnic fusion vibe going on here that is just way too jolting for me. The sound mix is off too, and most of the time I can't make out the instruction through the racket. I can faintly hear what I am sure are pearls of wisdom from Ravi, but I can't actually understand what is being said. The best I can do with this is to use the irritating music as an opportunity to practice patience and detachment. Or I may just turn the sound off next time and play something soulful and relaxing, and skip the three crazy-long arm exercises.

I keep wistfully reminiscing about the beautiful, soothing and mysterious flute music of early DVDs like Journey through the Chakras and Fat Free - Lose Weight. There was a Native American influence to some of that music and it was just stunning and deeply relaxing. I really hope Ravi and Ana can find their way back to something like that.

On the plus side, this DVD revisits the plain white background of the earlier videos -- no more fake nature cut-outs or plastic Buddhas, yeah! Also, other than the long arm raises sequences, the kriyas are energizing, fun and doable while providing excellent exercise and the multidimensional benefits of kundalini yoga.

All in all, I look forward to whatever Ana and Ravi will bring us in the next DVD and can't wait for the book to come out!",1515456000,5,3152,4.425862068965517
8736388,3,B016EAPBRG,"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Ravi and Ana and have all of their DVDs. They are popular due to a wealth of motivating and healing Kundalini practices accompanied by beautiful music and vocals. As others have mentioned - some of the vocals and music on this DVD are grating.  The worst offenders are a manic woman chanting sa Ta NA MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!! during  lovely yoga sets. :( The song for deep relaxation is anything but relaxing - it is loud and jarring. I hope in the future Ravi and Ana will go back to their usual instrumentals, Indian music, WHA! and Kundalini vocal artists, or even simply Ana's lovely voice.

That said - there are enjoyable music sets incorporate throughout, and the yoga sets themselves are feel-good and fun. I love the return to the white background. One can never go wrong with Ana's demonstrations and instruction, and Ravi's soothing voice and poetic dialogue. I still recommend it for the yoga itself.",1487116800,4,966,4.807228915662651
8736389,5,B016EAPBRG,"Just got this from Amazon and did for the first time.  I loved it!  ESPECIALLY THE MUSIC, the beats and chants free up your mind to get fully into the poses and breathing.  I'll use this DVD over and over when I want a yoga fix but don't have a lot of time.  I have almost all of Anna and Ravi's kundalini yoga dvd's.  Fat Free Yoga was my very first purchase back in 2012 and has been my all time favorite.  Pretty sure Short Sets for Inspiration and Ectasy is going to move into the number 2 slot really fast.  I ended this practice dancing along with Anna feeling super happy and joyful.",1486857600,4,590,4.12280701754386
8736390,1,B016EAPBRG,"As if something has changed, but not for good. I am from Germany and I have ALL their DVDs, I love most of them, some poses in some DVDs are kept for too long as in this one, too, I loose interest and have no fun. I also do not like the music of the new one, the whole DVD is less professional than the older ones, the poses seem like they had no new ideas and looked for ""something new"". A lot of breathing through an open mouth (""cool breath"") which I do not like and Ana is extremely thin. Do they have new production people? Everything is so different in the DVD, but not better unfortunately, I was really disappointed, too. Anyway, I recommed most of the older DVDs, even the first ones, from t,he new ones, I really love Green Energy a lot. I miss their mountain Background, too ;-) I also recommend Ultimate Strech, Lose Weight, Fat Free, For Beginners and Beyond, Beauty Body, AM/PM, Transformer, Cleanse, Lighten Up, all others might be too hard and some as Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance also with some poses kept for too long. While writing I notice, I still love them ;-)",1479513600,10,1086,4.302439024390244
8736391,5,B016EAPBRG,"I have been doing yoga on and off for 16 years.  Ana and Ravi's DVDs are what introduced me to kundalini yoga and re-inspired me to practice.  So needless to say, I am a fan.  That being said, there are some DVDs I like more than others and some that I use for different purposes.  Some of my favorite DVDs are The Body Electric, Warrior Workout, and Kundalini Yoga Flow Bootcamp.  I also find that these give me the best workout.  My favorites for centering myself and tuning into my heart include Green Energy of the Heart, Transformer, and this one, Short Sets for Inspiration and Ecstasy.

Many of Ana and Ravi's routines include at least one sequence that is done for a long duration (about 5-10 minutes), usually with breath of fire.  These sequences are challenging but also rewarding.  Usually at the end of a long sequence I can feel my whole nervous system as I'm brought to a deeper level of relaxation.  These long sequences are one of the reasons I love kundalini yoga.  This DVD includes two long sequences and both are arm exercises.  Therefore, if you have shoulder or upper back issues, I'd imagine should take care that the long sequences don't cause your upper back and shoulder area to tighten.  One of the long sequences is at the very end of the DVD, so if your neck, shoulders, or upper back feel strained or tight at the end of the workout, you could always skip the last sequence.

As always, most of the exercises are followed by a moment of reflection/meditation to allow your body to integrate the exercise.  Those moments always feel incredible and help me understand why I exercise.

If this DVD is missing anything, it's the standing sequences that really get your heart rate up.  It's still a good workout that covers all parts of the body, but it won't get your energy flowing like some of their other DVDs.  That being said, I love doing this DVD when I'm tired or lethargic.  The energy level ramps up slowly and I get just enough work out that I feel satisfied.  Another thing that struck me about this DVD was the selection of music.  Many of the songs have vocals and the mood of the songs varies quite a bit to match the mood of the exercises.  I happened to enjoy all of the music, but if you don't like it, it could take away from the exercises as the music is very much in the forefront on this DVD.

Summary:

This DVD includes many of the elements I love from Ana and Ravi:

 - Playful and deep at the same time
 - Not afraid to challenge you but also manages to keep the mood positive and uplifting.
 - Most of the exercises are followed by a moment of reflection/meditation to allow your body to integrate the exercise.
 - At least one long (5-10 minute) sequence that offers a unique challenge and feels incredible at the end
 - Beautiful music.  Sometimes this music includes vocals and is an integral part of the exercise, helping set the pace or keep you inspired.
 - Ana and Ravi's fun and light attitude, interspersed with introspective statements that seem to sink in more deeply thanks to the physical work of yoga

Unique features (compared with other works by Ana and Ravi):

 - All exercises are sitting, kneeling, or laying down (no standing exercises)
 - This DVD in particular really puts me in touch with my heart center and feelings of gratitude.
 - The music is even more at the forefront compared to other DVDs
 - Includes a freeform segment (seen but not common in other Raviana works)
 - Two long sequences that focus on the arms, shoulders, and upper back.

Overall, I love this DVD!",1472515200,4,3550,4.503134796238244
8736392,5,B016EAPBRG,"I just took a raviana workshop at Delta Groove Yoga in Memphis and it was amazing. This DVD is as close to a live experience as I've found. Very dynamic, very passionate, and the music rocks! No matter what state I'm in, when I do this I always feel 100% better. This dynamic duo really soars above the pack in the yoga world. Sometimes I don't feel like doing a whole hour practice. This DVD makes it easy to pick and choose segments for a 20 or 30 minute workout.",1470614400,4,465,4.177777777777778
