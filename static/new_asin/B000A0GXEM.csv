2347049,4,B000A0GXEM,"I was really torn on how to rate this workout.  Here's why:

Pros:

~The instructor gets right to the point without ""cutesy"" chatter.
~The backup workout ladies were very ""normal"" looking, not the impossibly thin, young, and perky types that drive me crazy on workout videos.
~I could feel the burn on the lower body segment--I thought it was very good.

Cons:
~The ""flex band"" included with this DVD is very short (to me, anyway), measuring just over 3 feet long.  While this length is perfect for the lower body exercises (where you tie the ends of the band together to make a loop), some people might find the use of the band for the upper body portion a bit challenging.
~The instructor doesn't stay with the beat of the music a lot of the time.  Some people aren't fazed by this kind of thing, but it seems to distract me.
~I wish more emphasis on proper form was given in this workout.  While she seems to explain some exercises pretty well, others leave you to your own best judgement.

So, all that being said, I gave it 4 stars because, much to my surprise, I feel like I really *did* get a workout.  I do think I'll be adding this one into my workout rotation, although I will be using a longer stretchie band for part of the exercises.",1245024000,,1246,4.3826086956521735
2347050,3,B000A0GXEM,This is an okay resistance training.  The instructor does good at prompting you. There were some lower body workouts that were challenging but I did not feel anything the next day from the upper body workouts. Good if you are looking for a beginnings resistance training workout.,1209686400,,279,4.9361702127659575
2347051,4,B000A0GXEM,"I had previously purchased pilates videos but never used them consistently because it was all on the mat, and I never really felt if I was doing some of the moves correctly (although the stretching was great). I really needed more movement and some cardio. I did take a class about 5 years ago that had some aerobics, basic pilates, stretching and a little kickboxing all mixed together, but with 3 kids now I just don't have time or money to take a class.

I just finished my first workout with this DVD and it was great. Very much like the class that I took with the stretching, use of jabs and punches. It was a little challenging for me at first, as the workout moves from one move right into the next. ANd you are never really standing still--when you are working the arms (biceps/triceps), you are marching or side stepping to keep the heart going. I was a little uncoordinated following some of the moves, but I know that will get better with time and more familiarity with the routine. By contrast, there was too much chatter between moves with my pilates dvds.

It looked at first like my band was shorter than what they were using in the video, but it could be because theirs are more stretched out from alot of use. One thing this video showed me is how really low my stamina is right now, and my strength too, as it was tough to do some of the arm exercises (like the bicep ones with the deep lunges). I really felt the burn in my arms and legs.

By the time I was done, it didn't seem like 30 mins. had passed. I can't wait to do this workout again!",1195430400,2,1562,4.27027027027027
2347052,4,B000A0GXEM,"This was the first time I worked out with an excercise band (I usually use hand weights) and I was surprised to find that I was sore the next day.  Very happy to find that it works either different muscles or the same muscles in a more effective way.  Whichever it is, I will continue to go back and forth between this and my other DVDS to keep from getting bored. The only thing I didn't like was that I felt like the upper body moves when the strap is held under the foot were fairly jerky instead of a smooth motion.  Maybe as I get stronger and the band stretches out a bit...",1187913600,,580,4.0701754385964914
2347053,4,B000A0GXEM,"The first impression of this workout was not a good one.  The set and instructor were a bit generic, and I did not have high hopes for the intesity level.  However, once you get into this workout, it is very good.  There are several moves that my body is not used to, which is good.  This is not the most challenging DVD, but a must have for beginners, and more specifically for those who need a very low impact workout.",1184889600,7,420,4.2125
2347054,4,B000A0GXEM,Found this to be a good workout. You can adjust the resistance by moving your hands further down on the band. I found Cindy Fox the instructor a bit annoying and her cueing is not the best if you are new to exercise videos. But the workout I felt was worth it. I will definatly keep doing it. It is a nice dvd to have in your rotation.,1172880000,5,335,3.9411764705882355
2347055,4,B000A0GXEM,"This is good for beginners who wants something challenging, but still doable.",1168300800,3,77,5.5
2347056,4,B000A0GXEM,"First of all, kudos to the marketing people: they chose an attractive model for the video cover and that's a smart move.  (Just to make it clear, the covering person does not appear at all in the video!)

The trainer, Cindy Fox, has done a great job with the flex band, which is a simple, effective and usually underrated sports equipment.  (Mind you, she's not one of those slender / petite / bony type of trainers, but who minds when the exercise is effective?)

Even though I workout every day, the exercises in this video, especially those that actually involves the band, are rather challenging - the intended muscles actually start to ""burn"" half way through and it takes enough mind to complete the whole set!

As for the cardio segments that does not use the band, you may find the choreography not as pretty as those performed by other younger, slimmer and prettier trainers, but at least these routines are very do-able and the heart keep pumping without the rate shooting to the roof.

This is a great alternative to those who have already worked with dumb bells (who probably get bored by them sometimes), especially on a holiday.  Imagine all you need to take with you is something you can pack into your pocket.

Oh, another good thing, which may not be apparent enough on the cover: the price paid for the video already includes a green low-resistance band.  This is indeed very value for money, especially for someone like me who had been tempted to get a high-resistance band, only later to find out that I'm not yet strong enough to use it in these exercises!",1161216000,19,1577,4.623655913978495
2347057,4,B000A0GXEM,"I just did The Method: Cardio Flex Band Workout. Wow! I feel WORKED, and it was only 35 minutes.  NOTE - I am 5 months pregnant, but active.  I think this would be an awesome workout for anyone.

There were 2 people besides the instructor doing the workout, and they were very quiet. Just there for the demonstration, not for conversation. One of them showed lower impact moves if the instructor went into high impact.

The instructor (I think her name is Cindy Fox) has a pretty thick New York accent that I found distracting at first, but I got over it pretty quickly, once the workout got going. I also got over the pink tones in the set and the pink accented workout clothes. I really really hate pink, so that was a hard one. Plus, the bands they used are bright pale green, so that was also a bit jarring to the eye.

Onto the workout:

Started with a Warm-up which did a good job of stretching and warming up my body.

Went onto what they called a Lower Body workout, though it mostly worked my shoulders. I guess there was some background strengthening in the lower body, but MAN - the shoulder exercises were crazy good. I like that, because my shoulders are not the strongest part of my body.

Next came the Upper Body which was mostly biceps and triceps, though it incorporated some lunges in it, too. Very good!

Then came a short Low Impact Aerobics section, without the band. This incorporated the mambo and cha cha, and in a way that didn't confuse me or make me fall flat on my face. It wasn't too challenging for aerobics-inept me, but got my heart pumping, so I would say it was very effective.

Back to the band!! The Back, Shoulders & Hips came next, and it was very good. There was a part where you tie the band in a knot and use it around your ankles like a rubber band to do some hip/leg exercises. Nice. Some of them needed some balance to do, and even big pregnant me didn't fall over, so I guess the balance I have been practicing in yoga is good!!

The band went away for the rest of the workout... Abs with Jabs and Punches came next. It was a good standing ab workout, which I like, since I can't lie down!! You also work your arms with some punches and jabs, and your legs with some mini-squats (""under the rope""). Overall, good.

The Cooldown/Stretch was also really good. One thing I liked is that they include a hip stretch, which I can always use. My hips get tight really easily. And I never remember to stretch them on my own!!!!

Anyhow, if you have an exercise band, and don't know quite what to do with it, this workout is a really good one. Not too long, and both tones and gets some cardio in. I was sweating by the end, andI know my shoulders will feel this later!! PLUS - no lying down, so I could do the whole workout. (You are not supposed to exercise on your back after the first trimester of pregnancy.)

Recommended!!!

8071564,4,B000A0GXEM,"I am using this workout while I have a knee injury.  I do the upper body work, and it has kept me from deconditioning completely as I recover.  For me, the bands work better to prevent back pain than small weights.",1509321600,,214,4.195121951219512
8071565,5,B000A0GXEM,"Great workout!  I am almost 50 but in good health and average body weight. This is a doable video with specific directions using bands for most of the routines. It addresses strength, balance, and cardio. I was sore the next day, but felt great.  Because she explains everything, it seems a little slow the first time, but once you know what she's doing, you can just do the exercise while she explains it so you have a fluid routine. Definitely worth the money!",1469145600,,462,4.554216867469879
8071566,3,B000A0GXEM,"This workout alternates between strength movement using a band and low impact aerobics. It's at a beginner level, although it is effective. My main problem with it is that I was bored. The pace is very slow and there's a lot of repetition.",1465948800,,239,4.5813953488372094
8071567,5,B000A0GXEM,"I hate working out and never go to the gym, but I needed a workout I could do at home after work or in the morning to tone up.  I'm really glad I bought this dvd, it really helped me get in shape and I can tell a difference when I take a 'vacation' from using it. It took me a while to get into the flow of the workout since I had never used workout dvds before, but I'm really glad I stuck with it.  I now use a medium resistance band for all the workouts except the 'loop' one. It saves me from having to tie and untie the band and I get a better workout.",1456963200,,557,3.711864406779661
8071568,5,B000A0GXEM,I enjoy use of the stretch bands and like the way the instructor conducts the lesson also.  It's just enough challenge and I can easily modify when needed.  I'm not sure why Cindy Fox wasn't pictured on the cover since she's fit and healthy-looking .,1431043200,,250,4.533333333333333
8071569,5,B000A0GXEM,i love this workout and the fact that the only equipment you need is a band and that you shipped it so fast thanks.,1394323200,,115,3.8333333333333335
8071570,4,B000A0GXEM,"the workout is easy to follow.  sometimes the instructor is monotone, but I do like the moves.  Not a high intensity workout, but you can get a pretty good stretch from this workout.  good for the money.",1393459200,,203,4.4324324324324325
8071571,1,B000A0GXEM,Thsi one was not what I expected it to be. It was too easy and way too repetitive. I am an intermediate exerciser and it didn't do anything for me. Choose this one to be easy on the joints and if you don't mind a high degree of repetition.,1388361600,,239,3.8979591836734695
8071572,4,B000A0GXEM,"I purchased this DVD to take with me on vacations/family visits, when I couldn't go to a gym.  It comes with a long band for the workout.  Its fairly basic, but you will work up a sweat.  Its very Jane Fonda style, with a lead and two participants all doing the workout to follow.  No weights are needed.  The band folds right into the DVD case.",1316476800,,345,4.166666666666667
8071573,4,B000A0GXEM,"As my time and space is limited, I need exercise dvds that are quick and efficient. This dvd met that need. It included all areas of the body and included light aerobics. The instructor is lacking on her cueing (sp?) skills but there isn't any of that crazy chatter as in other dvds. As I do not have the best balance, I use a chair to support myself when doing the leg exercises. Definitely will stay as part of my collection.",1248825600,,427,4.283950617283951
