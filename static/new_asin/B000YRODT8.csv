8345456,4,B000YRODT8,"This was quite a suspenseful gory little Slasher with an interesting storyline.
Brian Hooks was the lead in the cast of good young twenty something actors. Rutger Hauer also stars as a detective on a mission.

I had seen Brian in several urban comedy's and liked them but was a bit skeptical when he was part of production on this slasher film.
What happens is years earlier some kids play a game called 75 where you have to keep a stranger on the phone for 75 seconds without them laughing or hanging up. You have to pitch something scary or stupid, anything to keep them on the line.

Well a psycho intercepts one of the calls and comes to the home and murders all the adults during a party and one of the kids sees his parents butchered in front of him..now it's 10 years later and the kids are grown and having a party in a mansion so they decide to play 75 again..one of the 20 somethings forget to dial *67 before one of the calls and mayhem and murder begin in the shape of an axe welding maniac wearing a parka.

It was somewhat your usual slasher fare but there were elements of it that made it seem fresh. I went ahead and bought it because It's one I will watch more than once. It's low budget but doesn't give you that cheap look,the effects are well done and the lighting is very effective. I say give it a go.",1302134400,,1323,4.221343873517786
