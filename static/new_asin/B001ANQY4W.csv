8278181,5,B001ANQY4W,"I loved ""My Mummy"" so much, I bought it after renting it.  Welcome to the delightfully wacky, goof-ball universe of J. Todd Anderson and George Willeman.  This film has a singular look and sound, and my mind has been replaying many scenes for the last few days.  (God help me: two expert low-budget filmmakers from Ohio have hijacked my brain.)  I've ever seen such a smart, smart, smart film about such dumb, dumb, dumb guys.  I hope we have not seen the last of the Earl Schmelzer and Karl Futznekkkr characters.  If you are a fan of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" The Three Stooges, The Marx Brothers, ""SCTV"", the studio sketches of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" Sam Raimi's ""Crimewave"" (co-written with the Coen brothers), ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" Cosmo Kramer, Jay and Silent Bob, Monty Python, and ""Palookaville"" you'll love ""My Mummy.""  Guarantee it.",1222128000,4,847,4.881118881118881
8278182,4,B001ANQY4W,"J. Todd Anderson's second directorial debut is a raucous good time. This campy but funny movie is well worth the price of this DVD. There are zippy one-liners, homages to the Three Stooges, and some very memorable characters. If you just want to have a great movie watching experience get My Mummy.",1219622400,2,298,4.75
