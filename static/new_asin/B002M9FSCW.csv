I can't think of a stronger adjective than bad or I'd use that.  This is the absolute worst movie I've ever tried to watch.  I can't even finish it because it is that horrible.  It's like it was made by high schoolers with their mom's video camera.  I can't believe I wasted a dollar on this movie!",1264723200,,440,4.058139534883721
3951977,1,B002M9FSCW,The worst movie I've ever seen. What a waste. I wonder how much money they spend on making this movie. May be they made this movie only for fun and didn't give a s__t of the outcome.,1264636800,,182,3.945945945945946
3951978,1,B002M9FSCW,"This was the most poorly made movie i think i have ever seen.... Well we got through about 13 min of the movie and then gave up. I think they had one camera for the entire filming so you only see one angle , as if the tapped the camera to a spot and left it in one view. Also the acting made me feel like I was watching a highschool theatre show. this movie gets a negative one star!",1262390400,,383,3.8
3951979,1,B002M9FSCW,"I was a fan of Kurt Angle in the Olympics and hoped he would become and actor. He had the look and personality. Instead he went into WWE which was very disappointing.

Kurt finally gets to act in End Game. Unfortunately it is just a low-quality home movie. The story could have been interesting and it could have been interesting to see Kurt play this kind of character, however, it is very amateurish and the production values are worse than porn.

I was wondering how they got a name guy like Kurt Angle in this no budget movie so I did some research and apparently he made this with some friends from college.

End Game is a very disappointing starring debut for Kurt Angle.

By the way, they never even explained why he goes around killing women.",1261008000,,750,4.452554744525547

3951981,1,B002M9FSCW,"This movie is terrible!  I rented it and watched about five minutes before turning it off. It should be a crime to sell movies this bad. It looks like someone recorded it with a home movie camera. And the acting is the worst I've ever heard. I could make a better movie than this, and I have no experience with making movies. I'm not exaggerating.",1260576000,,347,4.338461538461538
3951982,1,B002M9FSCW,I rented this movie to watch with my wife.  We watched the first 20 minutes of the movie before turning it off.  I had to write a review on this movie to stop anyone who did not want to waste valuable time in their life.  It is the worst acting that I have ever seen.  It has rated as number one on my list as the worst movie that I ever attempted to watch.  The acting was SO horrible that it was funny.  It did not take long to realize that this movie rates at a zero star rating.  Don't waste your money or precious momemts in life on this movie.  I can't believe that anyone would waste a blank DVD to put this movie on.  I am usually open minded on movies but this movie SUCKS!,1260144000,,682,3.9197080291970803

8373626,1,B002M9FSCW,"This was....wow.  Something else, this was.  I knew going in I was not in for much.  And I enjoy a lot of movies that many find sketchy, or bad.  So when I find a movie bad, its unsettling to me. I find the good in any movie, it seems. The only good in this movie was that it ended.  I guess I liked looking at Jenna Morasca too, but I would have been fine if she had been painting a wall for 90 minutes, instead of trying to act.

Kurt Angle was shockingly bad.  So wooden. I was not expecting that, as his wrestling persona can be a quick wit, or a credible wordsmith during promos.  In the first minute I was wondering if the joke was on us, but from all accounts this was a serious attempt.  For all involved, make it your last.

So yeah, this was the worst movie I have ever seen, I believe.  Sometimes movies are so bad they are kind of good, and you want to share them with others.  If I do share this with others I will be sure to also share a case of beer so that they are still around for me to share things in the future.  There was no value to this one, none.  Thankfully the price has always been bargain bin, I just paid more for my ham and egg sandwich this morning than I did for the movie, so there's that.

So yeah, go in expecting bad. And then expect to see worse.",1382659200,,1284,3.9416342412451364
8373627,1,B002M9FSCW,"Remember the kind of porn they made back in the early days of video?  Actors who couldn't say ""hello"" and make it sound convincing; sets that looked like they were built in the corner of somebody's garage; sound quality that wasn't; clumsy camera angles that left actors stranded in midrange trying to look natural; dumb dialog; cheap music; lighting that simulated the effect of overhead florescent tubes in a Chinese laundry?  Well if you're nostalgic for all that, this is the movie for you.  But unlike the old porn, there's no nudity, no hard core ... anything but hard core boredom.  Truly the most amateurish piece of movie-making I've ever seen ... I gave up after about 20 minutes.  And, no, don't tell me it might have gotten better.  One doesn't have to eat an entire boiled egg to know that it's rotten.  I would have given this pathetic excuse for a movie no stars at all but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that.

8373628,1,B002M9FSCW,"Plan 9 From Outer Space had been crowned the worst movie ever made. END GAME, incredulsy, has dethroned and detrashed Plan 9. Wooden hesitant acting, plodding pace and an inane story caused me to END GAME early.",1316131200,,211,4.72972972972973
8373629,1,B002M9FSCW,"Astoundingly cheesy, lame and pathetic. And this coming on the heels of a previous review stating how much I enjoyed the films that had come out of the WWE. Guys like Steve Austin and Dwayne Johnson had dispelled the idea that wrestling types could be nothing more than cardboard caricatures.

Sadly, this Kurt Angle vehicle proved that my original fears were, at least in this case, correct.

This barely b-grade flick is evocative of the annual high school drama class production which we all cringed to watch in the school auditorium. 'End Game' delivered the near-perfect symbiosis of stiff wooden acting, ridiculous score, horrific costume design, derivative cinematography, and a plot that must've been written on the back of an IHOP menu.

This pile of crap would've made the Troma guys embarrassed and Golan & Globus of the Cannon Group gawk in stunned amazement.

If you went to film school for exactly one day and quit - you'd still have a leg up on Bruce Koehler, the hack that was given directorship of this cheapo monstrosity.",1300233600,6,1039,4.886363636363637
8373630,1,B002M9FSCW,"A sadistic killer is on the loose and he's very thorough about picking his victims and covering his tracks. After his first victim, he wipes out everyone else that ever knew her. If that at all sounds thrilling or interesting, that gets stomped out within the first minute.

Former Olympic gold medalist, Kurt Angle is the star of this movie and his first line was, ""It's cheap, so I can burry the body."" That one line sums up the movie perfectly. This clearly looks like it was a college project on a $1,000 budget. The credits were over in 30 seconds.

The blank expressions of the actors on the cover sum up the acting ability in this movie.
 Everyone is awkward and monotone. The best actor was a glorified extra with 4 lines. It's obvious no one had any acting experience, which can't be true considering Kurt Angle has been on television every week for the past decade.

This should have been a ""tour de force"" for Kurt. He gets to use disguises (one is a clown named Buffo), different voices, and different tense situations when dealing with cops, his victims and the roommate of the first victim who gets targeted as ""the next victim."" Unfortunately for Kurt's acting career, it's just like a mannequin with a different wig. Those tense moments I mentioned are never actually tense. It's just another scene with a pair of mannequins standing there.

Everyone that meets the killer seems to die... People that knew the first victim, an office tryst. The detective's wife is left alive. Kurt probably figured she'd die of laughter when Kurt was dressed as Buffo the clown and said, ""Hello Mrs. Burke I was hired by your daughter's dad Mr. Burke.""

When the detective's daughter is kidnapped, the 6 year old just goes right along with it. She looked bored. Then when the killer murders someone right in front of her, there is zero reaction from the girl. They mention later she's a special needs child, but in the end... want to know who puts a stop to the killer by shooting him??? I'll spoil it. The 6 year old! She was only in 4 scenes, one of which she was asleep.

Maybe she had to do it, because there's no one to cheer for in this movie. Your choices are the killer, ""the next victim"" who is a placeholder or the police detective that cheats on his wife with ""the next victim."" ""The next victim"" is very gullible and she first meets the killer when he's posing as a police detective with a trench coat disguise, and then meets him later at a bar. Maybe she was inebriated from drinking, but she ends up on a boat with him. It made me think how did we go from him meeting her at a bar to them vacationing on a boat with a man she just met? A clever twist would have been that she agreed to it knowing he was the killer so she could get revenge on him for killing her roommate so she could sleep safe at night. The police protection she was under didn't seem to mean much anyway.

The camera shots were LONG. Like one camera angle per 2 minutes. Because of this, it really felt like each scene had 2 actors standing around. That's why all other movies have different angles like tight on this actor's face, close up on that actor, have them walking as they're talking, have a slew of extras to give a set life.

Outside of the poorly delivered raunchy dialog in the first 4 minutes, there's nothing to justify an R rating. Even the warning says ""BRIEF language."" There's no blood and even the strip club scene leaves everything to your imagination.",1292198400,,3458,4.450236966824645
8373631,3,B002M9FSCW,"END GAME

When I first heard about this movie I was a bit surprised by it, Kurt Angle starring in a movie. Of course you know I had to have it so I went out and got it, actually I had a friend pick it up for me, still my money. Now I am not to sure how I should of spent that money, this film is really not what it should have been. Don't get me wrong I love Kurt Angle, he is one of the best wrestlers to ever live. I mean both in amateur and pro so he has a lot going for him, and to be honest for his first real film he is not bad [he was in a short film previous to this].

The film is about a deranged serial killer who likes trick his victims into a comfort zone with him, and then takes them out. His name is Brad Mayfield [Angle] and he has been living this life taken out female victims for his own pleasure. That is until Officer Dan Burk [Eric Wright] is assigned to the case is on the hunt for the killer. But the killer starts to hunt him back a little and even brings his family into it. As the stakes rise and the killer becomes more obsessed with the cop after him then film starts to move along.

Now let me say from the start that I was pleasantly surprised by Angle playing the killer here, it was a very villains role for him to play. With that said the cover of this film makes you thing he will be the hero or something along the lines of your typical action film a pro wrestler would star in. not the case here, and to be honest while he seems a bit wooden at times as the film goes along he quickly becomes the best actor in this film. No where near Oscar worthy but he has the potential to be real good.

As far as every one else it is kinda hit and miss and more so on the miss, Eric Wright is just straight bad. Now if he was told to do a very over the top yet wooden performance then he is the greatest actor out there. Like Angle he seems like he has some skill even to do something good acting wise but unlike Angle he doesn't really show it here. Also his character is supposed to be the hero here but he starts to cheat on his wife one of the victims after her roommate is killed early in the film.

Everyone else does alright here looking like the are just happy being in a movie, but I must say that  George Drennen did a great job here for the minute he was in it as the hotel manager. Seriously he actually acted and it is one of the better scenes in the movie. But other than that writer McCartney James should have put more time into this script, the story is good but the dialogue and character development could have been stronger. Director Bruce Koehler has some more films starring Angle coming so here's to hoping they will be better. Also to be honest this is one of those films that if you accept that it is bad then you may actually enjoy it. Also it would have been great to hear an audio commentary on this film, director, writer, producer, and star talking about it. Or any one or mix of those.",1291075200,2,2943,3.9628378378378377
8373632,1,B002M9FSCW,"KURT ANGLE ROCKS...us to sleep with his Van Diesel impersonation. The movie starts out with a great blues soundtrack and a dive hotel. I am thinking a classic Sam Spade type movie. Our villain, Kurt Angle, a WWE wrestler, is by far the best actor in this film, which should give you a heads up.

The ""actor"" who played the cop was so bad it was comical. The movie starts out with Kurt handcuffing his ""date"" to a bed then taking her from behind while suffocating her with his paw. At this point he eludes the cops who are extremely stupid. Kurt wears a peel off mask to disguise himself, but the effect is so poor, he really doesn't look much different with the mask on, less so than C. Kent and Superman.

While there are many sexual situations, there is no nudity, even in the strip joint, where customers at this Pittsburgh bar are satisfied to see women strip down to their undergarments.

The only decent dialogue was when the cop was investigating the murder at the dive hotel and talks to the manager. Cop: ""How do you know she was a prostitute?"" Manager: ""Do you think she came here for the atmosphere?"" Cop: ""Did you hear anything unusual, like loud noises?"" Manager: ""Yea. That is every night."" At this point the movie doesn't get any better. It might be a worthwhile view while being stoned with your MST buddies.",1279324800,,1324,4.485477178423237
