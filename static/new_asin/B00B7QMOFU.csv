5562340,4,B00B7QMOFU,"This three-disc DVD set contains the first 24 episodes of In Search Of, which aired in syndication in the United States during the spring and summer of 1977.  I am relying on my memory, but the episodes appear to be the original episodes aired 25 years ago.  These are not the versions edited for broadcast on the A&E Network in the early 1990s.  The episodes on the DVD set have the original theme music and intros and outros with host Leonard Nimoy.  The episodes have not undergone any significant restoration, so the video and audio quality of the episodes reflect a mid-1970s television show: It's not reference-quality, but it is sufficient to enjoy the episodes.

As a viewer who is skeptical of, but interested in, the supernatural phenomena investigated, these episodes do not provide much insight.  Many of the ""facts"" and concepts presented in the episodes are long past their expiration date and there are much better videos available that provide the modern perspective.  However, In Search Of has nostalgia value to see what the supernatural community was considering 25 years ago.  What ideas have been rejected or fallen out of favor with time, and which ideas remain?  The videos are like opening a time capsule to the mid-1970s culture.  Also, much of my enjoyment of the set comes from reminiscing about my life when I first watched the episodes, rather than the episodes themselves.

5562341,5,B00B7QMOFU,"It's been a long time since I last saw most of these episodes, other than on youtube. I think it was on A and E in the 90s and they were notably missing the original opening, which added some ambiance to the series. So I was somewhat concerned they would not hold up. Thankfully, I was wrong. There are some episodes that are somewhat odd, like the first one about 'talking' plants but again this is a series about pushing speculation to the limits and looking at things from various perspectives.

There are episodes here on Loch Ness, Bigfoot, UFOs, Dracula, Ghosts and many others, 24 in all spread over three discs.

The quality is not the greatest if you are used to watching HD. But it's most certainly better than I expected. There are no special features, which I don't really mind.

The real value of buying something like this, or any dvd or blu ray, is the rewatchability factor. If you want to see this series just once, head over to youtube and enjoy. But if you are like me, and you enjoy watching these over and over on a big screen tv, then you will invest the $17 bucks in this dvd series.

And, of course, it should be noted that Leonard Nimoy does an outstanding job with the series narration.

I am now looking forward to getting season two.",1382054400,8,1261,4.394849785407725

Don't expect today's quality for the footage, it hasn't been updated but it was a great buy.",1439683200,,264,4.0

8563696,4,B00B7QMOFU,"Maybe this is just nostalgia talking, who knows.

This show was on the air when I was in school and I tried to never miss it, a chore in an age that had no DVR's and VCR's cost hundreds of dollars. I've always been interested in unsolved mysteries and the like, possibly because I'm a child of the 70's and the 70's was THE decade for UFO's and ghosts and unsolved mysteries. This show is classic 70's and when I ordered it I was sure that after 30 years I would find it cheesy and corny and all that.

Well, I've watched four episodes now and I've found it none of those things. Does it's age show? Of course it does, from the synthesizer theme music to the interviewing techniques to the clothing. But instead of a drawback I found that one of it's charms, it is nostalgia, and it does remind me of my youth. But it's still fun to watch and yes, many of the theories presented have been discounted over the years or just seem terribly clich and hokey now but not all of them.

A good example was the episode dealing with the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, they presented three theories, one that has since been thoroughly debunked but the other two are still debated today whenever the subject comes up, more than 30 years later.

The episode on ghosts was kind of quaint and old fashioned, but it also seemed just as, if not more credible than some of the junk that's on ""reality TV"" today dealing with the same subject.

So all in all I don't think this series has aged quite as horribly as I'd expected. If you remember it from your childhood and your memories are fond ones than I highly recommend getting it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1421625600,2,1657,4.366883116883117
8563697,5,B00B7QMOFU,"Great nostalgic classic series which ushered in all the programs that we enjoy today dealing with the paranormal, like Ancient Aliens, Finding Bigfoot, Dead Files, etc. Leonard Nimoy is one of THE best narrators around.",1409529600,,219,5.285714285714286
8563698,5,B00B7QMOFU,"Fun to watch - once I started viewing I recalled watching the programs when they were first on TV.  Mr. Nimoy has a very nice voice but the background music/theme is, for me, hard to handle.  Wish they'd do an update of each episode to reflect what is now known...or thought to be known.",1407715200,,287,4.296296296296297

8563702,4,B00B7QMOFU,"We were very excited to be able to see this show again.

 Subtitles would've been nice but we didn't have too much trouble with the audio as long as we kept the volume turned up.
No care was taken to clean up the transfer which is rather sad but I suppose that would've added to the price for us in the end.

 I am in the process of returning the copy that we have received due to disc one being defective. It locks up during the ""Bermuda Triangle"" episode and the episodes following that were not watchable. In reading reviews for the complete set, I see that others have experienced various defective discs as well. Be sure to check your copy before it's too late to return / exchange.
Luckily, Amazon makes the exchange process very easy. Hopefully, the replacement copy will be ok.

UPDATE: The replacement set works just fine. Thank you, Amazon!",1388188800,5,850,4.4935064935064934
