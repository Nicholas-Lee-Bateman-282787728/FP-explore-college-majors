2826663,5,B000PMGNI6,This a good family show.  I own the whole series and enjoy watching it.  I would reccommend this program to anyone who loves good clean family entertainment.,1221004800,,157,4.777777777777778
2826664,2,B000PMGNI6,"""Road to Avonlea"" is my favorite series. Seasons 1-5 and portions of season-6 were brilliant. ""Anne of Green Gables"" was excellent. That brilliance was lost in season-7.

The charming original Cecily has been replaced. The well-liked Chef Pierre La Pierre does not appear except for 5-seconds. The well-liked original Malcom and the original Morgan Pettibone have been replaced. Sarah is squeezed into the end of the last episode as a guest at the party. The series has constantly brought in new writers and new directors, and previously was able to maintain a standard of personality, warmth, and humor in the scripts, arising from the excellent writers, Suzette Couture, Heather Conkie, and Hart Hanson. This season's scripts do not carry on that personality, warmth, and humor. Felix and Felicity seem unhappy to be here. They are very serious, in great contrast to their joy, charm, and expression as children. The episodes do not fit together. This season's scripts do not plus comedy on the same thought, or build upon a theme, each script is scattered, unfocused. Maybe the cast and crew became unhappy with new management; or like the producer, became busy elsewhere, and their thoughts were elsewhere. None of the scripts reach the level of ""excellent"" reached in earlier seasons. This season is disappointing. There is so little on TV that is good, that I give 2-stars for the wholesome format, past greatness, and the 4 pleasant episodes. However, 4-episodes, without the humor and excellence of earlier seasons, should price season-7 at $20 or less.

The ""behind-the-scenes"" is a preview of the series, ""Wind At My Back"", and some very short behind-the-scenes that you have already seen if you have bought the prior seasons' DVD's. Nothing new. Someone has truth issues.

Episodes:
1. There are no stories about Felicity and the orphanage for having devoted this whole episode to deciding to start an orphanage. Felicity's dating a new boyfriend does not work with a picture of Felicity and Gus getting married on the cover of the DVD. The episode is like talking about something that is not particularly interesting with someone you like; ok, but uneventful.
2.
Olivia and Jasper display charm, thoughtfulness, and romance in scenic surroundings; which makes the episode worthwhile. The writers should have done more stories with the established, likeable Izzy Pettibone, and Olivia and Jasper. Izzy is quite expressive, but, her boyfriend Felix is impassive (without expression). Thus, Izzy & Felix have none of the chemistry of Olivia and Jasper. Good morals between Izzy and Felix are promoted.
3.
Davey and the bad carnival people. Davey's infatuation with the carnival mermaid. Written for six year-old minds; unbelievable and mindless. None of the characters are themselves. A poor episode.
4.
Izzy's unusual Aunt comes to visit. A different Morgan Pettibone breaks believability in a story about the Pettibone family. However, this story is interesting about Izzy and her extravagant aunt who owns a shop that sells beautiful hats. Izzy's aunt believes every girl should have a beautiful hat.
5.
Aunt Abigail comes to visit. A different Malcom and Cecily break believability. If the producer was unable to acquire the original actors, he should have left these characters out entirely. The person who decided to replace well-liked actors, has likely had several divorces without a thought. The humor is unsuccessful. The story is unlikely. Some may enjoy seeing the characters they like in a script without interest.
6.
Big city Broadway songwriters come to town. The script fails to portray the songwriters likeably. Guest singers should have appeared for a musical episode fitting the theme. A better song for Alec who does sing well. Selena Dale diverts precious time from the regular characters in a promising theme that never takes off.
7.
An older, woman, guest is demanding, which fits in a story about Felix overbooking the hotel. Rather than plus this, the writer changes this woman to an end-of-the-world, crazy guest, which says we are changing the story to... confusion. An example of the otherwise excellent writer, straying from theme in a story about Felix taking on too much to handle. Promising but uneventful.
8.
Contest between schools. The episode is pleasant, but does not have the charm and humor of earlier seasons.
9.
Two orphans from England pull pranks. Constant, unpleasant disputes prevent this episode from being anything but fair. There is no balance of warmth, fun, and likeable characters.
10.
Ninety-one year-old, Great Aunt Winifred is depressed and troubled and comes to visit. A dreary story. A poor episode.
11.
Felicity and Hetty travel to South Carolina in search of Gus. Worthwhile.
12.
Two townspeople try to persuade the town of Avonlea to sell the cannery to the town of Carmody and move the school there, and move the railroad line for profit for the two. Characters we like in a story that is not bad, but not good.
13.
Felicity marries Gus. Good only because the King family and Sarah are all here, and because Gus and Felicity finally get married. Not as good as it could have been. Sarah is squeezed in at the end, as a guest at the party, in a story about others.

2826665,5,B000PMGNI6,"I kept reading the reviews and was afraid to get this set, but after seeing it, I can't belive the reviews have been so negative.  This has been delightful!!!!  It's more like the first couple of series.  It was light and cheery!  I would recomend this for any who love the fun of these shows and not fuss over where Sara and Felicity are.  I was saddened that they didn't resolve what happened to Gus' Mom, though.",1212537600,14,415,4.337662337662338
2826666,4,B000PMGNI6,"This series is wonderful! However, on this seventh season I was disappointed because Sarah is absent and we don't see very much of Felicity (on the first couple episodes and on the very last) and Gus (on the very last episode). If you go onto Netflix you'll notice that most of the reviews are all negative. I honestly think they were all exaggerating. The first six seasons were just a little better, but the seventh is still very good and touching. You definitely need this season to comlete your Avonlea series. It is still worth the money and I am very glad I invested in this one. I highly recommend this and all the other seasons!",1212364800,18,636,4.491379310344827

2826668,5,B000PMGNI6,"I loved every minute of it. It was wonderful to see Felix, Sarah, Felicity, all grown up and very mature. It was very sad to see that Gus Pike, is now blind.

6.
Big city Broadway songwriters come to town. Could have been much better, if the songwriters were portrayed more likeable. The second plot with Selena Dale is a second guest-plot, which is one too many guest-plots in a limited time, sacrificing needed depth with the regular characters. They should have brought in good singers for a musical. Needed a better song for Alec, who does sing well.

I have the whole set of the of this great show. I really liked the last two episodes of season seven because we finally get to see Gus and felicity get married the moment fans had waited for through out the whole series.

This season was different than others, being more serious, but considering certain experiences and things that happened, in normal every day life, things like this are expected.  Life threatening circumstances like Rachel Lynde endured, cause us to see little things in life more worth while, giving you a new insight of them. Felicity was encouraged by others to pursue a relationship with Stuart & she thought she could, even though her heart stayed true to Gus in the long run.  I'm not going to say anything else since some may not have seen these shows. Even if I did, though, saying something does no justice to watching the episodes. I'm just saying what I thought of it.

2826714,5,B000PMGNI6,"I love the Road to Avonlea series and watch the DVDs every year, usually around fall. I have mixed feelings about Season 7. There's not much of Hetty King in this season as other actors get more screen time, and I love Hetty (in all her infuriating righteousness). I did not care so much for the story lines involving the younger children such as Davey Keith and missed the camaraderie of the earlier seasons. Yet, this is still a good season because of the way the stories are developed and the excellent casting.

Season Seven is the concluding season of RTA and is bittersweet. Here are the episodes:
Out of the Ashes - Felicity sinks into depression over Gus; there's a new town banker Stuart Mcrae and a budding romance develops between Felicity and Stuart.
Love May be Blind...But the Neighbors Ain't - Felix and Izzy's romance gets the gossip mill going; Eulalie starts spreading rumors that the Dales' are getting a divorce.
Davey and the Mermaid - Davey gets charmed by the `mermaid' when the traveling Midway comes to Avonlea.
Woman of Importance - Izzy's Aunt Lillian conceals her failed business dealings; Izzy rebels as she feels she is being treated like a child.
Secrets and Sacrifices - Janet's annoying sister Abigail returns to Avonlea; Janet thinks her wedding ring is lost. This is a sweet and romantic episode that shows just how close Janet and Alec are.
King of the Great White Way - Alec receives an offer to perform on Broadway.
Total Eclipse - Felix gets into trouble
Ah...Sweet Mystery of Life - Hetty is given an ultimatum - teach in Carmody or resign; romance between Hetty and Simon gets serious and also faces strain.
From Away - Davey gets into trouble, as usual.
After the Ball is Over - Eliza Ward's 90th birthday celebration reveals some secrets from the past.
Return to Me - On the eve of her wedding, Felicity receives a disturbing call that makes her think Gus is alive. This takes Felicity and Hetty to South Carolina.
The Last Hurrah - the Dale cannery gets destroyed in a fire
So Dear to My Heart - Felicity chooses to marry Gus; Gus undergoes an eye surgery; Hetty boycott's the wedding.
Conclusion - Road to Avonlea is one of the best family series and period shows on television and will always remain a favorite.",1291507200,,2257,4.656641604010025
