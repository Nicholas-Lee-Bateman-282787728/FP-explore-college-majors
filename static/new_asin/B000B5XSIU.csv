8082239,1,B000B5XSIU,"I got this as a white elephant gift, and can see why someone gave it away. The routine is very redundant with hardly any variation. There are no balance poses. The instructor rarely gives breathing cues so a beginner would have no idea when to inhale or exhale. There is no shavasana. They all have poor form and some of the poses are done incorrectly. One poor girl looks as though that was the first time she had ever done yoga. She spent the whole time watching the instructor and awkwardly trying to mimic the woman. there were no blocks to show how a pose could be modified.",1423008000,,579,4.37037037037037
8082240,4,B000B5XSIU,"I actually do this DVD workout once or twice a week. It can feel repetitive at times, but in general I always feel fantastic for a day or 2 after I do it. Lariesa Bernick is rather annoying - I'm under the impression that she's having an affair with the cameraman! The Beginner Girl is horribly awkward & stiff - which makes me feel 1) sorry for her that she's actually in workout making a fool of herself, and 2) good about myself because I'm nowhere near smooth & coordinated! The Intermediate Lady in red is usually the one I watch, she has the best form of all 3 ladies.",1258243200,,574,4.2272727272727275
8082241,1,B000B5XSIU,"The good thing about this video is that the instructor doesn't waste much time with New Age mumbo jumbo about getting in tune with the universe.  Also, you don't have to wait through sales pitches, copyright notices or anything else. Press play, and the workout starts.  With three people doing the poses at the same time, you can see what the pose looks like from different angles.

Unfortunately, the instructor seems as though she was chosen for her looks rather than her ability. I found her kittenish voice, make-up, and navel piercing more suitable for a late night show than a yoga video.  I wished the athletic woman in red had been the one to conduct it. One of the girls doing the poses didn't look as though she'd ever done it before; her form was poor and she kept looking at the instructor, as though wanting guidance (which was not forthcoming.)  Also, the workout was extremely repetitive. I think there are only twelve poses in the entire video.  As a stretch, she did pigeon pose, which is quite difficult, and she didn't offer much in the way of modifications.

Because she does the same poses on the right side three times, and then on the left side three times, there's no easy way to modify this workout if you only have 15 minutes or 30 minutes, and there's no way you could really stretch it into a longer workout, because there aren't enough poses.  In short, it's boring.  Also, the video promises ""elaborate light & bright set designs"" but it's basically a theater stage with spot lights, and the background music sounds like two music boxes wound up out of sync.

If you find this on sale, you've done yoga before, and there aren't any better videos available, this is a basic 50 minute video.",1250121600,,1720,4.591503267973856
8082242,5,B000B5XSIU,I actually think this was a very challenging workout and really pushes you in a good way.  Even though it's titled as yoga basics - you will get a very challenging and effective workout.  I think the instructor is cheery but not in an obnoxious way - she gives pretty decent guidance and does remind you to breathe.  This DVD is not something I would recommend for beginners because you do need to have a certain level of good flexibility.  I am familiar with yoga so it works great for me.,1214179200,2,490,4.351648351648351
8082243,1,B000B5XSIU,"boring boring boring. too much repetition not relaxing not challenging, save your money because this is AWFUL.",1171929600,,110,5.529411764705882
8082244,2,B000B5XSIU,"When I think about a yoga routine, and what that means to me, this is definitely NOT it!  First, a yoga routine should be smooth and relaxing, even as it challenges you.  This was a jerky, repetitive, boring and stressful workout.  The trainer doesn't show the correct breathing technique, and has this annoying, nasal Valley-Girl way of talking that grated on my nerves.  It was basically the same difficult moves over and over, then as soon as I began to just repeat the same thing I'd done fifty times before again--surprise!--she'd change to a different position, so then I'd have to whip my head up, back up the DVD, and watch while they did the move, then play it back again so I could do it right.  Even the two girls exercising on the DVD looked bored, I know I was.  She used the down-dog position as a ""resting"" position, one that I find very difficult, so that I was straining away and she says ""like, remember, this is your relaxation position, so you should, like, ENJOY it"".

You should, like, save your money and get a different yoga video.",1168387200,4,1055,4.521052631578947
8082245,5,B000B5XSIU,"This workout is easy enough to follow as a beginner, but is definitely challenging! The moves are hard enough to keep me going for a very long time. Lariesa's voice is very soothing and relaxing; by the time it was over I felt rejuvinated and energized! If you're looking to gain flexibility and muscle tone, this will do the trick!",1135123200,6,332,4.55
