8738073,5,B0173UQWY2,"Hibito goes to Russia to work with Russian astronaut Ivan Tolstoy to try and overcome his panic disorder. Mutta begins NEEMO training.

This set starts with a strong focus on Hibito and his rehab. We meet some new characters and see lots of vodka drunk. Hibito makes new friends and discovers new inspiration. Then we switch back to Mutta and get introduced to the super awesome NEEMO training facility (which is on the bottom of the ocean!) and witness Mutta confronted with some difficult choices.

Every time I think this series has reached the top of its game, the next set comes along :)

This set contains episodes 76-87 (12 episodes) out 99 total.",1459814400,,654,4.719298245614035
