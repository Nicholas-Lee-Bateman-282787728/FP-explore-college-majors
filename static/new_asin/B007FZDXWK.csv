It's the time of anime that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The kind that you realize new things about everytime you watch it. I have watched it from start to finish at least 5 to 6 times. Now, this is a longer anime, keep that in mind. But, I give 5 stars. If you love romance, suspence, reverse harems, love trianges, and good fighting scenes. This may be a very good anime for you to check out. I highly recommend it!",1381276800,,620,4.3076923076923075

8516108,5,B007FZDXWK,"This actually is my favorite anime. I think the charecters were well developed there was little to no filler, and anything that was filler was done properly. I will admit that the story overall is not very believable, but none the less is well done and very aluring. I still remember crying the first time I watched it when they first released the show on Tokyo TV.",1335139200,,365,4.462686567164179
