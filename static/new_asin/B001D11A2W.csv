3521419,5,B001D11A2W,"If you are into period piece movies (even if you are not) this is a must see! It's about a young English country lady who is lured into the city by a 'so-called' friend & is soon taught the wicked ways of prostitution. It starts with her innocent, quiet & trusting in others & slowly she learns what she has become & what her life could turn out to be! This movie is meant for an older audience as there is much talk of sex & there is a fair share of nudity. Really interesting & quite funny @ times! The British sure know how to make a quality film! Enjoy!",1260835200,4,557,4.027027027027027
3521420,5,B001D11A2W,"This gorgeous adaptation of ""Fanny Hill"" starring the equally gorgeous Rebecca Night and an appropriately gorgeous supporting cast is a faithful adaptation of the book that is by turns funny, bawdy and dramatic.
The story tells, in detail, the story of country maiden Fanny's journey to London, her erotic adventures and her discovery of true love.
Whereas previous adaptations have focused on the bawdiness and gotten Fanny and everyone around her naked as quickly as possible, this shows a tad more reserve in its development of Fanny's character. While the brothel scenes all have an obligatory smattering of nudity, Fanny only reveals herself nude for the first time in her first love scene with Charles, the man who is the love of her life. The film seems to strengthen the message that while sex can be a lot of fun, true love is ultimately a virtue and a reward beyond the physical pleasures of sex.
The supporting cast, especially Alison Steadman, are suitably colourful. See this one!",1252368000,14,993,4.952095808383233

3521422,5,B001D11A2W,"This adaptation of the book was, for a tv movie, surprisingly explicit, and featured the lovely Rebecca Night (though I'd like to have seen more of her, and heard her talk less, in the movie).  She's got a nice combination of innocence and seductiveness [if I might put it that way] and she's got a lovely figure. Other characters were nice too. It's too bad I didn't see anything of Ms. Louisa Clein's figure, which was nicely displayed in Island At War.  I can tell you though, if this had run on tv (especially in Missouri) they'd have cut half of it.  Still, not bad.",1246492800,6,571,4.419047619047619
3521423,3,B001D11A2W,"Todo lo que hace la BBC es impecable y sta no es la excepcin.

Pero esta ""Fanny Hill"" es una versin muy distanciada del libro, se distorsiona la novela de John Cleland.

No la recomiendo para nada, si nunca han leido el libro o visto la otras versiones, a lo mejor les guste.  Es un noveln rosa con un ligero (muy ligero) toque picaresco.

Le doy 3 estrellas porque es de la BBC y como produccin es buena.",1244937600,,405,4.153846153846154

This movie has a little bit of everything in it.
I was never bored watching it.
Rebecca Night and Alison Steadman do not dissappoint.
Superb Acting on both their parts.
Loved the supporting cast and lovely costumes also.
It does have nudity, but the human body is a beautiful thing right? :)
If you like movies that tell a story, this ones for you.
For all I know it could've been true.
Enjoy It!",1238544000,4,533,5.7594936708860756
3521425,4,B001D11A2W,"Although John Cleland's 1748 version of  ""MEMOIRS OF A WOMAN OF PLEASURE"" was written while in prison for debt and subsequently banned in Britain for over 200 years because of its sexual theme, it has been filmed several times since the obscenity ban in the U.S. was lifted only in 1966.

What is often overlooked because of the scandalous controversy of the source material, is the drama, wit and charm and especially the feel good ending of the episodic melodrama itself.

This new to DVD version won raves when it was originally broadcast.  The Times (UK) called it ""Beautiful, sensual and extremely witty.""

Screenwriter Andrew Davis, lauded for his sexy adaptations of classics like ""Brideshead Revisited,""  ""Pride and Prejudice"" as well as pop fiction bestseller ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" does not shy away from keeping the sexuality at the forefront of Britain's first erotic novel.

Fanny -- newcomer Rebecca Night -- shines in the title role.  And we believe her as she relates her journey from wholesome innocent to worldly wise woman.  In a nutshell, the story is her journey from orphaned country girl virgin to London prostitute under an infamous madam.  In order to survive, she enthusiastically takes a series of lovers while somehow protecting her heart for her true love.

Beautifully photographed with wonderful period detail, the overt atmosphere of ever-present sensuality is still eye-brow raising but necessary for the tale.  Without the nudity and strong sexual scenes the story would not be Fanny Hill's.

James Hawkes' direction is smooth and he makes Rebecca Night's transformation from dewey country girl to wise but not hard-hearted woman believable.

This fable resonates on a lot of levels -- it's not about the beauty of prostitution and [...] with a heart of gold, but rather that anyone can be redeemed.

Extras include Behind the Scenes footage, interviews, previews etc.",1224460800,42,1903,5.153094462540716
3521426,3,B001D11A2W,It had an attractive cast especially the women but it was lacking in depth and character. The nudity was the main attraction. It was a hilarious depiction of women who were like a piece of merchandise.,1473724800,,201,4.611111111111111

3521428,3,B001D11A2W,"there was a mix up and I got charged for 2 of these and received both bit if I return it I have to pay shipping to get it there and it would be like flushing money down the toilet. had a big order using the prime I paid for a year. I placed an order and the money was on my other card and the next day I came in to fix it because i got an email saying the order had been cancelled I went to put the right info so i clicked the email link and clicked buy again since they cancelled it and it was the only choice the link gave me was to buy again if i still wanted the item and 2 days after putting my credit card info on Amazon they took the original order and charged me again and mailed out double with out asking my permission. When I was told the ordered was cancelled I assumed it meant cancelled, but to Amazon it meant pay again and send both to make double the money. The items were for my grandchild and were mailed to his mother and i asked her to return he doubles but she couldn't afford it & once I saw how much to send back I'd be paying Amazon to take it back & keep my money. It was a big order, big enough to eat up my entire Social Security check I had very little food to eat i lived on crackers mostly until my Army VA check arrived on the 1st. I to this day will never understand why once they saw I repurchased the items did they take the 1st order out of cancellation without my knowledge or permission a few days later recharged me for it all and mailed the same items to my grandson he already had. Amazon caused me to get week an very ill due to the lack of money for food or money to pay bills. I got charged many I never could get Amazon to fix it& it scares me every time i buy from Amazon, I wish I could say I'd never shop here again but I am a home bound, wheelchair bound disabled Army Veteran and I have no help only people that I have left in my life take advantage of me and steal from me, I can't make them go away because they are all i have no matter they take advantage of me & i have no one else. My mom & son are all that cared about me but they both passed away how horrible it is unfortunate I am stuck this way, I can't even bath myself or cook or clean & i am at their mercy. Then when stuff comes along like this it makes it hurt more and more. I don't understand humanity. I join the Army serve my Country and besides the check i get each month from the VA  and people nipping at my heals like dogs to take that money away too ,i lost my mom due to illness, my husband left me for a Soldiers wife that's half my age, he says he left due to wheelchair but I am not that stupid, he left for the younger woman & maybe part is due to being handicapped now. Because before I was injured that woman couldn't hold a candle to me. The woman I once was before i was injured besides being beautiful back then, I was smart independent and handled every thing but now that's gone all hats left is the dogs nipping at my heels for the little i have, all of them trying to take it all by lying, cheating me until there is nothing left. Amazon is just one of the many, and all I know to do is pray to GOD",1427241600,,3136,3.8246153846153845

3521433,4,B001D11A2W,"When I ordered, this DVD I really didn't know what the movie was about.  While it is a good story, and everything works out for Fanny, in the end, it has a little bit to much sex, and nudity in it, for me.  I think people look better, and more sexy, in clothles, But, without all the nudity, and sex, it is a cute story.  It is actually a love story, about Fannie Hill.",1362441600,,369,3.9594594594594597
3521434,4,B001D11A2W,"I had heard a lot about the real 'Fanny Hill', but had never read it John Cleland never really made any money for his efforts but a lot of lawyers have as this has been the subject of many a trial for obscenity.

It must show how far society has changed as this comes nowhere near indecent and on the 'filth' Richter scale gets about a 3.5. That said it is stupendously made and as ever with the BBC there is a great attention to period detail. I think that may be where the overall problem is, in that the grime and filth that was typical of the period it is set in, has been airbrushed out. Compare it to 'The Libertine' for example, there is muck and detritus everywhere and one gets a real sense of what 'bawdy' means, this is lacking in this production which tries and succeeds to portray a classy courtesan rather than an opportunistic upwardly mobile prostitute. And I use the word in the period sense of being a working lady and not in the modern pejorative way.",1302566400,,970,4.300546448087432

8290833,5,B001D11A2W,"This adaptation of the novel by  John Cleland, ""Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"", boasts a delightful screenplay, an excellent cast, and great cinematography. Rebecca Night is outstanding as Fanny  Hill, combining a sweet innocence and certain naivete with a lusty zest for life.

This film tells the story of Fanny Hill, a pretty, young and innocent country lass who is left to her own devices once both her parents die unexpectedly due to illness. A childhood friend takes her to London, where she promptly leaves her in a bawdy house. From there, Fanny's life careens wildly, as she finds and loses her true love, only to once again find herself back where she started.

The viewer should be aware that there is a certain amount of nudity and sexual congress, which is to be expected, given Fanny's occupation. After all, a bit of bawdiness is to be expected, when one is, after all, a bawd. This is is an amusing and witty, well-acted, succinct adaptation of the novel that beautifully captures its essence.",1501891200,2,1022,4.7897727272727275
