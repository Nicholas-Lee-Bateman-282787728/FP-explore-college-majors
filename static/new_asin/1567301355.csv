186933,5,1567301355,"Truly a chilling, and vivid account of Brazil's homeless children and teenagers. How they are used by corrupt police and other criminal organizations to commit crimes.

This stars Fernando Ramos Da Silva as your main star Pixote who sadly in real life at the age of 19 was killed by Brazilian police in So Paulo. Art sadly came true and ended in a gun shoot out. Sadly Fernando Ramos Da Silva was never able to get out of the slums in real life and seemed to become the part. Although there is a mystery behind his death. Some say he was murdered by the very corrupt police the movie showcases. He often stated that he could never get away from the image of Pixote and that the police could never differentiate his real self from his character or maybe it was him who could not.

This deals with the poverty of street children. Children that end up committing crimes because they are exploited by adults. Most once caught are sent to overcrowded dormitories where they struggle to survive.

On the outside kidnapped, they struggle to find food and are treated as sexual objects. This is a vivid depiction of the world of innocences lost.

This holds nothing back. The rape of children, the abuse of children, the lost souls. All seen through the eyes of one young boy named Pixote.

186951,3,1567301355,"The profusion of 5-stars awarded to this movie by its reviewers puzzles me. Like many of them, I too saw it when it first appeared and had sufficiently fond memories to purchase this DVD recently. Much of what I saw this time round was unfamiliar and shocking, and I can only presume that in 1981, the censors did an excellent job in protecting the artist (and his public) from his own excesses. The film cannot make up its mind about its own identity: the opening frames suggest that it is a virtual documentary but the incidents portrayed progress into the realm of the incredible and the director weakens his own case by almost turning the whole work into a fantasy. This schizophrenia seems to have touched several of its eminent reviewers; some praise its graphic truth, while others (notably Pauline Kael) were captivated by its ""magic realism"". All of this would be less contentious if the film-making was of a high artistic and poetic order, but I did not find this to be the case. Ugliness and brutality are emphasized beyond the needs required to explore this deplorable social phenomenon. How many rapes and murders does Babenco need to make his point? The movie goes on far too long and eventually becomes boring and repetitive. It is violence at its crudest, with none of the visual elegance with which Kubrick (Clockwork Orange) or Peckinpah (The Wild Ones) can present this ugly phenomenon. Nor does it possess the lyrical quality that De Sica (Shoeshine) or Bunuel (Los Olvidados) brought to their exposition of street-children. We all know from more recent events how easy it is to turn children into remorseless killers: Charles Taylor (Liberia) and Joseph Koney (Uganda) have taught us that lesson most effectively. If you give Pixote 5-stars, how many more should you give that other Brazilian film focusing on  a single street child, where every frame is filled with hope, courage, compassion, and the structural skills of a real camera artist ------ Central Station? As a piece of well-meaning propaganda, Pixote has passed its period of utility. As propaganda, it seems to have had no beneficial effect on the problem to which it was designed to draw attention, and as a work of art it is no more than passable.",1334102400,,2234,4.848167539267016
186952,5,1567301355,I ordered the film Pixote. It came incredibly quick. There were no surprises like you have to be careful about when ordering out of print foreign films (different region). It was an old New Yorker DVD that had probably been sitting on the shelf for a few years (at least since New Yorker went bust). The price was very reasonable considering this film is out of print. And did I mention that it arrived quick? At was at my door a few days after I ordered it. Good experience.,1333584000,,475,4.348314606741573
186953,5,1567301355,"A deeply disturbing and heartbreaking neo-realist film, about an abandoned, unwanted 10 year old living first in a reformatory, and then on Brazil's mean streets.

The performances Babenco gets from his non-professional cast are amazing, especially his tiny young lead.

The film almost totally avoids the twin traps of false sentimentality (although it's got plenty of emotion), or needless flashiness.  It occasionally feels aimless, but somehow, in the end,
always adds up.

Probably the weakest,  most problematic moment is the opening, where the `director' (Babenco, or an actor?) tells us that these actors are real people, gives us some facts and figures about them, and tells that their lives are much like those shown in the film.

It then took me the first few minutes of the movie to forget about that, and get involved with  the characters, and not get all intellectually caught up the artistic complexities of `real people' playing a dramatic variation on their lives.

So perhaps I don't consider this terrific, important film a 'perfect' masterpiece as so many do- but I deeply admire it and respect it, would encourage everyone to see it (though you doubtless find the experience upsetting) and look forward to seeing it a third time.  You will never be able to look at a poor kid on the street quite the same way again.

And I'm thrilled that after years of waiting, a proper 1:85 release is available.  Yes, it's DVD-R, which means it may not play on your computer, theoretically will have a shorter shelf life, and has no extras.  But after years where this important, influential film was out of print and very difficult to see - and when you could find it it was a terribly transferred 4:3 VHS based version that someone wanted $60 for - this is a big step in the right direction",1312502400,2,1800,4.808441558441558
186954,4,1567301355,"I saw this movie some twenty five years ago, and was blown away by the power of it all. But watching the film today, it seems less shocking, and somewhat edited. Perhaps my memory is failing me, or this is a different version of the movie I saw.",1300665600,,245,4.125
186955,5,1567301355,"THIS film is the real deal. In a lot of ways, it's the ultimate vision of hell. Right from the start, you feel that you're there in these slums. You can feel the poverty, you can sense the hopelessness, you can see the decadence and debauchery, you can nearly smell the sweat of desperation from these characters. It's such a hellish, intense, cruel landscape that your gut reaction is to write the film off as another examination of terrible street life. There's so much more going on here, however, and the film takes a real brave approach at getting really involved in what's going on mentally as well as from a distance. What struck me immediately, first of all, was how communicative this group of street kids are. They have mastered the art of self-confinement and survival and as a result we can understand whatever progress they make, despite how little they actually get done. These are children that have achieved a sense of personal productivity, and so it's less about being financially sound and more about surviving each day through whatever means necessary. Hygiene, fulfillment, sexuality, and structure are all completely meaningless to them. They clean themselves only when necessary, they sleep and eat only whenever they feel like it, they think nothing of two of their own being gay lovers, and time only represents a means of knowing when the coast is clear.

This portrait of street life is like no other film I have seen, and several characters end up getting killed unexpectedly in incredibly horrible ways. It's a desperate film about desperate street kids who have been forced to adapt to their way of life, despite the risks of violence, disease, police imprisonment, and betrayal. What makes it all work is the lead performance by Fernando Ramos da Silva, who was sadly murdered by police in 1987. The boy led a similar existence to the life of his character in Pixote, and you can see it in his face. He represents a sense of disembodied innocence and charisma that is startling and heartbreaking. People may not realize this, but he really is what is key to the success of the film. Pixote is a representation of what many Brazilian slum kids feel on a day to day basis, which is the desperate need and wanting to have a home and to be safe and happy and loved by someone. He is the figure that is visually telling them that they are not alone. He is, in a lot of ways, the John Wayne of Brazilian cinema. He is brave, charming, full of presence and life, fearless action, fearless emotion, and fearless innocence. He doesn't have the face of a child, he has the face of an outlaw. He is a notably damaged and unhappy child, but though he may look jaded in his face, he is certainly not jaded in his eyes, which are full of simple expression.

I think, in addition to him and his performance, the atmosphere of the film really adds to the success. Much of the film is shot with natural lighting and the camerawork uses a hell of a lot of zooms, panning shots, close-ups, and angled tilts, lending to a real documentary type of feel to the film. None of the actors are really actors, but rather actual street children, and you can totally tell. When acts of murder, rape, theft, and assault are committed they often feel all too genuine in their often confusing desperation, but the intensity of the film comes from the threat of such things rather than the acts themselves. Add to that a simple musical score that has the feel of stock documentary music found in an old library and you have a film that is as real as a film about Brazilian slum life can be without it being a documentary. It is a chilling and amazing film that blows my mind every time I watch it. Pixote is a must-see film for anyone who has a serious passion for cinema and for human life.",1296950400,,3789,4.5624082232011745
186956,5,1567301355,"Before diving into the meat of this emotionally disturbing drama, I must ask whether or not the same results could have been achieved by opting for less graphic depictions of the material presented.  Remember, this movie is about the life of a ten year old street kid named Pixote (pronounced pee-SHOT) seeing through the eyes of a ten year old street kid, and I don't think the events depicted here could be expressed any more clearly in any other way.  How are we to know how shocking his life is unless we are shocked by what he has to live through?

I finished watching this movie without thinking too much about it.  The story itself kind of drags from time to time, but I found myself still thinking about it almost a week later.  I keep thinking about Pixote's eyes.  They are so disturbed yet calm, deep yet shallow, inquisitive yet all-knowing.  When I look into those eyes, I see the soul of a child who is greatly disturbed because of sights that are not meant for a ten year old.  No actor can portray that.  We can only achieve that aura from a child who actually has seen some of the horrors that were depicted in the movie.

We follow the life of Pixote as he is first moved into a reformatory school for boys, and we follow his life as the core group of friends he becomes involved with start getting killed one-by-one as the adults who run the facilities try to save some face.  Thinking he is going to be next on the list of hits, and seeing the corruption invovled in running the facility first hand, he does what he has to do in order to survive.  So is the life of a child who has grown up all to fast.  Then, just as we are coming to accept the fact that the ten year old Pixote has developed the personality and coping mechanisms of an adult, the movie reminds us in a heavy and startling way that young Pixote is still just a child.

This is definitely not a movie for a child to be watching.  Such a statement really makes one think about the fact that we don't want our kids watching a movie about the kind of life that young Pixote was forced to live.",1264982400,3,2078,4.26530612244898
186957,5,1567301355,"Ten-year-old Pixote (Portuguese slang word for, ""PeeWee"")is one of the millions of homeless children in Brazil.

You would be surprised to know,... that the US system is not much better, today, than what is portrayed in this movie! The kids in the US judical and foster care systems are treated pretty much the same way as these kids are treated 20 years ago in a third world country! Some people may look at this film and say, "" Oh those poor kids down there in Brazil...."", but what they don't know is that nothing has changed down there and it is much the same with the kids here... in America!!!",1219795200,2,794,4.520833333333333
186958,4,1567301355,"Hector Babenco reveals in the production notes of this powerful film that he pains to see someone who is out of balance.

Pixote is a tour de force representaion of what it means to be a dirt poor orphan street child in Brazil. This is not an enjoyable film to watch. It is depressingly sad and gut wrenching to witness. And you will not feel uplifted after the end titles. It is however a necessary piece of social commentary that deals with a subject that only really gets press when poverty and wealth collide. Yes here I am talking about crime. Crime and poverty and misery and hopelessness are all really one and the same thing.

In Brazil in the 1970's following the so-called ""Brazilian economic miracle"" large amounts of cheap unskilled labour was required to keep the economic engine of growth humming along by slaving away in its factories, constructing its buildings and generally developing the foundations for megalopoli such as Rio and Sao Paulo. These cities were built on the back of this cheap labour.  The Brazilian government however never provided adequate housing and amenities to this unskilled labour force and hence the ""favela"" (slum) was born.

Pixote played by untrained child actor Fernando Ramos da Silva is the child ambassador for and metaphor of the favela child and his life aint worth shit especially in a country where street children are often referred to as ""lixo"" (garbage) and the wealthier classes perceive them as crime and danger personified.

This film takes you under the microscope of the lives of those favela street kids and the daily urban war waged upon them by a society that couldn't care less about them.

It's an indictment against the Brazilian society and I suppose any third world country for that matter. You don't need to go out and become some new age peace and love altruistic freak after witnessing this film. Just spare a thought for some poor kid who has no love, no hope and no chance.

I'm going to be honest here and say, I see the asking price for this movie and I find it to be outrageous.  You know where I found the movie?  The library and guess what, it was FREE for a week.  Check there first.",1201392000,,512,4.28125
186960,5,1567301355,"This is a part of the world we live in. We have all played a part in not only creating this world, but allowing it to continue. Each and every day, with the choices we make, we either tear each other down or we build each other up. I happen to believe that we are responsible for each other. If we see a film like this and we take it to heart, then how can we be so self-indulgent and uncaring toward our fellow human beings? How can I buy an expensive car or TV or suit of clothes when there are people like this in the world? Can't I do something better with my money? When you witness these powerful and horrifying images, you get a chilling sense of what hell must be like.

Babenco, though he would probably deny it, is a true prophet. No, not in the sense of predicting the future, but in the mere act of sharing reality with us. He is telling the brutal, unvarnished truth. Many of us are uncomfortable with the truth. And so we make fun or ignore or hate those who deliver it. We would all be wise to heed these prophets.

These children happened to be born when and where they were, in the midst of hell. They did not choose this; who in their right mind would? I happened to be born in relative comfort and ease, in upper-middle class America. I have always had huge advantages over most of the people on this earth, simply because I have never been hungry. Do I think that God does not expect much of me because of this disparity? I would be a fool to think so. Therefore, I need to do what I can to make this world more equal. Why should I have everything I would ever need, and most people on earth not even have enough to eat? There is something dreadfully wrong here.

As Americans we need to do everything we can to help those who have so little in this world. In a way, we should thank God for these poor unfortunates because they have a way of helping us see what our priorities should be. They are Jesus on the road to Calvary. Do we stop and help them? Do we carry the cross? Do we wipe the brow, and give water to drink? If we do not, we reject God.

186963,5,1567301355,"Hector Babenco's tale of homeless children in Brazil is devastating.  Must rank with some of the great films ever.

The film stars 10-year old Fernando Ramos da Silva, who was an illiterate kid plucked from the streets of Sao Paulo.  At the beginning of the film, a judge has been murdered and kids are rounded up and sent to a reformatory.  Pixote witnesses a brutal rape his first night.  He quickly adapts to the chaotic and often inhumane atmosphere.  Corrupt police pin the crime on one of Pixote's friends and brutally murder him.  They pin his murder on a second friend, and proceed to kill him.

Pixote and friends escape to the streets of Sao Paulo where they resume their life of crime.  The friends are Lillica, a transvestite soon to turn 18, Dito, Lillica's lover and ring-leader, and Chico.  The friends meet Cristal, a drug dealer who sends them to Rio to sell cocaine.  A drug deal gone awry costs Chico his life and Pixote kills the perpetrator, a prostitute named Debora.  The three boys hook up with another prostitute named Sueli, played by Marilia Pera in an unforgettable performance.

There is a sadness in Pixote's eyes that is unforgettable.  He accepts his descent into hell in a matter-of-fact manner.  Viewers will have difficulty deciding whether he sympathetic or not.  He is only ten, has a baby face, and faces horrible circumstances.  At the same time, he is an eager participant in the crimes that take place.  The portrayal of what Brazil's awful conditions do to the young and innocent is heartbreaking.",1109376000,13,1539,4.787072243346008
186964,5,1567301355,"This cult movie meant the major achievement of his master brazilian director Hector Babienco .
Inspired in the deepest roots of this ancient artistic movement the italian neo realism (in honor the first sample of this artistic category was born with a Jean Renour film of 1934 : Tony), Babenco camera literally is a merciless eye which scrutinizes every little detail and the unboreable atmosphere of the painful childhood in the streets of Brazil . In this case Fernando Ramos Da Silva (Pixote) made a glamorous debut as actor , where he becomes in adult without having lived his deserved childhood dreams and normal illusions of this age .
The cruelty will be its fellow partner ; so the world of the crime , prostitution , drugs and crookness will be the eternal friends in his miserable existence .
Fernado Ramos could never abandon such life level and years later he died victim of several shots in one of these countless favelas (this is the brazilian therm which designs the poorest neighborhood on the hills of the city).
The four most remarkable films which I remind closer to this in which its powerful and merciless social realism concerns are Salaam Bombay of Mira Nair 1989 ; Brutti , sporchi e cattivi a little gem of 1976 directed by Ettore Scola ; the other one is Mamma Roma of Pier Paolo Pasolini of the early sixties and that unforgettable film of Roberto Roselini Germania Anno Zero of the middle forties.
This film won the prize as Best Foreign Film of the L.A. Films Citics Association and the New York Film Critics of 1981 .

their natural ways were implemented in this film and we get to see what happens to them, they steal for food and end up in a juvenile home, where they are subject to abuse by the gaurds and inmates. the realism of the film is what makes it so good. the way we feel about the main character is that we want to embrace him, take him away so that we don't have to see or believe that this is the world we live in. A powerfull and moving film that should make you think more about children in poverty, i know i did. This film doesnt hold anything back. Be warned that there is some child nudity and a brief rape scene, but don't let this change your mind. if you like foreign films then this is a definite keep.",1042156800,4,932,4.070652173913044

186969,4,1567301355,"Pixote shocks and informs in a way that transcends our usual immunity mechanisms.
The next morning following viewing this movie a friend directed me to a flash presentation about poverty (URL follows). The Internet site presents a familiar menu of statistics and weary faces; while I became intraspective and moved for a few moments, I now hardly remember what it said.
Pixote keeps you uneasy for two hours; watching children aspire to and do illogical things.  You count down the last minutes wondering how it will end.  Without being documentary or editorial, Pixote is moving.  Statistics condense problems into numbers which are easy to forget and even easier to manipulate.  Wealth and technological advancement are important factors that jump out of statistics, but it is how you achieve advancements that determines who is left behind.  Pixote is not just poor, his life is valued less than the next drink of cachaca. As a drama it has the essential elements, well done.
The English subtitles on the DVD can be turned off, but were useful to understand unfamiliar slang. Other technical aspects could use some improvement, but the story drew me in enough to forget those.
If Pixote appeals to you, Hour of the Star (A hora de estrela) shouldn't be missed.

[Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco]

(Brazil - 1981)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Hector Babenco's third feature provides a harrowing and squalid glimpse into an alien culture beset by an all-consuming poverty. Chronicling the life and crimes of ten-year-old homeless boy Pixote (pronounced 'Pi-chott' or 'Pi-chott-ay', and played with remarkable sincerity by non-professional actor Fernando Ramos da Silva) in the slums of Sao Paulo, it follows him down the path of petty thievery to his brief stay in a reformatory where violence is a way of life, to his eventual escape and descent into murder. The only shafts of light are provided by his friends, fellow outcasts whose attempts to rise above their appalling circumstances are almost inevitably doomed to failure, and by an alcoholic prostitute (the luminous Marilia Pera) who unwittingly precipitates their downfall. In the end, only one of the characters emerges from the debris, returning to the slums where life - such as it is - goes on much the same as before. It isn't a pretty picture, nor can it ever be.

Though depressing and unlikeable, PIXOTE is virtually critic-proof. Based on a novel by Jose Louzeiro, Babenco's film offers an outraged response to the crushing hardships suffered by millions of homeless street kids in Sao Paulo who turn to crime to sustain themselves and are exploited by criminal gangs because of a loophole in Brazilian law which forbids the prosecution of minors. Most scandalous of all are the corrupt police officers who participate in the murder of countless street children every year, treating it as a form of 'pest control'. If nothing else, PIXOTE refuses to flinch from the reality of these terrible circumstances, depicting rape, murder, glue-sniffing and robbery with an uncompromising level of detail.

However, those seeking exploitation are advised to look elsewhere - these events are outlined against a backdrop of misery and ruined aspirations, in a crumbling landscape where even the smallest flicker of hope can be cruelly extinguished at any given moment. Worse still, despite the film's campaigning nature and its international theatrical success, these conditions still exist in Brazil today, and Ramos da Silva - whose social standing mirrored that of the character he played - ultimately succumbed to its worst excesses: Unable to escape the bonds of poverty which prevented him from realizing his dreams, he turned to crime and was murdered in 1987, allegedly by local police. His life and death was subsequently dramatized by director Jose Joffily in WHO KILLED PIXOTE? (1996).",992822400,20,2645,5.22877358490566
186971,4,1567301355,"Pixote is a movie about children living in a reformatory for children who get into trouble, or for children without family and homes.  Some of these children do not have family and need to steal, because they do not have money to feed themselves.  The movie is separated into two sections.  The first section, shows the boys in the reformatory.  The second section shows the boys living on the streets of Brazil after they escaped the reformatory.  Pixote is a child in the reformatory.  There are many problems that these boys encounter living in the reformatory.  Some of them use drugs, some violate other boys,  and some taunt the boys younger than them.  This reformatory is not safe for these boys.  They do not have families, so they become family with other boys.  Some of the boys are found dead.  The others do not want to die and the police are not protecting them.  They are afraid they will be the next ones killed.  Because of this, they escape for the streets of Brazil.  The streets are not safe either, but they are free.  They need to steal, because they have no money, and they need food.  In the beginning they help a drug dealer.  They meet a pimp, and buy his prostitute.  They live with this woman.  She will bring home a man, and later the boys come and rob the man.  This is how the get money. The women becomes part of their family.  The movie is very grafic with a lot of sex and nudity, but it is reality for some people.  It is very sad to see how some people live their lives.  Many parts I could not watch, because it was too graphic, but these are things chilren had to go through.",989452800,3,1613,4.353535353535354

Lo hico con el proposito de mostrara al mundo las problemas que los ninos Brasilenos tienen en las ciudades grandes. La pelicula fue hecho en las ciudades de Rio de Janeiro y Sao Paulo. Se trata de la vida dura de los ninos que viven en las calles. Babenco uso verdaderos ninos de la calle para los actores en la pelicula.  La pelicula emiepza con los ninos recogidos por la policia. Llevan los ninos y los meten en un reformatorio adonde se ponen peor en ves de mejor. Los ninos salen, incluyendo Pixote, que es el nombre del actor principal. Salen y viven en la calle robando y tambien empiezan a vender drogas. Varios amigos de Pixote se mueren por varios razones. Hasta Pixote mata a varios personas tambien. Al fin de la pelicula Pixote se sale solo porque se murieron o le abandonaron todos sus amigos. Nos deja con un imagen triste. El proposito de terminarlo haci es para que la gente del mundo se de cuenta de las problemas que existen para los ninos.  Esta pelicula en mi opinion era mas o menos. Era un poco dificil de ver.

186975,5,1567301355,"This film, in my opinions, embodies the expression ""packing a punch."" It is an unbelievable viewing experience. The film takes place in the slums of Brazil, where we are shown the poverty and crime which  surrounds millions of Brazilian children. This over populated country  provides a backdrop unlike any other you are likely to see. The story  follows 11 year old Pixote (""pee wee"") as he is brought into a  youth correctional facility, his escape and ultimately his meeting with  fate. The film is an inescapable tragedy which becomes even more disturbing  when knowing that the actor who played Pixote died at such a young age and  in such a violent way. This film serves as a testament to the unwanted  price many children face, and how minute our day to day problems suddenly  seem after watching such a work of uncompromised art.",956793600,6,837,4.7972027972027975
186976,4,1567301355,"I saw this film in the theater as a first release movie and still remember its disturbing images to this day.  While most movies show the innocent dream world we like to think children live in, Pixote slithers and crawls  through a dark and surreal world unknown to most of us -- yet it is a world  with recondite beauty because Pixote knows no other.  We see things happen  that would be totally unacceptable in the antiseptic world of civilization  but our little protagonists does not seem to see his world as anything but  normal.  With the self-survival morals of any jungle animal, he goes about  his day-to-day life.  And this juxtaposing of morals leads to a little bit  of an internal conflict with the viewer before the end of the movie.  I  highly recommend this film to anyone but would warn you that if the  ""Pollyanna"" world of children is what you think exists and want  to see, this film with keep you awake for quiet a few nights.",945734400,18,947,4.488235294117647
