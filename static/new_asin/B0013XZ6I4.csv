8253389,2,B0013XZ6I4,"There is actually very little educational material here that a half well read person wouldn't already know.  There is however a lot of propaganda, typical of most PBS documentaries.

The video does in fact discuss the perspective issues and their relation to the irregularities of form but doesn't explain it very well.  There is some material devoted to the actual work of marble sculpting and the problems of fitting blocks together but that too could have used much more time.  I am sure there is so much more to say about this craft both historically and in relation to the present day problems but the producers were too busy with other non essential matters.

PBS documentaries go out of their way to showcase anyone non white and non male.  In this case they seemed to search the four corners of the earth to find females to put on camera.  With no prompting from me, my elderly mother even picked up on this, rolling her eyes and exclaiming how obvious and silly it was.

So maybe the bent over backwards to showcase the women, but I assume they are at least qualified.  What was inexcusable was the usual leftist-progressive slant when it came to Greeks, democracy, the so called ""Golden Age of Pericles"", and Greek religion.  These erroneous views have become so widespread that most people will hardly blink an eye when they hear them.  After all, that's exactly what they learned in their Western Civ class in college.  How could it be wrong?  The video tries to make the Greeks out to be some secular humanists.  Any one who takes the time to actually read the Greek classics with an open mind will see the absurdity of this.  And this worship and equating the Athenian democracy with modern republicanism is an even bigger joke.  Most of these shameless lies were told on camera by male ""experts"".  Should have stuck with the women!

The whole golden section issue was poorly handled.  The video went on for a good bit with questionable claims about the use of the golden ratio by the ancients and in building the Parthenon.  After implanting these images in our heads, the narrator quickly tells us that most of these claims have been discredited.  So why go on and on about it?  Maybe they were just trying to spice things up a bit with this bit of half baked magical theory.  Spiced up or dumbed down?  You decide.",1372982400,3,2331,4.6292682926829265
8253390,5,B0013XZ6I4,"NOVA is nearly always worth watching.  It's fascinating to see how they are restoring the Parthenon using marble from the same quarry which supplied the original Temple, and oftentimes the same techniques.

It was also interesting to find that the Parthenon does NOT conform to the ""Golden Ratio"" as has been believed for centuries, and which I was taught about in Art Class a long time ago.",1287187200,3,391,4.82089552238806

8253392,5,B0013XZ6I4,"The Parthenon, considered by many the ultimate monument of antiquity, has coexisted in recent years with the glaring presence of modern construction, as a Parthenon reconstruction project which began in the mid-1970s continues its slow and somewhat controversial pace.  This Nova episode addressing the secrets of the Parthenon's construction paints a rather rosy picture, referring to the one hundred million dollars that has already been spent but saying nothing about the debate over remaining finances at this point.  The program does make clear why the restoration has been such a long and drawn out process, however -- it has been very much a learning process, revealing much new information on the original construction.

The Parthenon was completed in 432 B.C., a mere eight years after construction began.  It is, of course, a shadow of its former self.  Much of it lies in ruin, and the incredible statues that once graced its interior have been looted (mostly by Europeans of the 18th and 19th century).  Still, even in ruins this monument to the glory of ancient Athens still sits majestically stop the summit of the Acropolis.  One can hardly imagine a world without it, which is precisely why a decades-long effort to restore it was launched.  After some 2500 years, what remains of the Parthenon was in danger of collapsing.  As a traditionalist, I find it slightly troubling to see new pieces of marble being combined with the original stonework, but there is no other way to save it - and new material is only being used to replace pieces that can no longer be found among the ruins.  And, of course, it's not a full restoration, as it is only preserving the Parthenon as we know it today.

The ""secrets"" detailed in this documentary are basically all architectural in nature.  For example, no matter how perfectly symmetric the monument may look, there are subtle curves even on the foundations and cornices, the columns taper up oh so slightly, no two stones are exactly alike, and there are almost no right angles in evidence anywhere.  Much is made of the incredible precision of the marble stones.  One prominent idea discussed is that the design was modeled on the supposed ideal proportions of the human body, along with the notion that the ancient Greeks understood and incorporated the existence of optical illusions into the design.  Answers to some of the most mysterious architectural secrets of the Parthenon are only now being found, as those on the restoration project have been compelled to learn as much as they can figure out about the original design, and physical evidence from other ancient Greek sites help explain how the builders achieved such precision among builders using Doric, Common, as well as Ionic design techniques.

It's taking decades for modern technological man to restore only a portion of a monument that the ancient Greeks completely built in just eight years.  Clearly, we still have much to discover and learn from ""the secrets of the Parthenon.""",1240099200,15,3006,4.991983967935872
