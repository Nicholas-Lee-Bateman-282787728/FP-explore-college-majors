4904939,4,B005Y5NWCE,"It was a good movie but it was a little too long there is only so much drama in the movie to take. Also, it was more fictional than real. The real Ingrid Jonker had a much more complicated relationship with her father. I think the film's attempt to redempt Abraham Jonker in the end into a father that was actually sad about his daughter's suicide is out of the truth. In real life, the father did not care about her suicide. Other than that,  Clarice Van Houten does a great job playing Ingrid and should be recognized more as an actor.",1340496000,2,537,4.264705882352941

4904941,5,B005Y5NWCE,"BLACK BUTTERFLIES is a biographical drama based on the life of Ingrid Jonker. For those who are unfamiliar with this poet the following description my aid in the appreciation of this film: `Ingrid Jonker (19 September 1933 - 19 July 1965) was a South African poet. Although she wrote in Afrikaans, her poems have been widely translated into other languages. Ingrid Jonker has reached iconic status in South Africa and is often called the South African Sylvia Plath, owing to the intensity of her work and the tragic course of her turbulent life. Her work has also been compared to that of Anne Sexton.' Greg Latter has written the screenplay that attempts to give us all the facets of this enigmatic personality and the film is directed by Paula van der Oest. It is obviously an act of love.

We meet Ingrid and her sister Anna as children, poor, without shoes, and taken to the home of their Apartheid father Abraham Jonker (Rutger Hauer) the Minister of Censorship for the parliament of South Africa. As Ingrid (Carice van Houten) matures she becomes a beautiful, but impetuous young poet, feeling abandoned, blaming others, promiscuous, escaping in excessive drinking too much in order to feel safe and able to cope, and becoming overwhelmed by conflicting emotions, which characterize some common personality disorders. At her father's demand she married Pieter, has a daughter by him, and leaves him because she feels trapped. While swimming in the ocean she nearly drowns but is saved by writer Jack Cope (Liam Cunningham) - this act results in a love relationship and despite Jack's decaying marriage they plan to live together. They both support the young South African poet Nkos (Thamsanqua Mbongo) and aid his escape form South Africa to Europe in hopes of finding freedom to write. Ingrid's and Jack's relationship is passionate and stormy: Ingrid has affairs simply because she has the freedom of mind to do so, and the affair with one Eugene Maritz (Nicholas Pauling), a married man, drives Jack away. Ingrid aborts the child she conceived with Jack (Jack does not know this) and eventually does the same with a child conceived with Eugene. All the while Ingrid is suffering form her inner demons but at the same time becoming more aware of the cruelty of Apartheid. Her writings reflect these feelings and are censored by her father. Yet her greatest collection of poems about the Apartheid are published despite her father's wishes and her father disowns her for being a wasted `slut.' Ingrid's increasingly bizarre behavior results in several psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts and she goes to Paris where she is treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The treatment calms her but robs her of the ability to write poetry and during the night of 19 July 1965, Jonker went to the beach at Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town where she walked into the sea and committed suicide by drowning.

Carice van Houten, Liam Cunningham, and Rutger Hauer offer brilliant performances and the support cast is strong - Candice D'Arcy as Ingrid's sister Anna, Grant Swanby as Jan Rabie, and Graham Clarke as Jack's closest mate Uys Krige. During the film's credits we hear Nelson Mandela reading Ingrid's prize winning poem `The Dead Child of Nyanga', probably the most important poem to influence the end of Apartheid.

She searched for a home, she searched for love. Confronted by Apartheid and a father who was Minister of censorship. With men like Jack Cope and Andre Brink she found much love, but no home. In his first speech to the South African Parliament Nelson Mandela read her poem ""The Dead Child of Nyanga"" and addresses her as one of the finest poets of South Africa.
The child is not dead
The child lifts his fists against his mother
Who shouts Afrika ! shouts the breath
Of freedom and the veld
In the locations of the cordoned heart

The child lifts his fists against his father
in the march of the generations
who shouts Afrika ! shout the breath
of righteousness and blood
in the streets of his embattled pride

The child is not dead not at Langa nor at Nyanga
not at Orlando nor at Sharpeville
nor at the police station at Philippi
where he lies with a bullet through his brain

The child is the dark shadow of the soldiers
on guard with rifles Saracens and batons
the child is present at all assemblies and law-givings
the child peers through the windows of houses and into the hearts of mothers
this child who just wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere
the child grown to a man treks through all Africa

the child grown into a giant journeys through the whole world
Without a pass

This is a courageous and deeply moving film about a great poet. Grady Harp, April 12",1333929600,4,4709,4.79064039408867

4904986,5,B005Y5NWCE,"As much as I would like to know more details about her life and the traumas she experienced through the so-called father, in this movie the details would have distracted me from her as the person, the woman, the daughter, the mother, the wife, the friend and lover-none of whom she knew how to be or who they were. I needed to see her without the outlying factors that so deeply and destructively formed and unformed her.
This woman was not self-centered, she did not know her self or even what a self was. She craved and needed and defined those cravings and needs by what the world told her they meant. But they were hollow and really meaningless to her because what she had been told or shown they were, betrayed her.
Don't look for the typical hype movie here. Don't look for step by step explanations and details. Just really focus on her and her depth, without ever having been shown or given depth of anything except pain, judgement, and rejection. See her as she was-raw, unprotected, no defense mechanisms, running on needs and drives that she doesn't understand but sometime may give her temporary solace. See her ripped open incessantly, and then ruthlessly stitched up again, temporarily, with unclean and dull, rusty instruments and no anesthetic; and then expected again to find and be whatever normal and rational is, even though she is never provided definitions or examples to understand.
Her oxygen became anguish, and then pa (I cannot capitalize this name) knowingly and deliberately deprives her of even that. Without even that oxygen, she begins to slowly and excruciatingly deflate, like the delicate glass balloon she has become. She understands little now, except she does know that now there will never be a chance for her or life to be better.
Look at her, not the claptrap that usually exists in movies like this.
Even though Frances Farmer was not a poet, this reminds me so much of ""Will there ever be a morning?""",1399075200,3,1943,4.7514792899408285
4904987,3,B005Y5NWCE,"I found Black Butterfly interesting, but not so much that I would highly recommend it.  The poet, Ingrid Jonker, was obviously talented, but more than a little self-centered, and seemed not to care about anyone but herself.  For this reason, the movie was not particularly inspirational, and somewhat of a ""downer.'",1397952000,,315,5.1568627450980395
4904988,5,B005Y5NWCE,"When a child is neglected, ignored, abused or never fully loved by a parent, the devastation sweeps over the child, permeates the child, saturates the alveolation of her life and so the child becomes inextricably interweaved with this malignancy. It takes the strength of something unhuman to break free from this identity, and often, the child, now a woman, cannot. It is difficult for anyone who has not endured the ceaseless perniciousness  of feeling unloved, unwanted, to comprehend the magnitude of destruction that it causes in that child, now a woman, and now swallowed by a grief so viscous that a whole life is the task of keeping one's head above water, lest she drown. And drowning seems all too often a release from the pain that pools like mercury in the very viscera of that woman, once a child, who was too weak to endure the malignancy of the parent whose only duty was to love, but who failed. Ingrid's life was not a joyous one, though it was not without its joys. She was brilliant, but her brilliance would never be acknowledged by the only people who mattered, her mother, dead whilst she was young, and her father, dead inside but still alive with an incomparable rancor. And what happened to Ingrid is what happened to that child, now a woman, now forever lost, forever struggling, and forever wading to keep from drowning, when drowning would ease all of the pain. Knowing this is her refuge and her salvation, the thing that pacifies her in the maelstrom of her life.

Immediately and outwardly, we dislike Ingrid Jonker. She is careless and extreme, narcissistic and self-centered. It is because her helplessness mirrors our own that we feel this. She throws herself into her helplessness with abandon and without apology, she agnizes her pain entirely. This makes us uncomfortable. There are not many writers who are truly 'raw', as they say. Raw is the definition of someone who refuses a shield or mantle. Raw is the definition of someone who is not afraid to reveal wild emotions, even if it makes those around her uncomfortable. She wears her pain unabashedly, and this is what caused the rift between father and child. It is not her flagrant refusal to follow his rigid rules that makes him despise her, it is that her whole being is a reflection of his inability to love. In her, he sees his failure as a man and as a human. To despise her is to despise himself.

They say that the sea took her, I say that she was in full control. She determined in what manner she would live, and she determined the moment that she would take herself from the world. She was a raging fire in life, and she wrote her poetry in her own flames. Had she lived longer, she may have tempered, had she found her way, had she harnessed that fire and directed it within. Shed light on the pain, and the pain will dissolve. Shed light on the fear and the fear melts away. But then, what of her poetry? What of the words that described her view of the world? It is just these words that make her the icon who we remember her as. And here we step back and we see a soul with a burden that could only be carried by a warrior, and then we can call her 'crazy' no more. Then we shall call her a warrior, because the woman, forever a child, was strong enough to carry this pain, and forge something beautiful from it. Black butterflies and forever living children who raise their fists for Africa with bullets lodged in their heads.",1397779200,3,3435,4.5281803542673105

4904990,5,B005Y5NWCE,"I'm not sure why IMDB viewers gave this film such a low rating, but given that they often give popular but banal movies high scores, I can only surmise that it might be too high brow or intense for general entertainment. Additionally, at the core of the story is the central character, South African poet Ingrid Jonker, who is never easy or lovable, though I loved her.

Unlike one of the the top reviewers, I understood her motivation and that her rebellion [and brilliance] was formed as a reaction to her neglectful, powerful, wealthy and domineering father [Rutger Hauer], the minister for censorship in the South African government. He is not only racist but sexist and as he seeks to suppress the outrage building up in his country against apartheid, he also seeks to squelch his daughter's unique and honest voice. Rather than leaving him and her past behind, Jonker's every move seems to be made in order to provoke a reaction from him whenever she can't gain his approval. In the interim, leaving her marriage, she seeks security with an older writer, who caught up in her exuberant sexuality, promotes her career. Yet all the while she undermines herself and any chance for a decent life she might make for herself and her child as her financial situation becomes precarious and her psyche becomes more and more unbalanced.

Carice van Houten gives a standout performance as Jonker in this disturbing and unusual film which is notable for its period detail. Recommended",1395619200,2,1479,4.865079365079365
4904991,4,B005Y5NWCE,"Black Butterflies, a picture of the life of Ingrid Jonker (Carice van Houten) in South Africa during the years of Apartheid is a movie that leaves many impressions. She was a poet & the daughter of a South African MP or representative of an electoral district. Born to privilege, her mother died in an asylum she herself would later be admitted to herself. She showed signs of mental illness all her life & spent many of her days self medicating with sex & alcohol. Yet her talent with words is well documented in her poems.

Being in conflict with her father's political beliefs she suffered an estrangement from him even when in the same room. It is well known that daughters who fail to receive the love they need from living fathers often turn to other men for love & approval. Sex, being the mechanism they try to use to obtain that that they lacked growing up, creating unstable relationships in their adult life too. They become a burden to those around them & not the first person you'd seek as a friend. Her choices as an adult leave a lot to be desired. Even her own daughter who she chose to leave motherless was used more as a crutch than an object of love & responsibility.

She lived a life of mental turmoil in a country of extreme prejudice & hated that inequality. Unable to forget or assuage the pain of her circumstances, that pain grew over the years to choke her. Yet she became the voice of those that were declared less than human by her father's beliefs. A poem of hers was read at the first democratically elected South African Congress. It begins, ""The child is not dead""

She took her own life after having withstood all the pain & confusion she could in this life & that will always be controversial in this world. Who is to judge how a person that retains constant contact with mental agony so that it builds in them year by year with little or no relief is to be seen? We call those that overcome such circumstances heroes & hope we are like them. Yet those that see the inequities in this world & summarily reject such things for themselves while seeing them clear enough to describe them in verse, having those things enter their mind through their eyes on a daily basis, what can we say of them. Ingrid was a load to carry if you knew her & quite frankly I'm glad I didn't. I'm no fan of suicide either but I find more sorrow than condemnation in her passing. It is for certain that the people of a South Africa free of Apartheid see her as worthy of praise.

Carice van Houten is excellent in portraying a life made of & lived by confusion. Rutger Hauer as her father & Liam Cunningham as her main love in life are strong in their roles as well. There is little in this movie that is shot as pretty or engaging scenery with the exception of the ocean. It's not intended to be pretty either in appearance or portrayal. Nudity is included but it is tastefully done. I was tempted to turn this off early on while they were displaying Ingrid's choices in life. It was a difficult watch to get through because of my dislike for her personality & life but I was glad I hung in till the end. I give it 4 out of 5 Amazon stars overall. 5 out of 5 for making me think through my reactions to it.

It only rates 5.8 at imdb but I think a lot of people quit on this one & rated it anyway.",1382572800,7,3311,4.2912
4904992,4,B005Y5NWCE,"Most reviews of this film with compare Ingrid Jonker, poet from South Africa who died in 1965 with American poet Sylvia Plath.  I always very strongly felt that it is unfair to compare artists and in many ways, provides dis-service to both.  So let's just focus on Ingrid as this is the film abut her life and her body of work.

Ingrid lived her early childhood with her mother and her maternal grandparents.  Her father was estranged from Ingrid and Ingrid's mother.  Only after Ingrid's immediate family died,  when Ingrid was at he age of 10, her father reluctantly takes Ingrid and her sister Anna to his house where they end up growing up a servants' quarters.  Ingrid's father was a high ranking politician in South Africa.  Ingirid and her father were on the complete opposites of the political spectrum.  Their mutual dislike for each other was not something either one was willing to conceal.  In order to escape her father, Ingrid marries and has a child only to find her marriage suffocating just as much as her life in her father's house.  As her marriage ends in divorce, Ingrid devotes herself to writing.  Her circle of friends consists of writers and intellectuals who are opposing apartheid.

For the first time in her life, Ingrid falls in love with Jack Kopp, another writer, much older than her, who is going through a messy divorce.  Jack has her heart, but does not fully grasp Ingrid's emotional vulnerability.  Inevitable, instead of being her savior and most strident supporter -- both personally and professionally, Jack withdraws his love for Ingrid.  She never tells Jack that she was pregnant with his child because Ingrid wants him to marry her for love, not for sense of obligation or superficial decency.  Her decision to abort her love child with Jack has far more reaching effect on her than anyone, including herself can possibly imagine.  Until one day, when she witnesses death of the small black child by the policeman partolling the streets.  That event re-opens all of her supressed  traumas and unleashes stream of emotions that Ingrid can no longer contain on her own.

As a mother of a small child (Ingrid has daughter Simone from her first marriage); no financial stability and constant desertion by the men she courts; Ingrid falls deeper and deeper in a state of sorrow, unhappiness and dispair that lands her in a mental hospital.  Her father opts for Ingrid to have electroshock therapy.  While this kills her ability to express her emotions and feelings, it also kills her ability to write.  Suddenly, Ingrid is stripped of everything: she cannot write, she has no protection or feeling of safety; she feels abandoned by her father, her lovers and even her sister Anna.  She sees no way out - she sees herself as death and; as poet Dylan Thomas says ""after death there is no other"".  Ingrid commits suicide by jumping into the ocean one stormy night.

Many will argue how someone like Ingrid had personality disorder, was not mentally stable and was troubled.  Personally I do not think that is true.  Ingrid was deeply emotional person who could feel the pain of others and her own on a higher level.  That type of susceptable angst only true artists can feel.  That is their gift and also their curse.  They need to be constantly looked after  and taken care of, always assured of love and security.  It is love and security they missed early in their lives and those needs made a strong imprint on their personalities (and their work).  Cruelty, harshness, distance, betrayal and abandonment are too painful for them and without the proper support system leads them to self-destruction.  Ingrid Jonker, like Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath and so many others are fragile lighbugs, lady bugs and butterfies that very few understand and even fewer know how to protect.  Their magnetism and power is drawn from their vulnerability that is much more pronounced than it is in ordinary people...",1369353600,3,3938,4.841317365269461

It covers the tragic life of Afrikaans poet, Ingrid Jonker, and her various lovers. When I studied Afrikaans literature at the University of the Witwatersrand in the sixties, these literary figures were all on the syllabus. So perhaps the movie had special meaning for me. But it is a rich, if sad  account of the challenge for writers in apartheid-era South Africa, and beautifully acted. I recommend it most highly, but don't watch it on a day in which you are in a low mood, because it will only take you lower: Ingrid was a complicated, somewhat tortured soul who seemed to deliberately exposed those she loved to hurt.",1512864000,,924,5.6

8489104,5,B005Y5NWCE,"I had streamed this movie many times on Netflix, but it is no longer available for streaming so I broke down and bought it. It is about Ingrid Jonker, a poet, who wrote the famous poem 'Die Kind' about apartheid in South Africa. Her father was part of a government board on censorship which she publicly opposed despite the distress in caused in her family relationships. The movie also dramatizes her relationship and romance with Jack Cope.",1481328000,,442,4.753246753246753
