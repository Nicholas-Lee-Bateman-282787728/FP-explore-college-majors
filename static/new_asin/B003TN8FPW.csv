4190861,5,B003TN8FPW,"I really enjoyed the dvd, really learned a lot. Have read a lot of books on this subject But this dvd help me more than all the books.
 I also recommend buying Samuel's books to go along with this dvd. Though all plants listed are not found in the south but most of them are.",1314057600,7,275,4.0
4190862,5,B003TN8FPW,"This DVD is very helpful and one of the best educational tools on foraging wild food. I also highly recommend his books. My favorite part was seeing him harvesting rice and dry storing it. I too agree on what has been previously said about the packaging, but I do appreciate the efforts in trying to keep it echo-friendly. Overall, I highly recommend all Samuel Thayer's works.",1296604800,10,377,4.7272727272727275
4190863,5,B003TN8FPW,"I can agree with the review of ""Shoelaced"" from November, 2010. For some reason, my Disc 1 didn't automatically go back to the menu when I finished the first set of plants and had to do it manually as it came up as unreadable/error. Where the cut-outs are for the discs caused some flecks of the ink to stick to the DVD so you may want to inspect and gently remove any stuck ink before playing. The disc packaging is an environmentally friendly ""Eco-wallet"" that eliminates plastic and is instead made with recycled board and printed with non-toxic vegetable-based inks. Regardless, these 2 DVD's are a great addition/compliment to the book and gives you the experience of how Sam goes about some of his foraging/processing techniques. What's also nice is you get to see some of the habitats where he finds the edibles in a broader perspective. Every plant that is in the book is covered alphabetically in the DVD's and the menu allows you to go to a specific plant if you choose. It will deliver useful information to you faster in this video format that would otherwise be difficult to convey with words alone. Not much else to say other than that it's worth the 23 bucks.",1293408000,15,1174,4.62200956937799
4190864,4,B003TN8FPW,"This DVD set is an excellent companion to the book.  It shows Sam talking about each plant and his methods of harvesting (and in some cases preparing) them.  It's a great way to get a better feel for each plant than the book can provide with still images.  My criticisms would be that it's not formatted very well and the packaging is terrible: it comes in a cardboard bifold and some of the ink from it had come off onto the discs during shipping.  I had to do a pretty vigorous cleaning with cotton swabs and alcohol before I could watch them.  It would be great to see a DVD to accompany ""Nature's Garden"" as well!",1288915200,9,617,4.2844827586206895
4190865,5,B003TN8FPW,"Samuel Thayer has done us all a huge service with this dvd and his two books. (Forager's Harvest and Nature's Garden - both highly recommended.) The dvd is highly informative and easy to understand. It has all the info you need to identify, enjoy, and prepare common wild edibles. Seems to be geared toward mostly Midwest species.",1389052800,,330,4.807017543859649
4190866,5,B003TN8FPW,This is definately the best video yet on identifying editable wild plants. I can't wait for Samuel to make more DVD's that will identify even more plants. Please keep them coming!,1376438400,,179,4.806451612903226
4190867,4,B003TN8FPW,"Great DVD and training material.  I felt like I learned more about how to go about identifying, locating, and preparing wild edibles from this dvd then I have learned from countless hours of flipping through multiple different thick field guides. It does a great job of showing how the same plants can look completely different during the different seasons.  Make sure you do also get the accompanying book.  It is  excellent as well.  He wisely sticks with concentrating on the most common and tasty edibles.

I'd give it 5 stars instead 4 if there were more edible plants that were common to the Oklahoma area.  The video would have also came off a little more professional had the instructor upgraded his attire from his usual tromping through the woods clothes, but it kept it genuine.",1376092800,,789,4.8
4190868,4,B003TN8FPW,"Good video to watch with some good details on the title subject, would recommend this video, priced right for the material in this DVD.",1373155200,,135,4.666666666666667
4190869,5,B003TN8FPW,"A good companion to the book. You should get both, that way you get more information and you get to meet the guy who wrote the book.",1366675200,,132,3.925925925925926
4190870,5,B003TN8FPW,"This dvd is very informative and entertaining! I have a lot of confidence that Samuel Thayer knows what he's talking about. I have read both of his books and watched this dvd that parallels the book ""Forager's Harvest"". When watching someone and listening to them you can get an even better understanding than reading alone, (although the books are very important for thorough descriptions.) For anyone interested in the amazing world around us full of edible plants, I believe you will greatly appreciate this dvd. I hope he makes another dvd to go with his other book ""Nature's Garden"". In fact I hope he keeps writing too! Samuel Thayer, are you reading this?",1366156800,3,662,4.867256637168142
4190871,2,B003TN8FPW,"I only received 1 of 2 discs the second DVD in the case was ALSO the same DVD marked number one also

UPDATE:Thanks to Brian P ~ brian@foragersharvest.com for very kindly sending me the second disk. Looking forward to foraging!",1361923200,,227,4.675
4190872,5,B003TN8FPW,"I'm going to look for more DVDs by Samuel Thayer.  I wish I'd seen this when I used to live in Minnesota.  I  would have liked to have met him and learned more.  This DVD is better than many of the Edible Plants books that I own, and I have more than a dozen.",1361232000,,259,3.740740740740741
4190873,5,B003TN8FPW,This DVD is excellent.  Mr. Thayer really shows you where to find everything and what to look for.  I didn't realize how many plants you could use and he also shows you how to use them.,1360972800,2,185,4.111111111111111
4190874,5,B003TN8FPW,"Samual Thayer is the probably best source for foraging food to actually consume.  He has harvested, prepared and eaten all the plants he writes about.  He tells you how practical a certain plant is to harvest.  Also, he tells you when the best time to harvest the plant and how he prepares it. You will not regret buying all his books and DVDs - they will open a wild supermarket of actual wild food to you.",1357430400,,407,4.328947368421052
8405276,5,B003TN8FPW,Lots of great information and examples.,1492560000,,39,5.666666666666667
8405277,5,B003TN8FPW,"One of the ""bibles"" for foraging outdoors. I have used it multiple times. Until I bought this book, I didn't realize that I had a salad garden growing naturally on my property every spring and early summer. Really! I was growing wild spinach, plantain, chicory, purslane and chick weed just to name a few and I didn't even know it! I learned how to prepare dandelion root, use dandelion flowers in salads and how to prepare the young greens so they are not bitter. This is a great book and I highly recommend it.",1451779200,2,512,4.457446808510638
8405278,3,B003TN8FPW,"Meh. Samuel Thayer is a fantastic writer, and I can't recommend The Forager's Harvest (the book) and Nature's Garden enough. This video is not up to the same standards of quality. I have read his books over and over again, I stopped watching this after a few plants and have never gotten around to finishing it.",1444521600,2,311,4.571428571428571
8405279,5,B003TN8FPW,This is a great DVD.,1442534400,,20,3.2
8405280,5,B003TN8FPW,"I bought this dvd set along with Samuel Thayer's book ""Nature's Garden"" so that you can watch the visual reference then take the book with you if you have any difficulty spotting or identifying wild plants. There are 32 wild plants arranged alphabetically broken into two DVD's.

Sam shows you how to harvest the plants and shows you how to prepare them. Many times the plants can be eaten raw or by simply boiling in a pot. Sometimes the preparation is labor intensive and requires basic equipment which is demonstrated.

If you are looking to explore alternative food sources or supplement your current grocery list this will open your mind to practical alternatives. If there was a disaster I'm sure the author would live just fine off the land but for the beginner forager treat this book as a supplement to your current food supply.",1439078400,3,837,4.76551724137931
8405281,3,B003TN8FPW,"Not nearly as comprehensive or detailed as I had hoped. Covers only about 20 plants, and instead of giving in-depth descriptions or bulletpoints of how to identify them, it shows a wide shot of him gathering plants, often describing elements of collecting you don't see anyway, making a video of the process rather pointless. I at least expected a close-up image of the plants at the beginning or end of the chapter, so we could get a sense of what to look for. What we get is a locked down camera, 15 feet away, while he pulls something green out of the dirt. Slightly more valuable as a collection/preparation guide than anything to help you make identifications.",1433980800,4,665,4.6923076923076925
8405282,5,B003TN8FPW,Good book,1424131200,,9,4.0
8405283,5,B003TN8FPW,very well done.,1420675200,,15,4.333333333333333
8405284,5,B003TN8FPW,Great DVD. It was nice to see things demonstrated.,1409529600,,50,4.666666666666667
8405285,5,B003TN8FPW,"I ordered this DVD after I have bought the book by Samuel Thayler in the same topic. Actually, I have already written a comment for it in the review I did for the book. Both are pretty good. I recommed them for anyone who is interested in plants.
Samuel Thayer is a great expert in plants and his featuring in the DVD is very clear. it is nice to hear him.",1401321600,,356,4.028169014084507
