8142261,5,B000HXE5OW,"Good picture quality.  Recommended for fans of this F1 period.  Not all of the races of the season were included, but great racing and pit area footage for the covered races.  I wish it was longer, as these are concise reviews of selected individual races.",1421712000,,256,4.644444444444445
8142262,2,B000HXE5OW,Narrated clips of the season. No flow to it. I would not recommend unless you like to watch a bunch of snippets.,1391299200,,112,4.136363636363637
8142263,5,B000HXE5OW,If you love Formula 1 you will absolutely love this...watch this then go see Ron Howard's new big screen movie 'RUSH'. Excellent.,1383004800,,129,4.909090909090909
8142264,5,B000HXE5OW,"I saw the movie Rush and it was great.  I then saw this DVD and it made it even better.  This series did an excellent job with formula 1.  Sure they left off a few of the tracks, just like the movie.  But excellent DVD nevertheless.",1381968000,,232,3.9782608695652173
8142265,5,B000HXE5OW,"I love Formula One. Sadly today's version of it is a far cry from the truly great eras and drivers that graced the sport throughout the years. Through the cleanly painted rear engined racing cigars of the 1960s, through the wingy ""pack of cigarettes"" monsters of the 1970s, and through the super-fat 1,000 HP turbo beasts of the 1980s the sport always seemed to know no bounds as cars got faster and faster and things more out of control in terms of cost going forward into the future. That is why those who love this sport and its history do so. The sheer madness of it all coupled with the competition spanning the globe vying for the title of Driver's Championship as country against country fight to produce the greatest chassis, the greatest engine, and the greatest driver all culminating in the epic soap opera of testosterone and oil. Sadly we are not all in the same boat when it comes to fandom of F1 in this country and the scarcity of F1 titles available on DVD is a direct result. So, we must be happy with the few options thrown our way and that is why I give 5 stars to this series of short 50 minute films covering the F1 seasons from 1970-1980. The picture quality is great as is the rare ability to see these classic cars we cherish at different angles. Quite a treat for F1 nuts. I've rewatched each film several times and they NEVER get old.",1379030400,,1361,4.404761904761905
8142266,5,B000HXE5OW,"1976 was a quite a year in Formula One, and Duke Video (as always) does a very good job of bringing us the highlights. Although James Hunt was certainly very competitive in the McLaren, it was Niki Lauda's horrific crash at the Nurburgring that sealed the championship. When one realizes that Niki was given last rites at the hospital in Germany only to return to racing a few short weeks later, the incredible story of this season becomes clear. Despite his disfiguring injuries, Niki went on to challenge for the championship anyway. 1976 was a microcosm of some of the major stories of this Formula One era as issues of safety continued to top the headlines. I would recommend this disc highly. Narration is quite good. Video quality is good as you will ever see for this period. The only downside is the annoying ""music"" that precedes each video segment.",1202428800,4,858,4.726666666666667
