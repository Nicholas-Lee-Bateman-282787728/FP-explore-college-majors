1984624,2,B0001AVZX0,"When you throw down a movie in front of me called ""Blood Gnome,"" I've got no choice but to respond. Especially when the cover shows a couple of nasty looking beasties with watermelon shaped heads and rows of sharp teeth. Who could resist such a temptation? Not me, my friends, not me! Check this out: ""Blood Gnome"" is a movie that fuses BDSM with nasty little gnomes that have the ability to appear and disappear at will. You heard correctly. BDSM and bloodthirsty gnomes from another dimension! Wow! It's obvious just from the description alone that Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, and any other modern masters of the cinematic art form should just hang up their lenses and go home. There's a new director in town, his name is John Lechago, and he's taking no prisoners! ""Blood Gnome"" easily beats out the finest moments of movie history. It towers over such ""classics"" as ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Metropolis,"" and ""Star Wars."" Classics! Ha! These movies are pure crud made by rank amateurs compared with the genius of ""Blood Gnome."" I hesitate to mention such drivel when reviewing Lechago's masterpiece. Yes, ""Blood Gnome"" will stand as a monument to future filmmakers.

Where do I even start? I feel totally inadequate to the task of reviewing this picture. Perhaps it's best to stick with the essentials and hope and pray that I get them right. I'm so unworthy! Anyway, Lechago's epic introduces us to a cast of memorable characters. The most important is a beefy looking lass by the name of Elandra (Ri Watson). She's mixed up in several unsavory activities, including but not limited to drug dealing and blood gnomes. What are blood gnomes, you ask? Why, they're creatures interested in preying on members of the BDSM community that take part in something called ""Blood Sports."" What this entails, and I see I'm already out of my league, are select members of this alternative community who cut each other and bleed for kicks. Oh fun! When some of these people start turning up dead, crime photographer Daniel (Vincent Bilancio) somehow sees something everyone else misses. Specifically, his camera catches images of the invisible blood gnomes. Since Daniel spent some time in the laughing academy due to a tragedy involving his ex-wife and a lover, his associates think he's going bonkers again when he tells them what he sees. Great men often face similar challenges. Remember when Abraham Lincoln claimed aliens from the planet Xerxes ran the Confederacy? Daniel is in good company.

Daniel, the good citizen that he is, decides to investigate the blood gnomes further. With the help of a foxy BDSM insider named Divinity (Melissa Pursley), Danny boy moves in for the information that will blow this story sky high. The images that float by from this point to the film's final, mind-blowing revelations keep me up at night in a state of pure wonderment. Nothing less than shining brilliance is on display when we see that the blood gnomes not only know how to use a computer, but also learn how to send Daniel instant messages. The sequence involving the demise of Detective Sterling (Charles Mosby), a cop who unfortunately stumbles onto Elandra's nefarious schemes, rivals Rutger Hauer's much lauded death scene in ""Blade Runner."" And the denouement of ""Blood Gnome""! I sat like a stone in my barcalounger, dumbstruck at the wonder of it all, as Daniel, Divinity, Elandra, and special guest star and BDSM goddess Julie Strain showed us the ins and outs of blood sporting in all of its myriad forms. Never before have I witnessed such profound filmmaking, and it's unlikely I'll see anything in the future that will match, let alone surpass, this masterpiece. Every second of this movie is magic on a scale rarely realized.

O.k., time to get serious. ""Blood Gnome"" stinks. It really stinks. The dialogue plumbs new depths of banality. The production values are bad. Film sets are obviously rooms in the filmmaker's house--or his mother's basement. While I appreciated the occasional blood and guts sequences, the special effects used to realize the blood gnomes are laughable. The acting will make your ears bleed, especially the cackhanded delivery of Ri Watson. An extra on the disc tells us she primarily works as a stuntwoman. Obviously, she took one too many falls down a flight of stairs or too many shots to the head with a two by four. Vincent Bilancio comes off just as poorly, sad to say, in a performance that ranks right up there with Mal Arnold's turn in Herschell Gordon Lewis's ""Blood Feast."" He relies far too often on mugging for the camera, and his irritating whine resembles in no small way the sound a pair of garden shears dragged over a chalkboard would make. The only reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one is because of Melissa Pursley. She's a gorgeous Goth type chick that provides the film's only light. I'd love to see her in a better film.

Extras, if you dare to spend more time with this disc than absolutely necessary, consist of a commentary track--more like a confession to a major felony--with Lechago and producer Randy Mermell, and a behind the scenes documentary filled with cast and crew interviews. We even get a look at the puppet work--eat your heart out, Jim Henson--that went into creating the blood gnomes. Only the hardiest schlock film fans should view ""Blood Gnome,"" and even then devouring the movie in small bits is the best way to watch it. Trying to wade through the whole thing in one sitting could well cause massive and irrevocable brain damage. You've been warned!",1129852800,6,5595,4.873949579831932
1984625,1,B0001AVZX0,"this movie was not kosher with me mainly because it seemed as if the characters were improvising the script as they went along. its almost as if the director started this project soley for the purpose to see naked girls. the antogonist of the film is the drug/bdsm/blood gnome queen. she's also perpetually the antithesis of beauty.  i sincerely believe rental places should pay the customers for removing the fowl stench this movie's aura places over all the movies setting around it on the shelf. as incredibly and exhaustingly consuming of your mind this is, you will feel as if you'll be looking back at the time you watched this movie while on your death bed hoping you had those two hours replaced by any memory other than this cinematic labotomy. the person responsible for this waste more than likely could have made more money selling ice cubes to eskimos.",1118016000,6,865,4.766666666666667
1984626,1,B0001AVZX0,"Worst movie ever made. Me and my buddies made a horror movie when we were 14 with a sony handycam and used 2 vcrs to edit in sound affects and music, and this movie here made my movie look like Will Smiths Independance Day movie...",1111968000,,231,4.155555555555556
1984627,1,B0001AVZX0,"In this unofficial sequel to Critters (or maybe it's Ghoulies), a bunch of evil latex puppets terrorize anyone foolish enough to partake in BDSM. The sad part is, there's almost an interesting idea here, but it is totally wasted. It would have been nice if the writer would have actually done some research, rather than just watching Exit to Eden a couple of times and assuming he knew anything about the fetish community.

There's a goofy walkthrough by Scream Queen Julie Strain (which may be the highlight of the movie, sad to say). This movie would make Lloyd Kaufman, Roger Corman and Charlie Band cringe.",1100217600,3,610,4.809523809523809
1984628,1,B0001AVZX0,"Honestly....this has to be the worst movie ever made. Period. The main problem with it is this....IT MAKES NO F%@%$$# SENSE WHATSOEVER.First off,the movie starts out with a crime scene that occurred inside a house. Yet,they take some police caution tape and wrap it around a tree. What does a tree have to do with a murder that happened inside the f#@%&*^ house?? The acting is only the beginning...it looks like they just found these guys off the streets. The main character has tendancies to make the ''O'' face as much as possible...even when he gets kicked in the junk by one of those gomes. As far as the gnomes go.....Where did they come from??? Some dominatrix spawns them from a barrel??And that makes sense how??? What's even worse is the DVD extras. It shows the director ranting and rambling on about how good this movie is and how it relates to his life....this guy must have had one f#@#$# up childhood if he's going to portray it about gnomes and bondage. In conclusion,if you want to roll on the floor laughing as I did,rent this movie IMMEDIATELY.",1093996800,5,1063,4.659574468085107
1984629,1,B0001AVZX0,"This is quite possibly the worst thing to ever be caught on film, next to the jon bene ramsey killer made-for-tv movie. It has the worst actors that i have ever seen, and it is spawned from the worst idea ever. I don't know about the average American, but i really don't care to see bondage in the first place. Let alone, with gnomes beating up humans!! The only part of this movie that was worth while was seeing one of those things get kicked square in the junk. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!! (unless you are on something)",1093219200,2,535,4.306930693069307
1984630,5,B0001AVZX0,"Frank Capra. Billy Wilder. Orson Welles. And now, John Lechago. A finer film was never produced that involves a drug lord, bondage fetishes, crime photography, and of course evil gnomes that have Internet capability. Five stars for campiness.
  It's a love story really. A romance between a crime scene photographer who's investing gnomes only he can see through his infra red camera and the dominatrix who shows him the softer side of what she does. As the blood gnomes play a deadly game of cat and mouse over Instant Messenger technology(using the screenname ""Blood Gnome""), they manage to frame the main character for murder and kidnap his woman all on thier own.

  Oh, and there's a lot of bondage and nudity. Not so much of Julie Strain, however, if that would sway you to see it.
  This is independent filmmaking cheese at its best. The director and stars play it like they're in a serious movie instead of one about invisible killer gnomes, as is evidenced in the almost humor-free Behind The Scenes Documentary. There's a reference to Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"" in one of the fight scenes, but I'm still trying to decide whether that was intentional or not.
  Anyway, see it!",1087689600,2,1189,4.78921568627451

8009358,1,B0001AVZX0,"Writer/director/editor John Lechago (Bio Slime, Killjoy 3, Killjoy Goes to Hell) has put together a real stinker!  This movie has low film quality akin to a WikiLeaked sex video, lousy writing and even worse acting.  This comes off as a poor student-made film.  Given the present filmmaker's skills, it should come as no surprise that nudity abounds (including a Julie Strain cameo) to cover up its shortcomings with juvenile entertainment.  Lloyd Kaufman's raunchy, exploitative Tromaville films are more attentively crafted than this crap.

From the start we learn that a drug distributor has some little monsters in a crate.  As horrible as this movie clearly is, this actually raised a brow in interest for me at first.

A naked couple engaged in BDSM activities are killed by an invisible force.  Spoiler alert!  Blood gnomes did it!  A crime scene photographer (Vinnie Bilancio; Witchcraft XI, Bio Slime) is on to something strange when he sees a tiny bloody hand print and starts seeing invisible monstrous gnomes eating victims with his infrared camera setting.

What's preposterously stupid here is that he sees the gnomes eating the victims right in front of the CSI team!  As if they're being invisible meant that no one would see the masticated flesh or hear the slopping sounds of flesh-eating two feet away from them.

As if it was his job to solve the case, our photographer becomes involved with a dominatrix and his ""research"" takes the form of BDSM sessions.  How this will help a photographer solve a string of evil gnome homicides, I have no idea!  As a result, far more than telling a story about carnivorous fairies this movie succeeds at teaching the ABCs of BDSM to anyone completely ignorant to the subject.  In fact, that may be the only thing this movie does successfully.

The budget is bare bones low.  It's as if the special effects were paid for with whatever they had in their pockets at the time, which wasn't much.  The blood work is weak and the blood gnomes are less impressive than Muppets.  In one scene we see a blood gnome birth and find out the source behind the drugblood gnome afterbirth from some tentacled abomination.  It's never made clear what these monsters are or where they came from before some drug-dealing dominatrix got a hold of them.  But I guess I'm glad I was spared having to endure any more screen time fumbling through a poorly rendered explanation.

The effects are weak, but later in the movie the blood gnome attacks become marginally entertaining and much more frequent.
I'd have to recommend that you skip this one.",1397952000,,2582,4.844748858447488

8009360,1,B0001AVZX0,"what is this?

more importantly, WHY is this?

i think my brain cells have just been destroyed. being drunk isn't enough to make it through this movie. mocking isn't enough to make it through this movie. there were a lot of nice boobs, but you can see those anywhere, it is not enough to save this movie.

the only moment of competent acting is when danny boy was pretending to be crazy and sounded very drunk, apparently that actor has a lot of experience talking in altered states of mind.

bloodsport and BONDAGE AND DOMINATION and for some reason the gnomes need people to be either horny or scared AND to have blood drawn before they eat them i don't i can't they're born out of a large vagina dentata and THEY ARE THE DRUGS and oh god

there is no pacing to be spoken of, the climax happens in the last three minutes of the film and just nothing i keep asking myself ""what is the point of this scene"" ""why is this here"" ""suicide is a viable life decision""

watch this movie if you're a masochist. i can't recommend it to anyone else.

on the other hand, if you want to be immortal, watch bloodgnome, time will never end you will be young forever",1391817600,,1151,4.300925925925926
8009361,3,B0001AVZX0,Bad acting? Yes. Cheesy story line? Yes. Gratuitous nudity? Yes.  Don't expect much from this movie other than a few laughs really. I happen to like older cheesy movies so this didn't phase me. It can come off as low budget skinimax though so it's not really for younger viewers. I will saw the cover misled me at first as the gnomes don't really look like that. I won't say much more for those that are bold enough to give this a shot. If you're adult enough to watch this with a group of friends that aren't phased by the nudity and BDSM you could all pick on it for fun. I already recommended it to a friend ;) .,1385164800,,615,4.125
8009362,3,B0001AVZX0,"This is an effort that aspires to be a B-movie and does a credible job of it.  It is certainly well ahead of many other contenders.  If this is the worst movie other reviewers have seen, then they are in for a rude shock.  Blood Gnome has monsters, nudity, some good looking girls, with an appealing female lead, gore (if you're into that sort of thing, I'm not), a kinda goofy looking hero, coherent storyline,  reasonably decent plot concept overall.  Not many low-budget horror can claim all that.  It's not Gone With the Wind, but then I never cared for Gone With the Wind -- a chick flick with hoop skirts.  This is more my style, and doesn't make me want to blowtorch my eyes out during it like some Italian horror flicks.  Good making of featurette, as well.  Worth adding to your collection of low budget horror.",1288569600,,820,4.486486486486487
8009363,2,B0001AVZX0,"This movie has some good things going for it. I like the concept of monsters you can see on camera but not with the naked eye and there was some good atmosphere.

8009364,2,B0001AVZX0,"This was just a VERY soft porn. You hardly see anything in this movie that would make it a horror movie.
