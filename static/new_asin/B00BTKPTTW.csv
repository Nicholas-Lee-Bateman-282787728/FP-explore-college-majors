5672935,5,B00BTKPTTW,"While inevitably associated with the Beats, Lawrence Ferlinghetti's life has encompassed far more than that influential literary & cultural movement, to which he contributed so much. In this fine documentary, Ferlinghetti's overall life & work are introduced to the general viewer in loving detail. I've been a devotee since my discovery of his seminal ""A Coney Island of the Mind"" nearly 50 years ago; but in this film I learned a lot that I hadn't known about the man, particularly about his early life. What a story in itself! Dickens might have written such twists & turns -- and these illuminate the path Ferlinghetti's life would take in the following decades.

But the major part of the film is more than mere biography, however fascinating. What we're given is a real sense of the man: his work not only as poet & publisher, but as painter, political activist, and cultural critic. What's especially striking is his warmth & sense of humor, which he often uses to make some scathing political points, but which seems to be an essential part of the man & his full-hearted engagement with life & art. His history with both the Beats & the counterculture is given considerable examination, as that's what most people will undoubtedly think of first. But as we see, there's always been a lot more going on ... and still is, even as Ferlinghetti ages well into his 90s. And it's clear that he has indeed aged well. We should all have such grace & humor as we grow older!

Of course the immediate audience for this film will be followers of the Beats, the avant-garde, the counterculture. But the viewer who knows little or nothing of such things should also find it quite compelling in its portrait of an individual, someone who has lived as honestly & creatively as any man could hope to do. I hesitate to use a hackneyed word like ""inspirational"" but in this case it really does apply -- not mawkish, saccharine ""inspiration"" but the real thing, encouraging viewers to pursue art & beauty on their own, and to enlarge their own lives.

Most highly recommended!",1373500800,6,2065,4.7465181058495824

8573718,4,B00BTKPTTW,This is a very good documentary about Ferlinghetti. I read a couple of his books years ago but hadn't really kept up with him and didn't know he was so political. It is quite amazing that he has kept City Lights Bookstore and Publishing up for so long. Some of Ferlinghetti's paintings are also shown as well as much poetry read. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the Beats or poetry in general as Ferlinghetti has really kept this indispensable and yet often ignored aspect of culture alive. Actually I would like to have heard a little more about Ferlinghetti's political and philosophical views as what is here is very intriguing.,1458259200,,646,4.725663716814159

8573721,5,B00BTKPTTW,"Only time will tell if Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and his Beat poet cohorts, wrote timeless words during the hip-swiveling Elvis era.

At best, Ferlinghetti, and the Beats, are a sign of the times, 1950s; At worse, he and his crowd are simply, pretentious light-paper-weight fluff stuff. This doc, directed by Christopher Felver, makes a strong case for Ferlinghetti's poetry tour de force, his poetic oomph. In a nutshell, this doc reflects his life. At 96 years old, he has lived a bountiful life, indeed; he has seen many roads. From World War II, man on the moon, to pop culture icons like Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, JD Salinger, Michael Jackson to cable TV, Ferlinghetti has lived through it all. And this doc shows he's still here, living the here and now at 96. Quite remarkable.

Now, after all these years, he's on this video A Rebirth of Wonder, recorded in 2009. To say the least, Ferlinghetti is quite amazing as detailed in this doc. Plus he's a highly talented poet. He's a clever, profound wordsmith.

Presently, at 96, he's still connected to his City Lights bookstore, and its publishing company, both based in San Francisco, his home turf. He never quits living as this documentary aptly shows. He's a relic, and at the same time, he's not a relic. He's still sassy, rambunctious, filled with a devil-may-care attitude. This doc shows, and describes it all: how in the heck he got here, and why he is not leaving?

So impressed with this doc, I looked up his poems. Upon reading a few, I stopped in awe. He's a poet of ideas. A very talented one. Some poets rhyme madly; he thinks madly. He's an original treasure in American culture. He's the type of dude who will tell the emperor he's wearing no clothes. Sassy guts. As a poet, it works for him.

In the long run, nonetheless, good poetry is timeless. Shakespeare is timeless, Arthur Rimbaud is timeless, Shelley is timeless, Is Ferlinghetti timeless, this doc claims he is. Who knows? Only time will tell.

At 96, he would still have to wait a long time to find out how transcendent his poems truly are. This doc, however, lends support to his poetic gift. This doc interviewed fellow talented poets like Billy Collins, Michael McClure and Amiri Baraka. Plus pop culture icons poet/songwriter Bob Dylan, and 60s, 70s movie actor Dennis Hopper. All lavish praise upon him.

Overall, this doc is more about Ferlinghetti than the Beats. Allen Ginsburg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso are mentioned. Though, with reason, none of them are interviewed. Those Beats are long gone from this mortal coil. None have lived as long as Ferlinghetti. He has outlived all of them. He beat the Beats in life longevity.

That makes Ferlinghetti the king of the Beats. Long live the king. Nevertheless, by himself without the Beats, he is an interesting man. That combined with the Beats, he has an interesting past. Interesting enough to dedicate a documentary to his legacy.

Overall, watching this doc was a wonder. It was a rebirth of wonder, since I had thought the 50s were long gone, faded away in yesteryear, nostalgia memory lane. This doc, however, stirred, in me, a want to watch Elvis Presley videos to experience the 50s.

I wanted to see what life was like back them, when the new culture was still new: when both, Elvis and Marilyn wiggled their hips. All seen on the screen.

 And Ferlinghetti was there. And is still here, circa  2015. Quite an amazing poet and documentary.",1447286400,3,3434,4.760942760942761
8573722,5,B00BTKPTTW,"Yeah, you know at some very young age, well before puberty, most of us get our natural stock of wonder beaten out of us, wonder at the world, wonder about why this is this way and that is that way, and the funny makeup of the nature of the universe, hell, just plain ordinary vanilla wonder. That is why poets, good and bad, are precious commodities in restoring the human balance, in letting us once more check in on the wonder game which their words, their particular scheme of words since they have not had their sense of wonder beaten out of them (no matter how hard in individual cases someone might have tried). Every self-respecting radical or progressive in some other field like, for example, Karl Marx in political theory has treasured their friendships with the poets, and rightly so no matter how quirky they get. That quirkiness and the precious commodity of wonder get a full workout by one self-described anarchist poet, Lawrence Ferlinghett as his lifes story unfolds in the documentary under review, Lawrence Ferlinghetti: A Rebirth Of Wonder.

Today perhaps not as many people outside of the San Francisco Bay area may be as familiar with the work of Ferlinghetti, although A Coney Island of the mind is one of the best selling poetry collection ever, and this film makes some amends for that short-coming. Of course the Ferlinghetti name might become more familiar in some circles if you put the name with the City Lights bookstore that he founded and which is still going strong today as a central haven for creative spirits in the area. Or for legal buffs and aficionados his connection with the pornography free of expression suit brought in the 1950s around publication of Allen Ginsburgs Howl. That connection between poet and bookstore owner get plenty of exposure here as it should since it is hard to think of say Allen Ginsberg or Gregory Corso two poets active in that same period combining those two skills.

This film, since it doubles up as a short biopic as well as cultural artifact gives plenty of information about the long bumpy ride for Ferlinghetti to first begin unleashing his poetic visions and then tie those words into a new left-wing (as mentioned above, anarchist if anybody is asking) way of looking at society. Not so strangely a lot of his emergence as a poet and central cultural figure was connected when he hit San Francisco in the early 1950s. If  he had found himself in lets say Cleveland at that time things might have turned out very differently for Frisco along with the Village in New York were oases against the prevailing cookie-cutter, keep your head down, Cold War red scare night where the misfits and renegades found shelter and kindred.

Of course beside the poetic vision and the bookstore as cultural expression Ferlinghetti, as the film also makes clear, was one of those behind the scenes players who make new cultural explosions happen. He was, although not a beat poet himself (his take on the question) and although he was not a hippie poet either he was a central figure in both movements as be-bop beat gave way to acid-etched hippie-dom. Something I did not know was how many places like May 1968 in Paris and 1959 in Cuba he had been involved with which surely affected the weight of his more political poems. And in the end his prolific run of poetry in all sizes and shapes, especially the now classic A Coney Island of the Mind will be the legacy, will be that little slice of wonder future generations will cling to.",1423872000,,3497,4.709150326797386

This is a fabulous and comprehensive and moving documentary.  What fun to see Ferlinghetti's cabin at Big Sur and to revisit his special friends such as Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, and Jack Kerouac!  Ferlinghetti's landmark poem ""Rebirth of Wonder"" inspired us to completely change our lives twice and continues to inspire us to embrace creativity!",1423094400,,509,5.35
