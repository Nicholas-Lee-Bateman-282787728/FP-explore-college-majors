4375062,5,B004H1UAIA,"I just finished Robert K. Massie's book, Nicholas and Alexandra, and this documentary was a perfect compliment to the book. To see images of the time period and the Tsar and his family, knowing what was coming, was both fascinating and very sad.",1350950400,9,245,4.72093023255814
4375063,4,B004H1UAIA,"I enjoyed this dvd, the archival footage itself makes it worth it. The dvd is well researched and accurate, and looks at not only the life of Nicholas the Second but at contemporary ( well 1990s) Russia and its revival of some Tsarist sentimenal aspects. The narrative can be a little fragmented as it moves from pre-revolutionary Russia to 90s Russia, but overall it's interesting and enjoyable. It ends with the retrieval of the bodies from the forest outside Ekaterinburg. later research establsihed via DNA the accuracy of the remains- the doco only touches on this. Well worth it.",1300752000,21,585,4.91919191919192

8429244,5,B004H1UAIA,"Excellent documentary on a truly good man. Great video and interviews. I would recommend this DVD  to anyone interested in the history of Tsarist Russia. If this tsar had survived, the world in my opinion would have been a better and safer place to live.",1483488000,,254,4.644444444444445
8429245,3,B004H1UAIA,"This program had some interesting film footage on the private lives of the Romanovs.  But because this program was designed as a one-hour TV show, It did not go into the depth other programs have.  The relationship between Nicholas and Alexandra was much complex, and the influence of Rasputin over the Czarina was considerable and needed to be explored in greater detail.  Also, the program stopped at the point the remains were discovered and disinterred.  No mention was made of the burial of the remains by the Russian  Orthodox Church.
But the program is entertaining, and if the viewer has no previous knowledge of the Romanovs, this program will give them a good basic background.",1482624000,,687,4.939130434782609
8429246,5,B004H1UAIA,"An interesting portrayal of the last Tsar of Russia, his family and how they came to be assassinated. This was tragic no doubt to kill an entire family.",1480291200,,152,4.464285714285714

8429249,5,B004H1UAIA,"THE irony is that next  July 2016 on the day THE entre imperial family was murdered, a huge memorial ceremony will be held. I forgot whether it's in London or St. Petersburg. Including the bones they found in the Urals. Through DNA with the living relaties living in THE U.K. It was established THE bones are real",1449273600,,313,4.491228070175438
