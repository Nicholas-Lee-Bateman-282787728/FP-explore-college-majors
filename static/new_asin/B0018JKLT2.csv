3417602,5,B0018JKLT2,"Just because it's commercial does not mean it is conventional :)

I bought this film after seeing the first two installments of the Suicide Club Trilogy and Strange Circus, not really on impulse, rather, the idea that Sion Sono is my new idol, at least before going into this one... and then after, he cemented his standing!  This is a new style compared to the others, and while it has a different look, a different feel, it still hits home with some of the original mind games as well as the killer story telling.

Initially, I was a bit turned away from this movie by both the premise and the reviews/previews, but loving both horror films and Sion Sono's work, I decided to give it a try, and I'll be the first to admit, there is some misleading stuff out there.

As you can probably guess, this isn't strictly one genre or another, but where most films that travel between genres fall astray and feel awkward, Ekusute floats gracefully though being a Thriller, Horror, Comedy, and Drama, all at the same time, which is probably a large part of its loss for appeal based upon descriptions... it's hard to capture it completely.

The story itself is quirky... expect an assortment of characters that are very unique, some personable, some bizarre, some distasteful, but all well rounded and enjoyable.  The story itself is offbeat, but draws you in and keeps you there.  There are several stories running at the same time, all separate and connected in their own way, but blended masterfully.  There are several disturbing scenes, many comical moments, dramatic segments, touching times, a flow of suspense, and in the end... you'll have to see :)  It does not disappoint, though I'd be reluctant to label it a horror film, because, you'll laugh through a great portion, maybe when you shouldn't be, but it's inevitable!

The actors all did a great job too, pulling off their roles to an off-beat tee.  Chiaki Kuriyama, the lead, does a good job, this being the first role I've seen her as pleasant and charming all the way through; it was a nice change, and good to see her smiling!  Miku Sato plays the abused daughter-in-law/sister-of-sorts and does great!  .  Kiyomi Mizushima, who you'll recognize as Kumiko from ""Noriko's Dinner Table"", is truly despicable; playing the sister that looks charming but has a sinister personality.  Ren Osugi plays Yamazaki, and is so wildly out of his mind, he sets a new precedent for hair-fetish movie psychos, and many other psychos, too!!!  You'll probably spot several other familiar faces, so keep your eyes peeled!

The DVDs themselves are great in this package.  You get Disk One with the Movie, film trailer, and a couple other trailers for other films, the basics of any Disk One, but then in Disk Two there is a ""Music Video"" (which, by the way, would make the set worth it by itself), TV Spots (basically a bunch [no joke, a lot] of short commercials), Deleted Scenes, a Behind The Scenes, and a Q&A with Sion Sono himself.  The film itself comes with 4 Audio Tracks: 2 English and 2 Japanese, and while the English Dub is par with any English Dubbing, the Japanese track is really what you should be listening to...

All and all, it's a great, crazy film with a nice release, and you can't ask for more, despite the fact that you'll be left wanting a lot more!  We'll have to see where Sion Sono goes in the future, hopefully, very, very far!",1219622400,5,3396,4.6644295302013425
3417603,4,B0018JKLT2,"EXTE HAIR EXTENSIONS (aka. Ekusete) is the latest offering from director Sion Sono; whose most successful works include the cult classic ""Suicide Club""(winner of ""Most Groundbreaking film""), and ""Strange Circus""(Grand Jury Prize winner and Best Actress). ""Exte: Hair Extensions"" was featured in the ""Fantasia Film Fest"" and expectations were very high for Sono's latest film. Sion Sono is a poetic director, and while this film captures a lot of established formulas that have been reminiscent in Asian Horror films, it doesn't make it any less effective as a Horror-Dark Fantasy hybrid.

Synopsis partly derived from dvd back cover:
Yamazaki (Ren Osugi) is a morgue janitor obsessed with beautiful hair. One evening, a female victim of illegal organ harvesting was transferred to the morgue. Obsessed with the body's hair, he stole the corpse for his own personal amusement. Surprisingly, the hair continues to grow from the dead body and occupied Yamazaki's house...
Meanwhile, a young aspiring hair stylish named Yuko (Chiaki Kuriyama, Kill Bill) is training at a local salon called ""Gilles De Rais"" under its head stylist (Yamamoto Mirai). Her world is about to be turned upside down when her sister, Tsugumi (Kiyomi Mizushima) leaves her daughter Mami (Sato Miku) under her care. Mami is a victim of child abuse, Tsugumi is an uncaring mother more concerned about getting drunk and spending time with her lover. Yuko, her decision supported by her roommate, Yuki (Megumi Sato) become adamant to keep Mami away from her abusive birth mother.
One day, Yamazaki shows up at Yuko's salon and gives the workers samples of natural hair extensions. Although, the hair is lovely and very enchanting, the hair is cursed by an evil spirit. The vengeful force bedevils anyone who wears them by manipulating the hair follicles in every part of the human body--the hair will grow...

The screenplay by Sono (Strange Circus, Noriko's Dinner Table) and co-writer Adachi Masaki (co-director of Ju-On) may seem to be a rethread of other movies concerning possessed body parts such as ""The Hand"", the K-horror: ""The Wig"" and ""The Eye"". It may be a ridiculously contrived plot at first impression, but if you know this director, you'll understand his motivations. Asian horror has been plagued by the vengeful long-haired ghost so the director decides to ""extend"" its concept to the extreme. Sono expresses the idea of killer hair extensions to a frightening concept and pushes its limits, that delivers an uneasy feeling. The film is also a subtle way of ridiculing the usual trappings that J-horror has fallen into, in a humorously twisted way.

There are some graphically creepy sequences as the possessed hair takes over one's body. Hair would grow from all parts of the body, eyelids, eyeballs, tongues and fingertips; body parts are decapitated with razor-sharp precision. The ways of hair torture are on display as Sono manipulates our senses with visual manipulation that borders on being absurdly twisted and at times, cartoonish. Blood and some gore is omnipresent, as the killer hair extensions move on their own accord, killing people who are full of vanity, but not that much that it would turn off viewers. However, if you want honesty, the abused child subplot is actually the film's most effective asset. Tsugumi is truly a mother from ""hades"", played by Kiyomi Mizushima with convincing fervor, you can't help but have a lot of hatred for her character. Mima's mother is the true monster in this film, she is cold, heartless and selfish. Tsugumi's character makes Yamazaki's over-the-top eccentric, campy villainy look like he's Uncle Scrooge.

The dead girl in the container may lack (ahem) character development. We see her past in the form of flashbacks, as seen by the hair's victims but the film never does provide any solid explanation as to who she is or why she could hold such unholy supernatural power. Glimpses of Yamazaki's past is on display as to why he is so obsessed with hair but his character is a bit too comical to generate any interest. Chiaki Kuriyama pulls off a decent performance for the most part, but the most stellar performance falls to Miku Sato who plays Mami, the abused child. Miku Sato is so convincing with her role as Mami that the audience would definitely feel her ordeal. Mami is a child very afraid, and Sato gives her character a lot of life, the child actress bears her soul to portray her character.

Overall, ""Exte Hair Extensions"" may not be as good as ""Ringu"" or ""Ju-On"". The film leaves a lot of questions unanswered that left me asking for more. This film is Sono's most commercial film outing and too mainstream for my tastes, but it is a decent thriller. The director presents all the trappings reminiscent to other Japanese horror formulas, and puts them all together for his purpose. There isn't a lot of emotional strength in this latest film when compared with Sono's awesome ""Strange Circus"" and the climax may leave you with a lack of closure. The film is very ""viewer-friendly"" and easier to grasp than his other movies. Sono undoubtedly just wants to make a film that is for mainstream audiences as Takashi Miike did with ""One Missed Call"". ""Exte Hair Extensions"" is creepy, sometimes goofy and comical, but definitely cool as ice.

8269819,5,B0018JKLT2,"The product is great. The movie is unique, very rare. Who could say that just a hair extensions can produce so many emotions and  many creepy moments...It happen in this story. Seems the music for this movie was chosen carefully. I still can remember those sweet lullabies amid scenes of terror making those moments even more frightening. I really like Hair Extensions and I recommend it.",1473897600,,388,4.878787878787879

8269822,4,B0018JKLT2,"Very well done intentionally ""b-rated"" horror flick. Perfect amount of violence, humor, and just plain bizarre elements. The music is great, the cast is great, and the story is so out of the ordinary and enjoyable. This film will make you laugh, while making you cringe at the same time. A must for fans of the japanese horror genre.",1423612800,,333,4.661016949152542
8269823,3,B0018JKLT2,"This was a fairly bizarre film. The cover of the box pretty much tells the whole story except for the ending. Hair grown from a murdered girl, apparently used for organ harvesting, is sold by a morgue worker for hair extensions. The hair has magical deadly powers as out beauticians fight for their lives.

The film subject matter was unique and the special effects were good. Our ""Kill Bill"" girl is more of a cream puff in this film having to combat with a beautician's scissors instead of a mace.

Not for everyone.

Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. Minor corpse nudity.",1404864000,,566,4.64

8269825,3,B0018JKLT2,"If you're looking for the next Ringu, you will probably leave this film being disappointed. That's the mindset I came into this film with & I ended up leaving somewhat disappointed, somewhat pleased by this film.

The film's premise is so bizarre that you can't help but be curious. The idea of killer hair is one that hasn't been done very often so there's no worries about this film falling into too many cliches. They're here, but when you add the whole ""hair extensions will kill you"" factor into it those cliches become something new. When you add on the true horror aspect of the movie, the abuse of a small child, the film becomes truly cringe worthy.

It's just that at the same time, this film wasn't particularly great. At times I got the impression that the director was deliberately trying to make a B movie, which both helped & hurt the film. It also doesn't help that the film just dragged at times & felt longer than it's hour & a half time. The acting in the film is very well done for a film of this nature(the abusive mother giving one of the best performances in the film) & the plot is well done enough, but it just can't save itself from itself.

I do recommend watching it, if only for the strangely comedic scene of Yamazaki (the guy selling the hair extensions) dancing around his apartment singing ""Hair, hair"". This is pretty much a rental in my opinion, although I have a feeling I'll probably be netflixing it again come Halloween.",1307923200,,1459,4.49811320754717
8269826,4,B0018JKLT2,"Basically a Japanese B-Movie, a horror movie with hair as a key element.  Low budget, done serious but not too much so. Chiaki Kuriyama is cute, fans of the genre will like it but don't spend too much money to get it.",1233187200,,217,4.166666666666667
