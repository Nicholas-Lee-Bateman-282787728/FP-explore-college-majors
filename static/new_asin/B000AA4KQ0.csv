2383175,5,B000AA4KQ0,"My Husband bought me Season 1-8 for Christmas.  My Kids Love them, including my son who is 15.  We finished watching them all this July(05) & It was my son who suggested we start over again!  His behavior has improved since Little House, he was a good boy before.  I think seeing is believing for teens, just parents telling him how we as humans should be just wasn't enough.  My kids are begging me to by more seasons of Little House!  Little house is Good Wholesome Fun Entertainment!  You gotta Love & Hate Harriet & Nelly those two are a trip! My ""12"" daughter also learned about how to deal with ""teasing"" by ""seeing"" Laura with Nelly! If you are thinking on collecting these seasons on DVD...DO...they are so much better without the commercials!  Buy & Enjoy!  Mom age 36",1125619200,23,777,4.492857142857143

2383247,2,B000AA4KQ0,"I guess I would give this a fair rating, since they did try to continue, and there were a couple of cute things. However, when the reruns air on Hallmark channel, I don't usually watch the ninth season, past the first episode, when Charles was all packed up,while going down memory lane in their 'little house,' and Laura walked in. That scene between them was SO touching!!!! Unfortunately, once ma and pa were gone, the show lost everything it once was. That feeling that grabs you. For most of the shows, the main actors gave me such a feeling of caring, as I could feel their pain, and joy. There has never been another program that could grab me like that. It was sad that Michael Landon died, because I so looked up to him, growing up. He was a sensational actor, writer and director. God bless him for what he brought to us with ""Little House on the Prairie!""
I believe with ""Little House: A New Beginning,"" that the acting abilities were no longer there. However, Shannon Daugherty did administer some acting talent. One reason I knew that the 'new beginning' was not going to work for me, was when the new family moved into the Ingalls house, and the woman cried to her husband, ""Promise me we're not going to have to move again."" That did not grab me at all, in fact, I was thinking, ""Who cares if she has to move again?"" Most of the new actors on the show just didn't have what it takes to grab the audience, in the same way as the show once did.
Recently, I've been collecting some of my favorite ""Little House on the Prairie"" episodes, and seasons. There is one which I would recommend, that came out towards the end of the series. There are three ""little house"" movies. It is a special collectors edition, and a boxed set of the five DVD's. The movies included are, ""Look back to yesterday,"" in which Charles and Albert return to Walnut Grove for a visit, and Albert was very sick. The second movie, ""Bless all the dear children,"" when baby Rose is kidnapped. Third one, ""The Last Farewell,"" is most touching, because it was the final ""little house,"" where the town has to ban together, since the actual property owner of Walnut Grove, is going to take over the town. Michael Landon and Karen Grassle appeared for the final one. I love that set, all three movies are excellent!! There are two bonus DVD's; an interview with Melissa Gilbert, and the casting director explains why each of the cast members were chosen. I would highly recommend that One!!!",1423094400,2,2467,4.508928571428571

2383295,5,B000AA4KQ0,"This is the final season of Little House on the Prairie.  It is a shortened season.  The producers planned to end it in Season 8, but popular demand opened it for another season.

Having another hard winter, Charles Ingalls has finally decided to give up on farming.  He sold the little house and moved is family to Iowa (sound familiar?)  To replace the departing Ingalls' family, John and Sarah Carter buy the house along with their two sons, Jeb and Jason.  But nobody can replace the Ingalls'.  The family was nice enough, but they didn't get the ratings Charles and Caroline got.

Laura and Almanzo became the main characters.  Laura was out-spoken and hyper like her father.  The writer's made Almanzo almost speachless until near the end of the season.  I was saddened by this fact because I LOVED Almanzo's hot personality!

Mr. Edwards is also in the opening credits and has become a big part of this show.

My favorite episodes:
Times Are Chaning
Rage
The Wild Boy
The Return of Nellie
Alden's Dilemna
The Older Brothers
Home Again

I enjoy the characters and will definitely be holding on to the entire series for any children to watch because the concept of family-friendly TV is going downhill fast...

The sound quality is not as good past season 6 and I've not been able to get closed captions to work (the packaging up to season 6 indicates closed caption available); still unsure whether it's a disc issue or a TV issue, but if you require CC I'd recommend checking up on this before purchase.",1378080000,,734,4.603053435114504

When a series becomes successful it tends to follow a formula. After a while viewers tend to drift away for a change. The producers react to this by changing the formula. If it doesn't increase the number of viewers the series will end. One change is to add or drop actors or characters to see if this increases viewers. There are few series that go over nine years without some type of changes. Other factors can affect a series. Actors may become unavailable, fashions change. This package has a symbolic black cover. Do these stories follow the path set in the earlier seasons? This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the 22 shows.

2383370,5,B000AA4KQ0,"In Season 9 ""Little House on the Prairie"" went through many changes. The title was renamed, ""Little House: A New Beginning."" Then the cast changed, drastically. Charles and his family moved to the city and the little house saw a new family. The Wilder's took in their orphan-niece, Jenny; played by a very young 90210-star, Shannen Doherty. Even though Michael Landon wasn't in every ep, his spirit could be seen in every single show!

This was the last season. Over the next couple of years there were 3 TV movies produced, which are sometimes called Season 10; however that is technically incorrect.

As usual, Doc Baker tells Charles that no apology is necessary. That same day at school Albert goes berserk. He beats up the Carter boy and even clocks poor Miss Plumb in the face!

2383386,5,B000AA4KQ0,"Being a first generation Little House fan, I remember the first run episodes of this series, including the 9th full season.  Charles and Caroline are gone, the Little House taken over by the Carters, but Laura and Almanzo are still there.  The stories are enthralling, family friendly, heartwarming, sad, funny...everything that Little House is famous for!!  This season does full justice to Michael Landon's legacy to Laura Ingalls Wilder and we have some great entertaining moments here.  My favorite episode is ""May I Have This Dance"" where a charming Willie Oleson comes of age and marries a sweet girl named Rachel.  The scene where he tells Mrs. Oleson off is priceless.  Its obvious he's becoming more and more like his father and not the annoying little pest he was when he was little.  Melissa Gilbert and Dean Butler more than hold their own as the true de-facto stars here, but the Carter family is very engaging and appealing.  Any true Little House fan will enjoy this season just as much as the others.  I now have my Little House collection complete and Season Nine is one of my favorites!

2383391,5,B000AA4KQ0,"In season 9 of ""Little House,"" the series is re-titled ""Little House, A New Beginning,"" as Michael Landon and Karen Grassle leave the series, and Melissa Gilbert and Dean Butler become the new lead actors as Laura and Almonzo. With Laura as the only member of the Ingalls family remaining in Walnut Grove, the series did lose many fans who could not accept the absence of Charles and Caroline, and the rest of the Ingalls children. The Carter family moves into the Ingalls' old home, but it is never quite the same. This season Alison Arngrim makes a welcome guest appearance in ""The Return of Nellie."" However, while this is Alison's final appearance as Nellie, she has a cameo as a phone operator in the series finale, ""The Last Farewell."" We also see the return of Charles and Albert Ingalls in the two-part episode ""Home Again,"" where Albert is battling a morphine addiction. This season's finale, ""Hello And Goodbye,"" is the last time we see the character of Mrs. Oleson, as she does not appear in any of the final three movies. We await the DVD release of the final three movies, ""Look Back To Yesterday""(which also features the return of Charles and Albert), ""Bless All The Dear Children,"" and the series finale ""The Last Farewell,"" which tragically ends with the destruction of Walnut Grove.

Michael Landon has always been one of my favorite people, and I feel that he would have been the same in person if I would have had the opportunity to meet him as he was on the screen!  But Laura is the main character throughout the whole series, and her life goes on!  All of Walnut Grove's personality still lives in this series as it did before.  Personally, I disagree with others who felt that they weren't as good.  But then again, that's what these reviews are all about, right?  Different opinions, so that you can make your own choice!  I wanted them to be part of my library even if they hadn't have been as good, but I found them just as interesting and entertaining as all the rest.",1140998400,6,926,4.281609195402299

The first episode was upsetting because of the changes, but after that, I decided that I was going to open myself up to liking the show. This is still the Little House on the Prairie that you know and love. It's just that the Ingalls family aren't at the core. The Carter family isn't really at the core either. The main focus in on the Wilders and the other supporting cast that we have grown to care for over the past eight seasons (The Olesons, Mr. Edwards, Doc Baker, etc.).

Although Season 9, by far, is not the best of Little House, it does continue to bring good moral lessons and a smile to your face.

Albert's morphine addiction and withdrawal with spewing vomit is a far cry from the fun when Laura put pepper all over Nellie and Almanzo's chicken! Mary, Nellie, PA and MA are all gone so they have the boring Carter family move in to fill the gap.  The series is totally struggling to come up with any story so they recycle some from earlier seasons!!!  The series hits a low point with the absurd orangutan story to the mute boy to the terrible acting of Shannen Doherty. This season is so embarrassing it is simply unwatchable.  Thank got James and Cassandra are gone!  Michael Landon should have ended this show after baby Rose Wilder was born.  Shame on Landon for destroying this once awesome show!",1135123200,8,814,4.65034965034965
2383412,5,B000AA4KQ0,"Landon's true last season was defintely Season 8 and he basically took over the story lines and directing duties for Season 9. His gray hair must have been the deciding factor! Just kidding. Karen Grassle (Mrs. Ingalls) is nowhere to be found, Carrie Ingalls, Mary, Adam Kendall... vanished...Landon (Mr. Ingalls) starts out in the opening episode and returns for a very ""morbid episode with Albert in the midlde of the season"" It must be said though although the most beloved character is gone, the charm and satisfaction of the show is still very much intact.  Landon's directing abilities certainly shine as the stories do not seem old and rehashed from past years.

Season 9 is truly a ""New Beginning"" as the characters have certainly evolved, and there are newbies galore. Shannon Daughtery is an amazing little actor in this series as I couldn't believe it was her when I popped it in my DVD player. I think I liked her better as a little girl!  Isaiah Edwards, (Victor French) has once again became one of the main characters for the series and is with the season througout the stay. Laura and Almonzo are still around along with classics such as Nels, Harriet, Nancy and Wily, Willy Olesen, Dr. Baker and the Reverend Alden are still here. I think this is the last Season we get to enjoy the antics of Harriet (McGreggor) as I don't believe she reprises her role in Season 10.  The stories still seem (and manage) to touch the heart like they did in the earlier seasons and still draws tears to fans. How they can make a story about a strayed babboon in Walnut Grove and make it enjoyable is beyond me, but it's successful no matter how you cut it.

The most gut wrenching and disturbing 2-part episode is with the return of Albert and Charles Ingalls.  It's the most morbid episode ever for the series and is almost to the point of being inappropriate for younger viewers. The moral is certainly ""drugs will ruin your life, so don't do drugs!"" Albert is addicted to Morphine, and the show puts you through his vomiting, convulsions, hallucinations, his severe withdrawl and the battle with his father to save his life. Can the great and powerful Charles Ingalls save him one last time? Great entertainment, allbeit a bit morbid.

Fans of the series should still buy this, It's not the best season by any means, most of the classic characters are gone, but the show still manages to rock thanks to continued great storylines and fine acting. It's still one of the betters forms of entertainment that should be on everyone's shelf for years to come.",1133827200,38,2556,4.679287305122495
2383413,5,B000AA4KQ0,"When this 9th season debuted in 1983 with a shocking and disappointing decision to eliminate the Ingalls clan and relocate them to Burr Oak, Iowa, this year's premiere episode was undoubtedly a moment where some previously loyal audiences were lost. Others stuck with the current story and did their best to enjoy it for what it was, but for the most part, it was perceived as a weak, unsettling conclusion to a long-running, highly beloved television series.

Not too many viewers will be quick to buy Charles as a man who leaves behind his farming lifestyle to become a store merchant and provide more stability for his wife and younger children, but regardless of that, Michael Landon opted for a bittersweet ending to the Ingalls story arc that established the series as lighthearted, pleasing television for a full eight years. In addition, not only did the Ingalls pack up their covered wagon and leave Walnut Grove for good, but they sold their little wooden house--which Charles built with his own hands back in Season 1--to a blacksmith, his wife, and their two young sons. That's right--from here on out, the Carter family entered the plot and joined what would soon become an ensemble cast of old and new characters.

The good news is that Laura and her husband Almanzo remained in the mix, and Melissa Gilbert was catapulted to ""leading lady"" stardom. I must say, it is nice to see her blossom this year as a full-fledged, mature adult, not just a newlywed on the brink of womanhood that we saw in Seasons 7 and 8. Now, after being married for a couple years and enduring several harsh realities connected to marriage, Laura is a strong, credible character who cares for her family and allows us to see just how much she has grown since she was a buck-toothed, tomboyish 8-year-old in the pilot movie nearly a decade ago. Also, because her and Almanzo's baby daughter Rose was not school-aged and could not yet assume the role of an older child on the show, Laura and Almanzo needed an older child to care for as they established themselves as the kind of loving, guiding parents that Charles and Caroline Ingalls were in years past. For that purpose, in comes Jenny Wilder, a bright-eyed, cheery 10-year-old who comes to live with her aunt and uncle in the wake of her widowed father Royal's tragic death. (And yes, folks, Royal Wilder appeared previously with his scatterbrained wife and two sons in Season 7, but Michael Landon had a new plan in mind by the time this season came around, and preserving continuity meant absolutely nothing to him as he completely rewrote Royal's story for the sake of convenience.) Played by a very young Shannen Doherty (whose Lindsay Lohan-type behavior in her teen years is well recognized by those who keep up with the tabloids), Jenny is a surprisingly effective asset to the series. Sweet, genuine, and widely effervescent, nothing about Doherty's acting is artificial as she develops the character in her own unique way. Some may say that Jenny was a poor substitute for the long-gone image of Laura as a child, but I don't think so. Say what you want about her, but she had some real talent as a little girl, and it's easy to see how she made it into the business in the first place. She was a good choice in the casting department, and episodes like ""Times are Changing"" and ""Marvin's Gardens"" are a nice showcase for what the girl was able to do at 11 years old.

Then comes the slew of familiar and unfamiliar faces of ""Little House,"" where nobody is really the ""star"" of the show, but again, it is more like an illustration of the community that is Walnut Grove. Nels and Harriet Oleson continue along with their virtually unforgettable roles, and with Willie turning into a young man and Nancy wreaking havoc every chance she gets, these parents have a lot to help keep them on their toes (and even their beloved Nellie returns for one episode)! Mr. Edwards steps up to keep a protecting eye on Laura in her own Pa's absence, and as he becomes a father figure to several people in town, he adopts a child named Matthew and must learn how to avoid compensating with alcohol and reclusion when things don't go exactly as planned.

Michael Landon's daughter Leslie portrays the young woman who replaces homemaker Laura as the new teacher of Walnut Grove, and Reverend Alden and Doc Baker continue to add their same memorable touch to each episode. And of course, the Carters assume residence in the Ingalls' old house and round out the new cast. Seeing them in the house is a noticeable difference, to be sure, but setting obvious grievances aside, there is plenty to like about this family. They soon became some of my very favorite characters in this season, if not the entire series, and I only wish we could have seen a little bit more of them. Young parents John and Sarah are a loving couple with enough charm to carry any plot that they are given, and while newspaper editor Sarah is relatively underdeveloped, blacksmith John Carter projects a sincerity and consciousness of what is right, making him a welcome addition as a leading male character. If you think he's just a cheap imitation of Charles Ingalls, think again: John has a much calmer and quieter presence than Charles, and while Charles undoubtedly never held back in throwing a defensive punch when necessary, John is more the type who looks for the good and keeps himself as collected as possible in various situations. As for their sons Jeb and Jason, they are cute kids who don't necessarily have to be viewed as ""male versions of Laura and Mary"" (you'd be surprised at what some hard-core fans came up with once the Ingalls were written out of the show). Jeb is mostly just average, but little Jason, played by David Friedman, is probably the sweetest breath of fresh air in the newfound image of this season, and as the Carters became more recognized in the plot, Jason quickly became the ""go-to kid"" for several moments of comic relief (as you may have already guessed, I am talking about the darker episodes that Michael Landon did not shy away from, particularly in the show's later years). ""The Last Summer,"" which paired Friedman with seasoned actress Vera Miles, was a standout episode that will require some Kleenexes, and for being so young, Friedman really delivered as a kid with the ability to make you smile every time he was on-screen. It's too bad he retired from the acting business at age 12, just a few years later, because he could have continued to be a fine young actor.

There is no doubt that Season 9 is different from what you saw in Seasons 1-8, but I have to believe that once you get used to the change, you will like it for what it is. Those first eight seasons are available on DVD to watch and enjoy anytime you want, but Season 9 also has a quality that is all its own, and I feel it deserves to be appreciated for that. Humor, poignancy, and occasionally dark episodes represent a classic ""mixed bag"" in this 22-episode collection. Charles Ingalls returns for three episodes, two of which also feature Albert, whose recent problems with shoplifting and morphine present Charles with one of the most horrifying challenges a father can possibly face. I guess you can say that raising adolescent children is always tough, even way back in the pioneer days.

All in all, this is certainly something worth buying to top off your ""Little House"" collection, and the DVD includes a bonus booklet that, in itself, is absolutely worth the entire purchase. Written by Little House series expert Patrick Laboutiere, it contains numerous cast photos, current pictures of several cast members, and information about practically every actor and actress on the show that you can think of, whether their roles were large or minor. It's a terrific resource that will surely provide you with some ""Little House"" trivia that you may never have known about before, so if you're a big fan, don't miss out on owning this. The tone is different in some ways, but the emphasis on the community of Walnut Grove reigns supreme, and you can bet that this was an integral part of what made the show so successful in the first place.",1133654400,,8169,4.697138869504536
2383414,4,B000AA4KQ0,"The ninth season may have been the nail in the coffin, but it's still Little House.  The Wilders, the Olsens and the townsfolk are all still there.  Nellie visits, Willie basically becomes a man,we see Eliza Jane again; some great episodes with Rage, A Child with No Name and Home Again, along with a bit of comic relief in The Older Brothers and For the Love of Blanche.  The extra's are great - especially the A to Z book.  I don't understand the writers bringing Royal Wilder on as not only a different person, but with a different family - that's just strange.  The downfall of season nine is the introduction of the Carters.  John's interaction with Almonzo is fine... but the episodes that focus on the Carter's are... well... boring! I couldn't care less about this family, and wish they had never been brought in.  I have to wonder, who thought they were a good idea? The series could have probably survived another season had it not been for this family.  In true Little House fashion, the house should have just been destroyed by fire or tornado, rather than moving strangers into it.  Oh well! I hope the movies are next on the release horizon.",1132876800,3,1155,4.567961165048544

I loved the interviews with Melissa Gilbert, the Greenbush twins, and Karen Grassle. Plus I learned so much about the real Laura Ingalls, and the exhibits/museums etc. one can visit in the states she lived in. It's all fascinating to me. The real treat was the book which was so wonderfully written, filled with fascinating tidbits and trivia about the making of the series, the actors - and where they are now. It has everything LHOTP from A-Z. I even learned Bandit's 'real' name - but you'll have to buy this set to find out, because I'm not telling. ;) If you're a true Little House devotee, this set is a MUST HAVE.",1132185600,16,746,4.492647058823529

2383421,3,B000AA4KQ0,"""Little House on the Prairie"" regularly took creative license with the story of the Ingalls family and the final season is no exception.  Originally aired as ""Little House: A New Beginning"", the show shifted its focus from the Ingalls family - having moved to Burr Oak, Iowa - to Laura and Almanzo Wilder and several new characters.

Some episodes were entertaining, such as Harriet Oleson nearly owning the entire town after finding a bond in the home of the late town founder Lars Hansen (didn't that house serve as the blind school and burn down?) and forcing the townspeople to let Nancy sing in church and other hilarities.  A passive Nellie Oleson returning, sans Percival, to joke about how horrible she was is amusing for awhile until Nancy starts getting too little attention.  Willie Oleson graduating and getting married in one episode stretches credulity somewhat.

Disturbing is Laura blaming long-time family friend, Doc Baker, for the death of her newborn son.  Additionally, the need of this series to add children by adoption or taking them in after the death of a parent knows no boundaries.  It began with Edwards and his wife adopting three orphans back in the early years (he's a prominent character in season 9, having lost his family because of his drinking problem), then moved on with the Ingalls family adopting street urchin, Albert, who returns this season as a morphine addict.(I'm not sure what's more jarring, watching him go through withdrawal or figuring out how he managed to become a drug addict in 1880's Iowa) and the Cooper brother and sister.  Season 9 starts off with the death of Almanzo's brother, Royal, and the addition of his daughter, Jenny, (We assume that his sons, Rupert and Myron, from a previous season had to fend for themselves) to the Wilder household.

Much of the storylines focus on the Carter family, who bought the Ingalls homestead.  They are non-threatening and their boys wear cute lil ""Little House""-style unisex haircuts, too.  But, the person we want to see develop is Laura.  Unfortunately, besides having a baby die and standing up to creative publishers, we get precious little of our main character.",1130284800,10,2169,4.961325966850829

I've read some of the reviews and some say that it doesn't stand up to some of today's tv shows. Well one thing that I have to say is that I hardly ever watch whats on TV nowadays!! They are all Reality TV shows. Where's the imagination? Where's the morals? I could watch Little house on the Prairie over and over and never get sick of it.

2383427,4,B000AA4KQ0,"In the last season, we see more of the Carters and Wilders than the Ingallses.  You have to wonder why the writers did this; certainly there was a behind-the-scenes reason.  For some viewers, much of the show's charm is missing along with the Ingalls family, but it remains classic, family friendly TV with some truly great moments.  Nellie comes home to envious fireworks from Nancy (her face as she asks Caroline, ""Was I ever that bad?"" is priceless).  The Younger brothers are spoofed with a cheesy humor that is lost on children but makes the episode classic for probably many adults.  Jason Carter befriends a dying lady in maybe the best episode of the season.  Laura pens her first draft of Little House in the Big Woods, wins a writing contest, and concedes the prize when she realizes the publishers intend to change her story.  Isaiah Edwards is perhaps the most poignant character of this season, as he cares for and defends a circus ""wild boy"" (who later leaves town to live with his father) and falls in love only to decide that he's an ""old man"" and the girl's life will be better without him.
