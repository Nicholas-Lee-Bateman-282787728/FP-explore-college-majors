8646732,1,B00IZ11WAS,"Mr. Karr (Brad Potts) tells the story of the re-generator to a reporter at a restaurant. The scene highlights the problems low budget productions have in filming indoors, mainly sound, awkward close-ups, and bad writing. The Re-generator (Olivier Gruner) is a military killing machine that can re-generate itself in twenty seconds. When a plane carry him crashes in Juniper Point, Colorado he becomes a killing machine on the local teen campers.

This film is part sci-fi, part slasher with neither one being good. The killings are not graphic. The plot was boring and the characters dull due to terrible trite dialogue and sad acting.

Not worth viewing.
