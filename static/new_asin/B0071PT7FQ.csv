Since she has almost every Disney movie ever made, I had to dive deep into the vault.  I remembered her mentioning this movie from her childhood.  Never heard of it, but enjoyed it just the same.",1361404800,,287,4.377358490566038
5048995,5,B0071PT7FQ,"I'm so thrilled to see this finally come out on DVD.  I've waited for this to come out for years, and I was so happy to get it.  A clean movie to enjoy with my family.",1358899200,,167,3.611111111111111
5048996,5,B0071PT7FQ,"I had enjoyed this movie tremendously as a kid in the 80s. Imagine my surprise when I saw it was available from Amazon. A classic Disney movie of the 80s, indeed.",1355529600,,162,4.258064516129032
5048997,5,B0071PT7FQ,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was a bit concerned this wouldn't be good quality or the right movie and was afraid it might be a pirated version or something since I couldn't find it anywhere else or advertised by Disney. I inquired about this movie on one of Disney's facebook pages and was directed here so I sucked it up and spent the money. (Wasn't too crazy to spend so much on a TV movie from the 80's but given the sentiment...) The quality of the movie it's self is pretty good given it's an 80's TV movie. I would have expected some special features given the price though. This is the movie only; it doesn't even include the prelude that would have accompanied it when it aired on TV. It does have closed captioning however, which these types of releases often forgo. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Unlike many kids movies today that make ""adult themed"" jokes, this movie has humor and punchlines you wouldn't be embarrassed to hear your kids repeat. One of my favorites was, ""Thank goodness it wasn't a million dollar moose that got lost."" Hope this helps anyone interested in owning this classic. A few other titles from this collection have caught my eye with which I'm unfamiliar and now that I know the Generations Collection is indeed Disney and not some video pirate out to make a buck I might purchase them when finances permit.  Wish they offered these as part of the Disney Rewards Program... just sayin'... in case anyone's listening (hint, hint) :)",1350172800,6,1499,4.531365313653136
