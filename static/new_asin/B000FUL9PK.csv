8126823,4,B000FUL9PK,"1st I'd like to clarify...2 teams, bike and pro-truck, Baja 1000. (not 500). Cool movie. Pastrana is an amazing individual. Well put together film. Great idea.",1385769600,,159,5.153846153846154
8126824,3,B000FUL9PK,"Travis Pastrana's unsinkable energy is the best part of this film. Otherwise, the filming & editing is second-rate at best. This wasn't actually a Baja 1000, it's a Baja 500 that they ran two vehicles in (one truck, one bike). I'm actually involved in off-road desert racing, and I know some of the guys in this film, and I still wasn't very impressed.",1193788800,3,352,4.603174603174603
8126825,5,B000FUL9PK,"Not only has he had a successful MX career, a freestyle career marked by the first and so far only double backflip, he is now also a rally champion (think subaru WRX on dirt), and in this DVD he decides after watching Dust to Glory that he wants to try and race in the Baja 1000 in both a truck AND on a bike.  So in about a month or two's time, he assembles a team and bikes, gets a truck ready, and they enter the race!  I won't spoil it for anyone, but this guy is just amazing.  Not only that but he seems incredibly easy going and a guy that would be fun to be around.  If you liked Dust to Glory (and who wouldn't), then you owe it to yourself to have this DVD as a companion.",1174262400,8,682,3.85
8126826,4,B000FUL9PK,This is a soild movie and good action. I would suggest it to anyone who likes riding and or racing.,1173657600,3,99,4.0
