3097711,1,B0012RCNEQ,"I've watched similar documentaries about herding and migrant people, so I thought I'd like this, but the way they handle the animals was very disturbing to me. Although their motto is ""the sheep must live"" they toss them around like they are not living creatures, and the ox and donkeys are literally pushed off of cliffs with their loads to make them keep going. Even the horseback riding was very cruel with reins held very,very, short with the horses heads jerked back and in obvious distress. I live on a farm and work with animals, and this was all very disturbing even with my mind kept open, trying to absorb other cultures. I could not bear to keep watching after the first 10-15 minutes! Sorry.",1362787200,,703,4.632

8247527,2,B0012RCNEQ,"This is a poorly executed conversion from whatever medium they used to dvd. The video and audio when Susha is singing are not synced properly, and there is a white vertical line through the image through most of the video. I returned the first copy I purchased, hoping that I just got a bad copy, but the replacement was no better. It is an incredible story and deserves better treatment than this schlocky work!!!!",1519948800,,415,4.621621621621622
8247528,5,B0012RCNEQ,"Since this film was made in 1976 before the Shah was deposed,  and there were already worries about the tribe staying together and keeping their sense of identity, it is difficult to ponder what may have become of them following the revolution. It is a well-done documentary about a beautiful people of whose fate the outside world knows little at present.",1501977600,,356,4.836065573770492

8247533,1,B0012RCNEQ,"The translator has heavy accent, and hard to understand
The people in this movie lose human life, very crude to animals & move 200 miles over mountains, just because of weather....!
its like Scandinavian move to Sinai desert in the winter..........!!
They are crazy and this is a bad message to send out as a movie",1391990400,,314,4.625
8247534,5,B0012RCNEQ,"Despite the old video format, this movie gives you a little bit of history into this age-old journey so worth the time.

Could be more enjoyable had it detailed the lives of the family but it appears to focus on just the head of the one 'tribe'

All in all, well worth the time.",1371686400,,278,4.12962962962963
8247535,5,B0012RCNEQ,A very interesting Shah era documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe in the spring across the Zagros Mountains. Its a bit simple and perhaps not overly dramatic but if its  a subject matter you find interesting you will enjoy. Some visually stunning shots of the villagers and the Karun river. All in english.,1368230400,,320,4.818181818181818
8247536,4,B0012RCNEQ,"This documentary really helped me out with a school project I'm doing on the Zagros Mountains. There are many interesting facts I learned about the Bakhtiari tribe's seasonal 200 mile migration through the mountain range. This movie helped me appreciate the staggering differences between the modern life I live and the life of the Bakhtiari. The terrain they must cross is beautiful and yet extremely harsh at times.

  I agree that the treatment of the animals is disturbing by today's standards. However, keep in mind that this treatment is not rooted in cruelty, but in the desperation of the tribe to cross the mountains before they run out of supplies or are caught by bad weather. The animals are extremely important because they are the sources of meat and clothing for the tribe. These people are not heartless. If an animal or tribe member is injured, they will be carried and nursed back to health. While watching this documentary, you will find that the Bakhtiari are an incredibly hardy tribe.",1365552000,9,1006,4.905882352941177
