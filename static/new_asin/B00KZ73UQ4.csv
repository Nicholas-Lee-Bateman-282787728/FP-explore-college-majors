6454676,2,B00KZ73UQ4,The singing was very good.  I think Anna was the best Leonora I have heard in a long time.  But the staging of this beautiful opera was a disaster.  What were they thinking!!!!!,1414886400,,177,4.303030303030303
6454677,5,B00KZ73UQ4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this performance. The negative reviews concerned me, so naturally, I was pleasantly surprised. As a fan of traditional productions, I kinda liked this non-traditional one. The singing and music are the most important part of opera and this production, although quirky, did not detract from those two important elements. I've seen more traditional productions that had moments that definitely interfered with the music and singing. Nothing in this production was that distracting, or offensive. Sadly, both productions to which I'm referring, feature Hvorostovsky. He thankfully wasn't part of the offensive portions of those productions but it's still a shame because they could have been perfect productions without the unnecessary distractions that did not promote the story, or the music, or opera, or Verdi. But I digress. As far as the singing goes for this production, Anna Netrebko sounds wonderful as Leonora. She certainly has developed lovely pianissimo and diminuendo. Placido does a fine job in the baritone role. And our Azucena was wonderful. The tenor was good even though I'm not a fan of such harsh vibrato. That's just my taste because he was excellent. The conducting was fine. Overall, it was a wonderful DVD that I will go back to watching again, and again.",1414022400,3,1299,5.25
6454678,5,B00KZ73UQ4,"Five stars above all for Barenboim's conducting and Netrebko's superb singing and acting; but also for the glorious staging and the very apt stage design (I much rather have a cardboard box than cardboard castles and trees! Indeed, to conjure up life inside a box is what dramatic art is all about). Domingo as Conte di Luna and Prudenskaya as Azucena are also outstanding. Reviewers complain of Rivero's Manrico, whose ""Di quella pira"" aria is certainly not commensurate to, say, Domingo's when he sang the role; however, Rivero has a beautiful voice, which enables him to sing other passages with a rare delicacy.",1413676800,4,615,4.980582524271845
6454679,1,B00KZ73UQ4,"This well-sung opera is visually painful, a poorly done version of Comedia' del Arte that is neither funny or even vaguely amusing. The silly costumes and ridiculous gesturing detract from some glorious singing by both Netrebko and Prudenskaya. Much better to buy the vocal tract without the DVD.",1413590400,5,296,5.1875
6454680,1,B00KZ73UQ4,"Don't waste your money this is the most horrible and ridiculous Trovatore ever. I would like to rate it with zero but it is not posible.

The only that saves this performance to be a complete disaster are Netrebko, who sings great, and Prudenskaya with her dark mezzo voice and great volume, sings a really great Azucena. The best singer of this Trovatore for me, in spite her costume and make up thar are really horrible and makes her look like a crazy ""something"" because is indescribable what the costume desingner tried to do with her .

The tenor, unknown, sings correctly but has an ugly voice that is not adecuate for the role of Manrico.

The lowest is Placido Domingo. After a long long career is time for him to go home , teach or sing other roles and not throw away his career and prestige doing things like this. He is not de Luna at all, and not a baritone.

He sang this same role with Anna Netrebko at Zalzburg Festival and with the same awful performance as de Luna.",1412985600,10,982,4.3791208791208796
6454681,1,B00KZ73UQ4,"This is the most irreverent and disgraceful performance of a serious and beloved opera.. You can very well play this DVD with your TV set off. It pretends to be funny but it is not. Seeing Leonora rolling over the stage floor with the most ridiculous and ugly dress is too much. We did not expect to see Colombina as Asucena, but she has a great voice. The tenor is good enough and Pl&aacute;cido is Pl&aacute;cido and he sings beautifully but he is not Count di Luna. This misoginous production should be condemned by all women who watch it. All the women in the opera, main singers and chorus are clowns, beginning with Leonora who looks more like Olympia. Had it not been for her glorious voice, this DVD would hav ended up in the trash can.",1412208000,11,744,4.437956204379562
6454682,4,B00KZ73UQ4,"This strange production of Verdi's masterpiece is laughingly silly as far as production values go but has some of the most glorious singing I've ever heard in this work.

First, the ridiculous: The set is an open ended cube of stone walls.  Count di Luna and his troops are costumed in solid black  Restoration garb.  The women of the castle and the ""gypsies"" seem to have wandered in from a commedia dell'arte production.  The confined set also limits the scope of action and acting that can take place under these circumstances.  But enough of that...

The sublime:  First and foremost, NETRBKO !!!  She has really grown vocally lately, and absolutely nails this difficult Verdi role.  I can't wait to see her in the Met's  MacBeth.  Or for that matter in any Verdi role you could imagine, Amelia, Desdemona, Aida, Leonora(Forze), whatever -- bring it on.  This is a must-own recording for her performance alone.  She is more than capably partnered by two of her colleagues, both of whom were unknown to me before.  Rivero is an ardent, beautifully-voiced Manrico and Prudenskaya is stunning as the demented Azucena.  The problematic casting is Domingo as DiLuna.  His tenor voice may be dark in color but it's not a baritone, and this performance is the weak link in this production.  That said, Domingo always gives an artistic performance and it's somewhat amazing that the great tenor at this point in his career would even attempt this role.  It's not what you want in an interpretation of DiLuna, but it's not boring.

Anyone who is a fan of Netrebko  and has a high tolerance for wackiness should enjoy this production.",1412121600,33,1628,4.826086956521739
6454683,3,B00KZ73UQ4,"Nice to listen to but I  couldn't watch it as horrible makeup, stage setup.blah.",1423958400,,80,4.714285714285714
6454684,4,B00KZ73UQ4,"It wasn't by chance that the Marx Brothers chose Verdi's Il Trovatore as the backdrop for their madcap 1935 movie ""A Night at the Opera."" Seen from an objective viewpoint, the behavior of Trovatore's four principals is sheer lunacy. Although Verdi urged his librettist to emphasize the story's ""novel and bizarre"" elements, so-called traditional productions often downplay its outlandish traits and thereby lessen their impact. An ideal staging would let audiences see the characters in a way that reveals their overcharged emotions and irrational actions but also conveys the musical excellence of what might be the most operatic of all operas.

The Staatskapelle Berlin's December 2013 performance, conducted by Daniel Barenboim with Anna Netrebko and Placido Domingo, approaches that dual achievement.

From Adrian Smpetrean's opening ""All'erta,"" directed not to the chorus of soldiers but to the audience, it's clear we're in for no ordinary Trovatore. This Ferrando and chorus are dressed in costumes straight out of the 17th century paintings of Velzquez and move with stylized deliberation. To detail the fantastical features of Philipp Stlzl's entire production would be tedious, besides spoiling the adventure. In addition to other reviews posted here (the ones that actually apply to the Berlin Trovatore), you can do a Google search for ""Il Trovatore, Opera News, March 2014, A. J. Goldmann"" and ""Philipp Stlzl's Il Trovatore has successful Wiener Festwochen test-run on bachtrack June 6, 2013"" for informed opinions. For myself, I'll say if you're capable of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's willing suspension of disbelief, you will see Trovatore as you've never seen it before -- not just on the surface, but through the outward appearance into the maelstrom of emotions that drives the characters. And you will hear a wealth of fabulous singing.

I bought this after watching Netrebko in the 2014 Live from the Met broadcast of Verdi's Macbeth at a local movie theater, and even after that experience, her performance in Trovatore floored me. I would never have expected her voice to mature into the force required to deliver such a Leonora. But it has and she does. Netrebko alone makes this worth seeing and hearing. Hers, however, is not the only great voice here, nor is she the only singer who can act. Domingo, 72 when this was filmed, sings and executes the role of the appropriately named Count di Luna with a virility that belies his age. Belaboring the point would insult the man who has given the opera world so much and who excels yet again.

The big surprise for many viewers will be Marina Prudenskaya's tour de force as Azucena. Her voice packs every ounce of the requisite power (she's the mezzo in the Verdi Requiem&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giuseppe-Verdi-Messa-Da-Requiem-Blu-ray/dp/B00NRD39QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giuseppe Verdi: Messa Da Requiem [Blu-ray</a>] conducted by Mariss Jansons), and her presentation of the gypsy's role leaves nothing to be desired. Into such company ventures young Gaston Rivero, a last-minute replacement for Latvian tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko. Given Domingo's history in the role of Manrico, it must have been intimidating for Rivero to fight a duel on stage with him, but the kid does good. If Rivero lacks the physical stature and stage presence of the other three, he can nevertheless sing the part.

It doesn't matter to me that no anvils are on stage at the gypsies' camp, but two of Stlzl's decisions are questionable. Instead of ordering Manrico's execution at the end, the Count kills him with his own hands. More bothersome is having Leonora stab herself instead of taking poison, and Netrebko spends a large part of Act IV with a bloody stain on her dress. Perhaps Stlzl thought the visual impact was needed. I wonder whether most viewers will agree. But the singing still reigns.

If I'd attended this performance, I'd feel I'd been blessed with the occasion of a lifetime. At considerably less cost, the Blu-ray is a bargain. I don't think it should be anybody's first or only Trovatore. But the video catalog is not overflowing with high-grade productions of Verdi's masterpiece, and the exceptional musical quality and insightful production features of this one lift it above run-of-the mill versions. I've watched the Berlin Trovatore front-to-back three times, and it holds up well. Whether it will do so a fourth time -- or how high it might rank in five years -- well, trying to predict that would be lunacy.",1422662400,12,4541,5.256551724137931
6454685,1,B00KZ73UQ4,"Whoever thinks this is a great version of Il Trovatore is someone who (1) doesn't really know anything about opera or (2) fans of the principle singers that they will overlook everything else no matter how bad it is! Also if you love Verdi baritones then don't bother, because Domingo is NOT A BARITONE!! Just because he started his career off as one doesn't mean he can do it now! He doesn't sound like a baritone at all, he just sounds like himself. Verdi surely is rolling in his grave at this one!!",1422576000,2,502,4.408602150537634

8662806,4,B00KZ73UQ4,"I heard Il Trovatore so many times I cannot even count. I thought that this version of Il Trovatore is bazar when I saw some parts of this first time. The costumes, make up, staging, the way singers move  everything looked so ridiculous. But after I watched the full opea on YouTube, I changed my mind.
Wow! What's a beautiful singing!!! The Azucena's role is a Verdi's tribute to his beloved mother to who he was very close.
Marina Prudenskaya (Azucena) nailed it. Duets Marico and Azushena are marvelous, so loving!!! Domingo did OK considering his age. But unfortunately his days of great singing are over :( He was out of his breath for the most parts. Especially in famous ""Il balen del suo sorriso"". Overall it's a very good performance. If DVD was avilable for all regions (not only US and Canada), I'd purchase it in a heartbeat.

8662812,5,B00KZ73UQ4,"This version of ""Il Trovatore"" reminds me of a puppet theater. The entire opera takes place in an open sided box sitting caddy cornered on the stage with the front corner of this box extending over the orchestra pit. In addition the box is sloped toward the pit to give the illusion of space. I feared for Anna Netrebko's safety when, at one point, she had to roll herself toward the front edge of the box. What a trooper she is. And what a skilful singer and actress. I bought this DVD because I enjoy Netrebko's performances but hers was not the only performance I enjoyed immensely. Anna Lepovskaja as the bored and long suffering Ines was delicious and Marina Prudenskaja as Azucena delightful. Placido Domingo at times seemed short of breath but I was happy to see him regardless. I thought that all the singers and the chorus were doing a wonderful job and I enjoyed this spoofy version of ""Il Trovatore"" immensely.",1428019200,5,921,4.621951219512195
8662813,3,B00KZ73UQ4,"I have no control over other product pages on which Amazon might run this review, but it is being written and posted on the page for DG's release of the 2013 Berlin TROVATORE. This stars Anna Netrebko (Leonora), Marina Prudenskaya (Azucena), Gaston Rivero (Manrico), Pl&aacute;cido Domingo (Il conte di Luna), and Adrian Smpretrean (Ferrando); Daniel Barenboim conducts; stage production is by Phillipp St&ouml;lzl.

St&ouml;lzl's approach to the most mocked and maligned of Verdi's mature-period successes seems to have been to concede that TROVATORE is, in fact, ludicrous as a dramatic property and to embrace silliness, double down on it. He has admitted to taking inspiration from ALICE IN WONDERLAND. The wisdom of the approach is questionable, but I have to review what is in front of me, and even at the level of an outrageous send-up (the Count's men put us on notice very early, ""voguing"" in synch with the rhythms of the baby-burning narration), I do not find this as good as it could have been. The set consists of two walls made up of many smaller cubes, and the walls are tilted to suggest an open quadrangle. The playing area is severely restricted. When the chorus has to swarm in, in II/2 and III/2, the stage picture is stiff and cramped. St&ouml;lzl attempts to mitigate the visual monotony of the set by incorporating video projections (by fettFilm) that range from primitive to risible. There are allusions in the projections to paintings of Magritte and Dali. Only St&ouml;lzl and God know why we get a projection of Manrico in ""Mal reggendo"" running at us in slow-motion like Lee Majors in the SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN title sequence. Ursula Kudrna's generally impressive costumes span and mingle eras. The men are in a Renaissance-wear, but the Count's men sport top hats; blond-wigged Leonora looks like Olympia the doll; Azucena is a painted commedia dell'arte figure, her bright red hair standing on end. Leonora stabs herself during the ""Miserere"" rather than drinking poison -- so she dies very slowly of a fatal stab wound, over two scenes, and both the Count and Manrico manage to overlook the conspicuous evidence left by the blood packet. The Count himself dispatches Manrico at the end, also by stab wound (Manrico dies instantly), so Azucena is left to ask where her ""son"" is when he is a few inches to her left. Two scenes feature a dancing bear.

The outr&eacute; context into which St&ouml;lzl places the action seems to rule out emotion, to dare us to take the opera seriously at all. But the singers cannot stop being opera singers, and so they do what they can to put emotion back in. This tension gives the production whatever interest it has. However, at 145 minutes (reasonably musically complete, but with only one verse each of Manrico's ""Di quella pira"" and Leonora's ""Tu vedrai""), this push/pull may feel like a long sit. Netrebko is in easier voice here at the smallish Staatsoper im Schiller than she ever is at the 3800-seat Met. As ever, intonation is not without mishap, and she must break the line at times by snatching breaths. But in general she is on top of the music, rather than (as in her lesser work) drowsily lagging behind it. She achieves amplitude without strain or great tonal compromise, she manages fioritura with passable agility, and she has a generous temperament -- the role is one of her happier recent assignments. Better still is Prudenskaya's young-sounding, lustrous and evenly produced Azucena, which one would like to encounter again in a more sensible production (note I did not say ""traditional""; any kind of ""sensible"" would do). Of the men, Smpretrean as Ferrando scores most highly, a fine sound and a compelling storyteller. Domingo knows exactly how his music *should* go, but even limiting discussion to his baritone assignments of recent years, the Count is not one of his most successful assumptions. He frequently sounds short of breath and underpowered, at the limits of what he can still do or slightly beyond them. Rivero was in the tough spot of replacing Aleksandrs Antonenko late, and his small-scale, bleaty tenorizing and cautious, eyes-on-maestro deportment make the title character of the opera recede to a near-afterthought. A third Slavic woman in the cast, Anna Lapkovskaya, registers strongly as Ines.

Daniel Barenboim has an excellent orchestra and chorus to carry out his aims, but it would be a great understatement to say this music is not his strong suit, even as Italian opera goes. He actively hampers the singers at times, as when he plows through ""Stride la vampa,"" never letting the ending of a phrase settle and sink in before moving on to the next, straitjacking Prudenskaya and limiting her expression. If he has any feel at all for the tinta of TROVATORE, for ways to help the singers by projecting mood and atmosphere in Verdi's marvelous score, he does not convey this to me. This is a square, heavy-footed, and unsympathetic reading, at its best when it can work at the level of virtuoso raw power (e.g., the massed forces at the end of III/1). One can forget about the masterly leadership of Carlo Maria Giulini (DG) or Riccardo Muti (Sony), and even one of the Italian journeymen on the Met's present roster would have been an improvement. What Barenboim brings to this opera begins and ends with his name and his impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;. He is a ""great musician,"" and so the music-making must be great. It is not.

To the best of my knowledge, this opera has never received anything like an ideal performance on DVD, certainly nothing on the level of the better audio recordings, two of which are named above (neither Giulini nor Muti had the best cast to record it, but they find things in the score most conductors did not even look for). Karajan's DVD (first on TDK, reissued by ArtHaus) has a dull and static in-period stage show directed by the maestro himself, and musical cuts that were already old-fashioned by 1978; but for letting us see and hear great singers supported by a conductor of equal stature, it is the pick of a lackluster lot. This new one is of interest for the strong performances of the two main women and the young bass.",1424563200,8,6178,4.869771863117871
