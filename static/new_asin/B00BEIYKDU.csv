5584422,4,B00BEIYKDU,"In the trailer you see the Sapphires being stopped by the VC, when they are traveling alone without military escorts.  They get out of the car, hands held up high, and Chris O'Dowd tells them to sing something.  That scene, which was obviously an important scene, was CUT from the movie.  In the movie, they are terrified to drive without a military escort, they leave the base, and the next thing you know they have arrived at the next base.  So all the tension of making the drive unescorted was for nothing.  We want to know what happened, what did they sing, and how did they evade capture?????  MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE CUT THAT PART OUT OF THE MOVIE!!!!  Very irritating, to say the least.
Otherwise, it was a terrific film.  But The Weinstein Company screwed up when they cut that scene!  I just hope it will be included in the DVD.",1366502400,2,837,4.4183006535947715
5584423,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Didn't get the DVD -  just saw it last night at the theater.  4 sisters from an Aboriginal family must overcome racism to fulfill their musical dreams.  They start singing country ballads to their grimly hostile neighbors and then hook up with a small-time promoter with dreams as big as their own.  In an often-stormy partnership, they craft a new sound: goodbye country, hello Detroit City.  Next up is a breakthrough tour performing for US soldiers in Vietnam.  Despite new musical success and romantic adventures, they are distracted by racial identity issues and family conflicts.  Furthermore, although the manager promised their father he would keep them away from wartime danger, things don't quite work out that way.  Despite these challenges, they reach higher goals - personal happiness and family reconciliation.  At the end, the film shows pictures of the real Sapphires and details on their post-music careers in the Australian civil service.",1366070400,,956,5.2368421052631575
5584424,4,B00BEIYKDU,"""The Sapphires"" (2012 release from Australia; 98 min.) brings the story, loosely based on a true story, of how four Aboriginal young women, Gail, Julie, Cynthia and Kay, are discovered at a local talent show by Dave, an Irish no-name has-been, who then gets the girls an audition to play for US troops in Vietnam in 1968. The girls do well at the audition, and off they go to Vietnam, where they play audiences, small and large.

As the movie opens, we are informed/reminded of the horrific treatment of Aboriginals in Australia in those days, including the so-called ""Stolen Generations"", where Aboriginals of pale skin color are taken away from their families. This is relevant to the movie plot, as it turns out that one of the four girls (played by Shari Sebbens as Kay) was indeed taken away at a young age. Nevertheless, after some initial turmoil, the girls get along great, and perform well. As they prepare for the Vietnam tour, their now-manager Dave (played by Chris ""Bridesmades"" O'Dowd) stops them in the rehearsals, imploring them to be ""blacker"" in their singing. The girls oblige, and success is only a matter of time.

Several comments: first and foremost, music is a big part of this movie, and it works like a charm, as we get treated to much late-60s music (the movie starts with a CCR song, and of course features plenty of Motown and Motown-reminding tunes). The first hour of the movie clips along just great, even if there is hardly ever a dramatic undertone or question how it will all turn out. However, the movie slows down a lot in the last half hour, even resorting to footage of Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination to move along the plot, if you can believe it. I was rather turned off by that, to be honest. That aside, the performances from the Aboriginal girls are ace. Bottom line: ""The Sapphires"" is a wonderful 'feel-good' movie, carried by the charms of Chris O'Dowd (who is clearly climbing the ranks of leading men rather quickly), but it falters towards the end. I saw this just recently in the theatre here in Cincinnati, and was surprised how poorly attended the screening was, given the positive vibes and reviews of the movie. Still worth checking out, though, whether in the theatre or on DVD.",1365984000,2,2241,4.714285714285714
5584425,4,B00BEIYKDU,"Remember 1968? LBJ is President, Vietnam is still a war zone, North Korea captures the USS Pueblo, and in Australia, it is still legal to remove light-skinned Aboriginal children from their homes, and place them in institutions to teach them the white man's ways. (A practice which was outlawed in 1969/70, this controversial issue is also addressed in both ""Australia"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence."")

We are in a remote outpost in Australia. Three girls perform for an itinerant talent scout, played by Chris O'Dowd (""Bridesmaids""). They sing a Merle Haggard song and he joins in on his electronic keyboard, adding some Floyd Kramer piano stylings. He offers them the chance to audition for a USO tour to Southeast Asia to entertain the troops. As soon as they arrive in the city, they look up a former playmate who had been captured and raised by whites.

After an initial culture gap during which the four of them must become re-acquainted AND learn Soul (their new manager knows their audience won't expect Country/Western from a girl group that looks like The Supremes), they are booked and head off for Vietnam.

Based on a popular play by Tony Briggs, whose mother was one of the original ""Sapphires,"" this satisfying sample of the sixties is great on many levels: O'Dowd is very good; each girl has her own distinct personality, issues, and career arc; while the clothes, news, and problems of the times are faithfully portrayed. I loved the big hair, the go-go boots and the Tupperware.

We see what a dangerous challenge a USO tour might become. It's fun to watch as our gals develop stage presence, refine their music and become at ease in the spotlight. In a very welcome postscript, we learn what each young woman achieved after mastering these important skills.

This film festival favorite is playing in art houses so you may not see it in your local multiplex; in that case, watch for the DVD. JayFlix.net participants will be notified when it is available. (NOTE: Closed Captions on my DVD from Amazon will be welcome!)",1365379200,18,2032,4.861271676300578

5584427,1,B00BEIYKDU,"This is up there with those other truly awful Australian films, Red Dog and Australia.
This is just not a true depiction of Australian culture, Aboriginal culture, the 60s or in fact the truth behind the real ""Sapphires"".
I was very disappointed in the ""sluttish"" behaviour of these girls, the over-reaching political correctness of the script,  and really found none of the characters likable.

For a great Australian classic, look no further than The Dish or The Castle.",1362441600,,472,5.038461538461538

It will remind you of the same discrimination that was present in the USA at the same time.

I have watched this movie many times because it is so uplifting. it makes my feet tap and I want to sing along.  I also learned so much about the plight of the First Australians and the ""Stolen Generation""..  Thanks to people like the young women that this film is about and so many others who worked for the rights of all people, we are blessed with performances from wonderful aboriginal actresses and actors like those in this film, now.  It is hard to believe that none of these girls had ever acted before.  Also, Chris O'Dowd brings his great comedic skills to this movie and keeps it light.  The story is true and was written by the son of one of the women that the film is about.  What a loving tribute from a son to his courageous and determined Mom and Aunts.

The music they are singing is really good. Most of them are R&B and they are well known.
Also there is Vietnam war involved which makes the movie more interested.
First, I had no idea how the movie will go.

It's not the story of an entertainer in a sapphire jacket, who has a female backup group.  It is a story of a girl band, Australian Aborigines, who are up against institutional racism in the 1960s and who are trying to develop themselves as a group of entertainers.  The man in the sapphire jacket is a broken down side man who sees them in a talent contest and recognizes their phenomenal potential.  He becomes their coach and guide.  It's a good story, and a fascinating and moving film with a love story.

Yeah--I was there and I couldn't believe how much of an industry it is. Huge. But this film just kinda assumes that you know that the Empire (a.k.a. U.S.) is going to have a whole industry devoted to entertaining the ""troops."" Well, I guess. I just wish they'd showed more about that, but I'm the kind of guy who prefers documentaries, I guess.

5585201,4,B00BEIYKDU,"Great film!
This DVD version must drop a star as  it is edited slightly differently from the original film released in the cinema.

There is one scene omitted (not found in the extras), which I thought perhaps the most gripping and memorable scene in the whole film. This occurs when the girls are traveling unescorted at night on a lonely road and are confronted by an armed Vietcong patrol. There is no common language between them to allow for any verbal communication.

For me, this was a critical high tension point in the original film. Without it, it misses something in continuity.

However, don't let this omission stop you from enjoying what is a refreshingly original film. The characters are likable and relatable despite their flaws and struggles. They're allowed to tell their story (based on real people, places, and events) through the medium of a musical comedy.

5585598,5,B00BEIYKDU,"The Sapphires, loosely based on true events in the 1960s, is about four young indigenous women  Gail (Deborah Mailman), Julie (Jessica Mauboy), Kay (Shari Sebbens) and Cynthia McCrae (Miranda Tapsell)  who set out on a musical career with a help from a male Irish manager Dave Lovelace (O'Dowd), who meets the singers at a local talent contest.  This charming little film has it all -- humor, suspense, struggle, and a story that is compelling. This will give the viewer a real feel for the prejudice experienced by Aborigine people, show how raw talent that is well directed can rise above all odds, and provide a different perspective on the war in Vietnam.  The real story is about racial prejudice in Australia. I know that there is prejudice in many countries, however I did not know that the ""whiter"" aboriginal children were taken from their families to be raised ""white."" This movie is well worth seeing.

I am joining the ranks of folks who are raving about this movie. It is excellent in every way. The script, the acting, the musical performances, the casting -- all stellar. The characters in this film feel real. I applaud the casting director for selecting actresses that look like our friends and family, and not magazine models.

What I like best about this film is that is depicts the complexities of race relations, including unfettered white racism of the worst kind and internalized colorism within communities of color. For those in the US who are unfamiliar with the racist history of Australia, the movies provides insight into the systematic mistreatment of Australian Aboriginal people by white Australians. With respect to gender, the lead female character remains autonomous, fierce, and strong throughout the film and is celebrated and rewarded for it. This is incredibly rare in films. With respect to sexuality, the female characters behave like sex-positive, empowered sexual agents. This movie contains no sexual objectification and no rape scenes. This only proves to Hollywood that a movie can be excellent without those tired, disgusting, sensationalistic, gratuitous, cheap scenes.
SPOILER ALRT

In 1968 Australia, Gail and Cynthia head into town for a talent contest and their young sister, Julie is forbidden to go because she has a child and is too young, until she bribes a fellow neighbour to take her into town. An alcoholic, Irish talent scout, Dave Lovelace, is scolded by his boss for being late despite him sleeping in his car that is near work. After the girls lose the talent contest, even with Julie coming in, Dave gives Gail her guitar back and as Dave is about to leave, Julie hands him a piece of paper, showing that the troops need singers for Vietnam. Soon, Dave goes to make a call and he says they have been accepted a spot to audition in Melbourne. Back at their place, Gail, Cynthia and Julie's mother tells him he can take them but Julie until Julie's father tells him not to worry about her. Advised by their grandmother, they meet up with their cousin Kay, who had been living in Melbourne for 10 years. She rejects the offer of joining them, but later changes her mind and meets up at their uncle's place. After days of training their moves, they are almost ready until Julie gives Cynthia a letter from her fiance that he is going to call it off. Despite that, they manage to audition very well and Kay comes up with the group's name, The Sapphires, after looking at Cynthia's engagement ring.

The Sapphires are a success with the crowds, but infighting among the women threatens to tear the group apart: Gail acts as the groups aggressive matriarch. Kay struggles with her multi-ethnic identity because 10 years earlier, she was stolen by the feds because her light skin made her a good candidate for assimilation into white culture, and Julie proves to be the group's best voice with a shot at a singing career. Dave and Gail begin a romance, but his reckless behavior and a personal secret push Gails patience to the limit.

When The Sapphires do another gig, Cynthia drinks with some of the men and is not allowed to go on again. Later, Dave and Gail talk a little before Dave hands her a letter, telling her to open it later and are about to kiss when they are soon caught in the crossfire of war and Dave disappears in the chaos and gets shot. At a home, Gail reads Dave's letter and realizes he wanted to propose to her, but it was her choice. The women band together and finish their tour. Dave survives and Gail is reunited with him in a Vietnam hospital. The Sapphires return to Australia and Gail and Dave announce to the family that they plan to marry. The Sapphires give a joyous performance for their friends and family in the yard of their home.",1431907200,,4725,4.7524390243902435
5585599,3,B00BEIYKDU,"Whats it about?

In the racist-fueled days of the late 60s, a quartet of young indigenous singers and their rambunctious Irish manager launch from the outback to Vietnam to entertain troops as Australias answer to The Supremes.

What did I think?

A feel-good Aussie musical with heart & soul. If the dialog and plot were less clunky in places, it would easily be a 4-star movie. Knowing its based on a true story makes the humor, romance, and tales of self-discovery more poignant, especially the fleeting references to racism, the stolen generation, and the horrors of war the group experience in Vietnam.

Sometimes when music is a large part of a story, they can rely on it too much, and the characters and story can lack some depth, but those four young women all held there own, and the existing racism at the time, and it's history was well treated.

They're discovered by Dave while singing, of all things, country and western in a small contest, but he explains that they must convert to soul music, the most popular at that time, if they want to perform for Vietnam troops.  Dave uses his self-proclaimed clout to get them an audition in Melbourne, but can they trust a man they've never met?  Can they trust each other?  Even with a bit too much kitsch, as well as the relationship between ""Gail"" (Mailman) and her cousin ""Kay"" (Sebbens) unnecessarily over-dramatized, the real centerpiece here is the appeasing 60's music, by way of ""The Sapphires,"" as a remedy for the concomitant detrimental effects of war and racism...and it's the music that triumphs!",1421452800,,1239,5.029268292682927

5585954,5,B00BEIYKDU,"I am joining the ranks of folks who are raving about this movie.  It is excellent in every way.  The script, the acting, the musical performances, the casting -- all stellar.  The characters in this film feel real.  I applaud the casting director for selecting actresses that look like our friends and family, and not magazine models.

What I like best about this film is that is depicts the complexities of race relations, including unfettered white racism of the worst kind and internalized colorism within communities of color.  For those in the US who are unfamiliar with the racist history of Australia, the movies provides insight into the systematic mistreatment of Australian Aboriginal people by white Australians.  With respect to gender, the lead female character remains autonomous, fierce, and strong throughout the film and is celebrated and rewarded for it.  This is incredibly rare in films.  With respect to sexuality, the female characters behave like sex-positive, empowered sexual agents.  This movie contains no sexual objectification and no rape scenes.  This only proves to Hollywood that a movie can be excellent without those tired, disgusting, sensationalistic, gratuitous, cheap scenes.

Given all that I have said, the cover of the film for US distribution reveals that promoters in the US are so wedded to racism and sexism that they misrepresent the essence of the film by featuring the white man on the cover.",1416787200,,1440,5.186147186147186

While mostly predictable, the film is heartwarming, the players do a fine job and the conclusion is sweetly satisfying.

I would have given it a higher rating, except the quality of the film and the streaming was awful. I had to restart it about a dozen times, which kept breaking up the story. The problem was not my internet connection, since it was working fine and fast for everything else.

5586213,4,B00BEIYKDU,"One strange thing about this charming Australian movie is that some DVD covers use misleading artwork, as if the film is about Chris O'Dowd as a singer, and four back-up singers in the background.

The truth is the other way around, as The Sapphires, loosely based on true events in the 1960s, is about four young indigenous women  Gail (Deborah Mailman), Julie (Jessica Mauboy), Kay (Shari Sebbens) and Cynthia McCrae (Miranda Tapsell)  who set out on a musical career with a help from a male Irish manager Dave Lovelace (O'Dowd), who meets the singers at a local talent contest.

Story-wise, The Sapphires looks pretty conventional, with romances, infightings and rousing soul music. Actually, the film attempts to touch on some important topics like Stolen Generations (covered more thoroughly in a 2002 Australian film Rabbit-Proof Fence), but director Wayne Blair is careful not to make the films tone too serious.

Perhaps after watching the film, you may want for more  more music scenes and more fleshed-out subplots. Even so, The Sapphires is an entertaining and uplifting musical drama.",1396569600,,1096,5.163841807909605

I don't want a bio pic featuring a major actor flashing their mind boggling abilities at impersonation. I don't need things to blow up or cars to be colliding at high speed. BUT I also don't want condescending pablum, sanitized for all audiences, that I wouldn't let my own children see for fear they get the wrong idea about life--the life I'm supposed to be preparing them for. Well, given all those negatives, this film is what's left. On the back it says: ""Inspired by a true story, THE SAPPHIRES is a celebration of music, family and self-discovery."" Hog wash. It is just--as if that were such a little thing--a simple story told well. Sometimes the right things happen. Sometimes you meet the right people and you do something amazing together that gives you plenty to reflect on the rest of your life.

The music ""took me back"" and the fact that it was based on a real-life situation, which also included some historical significance for both Aborigines and African Americans made it even more phenomenal. It's not a ""Once Were Warriors"" type of movie - which is one of my favorites; but more in the line of ""The Fringe Dwellers."" (though better).

It ain't right, mate, it's s***e.""  What makes The Sapphires outshine ""Dreamgirls"" is its freshness, its frank approach that reveals the soul of Australia's indigenous folk for the first time (to this viewers mind, in any case.).  The four gutsy young women become unlikely stars,  learn the Motown moves and songs as their new white manager plays accompaniment, touring Saigon to perform for American troops in war-torn Vietnam.  Based on a true story, one of the four actresses, Jessica Mauboy, went on to a singing career on her own as a result of making ""Sapphires.""  Director Wayne Blair's touch is fresh, the music isn't just laid on, but enlivens the whole film.  Just for its freshly-wrought sense of accomplishement, rough talking dialogue contrasted with the strong hearts of these four, you'll watch it more than once. Fav scene:  Lovelace talks to the four just prior to rehearsing about taking them to the Apollo, and he unobtrusively eases into ""I'll Take You There"" which the girls begin to sing, all the time, watching, feeling, singing, and so in to it.

They talk Dave into becoming their manager as they try out to entertain the American troops who are serving in Vietnam during the war.  Dave polishes their act as they move from country western music to soul.  The girls get picked for the Vietnam gig and off they go.  The sound track is fantastic with so many favorites of the 60's.

5586325,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Spirit and comedy coupled with a killer soundtrack make this movie a delight to watch.  The movie based on true events follows the  fortunes of an all aboriginal girl group that toured Vietnam in 1968.  The film touches on Australian's racism and forced removal of children from reserves that still permeated Australia at that time. However, it couples that with the bonds of family and openness that the reserves created in their daily living.  The reality of war is always in the background but this movie focuses on the people, from the harmony these four girls create, to their inevitable differences in their views of life.
  This is a movie that unfortunately received very little play in the US.  It is a quality movie that shouldn't have been buried in favor of ever bigger explosion films that dominate most screens.

5586521,5,B00BEIYKDU,"""The Sapphires"" is a drama, musical, comedy genre film and a standout contribution to a growing list of quality Australian works.

Set in the late 1960s the narrative follows the McCrae sisters, and their cousin Cynthia McCrae, who all grew up on an Aboriginal settlement in rural Australia, with aspirations to be musicians.

The three sisters are discovered by a travelling Irish pub entertainer named Dave Lovelace (Chris O'Dowd), and he helps them towards their goal to perform for troops in Vietnam. Appreciating their talent Dave encourages them to shift from country and western to soul music, which they adapt to with natural skill and some guidance.

It is a movie which contains many layers, including: the Aboriginal Stolen Generation, Aboriginal Self-Determination, seeing the Vietnam War from the perspective of Australian entertainers, and the chance to seize a life less ordinary.

Dave is lovingly Irish with a fun personality, and always well-intended despite making some mistakes along the way.

The McCrae girls are well presented, specifically, Deborah Mailman (Gail McCrae) offers a strong screen presence; Jessica Mauboy (Julie McCrae) is stunning and vocally sensational; Shari Sebbens (Kay McCrae) is joyous, confident, and doesn't take a backward step; and Miranda Tapsell (Cynthia McCrae) conveys the confusion of displacement, and the at times uneasy reconnection to her true self with natural authenticity.

This is a film which celebrates the experiences of four amazing women, and a fun Irish lad.

5586626,3,B00BEIYKDU,"There are a lot of inspirational based on a true story movies out there that are designed to corral an audience and get them rooting for the protagonist and wiping away tears and cheering in the finale.  They are the bread and butter of movie studios everywhere, especially if you are named Harvey Weinstein.  Yes, he is all about big screen manipulation, and his early year release The Sapphires is no exception.  Released throughout the festival circuit last year, The Sapphires garnered a lot of buzz and picked up a few scattered awards and mentions before finally being released this year here in the states.

Has anyone else heard of this movie?

This film chronicles the journey four young Aboriginal girls take to sing for the troops during the Vietnam War in 1968.  These young girls are initially chastised by the locals in the area because of their race, but when a foreigner takes a fancy to their talent, they are soon the talk of the town.  Ushered overseas, the girls become The Sapphires, a sassy and talented group of soul sisters singing soul music to the troops who are risking their lives in combat.

The Sapphires tries to be more than that.

Discussing a very dark time in Australian history, the core of The Sapphires has to do with the racial rape of the land and the fact that young Aboriginal children who were lighter skinned were actually yanked from their homes and placed in white foster care, taught white ways and basically brainwashed to be white children.  Baz Luhrmanns maligned Australia flirted with the same history.  This film (nor Bazs film) really get into the heart of that story, for they are preoccupied telling a different one.  The Sapphires has a music group to sell us, and a manufactured love story to weave.  Thankfully, the two leads are endearing enough to hold our attention, despite the fact that the film itself delves into ridiculously formulaic territory and just kind of falls apart.  Underdog stories are great, and biopics are rewarding, but some films cant get out of the rutt created by the genre, and The Sapphires fits nicely in that rutt.

Its just forgettable.

That is a description that can be used quite a bit here.  The musical numbers are forgettable, despite having some great music to choose from.  Their voices just aren't special enough.  While each of the main four girls show glimpses of promise, by the middle of the film three of them have pretty much become forgettable props.  Jessica Mauboy starts the film with such ferocity, but by the third or fourth scene shes completely tossed aside and given little more to do other than lip-sync.  Oh, and before I forget, the lip-syncing in this film is so bad its distracting, especially when it is that evident that they aren't moving their mouths at the right time or in the right way.  Miranda Tapsell starts off making ugly faces (Octavia Spencer style) and then becomes a clich of heavy drinking and loose morals but we couldn't care less.  Shari Sebbens has some nice scenes, but she isn't the most competent actress and doesnt sell them all.

Deborah Mailman is the star of the females here, and she could etch out a nice career for herself if shes given the chance.  Truly though, this film belongs to Chris ODowd, who is a genuine TREASURE here.  Hes is natural, charming, utterly hilarious, forward, believable and honest.  His character is also the most compelling, which could also be labeled a detractor since we have a film about the triumph of minorities and yet the most interesting character (and the best performance by a GIANT margin) is the white guy.

But Im not one of those people, so I won't complain about it.

When the film ending my only thought was I want to see more Chris ODowd movies and so I will, but sadly I didn't think anything about these four women, their struggles or the horrible lost years that are described on the films outset as if it were something they were really going to discuss.

Oh, and Don Battee is GOD AWFUL in this movie.",1386201600,2,4001,4.682403433476395

5586630,4,B00BEIYKDU,"From Australia comes ""The Sapphires,"" a charming true-life tale of four young Aborigine women who form a singing group in the late 1960s, then travel to war-torn Vietnam to entertain the troops. Gail, Julie, Kay and Cynthia are the girls (three are sisters and one, Kay, is their cousin) and Dave is the cut-rate impresario who becomes the girls' manager when he is the first to recognize the group's commercial potential. First, though, he's got to get them to stop performing that blasted country-and-western ""s***e"" that, for some reason, they seem to be so fond of, and to start belting out the blues.

Though it doesn't shy away from depicting the very real issues of racism and segregation that were so much a part of those times - Aborigines, after all, were not even officially declared humans in Australia till 1967 - ""The Sapphires"" is the furthest thing from a social commentary screed. It is, instead, a mostly light-hearted, joyous celebration of youth, talent, ambition and the power of music to blast through all social and cultural barriers (they don't call it the ""universal language"" for nothing).

The screenplay by Keith Thompson and Tony Briggs nicely differentiates each of the girls, allowing them to have their own quirks and personality traits, and doesn't just treat them as a homogeneous group. Gail, the oldest of the singers, in particular, is quick to get her back up when she feels her position as lead singer is being threatened or her talent challenged, but she is also willing to be a team player when personal sacrifice is what's needed for the good of the group. But as Dave states at one point, the abrasive and often obnoxious Gail is simply the ""mother bear"" protecting her sister cubs.

But all is not sweetness-and-light, as the girls cope with long-simmering tensions over race, personal identity and internecine relationships, as well as the dangers and tragedies that are an inevitable part of life in a war time setting.

There are splendid performances by Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens and Miranda Tapsell as the girls and Chris O'Dowd as their manager, and the singing is a wonder to behold.

Skillfully and unobtrusively directed by Wayne Blair, ""The Sapphires"" is a ""feel-good"" movie in the best sense of that term.",1385856000,,2281,4.945169712793733

5586735,4,B00BEIYKDU,"""The Sapphires"" is an Australian film about an Aboriginal girl singing group who traveled to Vietnam in 1968 to entertain the American troops. Gail (Deborah Mailman), younger sister Julie (Jessica Mauboy) and their cousin Cynthia (Miranda Tapsell), three Aboriginal young women from the Cummeragunja Reserve who have been singing together since childhood, enter a talent contest in a nearby town. In spite of clearly being the most talented, they receive a cold reception on account being Aboriginal. Only the event's alcoholic emcee, Dave Lovelace (Chris O'Dowd), appreciates their talent. He advises the ladies to give up country western music for soul. But the women also have a vision of their future. They ask Dave to get them an audition in Melbourne before the US Army, who is looking for singing groups to entertain American troops in Vietnam, and they may need to recruit their estranged cousin Kay (Shari Sebbens) to join the effort as well.

When I saw ""inspired by a true story"" flit across the screen at the beginning of  this movie, I took it with a grain of salt. But it turns out that one of the film's writers, Tony Briggs, is the son of a woman who was part of an Aboriginal girl group that traveled to Vietnam and Thailand to entertain troops with soul music and sex appeal during the Vietnam War. He was inspired by his mother's youthful adventures and modeled the character of Julie after her. Though much of the film is fiction, the premise of a group of young Aboriginal women finding opportunity in singing soul for American troops abroad, when there were limited opportunities for them at home in Australia, is true. This is a ""feel-good"" movie, and some turns of events are improbable. But ""The Sapphires"" is charming, the cast is appealing and not over-glamorized, and the film avoids being saccharine by creating believable conflict among the principle characters, revolving around racial identity and politics.

The DVD (Weinstein/Anchor Bay 2013): There are three bonus featurettes. ""The Making of The Sapphires"" (10 min) interviews the producers, writers, some cast, some creative crew, and director Wayne Blair about their opinion of the film and about the costumes. This is mostly presented as fragments of interviews strung together in an annoying way, as if no person interviewed is allowed to present a complete thought. ""Interview with the Original Sapphires"" (6 min) is a brief interview by Tony Briggs with the four women who inspired this story. I wish this had been a little longer. ""The Music of The Sapphires with Jessica Mauboy"" interviews Mauboy about singing the film's soundtrack, as she played the group's lead singer Julie. Dubbing for the film is available in French. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.",1384560000,,2769,5.028322440087146
5586736,4,B00BEIYKDU,"Now and then, that one movie comes along that just hits you the right way. It's fun, clever and strike all (or most) of the right notes. You're glad you tuned in and it stays with you.

Here's the scoop. Four young ladies from Australia, who are mutts (part white, part Aborigine),  have been singing together since they were kids. They enter a talent contest at a local beer joint where they do a decent job with a C&W tune. They don't win due to the fact they aren't white, but the piano playing, booze drinking host sees their potential and wants to manage them. Things go crazy from there.

This fun flick is not unlike ""That Thing You Do."" The difference here is these gals are working from the ground up as opposed to capitalizing on a hit record. And they're firecrackers to boot. The promise of fame doesn't make them tow the line. They speak their minds to anyone they disagree with and they do so with razor sharp tongues. Then there's their manager David Lovelace (Chris O'Dowd). What a hoot. Here's a white boy from down under who has a love for soul music and gets the girls to drop the country and western thing and learn how to step it off like the Supremes. He knows his stuff and sports some clever patter when he needs to have the girls see his way on how things should go.

The first act is great. It's one great scene with a great tune followed by another great scene and tune. Things do get a bit clunky when they hit Viet Nam for their tour to entertain the troops. The tunes are still good but the story seems to lack the focus of the first act, and they needed a few more details to lend believability to the proceedings. Chris O'Dowd does a great job. The girls are a bit uneven but they do well enough to keep things moving.

This is a really good time. There's enough fun mixed with enough heart to endear it to most viewers. And you do get to feel what it must be like to be known as a non human to those who rule you. For a good time call....the Sapphires.",1384387200,,1985,4.226912928759894

5586843,5,B00BEIYKDU,"""What a man, what a man, what a man, what a mighty good man"" ... This movie is undeniably harmonious with its dynamite cast and blend of powerful music.  It teaches a harsh history lesson and supplies a necessary breakout punch of female ambition.  In a war torn 1968, the soul singing Sapphires took the stage ...

The story of this all-girl singing group, originally named ""The Cummeragunja Reserve Songbirds"", starts way back in their childhood.  They were brought up to be fighters while singing away their cruel and unfair sorrows.  Starting from a place of complete segregation onto the church missions or the Aboriginal reserves, they had little opportunity for flight.  These sisters and cousins get it all together to the tune of 'Yellow Bird' then discover their opportunity to fly away during a music contest in town.  They have always had the talent, although now need the person to take them there.  It is here where they meet Dave Lovelace (Chris O'Dowd - ""Pirate Radio"", ""Bridesmaids"") who immediately takes notice of their obvious talent.

Gail (Deborah Mailman), Julie (Jessica Mauboy), and Cynthia (Miranda Tapsell) add their cousin Kay (Shari Sebbens) and are off to perform for the troops in Vietnam along with their new manager, Dave.  What is immediately clear in comparison to other movies about singing groups (especially women's) is that this one has a certain gritty edge and a welcomed unpolished shine.  These women are real.  Realistic looking, sounding, inter-relational, and overall they are extremely endearing.  They overcome great hardship to find their soulful voice in history.  One that was personally amazing for me to discover.

Director Wayne Blair, along with writers Tony Briggs (son of real-life Julie) and Keith Thompson, brings a highly relatable story to life.  A standout and stand-up soundtrack, along with original music composed by Cezary Skubiszewski, deliver song after song that speak to your heart.  ""These Arms of Mine"", ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie-Honey Bunch) ""Hold On, I'm Coming"", ""What a Man"", and ""I'll Take You There"" are only a few of many that make this film - Move.

5587017,4,B00BEIYKDU,"This is based on a true story, but how much it may follow that story is unknown.  What is interesting is that the film-maker, the son of one of the aborigine singers who were part of the Sapphires, chose to cast actresses who were far more aboriginal in their appearance than the originals - cameo pictures of them appear at the end of the film.  Odd choice, to say the least.

The story, a group of girls who use their singing as a ticket out of poverty and a ghettoized life, has been done and this film breaks no molds in the way it tells the story.  It does well and engagingly, however, and the music is great.  It's a very nice way to spend an evening.",1380672000,,658,4.149606299212598

Knowing that O'Dowd has established his name, the film was about the girls and their ability to sing and transend musical genres and not the O'Dowd's charater to take advantage of their talent. Very good movie.",1380672000,,354,5.120689655172414

It may not be completely true to the Sapphires' story, but one of the women's son co-wrote the screenplay.  That makes it authentic enough for me.  We didn't want this movie to end, and I haven't said that about a movie in a long time. I would advise everyone to see Rabbit-Proof Fence before watching The Sapphires to understand more completely the shockingly racist policies of the Australian government, which prevailed into the 70s. With that movie ""under your belt,"" you'll fully appreciate the challenges these brave young women had to face and understand why they'd risk Vietnam to reach their goal.",1380412800,,688,4.973913043478261

We had the best time enjoying this film!  We laughed, (I) cried, the music was wonderful, the story was moving, the acting was fantastic.  This movie is so fresh and new--not at all like the cookie cutter stuff we keep seeing churned out of Hollywood.  You'll be so glad you watched it. Nothing really raunchy, vulgar or shocking--the film didn't need to resort to that because the story was strong and compelling, the characters were well developed, the acting was very good (so great to see new faces and not the same ""stars"" that are in every other movie).  Perfect movie for a date night at home or a large group of friends.  I highly recommend it.",1380240000,,793,4.472222222222222

5587125,4,B00BEIYKDU,"Set in 1967 Australia, 4 Aboriginal girls from a segregated rural area come together to create a mostly upbeat soulful drama.  Based on real events, 3 sisters perform at the local town's open mic night.  Dave Lovelace (Chris O'Dowd) a wandering musician from Melbourne is squiring the local hotel owner and hosts the regular event.  All of the acts are terrible but for the sisters (and one previously distant cousin of mixed race who joins later) who are terrific.  In spite of the fact that they sing songs by Hank Williams.

Dave agrees to help them get an audition for a paying gig for U. S. troops in Vietnam.  On one condition.  They must switch their music to American soul music.  He's a big fan and it will certainly be a big hit with the soldiers.  Director Wayne Blair has adapted a stage play by Tony Briggs (the son of one of the real life sisters) who also wrote the screenplay with Keith Thompson.  The girls played by Miranda Tapsell, Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy and Sherri Sebbins (the pale skinned cousin) know their way around a song, especially Mauboy who plays the youngest girl Julie, who is also a single parent.

There are enough scenes - some in flashback - to highlight the atrocities forced upon the native Aborigines to get the point across without beating you over the head.  We also see newsreels from America featuring the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King which transpired as the girls and Dave are in the middle of their musical tour of South Vietnam.  There are also some scary scenes when one of the American camps comes under attack.

Each of the ladies manages to have some brief, but never explicit, romantic affairs along the way.  That includes one between Dave and the oldest sister, Gail (Mailman) who initially butt heads.  In spite of the been-there-done-that story line and some dramatic interludes, the film is fun to watch.  Some terrific musical performances make up for any dramatic shortfalls.

This is an excellent Blu ray transfer from Anchor Bay.  The story of the film includes a wide range of lighting challenges.  There are indoor daytime scenes as well as more dimly lit night time scenes.  Same with the outdoor shots.  The colors and the detail remain excellent throughout.  The film comes with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and is in 1080p resolutions.  Contrast and black levels are also excellent.  The audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise very good.  Beginning with an outdoor rural setting we get a nice sense of ambient sound.  The musical number are well placed if not overly aggressive.  Dialog is clear and easily understood.  Surrounds go into action primarily with some of the scenes in Vietnam including several involving helicopters.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a 10 minute ""making of"" piece and an interview (too short) with the original Sapphires by Tony Briggs.  Jessica Mauboy also has a short segment on the music for the film.",1380153600,,2960,4.811507936507937

5587127,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Those who have watched this with us had no idea about this movie.  Everyone, including none musicals, loved this movie.  And, when we found out that it was based on a book by the son of one of the characters, it sent this to the top.  This is great for those of us who remember the 1960 in US, but sheds some light on the Australian social history as well.",1379980800,,356,4.057142857142857
5587128,5,B00BEIYKDU,Really great writing!  Great story!  Great music!  Bittersweet moments and a nice ending.  Great family movie for ages 12 plus.,1379980800,,127,5.2
5587288,5,B00BEIYKDU,"To be sure, I ordered this movie based on the strength of Chris O'Dowd's mugging face on the dvd cover, so the marketing ploy worked. However, he has merely a secondary, albeit important part, so for the first part of the movie I was confused.

Taking place in 1967 and 1968, it tells the story of 4 Aboriginal girls who dream of a bigger life than the outback has to offer. A chance ad seeking entertainers for American soldiers in Vietnam sets them on their adventure.

The film uses actual news footage to help move the story along.  It's a big story which includes the racism and ethnic cleansing inflicted upon the Aborigine people, the Vietnam War, the personal lives of and relationships among the 4 girls and it's set to some of the greatest songs ever written.

Even though putting Chris O'Dowd on the cover made me buy the movie, it is very misleading as the movie is not a knee-slapping comedy. Yes, Chris O'Dowd is great in the film; he does offer some of the film's lighter moments and as usual, he brings a sweetness to the piece. However,  this is the TRUE story of four young Aboriginal ladies who struck out from their home to experience the world, while reminding us, the viewers, of the intense racism and hatred they were subjected to in their home country of Australia.

That being said, this movie is so much more than a treatise of bigotry.  It does have joy and great music,and it tells a wonderful story of coming of age, of love for one's home, family and friends. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that real pictures of the characters are shown as well bringing the viewer up-to-date as to what they did with their lives.

I loved this movie!",1379808000,,1676,4.472131147540984

In 1971 I was with the Navy Seabees and received orders to go to Vietnam and after 6-months I was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in Australia for R&R.  I could relate to every aspect of the movie.  I flew to a small town called Parkes and I stayed in a room above a pub that looked almost exactly like the pub the girls auditioned in the movie.  The music was spot-on and I just loved the girls - bravo I give them a standing ovation.  Chris O'Dowd - what a fantastic job.  No kidding I have seen the movie 5 times now and I can't wait to see it again.  My dream is to someday meet the cast - what a thrill that would be.  I've been back to Vietnam 6 times since the war and I help out in orphanages and try to help kids that need medical attention.

The great Soul hits of the 60's and 70's play an important role in this story based on true events. The singers chosen for the lead roles are exceptional talents as actors, and as singers, and they deliver a stunning performance! The plot and story line are equally as strong tracing their lives from their roots as children in the Australian outback to their fame as singers/entertainers on the stage during the Vietnam war.

Based on the true story of four Aborigine girls who sang together and were discovered and brought to a much larger public by a hard-drinking, hard-living, R&B loving Irish musician, for an initial tour in wartime Vietnam, the film is filled with good music, fine acting, and a story to touch the heart. And make it sing. And break a little. Award-winning actress Deborah Mailman leads the group governed by the oh-so-fine Chris O'Dowd. You may know him from the brilliant British series, ""The IT Crowd"", or his guest shot in ""Doc Martin"", or his hilarious
lawman in the very strange ""Bridesmaids"". But, here, it was Ireland to Australia and a Best Actor win for O'Dowd, and thoroughly deserved. ""The Sapphires"" is not just a musical. It's a story from the heart---with music!  [...]",1379203200,,872,4.8133333333333335

This is what the movie version of ""Dreamgirls"" should have been.

High-energy, pulse-pounding, storytelling. The girls are hot, the costumes are great and the story moves along quick.
Turn up the sound system on the music numbers. The music made my subwoofer BOOM. Some of the best songs of the 60's are here.

There's a bad boy who ends up finding his way, TWO very strong women (yay!), danger, heroism, love, and family.  There are several sex scenes but they are mild and fit with the story.  There's violence--it is Viet Nam but it fits in the story and isn't gruesome.  Chris O'Dowd's acting makes up for some stilted lines of the women, who are most natural in their strong lines (yay again!).  Most of the songs are very well done.  I highly recommend breaking out into dance each time the spirit moves you!  Plus it's based on a true story!

Sad to know Australia took their children away from families just as  the USA government too children from American Indians.  It's hard to believe both countries were so ignorant so  few years ago to take children away from parents because the 'government'  actually believed they knew better.  Such ignorance angers and amazes me.  It's hard for me to fathom.  Aboriginal people are among the oldest on the planet, the 'original' man with deep values and spiritually advance culture.

It had to be written and I am so glad it was. I am glad it was brought to film as well. Chris O'Dowd is spot on. Never over the top, just damn human, real and funny. Deborah Mailman is amazing and I hope to see her in many more feature films. It is obvious she has a true talent as an actress. Here's what didn't work for me; every time they sang it was NOT ""live"", as in on screen live. The perfect silence in the background of each song was irritating because it is obvious they were recorded in the studio. This took a lot away from the realism of the movie- especially since its a film about MUSIC. I wish the sound producers had gone the whole nine yards- it would have made a huge difference. I recommend it for the storyline, the acting, the guilty pleasure of watching an all girl group from the '60's do that all-girl-group-from-the-'60's thing so well.

5587824,4,B00BEIYKDU,"After initially reading the reviews that cited the Anchor Bay packaging of ""The Sapphires"" I was a little skeptical of the critics' sensitivity.  Having now seen the film I will concede they have a point.  Racist may be an extreme description but the distributors may have been a little misguided.  My sense is they were selling this as a vehicle for Chris O'Dowd who has made his screen presence known in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""This is 40"" but in my mind hasn't achieved star status just yet.  Some say his role is a supporting one but that is misleading because he is the lead male of the film and the winsome lasses playing the Sapphires are his co-stars.  It is a little food for thought when O'Dowd's face is front and center on the case with the Sapphires clearly in the background bathed in blue and white light to obscure their true complexion.  The film itself is above average.  It keeps to the age old formula of rags to riches with a few potholes along the way.  The Sapphires perform the standard Motown/Stax repertoire that are the stock in trade of films of this kind and do it with buoyancy.  I believe the actress who played Julie, Jessica Mauboy, was either a contestant or winner of ""Australian Idol"".  Truth be told I thought they were at their best singing the Merle Haggard song and I'm not a Country and Western fan.  I recommend this film because it sheds light on the plight of the Aborigines as it existed not so long ago and may exist to some degree today.  Primarily, though, I was floored by the performance of Deborah Mailman who played Gail the eldest of the Sapphires.  In a brassy turn Mailman possessed poise, brains, and beauty and felt that she held the screen terrifically.  If everything were fair and equal she deserves to be a star.",1376611200,,1768,4.5362776025236595

5587936,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Along with 'Red Dog' (2011), The Sapphires (2012) is one of the best 'feel good' movies to come out of Australia in years but the US version DVD/Blu-ray marketing team have made a mockery of what the movie is about (which includes racism themes) with a supposedly 'unintentional' racist/sexist' redesign of the Australian & International poster artwork to feature the 'white' supporting actor who plays the manager in bright full color prominently in the foreground, and the 4 Aboriginal girl group leads relegated to merely a Photoshop tint effect in the background, with careful 'brightening' of their dark skin (god forbid).
Anchor Bay Entertainment said in a statement that it ""regrets any unintentional upset"" caused by their DVD artwork redesign. 'Unintentional' being code for 'we don't take responsibility so don't sue us'.
If they had any morals, they'd write off a few bucks and change the artwork back to the original and pull the current stock off the shelves asap.
Would Anchor Bay have dared do this to a movie about The Rontettes or The Supremes.....no, didn't think so. Whilst Australia may not be as culturally litigious as the US (yet), parts of the US still seem to have a long, long way to go to stamp out racism in their day to day thinking and this is the kind of example that should be made an example of in the courts should Anchor Bay not do the 'right thing'.

I think the cover dismisses the girls as mere 'bit players' or 'backing singers' which is not the case at all.

The sexual encounters/romances of the girls while they were home and in Vietnam seemed to be there simply in an attempt to add some interest to the non-existent story. Chris O'Dowd is terribly miscast, and seems to be struggling to stay in character. Even the technical aspects (cinematography, makeup, artistic design, etc.) were amateurish at best.

5588110,4,B00BEIYKDU,"Remember 1968? LBJ is President, Vietnam is still a war zone, North Korea captures the USS Pueblo, and in Australia, it is still legal to remove light-skinned Aboriginal children from their homes, and place them in institutions to teach them the white man's ways. (A practice which was outlawed in 1969/70, this controversial issue is also addressed in both ""Australia"" and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence."")

We are in a remote outpost in Australia. Three girls perform for an itinerant talent scout, played by Chris O'Dowd (""Bridesmaids""). They sing a Merle Haggard song and he joins in on his electronic keyboard, adding some Floyd Kramer piano stylings. He offers them the chance to audition for a USO tour to Southeast Asia to entertain the troops. As soon as they arrive in the city, they look up a former playmate who had been captured and raised by whites.

After an initial culture gap during which the four of them must become re-acquainted AND learn Soul (their new manager knows their audience won't expect Country/Western from a girl group that looks like The Supremes), they are booked and head off for Vietnam.

Based on a popular play by Tony Briggs, whose mother was one of the original ""Sapphires,"" this satisfying sample of the sixties is great on many levels: O'Dowd is very good; each girl has her own distinct personality, issues, and career arc; while the clothes, news, and problems of the times are faithfully portrayed. I loved the big hair, the go-go boots and the Tupperware.

We get to see what a dangerous challenge a USO tour might become. It's fun to watch as our gals develop stage presence, refine their music and become at ease in the spotlight. In a very welcome postscript, we learn what each young woman achieved after mastering these important skills.

5588113,2,B00BEIYKDU,"This movie was a stunning disappointment and in so many ways a waste of a great true indigenous story.  And the reasons why are complex and of cultural significance (!), so are worthy of going into some detail about... so this is a LONG review.

Aside from some great music with a feel-good vibe, what I think I expected from this movie was some idea of what it was like to be aboriginal in Australia in the 1960's along with the twist of aspirations to play a part in the popular culture of the time.  I was also interested in an aboriginal perspective on the controversial Vietnam War where thousands of Australians fought and thousands more protested - two of the real-life Sapphires didn't go in protest.

Unfortunately, this film does not explore any of this in any real way - I got no understanding whatsoever of what life was actually like for these Aboriginal women, where their love of music came from, whether they wrote any songs or just did traditional or pop songs.  When we meet them, they exist in a movie vacuum, devoid of any real reality, indigenous or otherwise, and from there, things simply go from one formulaic movie situation to the next.

And worst of all, there is nothing even remotely Australian - or aboriginal - about this film except the accents and the window dressing.  No character, no story, no theme - nothing deeper - resides in this Hemisphere.

The two key problems with the film overall are its rough, amateurish quality (made more clear by its attempt to copy polished American ""feel good"" film formula) and its shallow, half-hearted attempts to depict issues of race and racism - which is at turns laughable and inaccurate, and occasionally rendered border-line offensive due to that stifling ""feel-good"" tone.  Despite newsreel footage in the opening and footage (such as MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech) throughout that suggests the film has more on its mind - it doesn't.

Up front, I'm going to put a big question out there.  Am I the only one offended by the idea that these Australian aboriginal women can only feel ""black"" by being taught soul music by a white man and having flings with African American men?  Amidst all the toe-tapping and feel-good-isms, it's a question that uneasily hangs over this film.  I found it bogus and a true waste of an indigenous story, mainly because there was no real-life white manager who gave them lessons in ""soul,"" and two of the four singers (whose characters are ""composites"" not based on any single real person anyway) never went to Vietnam, so most if not all fraternizing - black or otherwise - was fabricated for the film.  But wait... aren't these elements in and of themselves... racist?  Hmm...

Firstly, as many reviews mention, this film is pretty unsophisticated and roughly made - writing, direction, production value (sets, lighting) and even several of the performances only occasionally rise above the level of student film.  Scenes are awkwardly staged, the dialog is often cringeworthy and the story clunkily moves from one setpiece to the next.  There is a moment where the girls encounter some Viet Cong soldiers and someone I was watching this film with groaned and said ""they're not going to sing to the Viet Cong are they?""  You betcha!

The music - worthy of mention as it's the glue that sort of holds it all together and was a ARIA chart topping soundtrack from the musical play that started this project - is certainly strong in the abstract, but as experienced in the film itself, has that strange aspect where the singing is way-obviously recorded in a studio in stark contrast to singing supposedly happening in a scene.  This film also features one of the most forced, awkward and unlikely ""love stories"" I've seen in a long while - Deborah Mailman and Chris O'Dowd fall in love simply because... well, because the screenplay says they have to.  There is zero chemistry between them, zero incident that leads into it... it just comes from nowhere because the producers thought it would add a feel-good tag ending.  Oh, and that IS the feel-good tag ending!

Secondly, and more importantly, the film's ""exploration"" of race and racism is cringe-worthy in the way it is conceived and staged, and is often rendered laughable - I mean, we actually laughed in places.  Hamfisted parallels are made between the African American struggle for civil rights and the Australian aboriginal struggle - two stories that are so vastly different in the actual details they can only be united by a moron's vague concept of ""blackness.""  Get it?  They both have dark skin!  Yep, got it.

It's a conceit that is rendered even stranger by the fact that the Sapphires girls (all of mixed race) visually appear somewhere between Indonesian and fully white - and the fact that not a single face in this entire film is full blood aboriginal.  Yes, incredibly, in this aboriginal story - there are NO dark-skinned indigenous characters, even extras, in this film at all.  So when an American black man calls them ""black women"" upon meeting them in Vietnam, it plays as unlikely to say the least.  And when a dying white American soldier - laughably racist to literally his last dying breath - tells one of the Sapphires (who appears as black as Julia Gillard) and her African American boyfriend to get their hands off him, it plays as... well, unlikely.

And while African Americans were indeed disproportionately represented in U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, in this film they are shown as the majority.  I mean, like 90% majority.  African Americans pop up in this film in such numbers that it also starts to become laughable.  The girls show up at their Uncle's place in Melbourne and he's having a party... with dozens of black American servicemen?  Huh?  And the club the girls first arrive to in Vietnam... is 100% African American?  And every American serviceman the girls have any interaction with throughout the entire film - is African American?  And so is the American entertainment director, and the officer who auditions them, and... you see a theme emerging here?  They're black... are we getting this yet?  The scene where that Sapphires girl who appears 100% white (again, she doesn't just ""pass"" she gets a ""with honours"") tells her African American boyfriend that she is ""actually black"" is one of the biggest laugh-out-loud hoots in this movie.

With no dark-skinned aboriginal character ever onscreen, it's clear the movie is far more comfortable with the sexy, Motown-fuelled American concept of blackness than the boring Australian version.  And out the window goes any sense of freshness, uniqueness - and yes, Australian-ness.

It is worth pointing out that this film - partly funded by the Australian government via Screen Australia - also does not have single white Australian character who comes across as anything but blatantly, cartoonishly racist (oh - the white male lead is Irish and wants to be black.)  You know, the type who would applaud some lame kid with a ukulele singing an off-key song about cleaning, but coldly stare in silence when the new Supremes have just belted out a heart-stopping tune.  Yes, that's an actual scene in this film and the first big eye-roller.

And yep, we of course have the stolen generation scene, stolen shot-for-shot right from ""Rabbit Proof Fence,"" another of the ""Non-White Australia Policy"" films that seem to be proliferating as Australians clumsily seek penance for a deeply troubled past (just try sitting through another racist-white-Aussies musical train wreck, ""Bran New Dae"" from start to finish - I DOUBLE-DARE you.)

""The Sapphires"" and another recent Aussie film I watched this with, ""Mental"" (also featuring Deborah Mailman - as an aboriginal woman who seduces the underage daughter of a racist white woman - woohoo!) both include part of the cast of the recent American classic ""The Help"" - there is clearly growing demand for racist white female caricatures in 1960's outfits who love to talk tupperware and sneer at non-white people.  Think the cast of ""The Stepford Wives"" in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" suburban versions of the cast of ""Housos"" (oh, that's an Australian TV show also partly funded by the Australian government through SBS that humiliates uneducated, poverty-stricken white Australians.)  In googling it, Screen Australia's funding guidelines for films involving Indigenous content must pass stringent guidelines that ask questions such as: ""Does it empower Indigenous people?"" and ""Does it reinforce negative stereotypes?""  Clearly, if you're not non-white, all bets are off - and you deserve anything and everything even a pathetically untalented - but importantly, non-white - filmmaker can lob at you.

Interestingly, this film has joined other very recent Australian films in being major hits in their homeland and yet earning little to nothing overseas.  ""Red Dog,"" ""Tomorrow - When the War Began"" and now ""The Sapphires"" have proven that perhaps the Kool Aid tastes better down under and Australian film suffers for it - these films all share the same DNA of being inferior copies of American films of the same genres.

Little seen films - such as the Rolf De Heer's ""The King is Dead"" or ""Ten Canoes,"" ""Samson and Delilah"" (which did okay) or the older controversial ""Australian Rules"" are where it's at culturally, but as longtime custodians of the music of Abba and the film-making oeuvre of Julia Roberts, Australians must develop sophistication to go with their newfound wealth - and some level of sophistication to the racial penance that newfound wealth has inspired them to seek.

Until then, the cultural cringe - though inverted - is alive and well in crude, commercial crap like ""The Sapphires.""  And Australian Cinema will remain a situation of the haves and the have-nots - with empty cinemas playing great films and packed cinemas playing the proof that the golden age of commercial but cool, introspective and uniquely Australian film is as long gone as the 1970's.",1374883200,2,9982,4.936602870813397
5588114,5,B00BEIYKDU,"THE SAPPHIRES may be a bit rough, production-wise, yet it is a movie that is almost impossible not to like.

Inspired by a true story, the Australian-made film tells of four young Aboriginal women (sisters and cousins) who, in 1968, form a signing group, then travel to Vietnam, along with their white Irish R&B musician/manager, to entertain the troops.  As the girls journey through the war zone, they deal with long-standing family disputes, racism and also find romance.

Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens and Miranda Tapsell are irresistible as the singing quartet, while Chris O'Dowd is a delight as the down-on-his luck former ship cruise entertainment director, who becomes their manager.

Well directed on a relatively modest budget by Wayne Bair, THE SAPPHIRES moves along at a nice clip and is enhanced by many enjoyable music sequences, its humor and also some heart wrenching moments of war.

Incidentally, the movie's co-writer and associate producer, Tony Briggs, is the son of Laurel Robinson, a member of the real-life The Sapphires group.  Briggs also wrote the stage play from which the film was adapted, and in one of three featurettes on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, he interviews his mother and the other three members of the singing group.

Am I the only one offended by the idea that these Australian aboriginal women can only feel ""black"" by being taught soul music by a white man and having flings with African American men?  Amidst all the toe-tapping and feel-good-isms, it's a question that uneasily hangs over this film.  I found it bogus and a true waste of an indigenous story, mainly because there was no real-life white manager who gave them lessons in ""soul,"" and two of the four singers (whose characters are ""composites"" not based on any single real person anyway) never went to Vietnam, so most if not all fraternizing - black or otherwise - was fabricated for the film.  But wait... aren't these elements in and of themselves... racist?  Hmm...

Firstly, as many reviews mention, this film is pretty unsophisticated and roughly made - writing, direction, production value (sets, lighting) and even several of the performances only occasionally rise above the level of student film.  Scenes are awkwardly staged, the dialog is often cringeworthy and the story clunkily moves from one setpiece to the next.  There is a moment where the girls encounter some Viet Cong soldiers and someone I was watching this film with groaned and said ""they're not going to sing to the Viet Cong are they?""  You betcha!

The music - worthy of mention as it's the glue that sort of holds it all together and was a ARIA chart topping soundtrack from the musical play that started this project - is certainly strong in the abstract, but as experienced in the film itself, has that strange aspect where the singing is way-obviously recorded in a studio in stark contrast to singing supposedly happening in a scene.  This film also features one of the most forced, awkward and unlikely ""love stories"" I've seen in a long while - Deborah Mailman and Chris O'Dowd fall in love simply because... well, because the screenplay says they have to.  There is zero chemistry between them, zero incident that leads into it... it just comes from nowhere because the producers thought it would add a feel-good tag ending.  Oh, and that IS the feel-good tag ending!

Secondly, and more importantly, the film's ""exploration"" of race and racism is cringe-worthy in the way it is conceived and staged, and is often rendered laughable - I mean, we actually laughed in places.  Hamfisted parallels are made between the African American struggle for civil rights and the Australian aboriginal struggle - two stories that are so vastly different in the actual details they can only be united by a moron's vague concept of ""blackness.""  Get it?  They both have dark skin!  Yep, got it.

It's a conceit that is rendered even stranger by the fact that the Sapphires girls (all of mixed race) visually appear somewhere between Indonesian and fully white - and the fact that not a single face in this entire film is full blood aboriginal.  Yes, incredibly, in this aboriginal story - there are NO dark-skinned indigenous characters, even extras, in this film at all.  So when an American black man calls them ""black women"" upon meeting them in Vietnam, it plays as unlikely to say the least.  And when a dying white American soldier - laughably racist to literally his last dying breath - tells one of the Sapphires (who appears as black as Julia Gillard) and her African American boyfriend to get their hands off him, it plays as... well, unlikely.

And while African Americans were indeed disproportionately represented in U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, in this film they are shown as the majority.  I mean, like 90% majority.  African Americans pop up in this film in such numbers that it also starts to become laughable.  The girls show up at their Uncle's place in Melbourne and he's having a party... with dozens of black American servicemen?  Huh?  And the club the girls first arrive to in Vietnam... is 100% African American?  And every American serviceman the girls have any interaction with throughout the entire film - is African American?  And so is the American entertainment director, and the officer who auditions them, and... you see a theme emerging here?  They're black... are we getting this yet?  The scene where that Sapphires girl who appears 100% white (again, she doesn't just ""pass"" she gets a ""with honours"") tells her African American boyfriend that she is ""actually black"" is one of the biggest laugh-out-loud hoots in this movie.

With no dark-skinned aboriginal character ever onscreen, it's clear the movie is far more comfortable with the sexy, Motown-fuelled American concept of blackness than the boring Australian version.  And out the window goes any sense of freshness, uniqueness - and yes, Australian-ness.

It is worth pointing out that this film - partly funded by the Australian government via Screen Australia - also does not have single white Australian character who comes across as anything but blatantly, cartoonishly racist (oh - the white male lead is Irish and wants to be black.)  You know, the type who would applaud some lame kid with a ukulele singing an off-key song about cleaning, but coldly stare in silence when the new Supremes have just belted out a heart-stopping tune.  Yes, that's an actual scene in this film and the first big eye-roller.

And yep, we of course have the stolen generation scene, stolen shot-for-shot right from ""Rabbit Proof Fence,"" another of the ""Non-White Australia Policy"" films that seem to be proliferating as Australians clumsily seek penance for a deeply troubled past (just try sitting through another racist-white-Aussies musical train wreck, ""Bran New Dae"" from start to finish - I DOUBLE-DARE you.)

""The Sapphires"" and another recent Aussie film I watched this with, ""Mental"" (also featuring Deborah Mailman - as an aboriginal woman who seduces the underage daughter of a racist white woman - woohoo!) both include part of the cast of the recent American classic ""The Help"" - there is clearly growing demand for racist white female caricatures in 1960's outfits who love to talk tupperware and sneer at non-white people.  Think the cast of ""The Stepford Wives"" in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" suburban versions of the cast of ""Housos"" (oh, that's an Australian TV show also partly funded by the Australian government through SBS that humiliates uneducated, poverty-stricken white Australians.)  In googling it, Screen Australia's funding guidelines for films involving Indigenous content must pass stringent guidelines that ask questions such as: ""Does it empower Indigenous people?"" and ""Does it reinforce negative stereotypes?""  Clearly, if you're not non-white, all bets are off - and you deserve anything and everything even a pathetically untalented - but importantly, non-white - filmmaker can lob at you.

Interestingly, this film has joined other very recent Australian films in being major hits in their homeland and yet earning little to nothing overseas.  ""Red Dog,"" ""Tomorrow - When the War Began"" and now ""The Sapphires"" have proven that perhaps the Kool Aid tastes better down under and Australian film suffers for it - these films all share the same DNA of being inferior copies of American films of the same genres.

Little seen films - such as the Rolf De Heer's ""The King is Dead"" or ""Ten Canoes,"" ""Samson and Delilah"" (which did okay) or the older controversial ""Australian Rules"" are where it's at culturally, but as longtime custodians of the music of Abba and the film-making oeuvre of Julia Roberts, Australians must develop sophistication to go with their newfound wealth - and some level of sophistication to the racial penance that newfound wealth has inspired them to seek.

Until then, the cultural cringe - though inverted - is alive and well in crude, commercial crap like ""The Sapphires.""  And Australian Cinema will remain a situation of the haves and the have-nots - with empty cinemas playing great films and packed cinemas playing the proof that the golden age of commercial but cool, introspective and uniquely Australian film is as long gone as the 1970's.",1374796800,8,9982,4.936602870813397

What I will say is that, if you love American soul music and you hate racism of any kind, you'll like this film.  Inspired by a true story, three aboriginal sisters and a cousin set out on the journey of their lives accompanied by the aspiring group's white ""Soul Brother"" manager.  Their ""dream"" is to sing for the U.S. troops in Vietnam during the war.

5588197,5,B00BEIYKDU,"THE SAPPHIRES is a delightful, charming good time at the movies. It contains plenty of serious moments, but only enough to tug your heart-strings a little. It dabbles in lofty issues such as racism and war...but it really has its mind set on entertaining.

We meet a group of very talented aborigine women who have entered a local talent contest. They have modest goals and unusual choices for music. While their voices are lovely, the decision to sing American country-western doesn't quite jibe. Because these are women of color, they are pretty much pre-ordained NOT to win the contest...but lucky for them, the piano player is a charming drunk who sees more promise there. He convinces them to let him manager their act, convinces them to sing R&B, redubs them The Sapphires and actually books them a long-term gig...performing for the troops in Vietnam!

Off they go...their first trip out of the country and it's to war-torn Southeast Asia. Talk about your fish out of water story! Many adventures...some humorous, some romantic and some terrifying ...ensue, and a great time is had by the entire audience. The music is phenomenal and really the centerpiece of the film. It's all familiar, but these girls put their own spin on each piece. We get to see them mature as performers.

There are plenty of sub-plots...including some really interesting and moving material around the Australian government's policy of finding light-skinned aborigines and removing them from their families to be placed with white, usually urban and middle-class, families. One of The Sapphires fell into this category...and she comes into conflict with her friends. It made we want to go out and re-watch RABBIT PROOF FENCE, which was all about this terrible policy.

The music is the star, but close on its heels is the terrific cast. Chris O'Dowd (BRIDESMAIDS) is the only readily recognizable star, and he brings considerable hang-dog Irish charm to his role as the manager. Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens & Miranda Tapsell are all just delightful as the four Sapphires.

THE SAPPHIRES (based on a true story...watch through the end credits to see photos of the ""real"" women) won't change the world or win major awards. But it is a true crowd-pleaser in the best sense of the word. It takes us on an emotional journey, where we care about the outcome and have toe-tapping good time on the way.

5588198,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Aboriginal ""Dreamgirls"" go to Vietnam . Great musical performances and soundtrack
I missed the chance to see this film at last year's Philadelphia Film Festival but I heard good things about it and I'm glad that it's on home video.

If you've read my other DVD reviews on Amazon you know that I'm not a big fan of ""spoilers"" in reviews. It take the fun out of many movies.  That'll be the case here as well since there are moments in this film that you should discover for yourself. One comes just before the final credits and I won't reveal it here.

If I was to describe this film to someone, it would be something like"" The `Dreamgirls' ( but more Sister Sledge than the Supremes in style go to Vietnam"".  Yep, that's it. The Australian Film follows three aboriginal (black) sisters and their cousins as they embark on a singing career in the late 1960s by lanfing a gig playing US military bases in Vietnam. You can already guess some of the plot twists but, as I said, others sneak up. It's not a perfect film, by any means but there is sooooooo much music on the soundtrack - and performed by the actresses - that those performances alone make it worth seeing.  It's also cultural history lesson as I knew very little about modern day aboriginals before the watching the film and I learned a lot.

The 99-minutes goes by very quickly and the Blu-ray image and sound were great. Some of the scenes in Vietnam - filmed on location there - have a fogginess on the screen but that is intened (as you will learn in one of the three bonus features. The three are a nin-minute ""making of"" featurette with the producers, actors and creative crew, a 6 minute one interviewing the four women whose real life story the film was based on and a 6-minute featurette on the songs performed with commentary by actress Jessica Mauboy, who has an amazing voice.

If you liked ""Dreamgirls"" or love the soul music of the 60s and 70s I can certainly recommend this film. Probably only worth 4  stars but - for the music I'm giving it a FIVE.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5588199,2,B00BEIYKDU,"This movie was a stunning disappointment and in so many ways a waste of a great true indigenous story.  And the reasons why are complex and of cultural significance (!), so are worthy of going into some detail about... so this is a LONG review.

Aside from some great music with a feel-good vibe, what I think I expected from this movie was some idea of what it was like to be aboriginal in Australia in the 1960's along with the twist of aspirations to play a part in the popular culture of the time.  I was also interested in an aboriginal perspective on the controversial Vietnam War where thousands of Australians fought and thousands more protested - two of the real-life Sapphires didn't go in protest.

Unfortunately, this film does not explore any of this in any real way - I got no understanding whatsoever of what life was actually like for these Aboriginal women, where their love of music came from, whether they wrote any songs or just did traditional or pop songs.  When we meet them, they exist in a movie vacuum, devoid of any real reality, indigenous or otherwise, and from there, things simply go from one formulaic movie situation to the next.

And worst of all, there is nothing even remotely Australian - or aboriginal - about this film except the accents and the window dressing.  No character, no story, no theme - nothing deeper - resides in this Hemisphere.

The two key problems with the film overall are its rough, amateurish quality (made more clear by its attempt to copy polished American ""feel good"" film formula) and its shallow, half-hearted attempts to depict issues of race and racism - which is at turns laughable and inaccurate, and occasionally rendered border-line offensive due to that stifling ""feel-good"" tone.  Despite newsreel footage in the opening and footage (such as MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech) throughout that suggests the film has more on its mind - it doesn't.

Up front, I'm going to put a big question out there.

5588200,5,B00BEIYKDU,"This ""gem"" of a film is a treasure that's been buried under shallow box-office movies.

""The Sapphires"" is not a glitzy Hollywood romp romanticizing the late 1960s.  Neither is it a raw shock-value film of the Vietnam crisis.  What it is is a gritty story about the conflicts of race issues, betrayal, family conflict, and the loss of innocence.  And while the film doesn't shy away from the themes of exploitation, sexuality and confusion, it also doesn't saturate the screen with images to meant to overwhelm the viewer.

The based-on-life story of four sister/cousins (Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens, Miranda Tapsell) who boldly belly-up to the auditions for entertainers for the Vietnam Troops is inspiring.  The fights between the girls are fast, furious and leave you breathless.  The manager (Chris O'Dawd) pushes back with worthwhile pressure.  The family dynamics are complicated and real.

The story stays focussed on the issue of the girls and their struggles.  The effects are subtle and lend to the story, not overtaking the visuals.  The most refreshing part?  The actors are not glammed up; they are diamonds-in-the-rough and it's the rough that makes them great.  They don't look or sound like Barbie Commercials.

But wait!  What about the music?  If it's a film about a girl-band...

You won't be disappointed by the cast's ability to belt their pipes worthy of the big-screen.  There are 16 songs from the era, including (but not limited to) ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine,"" ""What A Man,"" ""Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch,"" ""Soul Man,"" ""Today I Started Loving You Again,"" and ""In the Sweet Bye and Bye.""

5588202,4,B00BEIYKDU,"The Sapphires, directed by Wayne Blair from a screenplay by Tony Briggs and Keith Thompson, is an engaging little Australian indie film based on a bit of real life history from the Vietnam War era.  In 1968, four Aboriginal girls from rural Australia, with the help of a down-and-out Irish talent scout, formed a singing group specializing in American soul music so they could get a gig touring Vietnam entertaining American troops.  The best comparison I can make film-wise is, if you crossed The Commitments with Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and then added a good dose of Good Morning, Vietnam, then The Sapphires is what you'd get.  And like those three films, The Sapphires has a lot of heart and charm that will really get you hooked.

The film begins in early 1968 in the Australian outback where three sisters - Gail (Deborah Mailman), Cynthia (Miranda Tapsell) and Julie (Jessica Mauboy) - live with the rest of their family in the Aboriginal settlement of Cammeragunja. The girls, all talented singers (with Julie, the youngest, the most talented), venture off to a talent contest in what passes for the nearest town, in spite of the open racism the white townies show them when they get up on stage. The contest is being managed by a down-on-his-luck Irish talent scout named Dave Lovelace (a great performance by Chris O'Dowd), who in spite of his general indifference regarding the gig notices that the girls are not only the best talent to show up for the affair, they're actually good enough to have a shot at making it professionally.

Their shot turns out to be an ad for an American company looking for musical acts to go on tour in Vietnam and entertain the troops. Dave offers to help manage them and prepare them for the necessary audition.  Gail is wary, the talent show being the furthest the girls have ever been from Cammeragunja, but Cynthia and especially Julie are hot for the chance.  Once Gail is persuaded and the girls decide to go for it, their first move is to look-up their cousin Kay (Shari Sebbens), a girl from their settlement whom they sang with as children but who became lost to them when she was taken away by Australian authorities because she was fair-skinned enough to be adopted by a white family. Kay is reluctant at first, not sure if she really wants to leave her comfortable white existence to reconnect with her Aboriginal roots, but when the moment comes she decides to go for it as well, reuniting the cousins and making the final group a quartet.

Dave starts molding the group, first by convincing them to drop the country & western songs they'd been doing and go for American soul songs instead, saying that rhythm & blues will give them their best shot at getting the Vietnam gig. In hilariously engaging scenes very reminiscent of The Commitments, Irish Dave starts familiarizing the Australian Aboriginal girls with American soul sounds and moves. But his most delicate - and difficult - task is to convince Gail, the oldest sister, that for the good of the group (and their chances for the gig), she has to let Julie, the youngest sister, be the lead singer. But in the end Dave's judgement proves sound because the girls get the gig. The finishing touch comes when they're asked what their group's name is and Kay, in a moment of sudden inspiration, abruptly changes their name from the tongue-tripping and hokey Cammeragunja Songbirds to The Sapphires, and then they're off to Vietnam.

The story is upbeat and feel-good for the most part, though it does show the kind of prejudice that Aboriginals had to deal with in Australia. It's one of the film's more subtle points that the girls find themselves more accepted by American troops in Vietnam than by their own countrymen, mirroring and yet contrasting the black experience in America with the black experience in Australia. In the opening narrative crawl, the film relates that until 1967, Aboriginals had no legal political or civil rights, not even officially being people since they were classified under flora and fauna. And how the government had a program to take Aboriginal children who were judged sufficiently fair-skinned away from their families to be given to white foster-families to be raised as whites.

But what really carries the film are the performances of the very talented cast.  Chris O'Dowd (best known for his role in the comedy Bridesmaids), puts a lot of heart and feeling into his role as Dave, bringing out his optimism and deep love of music as well as his all-too-human flaws. Deborah Mailman's Gail gives the film a lot of its center, being the oldest sister, used to being in charge, to being the responsible one, sometimes going against her better judgement but determined to look out for the others, even Kay with whom she has a problematic relationship. Miranda Tapsell's Cynthia is fun, her marvelously expressive face bringing out Cynthia's adventurous and unrestrained nature, while Jessia Mauboy's Julie is the most ambitious, and because of that, the most daring and determined of the three to try to make something of her talent. Shari Sebbens' Kay is the most quiet and tentative of the group, still feeling her way around and trying to figure out who she really is, which makes it all the more ironic that only by going to Vietnam and meeting a black American soldier does she come to accept herself on those terms. Tory Kittle's Robby, the black G.I. Kay finds herself romantically involved with, is engagingly rendered, easy-going and yet charmingly awkward, always moving the wrong way at the wrong time. And yet the most surprising - and yet believable - romantic development in the movie occurs between two of what one would have thought would be the least likely couple imaginable.  It's to the actors' credit that it all comes out gradually and that you can buy into it completely.

As a side note, the movie's co-writer and associate producer, Tony Briggs, is the son of Laurel Robinson, one of the real-life Sapphires portrayed in the film. A lot of the heart and feeling in the film comes from his close personal connection to the people involved.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story with unique characters carried by a highly talented and engaging cast, with a little insight into the world of the 1960's from an Aboriginal point of view.",1368576000,,6329,4.815837937384899
5588203,3,B00BEIYKDU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 'The Sapphires' is loosely based on the experiences of three Aboriginal women in Australia who performed Motown music for the US Army in Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. The film (based on a play, co-written by the son of the one of the women in the original group), features a fictional character, Dave Lovelace, who plays the group's manager, and arranges an audition for the three sisters, Gail, Julie and Cynthia, who hail from an Aboriginal reservation along with a fourth (estranged) sister, Kay, a light skinned black who was part of the infamous 'Stolen Generation' (light-skinned Aboriginal children forcefully removed from their homes by government agents and placed and raised in 'white' homes, prohibited from having any contact with their former family, who initially raised them).

'The Sapphires' is both a coming of age story where the sisters 'grow up' in the hostile environment of the Vietnam War as well as a tale of both exploration and reconciliation, where the ugly history of Australia's racist past is exposed and ultimately reconciled. Despite being forced to leave her family as a young child, Gail still blames sister Kay for rejecting the indigenous culture of her youth and no longer considering herself 'black'. When Kay finally returns and is back with her biological family at film's end, all the hurt from the initial breakup, is resolved.

The bulk of the 'drama' in 'The Sapphires' concerns how the sisters resolve their issues with men. Hard-headed Gail ends up with the unstable alcoholic Dave but when he's seemingly lost during the fog of war, there's a moment when all seems lost. Not to despair, in Grand Hollywood style, Dave is only injured and Gail and Dave later agree to marry during the denouement. Cynthia attempts to resolve her feelings about a former beau and Julie must face the wrath of the other sisters, when, as lead singer, a well-known singer wants to promote her as a solo act. If this all seems a bit like a soap opera, it is.

Nonetheless, the main thing 'The Sapphires' has going for it, is the wonderful Motown music, mainly sung by Jessica Mauboy, a former Australian Idol finalist, who plays Julia and backed up by the three other actors, playing the three sisters.

'The Sapphires' is a feel good film, definitely worth at least one look. The end credits chronicle the illustrious career paths the three women took after their days as singers ended. For what it is, this is an enjoyable, lightweight 'dramedy', which will satisfy 60s music aficionados, as well those interested in the history of Australian indigenous culture.",1367712000,2,2636,4.952488687782806
5588204,4,B00BEIYKDU,"THE SAPPHIRES is a delightful, charming good time at the movies.  It contains plenty of serious moments, but only enough to tug your heart-strings a little.  It dabbles in lofty issues such as racism and war...but it really has its mind set on entertaining.

We meet a group of very talented aborigine women who have entered a local talent contest.  They have modest goals and unusual choices for music.  While their voices are lovely, the decision to sing American country-western doesn't quite jibe.  Because these are women of color, they are pretty much pre-ordained NOT to win the contest...but lucky for them, the piano player is a charming drunk who sees more promise there.  He convinces them to let him manager their act, convinces them to sing R&B, redubs them The Sapphires and actually books them a long-term gig...performing for the troops in Vietnam!

Off they go...their first trip out of the country and it's to war-torn Southeast Asia.  Talk about your fish out of water story!  Many adventures...some humorous, some romantic and some terrifying ...ensue, and a great time is had by the entire audience.  The music is phenomenal and really the centerpiece of the film.  It's all familiar, but these girls put their own spin on each piece.  We get to see them mature as performers.

There are plenty of sub-plots...including some really interesting and moving material around the Australian government's policy of finding light-skinned aborigines and removing them from their families to be placed with white, usually urban and middle-class, families.  One of The Sapphires fell into this category...and she comes into conflict with her friends.  It made we want to go out and re-watch RABBIT PROOF FENCE, which was all about this terrible policy.

The music is the star, but close on its heels is the terrific cast.  Chris O'Dowd (BRIDESMAIDS) is the only readily recognizable star, and he brings considerable hang-dog Irish charm to his role as the manager.  Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens & Miranda Tapsell are all just delightful as the four Sapphires.

THE SAPPHIRES (based on a true story...watch through the end credits to see photos of the ""real"" women) won't change the world or win major awards.  But it is a true crowd-pleaser in the best sense of the word.  It takes us on an emotional journey, where we care about the outcome and have toe-tapping good time on the way.  It's one of the year's best surprises.",1367280000,6,2453,4.958333333333333
5588205,5,B00BEIYKDU,"Sure, it's a tearjerker and sure it manipulates you....but the fact that this story is inspired by true events and true persons makes it more than just a 4 hanky film. You can't help but come away from seeing this film without feeling uplifted and happy about how the world is gradually improving and civilization is being dragged kicking and screaming towards a higher state. See this film and tell me if I'm wrong!!!!",1367107200,4,419,4.675675675675675
5588206,5,B00BEIYKDU,"On the whole, this is an inspiring story and an enjoyable film. Four Aboriginal girls with a talent for singing turn into young women with talent that takes then out of the Australian outback to delivering soul revue to the American and other troops in Vietnam. It is definitely a feel good pitch, at times over sugared, but cannot take away from the achievement portrayed. However, the music pumps and delivers soul that is both true to its origin but sufficiently updated to engage with the musical tastes of today. The women in the lead roles are in a league of their own, sibling/cousin rivalry and sassiness that translates into their combined musical talent is a joy to watch and experience. Despite the neatly tied story lines and its at times predictability this is a universal story that works. The cinematography is tight and dies not get in the way of what is told. It is up there with ""The Commitments"" as a film that can inspire, is fun without being dumb and leaves you satisfied.",1366848000,2,994,4.653409090909091
