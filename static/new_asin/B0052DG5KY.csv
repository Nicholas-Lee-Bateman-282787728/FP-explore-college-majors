8453864,3,B0052DG5KY,"Pair of action / adventure films, one from the 70's, the other from the 60's.  I bought this DVD for the film The Killer Likes Candy, a 1968 Euro-made film starring Kerwin Mathews.  He plays a CIA spy type hired to protect a Middle-Eastern potentate.  Beyond that it doesn't make much sense except that the title refers to an assassin who has a sweet tooth.  The transfer is pretty good quality but it could use re-mastering which it will probably not get.  In quality it matches the RareFlix DVD, except that the RareFlix has an unpleasant trailer one has to sit through before one can see the film.  The Code Red DVD has some extras, including trailers.  If this is your preferred genre, either version will do.",1523750400,,713,4.566929133858268
8453865,4,B0052DG5KY,I'll buy any film that takes place in the Philippines which is where STONEY takes place and it;s a good little thriller. THE KILLER LIKES CANDY is just average.,1385856000,,160,4.551724137931035
8453866,3,B0052DG5KY,"[STONEY / THE KILLER LIKES CANDY - Widescreen and Fullscreen presentations] 'Stoney' stars the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet, who never looked lovlier and had as much screen time devoted to her considerable assets, but this is the sole reason to check this Code Red dud out. Not even the presence of Michael Rennie and Richard Jaeckel can add a noteworthy moment to this Phillipino fiasco - if it weren't for the early 70's fashions and nudity of its star, there'd be absolutely no reason to suffer through this stinker. But for her legion of fans, it's a must. She's radiant and bewitching in every scene. It's a mishmosh of espionage and double-crossing with several action scenes that temporarily elevate it from the trenches of tedium. The flick appears to be missing a few scenes and was edited incorrectly at several points, blowing any semblence of continuity, not that it really matters. So much for that.

The second flick, 'The Killer Likes Candy', is about a killer hired to take out a ruler of a ficticious country, and his weakness is his sweet tooth, leaving candy wrappers at the scenes of his crimes. Kerwin Matthews plays the CIA agent trying to catch him before his plan is complete. Marilu Tolo co-stars in this typically predictable and rather boring entry in a genre that had run its course a few years before this release.

Recommended for completists only (and fans of the luscious BB,'natch), all else should probably avoid, no matter how 'Stoney' or sweet-toothed you may be.",1322956800,6,1495,4.858823529411764
