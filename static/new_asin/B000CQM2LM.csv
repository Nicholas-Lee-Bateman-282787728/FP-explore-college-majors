you will be amazed the difference what some lighting can do for you.

Sound is clear, picture quality is good.

If you don't know what materials to get to understand flash photography. Get this 1st, books later.

2469049,5,B000CQM2LM,"I was very surprised with the information that was given in this DVD. The whole DVD is interesting and full of useful information that will make you re-think the way that you take pictures and the examples shown only help you to further understand how to use the speedlites to the max.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone that want to learn more creative ways to use the flash and for users that are just starting in flash photography.",1162857600,28,437,4.4625
2469050,5,B000CQM2LM,"Being new to the Canon Speedlite, I've spent several days on internet reading up on them and how best to utilize them. That coupled with the manual that came with my 580EX gave me a good idea of features etc., but what none of my research did for me was let me wrap my head around how it all came together in real world photography. This DVD in one short hour took care of that for me. It is beautifully balanced between explaining the basics of lighting for photography and then showing how to use Speedlites to accomlish this. I've already watched it several times and I plan on watching it a few more times after I've taken some more pictures.

If you're new to the Speedlite and confused a bit about all the features and how to put them to work, this is the DVD for you. Highly recommened.",1161302400,60,793,4.286666666666667
2469051,5,B000CQM2LM,"This gives good info on using your flash and more on manual.  To really achieve a great shot, get the Canon cable and 'remove' your flash from on the camera.  Just shooting on camera, you will get snapshot pics.  To utilize this info, get the cable and watch your shots change!  I hold both the camera and flash when I am not in the studio.  I get wonderful results that don't look like a snapshot.",1228089600,,398,4.253333333333333
2469052,1,B000CQM2LM,"I ordered one item and received a confirmation order in respect of that order. I next received a shipping email stating that the item had been shipped along with eight other same items. I am still waiting for my refund of 124.1p

2469053,5,B000CQM2LM,"The Canon 580ex II is an outstanding flash unit with many alternatives on how it can be used. The DvD, ""Understanding the Canon Speedlite 580ex/430ex"" is a very good instructional DVD that covers a terrific amount of information on how you can achieve the best results from the flash unit. It is one of those DVD's that you will watch multiple times and still learn something new each time.",1221436800,,390,4.666666666666667
2469054,5,B000CQM2LM,"A great companion to the canon speedlight instruction book. It does not over the 580 EX II specifically, but there is plenty of information to give you the basics and then some if you are learning the Canon speedlight system for the first time.",1216944000,,244,4.568181818181818
2469055,3,B000CQM2LM,"This video was moderately helpful to me. There seems to be a limited availability of instructional material out there on this product from what I was able to find so, some help is better than none.  The video does focus on portait style photography.  If you are interested in learning about how to shoot childrens parties, weddings or events, you will be disappointed in the very limited information on that subject. If you are interested in studio portraits and studio macro photography you will get some good information.  This video left me wanting more specific instruction on the operation and application of the 580ex outside the studio setting. Overall, if you are willing to pay $20 for a few good nuggets, it's worth it.",1214265600,,729,4.862903225806452
2469056,5,B000CQM2LM,This DVD is a good audio visual presentation to explain the settings and how to use the Canon 580EX flash unit effectively. Some people can better understand instructional material when presented as a audio/video presentation than to read a book. Tim Mantoani does a good job in presented basic inflormation about light quality first and then how to achieve the desired effects that go beyond the Canon manual and that makes the DVD worth viewing and owning. I would recommend this DVD to anyone struggling with how to effectively use the 580EX flash unit especially in the ETTL-II mode.  You can achieve results like professional photographers who make the flash work as they intended.,1211846400,,686,5.017543859649122
2469057,4,B000CQM2LM,"Very good content. Done in a studio, but applies to the outside world just the same. My only complaint is that it didn't play on my TV, just the computer, and I had to download a video codex pack to be able to do even that. I would like to relax in fromt of the TV to watch this at my leisure.
 Watch it a few times to sort of soak it all in. Lots of great tips, much better themn just reading about how to do sometning.",1204243200,,420,3.772727272727273
2469058,5,B000CQM2LM,"This is an absolute must-have for any owner of the 430ex or 580ex canon flash. It teaches you everything you need to know, in easy step by step examples. HIGHLY recomended!",1202860800,,172,4.580645161290323
2469059,4,B000CQM2LM,"The DVD covers the technical aspects of how to operate the speedlite.  It also explains how the flash units work and gives many good examples of how to use light when taking photos.  For me, a novice, I found it useful.  I give it 4 stars because it is a little pricy for only one hour of instruction.  It would have been nicer if it ran longer with more examples.",1198886400,,364,4.1571428571428575
2469060,5,B000CQM2LM,I have skimmed a couple of other texts on flash photography and bought a Nikon sponsored DVD 10+ years ago.  I think this DVD on the Canon flash units provides one of the best tutorials for the intermediate photographer exploring the more advanced features in sophisticated flash units like 580/430EX.  It also addressed my specific interest in the use of multiple flash units utilizing the master/slave settings.,1197763200,,413,5.149253731343284
2469061,5,B000CQM2LM,"This does exactly what it says, it goes beyond the manual that comes with the flash and helps you to understand more capabilities of this flash.",1197417600,,144,4.576923076923077
2469062,3,B000CQM2LM,"I found it helpful to a degree, but I wanted it for sports photography, and it didn't address this topic at all.  So, if you're using for portrait or anything but sports, this should be very helpful.",1195948800,,199,4.378378378378378
2469063,3,B000CQM2LM,"Ditto George's comments.  Although the host purports at the beginning of the video that, ""Wherever possible, we've kept this presentation simple and geared to the things you're most likely to shoot,"" I was very disappointed to discover that it concentrates almost exclusively on studio photography, along with a smattering of carefully staged outdoor photography with studio-type equipment.  If your focus is studio photography, this dvd will likely prove very helpful.  However, if you want to learn how to get the best out of your Speedlite 580EX or 430EX to shoot candids, travel photogrphy, or other real-life situations, do NOT buy this video.",1195776000,8,648,5.333333333333333
2469064,4,B000CQM2LM,"A well put together Video that explains how to use your 580 EX & 420 EX flash units. So easy to understand - even a caveman could do it.

Well worth the money!",1194998400,,159,3.8181818181818183
2469065,3,B000CQM2LM,"I've had my 580EXII for about 2 months now and have just been experimenting with it. I just picked up a 2nd 580EXII and figured it would be worth looking into this DVD for some clarification of the advanced modes as well as different types of effects I can get with my flash.

I found it to be good at explaining some functions and how the camera works - functions like rear curtain flash and why you're limited to a certain speed due to the first and second shutter curtains. A lot of the example images shown throughout also look fantastic and I would've loved to hear more about how to achieve those type of looks rather than what the DVD actually spent  a lot of time covering.

As someone said in another review, this DVD is mostly geared toward studio work. I take most of my photos outdoors but wanted to get a little more involved with studio-like work. This DVD seemed like it would be a good investment as it gives the impression that it will teach you how to achieve studio-like results with just the bare minimums (one Canon speedlite, possibly 2 (which is mentioned repeatedly throughout the disc)). I was excited after hearing this as I don't want to spend a great deal of money to setup a studio for product shots.

Unfortunately, a lot of the DVD focused on the same type of product shots (and kept flashing back to them). Ones that require a number of additional accessories (off camera cords, light boxes, reflector dishes as well as assistants and equipment to hold these)). Not exactly the type of equipment that a ""newbie"" would have lying around.

The video focuses almost entirely using the Digital Rebel cameras (mostly XT) so if you own one of these, it will be very easy to follow (I own the XTi and (as mentioned) the 580EXII). While the DVD was made using the previous models of each, it's still very easy and almost all points covered in the video match with the newer models.

My next complaint with the video is that some sections just get a brief 60 second explanation before rushing on to the next. One of the reasons I wanted to watch this video was for a better explanation (and maybe some ideas) of what I could use the ""Multi Stroboscopic"" effect for - this video just briefly covers what was in the manual and gives 1 poor example of what can be done.

Overall, I have mixed thoughts on the DVD. Some points covered seem to be helpful for ""newbies"" while others went over even my head. I like that it started out showing you how to achieve good results with the basics, but it quickly went on to feel like ""All you need is a camera and a flash... and then this, this, that, this and that"".

It did help explain some modes (such as FEL) but overall it's not something that I can justify the purchase of.

It's something worth watching once or twice before selling off. Borrow it if you can, but in the end, $20 isn't going to hurt you too bad compared to what some equipment will cost you!

Overall: 3.5",1194566400,14,2940,4.407749077490775
2469066,2,B000CQM2LM,"The DVD is informative, and easy to watch. However, I felt that it was not a great value for the price. It's very basic, and covers studio techniques more than anything. I was hoping for a more detailed explaination of the features of the Speedlite and why they work the way they do. Also, the video was shorter than I thought it would be.
Additionally, the last part of the video focuses on how to use multiple Speedlite setups in a studio. If someone owns that much lighting equipment, they are already aware of everything explained by this DVD and probably will gain nothing by watching it.
As a new user of the Canon Speedlite, I wish I'd have saved the money  and put it toward more lighting equipment instead.",1193011200,5,715,4.5
2469067,3,B000CQM2LM,"This DVD focuses almost entirely on studio photography: use of the 580EX with carefully positioned diffusers and reflectors and use of multiple Speedlights under master-slave control (even though I suspect most studio photographers use strobes, not compact Speedlights).

My shooting style is to take travel pictures and people candids. I wanted to learn how to use the 580EX mounted on my Canon EOS 5D camera to improve those types of pictures. On this subject the DVD is virtually silent. So if that's your objective, don't buy this DVD.",1192406400,109,539,5.125
2469068,4,B000CQM2LM,"Flash lighting is a complex subject which I'm sure is why so many flash photos come out looking as they do. Highlights blown away, backgrounds dark as a cave and not much in between.

Some of these problems are due to equipment, but more are directly related to  a poor understanding of how modern flash units work and what it takes to get the most out of them.

The Canon 580EX II and 430EX are marvels of technology and will enable you to produce studio quality images every time.

The manuals the come with these units are very detailed and will explain every button, switch, and function on the units. What they don't do is tell you when you use these features and what else you need to know to get to best results.

This one hour long CD fills this gap and more. If you follow along, take the time to do the exercises, and review your results you will see a startling improvement in your flash photography.

You will no longer look at these units as just bright lights, but a real creative tools.

The CD is not perfect. Some sections are passed over too quickly or not discussed at all. But for the most part you will get the information you need to make your investment in your Speedlight pay off for you

The 580EX II is not specifically covered as I guess it was too new at the time this CD was produced. But the basic information you will require to use it is there.",1186185600,23,1376,4.285714285714286
2469069,4,B000CQM2LM,"Understanding the Canon Speedlite 580EX/430EX is an excellent resource for photographers of any skill level, but particularly for beginning/novice photographers.  While geared mostly towards portrait photography, many of the concepts presented can be easily translated into other photography styles (nature, photojournalism, etc.).  The video does a good job of going through some basic theories of flash photography and does an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating the functions of the 580EX/430EX flashes.  At around an hour runtime, this video was designed to be watched multiple times as the photographer practices the concepts explained during the presentation.  While I enjoyed the video and will watch it again to reinforce the concepts I learned, the one knock against the video I have is that the author did not go more into use of the flash in a less-controlled environment (i.e., outside of the studio), which is how I use the camera a majority of the time.  Still, as I said before, this video is an excellent tool for understanding how to use the excellent Canon flashes.",1185753600,12,1093,5.258620689655173
2469070,5,B000CQM2LM,"Watching this DVD was time well spent.  In just over 1 hour, I understood more about lighting in general and using the Canon Speedlite 580EX or 480EX than I could have ever got from the manual or another book.  The production quality of the DVD is quite high and it has chapter marks so that one can easily rewatch any section desired.  It was worth every penny and more!",1184025600,6,371,4.3478260869565215
8100380,5,B000CQM2LM,I needed this since the last one I ordered elsewhere was for the 580EXII & was not comparable. It's very informative!,1425340800,,117,4.619047619047619
8100381,5,B000CQM2LM,"This is a really nicely presented video. This video helped me out a lot. Although my speedlite is actually a newer 430EXII and I had hoped this would cover that as well, it does not. But it was well presented and helped me a lot.",1363824000,,229,4.111111111111111
8100382,5,B000CQM2LM,"I am a person that love photos, nuances, shadows and colors.

I begin with this 20 years ago, and still a great hobby.

With the time I change my cameras and now have a good one.

I start usind speedlights just 3 weeks ago.

I learn so much with this DVD that now I take realy ""wow"" photos.

Go ahead and buy it.

8100383,4,B000CQM2LM,"I recommend this instructional DVD, but it is a bit advanced for the beginner.  Overall very good and in addition to learning how to use the settings on the Speedlite, there was also some great tips on lighting a subject (both in-studio and outdoors).  At times they breezed by some more complex things they assume you know, but I didn't.",1315612800,,338,4.616666666666666
8100384,5,B000CQM2LM,"I found this great for getting a basic understanding of the Canon Speedlites which you don't get from the manual. I also like that they went with the concept of one & two flashguns (especially good for amateurs like myself who purchase gear as they can afford it).
Demonstrations of various set ups and examples was good. All in all a worthwhile purchase.",1259798400,,355,4.650793650793651

8100386,4,B000CQM2LM,"The DVD is a little bland, but I guess so is the subject matter.  It teaches you how to use the 580 & 430 flashes",1236211200,,113,3.52
8100387,3,B000CQM2LM,"The DVD has a good introductory content, but it lacks more detail and different situations (most of the times it's about studio photography).

The DVD is 1 hour only, the folks at blue crane could have used the extra one hour to add more content.",1232841600,,246,4.466666666666667
8100388,4,B000CQM2LM,"I agree with several of the other reviews for this item, and add that after watching it I gained some very useful information but felt it could be drawn out more and slowed down.  I've been photographing for over twenty years on an intermediate, amateur basis but still found some of the information and logic hard to follow.  In other words I think this is pitched from a professional's viewpoint who isn't quite able to bring it down enough to an amateur's level.
There are good lessons to be learned here, and I think it was worth the purchase.  I would love to see a revised release sometime.",1232323200,2,596,4.5
8100389,5,B000CQM2LM,"Understanding the Canon Speedlite 580EX/430EX is an excellent DVD! It answered many questions that I had about lighting and flash photography. I have been in photography since the fifties and never had flash photography explained in such details.  The DVD addresses these topics in a studio environment so that you can immediately see the effects of changing in lighting. The same principles can be applied outside the studio. The DVD explains in great detail why you should get the flash unit off the Camera.  Even if you take candid shots on the fly, you can improve your shots, as the DVD illustrates, by using the Canon Off Camera Shoe Cord OC-E3.

Detailed operation of the Speedlite system, including wireless is also discussed and demonstrated. This DVD is well worth the money and should accompany ones purchase of a 580EX or 430EX unit.",1228867200,,845,4.936619718309859
