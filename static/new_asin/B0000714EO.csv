1798105,1,B0000714EO,......disjointed...disorganized...unoriginal...overacted...was this thing ever released in theaters?...they no doubt threw in a very brief nude scene of Elizabeth Hurley to try and make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film...Leary looked uncomfortable through the whole thing...what a waste of talent.,1043625600,5,310,6.232558139534884
1798106,2,B0000714EO,"I can't totally pan a film that features a nude scene from Liz Hurley (no matter how brief), but overall, this thing stinks. In no way does it measure up to anything DiCillo's done previous to this. I like all of the actors here, but they're given basically nothing to work with here, short of some really anemic Tarantinoisms. Avoid.",1042588800,6,334,4.583333333333333

1798174,3,B0000714EO,"This odd tale is all over the place. A mashup of comedy, crime drama, romantic comedy, cop show and satire, none done well. They don't really give the great cast a lot to do, Bushemi is really underutilized and Hurly has an odd part. There is some entertainment here if you settle in and go with it.",1436572800,,299,4.2631578947368425

1798176,4,B0000714EO,"This was a great, silly comedy that made us laugh out loud- not something I can say about many current flicks. Leary was very believable as the worn out old fashion cop. the screenwriter pair was HYSTERICAL, way too real in their stupidity.",1388880000,,240,4.604651162790698
1798197,4,B0000714EO,"Where are the sequels?  There should be ""Triple Whammy"" and ""Quadruple Whammy"" at the very least.  How about ""Whammy,"" the prequel?",1388880000,,131,5.190476190476191
1798198,3,B0000714EO,"Painful to watch the sad attempts at humour. The best acting was by Luiz Guzman playing a character role. Watching denis leary and
Elizabeth Hurley fornicating made me run to the bathroom and projectile vomit",1386979200,,208,4.9714285714285715
1798199,5,B0000714EO,"Take Denis Leary at his sacastic and funny best, throw in two retards in pimp suits, and the sexy, sexy Liz Hurley. Throw this mix into a surprisingly well crafted comedy and prepared to be surprised! A real sleeper.",1357430400,,216,4.564102564102564
1798200,3,B0000714EO,"Denis Leary plays Ray Pluto, a city detective whose life is in a downward spiral. He is still mourning the death of his wife and child from a car accident and his career is at a standstill. One day he and his partner, an odd sad-sack played by Steve Buscemi, pull into a fast food place for lunch. Despite complaining of a bad back Pluto goes in to get the food. While he's there a truck crashes through the window and a gunman jumps out and begins shooting. When Pluto goes to shoot him, his back goes out, he falls knocking himself unconscious and a ten year old boy picks up his gun and kills the shooter.

Dubbed a ""loser cop"" by the newspapers, Pluto's life goes further in the toilet. He begins a romance with a chiropractor played by Liz Hurley, and becomes embroiled in solving the attempted murder of the super of his building who is a friend. The plot also mixes in the two idiot would-be killers and two other building tenants who are writing a screenplay and try to use Ray's police knowledge to make it more realistic.

Double Whammy tries to be an action/thriller/comedy hybrid but never really achieves the right mix and ultimately fails at all three. The characters are too tepid to be really interesting and the comedy farce never materializes. There are conversations in the movie that just sit there and go nowhere, while in the hands of a skilled writer would have been laugh-out loud funny. Christopher Noth and Steve Buscemi are wasted in roles that barely have any screen time and end up meaningless to the plot. Double Whammy isn't a bad movie but it could have been much more.",1294099200,,1601,4.517241379310345
1798201,2,B0000714EO,"Well, this is the kind of film which many of us picked up out of the bargain bin not knowing anything but what appears in the blurb. No doubt some will find it funny, others will not. I did not, so I cannot point out just what it is the other group who like it w liked.  The lead actress is attractive, though her role mostly involves jumping the bones of the lead actor. She plays the role of a chiropractor, he is a detective with back problems. Of course, in this sort of film, no question of the fact that she is violating a basic premise of her profession, for which she could lose her license, never enters the discussion.  It is, she says, just that she is impulsive. Naturally, following what one is to believe is a highly satisfactory session of sex between them, he calls to tell her he doesn't want to see her anymore.  You get the idea.
I did notice this was supposedly based on a book by Hiassen;  no doubt he enjoyed the check he received. Without having read the book, I feel certain that the film bears little resemblance to it.
Glancing at some of the other reviews, I see that I have failed to give notice of the girl who plays the teenage daughter of the detectives landlord and friend. That was because I really did not notice her in the film (of course, I saw her,  but did not note her). Perhaps,  if one is of the age where she shines, one is of the age for which this film was made, and, therefore, one who will get much pleasure from it.",1257897600,,1462,4.185053380782918

1798203,2,B0000714EO,"Well the title kind of says it all. Dull,ugly,boring men in a dull,ugly boring movie. Also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world. Stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley with ugly, skinny, beaked nosed  Denis Leary. Steve Buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film.",1168992000,,302,5.04
1798204,3,B0000714EO,"Denis Leary(Judgment Night, Final) makes Pluto's character come to life with spazazz. Elizabeth Hurley(Bedazzled2000, The Weight Of Water) is a godess on screen as she does the chiropracter quite well and the little love scenes with her and Leary were nice but I wanted to see more of her. Donald Faison(Tv's Scrubs, Can't Hardly Wait) and that other guy, forgot his name, as they try to figure out the name of their movie and write it at the same time. They are hilarious. ""as a cop have you ever seen a guy being penetrated with throwing darts in the eyeball and chin?"". Luis Guzman(Punch-Drunk Love, Magnolia), Melonie Diaz, Chris Noth(Tv's Law and Order, Tv's Bad Apple), and Steve Buscemi(Resevoir Dogs, Ghost World) also star. It doesnt balance itself out a bit and some of the scenes are better left out then in but the outcome and the end is great. I also liked the bit on TV when they say the redheaded kid is writing, directing and starring in his own movie",1086048000,,967,4.627906976744186
1798205,5,B0000714EO,"This movie has a fantastic human element to it. I found it to be profound, yet keeping a true since of humor. A must have for DVD collectors looking for some depth and humor to their collection.",1078876800,4,194,4.27027027027027
1798237,5,B0000714EO,"great film, like a modern day film noir.  Also an extra addad bunus is the gorgeous Melonie Diaz, who prances around in her schoolgirl pleated miniskirt.  Great tough guy cop, who also has a romantic side.  Great mix of comedy, gore, and art.",1078876800,,242,4.5813953488372094
1798238,5,B0000714EO,"Check out that gorgeous little Melonie Diaz!!!  WOW, it's worth buying the film to watch her in her catholic schoolgirl miniskirt, pleated outfit.  The film itsekf is artistic, fun, comedic, and slightly gory in a funny way... Well worth purchasing for artsy fartsy people...",1078876800,,275,5.2272727272727275
1798239,5,B0000714EO,"This is an interesting film, with a lot of very artistic shots.  For instance one scene a killer falls down dead, and lands face to face with someone tied up on the floor, which makes for some eerie and yet comical artistic filmography.  And how about that Melonie Diaz, WOW!!! Melonie is one hot little babe, prancing around in her catholic schoolgirl pleated short skirt, owning the film is worth it, just to watch her, what eye candy, and what legs!!!  Anyhow the leading man is our comical hero, and this film is almost a comedy, a humorous look at crime.  A future classic, and should appeal to those who do not like commercial films, and like art, jazz, and the finer things in life...",1078876800,,691,4.504

I took the dvd home and watched it and lemme just say this film is hilarious. There are quite a few things goin on at once , but they go well together that build up to some funny parts. Even during some so called serious scenes i couldn't help but laugh.. i enjoyed this movie and would reccomend it to anybody, DIcallo is so original with this film it doesnt come close to feeling like any film i saw before, he truly added his own flair to it, definately up there as one of my favorite comedies",1078272000,,642,4.103174603174603

1798242,1,B0000714EO,"I recall reading an interview with director Tom Dicillo where he expressed frustration with Lions Gate's handling of this film. The film sat in limbo for quite a while only to be denied a theatrical release in the US.
After one actually watches this limp, half-baked mess of a film it's easy to understand why it went straight to video.
After high profile bombs like Bedazzled and Serving Sara, it looks like Liz Hurley isn't having any better of a time in the wonderful world of ""too hip to have anything resembling a plot"" Indie films.
Hopefully this means we won't be seeing her again any time soon.
Eventually Dicillo will stop pouting and get back to making films as enjoyable as Johnny Suede and Living In Oblivion.",1059264000,,721,4.640625
1798243,2,B0000714EO,"This movie does not know what it wants to be. A comedy? Love story? Crime drama? It has multiple storylines that we expect to somehow come together (and they do), but they are so different, it simply does not work. The beginning is very funny and entertaining, so you expect to be in for 90 minutes of great movie fun, but right there, the sad urban drama line kicks in and ruins the whole thing. In the end, the sad and the funny parts cancel each other out, bringing the whole experience to NEUTRAL. The only positives are charming Liz Hurley and the cuddly New York setting. But even that is not worth paying for in this case.",1057017600,3,629,4.338983050847458
1798244,5,B0000714EO,"This movie was awesome. It has so many plots that come together very well in the end. I couldn't stop watching the movie i have watched over 5 times in one day. I highly recomend it. It has the Guy From scrubs, Dennis Leary, Elizabeth Hurley, and my favorite actor Steve Buschemi.",1047859200,7,280,4.403846153846154
1798245,2,B0000714EO,"With Denis Leary and Steve Buscemi in this movie you would think this would be a non-stop laugh riot right? WRONG!. If you like jay leno/Johnny Carson kinda' jokes, then maybe. I thought this movie was very disorganize, very mild in humor, more of a drama/love story, and had about the same enjoyment as stepping on your kids toys in the middle of the night. Denis, please go back to stand up! (I love his ""no cure for cancer""!!!!!!)",1047340800,2,433,4.493670886075949
1798246,2,B0000714EO,"...to be oh-so-hip, so Tarantino-esque.  More of an attempt to project ""attitude"" or ""vibe"" than any real or spontaneous substance.  There are a few funny and satirical moments in there, but overall it has the amateurish feel of a made-for-TV movie.
Result: sad waste of some prime acting talent, especially Steve Buscemi adn Luis Guzman.  Dennis Leary has always been a mediocre actor with a very limited range, and he's in way over his head as the central character here.  Elizabeth Hurley is gorgeous to look at but also possesses a very limited acting range, and WHAT nude scene are the other reviewers talking about?  I didn't see anything more than the side of her breasts for about 2 seconds!  C'mon guys, you can get more revealing pics of her on the Internet for Chrissakes!  As much as I like her, it definitely WASN'T worth sitting through this one.",1043884800,9,860,4.731543624161074
7973559,4,B0000714EO,"This film is a little underrated. It has a strong cast, an entertaining weave of intersecting plot lines that are more or less resolved, and some decent comic relief. Still, it seems underdeveloped, not leaving as much of an impression at the end as I'd expect from the promise of the material.",1503187200,,294,4.673076923076923
7973560,3,B0000714EO,I watch movies a lot of times because someone I like is in them.  This was the case here.  I had never heard of this.  But Elizabeth Hurley was in it.  So that was enough for me.  The movie isn't bad.  Denis Leary plays a cop who becomes a hero through something everybody thinks he did.  That he really didn't  do. And things just kind of get more out of control from there.  This movie is good enough to watch over again every once in awhile.,1488153600,,444,4.069767441860465

7973566,4,B0000714EO,"Anything with Buchemi is worth watching, and although his role is secondary to Leary's in this film, he makes it worthwhile.
