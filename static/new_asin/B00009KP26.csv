1883453,3,B00009KP26,"I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1979 and remember liking it a lot.  A few years later, I think it had a debut TV broadcast on ABC, but since then, it has virtually DISAPPEARED!  No VHS, no DVD, not even an occassional broadcast on cable television.  Nothing!

It's a shame, because long before Michael Douglas's characters were banging the likes of Glenn Close, Sharon Stone and Demi Moore, he gave a rare and emotional performance as a divorced father trying to achieve his dream of Olympic-marathon glory.

Michael, please, if by chance you're a web browser, tell your fans what became of this movie!  And if not, please send me $[...] to pay the outrageous rip-off price for a European Region 2 coded DVD that will probably play like [...]anyway!

Thanks for listening.",1147305600,12,798,4.697841726618705

7990992,2,B00009KP26,Hi! This edition has several cuts on important scenes. And the spanish subtitles are not very well synchronized! So watch out before buying this DVD. I can't understand why they've cut such important scenes. I have this film on VHS and all these scenes are there!,1424044800,,263,4.739130434782608

7990994,1,B00009KP26,This might be an old DVD but the picture quality is really very bad. Not pleasant to watch even for a good movie like this.,1334188800,,123,3.96
7990995,1,B00009KP26,"I ran cross country/track in college in the early 70s and I remember when this movie came out and was excited, especially since I liked M Douglas, and competing in the B Rogers & F Shorter era.  Over the years I have been extremely disappointed that I could not find a copy to see it again.  I'm kind of a running movie junkie owning  a number of similar movies (DVDs): Prefontaine (J Leto), The Jericho Mile (P Strauss), On The Edge (B Dern), The Loneliest Runner (M Landon),  Without Limits - Prefontaine (B Croudup), Running Brave (R Benson), ... in my DVD collection.

Picking up this DVD a month-or-so ago I was astounded how up-side-down my memories of this movie were  ---  ouch.  Have watched the Prefontaine and Running Brave movies numerous times, but I will not watch Running again as it accumulates dust on my bookshelf.  M Douglas is still a favorite, but this movie is a thumbs down.",1311724800,,897,4.55625
7990996,4,B00009KP26,"I saw this movie on TV a few years after it came out. I'm a runner and I LOVED it, as I suspect most runners would....IF they could see it! This site is the only place I can find it now and it's obviously quite a bit more expensive than the average DVD - especially for a movie that's almost 30 years old! Ugh! I would absolutely LOVE to see it again, but I just can't see spending this kind of cash on a DVD...

7990997,1,B00009KP26,I saw this movie when it came out and it was trully awful. The studio had to find overweight runners to make Douglas look small in the trials scene and for the scenes in Montreal. The plot was predicable but probably appeals to runners whose goal is to break 5 hours in the marathon. Don't waste your money or time watching this one.,1197763200,,333,4.301587301587301
