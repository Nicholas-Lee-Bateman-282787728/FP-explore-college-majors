4017142,5,B002ZD3V0Q,"Every fan and performer of gospel music will want to rush out and buy this new DVD set, which features 8 hours and 16 minutes of unadulterated performances from TV Gospel Time.  The half hour Chicago-based syndicated show aired on NBC Sunday mornings from 1962-1965, the forerunner of the more famous Chicago gospel series, Jubilee Showcase. Hosted by various big-name gospel artists, the shows focused entirely on the music and were devoid of any overt religious messages or sermons. Consequently, they introduced black gospel music to a much broader audience during the peak years of the Civil Rights Movement.  Of the more than 60 shows broadcast in the early `60s, 16 extant programs have been selected for this set.  Transferred from kinescopes, the picture is often poor and the sound quality only fair (as one might expect), but the rousing performances more than compensate for any flaws.

According to the very scant notes on the box, the guests were usually filmed on location to save on travel costs (specific locations are not indicated, though are occasionally mentioned by program hosts).  Consequently, guests include a mix of recording artists and regional talent, with back-up choirs drawn from local congregations such as the Golden Leaf Baptist Choir of Memphis and the combined Gospel Light and Glory Gospel Choruses of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Song choices are Golden Age classics, such as ""Every Time I Feel the Spirit"" (sung by Marie Knight), ""Nobody Knows"" (Highway QCs), ""I'm Goin' Home on the Morning Train"" (Ruth Brown), and ""There's Not a Friend Like Jesus"" (Ernestine Washington).  This is down home gospel, straight from the church to the screen, without any hint of commercialization (other than the commercials for laxatives and skin lightening creams).

Of the eight shows included on Disc 1, three are hosted by James Cleveland (with the St. Pauls Disciple Choir, Rising Echoes, and Georgia Lewis), two by Marie Knight (with the Pentecostal Temple Choir and Golden Leaf Baptist Choir of Memphis, the Highway QCs, and the Caravans with Albertina Walker), and one each by Tommy Brown (with the Gospel Seekers), Ruth Brown (with the Highway QCs and New Shiloh Choir of Baltimore), and Ernestine Washington (with the Cornerstone Baptist Church of Baltimore and Three Professors of Gospel).  Pressing the boundaries a bit further towards contemporary gospel is a performance of  ""Amazing Grace"" by the Harmonizing Four, utilizing spoken shouts over electric guitar riffs, and the Mighty Clouds of Joy led by Joe Ligon in an electrified version of their first hit single, ""Steal Away.""

Disc 2 follows with eight additional shows, hosted by Goldia Haynes (backed by The Harmonizing Four with the combined Gospel Light/Glory Gospel Choruses), Sister Jessie Mae Renfro (with the Mighty Clouds of Joy), The Original Five Blind Boys of Mississippi (in a fabulous performance with Chicago's Barrett Sisters accompanied by Roberta Martin on piano and the Thompson Community Singers), Archie Dennis Jr. (with Ethel Davenport, the Olivette Inspirational Choir, and the Pilgrim Jubilee Singers), Larry Fuller (with Vee-Jay recording artist Princess Stewart,  backed by the Bethel Baptist Church Choir of Brooklyn and the Herman Stevens Singers), Frank Davis (featuring The Dixie Hummingbirds legendary performance of ""Prayer for Peace"" about the assassination of JFK, plus Chicago's Myrtle Jackson and the Bibleway Joy Bell Singers), Francis Cole (with the Alex Bradford Singers, Sally Martin, and the youthful C.O.G.I.C. Refreshing Spring Choir from Washington, DC), and Betty Johnson (with the Harmonizing Four, Columbus Smith, the Jewel Gospel Singers, and two talented youth choirs from Richmond, VA that steal the show).

Each disc concludes with bonus tracks featuring four minute segments of Mahalia Jackson Sings, filmed in 1961 to use as filler material for other programs.  Here the sound and picture quality is quite good, with Jackson front and center in all her splendid glory (beware of some extremely long pauses between segments). The individual songs are not indexed, but include renditions of ""Walk On,"" ""Lord Don't Move the Mountain,"" ""Highway to Heaven,""  ""Lord's Prayer,""  and  ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee,"" among others (it appears that Infinity will be releasing all of the segments next month on the compilation A Gospel Calling: Mahalia Jackson Sings).

Overall, Soul of the Church indeed documents the gospel roots of soul, offering up ""Golden Age"" standards alongside transitional performances.  Too bad the producers didn't spend a little extra money to provide liner notes and a table of contents, since no doubt many educators will want to use this material in the classroom.  Let's hope that more shows will be released in the near future, including those featuring the incomparable Sister Rosetta Tharpe and the Soul Stirrers, as well as episodes from Jubilee Showcase.",1269820800,25,4925,5.314028314028314

8384670,5,B002ZD3V0Q,"First let me agree that the picture quality is not the greatest but please don't let that stop you from grabbing this collection. This is an astounding document of a music that is not well documented. What is amazing is that these shows still exist and that someone saw fit to release them!  (After all, there isn't even a good collection of The Jack Benny Show available yet.) I'll take these shows in any form I can get them.

They should never have released this under the title it has. It should be called what it is ""TV Gospel Time""; classic Black Gospel programing from Gospel's golden age. Then they should have slapped a list of names on the cover like: James Cleveland, Albertina Walker and the Caravans, Marie Knight, Highway QC's, The Harmonizing Four, Ernestine Washington, Blind Boys of Mississippi, Roberta Martin, Mighty Clouds of Joy, Sallie Martin, Alex Bradford, The Dixie Hummingbirds, Mahalia Jackson and many other well known and less known but immensely talented artists.

The review by 'Black Grooves' gives a better description of this collection than anything you will get with the set itself. Yet despite the inept packaging we owe a huge debt to Hollywood Select Video for making this stuff available. I hope there will be a Volume Two (there are other programs from this series out there). It's a riveting assemblage of talent and a wonderful glimpse back to a time when artists would unashamedly croon, jump, shout, testify and proclaim Jesus on television in a way we will never see again.

Spiritually, musically and historically important. A must see for almost everyone. Besides that, it's just a lot of fun!",1359849600,,1641,4.870967741935484
8384671,5,B002ZD3V0Q,I recommend mostly for the music which is incredible and raw. It is like eating home cooking. But it is also fascinating to see the commercials and how over the 3 years this show was on production and commercialization developed. Plus  the black & white TV format is compelling.,1341014400,,278,4.673469387755102

8384673,5,B002ZD3V0Q,"This is unbelievable. Got this a couple days ago. A Chicago gospel program from the 60's. Haven't  watched both complete discs but I think I can safely say, 'This is awesome.' James Cleveland hosts 3 segments. And he sings on each of them. 'James Cleveland' in his prime. Albertina Walker with the Caravans. Inez Andrews and a teenage Shirley Ceasar in the background. The Harmonizing Four. The Pilgrim Jubilees doing 'Old Ship Of Zion'. The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Prof. Charles Taylor. Marie Knight. I've been OD'ing on classic gospel for the last couple days. And the thing is nobody seems to be interested in this stuff anymore. I'm telling everybody about this. If you can get your hands on a copy, I suggest you do so as soon as you can. Somebody spoke of the clarity of the black and white. But, that's the way it was done back then. The lighting is atrocious. But, I can deal with that. The camera work is stilted. But I can deal with that. Now I have to search for more of this stuff.
