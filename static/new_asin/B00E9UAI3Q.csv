8603040,1,B00E9UAI3Q,"I purchased this DVD to show the movie to English-speaking friends. I already have the French DVD. Advertising for this DVD is totally misleading: it assures us there are English subtitles, but there are only Korean subtitles (1/1). I don't understand how Amazon can support this kind of deception.",1511568000,,298,5.1020408163265305
8603041,5,B00E9UAI3Q,"I have shown this movie to at least 30 people, including a French-born film teacher in America. All are unanimous in its praise. This is a first-class film production that is absolutely hilarious, inspiring and wise!",1504396800,,216,5.027777777777778
8603042,5,B00E9UAI3Q,"Awesome movie: very deep philosophical questions get answered in an extremely entertaining way. Hilarious, funny, sometimes sad, then witty and so thought provoking, that 1996 it got censored in France and the EU! I was amazed how well the movie got put into obscurity for so many years. Only a recommendation brought it to my awareness. Today in 2017 you sit and wonder how the movie makers got the idea to show higher consciousness rituals that create Blue Spheres for space travel!
One of my preferred moments is when Mila, the human visitor from the Beautiful Green planet, psychically ""shortcuts"" politicians and moderators live on TV... and instantly they loose all abilities to lie. The truth they suddenly babble shows the hidden madness and political lies that they really think. I almost fell off the seat laughing. It's nothing completely new, because anybody who isn't a sheeple has always thought similar things, but seeing it on the ""big screen"" made me laugh and wish we could have these psychic powers to get the truth out. Watched it now several times, because it's so deep and funny, there's plenty other layers to discover every time. Great classic!",1502323200,2,1168,4.964285714285714

8603048,5,B00E9UAI3Q,"This is a wonderful film.  (Genovein, a member of GCCAlliance.org in Arizona  says it's her favorite movie.)  It does a good job of showing how crazy we are here on this planet.  We are paid a visit by a few people from elsewhere, where they live much more sanely.  Very nice.
If, however, you want to make the most of this particular version, you should be able either to understand spoken french ... or be able to read Korean.",1423785600,3,428,4.367088607594937
8603049,1,B00E9UAI3Q,"I love this movie!  Unfortunately, this dvd is in French with Korean subtitles.  Why then is the title in ENGLISH?????  This is not mentioned in the description, but I really wanted a copy of this hard to find movie, so I took a chance.  Now I have to learn to speak French, or read in Korean, or do without it....  I donated it to a Korean speaker who I hope will enjoy it....",1411516800,15,377,4.109589041095891
