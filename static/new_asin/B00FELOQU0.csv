8645663,1,B00FELOQU0,I was very disappointed with the content of the video.  It seemed to be more about the author's showcasing and bragging about what he had accomplished rather than truly helping those who are interested in building a log home receive complete instruction on how to do so. Don't be deceived by the front cover of the video as I was.  I hate that I wasted my money.,1470441600,,362,4.388059701492537
8645664,3,B00FELOQU0,"Some good tips. It's 1h30 long, so don't expect an actual course. Useful up to building the walls. After that, you get the feeling the author lost interest in the video and cruised over the rest to the point of making the part that was supposed to cover roofing and insulation, useless.
I tried to contact them twice, and never heard back, so pray you won't need any form of customer support because there is none.",1451520000,,414,4.4605263157894735
