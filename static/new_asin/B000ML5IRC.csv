8169716,5,B000ML5IRC,"Though the film is sold as a comedy, it is a true story. The lighthearted moments are wonderful and funny; a so-to-speak, Parody. The tragic events in the film are fact. - and really did happen. The closer you get to the end the less lighthearted moments there are. You only hope the doctor and his bride make it out of the country safe before the NKVD catch them. Unfortunetly there is no happy end. Tragedy becomes Reality. The doctor(colonel) and his helpers,the lieutenant and the four soldiers become the true hero's of Poland. They are caught. The pregnant bride set free, but never to see her husband again. A small piece of history comes to light in this wonderful film. -Long Live Poland-.",1514246400,,698,4.637096774193548
