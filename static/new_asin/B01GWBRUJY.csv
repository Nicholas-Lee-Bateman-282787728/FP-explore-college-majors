8763684,5,B01GWBRUJY,"Kevin Costner did a magnificent job making this film. He told a real story, with great characters. He did have the endless, thousand shot, gun fight at the end, but otherwise this was a great movie. The Alberta scenery is inspiring. I must have watched this movie eight times, a first for me.",1535932800,,292,4.528301886792453
