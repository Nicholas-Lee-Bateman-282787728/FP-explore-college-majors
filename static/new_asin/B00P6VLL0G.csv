6788011,3,B00P6VLL0G,"Whats it about?

Jeremy Renner stars in the true story of a journalist who stumbled into the shady world of the CIAs drug dealings in Venezuela during the Cold War. Investigating the story could be the opportunity of a lifetime but it risks cutting that lifetime short.

What did I think?

This true story tells the horrifying reality of the grey areas in which the CIA has dealt in the past. For a film with such a shocking story to tell it seems to struggle to capture that tone. It feels like a shorter story stretched thin and long. Like drinking two big glasses of lite milk instead of one of full cream, I was getting all the goodness of the contents but it never seemed satisfying and by the end I was feeling decidedly bloated.",1419897600,5,735,4.389705882352941
6788012,4,B00P6VLL0G,"Based on Gary Webb's biographical book ""Dark Alliance"" and Nick Schou's follow up ""Kill the Messenger,"" this R-rated script by Peter Landesman and Nick Schou is directed by Michael Cuesta (""Homeland"").

This involving but harrowing story explains how an illegal cocaine-for- arms deal was cobbled together by the CIA to fund anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua. Reporter Gary Webb's work threatens to uncover some closely guarded secrets. We soon see how character assassination works as governmental agencies begin to debunk his expos and deny any connection to drug trafficking.

This gold-star cast includes:
* Jeremy Renner (""American Hustle"") is wonderful as Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb, the investigative reporter who is handed a transcript of testimony from a grand jury hearing. He is stunned to see a cover up between cocaine traffickers and governmental agencies; he immediately sets out to discover the truth.
* Rosemarie DeWitt (The Watch"""") is his wife Sue. She has faithfully come with him to California, but there is ""too much sun!""
* Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Alex of Venice"") plays Anna, Webb's editor. She tries to talk him out of his big story.
* Michael Sheen (""Admission"") brings us Fred Weil, the fellow from the National Security Agency. He cautions our hero, ""Some stories are too true to tell!""
* Ray Liotta (Muppets Most Wanted"") John Cullen was deeply involved on both sides of the conspiracy, so he is determined to clear his own conscience.
* Michael K. Williams (""RoboCop"") as Ricky Ross, the jailed cocaine kingpin who is the first to explain to Gary the connection between drugs and the U.S. government.

As you might expect, it's hard to find any good guys as the smear campaign against our hero gains momentum. Please stay for the post script; it's important!",1415404800,10,1796,5.1020408163265305
6788013,4,B00P6VLL0G,"""Kill The Messenger"" (2014 release; 112 min.) brings the real-life story of Gary Webb, an investigative reporter at the San Jose Mercury News. As the movie opens, we see archive footage of Nixon declaring the ""war on drugs"", with subsequent presidents repeating (and expanding) the declaration. Then we shift to ""California, 1996"". Things start innocently with Webb writing how the government seizes all property of suspected drug criminals, and then fails to return the property, even if the suspect later was cleared. Based on some tips that the article generates, Webb's investigation eventually leads him to how the crack cocaine explosion in the mid-80s may have come about. To tell you more of this plot heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, ""Kill the Messenger"" is mostly a political drama, and to a lesser degree also a crime drama. The movie can really be divided up into two parts: part one is Webb's dogged investigation, and if you have seen ""All The President's Men"", it will feel very familiar. Webb has one major psychological disadvantage: he is in it all alone, while at least Woodward and Bernstein had each other. The second part is the long fall-out from the eventual article that is published. There are a number of things that will likely upset if not enrage you, such as the professional jealousy between newspapers (check the NY Times and LA Times, embarrassed that a ""small regional"" newspaper like the Mercury News was able to dig this up, and what these papers then did about it), but of course of much bigger consequence is the response from the US government. At one point, someone comments that the people in government are mostly ""attracted by power, addicted to power, devoured by power"". Second, Jeremy Renner is the true star of the movie (he also co-produced it), carrying the movie on his shoulders. His performance as the Mercury Star reporter is monumental, and certainly the best of his career to date. There are many other notable performances including Rosemary DeWitt as Webb's wife, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who shone in that indie movie ""Smashed"" in 2012) as Webb's editor, etc., but beware: Ray Liotta, who is billed just below Renner in the credits, has no more that 5-10 minutes of screen time, towards the very end of the movie. Third, the movie was directed by Michael Cuesta, best known for directing TV episodes of Homeland, Dexter, and Six Feet Under, working from a script that is based in part on Webb's memoir ""Dark Alliance"". Last but not least, the movie features great music, including both an instrumental score (composed by Nathan Johnson) and various songs (The Clash's ""Know Your Rights"", Pearl Jam's ""Nothing As It Seems"", Mott the Hoople, Social Distortion, and others).

""Kill the Messenger"" opened last month at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati (it only played a couple of weeks). The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which is a shame. I found ""Kill the Messenger"" to be a riveting movie, holding my attention from start to finish. If you loved movies like All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, Z, Missing, and such other political thrillers, you cannot go wrong with this one. ""Kill the Messenger"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1415059200,100,3358,4.920634920634921
6788014,4,B00P6VLL0G,"This is an excellent docudrama of reporter Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner) of the San Jose Mercury News who cracked the CIA drug smuggling scandal. The first half of the film concerns his discovery of the story, traveling and talking to individuals. After the story breaks, the champagne flows, and the US is upset. It is time for CIA damage control. It seems Mr. Webb used criminals and drug dealers as a source in a story about criminals and drug dealers so he has no reliable sources. He also is not a saint and as his sources recant their story, his life spirals downward as the messenger becomes the story.

The film was done well for the most part. The personal home life of Gary Webb seemed a bit awkward especially the oldest son who laments over his father's affair like a little girl. I know they had to show us how the smear campaigned affected his life, but they could have fabricated a more believable scene.

The opening of the film has film footage of presidents and others telling us how bad drugs are for us. I couldn't help think about Mr Mackey of South Park telling us not to do drugs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M

It's up to the people to hold the gov't accountable. But it's not a government of the people, if it ever was. They have designed every law to make people criminals. You cannot leave your house without breaking the law. First they vilify you. Assassinate your character. You're the problem, not the corruption. Then they break the law, steal from you. Break into your house. Steal from the bank account that they set up through the banking system. Listen to your phones while in bed with phone companies. Spy on you online through the real big brother: Microsoft, Google, et al. You think you can step out of line? Step on their toes? The money you pay in taxes empowers them with the resources to burn down your house while you're at work paying them their wages.

6788043,1,B00P6VLL0G,"This movie keeps to the same strategy used by the CIA from day 1-- shift the topic from CIA drug-trafficking to the personality of reporter Gary Webb. The factual case that Webb makes (in his exhaustively documented book ""Dark Alliance"") of CIA evil-doing, is alluded to very briefly in the first part of the movie, and then completely ignored for the remainder of the film. Instead, we have the melodramatic story of the unraveling of Webb's professional and personal lives, without any attempt to defend him from the storm of false accusations that were designed to undermine his reporting.

Why did the San Jose Mercury cave so quickly? Clearly, because threats were passed on from the CIA to Knight Ridder (the conglomerate who owned The San Jose Mercury at the time), and from there to management of the newspaper. That's how it works folks. That's why we don't have journalism anymore. Needless to say, no mention is made of Knight Ridder in the movie.

So in the final analysis, Webb's defense is erased from the narrative, the CIA's cozy relationship with crack wholesalers is erased, and the story collapses in an absolute muddle. The  CIA is off the hook again, thanks to the friendly folks in the media conglomerates and Hollywood, who routinely do their bidding.

So Webb was eventually found in his Sacramento home with TWO bullet holes in his head. Incredibly, investigators ruled it a suicide....""let's see, bullet number one just went into my brain, but I think I'd better pull the trigger again to make sure that I've finished the job...""

As bad as the film is, as poorly as the film delves into the factual story of CIA involvement in the crack epidemic, apparently the filmmakers STILL were under pressure to limit the film's distribution, triggering an unprecedented action by the Writer's Guild of America to force a re-opening of the film.

6788068,4,B00P6VLL0G,"Excellent movie about Gary Webb's work and sad destiny, from a time where committed journalism to truth was still a thing for many honest professionals practicing it, exposing the dirty inner workings of politics and interventionism involving certain intelligence agencies and its associates. Webb's work may not been perfect, but was as close to truth as it could be, given the circumstances and nature of his subject. He got instead vicious attacks on his integrity, lack of support and commitment to dig further by his employers and other major news outlets and peers, which should have jumped in and offered support or investigate further in order to corroborate such claims where they appeared to be weak in evidence or in any case disprove it with solid arguments based on honest research. It's always easier to attack the person's integrity and leave it isolated, than to invest in digging out the truth for fear of a powerful government apparatus that not always is held accountable for its misdeeds. That was then, but today we see worst, the collusion and corruption of what once was The Fourth Power, it's only a shadow of a more glorious past, filled with trash news, paid and bought by elites and power entities to manipulate, twist and bury the dirty laundry, truth is fair game, we get flooded with ""alternate facts"", ""fake news"", outright lies, and shameless misdirection.",1485302400,11,1388,4.987068965517241

All in all, enjoyed watching it. I was hoping for a little more tension considering the plot but still a good movie.",1477958400,,498,4.522222222222222

6788087,5,B00P6VLL0G,"This is the movie version of a real story about Gary Webb,; the journalist whose life was ruined by doing his job really really well, what happens when you pry into the dark cellars of government misdeeds and bring them to light.  It was stories he followed up on that brought to light the Iran/Contra deals where the CIA was providing drugs to the poor communities in order to sustain their war in Nicaragua.  Very slimy stuff!  Here is this family man reporter and the more he finds out and the deeper in it he gets, the more his life becomes unraveled.  Very sad human story for him and the poor souls who were sold drugs and it shows us how we need to protect our investigative journalists more than we do - instead of assuming they are ""conspiracy theorists.""  This is what is so disturbing. How so many radio shows,etc. confuse the public by either calling any old thing a conspiracy or denying that they exist at all - it's sort of mixing things up so we don't know what is true or what is not. People have to be discerning when looking at today's media.  This film shows the tightrope that some journalists have to walk and how the media bosses will turn against their own in order to survive if you step on the wrong toes.",1477612800,6,1231,4.353711790393013

6788106,4,B00P6VLL0G,"Prize winning journalist, Gary Webb, (Jeremy Renner) falls into a story of absolute corruption, reaching as far as the inner halls of the White House, involving Nicaraguan drug kings, agency spooks, following and ending in the cocaine drenched streets of LA Central. This is the story of the alleged CIA involvement in smuggling tons of the cocaine into the United States. The cocaine is sold on the streets in major cities across the nation, and the profits used to buy weapons for the Contra-rebel soldiers in Nicaragua in their attempt to bring down the Sandinista left-wing government.

What is most disturbing about this recent period in history, is the Nixon and Reagan Administration's formal declaration on their War on Drugs, when it turns out, that, they are allegedly the prime suppliers of the drugs, creating a nation-wide Crack Cocaine epidemic that continues to this day. If true, the hypocrisy transcends all rational thought, a trust in the government, and a deep psychopathy that knows no bounds.

Kill the Messenger is a true David and Goliath tale, however, in this sad case, David loses the battle and expires, while the giant walks free, and able to continue his covert criminal activities.

This story continues to be controversial. It did not make big news at the time because Bill Clinton was under investigation for his sexual escapades in the Oval office. Beginning with the Reagan Administration, it has been formally acknowledged that monies from cocaine smuggling helped fund the Contra rebels, however, it was not authorised by the U.S. Government. This begs the question: Who authorised it, then?

In an internal CIA investigation, agents were found to have worked with drug traffickers to support the Contra program. In the same breath, the report found no evidence of a conspiracy of the CIA to purchase drugs and bring them into the U.S. To be certain, this is your standard double-speak, designed to confuse, and deny responsibility.

Gary Webb experienced character assassination as a result of his published stories. The most blatant and criticised came from the LA Times. Rather than attack Webb's work, they attacked the man.

Gary Webb committed suicide in 2008 from two gunshot wounds. The fact that he died from two gun shot wounds is highly unusual. Conspiracy theories suggest he was killed for his expose' of government corruption. The coroners report on Webb's death stands  suicide.

This is an excellent film, shedding light on the corruption of government, the rogue nature of the CIA, and dubious media institutions ready to defend power with transparent bias...

6788168,3,B00P6VLL0G,"**Warning: this review contains potential spoilers.**

In August of 1996, the San Jose Mercury News broke the big one. That some elements in and around the Contras were mixed up in the drug trade wasn't exactly news: the Kerry Committee had exposed this to some degree back in the 80's. But the SJMN's series written by Gary Webb went much further. It stated that a drug network consisting of people involved with the Contras (i.e. Oscar Danilo Blandon and Norwin Meneses) were selling to LA crack kingpin Freeway Rick Ross and that this network opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Furthermore, it also stated that the cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. The role the CIA played in this was left somewhat ambiguous by the series. While not explicitly saying the CIA made a calculated attempt to encourage this, it did make innuendos about it by doing such things as constantly referring to the Contras as the CIA's army and the logo of the series was a man smoking crack superimposed on the official seal of the CIA.

The controversy that followed was one of the biggest in modern journalism. It led to papers and other outlets attacking the SJMN, and ultimately the SJMN backtracked on the story. Webb and the paper soon parted ways. Webb wrote the book 'Dark Alliance' some years later but became a pariah in journalism and never worked for a major paper again. Depressed over his inability to find work, Webb committed suicide in 2004.

Now Webb is back. Played (superbly) by Jeremy Renner he is brought back to life in this film based not only on Webb's book (i.e. 'Dark Alliance') but also Nick Schou's book 'Kill The Messenger'. From everything I've read on the man, this film captured his passion and drive for what he did, but also how that passion created difficulties for him. You also get a sense of Webb the family man (i.e. how he worked to have a good relationship with his children and also the struggles in his marriage).

But another aspect of this film are some issues with accuracy. Indeed, considering the beating the series took over accuracy....you would have thought the film would have kept the facts squeaky clean. But unfortunately: it doesn't.

As it begins, Webb's tip that broke open the story led him to court to observe Blandon's testimony. In the film, Blandon testified that the CIA came to him and Meneses and asked them to raise money for the Contras (knowing that they dealt drugs). In actuality, Blandon said Meneses or Enrique Bermudez [in the grand jury transcript called ""Enrique Ramunez""], it's not clear which one (Blandon's english wasn't clear at times), is who asked him. In either case, neither person amounts to representing the CIA: Meneses definitely was not, and Bermudez wasn't. And even if they were: Blandon himself later specifically denied that Bermudez asked him to raise money through drug smuggling. Meneses said the same thing. The SJMN quoted Bermudez (via Blandon) as saying the ""ends justify the means"". But Blandon himself said he didn't take that as meaning they should traffic in drugs.

Also, Blandon's actual testimony could easily be interpreted as he had stopped sending money to the Contras before he was selling to Ross. (Ergo, the notion of sales to Ross being funneled to the Contras was bogus.) And Ross was mixed up in selling drugs before he ever met Blandon.

The film also doesn't really develop the history of the drug (which really undermines Webb's contention). The Medellin cartel had already established contacts in LA and was importing the stuff well before Ross was in business. For example, in 1979 (before the Nicaraguan revolution happened), federal agents busted up a Colombian ring in Granada Hills that had been flying in 200-kilo cocaine loads via Lear jets and Cessnas. (Cartels like the Medellin and Cali organizations revolutionized the drug trade by switching to mass moving the merchandise (as opposed to the old ""mule"" methods).) Kingpins in south central LA like ""Tootie"" Reese had established links with the South American cartels well before then. 3 Federal investigations into this established that. (Most notably the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.) On the east coast, they had established a base of operations on Norman's Cay in 1978 that created a cocaine pipeline to the whole east coast (and beyond).

And this isn't just taking the government's word for it either. Checking several newspaper archives, I found that cocaine was all over LA county (including south central) by the late 70's. One article (entitled 'Cocaine use up for white collar workers', by the NY Times News Service and carried in several newspapers (on 9/16/1979)) stated that (according to Raymond Wells, a LA county criminologist): You can find cocaine anywhere in L.A. County, from the lower to the upper classes. Other articles found echo the same thing across the country as cocaine was about to surpass coffee as Colombia's number one export. This resulted in a glut on the cocaine market that drove prices down and made it more available. The crack aspect of it came into play as word spread as how to make it. This didn't have anything to do with the people in Dark Alliance (despite its claim that Blandon was the Johnny Appleseed of crack in California). Webb himself said he found formulas for cooking up crack going back to the 70's, and Ross specifically denied anyone associated with the Dark Alliance story ever taught him how to make crack.

As far as the manpower involved goes, in 'Dark Alliance' Webb lamented about the lack of public outrage that the CIA had worked cheek by jowl with more than 50 suspected drug traffickers. First off, they obviously were not on the payroll to run drugs (despite what some may think). They were on the payroll to keep the Contras in supply. And secondly, to put that number in perspective, according to 'The War on Drugs: An International Encyclopedia': ""an estimated 300 Colombian trafficking groups and 20,000 Colombians were involved in the cocaine trade in the United States [by the late 80's]. At least 5,000 of the Colombians who worked for the cartels lived in the Miami area and another 6,000 in the Los Angeles area."" In other words: the cartels had about as much manpower in the United States alone than were in the entire Contra movement. (The Medellin cartel employed 750,000 people in Medellin.) So needless to say, the cocaine trade wasn't hinging on 50 guys associated with the Contras.

Furthermore, the Dark Alliance series by its own numbers undermines the notion of Ross & Co. starting or maintaining such a epidemic: Webb gives the number (in 'Dark Alliance') Blandon sold to Ross at around 5 tons. By DEA estimates, more cocaine went to Los Angeles in a *single* year (i.e. 1980; before Blandon was selling to Ross) than Ross sold over 8-10 years.

It's also important to put into perspective who Ross's suppliers were: they were not Contras who went into dealing to support them.....they were dealers sympathetic to their cause who kept most of the money they made. That's an important distinction.

How much Blandon and Meneses gave to the Contras is a frequent point of contention with the story. Although Webb claimed millions, most provable estimates are between 50 to 100 thousand dollars. But simple logic can solve the problem, or at least undermine the notion we are talking millions. Up until 1984, the United States put up about 70 million for the Contras. In 1985, the war ground to a halt because Congress cut off funding (in-part triggering the Iran-Contra affair). Congress re-started funding in 1986 and ergo the war started back shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, during this period, Blandon and Ross had (literally) piles of money laying around (we are talking in the hundreds of millions). So where was this coke money when the Contras needed it? Furthermore, why even bother with the Contra aspect of Iran-Contra (which got them maybe 2 million from the diversions of the arms sales to Iran) when all that coke money was supposedly out there?

A big part of the film was the supposed CIA media campaign against Webb. (Via most of the major national newspapers. Before the movie came out, an internal document from the CIA appeared discussing how they supposedly influenced things through productive relations with journalists.) The depiction of this treatment was somewhat accurate: they did (at times) put words in his mouth. But to say the only sources for the media's scrutiny was CIA officials just isn't true. In particular, the LA Times was singled out in this regard. In the film, Webb calls a guy named Rich Kline to complain about the Times [CIA] sources for their attacks. (Since the LA Times had no one by that name on the story, I assume it was supposed to be Jesse Katz.) But in the oft-criticized LA Times story (in part because Katz had made grandiose statements about Ross before Webb's story broke), aside from law enforcement officials and former gang members, Ronald K. Siegel (a UCLA professor who was one of the first to do research on smoking cocaine) was one of the sources. Also quoted was Malcolm Klein and Cheryl Maxson, USC sociologists (Klein is considered an expert on gangs). And its obvious they did their research as the drug dealers they name are all easily verifiable. At Webb's own paper, Pete Carey (who co-wrote the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake story with Webb; a series of stories that won the staff of SJMN a Pulitzer Prize) called 30 cocaine experts and not one of them agreed with the notion ""that Ross played a critical role in either crack cocaine's origins or its eventual spread throughout the country"" (to quote a line directly from 'Kill The Messenger' (p. 155) that didn't make it into the movie).

The movie also depicts (some would say fabricates is a more accurate term) a number instances of personal harassment [and contact] of Webb by the government and its agencies. Before he even writes the story, some ""agents""/""a few guys from D.C."" meet with him and try to warn him off and also make a implied threat against his family. Ray Liota plays a CIA agent who sneaks into Webb's hotel room in the middle of the night to tell him he is right. And finally, Webb fires a warning shot at a guy hanging around his car at night. Following that, some unidentified people start going through Webb's files while he is talking to the police. To my knowledge, even Webb didn't claim any of these events happened. I think the closest thing to this was the fact Webb once shot a would-be car thief who came at him. But this was in Kentucky and years before he came across the Dark Alliance story.

As the controversy develops in the film, a montage is shown of a variety of leaders in the African-American community reacting to the story. Among those shown is one Maxine Waters, a Congressional Representative of south central LA. A well known demagog on anything relating to race, she infamously described former LA mayor Richard Riordan as a plantation owner and sat in the basement of a church during the 1992 LA riots and blamed everyone *but* the rioters for what was going on up stairs. (The latter made for one unforgettable moment of the TV show Nightline.) While Webb distanced himself from some of the accusations of people like Waters (who was anxious to find a scapegoat for the situation in her district), he failed to distance himself from them personally, which is something not addressed by the movie. (Waters wound up writing the foreword of 'Dark Alliance'.) At times, this gave the appearance of him backing some of the more outlandish charges associated with the story.

But if there was any doubt where Webb stood on the government's involvement.....it was pretty much settled once 'Dark Alliance' was published in 1998 (the timeline of the movie ends before this part of Webb's life). Not only that, it severely damaged whatever credibility Webb had left by trying to pass off some stories as genuine that are ludicrous on their face. One notable one had to be the Allen Raul Rudd story. According to Rudd (a captured Colombian trafficker), then VP George Bush flew down to Colombia to strike a deal with the Medellin cartel: they could fly as much cocaine into the USA as they wanted as long as they sold guns to the Contras. The deal was sealed with cartel leader Jorge Ochoa and Bush posing for a photo together with suitcases filled with cash. Even some of the people sympathetic to Webb (like David Corn) admitted they had a hard time keeping a straight face reading that one. To believe it, you would have to accept that Bush/Reagan carried out this agreement by shutting down the aforementioned  Norman's Cay (which was put out of business due to pressure from the US government in 1982) not to mention all the other pressure the US government was putting on them as time progressed. (Which resulted in some members of the cartel putting a bounty on members of the DEA). You'd also have to believe that no one in the Medellin cartel would bother to produce this photo as President Bush was pressuring Colombia into a war against them that would end in many of their leaders being either killed or thrown in the slammer.

Such stories demonstrate one of the inherent weaknesses of Webb's work: Too much was riding on the word of drug dealers facing some serious charges. Drug informants, indeed just about all criminal informants, are notoriously unreliable.  According to Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions (in 2004), 45.9 percent of documented wrongful capital convictions have been tied to false informant testimony (the leading cause). And drug dealers have dreamed up whoppers of this magnitude before. Probably most famously (or some would same infamously): the case of Christian David. David claimed that he knew of a Corsican hit team that were the actual assassins of President Kennedy. A producer believed him and it became the basis for the television series 'The Men Who Killed Kennedy'. (It's also important to note that David's story got some degree of corroboration from Michel Nicoli. Nicoli was a former heroin trafficker who had testified for the US government in drug trials before, and was considered by the government to be very reliable.) Later it turned out that all three assassins were overseas the day David claimed they were in Dallas. (Whoops.)

At the end of the film a number of statements appear that are somewhat misleading. For one, it mentions the the Director of the CIA's appearance in a town hall type meeting with the citizens of south central Los Angeles, and that the director left the CIA a month later. That leaves the impression Deutch left the CIA because of the Dark Alliance series. Deutch was actually forced out because the Clinton administration was upset with his testimony to Congress on Iraq. A statement is also made that the CIA released a report that acknowledged the fact  they ...associated with members of the Contra movement who engaged in drug trafficking. True. But just not the ones Webb wrote about. The mentioned report specifically denies that the agency ever had any contact with Ross, Blandon, or Meneses. Furthermore, that report (and the unmentioned DOJ report), far from being a vindication for the Dark Alliance series, blew a great many holes in the story. And finally, Webb's two shot suicide is mentioned. The movie states it was ruled a suicide. But there is little doubt. Webb had made arrangements for his cremation (as well as other things), and even his own family does not doubt it was a suicide based on his actions before hand. (Nick Schou covers this in 'Kill The Messenger'. In a way, it was kind of good this aspect of Webb's life was omitted from the film because it made for some depressing reading.)

So at the end of the day, where does this leave us? On the one hand, I liked Webb's moxie in being willing to go after something like this and challenge the establishment. It's also an important reminder of the type of people we get mixed up with in clandestine operations. (Which was a continuing theme in the Cold War.) It also forced the CIA to come clean about the fact it was looking the other way with regards to some of these people's backgrounds.

On the other hand, the overreaching (and sometimes ridiculous) claims of the series and book have put some myths into the nation's blood stream that abides to this very day. In fairness to Webb, if the series had better editorial oversight, it probably could have been saved. But apparently there was some struggle between editors (unrelated to the series) that let this slip through the cracks. However, I think Webb should have known better than to print some of the things that went into 'Dark Alliance'. (Not to mention getting involved with some people that had ties to the Christic Institute's lawsuit. For more on that, see Glenn Garvin's review of 'Dark Alliance' available on Reason.com's web site.) Also, the movie (while not a documentary) was disappointing in its handling of the facts.

So a mixed review for me....but I still recommend it.",1447891200,10,17184,4.847018739352641

6788177,5,B00P6VLL0G,"Michael Cuesta (Homeland, L.I.E., Dexter, Six Feet Under, 12 and Holding etc) knows well how to balance fact set against the fiction the governments of the world  would have us believe. Journalist Peter Landesman wrote the screenplay based on Gary Webbs series Dark Alliance (the true story on which this film is based) and Nick Schous book Kill the Messenger. The story is shattering as is the cinematic portrayal of this 1990s incident. Gary Webb is now deceased.

The film brings up memories that riveted us to the newspapers as we read the true story of journalist Gary Webb (Jeremy Renner is a quality performance) who as a reporter becomes the target of a vicious smear campaign that drives him to the point of suicide after he exposes the CIA's role in arming Contra rebels in Nicaragua and importing cocaine into California. The film takes place in the mid 1990s, when Webb uncovered the CIA's past role in importing huge amounts of cocaine into the U.S. that was aggressively sold in ghettos across the country to raise money for the Nicaraguan Contras rebel army. Despite enormous pressure not to, Webb chose to pursue the story and went public with his evidence, publishing the series ""Dark Alliance"". As a result he experienced a vicious smear campaign fueled by the CIA. At that point Webb found himself defending his integrity, his family, and his life.

The fine cast includes excellent cameos by Robert Patrick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosemarie DeWitt, Barry Pepper, Paz Vega, Tim Blake Nelson Oliver Pratt, Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta and others. The pacing of the film is fast and the tension builds slowly until we are faced with some realities we would rather not believe but must face the fact that they are true. This is an engaging and important film  a heady docudrama that needs to be seen. Grady Harp, October 15",1445731200,,1836,4.837579617834395

And this was the reason for his ultimate demise.  Per Schou, who is very sympathetic to Webb, the news articles named Dark Alliance accused the CIA of being complicit in the trafficking of crack cocaine in the first paragraph of the story and then continued to call the rebel backed army in Nicaragua that was selling the cocaine, ""the CIA's army"" repeatedly through the article.  Schou also admitted there were a lot of loose ends to Webb's story.  The movie even portrays the main support Webb had for his articles were two prison inmates who were drug dealers and the info he got from a drug dealer's girlfriend, who was trying to get her boyfriend off charges.  I find it hypocritical that both Gary Webb, and Jeremy Renner, who was very sympathetic to Webb and felt so strongly about the story, that he produced it, are willing to push a story like this, without solid sources.

6788203,5,B00P6VLL0G,"Chronicles of Panem et Circenses
Last night we watched a great film called, ""Kill the Messenger."" The movie follows the life of reporter Gary Webb, who uncovered evidence in the 1990s that illustrated an elaborate scheme devised by the CIA to sell cocaine in impoverished cities in the US as a means of raising money to support a group of sadistic rebels trying to take back Nicaragua from the Sandinista government in the 1980s. In the end the CIA funded a smear campaign that stripped Webb of his profession and eventually, led to his highly questionable ""suicide."" The film chronicled a story that I heard of first hand from former Contra soldiers in northern Nicaragua but to be honest, as I watched the it I found myself amazed not so much by the fact that the US government participated in the scheme but rather, that at the time citizens seem to be much more enraged by supposed updates on ""news"" concerning the Monica Lewinsky-Bill Clinton scandal. Now, I'll admit, using the nation's highest office to mess around on one's spouse is unethical but it clearly is a lesser crime than the CIA selling cocaine to Ricky Ross on the streets of L.A. as a means of supporting a war in a country that the majority of US citizens cannot identity on a map!
Unfortunately, things seem to have changed very little.

6788245,5,B00P6VLL0G,"The film is based on a true story and is largely set in 'Los Angeles' in the mid-90's.
Reporter 'Gary Webb'  (Jeremy Renner) stumbles upon a story of a lifetime after being given information that indicates
U.S Agencies had high-level involvement in drug-trafficking and used the profits to help fund the 'Contra-Rebels' in
'Nicaragua'
The disclosures will threaten 'Gary Webb's' career and possibly his family if he continues to pursue and uncover a secret
truth.....he had begun to step on too many official's toes.......there will be a price to pay..
'Gary' knows there was much more to uncover....would he be able to do so, or will ranks close in..
A deeply intense and suspense filled drama which follows 'Gary Webb's' determination to uncover the truth.....
A superb drama...

6788266,5,B00P6VLL0G,"As someone who knew Gary Webb -- meeting him after he called me in 1996 to consult about my early work on the Contra-cocaine issue for The Associated Press -- I found the movie a pleasant surprise, one of the few serious attempts to tell the broader American public what went wrong not only in areas of national security but also inside the mainstream news media. With subtlety, the movie captured the careerist impulses that steered editors and reporters away from such a complex and dangerous story as the Reagan administration's involvement with Contra-connected drug lords. At the AP, Brian Barger and I challenged that attitude in the mid-1980s and faced hostility not only from the CIA and the White House but from competing news organizations. When Webb revived the scandal in the mid-1990s, many of those same news outlets -- including the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times -- went after him, all the better to cover up their own cowardice and incompetence a decade earlier. When I talked to the screenwriter for ""Kill the Messenger"" early in the project, I doubted that any movie could convey that problem in an effective way. But the movie succeeded in showing the cavalier and unprofessional attitudes inside the editorial boardrooms on this touchy issue -- and Jeremy Renner captured much of the essence of Webb's personality. A worthy effort that more Americans should see.",1435276800,4,1414,4.945378151260504

6788307,4,B00P6VLL0G,"Jeremy Renner turns in one of his best performances as Gary Webb, an award winning reporter for a San Jose, California newspaper.  While investigating a story involving the Government's ""war on drugs"" policy of confiscating personal property that ""may"" have been obtained with ""drug money"" (sorry for all those ""'s) he's tipped off by one of the drug dealer's girlfriend (Paz Vega) that there is a bigger story.  She shows him secret grand jury testimony that suggests that the drug dealer is actually importing drugs for the CIA.  The drugs are being release in Los Angeles and other big cities in the form of crack cocaine.

This involvement falls on the heels of the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration between 1985-1987.  In 1996, Webb, as a result of the original tip discovered that the CIA was continuing to fund the Nicaraguan rebels with money from drug sales in the U. S.  The movie covers his background work and the resulting response from the government, the CIA in particular.  While Webb's life began to unravel as his past was investigated, his family threatened, his newspaper abandoning him and other papers questioning his sources, we see Webb begin to fall apart.

The film spends a lot of time on his relationship with his family, perhaps a bit too much.  Still, this was an important element of his life.  While the film doesn't quite meet the standards set by ""All the President's Men"" in terms of suspense and mystery, it is a well done story and certainly raises all of the issues we still seem to be facing today.  Based on some of the facts I reviewed later, the film draws some different conclusions from reality.  Renner carries the movie from beginning to end and is more than enough to recommend it.",1432339200,,1747,4.786666666666667

It will wake you up and make you face reality.

Some of the script is confusing, but watching a top notch journalist get shafted by his own paper, The San Jose Mercury News, and disdained by the LATimes, Washington Post, and New York Times is painful.  To see all of them reprise the story through from their own old points of view, when Kill the Messenger premiered, probably assured that it barely got booking outside our large cities--was just as bad.

I haven't checked the factual aspects as regards the real life saga, but I don't feel a need to as the movie wasn't asserting any thing new (that I'm aware of). My wife thinks Renner has anger issues as some of the characters he plays seems to have a major undertone of anger and violence. I don't know about that, but I could feel the frustrations of the character in this movie for sure because he conveyed it so well.
I watched quite a bit of this unfold in real time but for some reason I just don't remember this story as it happened. I remember most of the key points of the Iran-Contra affair, but I guess this story got lost on me in the background.",1428278400,,899,4.172413793103448

6788397,5,B00P6VLL0G,"Kill The Messenger is a thriller based on the book on the same title by Nick Schou and Dark Alliance by Gary Webb,the main character on the movie. It stars Jeremy Renner as Webb together with cast of talented actors and actresses namely Michael Sheen, Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta, Barry Pepper, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosemarie DeWitt, Paz Vega, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff, and Michael K. Williams.

It tells the story of Webb,an investigative reporter of the San Jose Mercury News who stumbles on a story about the U.S. government being the source of the crack epidemic on the nation's streets. He later further alleges that the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) was aware of the identity of the major drug dealers who were smuggling cocaine from Nicaragua and using profits to arm Contra rebels fighting in that country. He digs deep into the story which takes him from the streets of Los Angeles to the fighting jungles of Nicaragua. Despite warnings from the CIA agents not to write the story,he pursues the story which led him write a book called the Dark Alliance. As a result,he becomes a smear campaign by the CIA which leads him to defending his integrity,his family and his life.

The film has a great premise. It was interesting and compelling during the first half especially when Gary discovers an interesting story and when he digs deep into it. Credit Renner for a great performance. The viewer will definitely be captured especially on how links everything together. But in the second half,the film somewhat falters as it becomes somewhat paranoid and delusional when we find Webb trying to defend himself and protecting himself and his family. Too bad that it wasn't done well that the viewer would fail empathize with the conditions that Webb has gone through. Also,a lot of things about him were left in the dark as what happened to him psychologically and whether is death was definitely suicide or possibly suicide.",1427932800,,1938,4.92354740061162

6788401,5,B00P6VLL0G,"My wife usually doesn't like movies docudrama type movies but ""Kill the Messenger"" surprised us, We Both Liked it!

""Kill the Messenger"" is based on a true story and chronicles the birth of the crack cocaine epidemic in the U.S. during the mid 1990 when the U.S. government was publicly raging a War on Drugs while secretly allowing major drug dealers to smuggle in huge amounts of cocaine and use the money to fund the Nicaraguan Contras rebel army.

Gary Webb (played by Jeremy Renner) uncovers information that shows the CIA is aware of the drug smuggling and despite threats by the CIA and drug cartels, Webb goes public and publishes the evidence in a series of articles catapulting him to journalistic fame. At first Webb is heralded by his colleagues as an outstanding investigative journalist but after he gets his 15 minutes of fame the tide quickly turns and suddenly Webb himself becomes the story as the CIA launches a vicious smear campaign against Webb leaving him fighting for his job, career and family.

""Kill the Messenger"" is a poignant look at how government and media can sometimes deflect and distort the message to shift focus to fit their own agenda .... definitely worth watching ... enjoy!",1427846400,2,1215,4.831730769230769

Renner utterly inhabits his characters in everything he touches, and this movie is not an exception.  His acting here is unflashy, but three-dimensional, human and true.

As for Gary Webb's story, it's still being white-washed -- witness the luke-warm reception (if not outright silence the movie got from the mainstream media whose fecklessness it so brilliantly indicts.

6788414,5,B00P6VLL0G,"I remember back when I first saw the trailer for this film and being fairly certain I would love this film. It has a couple of things that immediately get my attention. First, it's a fact-based drama with an investigative bent, and second, it has a great cast with people I like to see onscreen. Jeremy Renner leads the cast as Gary Webb, a former journalist for the San Jose Mercury News, who broke the story of CIA complicity in the drug trade during the 1980's as a way of funding the Contras in Nicaragua. It's an incredible story of government corruption and someday I will finally break down and read ""Dark Alliance,"" but as a movie it's just as riveting as you can imagine. However, the actual investigative journalism is only part of the story in KILL THE MESSENGER. The film also examines the fallout from the story and how it negatively affected Gary Webb's life and career. What I admired most about the film was how well-written it was, particularly Gary Webb. Even though it was great to watch him do his job, you also got to see his family life, so that it ended up being a well-rounded portrayal. And, of course, Jeremy Renner nails it. The other cast members don't get as much screen time, but they do well with what they were given to do. The only thing that bothers me is how unrecognized this film went last year. Like NIGHTCRAWLER for Jake Gyllenhaal, this film was a prestige picture designed as a showcase for Jeremy Renner, but it kind of flew under the radar. For me, it covers extremely interesting subject material, handles it in kind of a typical way, but is so well-written and acted that you can't help but be engaged. Far more than just a tale of government corruption, KILL THE MESSENGER is the portrait of a man who uncovers some very hard truths and is destroyed for it. I highly recommend that you not only check this film out, but read the book by Gary Webb (as I intend to do).",1427414400,6,1913,4.452991452991453

6788445,4,B00P6VLL0G,"While Kill the Messenger has its slow parts, this movie is a fascinating retelling of a TRUE story so many people wanted to deny, and so many government scumbags tried desperately to make go away.  This is not Die Hard.  The good guys in real life get their teeth kicked in quite often.  And poor Webb's story is one of those stark warnings against opposing the American government.

In this movie you will see how this intrepid reporter revealed the truth of our government's illegal (and quite evil) dealings with drug dealers in one country and rebels in another.  How the USA meddles in other countries' affairs and is willing to sacrifice its own citizens to do so.  And the lengths to which the government is willing to go to shut you up.  No one in your life, personal or professional, is out of reach.  They can destroy your life and your reputation before they ever actually TAKE your life.

In a world where Snowden and his kind are hunted by the USA, and Homeland Security seems more like 1984's Big Brother, this movie is an important reminder that we are on the verge of losing the ""Land of the Free.""  If we have not already lost it, frankly.

This is NOT a feel good story, but it is damn interesting.  Rather, it is the story of a martyr who threatened the government and paid the price.

In fact, as you may already know, the US government murdered Webb a few years after the events in this movie.  Two bullets to the head--deemed SUICIDE officially.  How scary is that?

Enjoy the movie, and then re-evaluate what is important to you as an American.  We are a country no longer run by the people, but we the people can make a difference.  At a great cost, yes.  RIP Mr. Webb",1426636800,,1692,4.41747572815534

(I'm better with movies than books).  I wish it would have gotten more publicity or acknowledgment, but I really love this movie and have a serious movie star crush on Jeremy Renner afterwards too.  Not just as an actor and cute guy, but someone who was inspired by this must tell story and took his own personal risk both personally and financially to see that the story be told to the world.  When I saw this movie in the theater, I knew immediately that I would have to own it in my personal library.  Thank you Jeremy Renner for telling this story in such a visual and memorable way.  When I saw the reports on the news I didn't realize all that was involved in getting that story told.  There are not a lot of journalists who have that kind of integrity and take such personal risks to their careers, families, or own lives, to be sure that the truth is told...and we as a society should be sure to stand up for those who take our right to the truth so seriously and and against those who squash or murder them like they did Gary Webb.

Having grown up in the 80s I was fairly familiar with the Iran Contra and Oliver North debacle that occurred within those years.  I was less familiar with Webb and his involvement with the story.  I wasn't so sure I would really like this movie before I watched but I was pleasantly surprised as this movie was better than I expected.

Renner plays his role very well and believably and has a good supporting cast, including Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia.  Unfortunately their screen appearances are very brief though.  The story is a very believable political/docudrama and although I cant say how true to life it is, it does seem to stay pretty close to what I remember about the scandal.  It is the kind of movie that makes you shake your head and wonder how there were no consequences for the actions of those responsible.

A worthwhile watch.

So the Hollywood liberals decided to make yet another anti-American the socialist movie from there far-left liberal pro-socialistic Obama prop up the Democratic Party twaddle. And lots of liberal reviewers here, who have been brainwashed by the liberal academia, the liberal media, and bizzaro Hollywood radical leftists FrEaKs, are spewing out only what they have been taught, (i.e., brainwashed); they truly know not what they do. America is headed towards demolition, and in my opinion it shall not be stopped. Sad to watch a once great country be torn to pieces by its own citizens through some mental illness to kill itself. If you have any sense of understanding that America is a positive force, not negative, though not perfect, stay away from this wacky communist propaganda poppycock.

While we are at it: Why does anybody take any actor or actress seriously? There are usually mentally deranged mentally ill people, who for some reason got famous, and now their fame somehow equates to them having some sort of intelligence, which is far from the truth, and the sheep out there continue to adulate them as if they're better than everybody else, though they're actually much more sick than the average person, which leads them to the mental illness of liberalism.

Anyone still hoping that America has any chance is being unrealistic; that psychotic socialist Hillary is on the way, and shall finish the job once and for all; America shall short thrift be done for eternity.

6788477,4,B00P6VLL0G,"This is a very tension filled, tightly directed thriller that leaves the viewer satisfied in creating a thought provoking ordeal. This is based on two different books: Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion by Gary Webb, and, Kill the Messenger by Nick Schou. This has a wonderful cast of actors. The amazing talented Jeremy Renner in a fantastic performance, that is believable and very intense with intrigue. This is also his first feature that he has produced in the film making world.

This is directed by Michael Cuesta, who I have followed since seeing his amazing one of a kind, independent masterpiece of film, 2001s L.I.E. He also directed another one of my favorite films and is an often overlooked film, 12 and Holding. Both L.I.E. and 12 and Holding are brilliant, original, thought provoking and emotional films that leave the viewer, in total, cinematic bliss. He is a director, that is able, to hold the story and craft a somewhat, mastery, around the subject matter of his films. Simply put, I feel, he can capture real life on screen, and make you believe what is happening on screen as truth.

This is a thought provoking story in that it is based, in some truth. The movie does showcase some of the real truths, of the real life story. Gary Webb who is a journalist wrote some articles in 1996 for the San Jose Mercury News. The book Dark Alliance, is based on those articles. What Gary wrote and believed, was the CIA helped and supported the cocaine trafficking into America. The CIA helped and worked with Nicaraguan Contra Rebels and knew about, and allowed, the overall distribution of the drugs causing the massive crack epidemic. Now Webb was basically laughed at, and made a fool of when he wrote about this truth. Dark Alliance showcases that reality in exposing the truth, and then the truth not being taken serious.

Webbs book can be looked at in two ways, as a truthful masterpiece of freedom of information, or as made up lies. One thing that is the truth, is Webb knew and understood what had happened, and I whole heartily believe in his book, and his truth, that he discovered. Inside the book, he brings forth over 450 references and first hand testimony of those who were involved. Now where the second book comes in, written by Nick Schou, which the movie is titled by, Kill the Messenger. This, the biography of Gary Webb, and his ultimate struggle to release the truth and the back lash he received because of it. Kill the Messenger: How the CIAs Crack-cocaine Controversy Destroyed Journalist Gary Webb, mixed with the book Dark Alliance, is what this movie is based on. Gary Webb to me, is a hero, and a truth seeker, and a man that believed in the truth, and gave the world the ultimate inside look of how certain spots of our own government is nothing more than criminals.

Gary Webb was a pioneer of truth, and a passionate person, that spread the truth and the ultimate cover-up of the CIA and its asinine past. Sadly Gary Webb in 2004 was found dead. Magically ruled a suicide, possible, but I feel unlikely, but like I say its possible, because Webb was destroyed, and depressed, and basically bullied, possibly into suicide, because the world of journalism that he loved so much, turned its back on him. Since his death, and since the book written by Nick Schou, many journalists are opening their eyes and seeing the truths that Gary Webb wrote about. LA Weekly, Chicago Tribune, Esquire have all taken up the charge in defending Webb or at least writing articles talking of what Webb found. Webb was shunned, destroyed, and in my viewpoint, ultimately assassinated, if not by a shady cover-up, then by the reality of being shunned and destroyed and led into suicide. It has always amazed me, how truth seekers, and pioneers of creating the path, to the real truth, are always picked on, and destroyed, and after they have been murdered, it seems the wool over the eyes have been pulled away, and the truths, that already had been real, slowly starts to take shape, and be looked at, as fact. Webb was 49 years old. Webb was shot twice in the head. Ruled a suicide and the truth was washed away. Webb wrote a three part article for the San Jose Mercury News, doing his job as an investigator journalists. He went about uncovering the ultimate lies, and hidden truths, and it cost him, his reputation, his stability, and ultimately his life.

But the most startling is the domestic policy of flooding Americas Cities with tons and tons of Cocaine. Funding covert actions the U.S. congress voted against with drug money made in American cities. At the same time signing strict drug laws into effect.

Jeremy Renner does a great job and the material is good and well paced but this poor guy gets shafted from his coworkers and family.  A bittersweet story for a small time journalist uncovering a big time story.  Unfortunately he took his own life probably from all of the pent up BS he had to endure.

There are a few documentaries on YouTube with tell the rest of the story,  1)The Mena Connection,  and 2) Mena:  Obstruction of Justice.

I am not a fan of Alex Jones at all,  but it's worth watching his interviews with ""Freeway"" Ricky Ross and Celerino Castillo for the information contained within.

Also interesting is the CSPAN footage of Rep.  Maxine Waters,  who's South Central Los Angeles congressional district was ravaged by the crack cocaine imported by our government to fund a guerilla war.  Waters traveled to South America in Gary Webb's footsteps,  in order to obtain her information first hand.

It's worth noting that during this Iran-Contra drug and arms trafficking era,  the presidential administrations enacted mandatory sentencing,  three strikes programs,  and privatized the prison industries starting with California and Texas.  Reagan was from Cali,  Bush from Texas.

The powers that be want this movie and this story to die once and for all,  because it shows the drug war,  the government,  and the agencies fighting the drug war are a scam.

Now this is just supposition,  but I think that the government firearm and drug trafficking still goes on today.  Imo,  Operation Fast and Furious was the modern day version,  but out government got wise and decided to let the cartels carry their own weapons from US gun stores as they watched from a safe distance.  If the operation's cover was blown,  the agencies could just swoop in and claim it's part of an ongoing investigation.  Then there is the testimony of Zambada-Niebla,  who claims that the government gave the Sinaloa cartel blanche access to Chicago.

It's also worth noting that although Webb's story centered on South Central Los Angeles,  they were also operating in other US cities such as New York,  Atlanta,  and other US cities.",1424476800,2,2036,4.928783382789318

6788633,5,B00P6VLL0G,"5 STARS FOR KILL THE MESSENGER!!!! 5!!!!5!!!!5!!!!5!!!!  A true story that is all about how illegal drugs were used strategically to fuel war in Nicaragua. This was described convincingly to be done in an attempt to finish off the Cold War. The United States government is soberly presented despite the content and lies. It is sad to know the war on drugs began around the same time the same government was covertly allowing drug cartel's corruptions to run free in Central and North America. The reality was not clear then, but that this did in fact occur to help boost the fight against the revolution across Central America. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is clearly defined when a news story is released describing what occurred and that the U.S. Government was aware of the import of Cocaine into the United States. The movie then shows a following cover up to suppress and eliminate the reporters story, witnesses, leads, and value. The movie shows a twisted reality with the news agencies themselves that are seemingly filled with fabrications, discrediting one or their own. The original news story is scary, foggy, and filled with the so called grey areas. This movie shows a side of the First Amendment and when it is manipulated to suppress the truth. This movie also shows a reality rarely presented to the United States public when it comes to government transparency. The same energy in the movie that created this story that could help the public in KILL THE MESSENGER, shows the reality of the First Amendment later being abused. Cover ups exist even with free speech, and is something that affected U.S. Citizens throughout history. There is a huge positive, and negative reality about the United States' war on drugs in KILL THE MESSENGER. Anyone interested in United States foreign policy, C.I.A. Central Intelligence Agency, Color of Law violations, F.B.I. Federal Bureau of Investigation, and United States history will find this movie to be very historical. If you like nonfiction this seems close to that genre. There is also a book the movie is mentioned to be based on which may be more direct, and to the point, discussing the exact details as to what started, and ended, the search for the truth. Reporting about the United States government is always risky if on the wrong end of the power surge. The lead character which is the reporter that discovered the controversial story ends up without any supporters, which is possibly why the title is KILL THE MESSENGER. The movie is definitely worth watching. If you ever watched the news, or believe in the importance of the freedom of speech this is a good movie for you.",1423785600,39,2660,4.8719646799117

'Kill the Messenger' is the negative image of 'American Sniper', a counterpunch in some strange contest of propaganda cinema. Like 'American Sniper', it's also a very entertaining film; it isn't groundbreaking, as it follows a deep narrative track carved out by movies like 'All the Presidents Men' and 'JFK'. There's an inevitability to the plot that doesn't trace back to the title, or even the viewer's familiarity with the book or the original articles; it feels inevitable because it's predictable, and it's predictable because its been done. The only reason a legit true story has for fitting itself to the well-worn grooves and cogs of Hollywood formula is because it's targeting a wider audience. But as was the case in 'American Sniper', smoothing those rough edges for the sake of mass appeal makes it harder to hang on to, less memorable and less true. The compromises that converted these true-life biopics into Hollywood product are also the variables that kept them from greatness.

The 'Sniper/Messenger' parallel is purely conjectural, but the similarities aren't hard to spot. Both films are based on best-selling books about public figures who did something remarkable, but were also heavily criticised for their accomplishments. Chris Kyle was a Navy SEAL who killed over 150 people as a sniper in the occupation of Iraq, more than any other sniper in US military history. Gary Webb was a San Jose Mercury News Reporter who exposed the link between the CIA's funding of Nicaraguan rebels and the widespread trafficking of crack cocaine in cities across the US. Both men become symbols for a political POV, and both men died by gunshot wounds to the head -- Kyle by another veteran allegedly suffering from PTSD, while Webb's death was ruled a suicide. Conspiracy theories accusing the government for responsibility in both deaths are fairly popular; Webb suffered two fatal gunshot wounds to the head, which always raises red flags in a death that was ruled as a suicide.

Although Webb was initially celebrated in the journalistic community, organizations like the LA Times and Washington Post criticized his series of articles -- 'Dark Alliance' -- as ethically reckless, and discredited both Webb and his work. He was never able to support himself as a journalist after his editor backed away from the stories. Claims that Webb was the victim of a smear campaign form the basic premise of 'Kill the Messenger'.

Even though I was well aware of Webb's articles -- which were later vindicated to a large extent by a CIA document admitting to their involvement with known drug traffickers -- it was still fascinating to watch as Webb began pulling at the threads of the mask, the cover-up, which were hanging there for anyone to pull, but no one did. It was a sloppy operation, which kind of makes sense when you realize that the CIA are better at acting like spies than being spies. Like any huge, government bureaucracy, there were too many people to keep the secret forever. But they're well aware that forever isn't necessary. They just have to keep it long enough to protect the company men and important assets who were directly involved. So the truth always comes out, twenty or thirty years later, and its all new faces by then, who insist that the CIA is done with drugs and president killing. Or maybe not.

Jeremy Renner is a great actor, and he does an excellent job as Webb. If it's a warrior to warrior battle between Jeremy Renner and 'The Hurt Locker' versus Bradley Cooper and 'American Sniper', there's no question -- 'The Hurt Locker' is a masterpiece, and Renner killed it; 'American Sniper' is a good movie, but not on that same level of greatness. 'Kill the Messenger' isn't on that level either... it's enjoyable, and powerful at times, but it's also clear that Webb's tale -- like Kyle's -- has been repackaged and adjusted to make it more palatable for the American public, which compromises the original story, in my opinion. Hollywood doesn't need more propaganda. And since I have my own problems with the 'War on Drugs' in the first place, a prohibition that oversteps governmental authority, I think that 'Kill the Messenger' ends up losing its grasp on the sheer hypocrisy behind the audacity; I think Gary Webb broke an important story, but the film might end up replacing the facts.

Still, it's a film worth watching. When you set the political context aside, it moves very well, with some standout supporting roles by a lot of respected actors. Oliver Platt and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great as Webb's worried, then supportive, then actively unhelpful editors. The ending bogs down, as the story becomes progressively darker, and concludes on the aforementioned inevitable and depressing note. While it's not intended to be a feel-good film, the speech Webb delivers to a now hostile room full of reporters is excruciating to watch.",1422489600,2,4902,4.951397326852977

But the story that the movie is telling is cso crazy and shows how screwed up and dirty our government is that it scares the life out of me! Im so concerned for this country after watching this...

Spoiler: The guy dies at the end: shot TWICE in the head. The court ruled it suicide.  There is something weird going on here and we need to know about it. That's why you should watch this movie So you can wake up!",1422144000,8,519,3.980769230769231
6788643,5,B00P6VLL0G,"It's disturbing how government agencies, even in the ""transparent"" age of Obama, still blow money and manpower on ""image management"" in an effort to manipulate the American public's perceptions of their own agencies and often to sanitize (read that: distort) the truth.  I suppose it shouldn't be too surprising considering Congress stupidly passed a rider attached to a 2012 budget bill that ended the formal ban on some domestic propaganda activities.  That story was broke by Michael Hastings, by the way.  Look him up.  Remember the bogus story of Nicaraguan MIGs or how seamlessly they went along with the Nayirah ""testimony"" of murdered incubator babies?  ""It was useful in mobilizing public opinion.""  That's not an excuse, that's an admission of guilt.  Not that they ever abided by prior laws, anyway.  Double self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head.  Maximum-speed single-car collisions with sparks flying out prior to the collision.  Yep.  ""Nothing to see here folks.""  ""There are no conspiracies.""  You do realize the guys who actually built the new NSA domestic fiber eavesdropping & data mining system went to Congress privately and then the press when that didn't work and said they built in protections and safe guards against abuse that were promptly removed when the system went active?  I suppose that was an accident, too?  FBI raided them and tried to prosecute.  There is no end to the lies.  Good to see this story of other, less well-known Contras funding avenues (which itself was illegal to begin with, not to mention the additionally-illegal secret arms sales to Iran that was skimmed from and then this) and the shameful beltway press protecting their ""access"" by kowtowing to pressure was finally made into a film, even if it only had a limited distribution and was difficult to find.  The crew and cast finished the film in spite of the threats and the pressure put on them.  Kudos.  Seek it out and tell your friends.  This wasn't the first such incident and it won't be the last.  Power corrupts, and as soon as you lose the ability to rein it in and prosecute those responsible when there are excesses, it's all down hill from there.",1420934400,58,2168,4.930939226519337
