3936668,5,B002ILRCRI,"I first discovered Roller Derby back in 1970 when I was in Junior High school. My father took me to a game at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium in Sacramento California. I was hooked. I was already an avid flat track roller skater. I followed the game through its IRSL period in the late 70's and 80's. I even tried out with the training school in 1982 but did not stick with it. This Roller Derby Chronicles video set is the first time a documentary has been made about the original Derby. In 1970 The movie Derby premiered. It was great however it mostly followed Mike Snell who was attempting to break into the league. Then of course there were several movies based on Bill Griffiths 'Roller Games' from southern California. That however was NOT Derby. Leo and Jerry Seltzer were Derby.
This documentary is excellent. It interviews Jerry Seltzer who explains why Derby folded in 1973. It also interviews several original skaters from that era. Last but not least, it has several Derby games to enjoy. I could not be happier with this film. I bought it through Amazon and had it in my hands in about 3 days.
If you are a Roller Derby fan you probably already have this dvd. If not GET IT!!!",1270944000,11,1193,4.527777777777778
3936669,5,B002ILRCRI,"For the fan of Roller Derby in its early days to its proliferation in the 1970's with the San Francisco Bay Area Bombers as the epitome of this sport, this three-disc collection is a must-have item. A double-header documentary fills disc one as Rolling Thunder gives an encapsulated view of the history and ability of the best skaters on the planet - skaters who have influenced modern outbreaks of this sport in movies and arenas. Derby is the second docu-drama - with glimpses of the great Charlie O'Connell at the height of his career waxing philosophical and being thankful simultaneously. The other two discs are jammed (pun intended) with classic matches featuring The Bay Bombers, The New York Chiefs, the Red Devils, the Jolters, and the L.A. Thunderbirds. From the power of Joan Weston to the notorious Ann Calvello to the strength of Ronnie Robinson to the skill of Mike Gammon and Tony Roman to Delores Tucker and Skinny Mini Miller to Carol Meyer to the man among men, Charlie O'Connell, this set is long overdue. One can only hope more of what little extant footage can be salvaged can be put on future DVDs. If a person wonders what led to the DVD Whip It, one need look no farther than this set.",1265587200,11,1210,4.658878504672897
3936670,5,B002ILRCRI,"Roller Derby has always been one of the most controversial American entertainment events/sports.  It was born of the Great Depression, and has been described as six-day bicycle racing on roller skates.  As it evolved over the decades, the emphasis on skating eventually gave way to fisticuffs and infield ""color.""

ROLLER DERBY CHRONICLES is a fabulous three-DVD set that pays tribute to the best intentions of the family that pioneered the sport.  The festivities commence on disc one with a nearly hour-long documentary about the founders and some of the great skaters who graced the league during its heyday.  Then, the acclaimed documentary DERBY (1970) follows in its entirety.  DERBY actually crossed over to the theatrical arthouse circuit back in the day, and is still treasured by fans for its depiction of the Roller Derby world circa 1969/1970.

The other two DVDs offer a variety of games spanning the modern age of the sport, 1952-1977.  It should be noted that virtually no game films survive from the 1964-1972 era, so that particular period isn't represented here (other than the 1969/70 game footage in the documentary DERBY).  The overall visual quality is excellent, given the vintage of these games.  Many of Roller Derby's greatest stars are on display throughout.  Also included is the second half of a Canadian game from 1974, which provides a nice showcase for the Derby's primary competition, another league that called itself Roller Games.

Whether you're still an active fan, or just nostalgic for the days when Roller Derby ruled the airwaves, this three-DVD set wonderfully brings the era back to life.",1258416000,17,1631,5.136363636363637
3936671,4,B002ILRCRI,"I really enjoyed the documentary, and thought I would be more interested in all of the matches on the other discs.  They are not bad, but the more recent the matches, the cornier they get.",1416441600,,188,4.371428571428571
3936672,4,B002ILRCRI,"I absolutely loved this dvd set,but only gave it a 4 as I think they should have included more of the matchups I know they have on tape. I know The Brooklyn Red Devils vs. The Sanfrancisco bay Bombers exists because I have it on tape but would like to have it on dvd. Also they could have included The Ann Cavello Story Demon Of The Derby. I would have like to also have seen a whole feature on more in depth interviews with the skaters,Judy Arnold was no where to be found on this. Also I would have liked to have had Jerry Seltzer who had so much future thoughts when he was producing the derby answer why they did not keep the tapes of the matchups and why he did not see the want for these tapes today....Great set but missing some of the points put forth above.",1402704000,2,766,4.113333333333333

3936676,4,B002ILRCRI,"I have been a roller derby/games fan for a number of years and this film with the history of the roller derby and roller games just solidified my joy and pleasure of the game. I had my 15 minutes of fame (or should I say 2 minutes) when as a trainee with the Philadelphia Warriors, with Judy Arnold and Buddy Atkinson Jr., the trainees were allowed to show off their skating skills as future stars on the bank track during the half time break at the Philadelphia Spectrum in the 1970s. I was both excited and very nervous but did get my chance to be a jammer for a brief few seconds and will always thank God for it. I am sorry that the games today are presented as more as burlesques show of females anatomy than the tremendous skating skills of a Judy Arnold, Charlie O'Connell, Joanie Weston or Richard Brown etc...  Thanks for allowing me to reminisce!",1387584000,3,856,4.383647798742138
3936677,5,B002ILRCRI,"I'd been wanting this for 3 years, but I wasn't willing to take a $60 gamble. When I found it for $25.01, I couldn't order it fast enough. If you were ever a roller derby fan, this is a must! Comes with a deluxe package that has a raised roller derby ring on it. Unexpected nice surprise.",1362960000,3,288,4.0701754385964914
3936678,5,B002ILRCRI,"I started watching the Roller Derby in 1969 until it's demise in 1973, a true tragedy for aficionados of this unique, amazing and lost part of Americana. For the fans people like Ann Calvello, Joan Weston, Charlie O'Connell and the other bank tracked warriors were like part of our own families. While other sports have their die hard fans, the bond between the fans of Roller Derby and their banked track heroes was truly on a personal level. And we never forgot those skaters or our sport and still retain a livley interest and love for it today. This is a good set and showcases many of the top stars of the golden age of the Roller Derby and some games that capture the excitement and energy of the sport. As has been pointed out in some other reviews, little footage of the Roller Derby remains aside from a few filmed games from the 40s/50s and the final '73 season on videotape, something the fans still lament to this day. But for those that love the game or people who are just curious as to what it was all about this is a well put together set and provides many insights into the game, the players and why it all ended. Included is a Roller Games entry which shows the vast difference between the two competing leagues and also a game from the IRSL which succeeded the old Roller Derby (IRDL) and lasted another 10 years. Highly recommended!",1299369600,9,1352,4.455645161290323

8371030,5,B002ILRCRI,"This is an excellent history of the REAL ROLLER DERBY, where skaters had exceptional athletic ability and skated on a banked track.  For anyone who thinks they might like the concept of Roller Derby from the current examples of flat track skaters who grew up skating on Roller Blades, check this real history to see how the game was really played back when Gerry Murray and Mike Gammon ruled the track.  I find the 1950's through the 1970's best.  Back in the 1950's the only professional sport in which women were allowed to participate was the Roller Derby.  Many participants were flat track racing champions.  There is no comparison between today's ""Powder Puff"" skaters and the athletic women of the real Roller Derby shown in this historical compilation.  Back in those days most of the games were choreographed performances.  I doubt many of today's female skaters can skate well enough to follow a choreographed performance.

To become a Roller Derby skater one had to train under a professional skater in the Roller Derby Training School held for about 5 hours daily on weekdays.  Skaters learned how to fall properly, how to get up and continue skating after falling, how to block properly, how to whip and other nuances that made the Roller Derby what it was.  Endurance was acquired by skaters lined up single file and skating paces around the track, non-stop,  at 3/4 speed for one half hour or longer, often led by one of the coaches, who could have been Mike Gammon or Buddy Atkinson Jr.

In the 1950's the skates had wooden wheels.  The banked track was covered with a coating of green resin-like paint which added traction and helped the wooden wheels hold the track at high speed.  This paint turned into a fine green dust after skaters passed over it and a few skaters came down with serious lung diseases from skating for years in this dust.  Plastic wheels became popular in the 1960's making the resin coated track unnecessary and the green paint was discontinued.  With the plastic wheels the rules changed.  Skaters became designated jammers or blockers and wore identifying helmets.  Until this time there were no designations and no helmets.

Women DID NOT WEAR HOT PANTS when skating.  They wore padded skating tights as the men did.  Back then people came to see the athleticism of the skaters and hard fought competitions.  Today's fans come to see T & A and women fighting like wild cats after every jam.  (I suppose protective wear is not necessary for women skaters today as the women don't reach the same speeds they used to reach when they were well trained skaters.)",1451952000,5,2601,4.7825112107623315

8371032,3,B002ILRCRI,"I enjoyed the actual Documentry and the Movie Derby,which was my main reason for the purchase. The reprint of Frank DeFord's Sports Illustrated story was a great touch. My disapointment is with the two other discs with the match's. Most of the match's are just a black screen. I don't know if it's a defaulted disc or not,but that is what keeps it from getting a 5 star rating.",1447718400,,377,4.478260869565218

8371034,4,B002ILRCRI,"A very interesting collection.  It is hard to find much material on the roller game as we used to call it in Australia.  This collection shows how the game changed over the years from being quite subdued and seeming to being genuine to a more sports entertainment style.  Very unusual to see the LA T-Birds as the bad guys.

This set will bring back great memories for long time fans and be an eye opener for those who never saw the roller game.  I wish it would come back again.",1429920000,,479,4.277777777777778
