8545982,4,B00A1AU69E,"A tight, taut, short drama shot in Mexico city when that city wasn't the polluted nightmare it is now.  The narrative flows easily, and good performances from Montalban, Baxter, Marvin, and the boy keep us on edge.  Great shots of the University of Mexico campus with  its beautiful paintings.  An underrated movie that deserves a place in your dvd library, as it can be watched say, every six months or so, without getting bored.",1421107200,2,430,4.77027027027027
