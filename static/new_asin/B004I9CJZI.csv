4384743,2,B004I9CJZI,"Some movies are made that you just know will end up going direct to DVD. Sure, some deserve better but, as with WILD CHERRY, some deserve it.

The film opens with teens describing their first sexual experience. It's part of a class documentary being shot by Katlyn Chase (Rumer Willis), one of three best friends the movie focuses on. Helen (Tania Raymonde) and Trish (Kristin Cavallare) round out the trio who seem obsessed with discussing their burgeoning sexual awareness. That makes it sound better than it is. What they really discuss is losing their virginity and the rush to do so. Only Helen is holding out for a touch of romance for her first experience.

Things take a twist when it's discovered that the boys on the football team have a book and a tradition passed down since 1953. The books features a list of girls and hooks up members of the team as they must each take the virginity of one of the girls. Failure to do so will result in a losing team. The things boys will do for team spirit!

When the girls find out they attempt to organize the rest of the females on the campus of Benjamin Dover High (Ben Dover...get it?) to not put out for the males. They're not concerned about the teams scoring average on the field, but they intend to stop their scoring off the field.

Discussions of masturbation, orgasms and attempts to break down the walls erected by these girls follow. Such ""hilarious"" moments as sperm ice cubes and a punch bowl filled with Viagra just want to make you slap your knee laughing. Okay that was sarcasm, more funny than most of the scenes found here.

I suppose this movie could be considered harmless by some but the truth is if this is where the world of comedy is going we're in trouble here folks! It's as if they've taken the worst that films like PORKY'S or AMERICAN PIE had to offer and thought those were the moments that made those film funny. It wasn't!

The acting here is decent enough and Rob Schneider (whose likeness on the cover is being used to help sell this film) is wasted as the father of Helen. His moments in the film are by far the best and actually show that he's a better actor than most give him credit for.

I can't recommend this film to anyone with the exception of hormonal young teens seeking out something to giggle at. And even those will have a hard time finding anything to laugh at here. It really is that bad.

One last piece of proof. This is supposed to be a trophy winning football team on display here. And yet the stands for their school are the most ancient and unsafe looking around, not to mention barely enough to hold a single class of a high school let alone an entire school and town. Not only that the stands aren't even full. This is low budget at its worst. I mean come on, rent some mannequins if nothing else to make them look full. Then again there are more fans in the seats than perhaps ever entered a theater to watch this movie.",1309392000,,2931,4.404805914972274
4384744,3,B004I9CJZI,"""Let's teach these guys a lesson, it's pay back time.""  After a group of girls discover a book that the school football team has that lists the schools virgin girls and the player that is supposed to ""check them off"" they decide its up to them to stop the tradition.  The girls decide not to have sex at all until the season if over, while the boys try everything they can to complete the task.  This movie is nothing new at all.  The typical high school movie where everyone wants to lose thier virginity, complete with the over protective father (Schneider).  If you have kids in high school I would be very leery about watching this one.  It seems that everyone (even the virgins) are obsessed with sex and find it very difficult to hold out for the entire 3 months of the football season.  The thing that always gets me is that they always seem to cast people that are in their early 20's to play the high school students, and the over the top parties and dances are so unrealistic that some kids are dissapointed when they get to an actual high school.  That part aside this type of movie has been done a million times, most funnier then this one so don't expect anything really new.  Overall, I have seen worse movies from this genre.  A few laughs, but pretty much the same jokes that have been in every movie like this (yes, the kid experimenting with food and the surprise in your drink scenes are in this one too). I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - Not this one, but I'm sure that 100 more just like this one will be made.

8430360,3,B004I9CJZI,"After watching this I expected to find that is was a project of mostly women. I does have a woman director but was written by men. The movie is a teen sex comedy in the vain of Porky's and American Pie but this one follows the women in the story. It tries to be funny and at times has its moments but overall nothing special. While most teen sex comedies focus on the boys trying to have sex this one centers around the story of girls trying not to let the boys have sex. It has some panty and bra scenes but no nudity. It has a montage about female masturbation and has one of the girls farting. This atypical approach lead me to expect women had a bigger part in making this movie. Perhaps if they had it might have been better.
The movie also has what I think is some very clever casting. Tania Raymonde who plays the lead character Helen McNicol looks alot in this film like Shannon Elizabeth did in American Pie. John White in this movie resembles Dan Monahan as the character Pee Wee in Porky's and John White's character Franklin Peters is the clumsy, naive, goofy character that is Pee Wee.",1387584000,2,1098,4.309178743961352
8430361,1,B004I9CJZI,I LOVED Tania Raymonde playing Jodi Arias on the Lifetime movie recently aired so I bought this because she stars in it.  It isn't Tania's fault because she again great but the movie doesn't tread water.  You have teens constantly relating their first sexual experience which is a total snooze fest.  I must admit I did not watch this movie straight to the finish because it was just too boring for me to get to the end.  That's rare in a movie; it has to be awfully bad and this one is.,1372896000,,487,4.260869565217392
