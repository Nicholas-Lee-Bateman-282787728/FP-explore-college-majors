8432271,5,B004K4FUSO,"My grandson has almost every Splat book, and they are his absolute favorites. He is a beginning reader, and Splat has really inspired his interest in other stories. At 5, he was obsessed with the Marvel heroes, and Splat and friends have directed him in what I feel is a much more appropriate path! The illustrations are absolutely delightful. We all love Splat, and hope those wonderful stories just keep coming!!!",1425772800,,415,4.859154929577465
