8727859,5,B013I9RTW6,"Enjoyable mini-series.  I didn't know much about the historical aspects of the story -- the king, the living conditions, the fire -- but I just enjoyed it as I would any other book or movie.",1530835200,,190,4.428571428571429
8727860,5,B013I9RTW6,A great story.  I'll enjoy seeing it again and again.,1503619200,,53,4.3
8727861,2,B013I9RTW6,"This is the biggest bunch of historical hooey that I have seen in a many a year. There is virtually no factual basis to this melodramatic mess. The standard procedure in stopping large fires was to destroy houses as a firebreak. The only reason the fire got so badly out of control was the indecision of the Lord Mayor to do so. The conflagration reached temperatures of approaching 1300 degrees Celsius, incinerating everything in its path. It destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the city's 80,000 residents. People ran for their lives, and many didn't make it. A rumor started that the French and Dutch were responsible for the fire--but this was political, not religious hysteria. The ending nearly made me scream. The baker's house where the fire started was totally destroyed, the wood burned, the glass and metal melted. The real story of the Great Fire is fascinating and horrifying. PBS should be ashamed of themselves airing such a crock as ""historical"" drama, Don't waste your time on this hokum. Read Pepys section on the Fire in his Diary instead.",1490054400,,1056,4.8397790055248615
8727862,5,B013I9RTW6,Very enjoyable movie and I remember learning about it in our history lessons at school many years ago.  It made it more real to see the actual facts.,1482192000,,149,4.321428571428571
8727863,2,B013I9RTW6,"I did not enjoy this movie.  I expected a ""disaster' movie with a period flair, and after the first episode I had high expectations, the cast was good, the costumes were superb, and the stories that were set up seemed very interesting.  Unfortunately the remaining episodes took a strange turn.  Rather than focusing on the fire, the main thrust of the plot was about a plot to kill the king and the Spymaster's strange attraction or suspicion?  I'm still not sure, for/of the sister in law of the baker in whose house the fire started.  Rather than see the characters that were set up in episode one struggle to survive the disastrous fire, we see them struggle with spying, suspicion, false imprisonment, assassination, and adultery, the fire is merely a background plot which occasionally raises the stakes.  Frankly there was too much going on, and I found the motivations to be so paper thin that I just didn't care.  The only plot of any interest was King Charles and his brother, but this was hastily resolved. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1466467200,3,1049,4.762430939226519
8727864,5,B013I9RTW6,"British history furnishes many great dramas and the Great First of London certainly is worth studying in depth. The story, as told here, conflates some of the royal politics going on, but is still largely based on truth. I especially enjoyed seeing what Samuel Pepy's (he of the famous diary about the event) family life may have been. Like many historical dramas, it does have a subplot that is ""truthish"" but well done and perhaps likely to have happened (or something like it did happen). The fire did actually start in a bakery.",1465776000,2,532,4.731182795698925
