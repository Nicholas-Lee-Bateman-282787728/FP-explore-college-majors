7836437,2,6303079598,"""Pancho Barnes"" stars cute, sweet-as-pie Valerie Bertinelli, and that pretty much sums it up.  The ""real"" Pancho Barnes was a hell-raising, homely, tough-as-nails pilot.  So while Bertinelli is fun to watch the character she plays is very different from her namesake.  As a result this TV movie may have some appeal to viewers as a piece of entertainment, but in the end it is very disappointing.  It diverges wildly from Barnes' true-life story after the first 20 minutes or so, and becomes a schmaltzy fair tale.

7836439,4,6303079598,"Folks who know, or are seeking to know, Pancho Barnes history will be disappointed.  This is a prettied-up version of a tough story.  The modifications don't really hold together, making it not exactly biography, and not exactly quality fiction.

HOWEVER, it is great fun to watch Valerie Bertinelli in anything, which is why I bought the movie.  In that regard, I was not disappointed.  Valerie did some ugly movies in her career -- this isn't one of them.  That's the delightful thing!",1256860800,3,487,4.878048780487805
7836440,5,6303079598,"This movie is outstanding. Bertinelli did a great job in portraying Pancho. Often wish I had a copy for my library. Hope to see this in DVD format, soon!",1240617600,,153,4.310344827586207
