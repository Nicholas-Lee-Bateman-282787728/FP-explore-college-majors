8472347,5,B005GV6PYI,"My little movie group just watched this movie this past weekend.  Lawrence Tierney and Anne Jeffries had a lot of on-screen chemistry (they appeared together in ""Dillinger"" and ""Step by Step"") and they both look terrific in bathing suits!

In this movie they are a very attractive people who meet on the beach and find themselves having to prove they did not conspire to commit murder!  It's fun to watch as you get a real sense of what life was life immediately post WWII......even to this ex-Marine's murderous actions being attributed to his war experiences.  Interestingly, this ""B"" movie is NOT full of stock footage, but offers great glimpses of the Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu that only remotely resemble what they look like today.  The movie is well paced and very well acted.",1412121600,,789,4.858208955223881
