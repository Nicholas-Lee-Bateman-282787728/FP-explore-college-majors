The cinematography is fantastic and the locales in  Europe are beautiful.  The opening scene in Monaco alone would be worth the  cost of the movie.

851911,5,6304366086,"When I was growing up, I fantasized about being a Gran Prix driver. This film put me in that F1 Cockpit. I love the characters, the story lines, and drama. It was truly one of the most well rounded films I have ever seen.  Five Stars!",916617600,,234,4.086956521739131
852005,3,6304366086,"I love this movie - have since I first saw it 50 years ago in Cinerama.  I have both the DVD and the Blu-Ray (BTW they are identical aside from the picture resolution - the features and such are all the same) and the picture is beautiful and the sound fantastic.  Yea, the plot is rather hokey but that's beside the point - this is Formula 1 in all it's glory.  Some of the best auto-racing footage of all time, and plenty of cameos by the real F1 drivers of the day.  Also, I happen to think the mid 1960's cars were the best looking F1 cars ever (too bad they were deathtraps).
So, why only 3 stars?  Because it's pan-and-scan!  I thought it didn't look quite right first time a watched it, so I pulled out my old laser disc version.  The laser disc is 3.0 aspect - the DVD and Blu-Ray are 2.2 aspect ratio.  Unforgivable - over a quarter of the movie is cropped.  That's also why I bought the Blu-Ray when I already had the DVD - I figured they'd give me the entire movie on Blu-Ray, I thought wrong...",1511222400,8,1005,4.139175257731959

852118,5,6304366086,"Best auto racing movie ever, because John Frankenheimer was permitted to film racing scenes on all the grand prix courses in use during
the 1965 season (except for Watkins Glen in the USA). Also he was filming the actual  cars instead of being forced to splice in newsreel bits (luckily, digital did not exist then). It being a major commercial release, Grand Prix of course grafts on the usual backstage romantic complications, but these are actually OK considering the acting talent: Eva Maries Saint, James Garner, Jessica Walter, and British stage actor Brian Bedford. Garner even
looks like a real driver. Real fans who remember those days will also notice in the driver meeting scenes some actual drivers of that era. There will never be another film like this: because movie filming on track is no longer permitted by Formula 1 management.",1490400000,2,846,4.957746478873239

Yes, the plot gets a bit soapy at times, but the overall message at atmosphere have never been better captured...and are unlikely to be.

The filmmakers pulled out all the stops to capture the racing, no process shots or studio mockups with rear projection.
Enzo Ferrari was impressed enough with the production to allow filming in his factory. That should tell you all you need to know.

I am still blown away by this movie when I went through the special documentaries on the BR disc and learned: this movie was filmed as the actual races were being run,  James Garner and the two Italian actors did their own driving, and James Garner really did bail out of a crashed car suit on fire!  The actual drivers of the time (now legends in their own right) have cameos and small speaking parts; and this is perhaps the only tour of the actual Ferrari works and production line at that time.  That they used an actual Ford GT40 as the camera car and had cameras the size of suitcases mounted on the film race cars, unbelievable.  And the real cars filmed; not one advertisement on them, just the makers marks and the beauty of the styling to relish.  Truly a beautifully-made film (no cg or green screen) of the era of Camelot in Motorsports.  And Steve McQueen's remark to James Garner after he saw the film....Priceless!",1461369600,2,1005,4.376344086021505

852503,1,6304366086,"True, the technical prowess in filming the race sequences with the technology of the time, and footage of the historic racing machines from this classic era, is very impressive. Unfortunately the 1960's soap opera melodrama and writing - as well as the acting at times - spoils the film. Not to mention the military/martial music! ...what was JF thinking there?? To be brief, unless you are a fan of 1960's histrionics and mediocre acting - by folks who should have known better - this movie overall as a whole, as a movie (ie w/ plot, beginning, middle, and end) is absolutely terrible. My main gripe with this movie is that it's supposed be about something; ie supposed to have a story to it, about Grand Prix racing, beyond F1 cars whizzing around a track to the tune of a military band playing; not to mention confusing /irrelevant split screen work interspersed here and there. Which gets to the crux of it. Frankenheimer was a great director and produced some great work. But with ""Grand Prix""  JF  was either disinterested or believed the storyline was somehow subservient to the technical achievement. In my opinion this would be a great classic F1 race movie if the footage had been cut down to the race scenes only, and rest of the baloney - including the martial  music - were left out. NB: Garner is cast as a somewhat oafish American, a role which suited him very well, better than most others he played!

852655,4,6304366086,"""Grand Prix"" may be an older film now but it still is a pretty good film.  I liked a lot of the different shots the camera uses in the movie but felt it dragged in a few places.  The movie is 249 minutes long that's over 3 hours so it is more like an epic drama piece.  But the film definitely has the racing scenes to back up the name.  I felt the film could have used more editing on some of those scenes and could easily have dropped 20 to 30 minutes off the film without hurting the story.

Overall thought the film was very good and worth watching.  What I really enjoyed about the film was how the film accurately shows how difficult it really is to race at that high level of speed consistently rowing through the gears and making all the hairpin corners without crashing.  No mindless blockhead sitting on the couch could hop into an F1 car and compete like these professional drivers.

The film follows several different drivers' lives on the World Circuit of Formula 1 in 1966.  There are a couple of romances in the film.  James Garner is the lead actor portraying the hero character Peter Aron he is believable as a veteran race driver although a little tall for the role.  His chief rival on the track is Jean- Pierre Sarti played by Yves Montand who drives a high powered Ferrari.  It is clear in the film that Ferrari had the superior cars on the tracks and that BRM Lotus and the Japanese were all trying to catch up.

I always think of most racecar drivers between 5'7"" to 6"" at the most because of how compact the cars are.  Not to say that taller people can't drive race cars by no means, but looking at those F1 cars you would not see many NBA players fitting into one of those.  I also tend to see race car drivers as a bit younger or as a young man's sport but maybe older drivers were the norm back in the 1960's proven drivers were probably given the reins to the car rather than risking all that money on young restless drivers more likely to crash.

The film really convenes that live for now mentality that most race car drivers seem to live by according to Hollywood.  James Garner actually did most of his own driving in the film which is really cool.  Similar to a lot of other leading men of that time period Steve Mcqueen, Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood were all renown car guys.  I would rate this film 4  to 5 stars and found it more exciting than Steve McQueen Le Mans.",1441756800,,2419,4.274725274725275

I don't care how old this movie is, the action sequences were excellently done, and I think the split screen was a real plus.  The races would go from a delicate almost kind of dance, to the close up roaring and pure muscle of the machines.

I thought James Garner's character was perhaps the most interesting.  He was a guy who was nothing without racing.  That was his life.  All the other drivers seemed to have something else outside racing.  Even the English driver needed to prove something about his brother.  But Garner was only about the racing.  And he was able to pull it off and make it interesting.  I really liked it.",1440028800,2,738,4.549618320610687

852862,4,6304366086,"At the risk of sounding repetitious and ultimately redundant, I'll say it again:  The better looking the original print, the better looking the Blu-ray transfer is going to be.  Warner Bros. restored MGM's 1966 Cinerama extravaganza ""Grand Prix"" from original 65 mm Super Panavision elements, and in high definition the result is some of the best-looking video for a live-action picture you'll find on any Blu-ray disc anywhere.

Even more to the point, ""Grand Prix"" is the best film ever made about car racing.  Too bad it isn't the best movie ever made about people.  Anyway, nobody--not Paul Newman, not Steve McQueen, not Tom Cruise--looked better behind the wheel of a car than ""Grand Prix"" star James Garner.

In this part-time race-car movie, part-time soap opera, Garner gets plenty of chances behind the wheel.  If only the movie had left him there and de-emphasized the various personal romances, this nearly three-hour epic might have come in at a more comfortable two hours and provided a lot more thrills for the buck.

A few years ago, Warner Bros. not only fully restored it but decked it out with a goodly assortment of new documentary material, which we get here.  But probably the best thing about owning the movie on disc is that after you've seen it once or twice, you can skip the scenes you don't like the next time you watch it.  ""Grand Prix"" is about Formula One racing, and that's where the action lies.

The film takes us into the public and personal lives of four fictional drivers vying for the world championship during an FIA Formula One World Championship racing season.  The principals are Pete Aron (James Garner), an American driving for BRM, a man who hasn't won a Grand Prix event since he left Ferrari three years earlier; Jean-Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand), a Frenchman, twice World Champion, now number one at Ferrari but beginning to question his chosen life; Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedford), Pete's teammate at BRM, a wealthy Englishman trying to live up to the reputation of his older brother, a world champion driver killed in a racing accident; and Nino Barlini (Antonio Sabato), Sarti's teammate at Ferrari, a young, devil-may-care Sicilian, former motorcycle racer, and full-time lover.

Behind the races we meet Louise Frederickson (Eva Maria Saint), an American journalist following the racing season for a fashion magazine, a woman who becomes involved with the married Sarti.  We also meet Pat Stoddard (Jessica Walter), Scott Stoddard's wife, who enjoys the high life and hates her husband's risking his life racing.  When a car wreck involving her husband's racing car and Pete's car puts her husband out of action, she takes the opportunity to leave him and take up with Pete.  And there are Izo Yamura (Toshiro Mifune), a rich Japanese industrialist with ambitions to field a racing team good enough to win the world championship; and Lise ""I don't smoke; I don't drink"" (Francoise Hardy), Nino's newest girlfriend.  For reasons unknown, Pete practically disappears from the movie's second half, at least up until the final race of the season, making even more room for the sudsy goings on of the other players.

Fortunately, if you can make it through all the ditzy relationships and romances, there are the racing sequences to enjoy, and they are most often dazzling.  Director John Frankenheimer, who gave us such films as ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" and ""Ronin,"" was a man who knew his action and suspense, if not his romance.  He uses a good number of multiple split screens right from the opening titles, a convention that became quite popular in the late 1960's and 70's but has thankfully fallen out of favor in the last few decades.  The director uses everything at this disposal to provide the visceral excitement of the racing events, from the aforementioned multiple screens to overheads and close-ups, plus plenty of corner camera setups and point-of-view shots.  In fact, it is the first-person cockpit shots that are most riveting.

The movie takes us all over Europe, with location shooting in Monaco, France, England, Belgium, etc., the photography beautiful in its scope and vision.  The filmmakers shoot the French Grand Prix particularly well, quite poetically, and they do up the Belgium Grand Prix mostly in the rain, making for some breathtaking shots.  Accompanying the action, we hear Maurice Jarre's sometimes lyrical, sometimes evocative, always stimulating musical score, much of it reminiscent of his work in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" with touches of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" thrown in.  I mean, you know this is an epic not only by its length but by its overture and its entr'acte music.

Racing veterans Phil Hill, Joakim Bonnier, and Richie Ginther acted as advisors on the film, with Carroll Shelby as technical consultant.  Additionally, the director got real-life Formula One drivers Graham Hill, Lorenzo Bandini, Bob Bondurant, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, and a host of others to participate in many of the scenes, lending a further note of authenticity to the proceedings.  Graham Hill, incidentally, was almost too good to be true, looking like a young David Niven.

Perhaps the movie's greatest achievement is in capturing the feeling of a bygone racing era, the end of an age in racing history where the competition was still a seat-of-your-pants undertaking, where racing machines were nothing more than engines on wheels, and where strict safety rules and million-dollar endorsements were dreams of the future.  Today's Formula-One machines are so technologically advanced, they look and behave like intergalactic, science-fi rocket ships compared to the racing cars of 1966.

But there are also the exaggerated emotions and personal matters to contend with, none of which in and of themselves would probably not happen to somebody in real-life but seem to happen to everyone in this picture simultaneously.  A horrendous accident nearly cripples Scott, but he determines to make it back to the track and become a world champion; everybody in the film has an affair with somebody else; the characters are generally vacuous stereotypes, Pete chief among them; team managers are ruthless; and winning is everything to every driver, every owner, and every spectator.  It begins to feel like piling on.

As with all sports movies, ""Grand Prix"" comes down to the final contest, in this case the final race of the season to determine the world championship, and the tension mounts.  Ah, the joys of movies on disc, to be able to watch the film again by clicking only on the racing sequences.  They are more than worth the price of the BD.

Video:
The job Warner Bros. did restoring the film from 65 mm elements and transferring it to high-definition HD DVD a few years ago impressed me greatly.  The Blu-ray results impress me no less, with WB now using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode to replace the previous VC-1.  What's more, the video engineers have again preserved the film's original 2.20:1 aspect ratio (originally projected, as I've said, on some screens in Cinerama).

Like the HD DVD that preceded it, the Blu-ray picture is exceptionally clean and vividly detailed.  Furthermore, the colors remain entirely natural, bright yet never too bright, certainly never dull, and as deep and rich as ever.  Moir effects and artifacts of any kind continue largely as nonissues; indeed, they're almost nonentities.  Grain is almost zero, too, except that which is inherent to the original print; motion effects, halos, and pixilation are nearly zero.  It is, in short, among the better pictures you'll find on Blu-ray disc.  Although the video is never actually startling in its clarity, it is impressive in its sense of realism.  As before, there are a few slightly dark faces; otherwise, the picture quality must be pretty close to what I imagine the original film print to look like.

Audio:
Using lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 this time out rather than the Dolby Digital Plus they used on the HD DVD, the audio engineers capture a wide front-channel stereo spread, along with a strong dynamic impact and good overall clarity.  Still, the rear channels communicate only a small amount of sound in things like engine noise, tires, crowds, and musical ambience, and voices can sometimes sound harsh and hollow.  However, the racing sequences continue to be the highlights of the movie, and it is here that the audio serves them well, if a little forward in the upper midrange.

Extras:
For the Blu-ray, Warners carry over the extras from the previous editions.  These include five featurettes and a theatrical trailer.  The first documentary, ""Pushing the Limit: The Making of Grand Prix,"" is twenty-eight minutes long and includes commentary from the filmmakers, stars, and drivers who worked on the film.  Interestingly, we learn that director Frankenheimer originally wanted Steve McQueen to play the part of Pete Aron, but it fell through; and the director insisted that his actors learn to drive race cars and that most of them do at least some of their own driving in the movie.  The second documentary, ""Flat Out:  Formula One in the Sixties,"" is seventeen minutes long and contains the reminiscences of a number of world-champion drivers about their racing experiences in the 1960s.  The third documentary, ""The Style and Sound of Speed,"" eleven minutes long, is all about the photography, sound, and editing of the film; and the fourth documentary, ""Brands Hatch: Chasing the Checkered Flag,"" ten minutes long, is a look at the British Grand Prix course today.  Then, there's a promo featurette, ""Grand Prix: Challenge of the Champions,"" twelve minutes, made at the time of the film's production.

The extras wrap up with forty-five scene selections; a theatrical trailer; a special promo; English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish spoken languages; French, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.  As usual with WB's latest Blu-ray discs, they package it in a flimsy Eco-case.

Parting Thoughts:
For anyone who enjoys motor racing, ""Grand Prix"" remains the best movie ever made about the subject.  Despite its histrionic interludes and melodramatic glimpses into the drivers' private lives, the racing sequences more than make up for the deficiencies.  In its Blu-ray transfer, it is a terrific motion picture just to look at, and if you don't like the mushy stuff in between the races, you can always use your remote's ""Fast Forward"" and ""Skip"" buttons.",1433376000,8,10595,5.084922010398613

852927,5,6304366086,"This a beautiful, exciting, riveting examination of Grand Prix racing, as told through the observations and intertwining personal lives of four professional Formula 1 drivers and their respective love interests. The romantic and philosophical interludes are mere reprieves from the exciting, heretofore unseen, technically majestic racing action camera work. Bear in mind, miniature cameras were not available in the sixties, and the engineering know-how and chutzpah required to strap a large analog camera to the front of a race car going 180 mph is truly awesome. Yves Montand is the most interesting character, with a complex triangular relationship between his wife, the lovely Eva Marie Saint, who is a welcome distraction from his troubled marriage, and his obsession with racing. Garner is fascinating as the vexed, displaced professional racer looking for a new drive, and finding a successful assignment with Toshiro Mifune's nascent racing company (the theatrical equivalent of Soichiro Honda's formidable Honda Motors). Brian Bedford is convincing as a world class racer recovering from a deadly crash, and simultaneously picking up the pieces of his broken relationship with his disapproving spouse, the captivating Jessica Walters. Antonio Sabto is believable and likable as a young, world champion motorcycle racer who has made the transition to Formula 1, although his ongoing squabbling with his beautiful girlfriend, Franoise Hardy, who we never really get to know, although we would like to, is an unnecessary distraction at best. As the movie progresses he continually receives better dialog and has a touching and tragic scene at the end, as he rolls into the Ferrari pits in utter and complete disbelief and despair. Many famous Formula 1 drivers of the day appear in the film including Jim Clark, Jack Brabham and many others, which lends an air of ""You are There"" realism. Many of them, such as Graham Hill, are not mere cameos, and actually participate in many dramatic scenes. The cars are the stars in this petrol head blockbuster, although you will find the attractive and talented supporting cast and subplots an interesting distraction. Many characters appear one-dimensional, although this may be due to heavy editing to reduce the film to a tolerable running time. One of the top film from the sixties, and Frankenheimer at his finest.",1429747200,5,2367,5.331550802139038

In the first sequence (the Monaco Grand Prix) the 3D-effects were so eye-popping they came with the same vertigo as a thrill ride. It put you in the driver's seat trying to steer, shift gears and use the pedals! If they had just stuck with this kind of movie and camera work it would have been much, much better, but there was somebody responsible for abruptly splitting the screen into 2 or 3 views and a experimental technique of multiple identical images in some shots that were terrible and even in the original Cinerama presentation I remember being irritated and just waiting for these effects to go away and return to the excellent camera work. This real-time action, captured at racing speed is enough to make up for those stylistic short-comings and what passed for drama, which was tired even then with bad dialogue and themes that seem to have been in every racing movie ever made. ""Grand Prix"" is still a terrific film of classic Formula 1 racing before it became the tek-show it is today. Real footage, not FX or CGI, that even without the original Cinerama projection still works to give you a taste of what it was like.

The movie is crisp, clear, and looks brand new, despite being 50 years old. The racing sequences are just mind-blowing, with the sweet sound of those engines unmarred by an overlaid music soundtrack. And the one-take point-of-view lap from Monte Carlo! It feels like you're in the car driving it. No crappy foley effects. No fakey CGI, rear projection, models, etc. The actors actually drove the cars. This is the real deal.

This is what movies should be.

853296,4,6304366086,"This is primarily a melodrama with extraordinary racing sequences. For fans of racing films this film is a must see movie! Even after all these years the racing sequences still hold up surprisingly well.

When this movie was still in production they showed the racing footage that had already been completed to Ferrari and they were so impressed by what they saw that they invited the the filmmakers to shoot inside the Ferrari racing factory (up until that time nobody--not even Sports Illustrated--had been allowed to photograph the inside of that building). Quite a compliment!

Steve McQueen was offered James Garners role first and turned it down thinking this was going to be just another Hollywood racing picture in which (like all that had preceded it) nothing bore any resemblance to the REAL racing world. Once the film came out and he had a chance to see it, he was heartbroken that he'd passed on it and in his frustration went on to make the practically ALL racing footage and less-plot-than-it-would-take-to-fill-a-thimble ""Le Mans"".

A bevy of top professional drivers were employed to train the actors so that they would look convincingly like real race car drivers while being filmed. James Garner was coached by Dan Gurney and had such an natural affinity for driving that by the time his sequences were filmed he was on a level with some of the drivers making a living at it professionally. Gurney said that if he was willing to do it full time he could have been one of the top drivers in the field.

As a movie itself, if you like melodrama you will more than likely be entertained. If you don't, but you love fantastic racing footage, this is one of the finest examples of that which you will ever be likely to find. If neither interests you, this may not be your cup of tea.",1413158400,5,1797,4.695238095238095
853297,5,6304366086,"50 years have not brought to the screen better photography.

The idea is intriguing enough.  The movie depicts a series of Formula One races, and we see many shots of cars racing, including the high speeds, the sharp turns, cars getting too close to one another and the consequences, accidents, breakdowns, and personal harm to the drivers.  The movie also covers the relationships of the drivers to each other and to their friends and families, and the strains that auto racing put on all involved, as well as the contentious relationships between racing drivers and their sponsors.

But the movie becomes long and tedious namely because it squeezes in too much.  As a result the movie becomes overlong, and you wish the picture could have been told more quickly and simply.",1406419200,,837,4.7379310344827585

  A well written script, well performed by a great cast round out this film enhancing the racing scenes instead of over powering them.

853938,3,6304366086,"Hard-luck American Pete Aron (James Garner) is fired for causing his teammate Scott Stoddard to crash into the Monaco harbor.  Failing to land a ride with Ferrari, Aron pursues a new career as racing commentator for a major TV network (presumabley ABC).  After one race, he quits as commentator in order to accepts a ride with an up-and-coming Japanese team.  While Stoddard mends in the hospital, his bored wife takes up with Aron who is winning races again.  Defending world champion Jean-Pierra Sarti, meanwhile, crashes but is not seriously hurt.  Trapped in a loveless marriage, Sarti begins seeing an American fashion writer.  Not to be outdone, his dashing and footloose Ferrari teammate Nino Barlini scores with a young, equally footloose French girl.  Stoddard recovers and wins three races to put himself back in contention for the championship.  The seasons concludes at the treacherous Monza Autodrome, with all four drivers sharing an equal shot at winning the Drivers' World Championship.  Who will win?  And what will become of their love affairs?  ""Grand Prix"" was a highly-touted, high-tech, big budget movie let down by a cheesy Hollywood script. Place the blame on director John Frankenheimer who nixed a terrific script by racing journalist Robert Daley. Said Daley: ""Frankenheimer's talent was to get the bloody thing done, to get the money, and get it done, and get it in the theaters.""  Judging by the rushed ending (a number of GP's are skipped over, including the U.S. GP), Daley's claim has merit.  Garner did his own stunt driving, and suffered burns to his neck from a stunt that went wrong.  Garner is convincing as enigmatic Pete Aron, but Shakespearean actor Brian Bedford is badly miscast as Scot Stoddard.  Yves Montand of France is convincing as the Juan Fangio type,  Toshiro Mifune of Japan is perfect as Yamura, and Italian heartthrob Antonio Sabato rounds out the international cast nicely.

Bottom line: Great racing scenes can't save a bad script.  Three stars.",1396396800,,2001,5.085889570552148

854010,3,6304366086,"""Grand Prix"" is a visual and exhilarating ride! Filmed in 1966 and directed by the talented John Frankenheimer of ""Manchurian Candidate"" fame, ""Grand Prix"" is a must see film about racing. I recently saw ""Grand Prix"" and was completely awestruck at the cinematography and brilliant direction. The film incorporates actual formula 1 racing and has famous drivers such as Jim Clark, Graham Hill and Juan Manuel Fangio making cameo appearances. The film begins with Aerial shots of the ""Circuit de Monaco"" and a camera mounted on the hood and back of a Ford GT40 driven by Championship driver Phil Hill, makes this an authentic film complete with heart stopping footage. The audience is immediately in the driver's seat as formula 1 kisses every curve through beautiful Monaco, France, and the famous Monza racetrack in Italy. The story follows four Formula 1 drivers: Pete Aron, played by James Garner trying to make a comeback, English driver Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedform) recovering from a car crash and strongly resembling famous race car driver Jim Clark, actor Yves Montand as the seasoned French driver Sarti who gets involved with American Journalist played by Eva Marie Saint and Italian newcomer race car driver Nino Barlini played by Antonio Sabato. The film runs a bit long on their personal stories. Romantic leading ladies in the story line include actress Jessica Walter and French singer, Franoise Hardy. Shot in Super Panavision 70, ""Grand Prix"" was presented in theaters in 70mm Cinerama (curved movie screens). The best part of this film is the direction and Formula 1 racing footage. ""Grand Prix"" won three Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects, and Best Film Editing. Frankenheimer, a real car racing enthusiast was nominated for Outstanding Director by the Director's Guild of America. Doing much of his own driving was James Garner, who after making the film took up racing. His skills on the set impressed formula 1 drivers Graham Hill and Jack Brabham to such a degree, they told him he could have been a successful Grand Prix driver had he not gone into acting.",1394841600,,2097,5.028735632183908

A camera mounted over the foot box shows some great heel-to-toe down shifting and one mounted next to the driver shows that the old ""H"" pattern gear boxes required pretty precise movement. The ""Extra Features"" on Disc 2 show how the film was made and what it was like to race open wheel cars during a dangerous era. For motor racing fans, a must have.",1394582400,,630,4.48695652173913

While the fudged a bit, using F3 cars to double as F1 (though if they had not told me that I may not have figured it out) The director made use of actual Formula 1 drivers and actual F1 courses to film the race scenes. Of course this was all well before the use of CGI was even thought off. What you see is what you get. A well written script with characters that you can really believe in and and some pretty terrific race scenes with the most interesting use of camera angles and split screen.

This BluRay process is truly amazing in that with its clarity it draws you in deeper into the film. Isn't that why we see films? To get so focused into the plot that we become an outside participant in the story? BluRay really helps with this transformation. The racing scenes are raucous and stunning all at once. John Frankenheimer is truly a cinematic genius the way he filmed the race sequences. He is the consummate film director knowing what people to hire to make this story into a racing film classic.

854278,4,6304366086,"Having just seen the new Ron Howard film, Rush, I thought I'd watch Grand Prix for a comparison.  Both films are excellent and well worth watching, but I have to say, I'd still give the nod to Grand Prix.

While Rush delved into a fascinating relationship between two real-life competitors who both hated and ostensibly needed each other, Grand Prix has the advantage of being filmed in 1966, the 60's being the golden age of Grand Prix.  The international flavor of the circuit was captured more vividly in Grand Prix, with the American driver teaming up with a Japanese car maker, portraits and motives of the international drivers fleshed out, as well as the glamour of jet-set touch-and-go hook-up romantic relationships.  Just as importantly, I thought Grand Prix did a much better job of portraying the actual experience of driving the track.  In Rush, the portrayal of driving is meager, leaps all over and becomes visually confusing, while Grand Prix actually focuses in to allow the viewer more of the terrifying and exhilerating experience of what it would be like to race.

Grand Prix has aged well, but perhaps it is ironically weakest in the characterization of its main character, portayed by James Garner.  His personality is the least developed, having little more depth than just the strong-and-silent macho American, a characterization perhaps better left to soldier movies.  Even when driving, he seemed to have a laconic, half-bored attitude, intensity sacrificed for a seeming expectation of innate American superiority.

Both Rush and Grand Prix are thrilling, expertly-rendered movies.  If you are going to see one, you must see the other.  Together they seem to round each other out for a satisfying portrait of the glamorous and dangerous sport of Grand Prix.",1380931200,,1784,5.096219931271477

854334,4,6304366086,"Grand Prix was groundbreaking when it was released in 1966. Director John Frankenheimer delivered a 70mm widescreen epic that roars with the engines of Formula 1 cars careening around the famous race courses of Europe to the accompaniment of a marvelous musical score by Maurice Jarre, perhaps best known for his music from Lawrence of Arabia. The real highlights of this film are Jarre's music, the visual effects by Saul Bass and the cinematography by Lionel Lindon. In an era before electronic manipulation was possible, Grand Prix has stunning visual effects that had to be created the hard way, optically. How good are the music, visual effects and cinematography? So good that an entire race can be shown without a word being spoken, because the sights and sounds say it all.

The story of the racers and their wives/lovers is a bit tedious, but likely required for commercial success. The storyline follows the exploits of American racer Pete Aron (James Garner), as he bounces from the Italian Ferrari team (before the film begins), to the British Jordan BRM, to the Japanese ""Yamura"" team in his quest for the Formula 1 driving championship. Cameos show about a dozen of the greatest names in Formula 1, and a few get some lines of dialogue.

Grand Prix was a Cinerama release, the biggest, widest, loudest of movie technologies, and was custom crafted for this purpose. Therefore, you really must have the restored Blu-ray release to get the full effect of this film's visuals, sound effects and music.

Occasionally you will see flashes of John Frankenheimer's brilliance in the racing sequences that would forshadow his later ""Ronin"" but the non-racing dialogue scenes could not help.

To my eyes ""Le Mans"" with Steve McQueen is the best racing movie to watch. Unlike Frankenheimer, who used Grand Prix as a backdrop for human ""drama"" (weak as it is in ""Grand Prix""); Steve Mcqueen had the race of Le Mans as the main focus.  The human drama was there, but Mcqueen used it as a seasoning for the movie,  not the main course.

854468,5,6304366086,"This film is a classic. I saw it as a kid when it came out, at a local theater and with the large screen, incredible audio, it was captivating. The cinematography is some of the best you will ever experience, the sound is overwhelming making you feel you are really present, and the acting is not stiff and unrealistic. James Garner actually drove his car , as did some others, which is quite fascinating. The work performed by the film crew at the many locations, showed their professionalism and attention for detail. The excitement, glamor and sheer and utter danger of racing those tiny cars during that period showed the audience everything they needed to know of the sport at that time.

The sport of F1 has certainly changed over the years since this film was made, and while it is safer for everyone involved, the action is even more intense with the cars being much faster and quicker on the tracks. And, about the only track used in the film which is still mostly as it was in the 1960's is Monaco.

It was certainly exciting seeing Richie Ginther, Graham Hill, Jim Clark, Phil Hill (no relation to Graham, who is Derek Hill's father, and Derek achieved what his dad did not: a World Driving Championship), Bruce McLaren, etc, in the film. In attesting to the dangers of the sport at that time, quite a few of the drivers seen in the film were killed within 5 or so years after this film was made. And, while many mfgrs. are still present (Lotus & Ferrari) today, so many teams folded due to the technology advancements made which were very costly. The sport today is not for the feint of heart nor the thin of the wallet, so to speak. Drivers make millions per year and are some of the best athletes in the world of sports due to their abilities to think quickly and sanely with heart rates of over 150 bpm at over 200 mph whilst enduring braking and cornering g-forces of over 5gs. If they crash into the safety barriers at 170mph, they survive the 9+gs of force. (I don't know how they avoid closed head injuries, though.)

If you have a chance, you also need to see _Senna_, about the legendary & tragic McLaren driver, Ayrton Senna.

Next up this year: _Rush_, by Ron Howard, on the Niki Lauda & James Hunt era. It could likely surpass _Grand Prix_ as the ultimate film of Formula One.",1369785600,,2300,4.469047619047619

854472,5,6304366086,"Firstly, although this movie is super-brilliant, unless you are interested in Formula 1 racing in the 1960's - with a running time of over 3 hours - Grand Prix could be a challenge.  For those of you who dig racing, well, let's just say that Grand Prix is to Formula 1 Racing as Lawrence of Arabia is to historical docu-dramas.  Grand Prix is an EPIC, and Director (a very young) John Frankenheimer's greatest work.  The acting, script, score, locations, and effects are all first rate, but the biggest attraction is the cinematography which created a new paradigm and certainly raised the bar for action camera work.  The film crew found new and innovative ways to strap, mold, bolt and angle 35mm cameras onto and around race cars.  There's no trick photography, when you see a shot from a race car going 185 mph around an embankment, it's real.  Quite frankly, there's nothing like it, even today.  Also, Frankenheimer implemented some very ""1960's"" stylistic touches, like split screen, multi screen, montage, etc. - you can clearly see where the cartoon SPEED RACER got all their ideas.  Well, if you've read this far, take the time to see the movie... there's a great story centered around Jim Garner who is a good hearted veteran racer making his comeback, both on and off the track, and of course his interaction with other racers and the ladies:)  And yes, the film is FUELED with high-octane HEMINGWAYESQUE bravado.

GP still has great racing footage, even with today's miniature video cameras inconspicuously attached to helmets and other parts of cars. The split screen(s) are kind of retro-looking now, but still quite exciting. Turn your volume up and step into the past.",1366934400,,563,4.804123711340206

This could not be filmed this way nowadays and I doubt they (The Studio's) would let the stars participate as much, as it would be considered to dangerous and expensive (Insurance) in this day and age! I read recently that this part was offered to his friend Steve McQueen first but he turned it down for some reason and suggested James Garner for the part which I hope is true but either way Mr Garner played a great part and deserved all the accolades that came from his part in this film.

The story begins in Monaco, on car cameras, beautiful camera shots (sometimes we see all four of the main racers in one shot). Plenty of advertising.  Pete and Scott get tangled up in a wreck, Scott is badly hurt and Pete loses his ride.  Pete goes to Ferrari for a car and is declined so he has to be a reporter. Meanwhile the veteran aspires for a gal and Pete hooks up with Scott's wife, seems girl chasin' is like racin'.

A car owner from Japan decides to enter a 3rd car and asks Pete if he wants to drive. With the drivers wearing helemets it is not always easy to tell who is who, like a football movie. The engine sounds are good.

Scott heals enough to race but has to take meds which leaves him drowsy. Their season is followed and the announcer explains the situations.

854519,5,6304366086,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1966 in the Cenerama Theater in St. Louis.  I like and value the movie so highly that I hesitate to use the tired old phrases to rave about it.  It is so rich in quality in every judgement area that it appears to me that this was a movie made to be the best it could be without consideration for difficulty or cost - quality in every way was all that would be acceptable.  The richness of the color and the crispness of image in the photography at the actual Grand Prix race courses of the world is beyond compare.  The casting of characters and their emersion into the roles to play out their individual but blended stories is perfect.  Of course I knew James Garner as a favorite actor but I became aware of Yves Montand through his great performance for the first time. The story has depth and is developed fully.  Top Grand Prix racers of that time make small acting appearances in the film - Phil Hill (American) and Graham Hill (English) for example.  The theme song is sublime.

Now approaching 50 years later I fly my RV-6A airplane that my wife Jeanine and I built in our garage before I retired, in Sport Air Racing League cross country air races across the US at over 200 miles per hour.  I watch this movie and ""The Worlds Fastest Indian"" at least once before the start of each season.  I have bought many copies of both DVDs and the Mystic Moods CD album ""More than Music"" containing the Grand Prix theme and given them to my younger racing friends to share this great experience.

Yes, I like the movie.

If you own a high def TV and a Blu-ray player this is one old movie worth the upgrade, the quality of the original film really comes through. I have tried going to Blu-ray on a few other older films like Le Mans and seen only marginal improvement, but this one really made a difference. I believe it has a lot the do with the 70mm Panovision cameras that were used to shoot this film. They were the cutting edge camera of their time, and the quality of the image really cannot be appreciated until you see it in high def.

854523,5,6304366086,"Director John Frankenheimer's most ambitious film captures what Formula I racing was in the mid-1960s.  Evident from the reviews here at Amazon it is a treasured film.  When this film premiered at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome, it was a sensation starting with its Oscar winning titles and cinematography.  It was shot entirely on location - filmed in luscious 70mm and presented with multi-track audio.  The composite imagery scattered throughout the movie gives it an art film feel - an art film that is thrilling.  It is still thrilling, dramatic and (frankly) melodramatic.  Frankenheimer's intent was to make a quality racing film that had broad appeal for general audiences and it worked.  (Much later, Frankenheimer would utilize what he learned making Grand Prix and apply it his excellent noir-thriller, Ronin.)  Grand Prix is a racing film made by a superb filmmaker.

Note: As popular as Grand Prix was (and remains), just 4-years later it was topped by actor Steve McQueen's equally ambitious Le Mans.  Spend some time working with professional racing drivers and crews as I have and you learn that most of them consider Grand Prix to be a ""soap opera with wheels.""  Steve McQueen's other career was racing.  For his film, McQueen chose to feature the ""race of races"" - the annual 24-hour 220+ mph endurance spectacle held in Le Mans, France.  As a result, Le Mans (1970) is the film that professional drivers value for its fairly accurate portrayal of GT Motorsport.

Story of 4 drivers battling through a formula one season. The young, dumb upstart; the weary legend at the end of his career (Jean-Pierre), the American, Pete, on his come back trail with Yamura (aka Honda), and Scott, the British driver who is injured. Also follows 3 of the women who love them, including Eva Marie Saint. Also stars a very handsome Toshiro Mifune as the head of Yamura, and an iron willed Ferrari boss.. Touches on many issues with surprisingly progressiveness, like Toshiro having killed 17 Americans in WWII.

The most important thing about this movie is the technicals. The on board cameras of F1 cars driving at speed is still viscerally beautiful, and a film buff will appreciate how hard it all was and that the same techniques were applied in RONIN decades later (same director: John Frankenheimer). Mounted cameras that pan and rotate (for the banks of Monza), the sound, the helicopter shots. The trailer shows what it will look like; if you don't get a thrill, you won't enjoy the movie.

I'm glad to see they put this on DVD. I've got a 65"" HDTV and surround sound, so it's very much like being in a theater. Turn out the lights, turn up the sound and immerse yourself in the world of racing when it was dangerous and thrilling.

Look carefully at what the driver's wear. In some states it's not legal to let your kid ride a bike wearing less than what they wore! They were a different breed back then, which makes it really cool that most of the drivers are the REAL ones---only the four main stars are actors. They they had to actually drive. They spent months learning how to drive Formula One. Those close-ups are real, on the track, at speed. No blue screen, no dollies under the cars. James Garner was really out there on those tracks at those speeds. They took the entire season to film it all.

And for you younger folks, they had never heard of CGI back then. So, when you see a car shoot through the air in a spectacular crash, it was a real car! They built a cannon that could shoot a Formula One car and then actually shot cars out of it as they filmed. The cars don't explode and blast 50 feet straight up like they do in today's over-blown FX, but this is how real cars crash.

There are 3 bravura racing sequences in this film, with some amazing angles and impressive cinematography.  But the rest of it is mediocre at best.  It's unfortunate that director Frankenheimer (who has made some outstanding films) didn't spend as much time on the script as he did figuring out how to mount cameras on the Formula 1 cars.  The characters are flat, and the cast is unable to breathe life into them.  The soap opera situations are laughable, and it's impossible to root for anyone.  The score is abysmal: Maurice Jarre recycles phrases and orchestrations from Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia; he basically composed one theme which is played to death in several variations.  The sound mix on the Blu-Ray is a mess -- the levels jump all over the place.  Finally, the movie is full of 1960s gimmicky split screens and optical effects which completely take you out of the film -- it's Michael Bay, 1960s style. Grand Prix was an ""event film"" in 1966, and it's like so many other event films: bloated, noisy, and soulless.  This one doesn't even have an A-list cast.

As others have noted, the film authentically captures Formula One racing in its heyday, before safety concerns and commercialization transformed the sport.  There's not another director in my book who has such a strong kinetic feel than John Frankenheimer.  The composition, editing, sound,  and use of split screens are all used effectively to convey the experience of both drivers and fans.  Though I'm not a knowledgeable race fun, it must be said that the design of mid-60s Formula One cars were gorgeous--elegant in their simplicity, with strong, clean lines.  In fact, a highlight for me was the 1960s aesthetic style on strong display in this film, from  go-go dancing and high fashion to interior shots during the various sub-plots.  Though the film's interpersonal melodramas function to highlight the psychology of the drivers---the film fails in this regard.  The racing scenes really function as a series of autonomous thrills, and don't carry with them the added emotional intensity of the private dramas.

854936,5,6304366086,"I saw this when it came out and remembered scenes from with complete clarity, somuchso that I would think of it often as I grew up.  These were the perceptions of a kid - of crashes, of infidelities in troubled marriages, of unscrupulous bosses, of the rise of Japanese industrialists, of untimely death - peering into adult life.  In a way, I was scared that I wouldn't like it today, but I wanted to watch it with my son as my dad did with me.  Happily, it was almost completely satisfying as an adult.

I think the most important characters in the film are, in a way, the race cars of the mid60s.  You get wonderful details about how they function, how they are designed, what their limits are, etc.  Of course, the men who create them are present, but they are mainly seen as businessmen of extraordinarily aggressive will to win at any cost, even the lives of their drivers.  Then, there are the drivers, who are the true lifeblood of the story, and their women.  My favorite is Yves Montand, a man of great talent and wisdom in a stalled marriage and burning out as a human being.  His team mate is an insensitive egoist from Sicily, an up-and-comer, who seduces a stupid groupie, the astonishingly beautiful Francoise Hardy in her prime.  Garner is excellent as a striver entering middle age, perhaps blowing his last chance.  He is seduced by the estranged wife of his old partner, who blames him for the terrible accident that maims him for life.  Toshiro Mifune is outstanding as a Japanese industrialist who wants to overcome the unchampion-like psychology of his Japanese drivers, employing subtle manipulation to do so.  Jessica (Play Misty4me) Walter, the estranged wife, delivered a performance so superior to Saint's that I was stunned.  Hardy made a great bombshell bimbo, to mirror the shallowness of her rock star boyfriend.  Brian Bedford, the wounded and implacably ambitious driver also develops a great character, complete with a pushy aristocratic mother that wants him to return and win, even if it costs him his life.

The plot follows these characters and their career concerns through the grand prix circuit for world championship.  It is so exciting that it made me a racing fan for many years, and intertwines well with the lives and conflicts of the drivers at a time when the sport was raw and largely undiscovered and the cars far more artisanal than today's high tech masterpieces that are converging on a single design.  There is no other film that portrays this kind of danger and excitement in such vivid images, complete with the inner dialogues of the drivers as they explain what they are facing.  It is absolutely masterful.

Nonetheless, the film isn't perfect.  I was surprised at how wooden Eva Marie Saint's performance was, really a walkthrough role of a character that she didn't bother to develop.  Her dialogue with Montand is stilted and formulaic.  Some of the effects are clearly dated, with flying dummies and models, though it is rare to notice them.

The bluray print is really worth it, though I had my worries after some of the lousy prints I've seen of older films.  They did a first rate transfer of this, evidently superior to dvd versions.  Finally, the extras documentaries are interesting, if a bit much.

855009,5,6304366086,"This is the first Blu-ray copy of an original 70mm film that I reviewed, and is at least one case where marketing hype couldn't oversell the image quality.  Sitting up close to a Samsung 52"" LCD screen, the images are so lifelike, you forget you're watching a movie.  I love the Ferrari pit crew; they actually have real mechanic's grime under their fingernails, not the phony baloney Hollywood grime usually present.  Even after watching the movie repeatedly, and deliberately looking to find fault with the copy, there was little to pick at.  Only a few scenes show a hint of smear around moving objects, which are so prevalent in lesser productions.  The recording engineers went to great lengths to assure the correct engine recordings and shift points were laid down on the final sound track.  The results are amazing.  Close ups of the driver's feet during a ballet like heel-toe shift had my hair standing on end, and during the race scenes, I find myself leaning to counteract the cornering forces.  Like other reviewers have noted, it is interesting to watch extras in the background, now that they don't fade into anonymous blurs.  It is also very refreshing to have extended scenes of the race that allow the viewer to actually focus on the moment and ride with the various drivers, unlike the obnoxious one second scene changes prevalent in today's action movies.  If you are a race buff or a car guy, you'll fall in love with this film.  The cars being raced represent the pinnacle of human engineering, before mega F1 budgets and computer assisted designs besmirched the gorgeous body work with hundreds of sponsor's logos and turned a handmade work of art into a perfectly manufactured technology exhibit.

855012,3,6304366086,"One of the big complaints leveled against films like Transformers and Cowboys & Aliens is that so much intelligence and artistry goes into programming the computers that spit out the CG images, none appears to be left for the script. The result, many critics say, is that we're left with compelling special effects sequences attached to a lot of bad dialogue and clunky plots. Not like in the good old days when Hollywood cared about plot, character and dialogue, right? Uh, no.

In the pre-Star Wars days the word studios and filmmakers used instead of CGI or special effects was ""spectacle."" And spectacle meant you were going to get hordes of extras, exotic locales, and big, long, complicated action sequences. Lawrence of Arabia is probably the definitive spectacle film in the same way that Avatar is the ultimate (for now) special effects film. Grand Prix was one of the big spectacle films of its time.

I have only previously seen Grand Prix on TV, and that was in b&w and over twenty years ago. After just seeing it on DVD on a big screen I'd have to say it counts as the Transformers of its day. The spectacle part is truly spectacular. The story follows four different drivers over the course of one Formula One season, and along the way John Frankenheimer, the director, stages four races that are definitive in their excellence. If you set out today to film a Formula One race, even using all the latest technology, it's impossible to imagine doing a better job than Frankenheimer did. The pacing, the camerawork, the editing, it's all perfect.

But now we come to the other half of the equation: that part of the script that's not devoted to vroom-vroom. It's godawful. Away from the track our drivers, played by James Garner, Yves Montand, Brian Bedford, and Antonio Sabato, find themselves in romantic entanglements with three women, played by Jessica Walter, Eva Marie Saint and Francoise Hardy. Note the disparity in numbers. This is because Garner and Bedford find themselves fighting for the affections of Jessica Walter. Each romantic sub-plot is worse than the next, and they go on and on and on. Montand and Eva Marie Saint have the dullest extramarital affair in history, and Sabato and Hardy, neither of whom appear to speak English, have a romance that feels like a role-playing exercise in an ESL class.

Not only is the romantic stuff rancid, it's not even filmed with any technical competence. Some of the interior sequences are harshly lit, and camera shadows are plainly visible in more than a few shots. I strongly suspect that Frankenheimer, exhausted or otherwise occupied by planning the race sequences, handed off these scenes to a second unit director. At least I'd like to believe that, because Frankenheimer was normally just as good at directing non-action sequences. So next time you hear someone say that CGI is killing storytelling, bear in mind that Hollywood has always sacrificed story for spectacle. Most of the toga epics of the 1950s and early '60s (think Cleopatra, Ben-Hur) were just as empty-headed and spectacular as The Green Lantern or Battle Los Angeles.

855015,4,6304366086,"""When I look back, I don't know how the hell we ever did that film."" - John Frankenheimer

At 176 minutes, Grand Prix is the very definition of epic, but is so perfectly edited and shot that it never really feels that length. I'm always weary of movies with bloated running times, but Grand Prix even features the 5-minute intermission as seen in theatres, so there's no reason to feel guilty for getting up and stretching your legs a bit.

The film follows four Formula 1 drivers as they question life, chase women, and face a crisis of confidence. It's very Day-of-Thunder-ish, but I guess there's only so much story you can shoehorn in-between racing scenes in a film like this. The documentary feel adds an authentic edge to it, which helps keep a far distance from Tony Scott's similarly-themed disaster.

Shot in 70mm and originally projected in Cinerama (a curved screen for an immersive experience, an early form of IMAX in a way), John Frankenheimer does not hold back and thrusts the audience right into the middle of real races. Up until this point racing movies were mostly b-grade drive-in material with actors shot against a projected backdrop (think of Clark Gable in To Please a Lady) and audiences had never really seen it for real, in color, and especially not from the driver's point-of-view. Some shots are mesmerizing, especially the camera, one inch above the surface of the tarmac, hurtling down the road. Few movies have ever given you this sense of speed. And it's all done for real. I'm not saying that there's no place for CGI in movies, but if you want something to look good, you're going to have to do it the hard way.

Grand Prix deservedly won three Oscars for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Film Editing. It will never win awards or recognition for the story, but for sheer sight and sound it's a force to be reckoned with.

The Blu Ray presents the film in brilliant 2.20:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras. The footage of Frankenheimer is all retrospective, and there's not nearly enough of him.

855017,5,6304366086,"If you like fast cars and the roaring sound of ""VAROOOOM!"" this is the movie for you. Or if you prefer soap opera romances and beautiful clothes, you, too, will like this movie. It opens with a bang on the picturesque streets of Monte Carlo, as the 1966 Grand Prix racers are bolting through town. We meet drivers from America, England, and France (James Garner, Brian Bedford, and Yves Montand) and follow their rivalry through the racing season. We also look behind the scenes at their love lives as they deal with conflicting feelings about racing.

This is an exciting and very enjoyable movie. Yves Montand never looked hunkier, even though he plays the oldest racer on the circuit. He's dreamy and so much better than his love interest, Eva Marie Saint, who is drab and dull and totally miscast as a fashionista. Brian Bedford, with his cute babyface and stiff-upper-lip is memorable as a sensitive driver who never quite lived up to his famous brother. His love is well-played by kittenish Jessica Walter as a model with a roaming eye. On the down side, handsome James Garner isn't given much to do and his character is bland and uninspired. Many real Formula 1 drivers have minor parts and several  Grand Prix races were filmed in various countries adding an authentic flavor.

The film comes in two discs and the Extras are quite interesting, featuring interviews with director and cast that were filmed in the nineties. We learn that the stars didn't use stunt drivers, but actually drove at high speeds for close-ups. The special effects are impressive, done decades before CGI. Maurice Jarre's soundtrack is lovely (and sounds a lot like his ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and even a bit like ""Dr. Zhivago"").

This is a movie with something for everyone - high speed racing excitement, romance, and quiet, dramatic moments. The acting and direction are excellent. Highly recommended.",1306454400,4,1885,4.899686520376176

This film is the most incredible visual experience you can ever imagine!  The racing scenes around Monaco at the begining of the film makes the best  Hollywood car chases look like a family drive to Sunday church.  One advantage they have over Hollywood car chases is that they can have a cameras located on the front of the car so you really get a feeling of speed. They can sustain the forward looking view for several minutes (entire laps) to give you the sense you are in the driver seat.  It is almost liked being in a roller coaster ride. A continous front camera views are much  harder to do in Hollywood films as they can only film in very short takes!

Amazingly innovative direction with very bold clever camera angles and special effects.

An intelligent plot and a charming love story between two intelligent people binds the film togeather.

855146,5,6304366086,"If you're a vintage racing fan, Grand Prix needs no review: it's a remarkable document of the golden age of racing, made at a time when the real cars -- and drivers -- were available. Phil Hill's recent passing reminded us of what we've lost.

If you're a film enthusiast, and maybe not so knowledgeable about 1960s Formula One, Frankenheimer's work still delivers. The cinematography is superb, and the script provides a fascinating look into the social scene and competitive aspects of racing back then. It's educational, without the burden of being a documentary, and apart from the overture and intermission segments it's easy to forget you're watching a 1966 movie. And it has a bit of substance: 1960s racers risked their lives in every race, much more so than F1 drivers do today in their much more elaborate cars. The spectre of death, and the sense that some onlookers might be there for the carnage, weighed on at least some of the drivers who were there for the sport. Grand Prix acknowledges this.

Grand Prix may be the best racing movie ever made. McQueen's LeMans in 1971 (he was originally supposed to be in Grand Prix) is a cult classic for diehard race fans, but almost devoid of plot or dialogue. I'm a big fan but would hesitate to recommend to anyone who isn't a gearhead. Grand Prix, on the other hand, should be very enjoyable to almost anyone with an appreciation of the era.

The extras included in the two-DVD set are also very good, and you can watch them prior to the film if you're among those whose knowledge of Formula One is minimal.",1229385600,,1565,4.64259927797834

And I doubt one like it can ever be made again because this was done in the real world and, now, everyone (directors etc) will want to do one using computer graphics and it will not have the same feel of realism.[""Driven"" with Stallone would be a good example of this] Also, I doubt, due to safety concerns/insurance etc, that one can be made this way again.

The ""How the Movie was Made"" is worth a huge chunk of the selling price.
The quality of the DVD is a great improvement, especially on an HD TV, over the VHS copy I've owned for some time.

The reason I say ""Grand Prix"" is the best is that ""LeMans"" lacks a strong story line or its story line pales next to the action, whereas ""Grand Prix""s story hangs in there fairly well.  However, one can argue ""LeMans"" has just as good race photography and, again, I doubt if a movie like it can be made now.

""Grand Prix"" has an excellent cast of very well known (at the time) actors from the U.S. and Europe. The photography of Europe is great as are the race scenes. There is romance involved to keep the story line going on something other than race after race. There is some tear jerker moments for the sentimental.

Speaking of story lines, I remember when ""LeMans"" came out that one of the NBC ""Today Show"" film critics, Judith Crist, lambasted the movie and said words to the effect that ""McQueen should have shot it on 8mm and shown it as home movies"". She's also the critic who said that ""Candy"" would set back pornography a 100 years. :)

As for story lines, another decent effort at a race movie is ""Winning"" with Paul Newman and his wife. A product of its day, the film tries pretty hard to combine a decent story with racing. Along with racing there are cheating wives, just the thing to spice up a race movie.
I would guess this is where PN picked up his love of racing which lasted 30+ years. His co-star is his wife.

And, last and least, is ""Red Line 7000"" which, when it came out, was a pretty cool drive-in movie and still stands up as a bit of kitsch of the time. The race descriptions by the ""on track"" announcer are guite funny but where else are you going to see a guy driving a Shelby Daytona Coupe around on the street? Besides, its one of James Caan's first roles, if not the first. Oh, and the ""on track announcer"" in ""Winning"" might be of the same cloth if memory serves.

One reason I probably have a soft spot for these movies is that they came out about the time I was a young Sports Car Club of America racer myself.
My new wife and I were really into this stuff. We drove 200 miles round trip one weekday night in order to see ""LeMans"" several weeks earlier than what would have been the case if we hadn't, due to where we lived.

I've recently purchased ""Winning"", ""LeMans"" and ""Grand Prix"" to donate to my small town library, spreading the joy of racing. Thanks to AMAZON, I can afford to do it.",1208563200,,2926,4.2671480144404335

Utilizing footage from 1966 F1 season, with in-car - driven by Phil Hill - camera-footage from several events and appearances by Graham Hill, Jim Clark, Juan-Manuel Fangio and Jack Brabham, there is a documentary feel to every race sequence.

855335,5,6304366086,"I had the pleasure of watching this in the theater when first released back in 1966. As a 9 year-old, my friends and I went just for the racing footage, nothing more. To us, the story-line was secondary. So for years after we would talk about it in those terms until the film faded to the back pages of memory. At 176 minutes, it never really got any air time on television, and if it had it would have been butchered beyond recognition. So finding the 40th Anniversary, 2-disc Special Edition, I immediately bought it and took it home to watch. What an utter joy this film is, on SO many levels.

Grand Prix is a story of triumph and tragedy on the mid-1960's Formula One circuit. James Garner plays Pete Aron, an American racer and ex-Grand Prix champion who, because of his over aggressive style, has been relegated to second driver on the British team. The movie starts off and immediately grabs your attention as we are thrust into the Grand Prix of Monaco. The first 20 minutes are as exciting and breath-taking as any film I have ever watched. Due to Aron's over-aggressiveness, the number one driver British driver, Scott Stoddard (Played by Brian Bedford) is almost killed in a horrific crash. The team fires Aron and he ends up being a television reporter for the next couple of races. He is ""rescued"" from that drudgery by the fledging Yamura team and is back in the race. What follows is absolutely the best racing footage ever filmed. Rounding out the exception cast is Yves Montand (Ferrari driver Sarti), Eva Marie Saint (a magazine reporter who falls in love with the married Sarti), Tishiro Mifune (Owner of Team Yamura), and in cameos, a host of 1960's Formula One drivers (Jimmy Clark, Graham Hill, Dan Gurney, and Bruce McLaren, to name a few).

Although the non-racing storyline has a bit of a soap opera-ish feel to it, Aron having an affair with Stoddard's estranged wife (Jessica Walters), Sarti having an affair with the reporter, and the other Ferrari driver having an affair with one of the racing groupies, it all works. All the mixing & matching relationships help build tenseness on and off the race course. When the crippled Stoddard returns to racing beyond all odds, the tenseness becomes extreme. What makes the plot works is the character development of all main parts. Each person has their demons to overcome, and because of the length of the film, director John Frankenheimer is able to explore those demons well.

The special features include a great documentary ""Pushing the limit: The making of Grand Prix"" which makes the extra price well worth it. It is very detailed and includes interviews with Garner & Frankenheimer. Also we're treated to a short film about Formula One racing in the sixties, which will always be my favorite period.

I would HIGHLY recommend this film to any racing buff as well as someone looking for a strong, plot-driven film. Yes, it's almost 3 hours long but it doesn't seem like it.",1201996800,3,2953,4.728155339805825
855336,5,6304366086,"This film is a dramatic snapshot of a bygone age, formula 1 at its rawest, these were the days before corporate sponsorships, car or track safety, when the death of a driver and to a lesser extent a spectator was almost accepted as part of the scene. There are no run off zones, tyre walls or armco here, just the occasional hay bale and serried ranks of telegraph poles. Set at a time when a driver could literally make their own car, bolt on an engine and have a realistic chance of winning. The story follows four disparate drivers as they compete for the championship, the stars as played by the actors are not too loosely based on real characters in F1 and the supporting cast is the real thing and as such may be forgiven the odd wooden line delivery. Graham Hill was a superlative driver, acting however clearly wasn't his forte.
The plot has been described as ""soapy"" and to an extent this is true in that it follows believable characters interacting in the arena of their choice. It's plausible, there are no conspiracies or villains (unlike the current F1 scene) to detract from the real stars and they're all four wheeled. The races are stunningly filmed without histrionics and the pre CGI nature of the film only enhances the excitement. People can tell the difference, reality is thrilling and computer generated fakery usually disappoints. This is the real deal and if racing cars are your thing, it's easily the best of its genre and shouldn't be missed.

855393,5,6304366086,"Forty years on, Grand Prix is still the best motor racing film ever made. The cars may be faster now, filming techniques improved and special effects more advanced, yet the film still has a truly epic scale and a feeling of veracity down to the last gear change that would be impossible to duplicate today. It feels real because much of it is real, the actors (with the exception of Brian Bedford) doing much of the driving themselves, with the production even entering cars in real races to seamlessly match footage. The real danger is only underlined by the fact that so many of the professional drivers in the film died racing themselves (ten in the decade following the filming alone). The crashes are there, along with the knowledge that that's what many in the crowd come for, but more than that, each race has a different character: more than just a different look, they're almost tone poems at times, one race from the driver's seat, another from a spectator's, another almost inside a character's head. Yet throughout, unlike later films, you always have a clear idea of what is going on and what point the race scenes are trying to make. The sequences have clearly been thought through and designed both emotionally as well as visually, with the great use of long lenses to establish scale and speed as cars drift in and out of focus giving the film a feel at once realistic and almost dreamlike (an impression further heightened in Saul Bass' almost balletic split-screen sequence). It's still a remarkably good looking film, too, not least because it was made at a time when the cars still looked like bullets rather than vacuum cleaners.

The plot itself may be simply a globe-trotting star-studded soap opera at heart - the roadshow equivalent of a doorstop bestseller - but it's a more than serviceable framework to hang the racing scenes on: after a spectacular crash in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix that cripples team mate Brian Bedford, James Garner's Formula One tries to work his way back on the circuit by racing for Toshiro Mifune's fledgling team while having an affair with Bedford's wife Jessica Walter. But while top-billed Garner may be the nominal and not particularly sympathetic lead, it's Yves Montand's ageing champion gradually realizing the absurdity of what he does but unable to quit who makes the greatest impression: so much so that when Garner disappears for much of the last third of the movie you barely miss him. Yet the cars remain the real stars, thanks to John Frankenheimer's constantly imaginative direction and his obvious enthusiasm for the material without ever losing himself in the minutiae as Steve McQueen did with Le Mans.

The film used every 65mm SuperPanavision camera then in existence, and thankfully the widescreen DVD transfer is a considerable improvement over the TV prints. Although it hasn't restored Mifune's voice, which was reportedly in the version shown at the film's premiere but subsequently replaced by Paul Frees on all prints (Adolfo Celi is also very obviously dubbed, possibly by Maximilian Schell), it does boast a good array of featurettes covering the making of the film and the Overture and Entr'acte from Maurice Jarre's excellent score have been retained.",1196812800,2,3237,4.937614678899083

If you ever saw the chopped up Ford GT-40 race car driven by Bob Bondurant that did much of the car-to car shots carrying a monster film camera and a maze of rigging and look at the on-screen result, it's truly amazing.

This can never be done again in modern times. Can you imagine anybody allowing or wanting a camera (a big cinema one) strapped to a modern F1 car DURING the race?.

855495,5,6304366086,"The characters are not fully developed and the plot is pretty simple, but this movie is about Grand Prix racing itself.  In that sense, the movie does a superb job of providing the look and feel of Grand Prix driving. The characters and plot are merely a framework to introduce the public to Grand Prix racing, and ""hollywood"" dramatics are kept to a minimum.

In many scenes, 1966 film technology was used to place you in the cockpit at 130 mph.  The quality of this 1966 version of virtual reality surpasses the effect achieved by placing minicams inside modern racing cars.  Most minicams record scenes of race cars negotiating a repetitive oval track.  In ""Grand Prix"", you are liable to loose your orientation when a camera car rounds a hairpin at Monaco at about 45 mph.  The whole picture becomes an abstract swirl of smeared shapes.  Never again will you see yourself racing down a straight away with unprotected spectators blurring passed you at 130 mph as they stand just 15-20 yards from the road.  Safety was atrocious in 1966.  In other scenes, the movie becomes an art film where racing scenes are montaged into overlaping and blended images that keep time with classical music selections.

The characters and the plot never over-power the movie.  They do provide breaks from watching too much racing, and the characters portray the motivations of the drivers, the owners, and the significant others who are affected by such a dangerous sport.  Several real Grand Prix champions have minor parts in the movie, which lends some additional interest.  It is a little eerie to see a movie about race car drivers where real race car drivers sort of drift in and around the actors during the ""people"" scenes.

Character, plot, 1966 virtual reality, and film artistry blend perfectly to provide an exciting, entertaining, and virtually flawless film about racing in the 1966 Grand Prix season",1173312000,3,1899,4.89375
855496,5,6304366086,"I had never seen ""Gran Prix"" until yesterday (I was catching up on some former Oscar winners on the day the 2007 Academy Awards were to be presented).  I hadn't felt a great need to see a racing movie because I'm not a fan of any class of auto racing.  However, I came away from this movie with an impression that I had seen an outstanding technical achievement with at least an acceptable storyline.

I am still rerunning many parts of the movie in my mind because of the many innovative scenes of Gran Prix racing.  We are treated to an ample amount of the speeding race cars and from a variety of angles.  There are shots from cameras mounted on the race cars, overhead shots, side angles etc.  this variety of perspectives keeps the racing action from becoming overdone.  Frankly, I'd guess that half the film is of the racing competitions yet, even though I'm not a racing fan, I did not tire of the action.

The other half of ""Gran Prix"" does not match the quality of the racing.  There are a mix of romances that are of moderate interest.  It's actually the cameraderie of the racers, the motives and perspectives of the auto-makers, and the ""candid"" thoughts of the racers that keeps the relatively slow-motion part of the movie on track (sorry).  James Garner does better when he's alowwed to be his mischevious self but his all-serious demeanor seemed to work all right after I got used to it.  Yves Montand was strong in his role but Eva Marie Saint came across too much like Leslie Stahl on an extended assignment; too little emotion but all the right questions and observations.  I was impressed with the Japanese Auto-maker but didn't realize, until the final credits, that it was Toshiro Mifune.  His moustache and neatly combed hair seemed like a camoflauge after all those Samuraii movies.

This movie is a long one but I only realized that when it still wasn't finished in time for the Academy Awards show.  I was caught up enough to stick with the movie instead of the awards.  This movie grew on me as the evening and the next day wore on.  I believe the excellence of ""Gran Prix"" lies in its' outstanding technical presetation and the way the action and the story alternate while giving us frequently changing perspectives.  I'm not sure I've seen that many movies that put as much successful effort into making us feel a part of such an esoteric society.",1172448000,3,2376,4.587677725118484
855497,4,6304366086,"Grand Prix is really a great treat if you are a fan of Formula 1 and its history.  F1 in the 1960s was a mixture of changing technology (rear engines, alloy wheels versus wire, disc brakes versus drum) and cars that were little more than ""coffins on wheels"" as one of the characters in the film describes them.

The movie takes place after the change to 3-liter engines and includes some of the great tracks and even greater drivers of the era. James Garner is the main character, an American racing driver who has his own personality problems, not the least of which is his drive to win at any cost, even the life and limb of his team mate.  Yves Montand plays a French driver for Ferrari who is still skilled but tired of the grind of the Formula 1 circus.

In the 1950s and 1960s it seemed that hardly a month went by without some highly talented driver getting killed.  Grand Prix weaves this thread of truth throughout the movie and lets us see why the races and cars were so dangerous.  Just watch the sequence at Spa Francorchamps and you will be amazed and/or horrified by how life threatening the tracks were compared to today.  The drivers bullet along at 180 mph on roads that have no guard rails, fans standing on the edge of the track and brick buildings 2 feet from the side of the car.  The Monza sequence is also thrilling to watch, sets you up for the tragedy that ensues.

This was an era of fearless men (and in Grand Prix, the women who loved them).  One of the treats of watching this film is the group of real Formula 1 drivers that are part of the cast.  Phil Hill (the American world champion for Ferrari in 1961), Graham Hill, Black Jack Brabham, Richie Ginther, Jochen Rhindt, and Dan Gurney are all here.  How cool it is to see them all acting out what must have been to them, their lives (at least as far as the racing part of their lives went).

The story is fairly straightforward with much of the story telegraphed through dialogue and character.  One character pushes himself to be as good as his dead brother, which is impossible.  He is not loved as much as his dead sibling (a former world champion), is not as good at his craft and is unwilling to quit until he tames the sport or it kills him.

There is a character that represents Enzo Ferrari, views inside the Ferrari factory, and comments that allude to the way Enzo pitted his drivers against each other and themselves to please him and to win.  They even call him Il Commendatore.

The cinematography is beautiful and the DVD is a magnificent copy, with only a few film artifacts to detract from the show.  Frankenheimer is really good when he is showing the gritty side of things - the pits, the racing, the shift linkages and suspension movement, in other words the racing side of F1 racing at that time - away from all the glitz and glamour.  The romance that weaves its way through the movie slows things down a bit, but it is handled well.  In fact, now that I am of the advanced age of 44, the story holds together better than I remember it at age 10.",1171584000,2,3050,4.3628318584070795

855577,4,6304366086,"This film takes us back to the final years of the pre-modern world of Grand Prix racing, an era when the old European aristocracy still set the tone, when commercialization was relatively minimal, when nationalistic rivalries were palpable, and when death was commonplace and safety an afterthought.

This film inserts the actors into the real racing scene in a way that would no longer be possible.  Grand Prix racing has now become serious big business, compared to which the world of the film ""Grand Prix"" seems almost amateurish.

""Grand Prix"" tells the story of Pete Aron (James Garner), a veteran American racer who is fired by his Jordan team after causing an accident which nearly kills teammate Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedford).  After a brief stint as a reluctant television commentator, Aron is hired by the upcoming Yamura team of Japan.  At the end of the film, Aron and his rivals - a recovered Stoddard, young Italian Nino Barlini, and aging French star Jean-Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand) - head to Monza for the climactic race in the world championship.

Interspersed with the racing are a series of romantic entanglements involving Aron and Stoddard's wife (Jessica Walter), Barlini and a mysterious, leggy Frenchwoman, and Sarti and an American fashion journalist (Eva Marie-Saint).  Racing fans might find these elements intrusive, particularly in such scenes as Barlini's boogeying in an embarrassingly lame recreation of a 1960's disco.  But in this film, you take the good with the bad, and if Barlini is a caricature of an excitable, uninhibited Italian, Montand oozes with suave, Old World charm, world-weary and philosophical.

And, for racing fans, the GOOD elements in this film are precisely those elements which are of a documentary nature, the scenes of real 1960's Grand Prix cars racing on some of the sport's most legendary circuits - Spa, Monza, Monte Carlo - circuits which, in the name of safety and commercialism, have now changed almost beyond recognition.

Older racing fans such as myself will recognize many of the great racers of that era, sometimes with assumed names, sometimes identified by their real names - we see Graham Hill, Phil Hill, Jochen Rindt, Jo Bonnier, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, Ritchie Ginther, and many others from that era.  Sadly, many were to die behind the wheel within a few years of the filming of ""Grand Prix.""

This has become a period piece;  it no longer reflects the realities of Grand Prix racing.  But it is a look into the past for those old enough to remember.  I suspect younger viewers will find it somewhat corny, even as 50-somethings are momentarily taken back to their youth.",1168473600,,2654,5.0136674259681095

The film mirrors the reality of Grand Prix motor racing back in the day with so many of those great drivers being tragically killed only a few years after this film came out, e.g. Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, J. Rindt.

Since seeing this film on the box years ago, I have anxiously awaited its return on Widescreen DVD format. Now having watched it again  on my HD projector with a 96"" diagonal and surround sound system, I can't believe how fantastic this film looks. Thank  Frankenheimer for filming in 70 mm as the detail is as good or better than any new movie on the big screen and the sound on Dolby 5.1 surround system is fantastic.

This film is a cinematic master piece and a time capsule of the vintage Grand Prix in '60's. Racing fans 100 years of years from now will still be watching and studying this film. It blows all other racing films out of the water including Le Mans (which I consider a boring waste of time).",1168473600,,1239,4.35064935064935
855579,5,6304366086,". . . but if you are a fan of this 1966 classic, arguably the best car racing film ever made, then you *must* see this version. I'm a huge fan - saw it when it came out and have been moderately obsessed with the film since - and I've been muddling along with the VHS for a decade.

Now I can see the quality (if not the size) of the original Cinerama film, enjoy the full fidelity of the gorgeous Maurice Jarr score, and see two excellent Speedvision documentaries about the film and 60s F1. Along with a promotional film from the period about the making of. Interviews, then and now, with Frankenheimer and some of the stars (Jimmy G. isn't lookin' too great these days!) The insights into Frankenheimer and his method are fantastic.

If you've never seen the film, don't expect much of a story, but the in-car racing footage has never been equalled in a feature film. That combined with the music and sound make for a very rewarding experience.",1168473600,,946,4.431034482758621

After seeing the theatrical release in the late sixties, my fascination and love for F1 racing began. I attended my first race in 1969 at Clermont Ferrand, one of the circuits featured in the movie.  The movie does an incredible job at depicting the essence of Formula 1 and, for those who have followed the racing series, it's a fascinating look at the evolution of the cars and tracks.  The inherent lack of safety in F1 racing at the time-both for drivers and spectators is hard to fathom in terms of today's level of safety when drivers walk away from horrendous appearing wrecks.  Similarly, it's amazing to see the virtually unrestrained nature of spectator access to track areas as shown in the film.  I can attest to the accuracy of that as I recall actually walking (maybe running) across a section of the track, during the race, at Clermont Ferrand during the race to gain a better vantage point.  Foolish as that may sound now, it was common at the time  The special features segment with commentary from the actors, director, actual F1 racers from that era, and current Formula 1 TV personalities and journalists is terrific.

855677,5,6304366086,"Even though it is now more than 40 years old, this is still one of the best, if not ""the"" best movie ever made about auto racing.  The camera work is amazing, especially for the time, and the sound is great.  The story line is acceptable, but the real story here is grand prix racing from the years when the grand prix circuit was truly the epitome of world motorsports.  The seamless inclusion of many of the star drivers and cars of the era to the film adds a dimension not seen in other non-documentary movies and will spark the nostalgic yearnings of any fan of 50's and 60's european-style motor racing.  The cars driven by the lead characters, although not true grand prix cars, are so closely replicated that very few techno-wizard fans of the engineering of the era will be able to discern the differences.  This is one of the few racing movies that truly makes the viewer feel as if he is actually in the car with the driver on some of the most famous European road courses.  The extra features are superb, with stories galore.  Best of all are the comments from those associated with grand prix racing describing how the director achieved such complete access to the actual race courses, teams and events so filming could be done in conjunction with actual races in the various countries.  That access was enequaled for the time and no other movie producer or director has been able to achieve that level of penetration into the heart of a racing venue since.  One forgets what auto racing was like before commercial sponsorships, and this movie is priceless for showing the peak of grand prix racing before it succumbed to the modern system of commercial sponsorship.  Today's commercial sponsorship and its ""big money"" is the reason that no film is likely to ever again equal this one.  No production company could today arrange for or afford to purchase such complete and unrestricted access.  That is the primary reason that, even in an age of computer-generated graphics and special effects, it is unlikely that this auto racing genre film will ever be duplicated or surpassed, so race fans had better buy this one while it is available.",1162425600,2,2152,4.694148936170213
855678,5,6304366086,I originally watched this movie in the theater after it was released many years ago. To be able to own it and have it in my home to watch whenever I choose is awesome.

855679,3,6304366086,"GRAND PRIX is really a simple story.  American racecar driver Pete Aron lets ego get in the way of team driving and causes a wreck with his partner's car, subsequently sending his partner, Scott Stoddard to the hospital.  Aron has to find another car manufacturer to race for and does, a Japanese businessman who is convinced Aron is going to be the winner he needs.  Meanwhile, Stoddard's wife, Pat, leaves him because she can't deal with all the risk her husband is taking, but she takes up with Pete.  French champion, Sarti, gets involved with an American woman who's writing magazine pieces on the sport.

John Frankenheimer created a unique look and feel for GRAND PRIX when he did the movie back in 1966.  One of his later movies, RONIN, starring Robert De Niro, used a lot of the same fast-paced action.  James Garner (MAVERICK, THE ROCKFORD FILES) stars along with a cast of international stars and Grand Prix racers.

Although the movie still seems to be hailed by a lot of race enthusiasts, when you watch it as a movie and not an homage, it's three hours long and you start to become conscious of the chair because there's no deep emotional commitment on part of any of the characters.  Still, the movie tends to draw the viewer in hypnotically, moving quickly from scene to scene with plenty of local color and character changes.  It's very watchable.

GRAND PRIX is definitely for the Formula One race fans, and a chance for a serious film student to step back 40 years and watch a master at work. James Garner fans will want to pick this one up as well because Pete Aron is an iconic Garner-type hero.",1161388800,11,1616,4.59581881533101

855683,5,6304366086,"These comments refer to the Two-Disc Special Edition (DVD):

In 1966, John Frankenheimer set out to make a racing movie unlike any racing movie made before [or since in my opinion] - and succeeded magnificently... He sent the actors to race driving schools, so when you see a close-up of James Garner in a formula car with the streets of Monaco receding behind him at speed, it's not on a sound stage with a projected background, it's taken with a camera mounted ON the car, and that IS James Garner, and it IS Monaco, and they're going pretty damn fast.

I originally saw it in Cinerama in Los Angeles, and about the only things that don't survive ""shrinking"" very well are the opening scene (where you realized you were looking down an exhaust - just as the engine started) and Frankenheimer's many-image mosaics - they're just too small to have the same effects.

Frankenheimer's racing scenes were taken during the 1966 Formula 1 season, in the two days following each race, so the backgrounds are completely authentic (except the 1966 Italian Grand Prix didn't use the Monza high banking...) He had his own fleet of F3 cars - each modified to look like a specific F1 prototype, so that the ""Ferraris"" LOOK like Ferraris, the ""BRMs"" LOOK like BRMs, and the ""Yamuras"" look an awful lot like F1 Hondas.

It's fun to see *real* F1 drivers (Phil Hill, Graham Hill, Ritchie Ginther, Dan Gurney, (all credited - and I thought I saw John Surtees) appearing in the background, some with a few lines

On top of automotive competition (winning, losing, accidents, mechanical failures, injuries, recovery) there are two or three sub-plots - basically ""who's sleeping with who"" - which pretty much can be be ignored.

The sound track and DVD transfer are excellent, with a bit of *faint* light vertical striping appearing in a few scenes.",1157155200,,1830,4.775316455696203
855734,5,6304366086,"Outstanding! Well worth the wait.

I have been a major motor racing fan since the mid-fifties (as a youngster, I attended the first US Grand Prix, Sebring 59, as well as several of the Sebring 24 hours where I got to meet Phil Hill). I saw the original movie, in Cinerama, multiple times, back when it first came out; it thrilled me every time and I practically memorized it.

It was with much trepidation that I started watching the DVD, hoping to not be too disappointed. I needn't have worried; it met/exceeded my expectations of it and did justice to my memories of the original in theaters.

I can't wait until we complete a major refurbishing of our Condo's Recreation Building to see it again; it will include a media room with a 60 inch Hi-Def television and a Bose Lifestyle 48 surround sound system. In our apartment (because of sheer size/space constraints in our older entertainment wall unit) we only have a 32 inch Hi-Def LCD with a Bose Lifestyle 35; yet even at 32 inch, the movie was most impressive...and the sound was awesome.

855870,5,6304366086,"For years, fans of the movie Grand Prix have been clamoring for it to be released on DVD. With that said, I will spare the formalities of reviewing the movie and get down to brass tacks - Was the DVD worth the wait?

The Good/Great: First of all the film looks and sounds great - comparing it to the VHS version doesn't give it enough justice. The transfer is stellar. In addition, the bonus documentaries provide a keen insight into Frankenheimer's desire to direct it, behind the scenes details, and cars and drivers of the era. To me, these features alone make the disk a must buy.

The Not So Good, or perhaps just a bit annoying: This DVD comes packaged on two disks. But be advised - it's not a deal where the movie is on one disk and the specials are on another. No. The movie itself is played out utilizing both disks. This means that at some point, you'll have to get up and switch disks in order to watch the entire film. For those familiar with the VHS version of the movie, the break occurs at the same intermission point, before the final race at Monza. While this may be a small annoyance, it would have been nice for the movie to be contained on one disk and the added features on the other. And for what its worth, its something that isn't pointed out in the product specs.

The Bottom Line: Fans of Grand Prix and movies of this genre will have a blast experiencing it on DVD. Crank up the volume!",1154563200,5,1414,4.288389513108614

If you find you're missing the insert, I think our only recourse is to contact Warner Bros and ask them to send it. This happened when Dune was re-released this year, but Universal promptly took care of the problem by sending out the inserts. Hopefully, Warner Bros will do the same. I am going to try my luck in doing this. Will update this review to let you know if I was successful! Update August 14: I sent an email to WB re: the insert problem.

855875,4,6304366086,"This is one of those titles that DVD fans have hungered for since the technology's first introduction.  Why?  Probably because many of us saw the film originally in the 1966 roadshow release in Cinerama and have vivid memories of that mind-bending experience.  Plus, GRAND PRIX is hands down the best car-race film ever to come from Hollywood.  The soap opera elements of the story are pure 1960s movie melodrama, but they work because they are bracketed by the most breathtaking, visceral race footage ever seen.  On an 80' curved Cinerama screen, the races were staggeringly real, and GRAND PRIX exemplifies one of the best uses of the 70mm Super Cinerama technology in the 1960s, along with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  The fact that very little process photogrpahy was used at all makes the film even more realistic, especially in some of those dizzying shots where the camera turns from the driver toward the road ahead and you're placed in the front seat of a rocket banking the turns at Monza.  Spec-tac-u-lar!  Superb restoration from 65mm negative elements and great re-mix of the six-track mag stereo into digital 5.1.  Terrific film, and thank you Warner Home Video, for taking the usual care to include the overture and intermission tracks that were part of the roadshow experience.

855877,4,6304366086,"I saw ""Grand Prix"" when it was first released. I was 17 and, like one of the other reviewers, was totally blown away by the experience. The Cinerama technology was pretty hot stuff in the 60's; the most visually and aurally realistic format of its time. I think I saw it 8 or 9 times and always from the front row. I felt like I was in the car and could almost smell the hot oil and Jessica Walters' perfume.

John Frankenheimer put together a beautiful film. The cinematography is still wonderful. Several years after seeing ""Grand Prix"", I was stationed in Europe. I had a chance to visit many of the tracks and he truly captured the beauty of the landscape. The racing scenes are amazingly realistic, especially considering that he pretty much had to invent the technology as he was filming. I briefly raced open wheel cars of that era and the movie experience was as realistic as you could capture on film. You couldn't get hurt watching the movie, so the fear factor is missing, but the sights and sounds were spot on.

I bought the VHS version and was disappointed. Big movie, little screen, pretty lame. The DVD on a wide-screen TV with a good home theater sound system will be pretty close to the original experience.

Being a big Steve McQueen fan, I wish I could say that ""Le Mans"" is better, but visually ""Grand Prix"" beats it hands down. What the heck, get both! Each has a sappy story wrapped around great racing scenes, but are worth the money.",1152835200,6,1458,4.494339622641509

I've seen 2 GPs at Brands Hatch in the '70s and while the short is excellent, it doesn't capture that excitement of your first hearing the engines. Yes, you really used to be able to get that close to the cars.  And Monaco is still 'the' race of the year.

""Brands Hatch: Chasing the Checkered Flag"" is a surprisingly entertaining look at a wonderful racetrack.

""The Style and Sound of Speed"" is a short documentary on the visual and aural style of the film. It was mildly interesting.

""Grand Prix: Challenge of Champions"" is a vintage look at the filming done in Monaco. This featurette is done in that oh-so-60's film style. You can't help but love it.

855960,5,6304366086,"Grand Prix is the greatest racing movie of all time.  Having searched and paid a premium for the VHS version, you can imagine my excitement when I learned of the DVD release of the movie.  I was not disappointed.  The pedigree of the movie is stellar.  The director is John Frankenheimer.  An international cast includes Eva Marie Sainte, Toshiro Mifune, James Gardner, and Yves Montand.  Francoise Hardy (""Tous les garcons et les filles"") is so hot, also credibly acts in this film.  Actual team names and cars (Ferrari, BRM, and All American Racing, but sadly not Lotus nor Honda) and famous drivers (Phil Hill, Graham Hill, Bruce McClaren), are in the movie and involved in the filming of the movie.  Actual race footage is incorporated into the movie.  Actual drivers are present in the movie.  The film won three technical Academy Awards, best film editing, sound and sound effects.  Before IMAX, before video games, before video cams, using sixteen Panavision cameras, some mounted on the racing cars, some in a Ford GT 40 chase car, Frankenheimer provides the exquisite shots we expect today on ESPN or SPEED...the view of the driver and pan to the front view, the vibration, the buffeting, the sweeping blur about a hairpin of actual driving.  That is why the movie stands the test of time.  As stated in the additional materials, it is unlikely that a racing movie of this scale will ever be made again.

 But this is not a documentary.  A great movie, even if it isn't true, is realistic enough that you believe that is reality.  The story lines touch on real issues... is winning everything, why do men like to go fast, are their significant others uneasy, why is death or danger ignored, can relationships be serious or merely transitory... It also provides a vicarious look into Grand Prix racing in the 1960's, the fashion, the life, the glamour.  Grand Prix DVD also provides special features that demand purchasing the DVD even if you have the VHS version (sans special features of course).  Five documentaries are provided...This movie was viewed on a 27 inch flat screen TV, sound through a subwoofer and two satellite speakers (two five inch mid-range, one two inch tweeter per speaker) and the sound was great (it did win an Academy award for sound)... I can hardly wait to see it on my friend's 52 inch wide-screen with Dolby Digital 5.1.  Wow...what a movie.",1152662400,6,2380,4.800982800982801

The storyline isn't brilliant by any means and there are a few `unexplained' bloopers such as Jean Pierre Sarte's mysterious helmet change from one race to the next - which was due to John Surtees leaving the Ferrari team at mid-season and signing with Cooper for a bit before eventually signing with Honda - but if you're a diehard Formula 1 fan this film is a true blessing.

I already own the Laser disc and still own one of the original programs that were sold at the movie theaters and I have been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for ages, simply in the hopes of viewing the treasure-trove of behind-the-scenes footage.

Although the film did not receive the critical success many felt it deserved the historic importance of this film should not be underestimated because it's the only clear color film footage available anywhere in the world where you can see; Graham Hill, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, Richie Ginther, Jochen Rindt, Bruce McLaren, Maurice Trintignant, Mike Parkes, Joakim Bonnier, Lorenzon Bandini, Chris Amon, Guy Ligier and even the great Juan Manuel Fangio together on the big screen and in their crowning glory. - Be sure to watch closely during the Spa Francorchamps drivers meeting when Jochen Rindt playfully reaches out and trips Graham Hill (aka `Bob Turner') as he's trying to step past Rindt.

For fans and students of cinematography the camera angles and the technology invented to achieve many of those angles are a testament to the ground-breaking achievements that underscore the unique and visionary genius of John Frankenheimer.  And of course there's a wonderful cast of outstanding actors including the great Toshiro Mifune, Brian Bedford, Yves Montand, Antonio Sabato, and of course, James Garner who was inspired by his role in the film and went on to enjoy moderate success as an amateur racer.

855964,5,6304366086,"Grand Prix is a classic.

Some people dismiss this movie as a good movie about great cars or about the technological advances the film made 40 years ago.  The true greatness of this movie is that it is a fantastic film about real car racing.  This film is a living/breathing entity.  The images are spectacular, yes, but the greatness is the story about real drivers and the lives they lead.

Saul Bass, the legendary Movie Titles genius puts Grand Prix as his all time favorite work.  And why?  Because even from the Titles, the movie breaths and lives.  The Titles run through the moments before the start of the Monaco Grand Prix.  The hearts beating up to the launch of the race.  The movie races at top speed from the very beginning.

More importantly is the question the movie raises about WHAT drives a human being to put his or her life on the line every time a driver fires up the engines of a race car.  The people in their lives who worry every second of every race.  Some who support the drivers only to take extreme joy in their ultimate failures.

It was a reserved-seat movie back in 1966, and in those days epic movies took their spectacle seriously. (Grand Prix is spectacular in a different way than Spartacus, which in turn is different from Lawrence, etc.)

Back in 1966, or '56 or '46, when actors drove cars in movies, even race cars, they were invariably back-projected. Seemed fakey then, though now it doesn't bother me. But Grand Prix was maybe the first movie to eschew back projection for actor-driving-car scenes. In GP, the 70mm camera that pans and tilts, is literally bolted on the cars. The scenery flying by is real. The actual actor, e.g., Garner or Ives Montand, is out in the weather driving his race car and driving pretty fast, and you're out there with him, two feet away.

855968,4,6304366086,"This Grand Prix DVD and a Widescreen TV are a match made in heaven.  There are certain movies that get better with size, and this film nearly leads the pack.

Just a technical note. Grand Prix was actually filmed in something called `Super Panavision 70mm'. It's a 2.20:1 aspect ration, but when first released, as noted by others, the film was shown on the old Cinerama curved screens. There are perhaps only two widescreen formats that provide a more extravagant presentation, Ultra Panavision (only a handful of films) and Cinerama itself.

About a dozen movies have been filmed in Super Panavision 70 (among them Lawrence of Arabia and My Fair Lady). They were spectacular in a theater setting, but, except for the above films, and perhaps Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang, none have been satisfactorily transferred to DVD, including 2001: A Space Odyssey and the recent Ice Station Zebra. Grand Prix appears to have been completely resored by MGM and includes a load of extras.  This is a great example of the blockbuster-style movies that are becoming very rare, and a must have for movie fans.

As for the story itself, Grand Prix is miles ahead of other racing movies, but that's not saying much. Winning, Lemans, Red Line 7000 were tedious, and Days of Thunder and Driven should qualify for ticket refunds.

I remember nearly falling out of my seat as the astounding race sequences played out before me. This is a truly organic race film, there are real drivers of the F1 era mixed in with the mostly European cast, though James Garner and Eva Marie Saint break the cross Atlantic barrier. This film is a wonderful technical masterpiece. It even has some fine dramatic moments in between the melodrama. Some might say this is the film's greatest short coming. That is true, but also where it really mirrors the emotional high that F1 has always worn on it's sleeve. F1 is a soap opera that is played out across the world, where the wealthiest mingle, though not too closely, with the proletariat for a few hours of high rev mania. Many of the courses in the film are still in existance, but they have been smoothed out and plundered of passion. Often the races held these days resemble a parade, but once in a while things go terribly wrong and a race ensues. And it is in capturing those glorious moments that the film really soars. You will feel the ripping of the air as a car tears through the streets of Monaco, and be stunned by the speed and savagery of a huge racetrack like The Spa in Belgium or the amazing high banked corners at the old track in Monza, Italy. The camera work is a virtuoso masterpiece of technical achievement. Many of the shots that we take for granted today on our live TV races were the brain children of the camera men who worked on the film. This film is the one all of that work we see on modern TV broadcast racing strives to emulate. You are in the race, in the cockpit, in the mind and the heart of the greatest racers in the world. And for those who know the history of the sport, the real greats of the sport in that era are on hand. Jack Brabaham. Graham Hill. Jim Hill. Bruce McLaren. Richi Ginther. Many of the great names that are featured in this film did not survive the harshness of the sport and succumbed to death because of failure of both man and machine. This film is a treasure. It may be out dated. It may be melodramatic. It may also be the greatest racing film ever, but some debate that the much more restrained, almost catatonic Steve McQueen film, Le Mans is the superior. I see them as equals, representative of the two types of mind sets in racing.

856014,5,6304366086,"Giving the movie five stars is a no brainer.  Everyone who ever managed to see this film in a theater loved it.  Eva Marie Saint had a pretty long career as a leading lady considering she wasn't glamorous and she wasn't sexy, though she often played in sexy parts.  Most often she was the blonde madonna type, chic and shiny, as in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and she had Actors Studio cachet, people thought she was a serious actress.  She was fine playing opposite Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT and with Paul Newman in EXODUS.  She played Kitty, the American visitor to Israel, and sometimes in GRAND PRIX she seems to be channeling all of ""Kitty's"" mannerisms, for both parts allow the US viewer to somehow enter, through her eyes, a complicated and complex European social system we might otherwise fail to register with.  This is what she does best, and as the journalist Louise Frederickson she goes right to the heart of the matter, travelling on an expense account through Monaco, Nice, Monza, everywhere the story of Formula One takes her.  And what a story it is!

As soon as Monaco explodes into the fiery crash that injures poor Scott Stoddard, we see that Pete Aaron is carrying around the burden of guilt for this accident, even though Scott himself went in with his eyes open.  This gives GRAND PRIX a good dramatic edge that some of the other racing movies don't have.  Such as LE MANS or WINNING, even though I like them both too.  Here in GRAND PRIX director John Frankenheimer lets us see Aaron's inner working out of his guilt.  At the same time we see Yves Montand struggling through his conflicts about racing politics and his own preference for l'amour.  The two storylines ping and pong back and forth creating their own tension.  This is one feature that belongs on DVD pronto.  And while they're at it, tell me, what about THE GAMES with Ryan O'Neal?  Not a racing picture per se, but it is the Olympics version of GRAND PRIX, with Charles Aznavour playing the Yves Montand part.  I don't think THE GAMES came out even on video!  What's the story and why are they suppressing the great movies about competition?  THE GAMES is from a treatment by Erich Segal, the author of LOVE STORY, and features his LOVE STORY ephebe Ryan O'Neal in a prominent role.  O'NEAL plays an Ivy League sprinter, a golden boy, who decides to enter the Marathon at the Olympics with a little assist from his best friend, Sam Elliott, whose deep deep voice is put to good use as he joins O'Neal in a Tokyo hot tub and calls him ""baby"" throughout in a Barry White baritone.  When O'Neal tries to recover from not enough sleep, Sam Elliott hands him a pill.  Then when the runner stumbles in the business section of Tokyo, Sam flags him down and palms him off with another pill.  You know trouble is on its way!

But what about Stanley Baker, the most brooding masculine man in British acting, coming over like Heathcliff and dominating not Cathy Earnshaw but tall, bumbling Michael Crawford in his full Frank Spencer mode straight out of ""SOME MOTHERS DO `AVE `EM.""  Crawford plays a milkman, Harry Hayes, who gets taken up by the toffs who run the Royal Running Club and match him up with tyrannical, overbearing coach Stanley Baker.  In one scene Crawford flops around a padded room, wearing extra clothes, while the thermostat registers 150 degrees, while Stanley Baker barks orders, while himself stripped for comfort down to a skimpy pair of white bikini underpants.  It is bizarre indeed.

Well, so is Charles Aznavour as the Czech track god Valcek, once the world record holder and now ordered at age 41 to re-enter the Olympics by his Communist boss to give Communism a good name.  And there is an Australian story with an aborigine abused and misused by two white yobbo trainers slash bookies.

A great show with lots of action and a wonderful performance by Leigh Taylor Young as a coed Ryan O'Neal takes a shine to.

856015,5,6304366086,"Nothing can compare with the exciting way this film distills the essence of Grand Prix racing.  The BRM's, the Lotuses, the Ferrari's, and the Honda's are incredible machines and their power roars in this film.  They are the mechanical equivalents of James Garner, Eva Marie Saint, Yves Montand, Toshiro Mifune, Brian Bedford, Jessica Walter, Francoise Hardy, Antonio Sabato, and Genevieve Page - some of the best actors of their generation.  The cars were at that amazing pinnacle of design before technology subverted esthetics.  The actors offer compelling performances.  The film comments on how the characters struggle to balance their personal lives with the demands of an increasingly voracious public clamoring for a vicarious thrill (much like we as viewers crave being a part of the exciting racing action depicted in the film).  The cinematic achievements are incredible - I still marvel at the remarkable footage that captures the failure of a front suspension strut.  Frankenheimer used no process shots in the making of the film.  GRAND PRIX has the noise and visceral feeling of the track - and also the dream-like euphoria when speed transcends time to become poetry.  The cars, the drivers, the fans, and the tracks are all well represented.  Frankenheimer melded art and technology to create a beautiful and awesome film.  GRAND PRIX also includes the amazing photography of Lionel Linden, a wonderful musical score by Maurice Jarre, and brilliant editing by a team lead by Henry Berman.

Like, a previous viewer - I was privileged to see GRAND PRIX several times during its initial release (in my case at the Cinerama dome in Hollywood) where the 70 mm Cinerama print, the projection, the sound, and the screen allowed the optimal presentation of the film.  Now with home systems offering comparable sound and picture - it's time to restore this film so that a new generation can experience the excitement captured by this film.  Turner Classic Movies will be presenting the film on Saturday 02/19/2005 at 12:30 AM and on Thursday 04/07/2005 at 04:00 PM if you want a preview.",1107129600,5,2095,5.069970845481049
856016,5,6304366086,"I saw this movie in my small town theater at the time of it's release, I was 7 years old. The opening in-car scenes were so intense as I sat in the front row that I became ill and missed the rest of the movie that day. Stallone tried, or at least he thought he did, to make a racing movie of this caliber with Driven. Driven doesn't even come close. The next best would have to be either Steve McQueen's Le Mans (which is available on DVD) or maybe Winning although I haven't seen Winning in quite awhile.

Contrary to what one reviewer says there's absolutely nothing hard to rate here. The cinemaphotography is second to none, the acting is top notch and the story line is as well. Contrast that to Le Mans which is nearly a dialog free racing observation. Both are excellent for fans but Grand Prix is a better story.

Come on, this is EASILY the best racing movie ever made and is widely accepted as such except for maybe someone who knows next to nothing about the genre. The footage is awesome here and it's way beyond time that it got the deserving DVD with extras while some of the original cast/production are still alive to do commentary. Unfortunately we lost Frankenheimer in 2002 maybe about a year after doing a Speedvision special presentation of this great movie, I was fortunate to have tapped it. James Garner, like all of us, unfortunately isn't getting any younger and Eva Marie Saint, Brian Bedford, Jessica Walter and Antonio Sabato are all still around for possible commentary as well.

856018,4,6304366086,"Just a technical note.  Grand Prix was actually filmed in something called `Super Panavision 70mm'.  It's a 2.20:1 aspect ration, but when first released, the film was shown on the old Cinerama curved screens.  There are perhaps only two widescreen formats that provide a more extravagant presentation, Ultra Panavision (only a handful of films) and Cinerama itself (IMAX isn't spectacular, it's just big).

About a dozen movies have been filmed in Super Panavision 70 (among them Lawrence of Arabia and My Fair Lady).  They were spectacular in a theater setting, but, except for the above films, and perhaps Chitty Chitty, Bank Bang, none have been satisfactorily transferred to DVD.  2001: A Space Odyssey was not done well, and Grand Prix and Ice Station Zebra are as yet unavailable at all.  I can only hope they are working to restore the films and add extras, a la Lawrence and My Fair Lady.  As for the film itself, Grand Prix is miles ahead of other racing movies, but that's not saying much. Winning, Lemans, Red Line 7000 were tedious, and Days of Thunder and Driven should qualify for ticket refunds.  Grand Prix is worth watching in it's original presentation.  If they ever put out a DVD, it should be a restored, 2.20:1 widescreen Special Edition.

I've watched the movie several times on the little box but it's never duplicated the original experience. I CANNOT BELIVE it is not yet available on DVD.  If ever a movie deserved the DVD treatment this is it.

What director Frankenheimer does in this movie is still exciting even by today's standards.
Even though I am a huge Steve McQueen fan, Le Mans definitely takes second place to Grand Prix.
I was really excited to see the movie Driven with Stallone, until I saw it.  All I kept saying to myself was ""This is not even close to Grand Prix"".  Grand Prix has not only raised the bar, but has set it as well.

I remember nearly falling out of my seat as the astounding race sequences played out before me. This is a truly organic race film, there are real drivers of the F1 era mixed in with the mostly European cast, though James Garner and Eva Marie Saint break the cross Atlantic barrier. This film is a wonderful technical masterpiece. It even has some fine dramatic moments in between the melodrama. Some might say this is the film's greatest short coming. That is true, but also where it really mirrors the emotional high that F1 has always worn on it's sleeve. F1 is a soap opera that is played out across the world, where the wealthiest mingle, though not too closely, with the proletariat for a few hours of high rev mania. Many of the courses in the film are still in existance, but they have been smoothed out and plundered of passion. Often the races held these days resemble a parade, but once in a while things go terribly wrong and a race ensues. And it is in capturing those glorious moments that the film really soars. You will feel the ripping of the air as a car tears through the streets of Monaco, and be stunned by the speed and savagery of a huge racetrack like The Spa in Belgium or the amazing high banked corners at the old track in Monza, Italy. The camera work is a virtuoso masterpiece of technical achievement. Many of the shots that we take for granted today on our live TV races were the brain children of the camera men who worked on the film. This film is the one all of that work we see on modern TV broadcast racing strives to emulate. You are in the race, in the cockpit, in the mind and the heart of the greatest racers in the world. And for those who know the history of the sport, the real greats of the sport in that era are on hand. Jack Brabaham. Graham Hill. Jim Hill. Bruce McLaren. Richi Ginther. Many of the great names that are featured in this film did not survive the harshness of the sport and succumbed to death because of failure of both man and machine. This film is a treasure. It may be out dated. It may be melodramatic. It may also be the greatest racing film ever, but some debate that the much more restrained, almost catatonic Steve McQueen film, Le Mans is the superior. I see them as equals, representative of the two types of mind sets in racing. The passionate, fiery visrtuoso who crashes as much as he wins, and the technician, the cool headed pro, who always finishes, and manages to win more than a few in the process. Which is better?

856074,2,6304366086,"""Grand Prix"" attempts to be soap opera & race movie, & manages neither well.
As a race movie, it details Monaco & Monza with the high banked curves. In between the first & last race of the season, everything else is brushed off. Spa gets some spots because of many shunts; many tracks are not even shown on screen, only mentioned in passing.
While the cinematography may have pioneered, it gets self-indulgent, where the multiple split screen is used without serving any purpose of story-telling or tension. While at some points they work (the last race, to show internal flashbacks of the driver on one side & that driver at the race on the other; to show the major drivers & then zoom in on one), far too often they simply distract from the story & bore the viewer. These happen mostly during the ""many races pass"" section, when we might have seen some racing, instead.
On the level of story & character, this film fails even more miserably. James Garner is stuck playing a cipher: as another one says, ""All anyone knows about you is that you're a driver."" His reply: ""That's right."" Other than being desperate to race, he has absolutely no character traits, past, emotions, or motivation.
The ones who have those attributes have such hokey inconsistent ones that they are thoroughly unbelievable. 4ex: a woman leaves the driver she's married to because she can't stand the stress of waiting for him to rack up. At that point she takes up with -- another driver. Supposedly this is because she doesn't love him, so she won't be bothered. We are supposed to believe that she just didn't get completely out of the race world? When she leaves her husband is immediately after a terrible accident that might end his driving career, too. She comes back to him later, even though she still hates the whole business, because he has shown true guts, not ""just stubborness,"" about getting back into competition. All the characters are so phony, or so stiffly acted, we could never really identify with one.
The end is an especially fizzle. A main character dies, but because he has reached no resolutions, it is not a tragedy, it is not a climax, it's just an accident. Garner is finally left standing on the empty track, hearing the motors roar, but because we have no sense of any conflict or interior life for this character, it is all just empty sound -- rather like the whole movie.
As the final insult, in the VHS transfer the sound levels are extremely irregular.
On the whole, we got the impression, not of a racing movie, but of an anti-racing movie. We won't waste time on it again. We'll watch Le Mans for the 30th time, instead.",1057104000,3,2633,4.628205128205129

James Garner, Yves Monstad, Toshiro Mifune, Antonio Sabato, Eva Saint Marie deliever a stellar performace. This is a MUST have in your DVD collection. I have viewed this movie many times, and its capturing the young generation of motorsports enthusiasts. The action is excellent, filmed at a time when racing was racing, to live and die. Its also nice to see the legendary circuits, Monaco, Spa, Zandvoort, which the later 2 are no longer part of the F1 calendar.

Although the stars are heavy-weights, they add to rather than detract from the racing yarn - Garner does wonderfully, as do Eva Marie Saint, Yves Montand and Toshir Mifune.  This is an A+ movie all the way, historically close to the fact, and well worth seeing three-plus decades later.  The story line is less clichd than most pf the racing genre - triumph, overconfidence, loss, disappointment, catastrophe, victory!  And the actors aren't just pretty doodads stuck in and around racing cars, they actually seem to know something about what they're doing.
The video depicts the last of the classic era (or the first years of the rear-engine era, as you wish) of Formula One.  Many of the real drivers of the 1960s had cameos in the movie, and if you watch for them you'll see one or two in almost every track scene.  This is a must for those building a racing video library.  Far better than ""Days of Thunder"" with respect to being true to the actual sport (cars with smashed in body-work haven't won Daytona in years - except with Tom Cruise driving), and widely acclaimed in its day for pure cinematic accomplishment.  It's still a great, great movie (and if you've got a copy of Grand Prix Legends installed on your PC, you can go out and race the same tracks you just watched on the video).",1043366400,2,1373,4.644628099173554

Eva Marie Saint is cast as a magazine journalist following the grand prix circus around Europe, trying to get a story - a storyline that was recently successfully resurrected in ""Driven"". Her lovestory with Montand is not exactly hot, but the highly dramatic race action in Monte Carlo, Spa, and Monza (they still used the famous banking of the autodromo in those days!)more than makes up for that. The film features cameo appearances of some of the era's greatest drivers like Graham Hill.

In those days the movie theatre played a movie over and over during the day.  I was entranced and watched the film twice in a row. Some of the effects were unheard of in those days and the perspective of speed and gritty engine sound were intoxicating.
Upon review, many films from my youth fail the test of time.  Not this one! It is still a valid and pertinent statement about the cost of participation in motorsports at this level.  The excitement is the same.  Some commentarists have suggested that some of the characters and plot development is shallow, but how true!  In this film you find both deep and shallow characters, just as in life.  It is a film about the human drama that doesn't go overboard and doesn't forget that without the machines and the racing there is also no point.
An interesting and final note is that my 15 year old son is just as excited about the movie and is actually the reason that I made the move from rent to buy.

Afterwards, Frankenheimer gradually deteriorated as a director and the racing car epic ""Grand Prix"" sadly seems to be the film that signaled the end of this once great filmmaker.
The nearly three-hour-long ""Grand Prix"" is a well-meaning but instantly forgettable racing car drama.  The film chronicles the lives and loves of four international auto racers: American James Garner, Frenchman Yves Montand, Englishman Brian Bedford, and Italian Antonio Sabato.  Technically, the film is brilliant; the camerawork and and film editing are excellent.  Unfortunately, the superior technical work cannot save the film.  ""Grand Prix"" is a decent yet bloated and unmemorable racing car epic.  John Frankenheimer couldn't seem to decide whether to create a straight dramatic film or a documentary about international auto racing.  ""Grand Prix"" goes into significant depth about the sport of race car driving; the film potentially succeeds more as a documentary than as a straight drama.  The film is overlong by about an hour.  Frankenheimer basically wastes a great cast.  James Garner, Brian Bedford, and Antonio Sabato do their best with a somewhat lackluster script.  The late great Toshiro Mifune is given a completely thankless role as a Japanese automaker; Mifune would go on to work with Frankenheimer one more time in the mediocre action film ""The Challenge.""  Eva Marie Saint, who plays a journalist, and the charismatic Yves Montand are the only players who manage to succeed in adding some sorely needed magic for the film.  Although she earned an Oscar for ""On The Waterfront,"" Saint never quite became a superstar and was definitely worthy of such a rank.  Saint was truly a thinking man's sex symbol.

The visual affects may be lost on those who have never seen it on a big screen, which is truly the only way to experience it, but once seen that way, the experience will never be lost when viewing it on a TV.  The European flavored music is refreshingly wonderful and again comes into its place on a big screen.  A number of reviewers also describe the plot as plodding; well contrast this movie with todays shallow, poorly acted, nothing new storylines, and this movie stands on its own merits.

I snuck into a Formula 3 event in downtown Pau, France. Standing 10 feet from the track, I will never forget the ferocious sound and awesome speed of the Gitanes sponsored Ligier Formula 1 race care doing a few demonstration laps prior to the Formula 3 race. Since that day I have been addicted to the sound and speed of Formula 1 racing. The only way to supplement this fix between races and during the off season is with movies about racing and races on tape. When I first began watching Grand Prix, I assumed it would be a dated, silly, and testorone fueled film, like Stalone's worthless vision of CART racing. Instead, it was a realistic portrayal of racers. Though critics may talk of poor character development and a thin plot, they fail to recognize that this isn't about global politics. It is simply a movie about racers and the siren song of speed. The movie has some of the best in car footage I have seen to date.  For those who love racing, you will love this movie.  For those who know nothing about racing, nor care to learn, this film will probably disappoint.",1000944000,4,1254,4.495614035087719
856239,4,6304366086,"I purchased this movie after learning about it from the director's (i.e. John Frankenheimer's) commentary from the ""Ronin"" DVD. ""Ronin"" features great car chase scenes and I hoped that this movie devoted to 1960's F1 racing also by Frankenheimer would be great too. And it is, which is why I recommend the film.
Some of the scenes are a bit dated, and one racing sequence with corny orchestral waltz music playing was frankly awful, but there is more to like than not, and by the time the action of the film arrives at the Monza race track, you'll forgive the bad parts.
The only I reason not to buy the wide-screen VHS is to hold out for the DVD.",998524800,2,647,4.445378151260504
856240,5,6304366086,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in 1966 when I was 16 years old.  It made such a life long impression that I took up the sport of motor racing when I was old enough to afford this expensive sport.  My whole introduction to motor racing was through this movie.  It was outstanding in every detail.  Great acting, actors, drama, storyline, acuracy, script, I can't say enough about this movie.  I personally own three VCR copies of this movie.  One to view, one kept in a safe deposit box, and one to loan to friends to get them excited about motorsports.  That should tell you why this movie must be put into DVD format, so it can be enjoyed with the outstanding resolution and sound that DVD is so famous for.

856241,5,6304366086,"I first saw ""Grand Prix"" in a Cinerama Theater when it was released in 1967. Unbelievable! Today; it holds up. I would love to again see it on a Cinerama screen. Nothing compares to that kind of presentation. It is simply the finest racing movie ever made. ""LeMans"" w/Steve McQueen was also very good, but ""Grand Prix"" has a plot. John Frankenheimer's camera work is superb. He again used similar camera mounts on cars when filming ""Ronin"". ""Grand Prix"" is stunning in many ways. From the streets of Monaco to the actual banking at Monza, it is a masterpiece. It needs to be released on DVD. The Soundtrack is wonderful, as well. Some of the most beautiful music - The Grand Prix Overture, you will ever hear in any movie! It has been said that this kind of movie will never be duplicated. I believe it. When Stallone approached F1 about his idea about a racing movie, he was shunned. He went to CART, made ""Driven"", and it has it's moments (few). There is no comparison. Even with today's technology, I guess the cost to 'even' try to achieve what John Frankenheimer achieved would prohibit such a 'grand' production. He was basically given the space he needed, even the Ferrari factory allowed access, to make his masterpiece. And folks, this movie is a masterpiece! Forget the date of 1966. The cars are gorgeous, the acting superb, and the tracks - wow! You will even see cameos by some legendary drivers of the era. Graham Hill, Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, Jochen Rindt, and others.",997401600,18,1482,4.638783269961977
856242,5,6304366086,"I recently purchased this movie after reading an article with James Garner and past F1 champion Jacques Villeneuve about the movie.  I am hooked!  I've watched it twice already and I am still in awe of the driving action.  The racing on the old courses are great and provide an excellent back drop to the action on the road.
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in F1.  I do believe that a movie like this could be made with the cars driven today.  It's too bad Sly Stalone was forced to make a movie about CART.  Who wants to see a bunch of guys drive around an oval track?",980121600,4,601,4.228070175438597
856317,5,6304366086,"The action is terrific. A must buy for all racing aficianados.  Some may feel that the plot is rather thin, but I feel that it depicts life  off-track as it really is----just as hum-drum as the rest of ours. That  adds a nice balance to the craziness on the racing circuits.  The racing  machines themselves are a work of art, unique and with a character all  their own.  I feel that the world of Formula 1 racing had it's Golden Age  in the 1960's, and has gone downhill since then. The drivers were very  distinguishable from one another, sportsmen and gentlemen in the true  sense.  This film captures all of the flavor of that bygone era.",967507200,2,642,4.448275862068965

856319,5,6304366086,"""Grand Prix"" is the finest racing movie ever produced.  The story involves the pursuit of the Formula 1 World Championship by four men:  Jean-Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand), an aging former champion who grows weary  from the acute physical demands of the sport and team politics; Nino  Barlini (Antonio Sabato), a brash, fearless young lion; Scott Stoddard  (Brian Bedford), a man broken in body yet driven to match the legacy of his  deceased brother; and Pete Aron (James Garner), a stoic, pragmatic American  fighting to restore a faltering career.  The Ferrari Team Manager comments  during the film, ""Everyone wants to win...there is no distinction in  that.""  What distinguishes these four men from others is the sheer  force of will each exhibits to overcome his personal demons and to achieve  his final destiny.
The drama unfolds amidst many of the great racing  circuits of Europe...the narrow, twisting streets of Monte Carlo; the  rain-slickened expanse of Spa; and the tortuous, high, concrete banks of  Monza.  John Frankenheimer's inventive split-screen imaging and on-board  cameras put you inside the cockpit where you sense the raw power and  road-pounding vibrations from these sleek racing machines.  You are at once  deafened by the high-pitched whine of superbly tuned engines as they roar  off the starting grid...and then mesmerized by Maurice Jarre's soft,  eloquent musical score set to compelling visual images of cars rising,  falling, and turning through the racing circuit in a ballet of speed,  grace, and beauty.  I agree with an earlier review that DVD would  materially enhance the appeal of this production and I sincerely hope DVD  will be forthcoming.  Regardless, ""Grand Prix"" will forever serve  as the quintessential racing movie.",951782400,78,1767,5.297101449275362
856320,3,6304366086,"I'm an amateur racer and lover of all things retro, but I can only like ""Grand Prix"" so much.
Sure, the opening sequences and surreal closeups are interesting and exciting, but they wear thin well before the  end of even the first tape (a two-tape set) and can't carry the lurching,  plodding story line.  What starts off as seemingly bold artistic  experimentation starts looking more like ""Hawaii Five-0"" trailers  as the film progresses (rapid zoom-ins, etc).
If you've got to have it,  confine yourself to the first 30-45 minutes (through the Monaco GP race).  If you don't, you may find your other viewers evaporating faster than race  gas on hot concrete.",946944000,5,661,4.891891891891892
856321,4,6304366086,"From the days when men were men, tires were skinny and Ford DFVs still had velocity stacks. Great victory party with a driver crawling around on a table, the other drivers (actors, presumably) filling his trophy with beer.  Play spot-the-driver during this scene; you can see Graham Hill among other  real drivers of the day, looking faintly horrified. Great stuff. Lots of  cameos (Phil Hill, the first American F1 champion among them) from the era  and Frankenheimer really brings the action alive. A little melodramatic in  spots, a goofy love story sub-plot, but Eva Marie Saint looks terrific.",938044800,4,598,5.061224489795919
856322,4,6304366086,"As a young boy I had a 8 track tape of the sound track for Grand Prix. I remember listening to it and could picture what was happening in the movie, even though I did not see the movie until recently. But after watching it  and listening to the background music my early thoughts were right on. It's  a excellent movie, which I now own. Too bad somebody does not have the  sound track on C.D.",931392000,4,392,4.131578947368421
856323,5,6304366086,"Grand Prix, is enjoyable many ways, whether you're a racing fan or not. I was lucky enough to see this movie in ""Cinerama"" as a 10 year-old boy when it was released and it instilled in me a life-long appreciation of  filmmaking and motorsports.  Having now grown up and having seen more of  the world, more motorsports, and more movies I love this movie more now  than I ever did at 10, but for different reasons.  For the racing fan in me  there is no end to the joy. There is a faint smell of gasoline in the air,  the blare of a weather beaten P.A. system, a slighty teary eye from too  many burnt hydrocarbons accumulating in too small a place too fast, a  slight ache high in my nostrils from airborn bits of burning brakes and  tire rubber, and the sweet hum of a high-RPM motor behind my ears when I  pop this in the VCR. There is no doubt this movie has POV shots of racers  in competition better than anything seen, before or after. The use of a  then revolutionary electronic and microwave camera systems developed by  NASA allowed for steady, clear 3/4's POV, close-ups, panning shots from  sideview to POV on the same car, as well as third person views of all  aspects of the actors racing inches from one another in real Formula 3 cars  (mocked up to resemble cars and liveries of the '65 F1 season)as they  followed cars driven by Phil Hill ('61 World Champ for Ferrari) around all  the iconic venues of Formula 1 at speeds sometimes as fast as 125 mph.  You  can see and feel the tension, the initial hesitation of passing a car at  speed and the exhiliration of doing it smooth, safe and clean in the  actor's faces because it was real.  The sweat you see is not makeup, the  wide eyes and clenched jaws aren't acting.  What you see are men who know  that one slip, a one millisecond lapse in concentration would be  devastating.  And this allowed the director, John Frankenheimer, an amateur  sportscar racer in his own right, to break down the barrier between make  believe and reality for his prinicipal actors, James Garner, Brian Bedford,  Yves Montand, and Antonio Sabato, Sr. The angst of the characters becomes  real for me, they aren't caricatures, because the actors reaction to these  experiences were those of the men they portrayed - I've know what it's like  to feel that I could be the best under the right circumstances like Pete  Aron (Garner regularly drove in sanctioned races after his appearance in  GP), I know what it's like to know your good at what you do but still  wonder if you're the best like Scott Stoddard (Bedford never drove a car  until GP), as a young pup I lived and loved in the fast lane like Nino  Barlini (they couldn't get Sabato out of the cars), and as an older man I  sometimes feel weary and mortal like Jean-Pierre Sarti (Montand, the  consumate frenchman, preferred the love scenes over the cars). The score by  Maurice Jarre is as exhilirating during the dramatic racing sequences as it  is gentle during the montages by Saul Bass exploring the driver's pysche as  they race.  What's different in this movie for me now -- not much, except  when I was 10 I thought the important characters were Aron and Stoddard,  Aron cause he was a good guy done wrong and Stoddard cause he was heroic.  I now realize the central character is Sarti, because Sarti was the  happiest.  ""Pete, do you ever get tired, of the driving? Lately  sometimes I get very tire, know what I mean? Very tired.""",928195200,7,3445,4.491909385113269
856324,5,6304366086,"Grand Prix is far and away the best racing movie ever made.  Although, by today's standards the cars may seem archaic and the plot just a tad predictable, it still ranks as a technical masterpiece.  Many of the  techniques employed by Frankenheimer are still considered state of the art.  Michel Legrand's soundtrack is a superb example of scoring a movie without  overpowering the plot or visuals.  The acting is excellent with an  especially noteworthy performance by Garner as the overly competitive  American driver and Montand as the disenchanted French Driver.  Both have  parallels in today's Formula Circuit.  This movie proves that a good actor  can be a good racer, but a good racer is not necessarily a good actor.  Note the cameo appearances of the late great Graham Hill.  The only movie  I have seen that even comes close to Grand Prix in terms of cinematic  excellence in this genre is Le Mans with Steve McQueen.",920246400,,928,4.852564102564102
7868855,2,6304366086,"I bought my DVD copy of this movie from another vendor, and it's rarely, if ever, worked right.  When it does the image is crystal clear, the audio clean, and the movie looks good.

But most of the time the disc won't even read.  I have no idea why.  In fact it read better on my old XP computer than on my Win10 machine which I build the year before last.  And now on a newer computer with two new BD drives, it will not read at all.

The movie itself is so-so.  We get an over dramatized look at formula one racing from days of yore, when it was simply a man behind a wheel, and an engine and fuel tank behind him.  Those days were heady and dangerous.  I remember seeing the footage of them, and it was not for the feint of heart.

Assuming you can see the darn thing.
