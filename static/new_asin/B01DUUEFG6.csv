7724779,4,B01DUUEFG6,"600 Miles is a very low budget film where some of the action happening, occurs nearby of camera, but for the most part we're there. It sort of has the appearance of a deliberately supposed to look amateur film, or documentary where the camera man is there, but isn't acknowledged by anyone there. So we're sort of a fly on the wall viewer so to speak. I knew that an American gets abducted, tied up and smuggled into Mexico, but that was my extent of knowledge of 600 Miles going in. That does happen, although not at first, at first we're watching an American white nerdy social loser type teen shopping for guns. He shoplifts everything else along the way. It seems it should be obvious to the guy behind the counter of the first place he chickens out of buying one at that he doesn't want it for hunting as he claims and you'd hope it isn't that easy for someone who isn't even putting on a good act of legitimate need for weapons (he wants ten), to get them. I was wondering if this was going to be a gun control or pro gun movement lobby movie, but thankfully it moves away from either, when the white kid gets in trouble for something and goes back into the store to pay and Hank (Tim Roth's character) tries to arrest his Mexican teenage friend at gunpoint who is sitting in the car. Up to then the Mexican kid had been pretty much just touching a painful bit of acne on his earlobe over and over again, while being physically picked on by the white kid, with a brief moment of bragging that he smuggles guns across the border at some relative's kid's backyard party. Unfortunately for Hank the white kid has gone out a different exit from the shop circled around and cowardly hit him from behind. The next thing Hank knows, he's in the car alone with the Mexican, with the Mexican clearly stressed and out of his depth, not knowing what he is going to do. The movie gets a little violent at times, some people do die, but overall it's a pretty slow movie, without much talking, the camera will sometimes just sit stationary with nothing happening for a while, like a car leaving a car parking space and another drives in thirty seconds later.

At times English is spoken at others Spanish (there's subtitles). I was never really sure why the Mexican kid smuggled Hank into Mexico other than for perhaps not wanting to be arrested in America if he'd let him go before making it to the border, but then I didn't know why he didn't just dump him on the side of the road once across. There weren't any extras on the DVD for anyone to explain anything (Australian version), and the movie only goes for 80 minutes.

If you don't like slow movies, or ones that have an amateur look to them, 600 Miles probably isn't the movie for you. But if you don't mind those things, it's more than worth checking out.",1461715200,,2806,4.383877159309021

7724787,5,B01DUUEFG6,"A disturbingly realistic portrayal of the US-Mexican cross border trafficking in guns. Easy to find young males with little education and no future, but extended family ensconced in illegal activities to draw them into their dangerous, lucrative quick cash trade. A lot of viewers will be put off by the ATF agent's portrayal, but he survives because he knows how to lie and do what's necessary in that deadly world.",1468713600,2,416,4.957142857142857

7724796,4,B01DUUEFG6,"This is not your typical big budget shoot em up loud music movie.  Rather it is fairly quiet because there is no music or other sound editing to block natural sounds of the scenes.  It is the story of new straw buyers/gun runners supplying firearms to the drug cartels in Mexico.  In fact it shows how matter of fact and easy it is to buy AR 14s or 15s for ""self protection, target shooting or hunting.""  There are visits to the gun shop, the private gun seller in his home and a gun show.  Then there are the car trips with all the regular motor sounds which I found perfectly sufficient and realistic.  There is violence, but it is an interesting story which you enjoy if you are willing to sit through a somewhat slow moving movie.  And if you do make it to the end, don't turn it off at the credits because there is a scene that starts with Hank in his kitchen and then fades to black as the credits roll and you just hear the sound between him and his wife.  I won't say anything else about it, but it ties into an earlier scene.  Also, quite an interesting way to roll the credits.",1468540800,,1087,4.1875

Great acting, well made but they literally ran out of steam or money at the very end and just left it undone. It's a shame because I loved it right up to that lousy ending.",1483228800,2,319,3.8484848484848486

8756921,4,B01DUUEFG6,"If you're looking for wall-to-wall action and/or an edge-of-the-seat thriller, then give this film a pass.  But if you want a solid thought-provoking portrayal of gun trafficking on America's southern border, you'll find it here.  Highly recommended.",1476921600,,250,5.72972972972973
8756922,1,B01DUUEFG6,The ending is unrealistic and unsatisfying.  It is like the production company ran out of money to pay the writers and just ended the movie.  They had a good film and then ruined it with this abrupt truncation.  I would have given it a zero but you can't do that.  Don't waste your time with this one You will kick yourself.,1475971200,,324,4.262295081967213
8756923,1,B01DUUEFG6,This movie did not meet expectations for the actors in it or the intended story. Very slow moving in a major way. We use a 15 minute rule when reviewing / watching films. The only reason we stayed with it was because of Tim Roth. What a waste of time and an actors skills. Too bad. I'd like my view time back for something more pertinent. We rated at all just because it started Tim Roth.,1472256000,,388,4.118421052631579
8756924,4,B01DUUEFG6,"yes, some of the thinking and reactions to situations  of Tim Roth's character was strange  , but I thought the way the movie depicted life for so many Mexicans, ( having to be a part of the criminal scene, either because they had no other way, or family member's, or how they (narcos) are revered) in order to make SOME type of living, and the power that the narcos have over common folk, was very well depicted. I thought mister Roths role was well done. sure beats unrealistic movies on subject matter.  the power of crime and crime bosses in Mexico is very different from here, as well as the level and magnitude of poverty and tradition , people have to realize this, i believe to grasp how well this movie portrays that.",1471478400,3,726,4.443609022556391
