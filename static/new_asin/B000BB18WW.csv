2410953,5,B000BB18WW,"I'd switched on a free TV in the middle of the movie and was pleasefully amused with same gender affairs teen somehow-stupid comedy taking in a laughable world of adultscene  quandaries, far away from the murdering, killing, shooting and simply rape of usually screened movies.

This comedy is highly recommended for trying to have a rest from surrounding wherever on a globe where these topics are not taboo.",1233878400,,409,5.0

2410955,1,B000BB18WW,"The longest movie I have seen, even though it lasted only 93 minutes. A lousy clunker in every way. Why do people tolerate such awful movies just because they are gay? The plot, the script, the acting, and practically every aspect of the movie are as bad as I have seen in recent years. I also find the broad brushstrokes the movie uses to paint every single man in it as a flighty, silly, sex-crazed creature of the old stereotype extremely offensive.",1185926400,,452,4.524390243902439

2410957,5,B000BB18WW,"This movie really got to me. The plot summary doesn't tell you what the movies REALLY about. Bai isn't really a playboy, Bai has a phobia for relationships. In dire fear of having his heart broken he ends up only having one-night stands and which leads to everyone thinking he's a cold hearted playboy. When he meets and falls deeply in love with Tien he has to face his fears before he breaks Tien's heart and loses him. Don't worry its a happy ending! :)

Its so rare to find a good gay movie that isn't a total comedy or tragedy. I highly recommend this to anyone just looking for gay romance without the tragedy or dumb jokes. A++ ;)

2410958,3,B000BB18WW,"'Shi qi sui de tian kong' (FORMULA 17) is a very fine first venture into film making by two young Taiwanese women - Yin-jung Chen, director and Rady Fu, screenwriter - who are unafraid to take on a taboo subject in Taiwan and find some excellent talent and ideas that suggest that there will be more films from them in the future.  Though the central theme and two characters  of the story are excellent, the movie drifts into wide-eyed burlesque with its supporting cast, and thus the three stars rating instead of four.

Tien (Tony Yang) is a naive seventeen-year-old from the provinces who comes to Taipei to live with his old friend Yu (Chin King), a bartender in a gay bar,  for a summer.  Tien is gay, a virgin, and intends to stay a virgin until he is in a meaningful love relationship. Yu is suffering from a relationship that is tainted by distance, but he sees the need to introduce Tien into the active gay life in Taipei - and to put an end to Tien's virginity. Together with Yu's friends (way over the top flamboyant kids) Tien is introduced to gay bars, is set up with hunks, but he holds to his values - until he eyes 30-year-old playboy  Bai Tieh-nan (Duncan Lai), a lothario famous for his one night stands. We gradually learn that Bai is a sensitive hunk with issues who is afraid to fall in love, hence his one night stand rule.  The story at the core of this film is how the two ultimately fulfill each others' ideals and needs.

Much of the film dawdles in stereotypical situations and poorly acted and directed excursions into the bar scenes, but the work of Duncan Lai and Tony Yang makes the film credible and well worth watching: both men are handsome, talented actors who develop a fine screen chemistry.  For all its weak points, FORMULA 17 is a film with a big heart and a gay film that manages to deal with some important issues of fidelity and honesty instead of focusing on merely the superficial. In Mandarin, Cantonese, English with subtitles. Grady Harp, April 06",1144540800,15,1997,4.509695290858725
2410959,5,B000BB18WW,"I really loved this movie. It graduated to taking a spot in my Top 5 Favorite Gay Films. It's sweet and comical, never mean-spirited and offers not only romance but a tale of true friendship as well. I really like how the narrative changed at times for dramatic effect. Plus the boys were all so damn cute!",1144108800,6,306,4.385964912280702
2410960,5,B000BB18WW,"Wow! I was excited about finally getting the chance to see this film, but I must say that it totally surpassed my expectations. In my opinion, this movie is a real milestone- up there with Lan Yu- in Chinese gay cinema.

Although what other reviewers have said about it being a bit amateurish and formulistic at times is true, to an extent, the director and the actors somehow manage to pull the project off really well. All of the characters are extremely well-developed, and you find yourself falling in love with them before you know it. Because of the quality and passion behind the funny, touching performances, the actors breathe new life into even the most possibly stereotypical roles- from the over-the-top queen at the local gay bar to the gruff, bewildered, straight best-friend of one of the protagonists.

The movie has a very quirky, satirical, experimental bent, which takes a bit of getting used to at first. But, within 10 minutes of starting the film, it had me hooked. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie since I saw Pirates of the Caribbean in the theater! (Oh, and I have to say it- the guys in this film are almost all totally hot. I'm booking a flight to Taipei now!!)",1141430400,12,1200,4.629107981220657
2410961,4,B000BB18WW,"""Shi qi sui de tian kong"" (""Formula 17"" is the English title) (2004) is from two twenty-something female independent filmmakers in Taiwan, who bucked the normally-conservative bent of filmmaking in that country, resulting in a light and enchanting coming-of-age romantic comedy about a 17 year old boy and his search for love in the Taipei gay community.

Coming from a smaller town to spend his summer vacation with his former schoolmate, Tien is a romantic who believes sex is best reserved for when you find someone you love, and resists temptations to ""hook up"" in the big city, including an seduction by a hunky ""plumber"" arranged by his roommate.  Tien is immediately attracted to Bai, a 30 year old businessman who has a reputation for one-night stands, and he is understandably leery of the man's attentions.  Meanwhile, he helps his friend get over a failed long-distance relationship, and tries to resist the temptations of hunks at display at his summer job, at a health spa.  When Tien and Bai eventually do get together, but Bai avoids him the next day, Tien's flamboyant friends go on a ""mission"" to hunt him down and avenge their friend.  The story resolves itself in a madcap scene not unlike countless US teen films, with the only difference being the language spoken (Cantonese and Mandarin - and some pigeon English - with English subtitles) and the fact that these teens are gay.

Rather tame by US rating standards (An ""R"" mostly just for gay content), with no real nudity or simulated sex, although the subject matter did result in the film being banned in Singapore.  Popular at many US gay film festivals.  DVD extras only provide chapter selection and control of subtitles.  Amateurish on many levels, but worth a look; I'd give it 4 stars out of 5.",1134345600,8,1774,4.8283828382838285
2410962,5,B000BB18WW,"Formula 17 was really quite a funny movie since I did not know anything about it; I was surprised that it was a comedy about homosexuals.  Well people should not watch this movie if they might feel uneasy watching it.  The plot of the Formula 17 is simple.  Basically, for the summer the main character, Chou Tien Tsai, decides to move in with his friend from junior high, Yu.  Tien Tsai, is a virgin who is interested in finding true love he believes that love is a kind of faith.  However, Tien Tsai's friends try to get him to lose his virgnity.  Subtlely, Tien Tsai develops an interest in Bai Tien Nan or Richard, the Playboy and soon have a relationship.  I do not want to give away everything but that is what it is all about.",1134000000,3,733,4.306569343065694

8084590,2,B000BB18WW,The cover of this DVD is very beautiful and striking. But the content is poor and poorly done. Unfortunately there are few quality films on this subject. It seems that the filmmakers still confuse love when he manifests gay with worldliness or porn. So it's no wonder when African countries implement laws with the death penalty for homosexuals. It seems that Western culture has a strong tendency to self-destruct. The Asians have all the conditions to make good movies in this issue but it seems that the industry is still very shy.

8084595,2,B000BB18WW,"Well, what can one say? This mildly interesting film was so uneven. The good parts included the charming love affair - the two young men were genuinely attractive and nice people. There were some clever moments, such as the scene on the kerb between the lads and the older guy. Funny and well done. The usual caravansary of silly, loud queens - de rigueur in most gay themed films - came and went. The film worked best went they went. Their silly overacting and endless squeaks as tedious as usual. The dreadful non stop pop-crap music track was a definite downer and had litle to do with the drama. The fast forward button got over some of the dull bits. I almost gave up on the film untill the relationship got underway. Things improved from there.",1311984000,,750,4.522058823529412
