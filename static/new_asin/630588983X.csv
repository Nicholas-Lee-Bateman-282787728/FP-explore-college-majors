7897342,4,630588983X,"A young hoodlum lands in a juvenile prison. Later, While working for the prison, He and a few of his friends escape and begin committing a series of crimes [mostly robberies]. They all eventually get recaptured by the cops and they all land back in jail, But they're released early, but soon, They all land in serious trouble with a crime boss. Upon first look at the cover, You'd most likely think that this is gonna be another one of those little hood movies, But that's not exactly the case. Instead, it's more like a teen crime drama. Much in the vein of ''Bad Boys'' [A similar film that was released in the 80's and starred Sean Penn], This movie has pretty good acting and it's pretty entertaining. The only weakness is that its very low budget makes some things appear silly [For instance, The scenes that involve people being shot] and the music in this movie is at times extremely silly [Especially that stupid rap song that plays in the scene where the guys land back in jail]. For a movie that was released in 2000, This movie looks more like it came from 1990 [And i wouldn't be surprised if it's really that old]! Overall, I'd reccomend this movie to those that like movies that deal with crime and/or troubled kids. In fact, If you have digital cable or satellite tv, You can catch this movie on encore inblack sometime. Hope the review helped. I'm out.",1184716800,,1368,4.520161290322581

I LIKE HOW THIS MOVIE SHOWS THAT BLACKS AND LATINOS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO MESS AROUND IN THE STREETS. OCCASIONALLY, THERE ARE SOME SLOW SPOTS, BUT THE SECOND HOUR MAKES UP FOR ALL THE BORING SCENES. I'D SAY THIS IS WORTH WATCHING.",1069632000,,386,4.301369863013699
