3142009,5,B00158K14G,"It's great to see that 20th Century-Fox is finally bringing out a tribute
collection to Carmen Miranda, one of their biggest stars during WWII.
It would have been nice if they had put ""Springtime In the Rockies"" in
place of the ""Gang's All Here"" which is already available in the Alice
Faye collection, perhaps they will be bringing it out in another Betty
Grable set or maybe a John Payne set. While I'm at it how about a Alice
Faye collection II! Anyway this is a great set! Thanks Fox!!!!!!!!!!",1204934400,9,497,4.533333333333333
3142010,5,B00158K14G,"Fox musicals aren't as well known as the MGM musicals of the 40's and 50's or even the Warner musicals of the 30's. However, they did some pretty good stuff over the years. You have to remember that with these films, as with the MGM films of the same era, that plot is entirely secondary. It is just there to prop up the music and dancing, which are the main events.

The 5 disc DVD set will include:

Greenwich Village (1944) - NEW TO DVD - starring Don Ameche, Vivian Blaine, Carmen Miranda, and William Bendix. Don Ameche is particularly good in his role as a composer. Miranda's numbers include ""Give Me a Band and a Bandana,"" ""I Like to be Loved By You,"" and ""I'm Just Wild About Harry,"" all performed with great energy.
If I'm Lucky  (1946) - NEW TO DVD - Vivian Blaine actually has the starring role in this remake of ""Thanks a Million"". No Technicolor and no real memorable numbers, although it is a pleasant way to pass the time.
Something For the Boys (1944) - NEW TO DVD - Probably the weakest film in the set. Miranda gets top billing, but she gets rather mediocre support, particularly in Perry Como. He is rather wooden in his performance here. Phil Silvers, though, comes off quite well.
Doll Face (1944) - Former Alpha release - Vivian Blaine is a burlesque performer who wants to become a legitimate song and dance gal. This effort to change her act, and the players involved, is the comedy backdrop to the film. Memorable numbers include ""Somebody's Walking in My Dream"", ""Here Come's Heaven Again"" and ""Red, Hot and Beautiful"". Perry Como sings one of his break-through songs ""Dig You Late"". Carmen Miranda performs ""Chico Chico"". Based on a play by Gypsy Rose Lee.
The Gang's All Here (1943) - Released last year and remastered for this set. This is probably the best musical in this set. The story is really there just to boost morale during WWII. There are quite a few good supporting players in this one - lanky Charlotte Greenwood, Edward Everett Hornton, Eugene Pallette, and lending musical support is Benny Goodman and his orchestra. Best of all, Busby Berkeley directs.

Unlike most of Fox's recent releases, such as Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan, this set will release all the films as singles at just under fifteen dollars each. No word on extra features yet.",1204588800,27,2285,4.606879606879607
3142021,5,B00158K14G,"I bought this set after seeing a biography of Miranda on Youtube.  The bio I saw is included as an extra on one of the discs here, and I'm glad to have it.  The movies, too, are good and Miranda is the best thing about them.  She is such an amiable, fun-loving personality that you can't help watching her!

3142030,3,B00158K14G,"The ""Gangs All Here"" has long been one of my favorites...Sadly someone at Fox destroyed the technicolor for the DVD release...part of the charm of this movie was over-the top colors. All gone now. Story, music, Carmen and Alice..can't be beat..a great film! Breaks my heart not to see this as it was made.",1284595200,2,305,4.666666666666667
3142041,4,B00158K14G,"What you get is the Fox films in which Carmen was featured from !943, '44 and '46. Most of her earlier films can be gotten individually and are in the Alice Faye or Betty Grable collections. The two '46 films are in B&W rather than the previous Technicolor that always accompanied Fox films featuring Carmen. This presumably reflected a real or engineeered decline in her Box office appeal and caused Carmen to terminate her Fox contract. There are some extras. as well. Those on  'The Gang's All Here' disc feature the careers of Alice Faye  and Busby Berkeley, while Carmen's story is featued on the  'Something for the Boys' disc.
  One can also think of this collection as 'The Vivian Blaine Collection' or 'The Perry Como Collection', as it includes a good chunk of their rather limited Hollywood careers. The generally acknowledged gem of the collection is 'The Gang's  All Here', in which Busby Berkeley was given free reign as director and choreographer to unleash his surrealistic imagination in a musical extravaganza. Although not the centerpiece of the script, Carmen makes immunerable appearances, in a variety of outlandish outfits, and provides much of the comedic moments.
  To me, 'Something for the Boys' is also a gem, perhaps even more entertaining than 'The Gang's all Here', despite its outrageously daffy story line. With Phil Silvers stealing the show with his humor and penchant to run things, it has the best balance of music and comedy. Screen time is well divided between the multiple stars, including Vivian, Perry and leading man Michael O'Shea. The stars all had great chemistry with each other, starting off with sequential renditions  of the song 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could fall in love'. Carmen leads several production numbers. This film demonstrates what a great comedy team Carmen and Phil could have made. Some have characterized Vivian as the poor man's Betty Grable or Alice Faye, but I thought she sparkled in this film and in 'Greenwich Village', the other '44 Technicolor film in this collection.
  'Greenwich Village', although prominently  displaying Carmen in various roles, suffers somewhat in comparison as entertainment from the lack of Phil Silvers and from a too serious staid  Don Ameche. It's not without interest, however.  Vivian is radiant in her first starring role, although she and Ameche seem miscast as apparently highbrow entertainers associated with William Bendix's dive. You get the typical Bendix of the later TV series 'The Life of Riley'. His chief asset as a comedic actor was his distinctive exaggerated takes. Tony and Sally de Marco return from 'The Gang's All Here' to do a brief dance routine. The Four Step Brothers was an all African American group. I counted at least 8, not 4. They put on an entertaining band-dance routine, including acrobatic dancing, similar to that of the Nicholas Brothers, featured in several other Fox musicals of this period.
  Now for the two B&W films. You might wonder how Carmen could possibly go over well without color. Well, in 'If I'm Lucky', she and her entourage emphazized striking B&W outfits. Color wasn't everything about Carmen! Vivian's hair was also changed from Technicolor reddish to blond, for greater contrast. This is a remake of the '30s film 'Thanks a Million'. I haven't seen the original, but some reviewers prefer it. The same 4 stars of 'Something for the Boys' return. Also, Harry James and his band make a significant presence. Unlike his film debut, Perry Como is the leading man in this one. Unfortunately, this means he is given too much screen time for many people, who find his persona too bland. Depends what you are in the mood for. Phil and Carmen again team up for much of the somewhat muted comedy, and Phil again wants to run everyone's business. However, perhaps the funniest scene is Perry's unlikely exposing of the corrupt political machine leaders backing him, in a campaign speech. Edgar Buchanan is another well recognized presence, being perfectly cast as the drunkard political blowhard whom Perry replaces as the puppet for the political machine.
  Carmen is least prominent in 'Doll Face', the story of which was inspired by Gypsy Rose Lee. Although she appears briefly from time to time, she's not really important to the story. She has one production number, called 'Chico Chico, from Puerto Rico'. Unfortunely, her performance with a lighthouse on her head was deleted, although viewable as a special feature. Unlike the other films, she had no comedic male counterpart she could give and take with. Thus, this is strictly a musical, not a musical comedy. That is its greatest shortcoming, since the ballads, while generally OK for romantic slow dancing, are generally not of the memorable class. Also,  rather drab melodrama, rather than humor, tends to fill in the time between musical numbers. Perry Como again is featured. I counted 6 songs he sings, sometimes accompanied with dancing girls, sometimes to or with Vivian or Martha Stewart. The classic 'Hubba Hubba Hubba'is the only lively tune, he does with Martha Stewart. Perhaps more than any other song, it expresses the jubilation over the recent conclusion of WW II, thumbing their noses at the defeated Japanese, and telling the servicemen to go home, have some frivilous fun, find a girl to marry and get ready for a bright future. The expression 'Hubba, Hubba' generally was used to express interest in someone of the opposite sex, like a wolf whistle, or to denote excitement about something. In the context of this song, both usages are relevant.
  Carmen is still recognized as a one-of-a-kind entertainer, not only for her outrageous self-designed costumes, rapid fire nonsensical verbiage and sinuous dancing, but for her very expressive face and eyes and comedic talent. Of course, she was the subject of frequent humerous imitations, from Mickey Rooney to Lucille Ball on film. It's a shame her comedic talents weren't utilized to a much greater extent, both by Hollywood and on early TV. Can you imagine her as a regular on The Phil Silver's Show or I Love Lucy? Unfortunely, her hectic performance schedule, problems with studios, and disasterous marriage caused her to turn to drugs to cope, contributing to a relatively early death.",1282953600,,6271,5.027965284474446
3142042,4,B00158K14G,"Carmen Miranda is at her funniest in these films, it's just a shame  that the only film in the bunch that's really top notch, is The Gangs all Here, which is also part of the Alice Faye collection, still it's worth having for an occasional viewing of the highly talanted Carmen Miranda",1278806400,,285,4.480769230769231
3142043,5,B00158K14G,"The Carmen Miranda Collection has five films: The Gang's All Here; If I'm Lucky; Something for the Boys; Greenwich Village and Doll Face. This box set is a must-have for any Carmen Miranda fan; and the DVDs have wonderful bonus features. Here's a list of the films and what you can expect:

The Gang's All Here----The Gang's All Here is a stunning musical thanks to the talents of Busby Berkeley, Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda. The musical numbers directed by Busby Berkeley impress me as some of his finest work.

Andy Mason (James Ellison), an army man during World War II, meets Edie Allen (Alice Faye), a showgirl at a nightclub. Andy falls for Edie almost immediately; and Edie finally returns Andy's affections. What Edie doesn't know is that Andy is expected to marry Vivian Potter (Sheila Ryan). Thus Andy lets Edie think his name is Casey so things won't get jumbled. Andy returns a decorated war hero--and Edie's become a star in the show. Complications immediately arise when Andy has to manage the problem that he's promised himself to two girls--Edie and Vivian.

Look for Carmen Miranda as Dorita, Edie's friend who also works in the nightclub; Carmen's ""The Lady In The Tutti Frutti Hat"" number is outrageously fun. Edward Everett Horton and Charlotte Greenwood give outstanding performances as Vivian's parents Peyton Potter and his wife Blossom--and boy, can Charlotte Greenwood dance! Benny Goodman plays himself as the bandleader in the club; and Benny's real life orchestra play themselves in this movie.

The choreography can't be better--this is a Busby Berkeley musical, after all. The cinematography also reflects Busby's genius. In addition, the DVD comes with a commentary by Drew Casper and there's an Alice Faye short film entitled We Still Are.

If I'm Lucky----If I'm Lucky is good for a few laughs and you get great song and dance numbers. Carmen Miranda steals the show with her singing and dancing; and it's wonderful to see Harry James & His Orchestra.

We meet the principle members of a traveling band who are excited about their audition with the Titan Tire Company for its radio show. Linda Farrell (Vivian Blaine) sings; Earl Gordon (Harry James) is the bandleader; Michelle O'Toole (Carmen Miranda) sings, dances and even plays the harp and Wallingham M. 'Wally' Jones (Phil Silvers) essentially manages them all.

After their audition is canceled, they walk around hungry--until they spy a gubernatorial candidate's rally with free food! They join to get hot dogs and beer; and they meet the candidate for governor, Darius J. Magonnagle (Edgar Buchanan). They also meet singer Allen Clark (Perry Como) and they get hired, including Allen, to go with Magonnagle's campaign and provide entertainment.

However, the current governor has his cronies push Magonnagle out of the race so he's not a threat; and they place Allen Clark as a figurehead candidate for governor so they can do as they please. Allen threatens to expose them; but the governor's buddy Marc Dwyer (Frank Fenton) lets Allen know someone will ""take care of him"" if he does. The fact that Allen and Linda have fallen in love makes matters even more complicated.

Something For The Boys----Something For The Boys could have been better; but it could have been worse. The musical numbers are well done--for the most part. This is essentially a light-hearted musical. The choreography impressed me.

Three cousins inherit a dilapidated old Southern plantation. The cousins are street salesman Harry Hart (Phil Silvers), factory worker Chiquita Hart (Miranda) and entertainer Blossom Hart (Vivian Blaine). The three of them go to see the ""estate;"" but they have no money to fix the place up.

However, Sergeant Laddie Green (Perry Como) and Sergeant Rocky Fulton (Michael O'Shea) drive up to inform the cousins that they want to buy the house, fix it up and use it as a boarding house for the wives of some military personnel. The cousins accept; and the wives of the military men put on a show to raise money and make the old place shine.

Rocky and Blossom fall for each other; and that's rough when his fiance Melanie Walker (Sheila Ryan) shows up. Rocky no longer loves Melanie; but Blossom is so upset she won't let Rocky explain. We also see that because of the factory she worked in for so long, Chiquita has carborundum in her teeth that make her a human radio transmitter. (?)

Something For The Boys is a better than average musical with some great moments--but it also moments I'd rather forget. Perry Como sings wonderfully but he can't act. People who like light-hearted classic musicals will enjoy this; and look for the excellent documentary about Carmen, ""The Girl From Rio.""

Greenwich Village----Greenwich Village is a great musical. There are outstanding song and dance numbers all throughout the film; and Carmen gets top billing! The choreography couldn't have been better. Although the artwork indicates that Perry Como performs in this picture, I couldn't find Perry anywhere!

It's 1922 in Greenwich Village, an artistic haven in New York City. Kenneth Harvey (Don Ameche) gets off the bus and he wanders into a village speakeasy owned by Danny O'Mara (William Bendix). Kenneth meets the outrageously fun singer/dancer/ fortune teller Princess Querida (Carmen Miranda). He also lays eyes on Danny's girlfriend Bonnie Watson (Vivian Blaine) who sings there. Danny has feelings for Bonnie; but when Kenneth also begins to have feelings for Bonnie trouble starts.

Kenneth came to the big city to track down ""the great Kavosky"" (Emil Rameau) and have his concerto performed; he wants to be a classical composer. Danny ""lifts"" some of Kenneth's music and puts it into his own upcoming show. Bonnie, who begins to return Kenneth's affection, is opposed to Danny using Kenneth's music.

Greenwich Village easily rivals some of the best MGM musicals out there. These song and dance numbers are quite memorable. The DVD comes with some still photos taken behind the scenes and more.

Doll Face----Doll Face is a fairly good musical. The musical numbers are choreographed very well.

Mary Elizabeth ""Doll Face"" Carroll (Vivian Blaine), a burlesque queen, comes to a Broadway theater with her boyfriend and manager Michael Francis ""Mike"" Hannegan (Dennis O'Keefe). She tries out for Flo Hartman's (Reed Hadley) new operetta called ""Park Avenue;"" but Hartman won't hire her because she's a burlesque queen. Doll Face and Mike are upset--until Mike decides that Doll Face should write a book to prove that she's got class. When Doll Face doubts that she can write a book; Mike says they'll hire a ghost writer and pay him to make it look like Doll Face had written her autobiography.

But trouble starts when ghostwriter Frederick Manly Gerard (Stephen Dunne) sees Doll Face--he falls for her and Mike feels threatened. Mike also gets advice from Chita Chula (Carmen Miranda) who works in Mike's show. After Fred and Doll Face get stuck on the water in a boat when all they wanted was to reach their publisher on a small island, Mike misinterprets this and he dumps Doll Face. She's angry too and romance blossoms between her and Fred. In addition, we get a few extras. There is a deleted scene and the stills gallery is very nicely done.

Doll Face is a ""B"" movie musical that could have been an ""A"" rated film if Fox had given it its due. The musical numbers are pretty good but without color they lacked that certain ""something extra."" However, if you like classic musicals, consider adding this one to your collection.

The Carmen Miranda Collection has five films that may vary in overall quality--but Carmen's performances are invariably flawless. Get this and enjoy Carmen's talent!",1243382400,2,7703,4.99687743950039
3142044,3,B00158K14G,"This is a really nice collection of silly Fox musicals, none exactly screen classics, but very typical of the splashy items that were hot in the mid-forties. The best is certainly GANGS and it looks terrific, here, much better than the earlier transfer in the Alice Faye box. And the transfers are the most certainly the big kick, here. Everything looks really good, probably better than when first released, and that's saying something. These were all three-strip Technicolor. But the digital upgrades are really wonderful looking.

Carmen Miranda is nicely showcased here for fans and neophytes, alike. A couple of the films are somewhat exotic items that don't show up on tv. SOMETHING FOR THE BOYS, which is based on a Cole Porter play, but retains only one Porter song, looks really lovely and is very entertaining.  GREENWICH VILLAGE is another one of those turn of the century things that Fox did forever, and it's fun. DOLL FACE has a much better transfer than the public domain version that's been around for ages. IF I'M LUCKY is a very slight little black and white entry. Perry Como shows up in three of these.

3142048,4,B00158K14G,"It was with great fun that I was able to see the old Carmen Miranda movies.  As a ten year old - and older, I really loved musicals.  I went to see every musical movie that was showing at the cinema in a small country town in Queensland Australia.  We were only allowed to go to the saturday matinees, and that was the event of my week  then.  I always remembered the Carmen Miranda movies as being funny - only in adult life did I see them as 'camp'.  When I discovered that I was gay, the whole picture fell into place.  Carmen was an extraordinary performer, quite zany but at the same time very entertaining. In retrospect I can see she was not a great actress, but personality and her mad sense of acting was very much of that period.  Viewing them again now, I am enjoying them so much and am getting so many laughs.  I have introduced them to younger friends, who are laughing along at the ridiculous situations, but enjoying the whole movie with me.  Boom-chick-a-chick Carmen.",1219968000,4,985,4.392265193370166

However, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of production and entertainment value in all the films, even in the black and white movies (""Doll Face"" and ""If I'm Lucky"", which haven't received the best Amazon reviews.  Carmen Miranda is a joy to watch, a fascinating talent that certainly evokes a by-gone era of movie-making.  She's great in Technicolor or black and white!

This set preserves the Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat's South American charm and manic energy. Among the gems here are The Gang's All Here, proving that psychedelic color existed way before the '60s; Greenwich Village, with fast peeks at future celebs such as Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Judy Holliday; and Doll Face, based on a script by Louise Hovick, better known as Gypsy Rose Lee.
To be sure, Fox's musicals had neither the edge of Warner Brothers nor the ultra-glamour of Metro, yet for sheer exuberant charm, they can't be beat. Alice Faye, Phil Baker, Don Ameche, William Bendix, Vivian Blaine and Perry Como surround La Miranda in these films, but no one can out shine her.

3142067,5,B00158K14G,"This is a fab set of old films starring one of Brazil's greatest samba singers, Carmen Miranda.  True, these are not her ""best"" movies, but Hollywood ruined Carmen quickly and once she came to the US, all we ever really got to see were glimpses of her dazzling performing power. As it is, I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who is curious about the Carmen Miranda legend... The first film, ""The Gang's All Here,"" is a frothy collaboration between Carmen and the great choreographer Busby Berkeley, who indulges himself in some wonderful visual gags and inventive tracking shots.  The movie has a playful, giddy tone, and Miranda thrives in it from the first frame until the end. She has great costumes and strong musical numbers, with backing from her ace Brazilian band, Banda Da Lua. This film alone is worth the price of admission.

The other movies aren't on the same level, but they're still fun, particularly if you have a taste for World War Two-era B-movies. (In the burlesque-tinged ""Something For The Boys,"" erstwhile female lead Vivian Blaine actually turns to the male lead and says, hey, the boys have lots of talent, and we've got this big old house -- ""Let's put on a show!"") The Fox studios surrounded Carmen with a cast of regulars that included Vivian Blaine (yawn), Don Ameche, Phil Silvers and Perry Como.  In ""Greenwich Village,"" an affable Ameche shines as an aspiring classical composer who gets caught up in the heady, bohemian art scene, while that lovable lug William Bendix hams it up as a gruff nightclub owner who nonetheless fixes things up so that Ameche can become a star...)

The real draw, of course, is Carmen Miranda, an artist who sizzled like a live wire when she came to the United States in 1939 (if you can, check out the samba records she made before she came here, and you'll hear where her famous charisma started...) and she continued to dazzle whenever given half a chance (check out the shockingly vaginal pink-and-black dress she wore in""Greenwich Village"" - still scandalous after all these years!)  Sadly, Miranda worked herself into an early death, but she also created and kept tight control of her own cannily-crafted public image as a kooky, warm-hearted Latin bombshell, and these movies, even if they have their shortcomings, are still vital parts of her legacy.

Not only are these top-quality prints of vintage movies that have mostly never been on DVD before, the folks at Fox also wisely decided to augment them with archival features such as old TV appearances and movie shorts (including a follow-the-bouncing-ball singalong trailer that was shown in theatres in the 1940s) and, even more wonderful, there is a feature-length documentary tacked onto ""Something For The Boys"" that profiles Carmen Miranda's career, from her early years in Brazil to the meteoric rise and slow fizzle of her Hollywood career. The doc includes thoughtful, insightful commentary by numerous Brazilian and American film scholars, journalists and Carmen Miranda mavens -- and LOTS of cool archival footage from throughout Miranda's career.  Definitely worth checking out.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)",1214179200,6,3175,5.020912547528517
3142068,3,B00158K14G,"It's nice that Carmen Miranda is getting her own DVD collection, but with the exception of the re-mastered version of The Gang's All Here, her best films are already available individually (Week-end in Havana) and as part of the Betty Grable (Down Argentine Way) and Alice Faye (That Night in Rio) collections (they're also sold individually).  The best of her other films at Fox, Springtime in the Rockies, is not included here. Her co-star in her last four films at Fox was Vivian Blaine, ""the cherry blonde,"" who never really made it as a movie musical star.  And the films are significantly less good than Carmen's first ones. By that point, she had become a self-parody, and her films put her in unimaginative musical numbers with bad songs and ridiculously over-the-top costumes.  By her last two films (Doll Face, If I'm Lucky), Carmen had been downgraded to black-and-white musicals and she bought out her contract.  Since the re-mastered Gang's All Here will be sold alone, then I would only recommend this collection for die-hard fans of Carmen Miranda or Fox musicals.",1206748800,39,1079,4.94475138121547
3142069,5,B00158K14G,"Carmen Miranda was rarely the star of those wonderful 1940s musicals at 20th Century Fox, but whenever she was on screen, you couldn't take your eyes off her. Most of her great performances have already been released with the Alice Faye and Betty Grable Collections, but there are still plenty of reasons to rejoice with this collection.

Busby Berkeley's The Gang's All Here (her best film) is going to be re-mastered for this collection with the same extras as in the Alice Faye Collection. The other two Technicolor treats in this set are Greenwich Village (with Don Ameche and Vivian Blaine) and Something For The Boys (Vivian Blaine and Perry Como). Both are new to DVD. If you enjoy Carmen Miranda, you will not be disappointed with all three of the Technicolor musicals in this box set.  The two black and white films, Doll Face (Vivian Blaine, Dennis O'Keefe and Perry Como) and If I'm Lucky (new to DVD with Vivian Blaine, Perry Como and Harry James) are not her best efforts, but it will be great to see an authorized version of Doll Face. Up till now we had to tolerate really lousy prints since this film is in the public domain. This set will appeal to those fans of Vivian Blaine, Perry Como and Phil Silvers as well. Let's hope Fox releases the Alice Faye and Betty Grable Collections volume 2!

footnote: In closing, check out Jerry Lewis' impersonation of Carmen Miranda in Scared Stiff and Mickey Rooney's great impersonation in Babes On Broadway. It's all great fun!

update: I received this collection yesterday and the 3 Technicolor films look beautiful. The glorious black & white films never looked better. It's a joy to watch them now. Something For The Boys includes a new, 4-part documentary: ""The Girl From Rio"". Don't hesitate. This collection is a must for all those who enjoy Fox musicals of the 1940s!

3376507,5,B00158K14G,"Fox musicals aren't as well known as the MGM musicals of the 40's and 50's or even the Warner musicals of the 30's. However, they did some pretty good stuff over the years. You have to remember that with these films, as with the MGM films of the same era, that plot is entirely secondary. It is just there to prop up the music and dancing, which are the main events.

The 5 disc DVD set will include:

Greenwich Village (1944) - NEW TO DVD - starring Don Ameche, Vivian Blaine, Carmen Miranda, and William Bendix. Don Ameche is particularly good in his role as a composer. Miranda's numbers include ""Give Me a Band and a Bandana,"" ""I Like to be Loved By You,"" and ""I'm Just Wild About Harry,"" all performed with great energy.
If I'm Lucky  (1946) - NEW TO DVD - Vivian Blaine actually has the starring role in this remake of ""Thanks a Million"". No Technicolor and no real memorable numbers, although it is a pleasant way to pass the time.
Something For the Boys (1944) - NEW TO DVD - Probably the weakest film in the set. Miranda gets top billing, but she gets rather mediocre support, particularly in Perry Como. He is rather wooden in his performance here. Phil Silvers, though, comes off quite well.
Doll Face (1944) - Former Alpha release - Vivian Blaine is a burlesque performer who wants to become a legitimate song and dance gal. This effort to change her act, and the players involved, is the comedy backdrop to the film. Memorable numbers include ""Somebody's Walking in My Dream"", ""Here Come's Heaven Again"" and ""Red, Hot and Beautiful"". Perry Como sings one of his break-through songs ""Dig You Late"". Carmen Miranda performs ""Chico Chico"". Based on a play by Gypsy Rose Lee.
The Gang's All Here (1943) - Released last year and remastered for this set. This is probably the best musical in this set. The story is really there just to boost morale during WWII. There are quite a few good supporting players in this one - lanky Charlotte Greenwood, Edward Everett Hornton, Eugene Pallette, and lending musical support is Benny Goodman and his orchestra. Best of all, Busby Berkeley directs.

Unlike most of Fox's recent releases, such as Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan, this set will release all the films as singles at just under fifteen dollars each. No word on extra features yet.",1204588800,27,2285,4.606879606879607

3376538,4,B00158K14G,"What you get is the Fox films in which Carmen was featured from !943, '44 and '46. Most of her earlier films can be gotten individually and are in the Alice Faye or Betty Grable collections. The two '46 films are in B&W rather than the previous Technicolor that always accompanied Fox films featuring Carmen. This presumably reflected a real or engineeered decline in her Box office appeal and caused Carmen to terminate her Fox contract. There are some extras. as well. Those on  'The Gang's All Here' disc feature the careers of Alice Faye  and Busby Berkeley, while Carmen's story is featued on the  'Something for the Boys' disc.
  One can also think of this collection as 'The Vivian Blaine Collection' or 'The Perry Como Collection', as it includes a good chunk of their rather limited Hollywood careers. The generally acknowledged gem of the collection is 'The Gang's  All Here', in which Busby Berkeley was given free reign as director and choreographer to unleash his surrealistic imagination in a musical extravaganza. Although not the centerpiece of the script, Carmen makes immunerable appearances, in a variety of outlandish outfits, and provides much of the comedic moments.
  To me, 'Something for the Boys' is also a gem, perhaps even more entertaining than 'The Gang's all Here', despite its outrageously daffy story line. With Phil Silvers stealing the show with his humor and penchant to run things, it has the best balance of music and comedy. Screen time is well divided between the multiple stars, including Vivian, Perry and leading man Michael O'Shea. The stars all had great chemistry with each other, starting off with sequential renditions  of the song 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could fall in love'. Carmen leads several production numbers. This film demonstrates what a great comedy team Carmen and Phil could have made. Some have characterized Vivian as the poor man's Betty Grable or Alice Faye, but I thought she sparkled in this film and in 'Greenwich Village', the other '44 Technicolor film in this collection.
  'Greenwich Village', although prominently  displaying Carmen in various roles, suffers somewhat in comparison as entertainment from the lack of Phil Silvers and from a too serious staid  Don Ameche. It's not without interest, however.  Vivian is radiant in her first starring role, although she and Ameche seem miscast as apparently highbrow entertainers associated with William Bendix's dive. You get the typical Bendix of the later TV series 'The Life of Riley'. His chief asset as a comedic actor was his distinctive exaggerated takes. Tony and Sally de Marco return from 'The Gang's All Here' to do a brief dance routine. The Four Step Brothers was an all African American group. I counted at least 8, not 4. They put on an entertaining band-dance routine, including acrobatic dancing, similar to that of the Nicholas Brothers, featured in several other Fox musicals of this period.
  Now for the two B&W films. You might wonder how Carmen could possibly go over well without color. Well, in 'If I'm Lucky', she and her entourage emphazized striking B&W outfits. Color wasn't everything about Carmen! Vivian's hair was also changed from Technicolor reddish to blond, for greater contrast. This is a remake of the '30s film 'Thanks a Million'. I haven't seen the original, but some reviewers prefer it. The same 4 stars of 'Something for the Boys' return. Also, Harry James and his band make a significant presence. Unlike his film debut, Perry Como is the leading man in this one. Unfortunately, this means he is given too much screen time for many people, who find his persona too bland. Depends what you are in the mood for. Phil and Carmen again team up for much of the somewhat muted comedy, and Phil again wants to run everyone's business. However, perhaps the funniest scene is Perry's unlikely exposing of the corrupt political machine leaders backing him, in a campaign speech. Edgar Buchanan is another well recognized presence, being perfectly cast as the drunkard political blowhard whom Perry replaces as the puppet for the political machine.
  Carmen is least prominent in 'Doll Face', the story of which was inspired by Gypsy Rose Lee. Although she appears briefly from time to time, she's not really important to the story. She has one production number, called 'Chico Chico, from Puerto Rico'. Unfortunely, her performance with a lighthouse on her head was deleted, although viewable as a special feature. Unlike the other films, she had no comedic male counterpart she could give and take with. Thus, this is strictly a musical, not a musical comedy. That is its greatest shortcoming, since the ballads, while generally OK for romantic slow dancing, are generally not of the memorable class. Also,  rather drab melodrama, rather than humor, tends to fill in the time between musical numbers. Perry Como again is featured. I counted 6 songs he sings, sometimes accompanied with dancing girls, sometimes to or with Vivian or Martha Stewart. The classic 'Hubba Hubba Hubba'is the only lively tune, he does with Martha Stewart. Perhaps more than any other song, it expresses the jubilation over the recent conclusion of WW II, thumbing their noses at the defeated Japanese, and telling the servicemen to go home, have some frivilous fun, find a girl to marry and get ready for a bright future. The expression 'Hubba, Hubba' generally was used to express interest in someone of the opposite sex, like a wolf whistle, or to denote excitement about something. In the context of this song, both usages are relevant.
  Carmen is still recognized as a one-of-a-kind entertainer, not only for her outrageous self-designed costumes, rapid fire nonsensical verbiage and sinuous dancing, but for her very expressive face and eyes and comedic talent. Of course, she was the subject of frequent humerous imitations, from Mickey Rooney to Lucille Ball on film. It's a shame her comedic talents weren't utilized to a much greater extent, both by Hollywood and on early TV. Can you imagine her as a regular on The Phil Silver's Show or I Love Lucy? Unfortunely, her hectic performance schedule, problems with studios, and disasterous marriage caused her to turn to drugs to cope, contributing to a relatively early death.",1282953600,,6271,5.027965284474446
3376539,4,B00158K14G,"Carmen Miranda is at her funniest in these films, it's just a shame  that the only film in the bunch that's really top notch, is The Gangs all Here, which is also part of the Alice Faye collection, still it's worth having for an occasional viewing of the highly talanted Carmen Miranda",1278806400,,285,4.480769230769231
3376540,5,B00158K14G,"The Carmen Miranda Collection has five films: The Gang's All Here; If I'm Lucky; Something for the Boys; Greenwich Village and Doll Face. This box set is a must-have for any Carmen Miranda fan; and the DVDs have wonderful bonus features. Here's a list of the films and what you can expect:

The Gang's All Here----The Gang's All Here is a stunning musical thanks to the talents of Busby Berkeley, Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda. The musical numbers directed by Busby Berkeley impress me as some of his finest work.

Andy Mason (James Ellison), an army man during World War II, meets Edie Allen (Alice Faye), a showgirl at a nightclub. Andy falls for Edie almost immediately; and Edie finally returns Andy's affections. What Edie doesn't know is that Andy is expected to marry Vivian Potter (Sheila Ryan). Thus Andy lets Edie think his name is Casey so things won't get jumbled. Andy returns a decorated war hero--and Edie's become a star in the show. Complications immediately arise when Andy has to manage the problem that he's promised himself to two girls--Edie and Vivian.

Look for Carmen Miranda as Dorita, Edie's friend who also works in the nightclub; Carmen's ""The Lady In The Tutti Frutti Hat"" number is outrageously fun. Edward Everett Horton and Charlotte Greenwood give outstanding performances as Vivian's parents Peyton Potter and his wife Blossom--and boy, can Charlotte Greenwood dance! Benny Goodman plays himself as the bandleader in the club; and Benny's real life orchestra play themselves in this movie.

The choreography can't be better--this is a Busby Berkeley musical, after all. The cinematography also reflects Busby's genius. In addition, the DVD comes with a commentary by Drew Casper and there's an Alice Faye short film entitled We Still Are.

If I'm Lucky----If I'm Lucky is good for a few laughs and you get great song and dance numbers. Carmen Miranda steals the show with her singing and dancing; and it's wonderful to see Harry James & His Orchestra.

We meet the principle members of a traveling band who are excited about their audition with the Titan Tire Company for its radio show. Linda Farrell (Vivian Blaine) sings; Earl Gordon (Harry James) is the bandleader; Michelle O'Toole (Carmen Miranda) sings, dances and even plays the harp and Wallingham M. 'Wally' Jones (Phil Silvers) essentially manages them all.

After their audition is canceled, they walk around hungry--until they spy a gubernatorial candidate's rally with free food! They join to get hot dogs and beer; and they meet the candidate for governor, Darius J. Magonnagle (Edgar Buchanan). They also meet singer Allen Clark (Perry Como) and they get hired, including Allen, to go with Magonnagle's campaign and provide entertainment.

However, the current governor has his cronies push Magonnagle out of the race so he's not a threat; and they place Allen Clark as a figurehead candidate for governor so they can do as they please. Allen threatens to expose them; but the governor's buddy Marc Dwyer (Frank Fenton) lets Allen know someone will ""take care of him"" if he does. The fact that Allen and Linda have fallen in love makes matters even more complicated.

Something For The Boys----Something For The Boys could have been better; but it could have been worse. The musical numbers are well done--for the most part. This is essentially a light-hearted musical. The choreography impressed me.

Three cousins inherit a dilapidated old Southern plantation. The cousins are street salesman Harry Hart (Phil Silvers), factory worker Chiquita Hart (Miranda) and entertainer Blossom Hart (Vivian Blaine). The three of them go to see the ""estate;"" but they have no money to fix the place up.

However, Sergeant Laddie Green (Perry Como) and Sergeant Rocky Fulton (Michael O'Shea) drive up to inform the cousins that they want to buy the house, fix it up and use it as a boarding house for the wives of some military personnel. The cousins accept; and the wives of the military men put on a show to raise money and make the old place shine.

Rocky and Blossom fall for each other; and that's rough when his fiance Melanie Walker (Sheila Ryan) shows up. Rocky no longer loves Melanie; but Blossom is so upset she won't let Rocky explain. We also see that because of the factory she worked in for so long, Chiquita has carborundum in her teeth that make her a human radio transmitter. (?)

Something For The Boys is a better than average musical with some great moments--but it also moments I'd rather forget. Perry Como sings wonderfully but he can't act. People who like light-hearted classic musicals will enjoy this; and look for the excellent documentary about Carmen, ""The Girl From Rio.""

Greenwich Village----Greenwich Village is a great musical. There are outstanding song and dance numbers all throughout the film; and Carmen gets top billing! The choreography couldn't have been better. Although the artwork indicates that Perry Como performs in this picture, I couldn't find Perry anywhere!

It's 1922 in Greenwich Village, an artistic haven in New York City. Kenneth Harvey (Don Ameche) gets off the bus and he wanders into a village speakeasy owned by Danny O'Mara (William Bendix). Kenneth meets the outrageously fun singer/dancer/ fortune teller Princess Querida (Carmen Miranda). He also lays eyes on Danny's girlfriend Bonnie Watson (Vivian Blaine) who sings there. Danny has feelings for Bonnie; but when Kenneth also begins to have feelings for Bonnie trouble starts.

Kenneth came to the big city to track down ""the great Kavosky"" (Emil Rameau) and have his concerto performed; he wants to be a classical composer. Danny ""lifts"" some of Kenneth's music and puts it into his own upcoming show. Bonnie, who begins to return Kenneth's affection, is opposed to Danny using Kenneth's music.

Greenwich Village easily rivals some of the best MGM musicals out there. These song and dance numbers are quite memorable. The DVD comes with some still photos taken behind the scenes and more.

Doll Face----Doll Face is a fairly good musical. The musical numbers are choreographed very well.

Mary Elizabeth ""Doll Face"" Carroll (Vivian Blaine), a burlesque queen, comes to a Broadway theater with her boyfriend and manager Michael Francis ""Mike"" Hannegan (Dennis O'Keefe). She tries out for Flo Hartman's (Reed Hadley) new operetta called ""Park Avenue;"" but Hartman won't hire her because she's a burlesque queen. Doll Face and Mike are upset--until Mike decides that Doll Face should write a book to prove that she's got class. When Doll Face doubts that she can write a book; Mike says they'll hire a ghost writer and pay him to make it look like Doll Face had written her autobiography.

But trouble starts when ghostwriter Frederick Manly Gerard (Stephen Dunne) sees Doll Face--he falls for her and Mike feels threatened. Mike also gets advice from Chita Chula (Carmen Miranda) who works in Mike's show. After Fred and Doll Face get stuck on the water in a boat when all they wanted was to reach their publisher on a small island, Mike misinterprets this and he dumps Doll Face. She's angry too and romance blossoms between her and Fred. In addition, we get a few extras. There is a deleted scene and the stills gallery is very nicely done.

Doll Face is a ""B"" movie musical that could have been an ""A"" rated film if Fox had given it its due. The musical numbers are pretty good but without color they lacked that certain ""something extra."" However, if you like classic musicals, consider adding this one to your collection.

The Carmen Miranda Collection has five films that may vary in overall quality--but Carmen's performances are invariably flawless. Get this and enjoy Carmen's talent!",1243382400,2,7703,4.99687743950039

The best is certainly GANGS and it looks terrific, here, much better than the earlier transfer in the Alice Faye box. And the transfers are the most certainly the big kick, here. Everything looks really good, probably better than when first released, and that's saying something. These were all three-strip Technicolor. But the digital upgrades are really wonderful looking.

Carmen Miranda is nicely showcased here for fans and neophytes, alike. A couple of the films are somewhat exotic items that don't show up on tv.

I always remembered the Carmen Miranda movies as being funny - only in adult life did I see them as 'camp'.  When I discovered that I was gay, the whole picture fell into place.  Carmen was an extraordinary performer, quite zany but at the same time very entertaining. In retrospect I can see she was not a great actress, but personality and her mad sense of acting was very much of that period.

3376559,5,B00158K14G,"The original coochy-coochy girl was born in a small town in northern Portugal, became a Samba superstar in Brazil, making 10 films there before being whisked off to Broadway by the Brothers Shubert. From New York it was but a short hop to Hollywood and worldwide recognition.
This set preserves the Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat's South American charm and manic energy. Among the gems here are The Gang's All Here, proving that psychedelic color existed way before the '60s; Greenwich Village, with fast peeks at future celebs such as Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Judy Holliday; and Doll Face, based on a script by Louise Hovick, better known as Gypsy Rose Lee.
To be sure, Fox's musicals had neither the edge of Warner Brothers nor the ultra-glamour of Metro, yet for sheer exuberant charm, they can't be beat. Alice Faye, Phil Baker, Don Ameche, William Bendix, Vivian Blaine and Perry Como surround La Miranda in these films, but no one can out shine her. And no one can out ""Chicka-Chicka Boom"" the Brazilian Bombshell.",1217116800,6,1024,4.857142857142857

3376562,5,B00158K14G,"Finally, The Carmen Miranda Collection !!! A wonderful set of films starring the glamorous and talented Carmen Miranda. The set includes several titles not previously released on dvd. Another reviewer complained that some of these titles are not her best film work. But why include films in the set that was released over a year ago? Most Miranda fans already have these titles so why make a collection set with nothing new? I can not praise this collection highly enough. Restored in glorious color and black and white, with plenty of bonuses for everyone to enjoy. Also includes a great documentary film on Mirandas life, before and during her Hollywood days,presented with insight, by co-workers and film and music historians. I salute 20th Century Fox for making this available and to continue releasing other collection... why not Sonja Henie :-)
Again... enjoy The Carmen Miranda Collection. Alot of value for the money!",1216598400,3,926,5.098684210526316

The transfer to DVD is top notch and the colour and sound make you think you are in a movie theatre surrounded by other people being entertained.

Worth every penny. Just sit bacvk and enjoy the fun.",1216166400,2,397,4.642857142857143
3376564,5,B00158K14G,"This is a fab set of old films starring one of Brazil's greatest samba singers, Carmen Miranda.  True, these are not her ""best"" movies, but Hollywood ruined Carmen quickly and once she came to the US, all we ever really got to see were glimpses of her dazzling performing power. As it is, I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who is curious about the Carmen Miranda legend... The first film, ""The Gang's All Here,"" is a frothy collaboration between Carmen and the great choreographer Busby Berkeley, who indulges himself in some wonderful visual gags and inventive tracking shots.  The movie has a playful, giddy tone, and Miranda thrives in it from the first frame until the end. She has great costumes and strong musical numbers, with backing from her ace Brazilian band, Banda Da Lua. This film alone is worth the price of admission.

The other movies aren't on the same level, but they're still fun, particularly if you have a taste for World War Two-era B-movies. (In the burlesque-tinged ""Something For The Boys,"" erstwhile female lead Vivian Blaine actually turns to the male lead and says, hey, the boys have lots of talent, and we've got this big old house -- ""Let's put on a show!"") The Fox studios surrounded Carmen with a cast of regulars that included Vivian Blaine (yawn), Don Ameche, Phil Silvers and Perry Como.  In ""Greenwich Village,"" an affable Ameche shines as an aspiring classical composer who gets caught up in the heady, bohemian art scene, while that lovable lug William Bendix hams it up as a gruff nightclub owner who nonetheless fixes things up so that Ameche can become a star...)

The real draw, of course, is Carmen Miranda, an artist who sizzled like a live wire when she came to the United States in 1939 (if you can, check out the samba records she made before she came here, and you'll hear where her famous charisma started...) and she continued to dazzle whenever given half a chance (check out the shockingly vaginal pink-and-black dress she wore in""Greenwich Village"" - still scandalous after all these years!)  Sadly, Miranda worked herself into an early death, but she also created and kept tight control of her own cannily-crafted public image as a kooky, warm-hearted Latin bombshell, and these movies, even if they have their shortcomings, are still vital parts of her legacy.

Not only are these top-quality prints of vintage movies that have mostly never been on DVD before, the folks at Fox also wisely decided to augment them with archival features such as old TV appearances and movie shorts (including a follow-the-bouncing-ball singalong trailer that was shown in theatres in the 1940s) and, even more wonderful, there is a feature-length documentary tacked onto ""Something For The Boys"" that profiles Carmen Miranda's career, from her early years in Brazil to the meteoric rise and slow fizzle of her Hollywood career. The doc includes thoughtful, insightful commentary by numerous Brazilian and American film scholars, journalists and Carmen Miranda mavens -- and LOTS of cool archival footage from throughout Miranda's career.  Definitely worth checking out.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)",1214179200,6,3175,5.020912547528517
3376565,3,B00158K14G,"It's nice that Carmen Miranda is getting her own DVD collection, but with the exception of the re-mastered version of The Gang's All Here, her best films are already available individually (Week-end in Havana) and as part of the Betty Grable (Down Argentine Way) and Alice Faye (That Night in Rio) collections (they're also sold individually).  The best of her other films at Fox, Springtime in the Rockies, is not included here. Her co-star in her last four films at Fox was Vivian Blaine, ""the cherry blonde,"" who never really made it as a movie musical star.  And the films are significantly less good than Carmen's first ones. By that point, she had become a self-parody, and her films put her in unimaginative musical numbers with bad songs and ridiculously over-the-top costumes.  By her last two films (Doll Face, If I'm Lucky), Carmen had been downgraded to black-and-white musicals and she bought out her contract.  Since the re-mastered Gang's All Here will be sold alone, then I would only recommend this collection for die-hard fans of Carmen Miranda or Fox musicals.",1206748800,39,1079,4.94475138121547
3376566,5,B00158K14G,"Carmen Miranda was rarely the star of those wonderful 1940s musicals at 20th Century Fox, but whenever she was on screen, you couldn't take your eyes off her. Most of her great performances have already been released with the Alice Faye and Betty Grable Collections, but there are still plenty of reasons to rejoice with this collection.

Busby Berkeley's The Gang's All Here (her best film) is going to be re-mastered for this collection with the same extras as in the Alice Faye Collection. The other two Technicolor treats in this set are Greenwich Village (with Don Ameche and Vivian Blaine) and Something For The Boys (Vivian Blaine and Perry Como). Both are new to DVD. If you enjoy Carmen Miranda, you will not be disappointed with all three of the Technicolor musicals in this box set.  The two black and white films, Doll Face (Vivian Blaine, Dennis O'Keefe and Perry Como) and If I'm Lucky (new to DVD with Vivian Blaine, Perry Como and Harry James) are not her best efforts, but it will be great to see an authorized version of Doll Face. Up till now we had to tolerate really lousy prints since this film is in the public domain. This set will appeal to those fans of Vivian Blaine, Perry Como and Phil Silvers as well. Let's hope Fox releases the Alice Faye and Betty Grable Collections volume 2!

footnote: In closing, check out Jerry Lewis' impersonation of Carmen Miranda in Scared Stiff and Mickey Rooney's great impersonation in Babes On Broadway. It's all great fun!

update: I received this collection yesterday and the 3 Technicolor films look beautiful. The glorious black & white films never looked better. It's a joy to watch them now. Something For The Boys includes a new, 4-part documentary: ""The Girl From Rio"". Don't hesitate. This collection is a must for all those who enjoy Fox musicals of the 1940s!

8257887,5,B00158K14G,"This is just a great set of DVD videos if you are fascinated by the larger than life personality of the Brazilian singer-dancer, Carmen Miranda.
The films are all 20th Century Fox releases from the World War II Era, and include perhaps the only Busby Berkely staged and directed in color.
The Technicolor features, ""The Gang's All Here"" and ""Grenich Village"" are the stand-outs in the set, but ""Doll Face"" is also a good story. Nearly all of the features are Fox formula pictures with a ""back stage"" story line to accommodate their musical reviews.  If I'm Lucky is a pretty campy political drama in black and white, but featuring some good songs by Perry Como.  Phil Silvers, like Como, Vivian Blaine, and Carmen Miranda, were all apparently under contract to Fox at the time and appear in most of the musical films.  Phil Silvers always adds a burlesque comedy element to the story lines. Somethng For The Boys is also in Technicolor but is almost a World War Two patriotic propaganda musical, now very dated, but probably appropriate to the times.  All of the DVD's in the box set are great musical diversion, and all were conceived to feature the
show-stopping Carmen Miranda in a musical review or two.  While the story lines seem dated and overly studio formula, the music still holds up and can be enjoyed today.  One of the DVD's features an excellent three-part documentary about the origins and short life of Carmen Miranda.",1501372800,,1434,4.762096774193548
