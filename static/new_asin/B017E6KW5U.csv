7504557,4,B017E6KW5U,"This anthology of PPV matches throughout the year series returns after last years edition was an international exclusive & no different than the previous collections, WWE wants to put this collection out before the end of the year so matches from the Survivor Series & T.L.C. events are not included. As a side note, there isn't a Blu-Ray version due to the low sales of the previous editions while highlights from each PPV event would be shown throughout the presentation.

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that the crowd was very creative with their John Cena chants during his entrance that gave me flashbacks to when Kurt Angle used to come to the ring. This match was filled with various highlights such as Brock german suplexing anything in sight repeatedly throughout the match weather it was each individual or two at the same time including the first two in the opening seconds or the one that had a nasty landing for one of the opponents, an unlikely alliance made to take out the biggest threat in the match, Seth's aerial assault that even at one point took out both opponents at the same time along with the amazing way he was eventually caught in mid-air & one move he did later on that I don't recall seeing from him in WWE, action spilling to the outside with the ringside environment coming into play including one move that finally eliminated one of the opponents for several minutes, and various counters & reversals to trademark offense. This was definitely the first ""match of the year"" candidate & match of the night.
Royal Rumble

Roman Reigns vs. Daniel Bryan - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliever a hard shot of their own on more than one occassion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""
Fastlane
[Daniel Bryan: Just Say YES! YES! YES!]

United States Champion Rusev vs. John Cena - Lana was in Rusev's corner for the first time in weeks while Rusev had quite the entrance as he was dominate early with various kicks & power offense along with even trying to embarrass Cena at one point as he was able to just keep countering & stay in control stopping Cena dead whenever he amounted some amount offense before both men were able to start trading momentum countering each other's power moves & submissions along with each man executing offense that we've never seen from them with it coming down to a strategy that worked in their previous match backfiring on this occasion as it was a solid match but I enjoyed their previous match better.
WrestleMania 31

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns - Brock powered Reigns into the corner followed by a suplex & F5 all in the first 30 seconds before he kept working him over with what Brock himself called ""Suplex City B..."" as Brock made it clear he was out to punish Reigns more than beat him such as suplexing him out of the ring only to suplex him back in only for Reigns to be bleeding from the mouth but laughing at the beating he was taking only to keep kicking out & giving back the punishment to the point where Brock was bleeding before it came down to one man taking advantage of the opportunity when it presented itself...just nobody expected WHO it was that took advantage. This match told a good story of Brock continuing to be the most dominate performer today while showing Reigns being so tough in not only taking a beating but delivering it right back while the ultimate winner showcased he was the smartest & an opportunist.
WrestleMania 31

Tag Team Champions Tyson Kidd & Cesaro vs. New Day - Kofi Kingston & Big E represented The New Day in this match with the champions taking control playing to their strengths with Kidd using his superior quickness & wrestling ability & Cesaro showcasing his strength including how was caught Big E in mid-air without buckling or having to balance himself while using their opponent's own momentum against them causing New Day to attempt to single out one member & work him over in their half of the ring as both teams traded momentum through double team combinations & some impactful offense from a spear through the ropes to the deadlift superplex with even Woods & Natayla at ringside making their presence felt in what was a great match.
Extreme Rules

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Randy Orton - The special stipulation for this match was that Kane would be fired from The Authority if Seth Rollins didn't retain his championship. This match started off with a bang as you saw a series of back to back dives outside of the ring in the opening minute as the match was non-stop action with various highlights such as different unlikely alliances being formed between the competitors including a reunion a year in the making, the ringside environment coming into play on different occasions, series of hitting their signature moves & countering others, and the biggest story of the match being what was the most important to Kane in a great & physical main event filled from everyone involved.
Payback

Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Tag Team Champions New Day vs. Prime Time Players vs. Lucha Dragons vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd vs. Los Matadores vs. The Ascension - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that tag teams were participants. Various highlights include various high flying maneuvers executed from various spots of the chamber from the top of the pods to off the top of the roof, one man climbing around the chamber like he was Spiderman, one team trying to get involved in the action before they were legal in the match making them the odd team out, and how more than one team had a ""numbers advantage"" over the others. This was a really good Chamber match with lots of crazy spots & some teams looking better than they had been in a very long time.
Elimination Chamber

John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - A rare ""champion vs. champion"" match as Owens was in control early staying one step ahead of Cena having counters to his offense & delivering some impactful moves of his own while continuing to taunt him whenever possible before Cena was able to take advantage of an opening as they traded momentum with Owens attempting Cena's own offense against him while Cena hit some impactful offense from different areas such as the top rope to a springboard position`with a finish that definitely shocked the world as this was the type of performance that makes a superstar & impact which it did for Kevin Owens in his WWE PPV debut as he was able to pull out the performance from Cena that pushed him to the limit.
Elimination Chamber

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Neville vs. Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Sheamus vs. Kane - You knew the direction this was going when everyone went for the ladders early as there were plenty of highlights including one man constantly trying to find a way to sneak past the other participants up the ladder, a powerbomb onto a ladder only for another man to be powerbombed onto that same person on top of the ladder, RKO's ""outta nowhere"" onto anyone in sight, the ""altitude era"" coming into effect, one man doing a ""crash & burn"" more than once, bodies flying over the top rope onto a pile of others, and others who got involved in the match as well in a match that you got what's expected from it in terms of spots involving individuals & groups of competitors.
Money In The Bank

Ladder Match: WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose - Both men started out brawling right from the start with the ladder coming into play throughout the match using it in different ways such as executing moves onto it to blocking their opponents offense using it while just using it recklessly in other cases such as such launching it towards their opponent with other weapons used as well such as the steps & chairs to the announce table & barricades around ringside as this fight even went into the crowd at one point as both men used different strategies against the other such as using the weapons to focus on a specific body part to just trying to create enough distance & obstacles away from the ring so they could climb without interruption as this overall was a ladder match that was a very physical fight from start to finish that literally came down to the last second.
Money In The Bank

Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Brie Bella - The ""divas revolution"" that started a week earlier resulted in this match with a candidate from each team meeting here in this match that definitely had some highlights such as a ""like father, like daughter"" moment with Charlotte only to be topped later with a ""like husband, like wife"" series of offense from Brie and the double stomp in the corner by Sasha that had a domino effect on her opponents as the main strategy here was that one diva was the odd woman out attempting to take her out of the contest so the other two can concentrate on each other along with the other divas at ringside getting caught up in the action as well in a good match between all three with the NXT girls only scratching the surface of what they're capable of doing causing Brie to step up her game in her best performance in recent memory.
Battleground

United States Champion John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - This was the rubber match with the difference being that Owens is no longer the NXT Champion while Cena was defending his title with Owens coming out strong with a knockout punch & torture rack neckbreaker while Cena had a unique faceplant slam & top rope legdrop as both men traded momentum countering & blocking the other's offense with one man stealing the other's moveset at one point as they continued to have innovative combinations or counters rarely seen from each other before such as a superplex countered into a mid-air side suplex or powerbomb into a rana in such a hard fought match that you saw both men show signs of frustration thinking ""what else can I do?"" in what was another show stealing performance from both men in these series of match.
Battleground

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar - Brock came out aggressive before the match started only for Taker to send him to the outside as Brock heavily worked over the midsection while sending Taker to ""Suplex City"" only for Taker to rebound with some his trademark offense causing Brock to bleed over his eye as the match got more physical with both men trading punches on more than one occasion & playing the same mind games on each other plus a body going through a table while Brock delivered more suplexes & Taker executed more of his signature moves with both men also going for submissions on more than one occasion with one man eventually getting caught & showing the ultimate act of defiance in the process as this was a better overall contest than their previous WrestleMania encounter as Taker was more physical & aggressive while Brock continued to be the dominate beast that he's known for with again the only negative thing being the ending to the match depending on how you want to look at it.
SummerSlam

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Charlotte - Nikki broke the record for the longest reigning Divas Champion (another story for another time) earlier in the week through tactics that caused this match to be where she lost her champions advantage by being able to lose the title on a disqualification or count out. Charlotte had the early advantage before Nikki was able to take advantage of an opening working over her knee relentlessly using the environment around her from the bottom ring rope to ring post while using Charlotte's & her own weight along with submissions in what was without a doubt the best performance from Nikki Bella as champion being a dominate heel here & telling the story of being completely ruthless in working over an area of the body but also conscience of not trying to get unintentionally disqualified.
Night Of Champions

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Sting - Seth's own attitude & actions after his previous match caused Cena to react in a way that left him at even more of a disadvantage coming into this encounter with Sting capitalizing right away both in & outside of the ring until Seth was able to catch a break & realize that he had Sting where he wanted him heavily working over an area of Sting's body with Sting coming back including taking some high risk moves to the outside before one impactful move directly to that area caused Sting intense pain that he tried to fight through but was clear that he was seriously injured in what was definitely Sting's best performance dating back to the last year of his run in TNA with the bigger story being the aftermath of one man following up on his guarantee to follow up on this opportunity while another came for unfinished business.
Night Of Champions

Hell In A Cell Match: Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar - This was set to be their final encounter & before I get started for those who like trivia, it should be noted that the announcers did acknowledge that Brock won his only other previous Hell In A Cell match but didn't state that it was against Undertaker over a decade ago making this the third time (technically) in history that there's been a Hell In A Cell rematch. Brock started out taking the match to Taker right away attacking the midsection to punches & knees & shoulderblocks in the corner with Taker sending Brock to the outside using the ringside environment inside the cell to making him bleed in the opening moments only for Brock to introduce a weapon that resulted in Taker bleeding from his head as they traded momentum using the same weapons & tactics against each other along with Brock taking Taker to ""Suplex City"" destroying anyone & anything in the process while Taker continued to take advantage of his surroundings & use his trademark offense to wear Brock down in a match that lived up to the hype of their series with the only negative being the aftermath (depending on how you want to look at it).
Hell In A Cell

Now I know that there isn't enough room to get every single quality match from the year but some of the choices were very questionable for this being a ""Best Of"" as certain matches were picked in favor of some that were better quality or more significant while this was the first year we've seen rematches on the same set but we still got some of the best encounters from the year so overall this is no different than the previous years in that this is a collection for those who those who have enjoyed WWE this year but obviously are unable to watch/collect most of the PPV's.",1447891200,4,15432,4.63244428206065
