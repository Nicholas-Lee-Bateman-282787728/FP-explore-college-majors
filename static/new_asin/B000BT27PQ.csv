8324050,4,B000BT27PQ,"I remember this film from Avid Camp a few years ago.  It's got some funny stuff in it.  It was picked for Avid Camp because it was shot on DV.  It was transferred to 35mm and ran in some French film festival.  It was a good use of DV, somebody really knew their lighting.",1139270400,2,271,3.962962962962963
8324051,4,B000BT27PQ,"Often quite funny, I actually laughed out loud watching by myself (which I never do).  The cast includes some familiar faces but no stars or names. A little too racy for younger kids, probably deserved an R-rating.",1139097600,2,214,4.783783783783784
