1971531,3,B00015GA8A,"What a disappointment is Series 2 of Granada Televison's production of ""The Forsyte Saga"", based upon John Galsworthy's novel ""To Let."" Again, it is as though the producers and writers at Granada never read more than an outline of Galworthy's complex and richly detailed works. This time they were not content to make minor alterations to the plot....no, only a meat cleaver was good enough for the writers who adapted ""To Let"" for the screen. The film opens with a scene that never took place in the novel, where pre-teens Jon Forsyte (son of Young Jolyn & Irene) and Fleur (daughter of Soames and Annette) meet and are instantly fast friends, in the way that children do. Seeing his daughter and the son of Jolyn & Irene (his sworn enemies) playing in the garden turns Soames into a raving monster who in his rage almost strikes Jon. Damian Lewis as Soames frequently appears to be foaming at the mouth when ever he becomes angry...the scenery must have been in constant danger during the filming of this production. Other equally strange liberties were taken with the book, including Jon and Fleur making love right after his father's funeral, and a reconciliation of sorts between Soames and Irene that concludes Series 2 and which never happened in the books.
Now, as to the more positive aspects of the production: Gena McKee was not nearly as annoying as the middle aged Irene as she was in Series 1, when she was supposed to be a young woman possessing a fatal beauty that attracted all men into her orbit. Her character was warmer and more sympathetic than in the first series. Rupert Graves was an excellent Young Jolyn, wise, loving, and scared of what would happen to his family upon his death. I thought Emma Griffiths Malin was a more-than-adequate Fleur, although she could not quite get the same subtle emotions across as did Susan Hampshire in the 1969 production of ""To Let."" The character of Michael Mont was as charming and appealing in this version as it was in the original, but Lee Williams as Jon left much to be desired IMO, somewhat due to his too youthful appearance.
 This series gave us more insight into the relationship between Soames and Annette than did the original production, which was one case of the new series being more faithful to the book than was the 1969 version, where Annette simply disappeared never to be seen again after her relationship with Profond was discovered. However, that alone cannot make up for a deeply flawed script and the over-the-top acting of Damien Lewis. I really feel Mr Lewis could have benefited by watching the original Soames, the great Eric Porter, who had most viewers eating out of his hand by the end of the 26 episodes of the 1969 series. I hardly think that will be the case here.",1083369600,10,2759,4.712215320910973
1971532,3,B00015GA8A,"Unlike other viewers, I don't mind when TV and movie adaptations are different from the books they are based on. As long as the CHARACTERS are not completely unrecognizable!
Jon and Fleur are presented as Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers. They weren't. In the books, it's made clear that like her father, Fleur is too selfish and possessive to be happy. Jon had doubts about her even before Soames came by and wrecked it.
A few points that they got completely wrong:
June did not hate Fleur. She felt rather sorry for the girl. In fact, June visited Fleur on her wedding day to wish her luck.
Jon left the country to get on with his life after breaking off with Fleur. He did NOT wait around pining, or try to stop her from marrying Michael out of possessiveness. In fact, he sent her a letter with good wishes. Fleur held on to Jon's memory obsessively.
Soames would NEVER have told Fleur about his rape of Irene. He was a Victorian. Not only would he not have spoken to his daughter about sexual matters, he never thought that he had done anything wrong. Irene was his wife back then, so it wasn't rape.
Soames did not make peace with Irene directly. She left the country a few weeks after Fleur's wedding. They saw one another and she waved goodbye.
A few points they got right.
Fleur's ""having nature"". Annette's observation that Soames was ruining their daughter was right on the mark. I enjoyed Annette's characterization. The book shows very little of her interacting with her daughter.
The scene with Soames and Irene. Some people complained about that. But the fact is, for the rest of his life, Soames continued to think of Irene as the cause of all his troubles.
Fleur's hysteria when she realized that Jon was not coming to her. No, she didn't make a scene at Robin Hill in the original. When Soames came back home and told her that Jon had told him that it was ""no good"", she screamed at HIM, telling him that he had betrayed her. (Because for the first time in her life, Soames had failed to give her exactly what she wanted. It never occurred to her that he simply couldn't.)",1083369600,9,2095,4.515789473684211
1971533,4,B00015GA8A,"Those familiar with the first ""Forsyte Saga"" needs no introduction to ""Forsyte Saga: To Let"" which is based on John Galsworthy's novel.  I admit that I have not read Galsworthy's novel but I certainly enjoyed this series as well as series 1.  I will then review this dvd based on its own merit and without making comparisons to the novel.
One of the major strengths of ""To Let"" is that it doesn't depend on ""Forsyte Saga Series 1"" (which I shall refer to ""Series 1"" hereafter) for audiences to understand and embrace it.  Familiarity with the characters of Series 1 certainly helps but a novice will take no time in getting absorbed with the story as it unfolds.  The strength of the screenplay is that it doesn't talk down to the audience but it also takes its time in introducing (or re-introducing) the varied characters from Series 1 (as well as a few newcomers).
Soames and Annette Forsyte's daughter, Fleur, is now an indulged, strong-willed yet charming young woman.  Young Jolyon and Irene Forsyte's son, Jon, is now a handsome, sensitive and artistic young man.  The two meet and fall madly in love - much to the dismay and disapproval of their parents.  ""To Let"" centers on these young lovers as well as the dramatic lives of their affluent and proud families - Soames' long-standing feud with Jolyon and Irene; Soames and Annette's strained relationship; Annette and her sister-in-law Winifred's fascination with the Belgian playboy Prosper Prufond; and the dynamics of these relationships make for a compelling viewing.
Like its predecessor, ""To Let"" possesses the high production values, fabulous locations, excellent acting and compelling storyline that made Series 1 a hit with fans.  Though produced by ITV, it has all the excellent production values that you would expect from a BBC series.  Rupert Graves (Young Jolyon), Gina McKee (Irene) and Damian Lewis (Soames) continue their excellent work from Series 1.  New additions Emma Griffiths Malin (Fleur) and Lee Williams (adorable as Jon) turn in pitch perfect performances as the young lovers.  I disagree with an earlier review that classifies Fleur as a ""spoiled brat, completely selfish and incredibly manipulative.""  On the contrary, I found Fleur to be rather likeable, sweet and even sympathetic.  She is ultimately a resourceful young woman who knows what she wants and goes for it.  She is also very much in love with Jon.  I also enjoyed the casting of Oliver Milburn (Michael Mont) whom I admired as Angel Clare in the equally excellent tv series ""Tess of D'Urbervilles"" (starring Justine Waddell).  One of the great advantages of Series 2 is the return of all of the principal actors from Series 1 (including Amanda Root as Winifred, Ben Miles as Montague Dartie and Julian Ovenden as Val Dartie).
In short, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys excellent British drama.  ""To Let"" is an engrossing British soap opera based on the 1920's that deals with such universal themes of love, hate, forgiveness, greed, passion and possession.  I would rate the series 5-stars but only give 4-stars due to the lack of dvd special features.",1079308800,7,3120,4.967307692307692
1971534,2,B00015GA8A,"Once again I must compare the acting and directing of this new version of the Saga with the original version of 1969. ALL of the characters in the new version are miscast. Soames is portrayed as too mean and too wooden. Young Jo is too young and uncharacteristically cruel. Irene is listless and wimpy. But the most jarring note is Fleur. She is portrayed as a spoiled brat,completely selfish and incredibly manipulative. Galsworthy's Fleur was no angel,but she had qualities of brightness and kindness as well. She also realizes that she is possessive and tells Michael so soon after they are married. However,the most jarring note of this production is the production itself. Part 1 departed greatly from the books to the detriment of the story. But Part 2 exceeds even that:it flings Galsworthy's narrative to the ground and dances upon it! Examples:Young Jo would NEVER go to Fleur,whom he mistrusts,and reveal the secret of his fatal illness. Irene would never scream at Jon and have an hysterical episode. Jon is too innocent to have sex with Fleur after his father's funeral. Soames would sooner die than tell Fleur about his dishonoring Irene. And Fleur would not turn into a screaming harpy when she loses Jon. Then:Soames and Irene patching it up and he leaving Robin Hill with a smile on his face and a spring in his step?PLEASE!The story is set in 1920,a different world from our own. The world portrayed is 2002,and it just doesn't wash. The original 1969 version got a huge audience from it's faithful adaptation and inspired acting. The new 2002 version has to rely on sex and violence to attract an audience. It seems that you can never go broke underestimating the taste of today's viewing public. If you want to own an outstanding version of the Saga,buy the dvd or video set of the original 1969 version. It's still available for purchase on Amazon.",1078963200,23,1868,4.822429906542056
1971535,5,B00015GA8A,"Without set expectations (having neither read the book nor seen the old miniseries), I found this to be very satisfying drama. In fact, I think I like this follow-up even more than I liked the first part, maybe because the love story is more modern. It's not the Victorian era any more, it's the 1920s. It was a time of enormous change, and that's something that this story highlights (with more gorgeous settings and costumes). Everything was loosening up, including sex (even though I expect there was plenty of sex outside marriage in the Victorian era, too, just maybe not in broad daylight). As a doting father, Soames is more sympathetic, more complex, and ultimately more human. I found the last scene very moving, but I was sorry that it was over.",1077667200,3,755,4.7272727272727275
1971536,1,B00015GA8A,"While Series 1 of this production was a simplified but, on the whole, faithful adaptation of Galsworthy's ""Forsyte Saga"", this is something else--and much worse.
So, OK, forget about Galsworthy (obviously the screenwriters did).  Let's pretend it's an original screenplay; is it any good?  The answer is still a resounding ""NO!""  This is one of the shoddiest mishmashes ever put on PBS.
There are many completely unrealistic scenes, here's my favorite example:  Young Jolyon, who despises Fleur, goes to visit his son, Jon, in a cottage.  Presumably to his surprise, he finds Fleur shacked up with Jon.  What's his reaction?  ""Here, let me show you how to cook this cabbage.""  He then goes on to tell Fleur (remember, he hates her and thinks she's completely untrustworthy) his big secret, which he hasn't told his wife or his son, that he's dying!  Makes a lot of sense, huh?
Character development, plot, script continuity are all thrown out the window.  We watched the whole thing the way you would watch a trainwreck.  We couldn't tear ourselves away from such a disaster.  But there's no way I'd ever want to see it again!",1077580800,15,1126,4.868421052631579
1971537,1,B00015GA8A,"The recent dramatization of the ""Forsyte Saga,"" and especially Part 2, makes it obvious that people who produce films for TV these days have a very low opinion of the audience. If you don't fill the thing with sex and violence, no one will watch it. There are people who dispute whether Galsworthy should have gotten the Nobel Prize for literature, but no one ever disputed the fact that he could turn out a good story, and his Forsyte novels had plenty of sex and violence simmering beneath the surface. The original ""Forsyte Saga"" has all the elements of a good old-fashioned page-turner, so why leave most of it out and invent material that is 100% worse than what Galsworthy wrote in the first place?
""The Forsyte Saga"" Part 1 suffered from a poor adaptation to the screen, serious miscasting of the main characters, and tatty costumes and sets. ""The Forsyte Saga,"" Part 2, is worse. Apparently the writers felt that no one in the 21st century could possibly accept the chaste romance between Jon and Fleur Forsyte, so they heated it up for the modern viewer, while making nonsense of Galsworthy's story. In the novels, Jon Forsyte was such an innocent and idealist that he confounded the self-centered and possessive Fleur. In this film, however, he has sex with Fleur (on the day of his father's funeral service, no less!), then breaks off his relationship because he wants to honor his dead father's wishes. Where is the innocent idealist now? And Fleur, whose main faults were being spoiled, possessive, and calculating, pursues Jon relentlessly and entices him into a sexual relationship to catch him once and for all. It's no wonder that this Fleur, when faced with rejection, ends up bawling like a wounded cow on the lawn at Robin Hill. If an author can be made to turn in his grave, Galsworthy must certainly have been spinning then!
But why stop there? Why turn Young Jolyon from a long-suffering monument to tolerance, whose family's indecision put him into the grave, into a tottering old fool who chews up the carpet in nearly every scene? Why is Soames Forsyte's devotion to his only daughter presented as faintly incestuous? Why does Soames have to nearly rape Irene for a second time, then more or less reconcile with her at the end and leave Robin Hill with a jaunty stride and a satisfied smile? Whose story is this anyhow?
It's almost impossible to evaluate the acting in the film because  the tasteless story defeats the actors from the beginning. However, no one seems to age appropriately in the 20 years between Part 1 and Part 2 except Young Jolyon (Rupert Graves), who looks like a little boy playing dress-up in his grandfather's clothes. Emma Griffiths Malin does her best with the role of Fleur, but looks much too mature in comparison with Lee Williams as a very youthful Jon. Damien Lewis's Soames still looks as if he is about to suffer an apoplexy at any moment. Gina McKee is more convincing as the older Irene than in Part 1, but most of what she says and does has no relationship to the novels. Oliver Milburn makes an attractive Michael Mont, but his role is so abbreviated that it is a mystery why Fleur would think to turn to him on the rebound from Jon.
If you want to experience ""The Forsyte Saga"" at its best, you should read the novels, at least the first trilogy, which forms the basis for the 2 parts of this TV adaptation. If you'd rather watch the story on TV, get the original 1967 BBC series, which, despite its dated production values and not being shot in color, is faithful to Galsworthy's story and presents a compelling, well-acted drama.
If you really want to see this version of ""The Forsyte Saga,"" do yourself a favor and rent it. These films are not ""keepers.""",1077494400,24,3721,4.6636225266362255
1971538,1,B00015GA8A,"I disliked Series One of the new FORSYTE SAGA for many reasons, but I'll try to be fair to Series Two (the story of Jon and Fleur).  First let me say the things I liked about Part Two of the series:

-- The actors playing Jon & Fleur are good actors -- with the exception of Fleur's ""screaming scene"" at Robin Hill after she and Soames go there, and she's rejected finally by Jon.  I almost have to let that pass because this embarrassingly melodramatic scene is really the director and the script's fault, not the actress's.  I admit I only kept watching Part 2 because these actors were so attractive together.  The actor who played Michael Mont was good too, although they didn't give him much depth to work with.

-- I did like the scene where, in the last few minutes before Fleur's wedding, when Soames confesses to her about what he did during his marriage to Irene, and how painful it is to him that Irene should only remember that whenever she looks at him.  (This is not in the book, and never would have happened in the original
-- Soames Forsyte, talk with his daughter about what he did in his prior marriage?  But it's a tightly written, restrained emotional scene, and Damien Lewis played it well.)

And THAT'S ABOUT IT.  There is SO much wrong with this adaptation
-- not following Galsworthy's book more faithfully, for one.  To deviate from the original story, in so many important respects.  Like, Jon & Fleur having sex?  How 21st century -- but not in 1921.  And especially having sex, AFTER the revelation of what happened between Soames and Irene?  There is so much that's GOOD in Galsworthy's Forsyte novels -- why did the writer(s) of this TV dramatization think they could ""improve"" on them?

The Prosper Profond character, a minor character in To Let, here is blown up into someone who interferes in most of the character's lives.  The miscasting of Gina McKee as Irene is another (continued) fault and a continuing major flaw.  She looked even less beautiful ""old"", than she did young.

Then there's the fact that the writers turned the character of ""Young"" Jolyon into this strident, yelling, negative force, instead of the quietly tolerant, thoughtful character he really is.  There's the fact that no one told Damien Lewis that not moving his arms when he walks makes him look like a zombie.  I know he was trying to show Soames as a repressed Victorian fortress of a man, but... Generally I love Damien Lewis's acting ability, but I don't know if his playing Soames Forsyte was miscasting, or I'll just be generous to him and say, since the director, writers and producer of this series basically got everything else wrong, their take on Soames was wrong too, and he had to follow their lead.

If I hadn't read the original novels, would I have enjoyed this series?  Probably, yes, I might have (except for the really over-the-top scenes).  If I wasn't aware of how good the original novels are, and how dishonest this adaptation is to Galsworthy, AND to the times in which it's set, I might have enjoyed it.  In a chick-lit soap-opera sorta way, I guess.

I'm guessing the producers are NOT going to film the remaining Forsythe novels, since they've already showed Jon & Fleur having sex, and Irene & Soames shook hands at the end, so they have nothing else to dramatize.  Thank God for small blessings!  Or will we get a Fleur pregnant by Jon, and passing the baby off as Michael's?  OH, please NO...did I just give the writers an idea?  I take it back, I take it back!",1077494400,27,3503,4.594202898550725

In fact, I didn't really find any character to care about in this series until the second season. That being said, there is something that fascinates about period pieces, and the Victorian Era seems to generate endless interest even when it means watching a mediocre drama to get a glimpse of that time.

1971565,4,B00015GA8A,"There's a lot to criticize about this series, but there's also a lot to like. I personally love historical dramas, so I admittedly tolerate 'less than' content if it still manages to take me away to another era, to a past-era story, which it did. Damian Lewis I always find to be strangely intriguing, his character in this was by far the most interesting. So completely devoid of any insight; cruel, cold, possessive, yet pitiful and sad and wanting only to be loved without any apparent insight as to why he was not so lovable. You can't help but to feel for him while you simultaneously despise him. He was truly brilliant as this character.

But alas, the series is certainly not without major flaws, primarily the ridiculous time span that takes place in the short amount of episodes. The aging of the characters over so many years - or lack of aging, disproportionate aging of characters, etc., is absurd. Some characters appear never to age while others are suddenly hobbling around gray with canes. And on that note, the general time jumps are extremely annoying. You get sucked into a story line and then suddenly the scene changes and it's ""eleven years later"".... ""nine years later""... etc. That I found very annoying, especially since child actors are replaced with entirely different adult actors and you have to piece together 'who is who'. There's also a tad too much ""irony"" to be realistic; it becomes sometimes predictable. There are some other things I could pick apart, but those are the biggest flaws in my opinion.

That said, it's still an intriguing story; intriguing enough that I was willing to tolerate the time jumps and aging issues. It's an interesting representation of the time, the era, the views on marriage, women's rights, social status, family dynamics, and more. So for me personally, it was still worth watching despite some blatant gaps in detail. But again, I love most historical dramas, especially British ones, so I was fine with setting aside realism for the sake of a good story. If you're big on accuracy and realism, this may not be for you. But if you just like to get carried away in a story and can set realism & detail aside as I did, then it's worthwhile.",1464220800,4,2208,4.732467532467532
1971566,3,B00015GA8A,"Too bad.  So much potential ruined by bad aging techniques, writing and yes, wooden performances by the main characters- so much so that we can't ever truly understand what they ever feel at all.  No human being can possibly be as wooden or cold as Soames or Irene.  Impossible.  I think the two actors overdid, I truly do.  I kept waiting for someone to make them come alive with passion to bring a contrast to their former coldness, to make sense of it, but it just never happened.  The story line made no sense at all- how could the characters Irene and Jolyon be so hypocritical as to forbid their son to not marry the one he love after they had ruined several marriages, not to mention their own children's lives, in order to follow their own passions?  I read another review that stated that Jolyon did not have any aversion to Fluer in the book but only worried for the safety and emotional well being of Irene- which would make more sense.  But the screen play had both Jon's parents playing terrible hypocrites standing against Jon's marriage wishes based merely on the quality of Fluer's family.  That makes both of them into detestable hypocrites of the worst sort.  That is just bad screen play writing that confuses the viewer.  I also didn't understand what we were supposed to feel about Profund.  What was he?  Sometimes we are supposed to like him and then, suddenly, he is a terrible cad.  Again, just confusing writing.  Ambiguous at best.  There were definitely moments of brilliance, moments where I was moved to tears- Soames confession to his daughter about raping Irene and her forgiveness of him was one of them.  I just wish the writing were more consistent with the characters' personalities.  The bad make-up was only a small distraction- but it was definitely there.  An entire decade would pass and the character looked as if no time had passed at all!  None of that would even matter if the writing and acting flaws weren't there to distract.  I guess I love a movie best when the characters are believable to the point where you can forget they are actors at all, their personalities are consistent, and they behave in ways that make sense for who they are.  When bad writing forces the actors to do strange things, say weird things and do things that clash with what they portrayed the character to be earlier, it just jolts your mind and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.  Lastly, the ending is too abrupt.  If there were more seasons to come, then perhaps that might make sense.  But this ending just leaves a person unsatisfied.  Too bad, too.  Great costumes, though.",1463184000,,2622,4.643478260869565
1971567,5,B00015GA8A,"I will start by saying that i loved this series. I am a huge fan of British period dramas. This is a particularly good one and it had me hooked from the first. I will admit though that i had to play pretend for some aspects of the series. Gina McKee, who plays the pivotal character of Irene, in the face of it, is not a good representation of what Irene should be. By appearances, it would be hard to imagine her having every man she encountered in a whirl about her beauty and mystery. Truthfully, she is quite gawky and rather awkward looking. It's really hard to imagine every man being captivated by her. I had to pretend that she was a real beauty in order to really enjoy the series. Her acting was good but i do believe she was miscast. I believed every other character. I didn't believe her in the role of Irene. I loved Fleur Forsyte and really believe that she would have been everything that Fleur was supposed to be. She was luminous and so full of life. Another of my favorite characters was Prosper Profond - although i am aware that his portrayal is not what was described in the book - but i adored his scenes. The actor who plays him has a infectious energy. It was difficult to look away. I would encourage anyone to watch the series. It is very well made. If you enjoy period dramas then this is definitely one to watch. The costumes and sets are fantastic. You feel like you are being taken back in time.",1463011200,,1425,4.281481481481482

I can however agree that the actress that played Irene really annoyed me. I feel that she had no soul. She treated Soames horribly and expected everyone around her to cater to her lifeless demeanor.

1971588,5,B00015GA8A,"I am a fan of period drama and a big Masterpiece fan.  I saw this series on PBS when it first aired around 2002 and am still crazy about it this time around. Damian Lewis is superb as the complex and often unlikable Soames Forsyte.  In reading some of the reviews written by others who feel that Gina McKee is miscast as Irene and even going so far as to describe her as cold, I disagree.  While she might appear to be reserved and somewhat aloof or unemotional on the outside, I feel that she portrays an elegant and graceful woman who is quite sensitive and masks the effects of the emotional traumas she has had to endure.  As I understand the social mores of the times, women without [family] money or position had few options except to marry or work in service.  Irene did not want to marry Soames in the first place.  Unhappiness, abuse and heartbreak follow.  Also social protocol of that era especially in the upper crust did not favor the public display of emotion.  While I did not see the original production of 1967 and have yet to read the books, I personally feel it is limited thinking to compare a reincarnation of a previously produced piece--drama, theater, music, etc.--with the first.  Why not treat it as an entity unto itself and accept it as it is on its own terms.  Maybe you loved the first experience but by holding tightly onto that, critiquing and comparing, you are missing the beauty and merit of the present.",1448150400,5,1439,4.5

1971693,5,B00015GA8A,"If ""Downton Abbey"" tells the story from the aristocracy's point of view, ""The Forsyte Saga"" is a gorgeous telling of the age from the perspective of the monied business class.  Along with a compelling tale of the lives and trials of three generations in a wealthy family, you get a depiction of the social and cultural constraints of the day.

The ending (no spoiler) is wrapped up but I would have liked a different ending.  It just sort of ended.  Hopefully the book does it more elegantly.  I'm sure there are plenty of reviews summarizing the story, so I won't.  I love the scenery, the costumes and the acting.  The story is rich in detail and modern even though it tells of a time long gone.  Country estates and city homes and carriages in Series 1 evolved to a more modern time in Series 2.  The excess (everything about Fleur!) is interesting to behold.  I love the customs of the time and if you're a Downton Abbey fan, you will adore the Forsyte Saga 1 & 2!",1440633600,2,762,4.265734265734266

1971717,4,B00015GA8A,"I am so delighted to find that I am in good company here with my distaste for the casting of McKee as Irene Forsyte. In fact, the general consensus here seems to be that her casting is the worst aspect of this otherwise high-quality production. Lucky for her (and the producers), the rest of the cast is so good and the story is so well portrayed that one is almost able to overlook a really second-rate Irene. I would've given the series 5 stars if it weren't for Ms. McKee. I in fact loathed her portrayal so very much that I can hardly bear to watch her scenes, which is difficult since she is in most of them. Instead of possessing an ethereal, passionate quality, Mckee's Irene is cold, unfeeling, frozen, insipid. Not the subtle temptress of the original story. June is so right when she says ""you are a leech. You have no life about you yourself, so you suck it out of everyone around you."" She hit the nail on the head. It's painful to watch a character that is played to be so passive, so lacking in charisma, so dull and spiritless. Gina McKee is too old for the role, and lacks the beauty, charisma and sexual magnetism to bring it off and make us believe that several men could fall madly in love with her against their better judgement, sacrifice their reputations and family relationships because they couldn't leave her alone. It just is not believable. Her affair with Bosinney is almost difficult to watch because the idea of him falling for her over the younger, more attractive and passionate June just doesn't make sense. Next to Grufudd McKee looks like his mother. Yes, I agree with the other viewers that she even looks too old for Soames--we are supposed to believe that this woman is young enough to be starting to think about having children? She looks to be in her early 40s when she marries Soames (McKee was 40 when this was made), and that's WITH a whole slew of makeup in an attempt to make her appear younger. When Soames begins to woo Irene in Bournemouth we're supposed to see her as a slip of a girl, and instead she appears matronly. By the time she gives birth to John, she looks ancient. They should have cast a woman about ten or fifteen years younger as Irene. A woman who is able to convey subdued passion and charisma--McKee, while a good actress, just doesn't have what it takes to play Irene. The ability to inspire our sympathy in her character is absolutely completely not there, and as a result we end up liking Soames, who is supposed to be the bad guy, and not her. It's a real shame, because Irene is a central character and crucial to the story. If it weren't for Irene's casting, I would give the production five stars. Corin Redgrave is wonderful as Jolyn Sr.--his warmth almost comes through the screen. Rupert Graves is great as his son. Lewis's portrayal is masterful, and the proof of that is that I came away having more sympathy for his character than Irene's, even though he is meant to be quite a brute. I enjoyed the casting of Fleur, Michael Mont, Profond, etc--and Ben Miles was WONDERFUL as Dartie. Absolutely wonderful. If only we had gotten a different Irene! I really for the life of me cannot understand what the casting director was thinking. Was he sleeping with Gina McKee? Did he owe her a favor or something? Did she blackmail him somehow in order to get the role? I kid but her casting here is a horrendous mistake in an otherwise very fine production.",1419638400,8,3427,4.493589743589744

1971721,3,B00015GA8A,If you like drama get this and it will supply for the years to come. The characters come in a vast array of personalities. Ones that I loved at the start but hated as the story unfolded. My favorite character hands down was Jolyn. He was not only easy on the eyes ladies but he was a genuine man. He gave up everything for love and never looked back. I loved that about him. My least favorite character were more than one. I liked Monty in the beginning but as he changed so did my opinion of him. His doormat...I mean wife made me feel so sad for her and her treatment. The ending for me was the worse I love a HEA and unfortunately am still waiting. Opinions vary but if the movie wouldn't have had Jolyn in it I would be rating this with one star.,1410652800,,750,4.074324324324325

The jazz era is here, automobiles are making their appearance, hair is bobbed, and women are enjoying some independence.

1971766,5,B00015GA8A,What a great series. I thoroughly enjoyed each season and really felt like I was living in that time period.  The actors were outstanding and their emotion was palpable. I hope more seasons are to follow.,1403740800,,204,4.666666666666667

I would like to see more shows like this, I do like the mini series venue.
I do wish you would add free new movies more often, and instead of showing one season on prime and charging for the second season. I would like to see it continue on prime.",1403654400,,292,4.051724137931035
1971768,4,B00015GA8A,"Very watchable.  Nice dowtown substitute but lacking in humor at most points.  It's that classic old school bbc period piece where they hadn't quite mastered weaving in humor with all the drama.  I remained engrossed throughout though and binged on it all.  I almost didn't watch season 2 since I thought it would be like Dallas now verses 80s Dallas, with kids running the roost but it was a decent continuation and seeing Soames at the end was well worth it.",1403308800,,460,4.6419753086419755
1971769,5,B00015GA8A,If you like Damian Lewis you must see this. He does so much with just facial expressions since his caracter is so repressed in his emotions. Great supporting cast also,1403049600,,167,4.6
1971770,5,B00015GA8A,"I found Series 2 to be even better than the first. What truly made this a stand out was the acting of Damian Lewis. I knew of him from his role in HOMELAND as ""Brody"" but he totally mesmerized me in this British saga.

I was so moved by the final scene where he meets first his daughter before her wedding and then Irenee for the last time. It left such an impression on me that I was mesmerized and brought to tears.

Such a strong message about love, possession, jealousy, and forgiveness..and often a message that is acted without words.

I loved this series but the last episode was absolutely amazing.

I felt so terribly sorry for ""Soames"" even though he had his flaws...but I couldn't have felt this way if he had not been protrayed so perfectly by Damian Lewis.

I give him a standing ovation!  Many other wonderful characters and actors...including ""Fleur"", ""Winifred"" and ""Jon""...""June"" and ""Irenee""...

I will watch it again one of these years!",1402531200,,955,4.615384615384615

The love story between his and Irenee's children was a shocking twist that you knew was doomed to failure & heartbreak for them.  The cordial parting of Soames & Irenee at the end reminds that sometimes, if they're fortunate, people can find their way to acceptance, change, and forgiveness.

I felt so sorry for Damian Lewis and then on some occasions I despised him. His first wife was so selfish and annoying. Albeit, she was a better a better fit with Rupert Graves.

How women married for money and position instead of love, for some it works and for others it did not. But some found love and lived a very happy live.

1971805,4,B00015GA8A,"Somehow, we had never heard about this series and found in on Prime one wintery evening.  Soon enough, we were hooked.

The story focuses on the emotionally repressed Forsyte family;  a wealthy (though not noble) British family living in London  in the late 1800's.  There are many talented actors on this project and performances are pretty good on the whole, despite some rather quirky moments later in the series by the normally extraordinary Damian Lewis.  We also felt Gina McKee was capable, though terribly miscast.

If you're a Downton Abbey fan, this will help quell the off-season jones.  But we found the ending really wanting and I later discovered the series only covered some of the books it was based upon.  That would explain the feeling I had for several days after that I must have missed a final episode.

All in all it was good fun and we looked forward to each episode.",1394582400,,890,4.720779220779221

The story is of the Family that expands for three generations  and focus on Irene and the mistake she made marrying for money then love. The catch, to me, is how the author stands back and doesn't truly assign a good or bad to each. I feel for them all. There are questions there that will stick in your mind, far beyond the written words. This is a enjoyable, thought provoking adventure period piece. If you enjoyed it as much as I did, you will seek out the books. Some things you will ask why?, but if you have ever been in love you will know why. If only Irene could have been cast by a actress as beautiful and beguiling as the author placed so much strength on, then I feel this would have been a classic as much as the books were many years ago!",1391817600,,1057,4.201970443349754

The ending is a-typical. It doesn't follow your standard love story. I did really like the final scene which typifies forgiveness. As I have posted on previous season, it is adult -centered drama with more explicit content than what BBC usually does.",1385078400,,423,4.716216216216216

The  changes from The Forsyte Saga trilogy were well considered and well dramatized, except for the very last scene of Soames and Irene shaking hands who in thereby letting ""by-gones be by-gones"" had the effect of making a mockery of the destruction of the love of Jon (Irene's son) and Fleur (Soames' daughter) that had result from that original Soames-Irene ruined marriage.  If they were to have shaken hands and let ""by-gones be by-gones"" that scene should have been when Soames unsuccessfully attempted much earlier to help Fleur win over Jon. That final scene should not have been changed; it had too great of a negating impact on the denouement of the Jon-Fleur love.",1378252800,2,924,4.8789808917197455

The interplay of the members of the Forsyte family, their struggles, secrets and feuds is very intriguing and makes you not want to wait to watch the next episode.  There are only two seasons, but they span an era from 1874 to the Roaring 20's and hold your interest the entire time.  I highly recommend it.",1367712000,,429,4.545454545454546

1971931,4,B00015GA8A,"""The Forsyte Saga"" was recommended to me by Amazon, based on other shows I put on my watchlist.  I can only assume that's because ""Downton Abbey"" is also on my watchlist, although I don't think ""Forsyte"" and ""Downton"" are all that comparable.  They both have a large cast of characters to keep track of, and take place over a fairly long period of time.  Both were filmed at beautiful locations.  Also, each show is fairly long - around an hour (without commercials).  However, ""Forsyte"" is almost entirely about the 'upstairs' people - it doesn't look at the dynamics between 'upstairs' and 'downstairs' as ""Dowton"" does, and that's part of what is so great about ""Downton"".  I found almost all of the characters compelling or engaging, and liked the overall storyline.  The show is worth your time.  I gave the show four stars rather than five because I felt the ending to season two (the last season, so far as I can tell) was...fairly abrupt, and not completely satsifying.  I will not say more here, as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.",1365811200,,1050,4.693989071038251

1971993,5,B00015GA8A,"The actors were great and the story was engaging, and I've rented this series twice because I loved it so much! So I almost bought Forsyte Saga about a year ago for Christmas when I read the negative reviews of both the 1st and 2nd seasons that praised the 1969 version instead. Rather than buying the new version, I decided to rent the 1969 adaptation.
Let me just say that (and this is my personal experience, can't help it), that I was able to sit through only the first few episodes, before I decided to wrap up the disks that I was renting and put them straight into the mail box to send them back to N.....x. I found it excruciatingly boring. I also want to add that I am a person who loves and appreciates all sorts of movies; mostly slow ones that deal with the psyche of people, that delve into human nature, period pieces, independent productions, movies from different parts of the globe, so me craving action, shooting, fast paced scenes, etc. was not the problem. The fact that the older version of FS was made in 1969 was also not the problem, because I love older movies as well, such as Upstairs Downstairs (which I actually own).

I do not want to offend anyone, we all have different tastes, all I'm saying; don't let the negative reviews put you off the new version of the series, give this one a chance too, it is fantastic! This year I am buying them for Christmas.

The one thing that I agree on is that, in the new version of FS, Irene does not look like the exquisite beauty that she is suppose to be according to the book. However, she is attractive enough for the part and doing an excellent job in portraying her character!",1322092800,,1650,4.371335504885994
1972014,2,B00015GA8A,"Ah - Series 2 - what can we say except ""BOO""? Series 1 had some promise, but there were already changes to the plot that we didn't like - even with wholesale borrowing of entire scene storyboards from the 1967 series - it was beautiful with great costumes and lavish sets but not quite up to snuff.

But with Series 2 - what a true disappointment! The director screwed up the timeline, changed character speeches from one to the other, messing with their motives, and just slopped together some hyper-sexual melodrama lacking the emotional complexity and sophistication of the book and the 1967 series. This is a very unsatisfactory ending - great costumes but truly a troubling tinkering.

Save your sofa time for the earlier 1967 masterpiece - sure - some of the actors' speaking in scenes may seem rushed (like they are trying to get a lot into little time) and the sets chintzy (could make a drinking game of walls wobbling when someone slams a door) but by no means did the director try to instill some mid-late 20th century archetype of rebellious/sullen/spoiled teenagers into a Victorian/Edwardian world where you were either a child or you weren't. And the other reviewers are right - too much sex (just in a time consuming, lame, bodice-ripper novel sort of way - don't watch this for boobies, you'll be disappointed).",1316563200,4,1328,4.794759825327511

1972018,5,B00015GA8A,"Young Jolyon is still my favorite character from Series 1 into this series. I like Soames better in this series than in series 1, but I've had high hopes for his character all along. Damian Lewis played Soames wonderfully - right down to the way he held his cane and walked. His performance in the final scene was tear-inducing. Just wonderful.

I was so sad when series 2 ended, but it was very satisfying and well done, and I cried happy tears...I was just sad it was all over. I just finished watching yesterday, but I already miss the whole Forsyte family, both sides.

I didn't much care for the later years in series 2 because the costumes were less elaborate although true to the time period. I'm not a fan of the clothing from the early 1900s, though. Flapper dresses and hair adornments, as beautiful as they are, are just not as fun and flattering in my opinion for the women as the costumes in series 1 during the late 1800s. At least the men always looked dashing through the whole of series 1 and 2.

One day, in a gallery run by their cousin June, Fleur and Soames run into a young man named Jon Forsyte, who seems to be some sort of relation, but one whom Soames does not care to know or even meet.  Fleur and Jon are attracted to each other and intrigued by the mystery of why their parents keep shying away from each other.  Jon's parents, Jolyon and Irene, hint that there was some sort of past conflict, but will say no more than that.

Naturally, the fact that their parents are bitterly opposed to their meeting again cause Fleur and Jon to contrive more encounters, eventually falling in love and making plans for their elopement.  In the process they also discover the true story of their parents' pasts, with devastating results.

This is a beautiful follow up to the first ""new"" series of The Forsyte Saga.  Once again the producers took a huge risk in attempting a remake of what is universally remembered as the epitome of British television, the original Forsyte Saga from the 1960s.  While the second series of this remake is much shorter than the original series, necessitating a truncated story line and the eliminiation of some subplots, it is very beautifully done, with fine acting and lovely settings in the English countryside.",1251504000,3,1398,4.771784232365145

1972041,4,B00015GA8A,"Having watched both Parts of the 2002 FORSYTE SAGA I must take umbrage with many of the reviewers here that have chastised the writers for either not being faithful to Galsworthy or the original series. The current creators are under no obligation to include or exclude anything. They are creating ""their"" story based on a previous work and are free to adapt as they see fit. We should judge the material on its own merits.

Galsworthy wrote a book. The reader creates in his mind the movie and no two readers are likely to ever come up with the same images. Most readers will take issue with most adaptations of books. Its never going to be as they imagined it because it will be as the adaptor imagined it.

I found it interesting that so many of the reviewers pointed out that the first meeting between Jon and Fluer as children NEVER took place as though we were taking about historical events. It isn't history, its fiction. It may not have taken place in Glasworthy's novel because the idea never occurred him. I feel that scene made perfect sense in the scheme of things.

The other two scenes that many of the writers here had issue with were the sex scene which I somewhat agree didn't feel right under the circumstances of Young Jolyn's passing. Still we all handle the stress of a parent dying in our own way and I would defy any man to withstand the charms of woman like Fluer when it was being put forth in such an appealing manner.

I will take issue with the dragging out of the wedding. I longed for a more positive resolution between the lovers who seemed so suited to each other. I kept expecting young Jon to burst into the wedding and smash on window to stop it like some Jazz age Benjamin. Other wise why show so much detail of an inevitable wedding between Fluer ad Michael Mont. A man she clearly did not love. To me that was a tease and a filler.

The final scene between Soames and Irene really did not feel right either as many have said. It seemed a forced conclusion to try and give some kind of an upbeat ending to the Saga. We long for them to reach some kind of forgiveness and understanding but it just didn't seem right to me in the manner that it was portrayed.

I also questioned Irene giving Robin Hill up in the first place. This house had been built by the love of her life and had been the home that she so happily shared with Young Joylen. It seems to me that Irene giving up Robin Hill would be like Scarlet giving up Tara. But THAT I am sure she did do in the novel thus the title ""To Let."" What I am saying here is Galsworthy was wrong and the screenwriters were true to his material.

All in all I was very moved by the series. I though the look of the sets and costumes was magnificent. Gina McKee stole my heart in the film NOTTING HILL and was the chief reason for my interest in the FS. She was absolutely fabulous beginning to end.

Part one would be five stars because of Mckee. Part two four stars because she wasn't in it as much.",1114646400,9,2982,4.284191829484902
1972042,5,B00015GA8A,I just thoroughly enjoyed this series. I enjoy watching it more on DVD than on television because I could watch the series all at one time and not over week after week. Acting and story fabulous. A must see.,1111363200,6,207,4.333333333333333
1972043,5,B00015GA8A,"I loved this movie even more than the first part.  The first part deserves a five-star rating as well for great acting and story.  Unlike many of the reviews I loved series two more than series one.  By the time you have watched six episodes of Forsytes you will know them pretty well and as you watch Fluer and Jon try to unravel the mysteries of Forsyte History you can feel the emotions of every character and see where they are coming from.  As a plus I am infatuated with the Jazz era.  The clothes and the lifestyle are the backdrop for this eye-candy of a film.  The diffenerces between generations is always an interesting subject and it is a re-accuring theme here.  You see how London has changed, how Soames gasps at the revealing dresses his daughter wears, how Irene struggles to get her head around the new music and dancing.  I have not read the book or seen the 60's versions of either series so I can give an unbiased opinion.  I also can understand how sometimes in adaptations, certain things that work in print do not work on the screen, so it doesn't bother me when the screenwriters take liberties.  On it's own aside from previous versions, this is a fantastic movie with a deeply rooted story, multi-faceted characters, beautiful costumes and production, and fabulous acting.  Remember that most of the actors in this series have already played their respective characters for the epic first series and have mastered them.  That is the beauty of this series.  Some will complain that the characters are not significantly aged enough, but lets face it, many of these actors are supposed to span 40 years of their characters life between the two series, and make-up aging usually just looks frightening.  At least this way you have the same skillful cast.",1105315200,17,1777,4.690322580645161
1972044,4,B00015GA8A,"For most of the four episodes of ""The Forsyte Saga, Series 2"" (a.k.a. ""The Forstye Sage: To Let"") I had a sense of disappointment that it was just not as good as the first part, produced a year earlier.  I was able to trace my feelings to a couple of key points.  First, I had never read the John Galsworthy novels and had not seen either the 1949 Hollywood film ""That Forsyte Woman"" with Errol Flynn and Greer Garson or the the 1967 BBC production with Eric Porter, Nyree Dawn Porter, and Kenneth More.  So when I watched Series 1 it was all news to me.  Then, unwilling to wait for Series 2 to make it across the Pond, I went ahead and watched the 1967 version.  That meant that with Series 2 the story was not new to me and I was aware of some plot lines that were missing.

Second, Series 1 ended with the most powerful scene in the entire story.  The tragic Soames Forsyte (Damien Lewis), having seen his first wife Irene (Gina McKee) leave him for his cousin Jolyon (Rupert Graves) and bear for him the son she refused to give him, has remarried and his wife is finally having his child.  But the birth was difficult and Soames had to decide if the doctor should operate, which would kill the baby but save his wife, or risk both their lives on the slim chance they would both live.  Soames takes the risk and is rewarded by the birth of a daughter and not the male heir he desired.  Then word came that his father was dying and Soames rushed to the old man's side to announce the birth of his son.  His father died happy hearing the lie and Soames returned to his home to be told that his wife would never be able to have another child.  But when Soames looks at his daughter for the first time, his heart warms to her.  It was a marvelous moment and a great performance by Lewis and I watched Series 2 knowing that it was not going to be equalled let alone surpassed.

On the one hand I was certainly right.  The final great irony of the Forsyte Saga is that Soame's daughter Fleur (Emma Griifiths Malin) and young Jon Forsyte (Lee Williams), daughter of Irene and Jolyon, manage to meet and fall in love to the absolute horror of their parents.  The young couple, of course, do not know about the ugly circumstances under which Irene left Soames long before they were born, and nobody is eager to tell them the story.  Eventually it will come out and result in the less than happy circumstances that we have come to expect in this particular soap opera.  This is not a saga in which everybody lives happily ever after.

The good news and the bad news is that I liked the final scene of this production.  This is good because it salvaged Series 2 for me at a point when I was close to regretting the sense of anticipation I had enjoyed waiting for it to come out on DVD.  The bad part is that it is a scene that created for this version and not part of either the original novel or BBC series.  The climax of a work is not exactly the part to go off text as far as I am concerned and I am glad I was not as familiar with Galsworthy's work as are others who have taken this production to task for various changes and additions they see as violating his original vision.  That is why I was able to enjoy Series 2 well enough, while still thinking it falls short of the greatness of Series 1.

Whoever wrote this adaptation seemed to have been as captivated by Soames' character as I was, and determined to give him another big moment that decidedly changes the meaning and import of the entire saga.  The return of Annette (Beatriz Batarda) into Soames' life helps to set up the final scene, so it is not like it is it was just tacked on to the story.  But I missed the way Soames struggled with the demands of modern art, which is now replaced by the symbolic irony of juxtaposing Irene playing modern music on her piano while Soames purchases a player piano.  Galsworthy made his point with considerably more depth, which is what I wanted this time around as well.  Series 2 really is reduced to the story of Fleur and Jon as something of Soames and Irene the next generation, and obvious ""The Forstye Saga"" is on a grander scale than that.",1094774400,4,4148,4.2765685019206146
1972045,5,B00015GA8A,"This two disc six hour story is a continuation of series one and brings in the children of the two main characters, Soames and Ireene ..... The main characters of the first series do not disappear, and this series two is not a rehash of what happend to the parents but a continuation of the saga.
Why the publishers decided to split this into two series is totally beyond me since I can't imgine buying the second series and asking a million complicated and intricate question of who what when and where ... So don't do it buy both Series one and two and follow the story ...
Enclosed is a review I wrote for the Series one of this fabulous DVD set
Series One: DVD series with 2 espisodes per disc, a full 'nine' hour story was so exciting that my wife and I we had a veritable group show up at the house demanding that we can't finish the series without them being there to witness and enjoy every moment .....
And that's what happened, we not only went through the nine hours of Series one but also the more than 6 hours of Series two making it a FABULOUS weekend of 15 hours of exiting, thoughtfull, thrilling and tender stories of love, hate, revenege and posession .....
Trust me you are talking to a guy that falls asleep in most of today's movie theaters after the first half hour so for me to hang in there for a full 15 hourse makes this and absolute MUST recommendation to purchase for your DVD collection....
Oddy enough, I do however think that women from ages 19 and up will gobble up the love stories of the Forsythe saga while the men however MUST be at least 35 years old or older. I guess it has something to do with a lack of violence and explicit gratuitous sex, so, I suggest that you get a DVD of 'Kill Bill Vol1' and have them watch that in another room over and over ....
OK I'm not going to go into the story or more details in this review since much has already been written about this famous series ... suffice it to say that I certainly identified with the plight of one of the main characters, Soames, the wealthy Forsyth that marries Ireene, a beutifull young woman that does not love him.
Thats the devilishness of the story, he suffers for the love of a woman he can't posess while she suffers for the love of men that get taken away from her......
WOW this is the best EVER in DVD and it will deliciously blow away a weekend with you, your friends and significant others ....",1084838400,15,2407,4.280701754385965

8006679,5,B00015GA8A,"I really enjoyed this series. I didn't read the books 1st, which I typically do, & then am drawn to watch the theatrical version. SO well written, & so honest. The themes though conservative because of the time period and aristocratic societal expectations, example the complexities of family bonds, expectations, loyalties, divisions, etc. I cried many times watching this. The relationship between Irene and Soames is heartbreaking. I DO feel sorry for him, because she is so cold towards him, but she can't pretend to like him when she despises. It's almost like her depth of revulsion is deeper because she hates him for the wrong choice that SHE made. She used him, & then despises him for making her use him, without blaming herself or ever apologizing. Their relationship would be more tolerable if he wasn't so austere and awkward. Jolyon is one of my favorite characters because like his father in the end, he truly has a heart of gold, & doesnt care what people think of him. A true artist at heart.
I loved all the complexities of this story. It feels timeless!
