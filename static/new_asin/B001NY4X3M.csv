3724858,5,B001NY4X3M,"The characters in Caroline in the City: The Second Season got better as they got used to each other.  The relationships between the characters really blossomed in this season.  The only thing I wish hadn't changed were the credits; the opening credits show other comic strips rather than just the Caroline in the City strip.  There are so many episodes since they are a half-hour long, this television show was a good choice and a good value!",1243987200,6,442,4.714285714285714
3724859,5,B001NY4X3M,One of my favorite shows.  I am so glad they are bringing this to DVD.,1239321600,3,70,3.6666666666666665
3724860,4,B001NY4X3M,"I have to say I love Caroline in the City! I got the first season right after a huge break up with my boyfriend of 6 years. I put in first season one night and laughed despite my sadness from my break up. I had to get season two as soon as it came out and it delivered the laughs even better then Season 1. Caroline always trying to do the right thing and it usually blows up in her face and Richards wonderful dry humor is great. I was very young when this show aired and I still remember the episode where Caroline's neighbor Annie, sister finds the love letter Richard wrote for Caroline and turns it into a song. I loved re watching that one again so if your looking for a show with a lot of laughs and some romance! You really can't go wrong",1238716800,8,746,4.047297297297297

3724862,5,B001NY4X3M,This show is funny and very entertaining.  Why it only lasted four years is beyond me.  They must have had it in a bad time slot.  Now I need Seasons 3 and 4!  Where are they???,1416009600,,177,3.8333333333333335

3724866,4,B001NY4X3M,This Comedy seems to have faded from our tv memory. But it is clever well cast and has a fair amount of charm. The fact that the ladies had the best legs on the air didn't hurt either.,1378944000,,184,3.8684210526315788
3724867,5,B001NY4X3M,I really love this series and was glad to get season 2.  Hopefully season 3 and 4 will be forthcoming.,1366848000,,102,4.1

received very fast from seller . would order from them again.",1356220800,,180,3.763157894736842
3724871,5,B001NY4X3M,"This has to be one of my favorite TV shows of all time and I was so happy to find that it and the first season were on DVD. It really has a great cast, and the writing was great. What a great cast.",1356048000,,197,3.5
3724872,5,B001NY4X3M,"This is a very good comedy that I'd recommend. The writers give these characters some great lines and it is a real treat to watch them interact. If you have not watched it, you should give it a try.",1355184000,,198,4.102564102564102
3724873,5,B001NY4X3M,This DVD of Caroline in the city (The Second Season) was fantastic.  A good follow up to the 1st Season of Caroline in the city.,1355097600,,128,4.12
3724874,5,B001NY4X3M,"I just watch season two of Caroline in the City. It's funnier than ever. I recommend to anyone to order/buy this dvd but buy the first season first to see and understand it. It begs the question how long will season three and four be coming out on dvd? I think that its the dvd sales that have made the show stop selling on dvd. So I think that its up to us the fans of the show to write, send email to the production companies to demained or request to have the rest of the season of Caroline on dvd. How come the UK has the complete set (not having the episodes in order) out on dvd without our region not sellin it?",1350777600,2,618,3.9919354838709675

3724876,3,B001NY4X3M,"Has Paramount given up on this show?  It seems that they decided to stop halfway through the series.  If they're not going to release the final two seasons, then why did they even bother to release the first two?",1328745600,,212,4.410256410256411
3724877,5,B001NY4X3M,"I am not the biggest television watcher--I have never seen a single episode of many programs that are very popular--yet I always tried to catch this show when it was on. I missed some, naturally, so I was pleased to see these released on DVD. I find some of them just as funny a second and third time, but it's a huge disappointment not to be able to follow the story through to the end...",1325548800,2,389,4.2
3724878,3,B001NY4X3M,"I bought this for my wife because she liked this show when it was on NBC. But even she got bored after watching the episodes a few times. Maybe good for rainy-day viewing, but if you're looking for ""must-see TV"", it ain't here.",1276300800,,227,4.3023255813953485

3724880,5,B001NY4X3M,"This is the second season and it is just as great as the first.  Can't wait to watch the remaining seasons.  It is such a good show, they don't make comedies like this for tv anymore.  I can relate with these characters and they make me laugh.  I couldn't wait to sit down and watch them every night.  You won't be disappointed.",1245801600,9,328,4.225806451612903

8328356,5,B001NY4X3M,"Loved 'Caroline'.  I have Seasons one and two.  Hey, guys, where are the rest of the seasons?!?!?  I guess they stopped at Season 2 and now we will have to wait for Shout Factory to do a whole set of all seasons and for us Caroline fans to shell out more money for the entire series, including re-buying Seasons one and two.  But Seasons one and two that are available are great.",1513555200,,379,4.222222222222222
