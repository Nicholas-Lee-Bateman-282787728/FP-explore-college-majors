5371144,4,B009XICTBS,"A story, as told through the POV of two drunk friends, who have no idea their stories are connected. Quite an interesting narrative device, and a pretty charming movie as well.",1381104000,6,176,4.709677419354839
5371145,2,B009XICTBS,"They have no real plots, I just chalked this up to wasted money and didn't even finish watching it. Just plain not worth taking time to watch... I doubt I would have watched to the end even if it were free.",1361750400,,206,4.048780487804878

5371147,5,B009XICTBS,I didn't feel much depth or delicate layers of irony as in other Hong Sangsoo's movies but it is still good. So witty. Pleasantly funny.,1447632000,,136,4.48
5371148,3,B009XICTBS,I liked it. I am not sure what kind of lessons this movie appeals to audiences.,1436400000,,79,4.0
5371149,5,B009XICTBS,Enjoyed this movie because it had an interesting story line.,1430611200,,60,5.1
5371150,2,B009XICTBS,"I didn't find this entertaining at all, despite other reviews about it. It was just two friends talking about a vacation they had and drinking. The men were generally portrayed as creeps, and the women as lovesick doormats. I can't imagine that such is the norm, at least I hope not. There didn't seem to be much of a story line. The acting was ok, but the dialogue was dopey and the direction was without direction. The only constant was the ""mom"" character, but this was not played up.",1419465600,,487,4.48314606741573

5371152,1,B009XICTBS,It is non sense story. anybody can go with anybody with out with out a reason. This is foolish story.,1402272000,,101,4.1
5371153,4,B009XICTBS,director is a french favourite for a reason.  the characters are annoying in a really smart way.  its an odd korean take on a french genre.,1402099200,3,139,4.3076923076923075
5371154,4,B009XICTBS,"It is like a watching very ordinary story superbly expressed. I watched the film because I went to the same school (UC Berkeley) as the director and was following his works. As usual, he brings the depth of characters' emotion with intrinsic cultural subtly described so accurately.
I wonder how non-Korean (or even Asian) would perceive this movie. Certainly not for GI Joe or large Hollywood followers. If you want artistic expression of people without ego and dramatization, this is a great movie to watch. Very delightful and subtle movie... more of European style than U.S.",1400976000,2,578,5.03125
5371155,5,B009XICTBS,"I only saw the good things in this movie ;) You know, and not the sad and dark ones.

I love so many things about this: the performances, the writing, the irony, the setting. I used to think HSS was great because he didn't show romanticized versions of Korean cities, but here I see I've been wrong: he makes no-where towns like Tongyeong utterly passionate and romantic. It was great to see Moon Sori, whom it's hard for me to think of as other than that girl in ""Oasis"".
The poor poet was a new character in HSS films, but very appropriate -- his obvious pretensions, his obsession with theory and perception (which always leads to hypocrisy in HSS's movies), and his woman-chasing. What felt new about him was that he had nothing to offer women, and acknowledged it himself. His friend even wondered aloud, ""Are you really that good looking?"" This poet was an ironic foil to the women that normally populate HSS's movies: they are usually desired for their beauty and the adventure they offer -- and little else (and to reinforce patriarchy, of course). However, by using a male character, HSS subverts his normal sexual politics with something really interesting.

Ah, how wonderful it's been to follow an artist develop for so long.

Best parts: everything with Admiral Yi Sun-shin (including the man asking ""Doesn't history often create fabrications that leads people to mythologize figures?"". LOL!!) and the spanking scene, which puts anything in the movie ""Mother"" by that hack director whose name I chose to not say,  to shame.",1391126400,7,1536,4.828897338403042
8545057,4,B009XICTBS,I like this film but I like movies where the actors looks like real people in real situation and not glam out Hollywood stereotypes.  Might not appeal to everyone but I really enjoyed it.,1486684800,,187,4.5
8545058,2,B009XICTBS,Sorry...I've watched hundreds of Korean dramas and this does not even come close to a good one.  Characters are irritating.  Movie itself irritating.  Subs were terrible (maybe that was part of the problem).,1485820800,,207,5.212121212121212
8545059,1,B009XICTBS,Not funny at all. Extremely boring. I can't stand this movie.,1478390400,2,61,4.636363636363637
8545060,3,B009XICTBS,"this is a lifetime style movie for chicks who like exploring male/female relationships in other cultures or men satisfying the sensitive part of their nature...that being said, it's a good movie",1474243200,,194,5.290322580645161

8545065,3,B009XICTBS,"You can tell that a lot of thought and effort went into making this film. It's like making an omelet instead of a souffle.

This is an ordinary story with an ordinary-looking cast.

Pros: Witty story (the director is making the most of what he has), in-depth characters, great dialogue, excellent cinematography.

Cons: Story is not very original; my friend, a Korean native, said the subtitle translations were totally messed up!; he ended telling me what was actually said/going on since he knows both Korean and English very well; quite stereotypical as men are portrayed as total perverts and women who are easily exploited and vulnerable. I am pretty sure this is not widespread in Korea. (But what do I know? I've only been to Seoul once recently!)

This ""film"" seemed to go easier after I consumed two bottles of wine! Maybe the film festival judges did the same!

Enjoy and watch this film with your favorite adult beverage (I recommend sake, soju (a LOT), or single malt scotch...",1452902400,2,989,4.828402366863905
8545066,1,B009XICTBS,"I like Hong Sang-soo's work, so my low rating here should not be misconstrued as a criticism of his films. The quality of the dvd's from this company called ""Asian Crush"" are TERRIBLE! First problem: they're in the WRONG aspect ratio. They should be in widescreen, but they're in the (almost) square/full-frame ratio. Second problem: the subtitles are BURNED IN. This means that if you speak Korean and don't need the subs, you're stuck with them. Or if you want to employ the ""zoom"" option on your 16 X 9 tv to try and force the movie into the correct aspect ratio, you can't also move the subtitles up the way you can when they're optional. Third problem: there's something seriously wrong with the way they've been mastered. There's a frequent ""hitching"" effect in the motion which is incredibly annoying. Get real dvd's if you want to see Hong's films. These dvd-r's from Asian Crush are worthless.",1450137600,,902,4.751592356687898
