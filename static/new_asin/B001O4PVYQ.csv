5708055,5,B001O4PVYQ,"This, like ALL Nova programs was informative and entertaining!  I would recommend the entire Nova series to everyone young and old!",1391040000,,131,5.238095238095238
5708056,2,B001O4PVYQ,"It lists the original air date as 2008, but it is all clearly of mid-70's vintage.  You can't watch 5 minutes of any episode without thinking this is something you would have watched on a reel to reel film strip in grade school.  No real interviews where the subjects seem to be speaking freely, everyone is stiff and reading a script.  When We Left the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, and Moon Machines are much, much better.",1390089600,13,429,4.405063291139241
5708057,5,B001O4PVYQ,"Kind things me of 16mm films in grade school, but I loved this.  Presented by the actual astronauts with footage you don't often see.  Makes me feel like I was 10 again.",1389484800,,169,4.25
5708058,4,B001O4PVYQ,This is a good review of the space program that we once had.  It put into perspective what we've achieved.  It would be nice to have it redone in HD but you can't have everything.  Nice to know we did cooperate with the Russians when they were able to put the financial effort into their program prior to their financial collapse years later.,1389312000,,342,4.396825396825397
5708059,3,B001O4PVYQ,"It's looks quite old and a bit rough, but contains some good information if you like space and NASA stuff.",1388620800,,106,4.35
5708060,1,B001O4PVYQ,After 10 minutes I thought I was back in 3rd grade. Was hoping to hear details but instead just heard simple fluff.,1388361600,4,115,4.2727272727272725
5708061,5,B001O4PVYQ,"Very good pictures from NASA.  It moved along very fast.  It is a great summary for non space nuts and almost not enough for NASA nuts like myself.  Other reviewers thought is should be longer and I agree.  The one hour per episode goes by so fast.  That being said this collection of  NASA's movies are unreal.  My mouth was open wide 90% of the time.  It is a must have for anyone that is interested in NASA or want to learn some history from this era in American History.  I loved every single frame.  It reminds you of a time when America was doing some unbelievable things as the world watch in awe.  Sincerely,  Big Wave Dave, Paddling Out",1384214400,3,645,4.283333333333333
5708062,4,B001O4PVYQ,"outstanding  item,  great  condition, and  gives an excellant  account, of the  nasa  space history.  Auuthor  gives  an  excellent  account  of the  success, and tragities,  that  afected  the history.",1372291200,,202,5.642857142857143
5708063,5,B001O4PVYQ,Very interesting to see some of the history and back-stories of the early space program - perfect for space-geeks!!,1474416000,,115,5.105263157894737

5708065,5,B001O4PVYQ,Good history lesson,1472860800,,19,5.666666666666667
5708066,3,B001O4PVYQ,"If it was more in the way of actual video of moon walks or video inside Skylab flights and not just film, then it would had been more interesting. Great for the naysayers who say we did not go to the Moon.",1470700800,,205,3.9047619047619047
5708067,4,B001O4PVYQ,Very informative and allows you to get an inside look of the events that occurred in the space program.,1470700800,,103,4.473684210526316
5708068,2,B001O4PVYQ,not so good,1469491200,,11,3.0

5708070,5,B001O4PVYQ,i found it very informative.  i am getting ready to watch episode three,1468627200,,71,4.461538461538462
5708071,4,B001O4PVYQ,"Some repetitious content, but overall a very good documentary.",1468540800,,62,6.0
5708072,4,B001O4PVYQ,This was my grandson's rating.  I haven't watched it.  He said it was really nice including all past missions and incredible detail.  He liked the music too. He learned a lot of things he hadn't known previously and that is hard to do.  He studies this type of thing a lot.,1467072000,,273,4.294117647058823
5708073,3,B001O4PVYQ,I didn't realize the narration would be so dated. Still informative.,1465948800,,68,5.2727272727272725
5708074,2,B001O4PVYQ,Very out of date.,1465257600,,17,3.5
5708075,3,B001O4PVYQ,It's differently a government video. There are some clips that I have never seen before with more on each of the missions in more detail then what has been previously released.,1464739200,,176,4.709677419354839
5708076,5,B001O4PVYQ,Great movie,1463788800,,11,5.0
5708077,5,B001O4PVYQ,Great history of nasa. Awesome interviews with some of the astronauts who participated in the programs that made our space agency what it is today and shows us the importance of space travel and study.,1462406400,,201,4.771428571428571
5708078,5,B001O4PVYQ,Excellent program,1461110400,,17,8.0
5708079,4,B001O4PVYQ,Maybe a little too much for novice watchers but great for fans who have seen most of the typical footage from NASA.,1461024000,,115,4.2727272727272725
5708080,5,B001O4PVYQ,Great retrospective and some neat footage.  Some of the audio quality on the older films is pretty poor though.,1459209600,,111,4.842105263157895
5708081,4,B001O4PVYQ,This documentary is the most complete to date.  It took a while to watch the entire collection.  It was worth it.,1457308800,,113,4.333333333333333
5708082,5,B001O4PVYQ,Cool.,1456617600,,5,5.0
5708083,1,B001O4PVYQ,Old footage and low resolution quality. I was disappointed.,1456531200,,59,5.666666666666667
5708084,3,B001O4PVYQ,"Nice overview what I live through as a teenager, didn't know at the time how big a mark on history it was going to be. Program has a nice insight to the people behind the seen.",1454198400,,176,3.9166666666666665
5708085,5,B001O4PVYQ,Must-see.,1453507200,,9,9.0
5708086,5,B001O4PVYQ,"Good stuff, lot more old footage",1453075200,,32,4.5
5708087,4,B001O4PVYQ,"I haven't completed the entire series yet, but I've seen most of it.  I have really enjoyed the show, and I feel like it helped me get a better understanding of what those early NASA programs were about, and what they were doing during those missions.  I like the original footage, but some of it is kind of low quality.  I guess that's to be expected, considering when it was shot, and the equipment available at the time.
All in all, a good series and worth the time to check out.",1449014400,,482,4.274725274725275
5708088,4,B001O4PVYQ,Husband watched this.,1448323200,,21,6.333333333333333

5708090,2,B001O4PVYQ,Kind of boring.,1444176000,,15,4.333333333333333
5708091,2,B001O4PVYQ,Just recycles old black and white Nasa compliations of missions.,1441843200,,64,5.5
5708092,4,B001O4PVYQ,"The only reason it got four stars. ""It's not in HD""",1441497600,,51,3.727272727272727
5708093,3,B001O4PVYQ,I was trying to get a review but it very in depth!,1439510400,,50,3.25
5708094,3,B001O4PVYQ,"It's ok for what it is, but some of it feels like old propaganda films - part 1 repeatedly states that Alan Shepard  was the first man in the world to space when it was Yuri Gagarin in April of 1961,  Shepard followed a month later in May.

This is not HD footage, but a nostalgic look for those of us who are over 30 and remember the old documentaries in school..",1434326400,4,364,4.027777777777778
5708095,5,B001O4PVYQ,most interesting,1433721600,,16,7.5
5708096,4,B001O4PVYQ,"it was good , and interesting!",1433203200,,30,4.166666666666667
5708097,5,B001O4PVYQ,If you like space exploration this is the coolest. If you like napping with golf on TV this is even better.,1431388800,,107,4.142857142857143
5708098,2,B001O4PVYQ,"This isn't what I thought it was going to be. It is 40 years old, pretty boring for a layperson, and really shows its age. I thought it was going to be the specials that aired in 2009, the 40th anniversary of the moon landing. Those were great! If I find those anywhere, I'll be sure to give them a better rating.",1430352000,,313,4.064516129032258
5708099,5,B001O4PVYQ,I watched Neil Armastong step onto the moon when I was 6 years old and am so glad to have lived long enough to be able to take in the myriad stories of one of my country's overarching achievements. This series is fascinating.,1429833600,,225,4.255813953488372
5708100,4,B001O4PVYQ,Nostalgic,1425945600,,9,9.0
5708101,3,B001O4PVYQ,Ok. Little disjointed. Goes from Mercury to Skylab in one jump. Clearly sanitized for general consumption. But on the whole OK,1424390400,,126,5.0476190476190474
5708102,5,B001O4PVYQ,Great,1418169600,,5,5.0
5708103,5,B001O4PVYQ,"first one was awesome....hard to maintain interest with later episodes.  Production is older footage and not a modern production, but all the original moon footage is great to watch it all in one place and in order.",1417564800,,215,4.8108108108108105
5708104,4,B001O4PVYQ,Great footage and insights not revealed before.,1412380800,,47,5.857142857142857
5708105,1,B001O4PVYQ,very dated and hard to watch.,1409788800,,29,4.0
5708106,5,B001O4PVYQ,"I enjoyed the synopsis, I am old enough to remember Spudnik, Gagarian, and Allen Shepard.  Nice nostalgia.",1408838400,,106,5.235294117647059
5708107,3,B001O4PVYQ,Good content but pretty boring. Lots of video I don't remember ever seeing before.,1407110400,,82,4.928571428571429
5708108,1,B001O4PVYQ,This video was produced circa 1994 and the quality (or lack there-of) shows.  Skip this.,1404691200,,88,4.866666666666666
5708109,4,B001O4PVYQ,Many of the scenes I remember seeing 50 years ago when every flight was an adventure. Good detailed history of the early years of NASA.,1403049600,,135,4.44
5708110,5,B001O4PVYQ,"Excellent!  We homeschool, and our boys truly enjoyed this series - very educational!  We'll almost certainly be watching it again and again!",1401926400,,141,5.363636363636363
5708111,1,B001O4PVYQ,"This was awful. Static pictures with badly monotone dictation overplayed. I honestly felt like I was being forced to watch a Death by PowerPoint presentation at a staff meeting. I would give a lower star rating if possible. I was excited to watch this, I love watching NASA documentaries. This makes NASA look terrible and should be taken down.",1400889600,,344,4.8474576271186445
5708112,5,B001O4PVYQ,Fantastic. Especially enjoy videos and stories that never reached the airwaves the first time around. Makes us fall in love with space science all over again.,1395878400,,158,5.115384615384615
8578884,1,B001O4PVYQ,"Alan Shepard is the first man in space? After this phrase I stopped watching and wrote this review, I don't know if the rest of the series is good but as it began so badly I had to give it 1 star.

It was gagarin or considering the reviewed version Ilyushin...",1517875200,,260,4.098039215686274
8578885,1,B001O4PVYQ,"I quit watching this garbage after a minute and fifteen seconds, right after ""Alan Shepard is best remembered as the first man in space""",1487203200,,136,4.708333333333333
8578886,4,B001O4PVYQ,"Quite comprehensive overall, although some of the facts are a little glossed over in early NASA style.  You can sure tell the earlier-made episodes were Cold War era.  A worthy watch for anyone interested in the history of space travel.",1484697600,,236,4.875
8578887,3,B001O4PVYQ,"A little slow at times and somewhat repetitive, but overall very eductional.",1484438400,,76,5.416666666666667
8578888,1,B001O4PVYQ,Boring.,1483574400,,7,7.0
8578889,4,B001O4PVYQ,It was a very good documentary on NASA,1482969600,,38,3.875
8578890,1,B001O4PVYQ,"S0E1 1:00 - ""Alan Shepard is best remembered as the first man in space"". Seriously? In point of fact, Shepard was the THIRD man into space, the first being Vladimir Ilyushin whose space journey was kept secret by the USSR because he was in too poor condition after his space flight to be presented to the public, and Yuri Gagarin, the second cosmonaut to travel to space. What's the point of a documentary that makes you stupider?",1480118400,,430,4.597402597402597
8578891,5,B001O4PVYQ,Excellent official NASA footage from back in the day.,1479600000,,53,5.0
8578892,3,B001O4PVYQ,"I've seen many many many ""so called"" live footage from the moon landing and other space activities.  I think people will believe whatever they want to for the most part.  But to me, if you can disprove or prove there was any ""hanky panky"" going on with the footage and appearances, just like a court of law, someone or some people manipulated it, therefore it calls into question ALL of the mission/s.  Including Mars.  There are many better nasa reviews and critiques including some of a reel that was never to be shown for public viewing.  You can see air bubbles, shadows the wrong way for 1 light source, just so many wrong things or odd things it's impossible for it to have happened (the moon landings) the way they claim.  Why would they have had to do that if in fact we did go to the moon.  And why wouldn't Neal Armstrong simply put his hand on the Bible and swear he did land on the moon?  Because he is a Christian and already is worried about his fate, and doesn't want to make things worse.  I believe before Mr. Armstrong dies, if there is time, he will be honest and confess the landings never took place.  I do NOT believe we ever landed on the moon, or flew around it or whatever.  Just doesnt make sense.  There would be no reason to ""lie"", or falsely maniplulate the scenes from the window of the capsule making the earth look like a crescent.  There are so many flat out lies.  Please,  prove me wrong!!!!  No one has yet.",1475712000,,1443,4.3283582089552235
