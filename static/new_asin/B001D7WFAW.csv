8292238,5,B001D7WFAW,"For Rufus Sewell fans, this over-looked mini-series from 1992 (when Rufus was 25!) is a wonderful treat.  The late (great) Peter Cook plays Rufus' father in this story of the ""Corporation"" attempting to gobble up the Small Family-Owned Business (a garden centre/nursery, hence Gone to Seed.)  This series has it all: Love, plot twists, surprising revelations, personal growth of some characters, Country and Western music (inside joke) and great performances by the excellent cast. Oscar-winner Jim Broadbent is always spot-on.  The Royal Television Society nominated it for ""Best Single Drama"" in 1993.",1331856000,7,603,5.532608695652174
8292239,4,B001D7WFAW,"This is a 2-DVD set with all 6 episodes of this British series.
When the elderly mother of triplets (two sons and a daughter, played by Jim Broadbent, Alison Steadman and Warren Clarke) dies, two of the three want to finally make the family garden center a beautiful and modern spot for garden lovers. But the third is seduced by the money offered by a ruthless businessman (Peter Cook) who wants to buy the land and turn it into a landing spot for helicopters. To help speed things up, the businessman's stepson Billy (Rufus Sewell) seduces the daughter, Hilda, and in the end, the triplets lose the deed to their land. But then their mother's ghost starts to meddle in things and the three unite to fight for what's theirs. Add in some romance when Billy and Hilda actually fall in love and the two brothers are both after a female wrestler, and you've got a nice comedy British style. I found it enjoyable (even if sometimes a bit over the top). If, like me, you are interested because of Rufus Sewell: He doesn't play a leading role, but shows up quite often. He's very funny, quite ruthless at first, later very romantic, and it's fun to see him in an early role. I'd say the series is worth its money for lovers of British comedy in general, as well as Rufus Sewell-fans.",1271980800,10,1277,4.484978540772532
