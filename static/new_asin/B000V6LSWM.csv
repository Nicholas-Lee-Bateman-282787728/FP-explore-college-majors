8216729,2,B000V6LSWM,"Well, I was dissapointed, mostly by the music.  There were some very nice wintery scenes but the music seemed very ""canned"" and didn't often seem to fit the scene in view.  Also, so many close-ups of christmas ornaments!  If I use this DVD in the future, I will mute the sound and put on my own Christmas music.",1223424000,5,311,4.327586206896552
