8240010,4,B001139ZH4,"This French film's original title is ""Si je t'aime, prends garde  toi"", a line, of course, which most famously, Carmen sings to Don Jos in the opera ""Carmen"" (and which both of the major protagonists in ""Beware of My Love"" rightly could communicate one to the other!). The tale of two mismatched but passionate people, the male, Samuel (or Sami as he sometimes is called in the film, played by Daniel Duval) of which is, apparently, a displaced Turk or Kurd from Izmir (and not, I wouldn't think, an Arab or Berber from North Africa as some have inferred), who is stateless and without papers or financial means (other than gambling, mooching off the ladies, and selling oriental rugs) in France. He and Muriel (acted by Nathalie Baye), a successful and sophisticated woman of the arts, as writer, film editor, and (whether professionally or as a skilled amateur) classical pianist, encounter each other on the train. Muriel helps Samuel to avoid detection and hence the need to pay for his fare (which he cannot).

Back in Paris, Samuel tracks down Muriel and forces his way into her life and, on her own terms, into her heart. However, Samuel is very abusive, jealous, and excessively assertive. The remainder of ""Beware of My Love"" consists of the constant struggle of Samuel to dominate Muriel, who, although she makes love with him frequently and appreciates his physical assets as a lover (and Duval, even as a man in late middle age, the film dating from 1998, is in great physical shape, as one can appreciate in his frequent full frontally buck-naked appearances), she becomes impatient with his Middle Eastern machismo and even mocks him in a way that is very unsettling to Samuel. Needless to say, Muriel's very carnal and, to an extent, caring love for Samuel evaporates in the face of his aggressivity and dangerously unpredictable moods and behaviour. By film's end they separate, once for all. Muriel simply is too self-assured and independent to let Samuel dominate her as, inevitably and repeatedly, he desires (despite some protestations on his part occasionally to the contrary) that she accept him, unconditionally, as lover.

The film's eroticism and other depicted behaviour will seem brutal at times and bewilderingly errant to many Anglophone viewers; this kind of lived-out existentialist angst comes more naturally to the French (and to those of some other latin cultures) than it does to audiences in Canada, aside from Qubec, and the U. S. of A. If one likes French cinema of this sort, be assured that the film is a worthy specimen of the genre, a work of art, not (despite all the nudity and overt sex) one that is merely pornographic. The DVD is subtitled in English, fairly well despite some errors here and there (an hilariously inappropriate one being ""gay"" for what the French intends as ""guy"" at one point!). If the viewer is up to such fare, which hardly is rare in French cinema, this film is for him or for her.",1410134400,3,2950,4.8376237623762375
