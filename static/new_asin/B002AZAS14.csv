8360581,2,B002AZAS14,I was looking for a real yoga DVD to do with my son. I bought it more for the family DVD then for the kids. The family yoga is very short less than 15 minutes. The posses we okay and a few we really did enjoy. The kids DVD is longer and the posses are okay. The instructor's rendition of I'm a Little a Tea Pot looked out of a Vegas Showgirl audition not a kids yoga DVD. My 2 1/2 year old stayed interested in the whole video - although obviously he couldn't do a lot of the posses - but I wouldn't expect that from any yoga video.,1274659200,,532,3.8454545454545452
8360582,5,B002AZAS14,"As a practitioner and teacher of the healing arts, long I have pondered how best to introduce the benefits of yoga to the youth of this world. In Dashama's video ""Kids Yoga Adventure & Yoga Family Funtime"" that query reaches a peaceful conclusion. Never before have I seen such an exquisite presentation of the many facets of yoga displayed in such simple (and fun!) methods of practice for every member of the family to enjoy. To every parent who wishes for their children a balanced and miraculous life, please heed the opportunity to introduce them to this beautiful path of Self discovery and Self empowerment. Thank you Dashama for this extraordinary contribution and the benefits humanity will undoubtedly derive. Namaste",1254441600,7,727,5.066666666666666
