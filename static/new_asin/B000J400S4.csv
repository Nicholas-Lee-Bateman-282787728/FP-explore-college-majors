8149168,4,B000J400S4,"I teach a public speaking AND am a vintage culture/TV/movie/clothing fan.  These short (about 10 minutes each) public speaking videos show how everything has changed and yet nothing has changed!  I just showed the video on stage fright to my honors public speaking class and although the fashions were ""alien"" (the best word I can think of to sum it up) pointed out that the suggestions given were then and still are relevant today.  The price is reasonable and provides an interesting contrast to most classroom materials that become dated after just a few years.  I'm not too sure why others would order this program unless they were either a historian or speech teacher, but if you are, this is an affordable item for your repertoire.",1316304000,4,737,4.825396825396825
