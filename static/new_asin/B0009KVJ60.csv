In 1993, Black Belt Magazine declared it one of the best fight flicks ever made, and twenty years later, it still holds up well. Oddly enough, two movies claiming to be its sequel were released in the same year a little while after the original's debut.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Shaolin/dp/B00008G8NL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Shaolin</a>&nbsp;was a sequel in name only, featuring no returning performers and a new storyline but a similar production style. And while that film isn't perfect by any means, it does a lot more things right than the piece of junk I'm reviewing here. ""King of the Kickboxers 2"" features the return of Loren Avedon as the star, albeit in a different storyline with a much lower standard of action and production.

The story: when fighter Billy Edwards (Sean Donahue,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Hunter/dp/B0001KNHPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Hunter</a>) is killed after getting mixed up with a sadistic underground warlord (Ned Hourani,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>), it falls to his best friend David Carster (Avedon) to protect Billy's girlfriend (Michelle Locke) and avenge his death.

I was expecting the bad acting, roundly dreadful as it may be, but I wasn't expecting half of Loren Avedon's lines to be noticeably dubbed by another performer. I was expecting the low-budget, made-in-the-Philippines production, but I wasn't expecting the filmmakers to get basic things like correct scene-to-scene blocking wrong (e.g. a performer somehow travels ten feet between shots to fall off an escarpment). I was expecting the soundtrack to be forgettable, but dang if it doesn't stand out for its invasiveness as a mixture of repetitive lounge music and weird sound effects. And though the movie only runs for approximately 90 minutes, the story feels overlong and convoluted, with strange and unnecessary plot inserts galore, like David being paranormally contact by his dead friend no less than three times . It's just not very engaging.

The same can be said about the majority of the fight action. Though there's no shortage of it with sixteen brawls going on, very few of these are any good. The fighting cast also includes ex-kickboxer Greg Douglass (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-Steel/dp/6302858526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of Steel</a>) among others, but even with a large collection of talent, the fisticuffs don't amaze: the action is oftentimes sloppy and uncoordinated, as though only the loosest choreography had been planned, and the overlong brawls aren't filmed very dynamically. These faults temporarily lift near the end of the film when Loren Avedon invades the villains' hideout and takes on a horde of thugs in a respectable randori, but the problems return promptly for the two final showdowns.

""King of the Kickboxers 2"" isn't quite so helplessly bad that it deserves a one-star rating, but it's not far off. While the movie may appeal to folks who have grown up on this style of cheap adventure, it cannot hope to match the quality of its predecessor-in-name, even with the lead star at the helm. Leave this one be.",1363046400,,3586,6.194779116465863
8062921,2,B0009KVJ60,"As I have stated before in my previous comments, I hate giving martial arts movies bad reviews as I am not picky when it comes to watching them. I knew before I purchased this it was going to be B-grade but I didn't realize the movie would come with poor quality. As many of you might know, this is an early movie of Loren Avedon's and majority of his action scenes in his movies are packed with explosive...excellent kicking skills and fight scenes. The fight scenes aren't that great. The storline was ok but it reminded me a lot of 'A Dangerous Place' starring Ted Jan Roberts and mixed with No Retreat No Surrender starring Kurt Mckinney put together.",1202601600,,655,4.512605042016807
8062922,3,B0009KVJ60,"I just got this DVD from ebay and expected a lot better from Loren Avedon. He is an awesome kicker on camera and most of his techniques that he used were shocking! I am a big fan of his and have been for a long time because I have always been a major martial arts movie buff. The film was horribly mimmed and although with plenty of action, I wasn't that keen on this movie as it is very B-Grade and you could tell that there wasn't much money involved in the production of this movie. The screenplay was ****house and the acting was incredibly bad. The only good thing about this film is that Loren Avedon is in it.

This is a good plot, too bad about the movie. Billy (Sean Donahue) is a young and ambitious fighter with high plans for his future but all is taken away from him when his sister Judith is brutally attacked by a gang. During the rape, Judith hits her head on a hard rock whilst being thrown down which causes her to lose sight. When Billy learns that Judith is in desperate need for surgery, he goes to crime boss Russell and begins fighting in illegal kickboxing fights for him in order to pay for the surgery. When Billy realizes that he is in too deep and decides to quit, he is killed by Russell and his men (who were the ones responsible for Judith's rape). David (Loren Avedon) is a close friend of Billy as they train in martial arts together and is visited by Billy's spirit on the night of his death, begging David to seek revenge on Russell and his gang for what they did to him and his sister. David goes to Murphy (Greg Douglass) who was David's trainer in the fights and is employed by Russell. Murphy gets David in shape and begin their journey to vengeance.

I only gave this three stars because the action and I don't like to give martial arts movies bad results but unfortunately, there are some bad martial arts movies out there. If you are a major martial arts movie buff like myself and out for new fight scenes and action then go ahead, If not don't waste your money.",1159142400,,2005,4.273684210526316
