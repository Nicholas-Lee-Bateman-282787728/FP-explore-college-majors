7562836,4,B01953CKZ0,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but 2 little things stopped that.
1. it does not start on its own. it has a advertisement in the beginning but then goes to the play menu and you have to hit play.
2. after it is done it does not start over by itself like many other kids dvds
Other that that it is cute and my daughter loves it",1459036800,,324,3.710144927536232

7562838,5,B01953CKZ0,"Kate and Mim-mim is a must own. I like how Kate figures out a problem with her imaginary friends that lines up with a real world problem she's trying to solve, and it's believable the way it's presented. It's not overwhelming yet keeps their attention with slightly shorter stories. I like the positive messages like friendship, problem solving, working together, helping each other and asking for help. Great addition to our collection.",1457395200,,437,5.083333333333333

8743978,5,B01953CKZ0,"This is the story of a young girl who loses touch with reality due to her neglectful parents.
Kate's parents frequently look for an opportunity to abandon her to her own vices so she frequently embarks on escapist fantasies involving her stuff rabbit. The deeper she spirals into madness the more help she needs from the color characters that litter her mind and ends up learning the life lessons that her parents need to be teaching her.
When reality returns she frequently approaches her parents with details of these fantasies, but they just smile and nod.

It also has colorful animation.",1476489600,,592,4.861386138613861
