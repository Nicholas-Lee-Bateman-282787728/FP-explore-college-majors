8401392,4,B000065KLS,"Just to let readers know this is NOT K2, the story about some mountaineers.
It's the comedic Love After Death tale of Karmina, the Transylvanian vampiress who fled to Montreal to escape an arranged marriage.  Vlad, her prospective husband, was sent by her parents to track her down and bring her home but along the way they both found they had more to live for and each found love, albeit not to each other. This is their continuing tale of involving the friends they made along the way and the essential liquid that keeps them immortal among mortals.
A happy comedy well-played, especially the role of Vlad reprised by Yves Pelletier. The dialogue looses nothing in the translation from Transylanian to French to English. Watch for the outakes at the end.",1046131200,,756,4.770992366412214
