8320924,3,B001MBTSW2,I just wasted 20 bucks on this DVD. I watched some of DIG's videos on YouTube and thought I would see alot more on his DVD. I bought DIG's DVD thinking I would see clips of the whole Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. All it showed was clips from Montana and about half of Idaho. Trust me folks you will see alot more on his YouTube channel. You could've done alot better DIG.,1323907200,,375,4.1506849315068495

I only wish there was more of it! How about a sequel? Anxiously awaiting your next production!",1235260800,,262,4.9772727272727275
