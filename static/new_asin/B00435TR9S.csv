It is an old movie and although I am a super fan of Chinese movies, especially anything with martial arts involved, this one was too corny for me.",1477958400,,253,4.361702127659575

8414185,4,B00435TR9S,Very fun and funny movie.  I don't know if they meant it to be funny but it was funny.  Very 1980s.  Sound effects were so anime.  Makes me wonder who the producers were.  Corny Kung Fu Movie worth some popcorn.,1473552000,,211,4.175

8414188,5,B00435TR9S,"This movie has many titles, under this title, one will be confused on which one to buy since there are 2 parts.

Its better to buy Wolfen Ninja & Wolfen Ninja 2 - else where by online research. Amazon only has part one or is it part 2 only - don't remember but I had to order it online else where like kung fu movies dot net.

The story is pretty good, except for some retarded comedy parts, there are many fights in this movies. Its bad ass - 80's style with action in the fighting.

I give this movie 6 stars out of 5 - except for a few boring parts.

I ordered the Uncut Version - english dubbed.",1308182400,,599,3.966666666666667
