6758283,1,B00OP42KRS,"this low budget clunker is an embarrassment all around, the girl playing Brittany is a frumpy looking thespian with limited acting range who bears no resemblance to the real Brittany, the movie covers the first 10 years of her career in about 15 minutes.  The rest of the movie is from around 2004 onward in which her career is heading in a downward spiral.  Too bad that a talented actress like Brittany is portrayed with such banal material as this.",1425772800,6,451,4.625
6758284,1,B00OP42KRS,"This movie did nothing for Brittany. None of the actors acted or looked like their real life counterparts, least of all the girl who played Brittany. A waste of everyone's time.",1425081600,6,177,4.741935483870968

6758289,1,B00OP42KRS,"I do not have the DVD, as it has not yet been released.  I did though record this on FIOS.  It was awful.  The acting was some of the worst I've seen.  The movie seems to almost show you clips of things that everyone has already heard or read about.  It just seems to have skipped everything important.  I always give stuff a chance, but this is one of the few things I could not even finish watching.  Such a shame.  A beautiful, talented human who gets a biography that seems, at least to me, to have been made fast to just make money.

Note that this is unauthorized.  Also, the film was shot VERY fast.  I believe the entire film was shot in less than 30 days.  I am not 100% on that.

Awful movie that at no point does Murphy justice.  It is almost like a bad high school play with actors who can not act.",1416096000,15,810,4.044303797468355
8684391,1,B00OP42KRS,"Th plot was cheesy with unreal super-sweet mother-daughter bond. I'm not a big hollywood fan. But I did notice that the late Brittany Murphy had the X-factor. She was beautiful and a good actress. The actress who played Brittany did not do her justice. She was unattractive,  too fat and a bad actress. Okey, I'm being nice there. Honestly,  I think she was downright ugly and a horrible actress. How did she become an actress? So I went online to read reviews and see if it was only me. Boy, was I glad a lot of people think this girl was ugly. I am with Brittany's father, Lifetime insulted the memory of his daughter. Sue them!",1502064000,,630,4.422413793103448

8684394,1,B00OP42KRS,The actress portraying Murphy looks nothing like her. The entire makes the late actress seem pathetic. Even bad by Lifetime movie standards.,1476316800,,140,5.409090909090909
8684395,4,B00OP42KRS,"The actress who plays Brittany in this movie did a good job but she doesn't do justice to the real Brittany. Brittany had a unique sparkle, a very special quality that only Meg Ryan & Goldie Hawn share with her. She is pure magic & I she is greatly missed by all who love her.",1471046400,,276,4.036363636363636
8684396,1,B00OP42KRS,"Bad wigs, bad acting, tons of mistakes in the story. Ugly, chubby girl portraying Brittany instead of someone petite.",1461456000,,117,5.2105263157894735
8684397,1,B00OP42KRS,"Movie glosses over the 10yrs where Brittany was at the top of her game. It chooses to focus on the end were Brittany was suffering from multiple health issues (none of which where caused by drugs, etc....also Brittany kept her loyalty to her fans up to her last days). Cast was horrible. Main actress was NOT anything like the Brittany we came to love from her movies & interviews. I am a huge fan & hate that I don't own a bio movie about her. I simply refuse to throw my $ towards this trash.  I did read in several articles thatit was filmed in a very, very short period of time.  Also I read an interview where the main actress said she simply had two days to research and prepare for her part in the movie.  Why except a roll when you are not qualified to play the person you're portraying? I am baffled.",1452988800,4,809,4.2064516129032254
8684398,5,B00OP42KRS,"I watched this movie on TV a while back with my neighbor, and then she asked if I could order it for her.  She and her daughter really love this movie about the life of Brittany Murphy.",1447372800,,185,4.0
