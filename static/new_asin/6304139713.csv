7863861,4,6304139713,"A great many of us will be familiar with the image of Hugh Hefner (Founder and Publisher of Playboy magazine) at one of his famous parties. We can picture in our mind's eye Hef walking around Playboy Mansion in his robe  and pajamas, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other. (Actually, Hef  usually smoked a pipe. But for the sake of argument, we'll say it was a  cigarette.) He's smiling. He's mingling. He's making small talk, with  amusing bon mots and double entendres.
Now imagine that, instead of a  robe and pajamas, Hef is decked out in attire that would have been  fashionably casual for an affluent male in the 1960s. And while keeping  everything else the same (the cigarette, the cocktail, the utterly casual  attitude), imagine Hef in the underground lair of an evil Arch-Villain who  is ready to visit death and destruction across the globe. Oh, and make Hef  a James Bond-esque spy.
You now have the basic feel for the four Matt  Helm movies, of which ""The Silencers"" (1966) was the first and  ""The Wrecking Crew"" was the fourth (and last).  (The others were  ""Murderer's Row"" and ""The Ambushers."")
The Matt Helm  movies were made as star vehicles for Dean Martin. By the mid-60s, Dino had  cemented his reputation as a boozing playboy, and the Matt Helm role was  written with this in mind. In the movies, Matt Helm is a boozing, affable,  world-famous photographer of beautiful women who works for  ""Slaymate"" magazine (which fits in nicely with the Hugh Hefner  analogy...). BUT THAT'S JUST A COVER!  Helm is REALLY a boozing, affable  super-competent secret agent for the Intelligence Counter Espionage (ICE)  organization. And in all four movies, he casually wanders his way through  whatever the bad guys have to throw at him as though he were looking for  the nearest bar.
I should point out that the Matt Helm movies are all  pretty bad. But they're wonderfully bad, and they're great, cheezy, campy  fun. I tend to speak glowingly of the Matt Helm movies because I enjoy them  for their over-the-top campiness, but more serious-minded viewers will  probably be turned off.",962064000,21,2101,4.823033707865169
