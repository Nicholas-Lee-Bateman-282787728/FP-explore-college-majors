5742081,5,B00CUKTGQM,"The story of Mahanagar aka The Big City is about how a conservative middle-class family in Calcutta is affected when financial circumstances require that the wife should also take up a job. The film looks at it from two aspects:
1) The impact on the other family members - the loving but traditional husband, his orthodox parents, the young child (They all have reservation to some extent, and the only unequivocal supporter is the husband's kid sister, who sees it as a projection of her own ambitions)
2) The changes in the woman herself - how she grows from a shy house-bound wife to a more confident worldly-wise person.

Without any arty pretensions, but with the sharpness of observation and empathy towards the characters which are his strongest assets, Ray paints a very tangible portrait of this little personal revolution in the traditional family. Of course he is here immensely aided by the marvelous chemistry between the gorgeous Madhabi Mukherjee and Anil Chatterjee - their husband-wife relationship is a very credible and heartwarming picture of romance and friendship, mischief and responsibility. While some reality-obsessed curmudgeons may find the film's end unduly optimistic, it is a very well-placed happy ending, representing the never-say-die spirit of hope over adversity that keeps humanity alive. Ray's touch is very much evident in the screenplay and the visuals - many times, more is conveyed than said, with the use of beautiful visual metaphor or plain restraint, allowing the sensibility of the audience to fill in the gap. For this film he also composed the score, which is lovely and worth hearing on its own. All in all, highly recommended.

Video-wise Criterion's blu-ray is sourced from another amazing restoration (taking a 2K scan of the original negative) from RD Bansal / Pixion (Chennai). Sometimes, the brightness levels seem very high, although there are no blown whites; it might have something to do with the intended look or the shooting conditions. The encode itself is excellent to mine eye, with no apparent digital artefacts. The mono sound is clear and robust and the music comes across quite nicely. I have not seen Kapurush, the short feature presented as an extra on this disc, but the other stuff is quite nice - a critic's video essay talking about the film, Madhabi Mukherjee reflecting on her experience, a Films Division short by BD Garga on Satyajit ray, which briefly looks at the shooting of Mahanagar.",1382918400,11,2467,5.073891625615763
5742082,5,B00CUKTGQM,"I was In India on my 5th trip in 3 years recently when this was shown to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its release. For me I was at the end of a long journey when I happened to catch this on a great screen in my hotel. I think in many ways it is the most astonishing film I have ever seen. Precisely because of what one previous reviewer says is Rays' inimitable gifts at catching the emotions of people close up without have to use any words. I found it particularly intense as my tours have all been musical in nature and the entire way that I go about interacting with people has been without words. A feat that has been surprisingly easy to access.
  However, to see Ray capture the heart and humanity of so many of the Indian people I have been fortunate to interact with was too much emotionally for me. I couldn't make it to the end, as the scene in the coffee shop was so intense (imagining the pain of the husband hearing his wife's description of his job) I just couldn't bare the emotional intensity anymore.
  His own music composed for the film ,beautiful and sparingly applied ,reminds me of the sensitive and subtle ways that so much of the food in India is so delicately spiced and is perfect in a way that no soundtrack I have participated in equals. Having created or played in the soundtracks of over 90 major motion pictures I don't think I have ever sensed such a perfect wedding of cinematic views with music .
  A revelation, as my love for film has always been huge, it actually made me plan to visit the school that is dedicated to his films and teaching, to perform and also to learn more on how to craft films myself as I now am lucky enough to have a pro level dslr and requisite equipment.
  As much as certain films can be the lynchpin for those wanting to delve deeper into this field, the humanistic and deep sensitivity of Rays vision in this film will I hope be as moving for you as it was for me. (and I intend to purchase so that I can watch the rest of it!).
  Also , as I am in love with the colors of India (among many other aspects),though at times (frequently) this can also be overwhelming,,by creating this in b/w with the grainy aspect of film of the period ,it actually makes it in a different way ,,even more deep and colorful !",1378598400,5,2282,4.261574074074074

8586604,5,B00CUKTGQM,"I am mainly discussing the QUALITY of the Criterion transfer. I had the original SONY almost perfect VHS. This one is even better. Sharp and clear; I opted not to get the Blu-Ray version for I don't know how much improvement one can make to this black and white film from the 60s and made in India. A five star effort
Just a few words on the movie itself: it is middle of the road Ray. A veritable feminine triumph story but in Ray's hands, it is curiously ambivalent. The heroine would rather stay home and take care of her son than be out in the wilderness of Calcutta's fashion world selling cosmetics. Her husband's (Anil Chatterji) attitude changes within moments of his losing his job. His acting is the worst part of the movie: and significantly he never appeared in another Ray movie. On the other hand, Madhabi remains Ray's greatest triumph (yes, more than Sharmila) in this and Charulata.
Great crieterion disc; and a far from Satyajit's top movies.
By the way, the short Kapurush movie is a masterpiece. It lingers in memory. Madhabi and Soumitra with their understated charms and acting make it a top class Ray.",1435017600,2,1124,4.625

8586607,4,B00CUKTGQM,"4 1/2 stars -- American audiences are unlikely to be bothered by the rather upbeat ending of the narrative in Satyajit Ray's 1963 film.  It's the kind of ending they hanker for in much less interesting movies, and it has a nice feminist kick to it too.  But if you compare ""The Big City"" to the movies Fellini was making in Italy around the same time, it's clear that Fellini is casting a colder eye on the state of post-war Italy than Ray is casting on post-independence India.  There's a sense in this movie that modernization and urbanization offer opportunity, for women as well as men, in a new economic world and that taking a place in that new world will lead to a reconfiguration of traditional social roles that among other things, for example, seem to suggest that older citizens have little to offer their community and that a woman's place is to reinforce these older social patterns.  Thus, as this movie opens, Arati Mazumdar (Madhabi Mukherjee) seems fixed in a world where she has to run a household consisting of her husband, her child, her husband's teenage sister, and her husband's aging parents -- and all this on the modest salary that her husband (Anil Chatterjee) earns as a bank-clerk.  Expenses mount -- the teenager's education, the father-in-law's medical needs -- and things come to a point where Arati decides that she must take a job to help make ends meet.  Neither her in-laws nor her husband is happy at the prospect: this is just not done in traditional families, and her husband eventually relents but makes it clear that he will seek additional part-time work that could make his wife's working unnecessary if he can find a part-time job.  Arati gets a job selling knitting machines as a door-to-door saleswoman -- and she finds that she's good at it, and her sense of her worth grows as she comes to consider herself a contributor to the family's economy -- but there comes a point where she has to face a decision to resign, because her father-in-law has ceased to talk to her husband over what he sees as the outrage of Arati's working.  Arati goes to work one day with her letter of resignation in her purse . . . and I'll stop there to avoid spoilers!

The strength of the movie for me lies in the way Ray pays attention to the texture of the family life of Arati and her husband.  It's a bit like the way Mike Leigh takes his time in letting us see a family in a domestic space that enables us to understand their limitations and strengths (although Ray's movie is shot in black-and-white, while Leigh typically shoots in color).  The family is clinging to respectability under economic stress, but the design of the interior of their living quarters makes clear the sacrifices in dignity and privacy that they are living with.  For all that, they treat one another with great respect, and Ray's script gives each of the characters his or her own distinct personality and respects that too.  The airier spaces of the office from which Arati works, and the sense of space in the houses at which she sells her machines bespeak a way of life that is freer and more appealing, and Ray makes sure that we realize that Arati registers these differences in environment.  The world of corporate capitalism is not the enemy here, and that perhaps is part of what makes the story sentimental.  Arati's boss makes a decision late in the movie that causes a crisis for Arati, but he's presented on the whole as a reasonable and attractive figure, and nowhere else in the movie, really, is there the suggestion that capitalism and consumerism might have their own problems.

The disagreements between Arati and her husband don't really threaten the marriage -- they are presented as a loving couple -- and one can well believe that without the in-law presence, Subrata  would not raise any great objection to Arati's working if she wanted to.  But they do threaten the larger unit, and that unit matters to both.  An important part of the movie makes clear how Arati's father-in-law (Haren Chatterjee) believes he should be taken care of: as a retired teacher, he goes around to now-prosperous ex-pupils (a dentist, a doctor) and basically asks them for money or services on the grounds that if it had not been for him, they wouldn't be the successes they are.  He does this without any obvious sense of shame but seems to feel rather that he is entitled, and the ex-pupils seem to accept his request without a whole lot of fuss.  What we're seeing here, I think, is a model of an older way in which a community could work that still has some moral purchase ten years or so after independence and the beginnings of modernization.  Even Arati's boss (Haradhan Banerjee) seems to recognize ties that are more than merely contractual and commercial.  When Arati's husband visits the office late in the movie, he and her boss realize that they grew up in the same region.  On that basis, the boss offers Subrata a job -- a job he had not come to the office to seek -- again suggestive of an older way of doing business that is still current and not really presented as being at odds with the newer capitalism.  It turns out, that the boss has his blind spots and prejudices, and they lead to the moment of decision for Arati at the end, but these late scenes don't undercut (and maybe even reinforce) the continuing power, for better and worse, of older ways.

So it's a fascinating movie.  The acting is just fine, with Madhabi Mukherjee's Arati being a luminous presence throughout.  She's a strikingly beautiful woman -- heck, I would buy a knitting machine from her -- and yet she inhabits the role of Arati very comfortably and credibly.  The other striking performance is from Haren Chatterjee as the father-in-law, who makes us understand a way of operating in the world that seems strange in the West by playing it as naturally as you could wish.  The intervening years since the 1960's have tended to validate Fellini's cooler gaze rather more than Ray's optimism, but you can enjoy the sentiment and appreciate the specificity of the presentation too.",1424736000,2,6087,4.661682242990654

8586609,4,B00CUKTGQM,"Prior to Criterion restoring the film it was almost hard to look at due to sparkles. Now it is as good as new. It is a wonderful story about women entering the work world in a society that frowns upon it, and about a husbands support in the face of criticism from parents and society. Satyajit Ray is considered one of the worlds greatest directors, so I have tried to see as many of them as I could and consider this one the best of all. The 5 extra items on the dvd are all worth watching too. The only negative is that the English subtitles for the ending scene were changed and lose the emotional punch that the original subtitles presented.",1383955200,10,645,4.295081967213115
