2239370,4,B0007R4T1M,"Star Creatures is a goofy black and white knock off of Abbott and Costello Goes To Mars. there's some hot alien ladies in the cast. And lots of goofy comedy.

Invasion of the Bee Girls is a tempting piece of 70s scifi about women who wear big sunglasses. unlike the first feature - this is not meant to be seen by small children. The women are extra hot in this creepy low budget film where the men can't handle the pleasures of the new gals in town.

Both transfers are in fine shape. Good trashy drive in fun.",1134432000,24,511,4.204081632653061

2239387,3,B0007R4T1M,"Surprise, Its a Cult Source for the X-Files
CF

I can't believe I watched the whole thing... Why, oh why did I do it?

Hello, it's apparently some kind of crazy cult source for the X-Files!  Who knew?

There's the semi-strange scientist talking about his offbeat theories... his name is Henry Murger.  Like Mulder, that's one letter off from the word ""murder.""  (You knew that about Mulder, right?)  Murger however is not the super-cool investigator, that role's played by a William Smith, but the Smith character has his cute strict lady scientist partner who becomes his girlfriend... neither the Fox Mulder character, nor John Belushi's King Bee skit, will ever be the same for me.

There's the mutated bees, the black eyes of the alien-hybrid humans altered through secret genetic experiments; the same style of alien sets (a geodesic shape over a body in the middle of a roomful of panels crammed with dials)... there's the roomful of clones, there's even a secret room with fishtanks... The character of Herb Kline, played by a Ben Hammer whom I'd swear I drove in my cab to Market and Third just a few weeks ago, maps to Assistant Director Skinner - the balding swarthy type.

Basically, the town of Peckham, California is being ravaged by girls genetically altered with bee DNA who fornicate men to death.  That's how Murger goes, that's how Kline goes.  Unbelievable camp... all the investigator can think to ask the lady mad scientist is how many times a queen bee mates.  The answer is, ""Once,"" and he lets her return to her mad scientist work.  I'll have to tell my cab-driving colleague Elwyn Peckham about this if I ever see him again, but I haven't seen him since my 1998 concert, which he attended.

There's some nudity, not all of it satisfactory, meant to be supersexy, though it isn't always.  Some details are bizarre - one of the alien girls has an extra ball in the palm of her hand; no context or reason for this is given.  There are other flashes.

Watch this if you know the X-Files fairly well, I think you'll agree there are a great many correspondences.  Or, don't watch it... save your time... save your money.  As a former paperboy delivering the Sacramento Bee, I had to watch it...",1397088000,,2213,4.686528497409326
2239388,4,B0007R4T1M,"What could be better. Bought it because lost my Bee Girls, (I had a bad year) and haven't seen Star Creatures yet. Its on the list this Halloween. But Bee Girls does combine Sexy Girls with a Film Noir investigation. Not much on background, and to warn those not ready, one of the final scenes is very erotic. Be warned!",1381536000,2,320,4.35
2239389,4,B0007R4T1M,"Forget Invasion of the Star Creatures, one of the most unfunny, so-called comedies ever.  There is nothing wrong with Black and White, so long as the movie is good, which Star Creatures is not.  Invasion of the Bee Girls on the other hand, is a very good story, written by Nicholas Meyer, screenwriter of The Seven Per-Cent Solution, Time After Time, The Human Stain, co-screenwriter of Star Trek IV and Star Trek VI.  It may have been made on a low-budget, but it is pretty good, just the same. The acting is not bad at all.  Because of the large amount of nudity, this is a film for adults, but so what, kids don't have to see everything. Since Star Creatures takes up half the DVD, I took off a star to an otherwise good movie.  The four stars are for Bee Girls, less the negative one star for Star Creatures.",1372636800,,812,4.3509933774834435

2239411,3,B0007R4T1M,"The ""....Bee Girls"" was one of those ""C"" drive-in movies that we went to see as teenagers just because it was R-rated and there were nude women in it.  The story is terrible (obviously) and the only reason you would probably want to see this movie again was because it brought back memories of going to the drive-in with your friends.  The movie I wanted was STAR CREATURES and was dissapointed that some of the scenes were cut.  I'm not sure why they cut them out, but, oh well!  The only thing that salvages this DVD release is that STAR CREATURES is in it's original wide screen version.  Made from a good quality print, too!!",1316131200,2,629,4.434782608695652
2239412,4,B0007R4T1M,"This could be the most bizarre pairing in the history of the MIDNITE MOVIES double feature series. INVASION OF THE STAR CREATURES is basically a goofy kid movie, full of silly gags and slapstick. G-rated fare. INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS is an early 70s cult / soft core movie about mutant bee-babes that kill men through lethal shagging. Loaded w/ nudity and marshmallow creme, the bee gals are certainly adult friendly, but you might want to send the kids to bed! Interesting match-up...",1267228800,2,487,4.809523809523809
2239413,4,B0007R4T1M,"MGM does a good job with these Midnight Movie double features, and this one is no exception.

If you're like me, youve got a fair amount of Cult and Grindhouse movies on DVD. These DVDs can be really shoddy on quality and a lot of the time are taken from old VHS transfers in full screen. Sometimes the movie itself is worth sitting through in spite of thses inferior transfers, sometimes not. But MGM usually provides a superior product in this market (although they have been known to heavily edit/censor these movies for content in some cases). Both films here are well presented.

The real draw feature here is Invasion of the Bee Girls. Have no fear sleaze fan, this movie delivers on it's R-rated promise. Russ Meyer would've been proud to include most of the female cast here in his features. Of particular note is the transformations scene involving multiple women and some marshmallow cream.

The other movie, Invasion of the Star Creatures is a throw away, though I guess it's not as terrible as some I've seen. Unlike the real attraction here it is completely devoid of bared-buxom-beauties.",1260144000,9,1102,4.7894736842105265
2239414,4,B0007R4T1M,"This one is a must see for bad ""B"" movie enthusiasts. It has all the earmarks of a classic. Gratuitous nudity, terrible acting and totally unbelievable technology. I loved it.",1252540800,2,175,4.866666666666666
2239415,5,B0007R4T1M,"If you're a fan of bad campy comedy, Invasion of the Star Creatures is a classic.",1245628800,2,81,4.125
2239416,5,B0007R4T1M,"Two movies in one.  The first one is one I never heard of.  Invasion of the Star Creatures.  This movie is funny but has the feel of somebody hiring a friend of a friend of a friend.  Or maybe hiring your aunt or your stepsister.  The actors and actresses can't be judged poorly when you realize what material they had to start with.  It is bad but in some way it was meant to be bad.  This is not a serious film.  The main plot is two female aliens are the vanguard of a invasion of Earth.  They have advanced weapons and plant men to help them.  No, really, plant men.  They just grew their soldiers.
The second film was Invasion of the Bee Girls.  This one I had on tape and just wanted to replace it so I could watch it without having to rewind all the time.  Maybe I am too lazy?  This film is also funny, not to be taken seriously no matter what somebody tries to tell you.  Some nudity and sexual scenes give this movie a R rating.  The plot to this one is harder to explain - it has to do with trying to mate with males but failing -  and really didn't need bees in it.  But if you like bees like me, well, that's OK too.
Get it used.  No extras.
Yes, I gave it a five out of five.  The titles are telling you what you are going to get.  It is funny, full of camp and not much else.",1234742400,4,1290,3.9034749034749034
2239417,5,B0007R4T1M,"This motion picture hit theaters on June 1, 1973 starring the gorgeous Former Price is Right Model Anitra Ford as Doctor Susan Harris, William Smith as Agent Neil Agar and Victoria Vetri as Julie Zorn. It's a nice sunny day in a small town called Peckham in Southern California where the cleaning lady is going around cleaning rooms at a local motel. When she opens a motel room door lying on the floor dead is a local scientist from the Brandt Research Laboratory. Enters Agent Neil Agar who was sent to California and this small town to find out what's going on. The deeper Agent Agar investigation goes the more murders he uncovers. Enters Doctor Susan Harris who's another doctor that works at the place Brandt Research Laboratory and she's doing a study on bees. Now Agar has to find out why all the man in this little is dieing and he needs to find out now. Now some thoughts on this picture. I have mixed emotions on grading this picture because theme and the plot was dumb and this picture at the beginning was very slow to develop. William smith was bad in his role as Agent Neil Agar, but he didn't seem to be real interested in shooting this film. I can't even remember Victoria Vetri role as Julie Zorn, that's how bad her acting was. However, the star of this picture and the reason why I bought was Anitra Ford. She was excellent in this movie and her talents were wasted. The scene where she starts ********* in the living room was simply gorgeous. Anitra knew she had a gorgeous body and she knows how to show it off and more. Therefore, even though this movie was a dumb science fiction I give this picture 10 weasel stars and not on the movie but on Anitra Ford.",1218499200,3,1680,4.422580645161291
2239418,2,B0007R4T1M,"I don't know why these 2 films were put together on a disc. ""Star Creatures"" is totally silly, suitable for young kids because of the idiot behavior of its loveable, albeit hammy, pair of goofballs. ""Bee Girls"", on the other hand, has equally low production values, more of an exploitation film, so prevalent in the early 70's. It doesn't stink, but doesn't provoke any intelligent thoughts, either. The pre-occupation with sex would definitely not be suitable for kids (though little kids know everything, anyway...) If kids need to see a pre-occupation with sex, let them see ""Tom Jones"". At least it's an excellent adaptation of a classic, and has no crude nudity. These 2 films, on one DVD, lack any discernable comparison...except that both are below avarage.",1171756800,4,764,5.0236220472440944
2239419,4,B0007R4T1M,"(3.5/5 stars) I agree with the other reviewers that this is an odd pairing because ""Invasion of the Star Creatures"" is a black and white movie suitable for nearly all ages, while ""Invasion of the Bee Girls"" is an R-rated movie with sex, nudity and violence. I started to watch ""Invasion of the Star Creatures,"" but it was so bad I could not finish it. Perhaps someday. This is more a review of the flip side, ""Invasion of the Bee Girls"" (aka ""Graveyard Tramps""). Knowing nothing about this prior to viewing it, I was pleasantly surprised. Someone, or some thing, is having sex with the townswomen's husbands until they die (not that the men are complaining). The Bee Girls recruit the townswomen too, making the ""threat"" difficult to contain. Agent Agar (William Smith) is brought in to investigate, giving the movie a semblance of legitimacy. This is the type of neat little movie that doesn't try to overextend itself despite a limited budget. The few special effects are not very elaborate and work well enough for a movie of this scope. The filmmakers recognize the fact most people will not watch this for the special effects or sci-fi components, but rather for gratuitous nudity. On this count it delivers. Yes, it is trashy, but it knows its audience, does well with what it has and is also competent enough to avoid being too easily dismissed. Get this DVD for this movie and consider the other one a bonus.",1157673600,30,1416,4.713709677419355
2239420,3,B0007R4T1M,"Another interesting drive-in double feature from MGM's Midnite Movies line.  But be warned: Although MGM usually does a fine job of pairing similar films, these two are very different.

I was initially most intrigued by INVASION OF THE STAR CREATURES, as I consider myself quite a fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi, and had never even heard of this one.  I wasn't prepared for the sheer silliness of the story.  The best comparison I can draw would be the equally goofy (but much more entertaining) Jerry Lewis sci-fi/comedy VISIT TO A SMALL PLANET.  A pair of Abbott & Costello-types get mixed up with some scantily-clad space babes.  Plot?  I guess there's one in there somewhere, but don't strain too hard.  It's a mildly diverting, cheap little comedy that I'm in no hurry to watch again.

INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS, although similar in title, is actually a bit of 70's drive-in exploitation trash.  The title characters seduce poor Earth-men and kill them, while recruiting busty Earth-women into their ranks.  The sex is strictly softcore stuff, but it's still an odd pairing with such an innocuous piece of fluff like STAR CREATURES.

Honestly, folks, neither of these films is that great.  But I give MGM 3 stars for a first-rate presentation of some fairly obscure films that any serious drive-in afficiando will want in their collection.",1139356800,20,1341,4.906666666666666

Terrific acting, the writing and directing are world class, and like all true Sci-Fi movies, it's very true to life. This watershed work of genius competently answers all questions about Space Aliens, Religion, de-coder rings, Indian dancing, and the effect of idiots on beautiful women.
