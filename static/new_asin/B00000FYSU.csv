1213962,5,B00000FYSU,"I saw this movie several years ago and loved it.  I thought it was suspensful, well acted and a great story.  Liv Tyler, Richard Dryfus and Linda Hamilton all did a wonderful job.  I highly recommend this movie to those who like the suspense/murder mystrey genre.",985046400,6,263,4.673913043478261
1213963,2,B00000FYSU,"Oh man, is this movie ever bad! Richard Dreyfuss, Linda Hamilton and Liv Tyler star in this convoluted yet ultimately stupid stew of tv movie cliches (the troubles of an autistic boy), a murder mystery and ""Fatal Attraction"" with a little ""Lolita"" for spice, because Liv's so hot.  In fact, the only reason I watched this in the  first place was because she's in it!  Curse my manly urges for visiting this film upon me!
 It features one of the most misconceived plot devices yet employed in mainstream cinema- the kid can perfectly imitate any voice he's ever heard, and has a photographic memory, so they overdub his vocals, which turns him into a mini-""Mercury Theatre on the Air"" and the whole movie goes straight into the toilet.  You have to see this scene to believe how horrible it plays.
 Really, if Liv wasn't in this, it'd be a 1-star effort.",980467200,10,853,4.6158940397351
1213964,5,B00000FYSU,"This movie is one of the best sleeper hits ever. with a stunning performance by the little guy, and don't forget, the girl from Armaggedon is  in this movie too. And Richard Dreyfuss gives an excellent performance as  well. I must say the script is a little messy and the film is a little  shaky, but deffinently over way too fast. It actually looks like a real  life crime, with real life People (who make real mistakes like overlooking  certain OBVIOUS clues), so with that in mind it really makes for a sort 48  hours (tv show not movie) aproach to a murder that is ultimately very  intersting and invigorating. Plot: An autistic boy with a bad memory (the  little guy), a teenage girl asleep in her bedroom (the girl from  armaggedon), two parents butchard to death with a large knife that the boy  is left holding when the police and the child psychiatrist (Dreyfuss)  arrives. The case is set and the boy is the only witness, but the only  words he can say are the words he heard from that night. Now a detective (I  think John Litgo) and the psychiastrist along with some women i think is  his wife (Linda Hamilton) Have to find out what the boy knows and protect  him at the same time from the killer, but who is the killer, was it the  boy...or someone else? Sorry about not explaining the characters too much  but its been along time since iv seen it, and it took me forever to find  out where I could buy it, then it dawned on me, AMAZON.COM. anyway, buy  this movie, it is so cool, you'll never figure it out till its too late.",965001600,12,1539,4.336842105263158
1214015,5,B00000FYSU,"Silent Fall is a 1994 thriller about a therapist (Richard Dreyfuss) attempting to help an autistic boy talk about what he saw after the tragic death of both his parents.

The story line is interesting and intense and Richard Dreyfuss, Liv Tyler, and Ben Faulkner all do an excellent job in this movie.

The end has a surprising twist.

Overall, a great movie.",1438992000,,359,4.666666666666667

When a psychiatrist discovers the truth, she tries to murder him too in a horrifying manner. Her excuse? you go it: her father supposedly abused her sexually. Of course.

1214021,4,B00000FYSU,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

SILENT FALL: Dreyfuss is terrific: Wounded, grieving, self-pityingbut unable to stop caring. Tims trouble could spell salvation for them both: Jake needs to help Tim as much as Tim needs his help. Hamilton has little to do, and Lithgow less, but they do it well.

The plot is involved and involving, with one intriguing surprise after another; it builds in intensity and, beneath its surface, explores the thin line between personal and professional behavior, and the risks of crossing that line. Adding electricity are the psychosexual undercurrents that figure prominently in the (multiple) resolutions. All this and the lush landscape photography we expect from Beresford. Theres not a false frame in this filmso why has no one ever heard of it?",1423267200,,1003,4.859649122807017

1214035,5,B00000FYSU,"Why don't they make movies like this anymore? Richard Dreyfuss is superb in this suspense thriller.
The who done it theme is pushed to the limits and the child actor is amazing.
I am proud to add this movie to my library of extraordinary films.",1402531200,2,244,4.444444444444445
1214036,4,B00000FYSU,"This movie presents a top notch cast and generally well done. The very appealing little boy, with large, sad eyes, who was said to be autistic, was (as they did say in the movie) ""high functioning."" As a Psychologist myself I could have entertained another at least co-morbid, if not altogether different, diagnosis for the boy. Granted, he seemed to have some mild autistic traits, but he was also deeply traumatized by events prior to the murder of his parents. How much can a little boy handle without having some pretty serious symptomatology, including catatonia (or, not wanting to say what he knew so not to talk at all?). I tended to dislike the wife, played by Linda Hamilton, although I usually like her acting, and thought that her Halloween costume at the end of the movie was appropos. Richard Dreyfuss was great, as usual, and played out his internal conflicts and role with the boy in a credible way. The teenage daughter was stunning in her somewhat creepy role. Part of the ending was predictable, part of it not so predictable; some of the ending scenes were a bit far-fetched, in my opinion, but hey! it's a movie. All in all, this is good drama.",1398384000,,1165,4.660194174757281
1214037,5,B00000FYSU,Richard dreyfuss does a good job on playing a psychiatrist. The kid does a supurb job on playing a autistic child! Great story! Freaky outcum!,1390780800,,142,4.72
1214038,5,B00000FYSU,"Good  acting,  good  plot.  I like  all  of  the  actors  in  this movie.  It  was  quite interesting. I  will  probably  watch  it  again.",1390176000,,139,4.304347826086956
1214039,5,B00000FYSU,"Great movie. I looked for this movie to be aired on cable for a long time. Then it finally dawned on me to check Amazon, I'm so glad I did. Although this is an older movie my adult grandchildren & their friends really liked it too. If you've never seen this movie, buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1381190400,,299,4.172413793103448
1214040,5,B00000FYSU,One of the best Richard Dreyfus films made ~ the only reason it didn't get big play when it first came out is because of a Tom Cruise film at the same time.,1378080000,,156,3.757575757575758
1214041,5,B00000FYSU,"Not much fireworks in this psychological drama in which Dreyfuss gives a typically fine performance setting a quiet tone for the production. While there are some fireworks before the  movie ends, these are, mixing a metaphor, restrained, in keeping with the constraint of the film. This absence of clanging and banging around allows the substance of the film,  the psychological dimensions of behavior and the difficulties of dealing with illnesses of the mind which never fail to manifest themselves in the body as well,  to become clear to us. Of course, as in the preparation of difficult law cases, when what might take a year in 'real life' is compressed in a play or film, to a quite short period, so, too, with the psychological 'treatment' in this movie, what is a long drawn out period of diagnostic investigation and therapy, of necessity is shortened.
At  any rate, this is quite a good movie for the general audience. Key roles are filled well, some of the subordinate ones less so but still with solid competency. Satisfaction with the film for most viewers will be dependent on the degree to which Dreyfuss registers not only as an intelligent therapist but also upon how convincing he is as a humane and decent person.",1375574400,,1233,4.829383886255924
1214042,5,B00000FYSU,The movie is really good. The outtakes and delete scene were interesting. The picture is ten times better than the VHS version. The movie is worth watching at least once. If you have never seen it before.,1374105600,,204,4.54054054054054
1214043,5,B00000FYSU,"I ordered this movie for my father because he loved it when it came out years ago. It's the story of an autistic boy who has difficulty communicating and feels isolated from others. With encouragement and patience, he eventually feels able to express himself. It is a story of triumph over adversity, which is always a positive message!",1373068800,,336,4.810344827586207
1214073,5,B00000FYSU,excelent!!! I used to watch this movie when I was younger and haven't seeen it in years. I was so excites to see it.,1362787200,,116,3.875
1214074,4,B00000FYSU,"This is one of those great who done it murder mysteries. The parents of an autisic boy are found brutally murdered in their bedroom and the boy is walking around the house covered in blood and carrying the knife that was used in the murder. Forensics quickly prove the boy didn't do it, but only he knows who did and he can't tell. Enter a brilliant yet flawed therapist played by Richard Dreyfuss. Relucantly, he begins to tackle communicating with the boy to discover what actually happened.

With great performances and well written script, this is a well made who done it.",1357603200,,576,4.647058823529412
1214075,2,B00000FYSU,"I bought this movie based on the actors in it, particularly Richard Dreyfus and John Lithgow and the reviews posted on Amazon.  They are both really good actors.  However, I was deeply disappointed.  The movie and the acting was flat.  It was pretty easy to figure out that Liv Tyler was really the star and thus, the killer.  It was not worth the money I paid and will probably not trust the any more Amazon reviews.",1351987200,2,417,4.434210526315789

1214077,4,B00000FYSU,"It has been a long time since I had seen this movie, and I wanted to remember the storyline and plot. It was very well done for that time and even though the picture quality is typical for that time in movie history, it still packs a suspenseful punch. This is an exciting psychological thriller and worth the time it takes to find.",1264032000,,332,4.285714285714286
1214078,4,B00000FYSU,"He will help this boy, and he does use his own voice near the end. Wonderful movie.",1205798400,,83,3.9411764705882355
1214079,4,B00000FYSU,"Richard Dreyfus is always exceptional at portraying all characters - but he especially does well at portraying attorneys and psychologists.  Here he is a psychologist brought in to work with a boy who's witnessed his parents being murdered. The acting is top notch.  As good as Dreyfus is, it is the boy actor who steals the show.

This was a very interesting story.  It has disturbing elements, so it's definately not a family movie.  But I like pyschological thrillers, and this one kept me engaged.  It never drags.  I recommend it.",1134604800,,535,4.813186813186813
1214080,4,B00000FYSU,"Richard Dreyfuss' quiet, restrained performance highlights this durable little thriller from Bruce Beresford, the director of such movies as BREAKER MORANT, DOUBLE JEOPARDY and of course, the Oscar winning DRIVING MISS DAISY.  Dreyfuss portrays a psychologist who finds himself involved in the brutal murder of a couple, whose autistic son was found holding the murder weapon.  Ben Faulkner as little Tim is quite good in his role, with evocative brown eyes and a cherubic little face.  Liv Tyler plays his older sister, who was also at the scene of the crime.  Tyler's first role is a difficult one, and her inexperience shows in her incomplete performance, but she does have a few good moments.  J.T. Walsh shows up as the sheriff who was also having an affair with the boy's mother.  John Lithgow plays a callous doctor who wants to medicate the little boy; Lithgow is pretty much wasted in the role.  Ditto to Linda Hamilton, who shows up as either Dreyfuss' girlfriend or wife, one never knows which.  She seems to have little interest in her role or her performance.  In spite of this, however, SILENT FALL engages the viewer in the whodunit aspect, although the murderer is pretty obvious.  Beautifully filmed in Baltimore County, the movie manages to intrigue and entertain.",1110499200,6,1282,4.976525821596244
1214081,4,B00000FYSU,"The only movie I can really compare Silent Fall to is Mercury Rising, which I have seen several times and never tire of it and have yet to sell my copy. I now regret selling my copy of Silent Fall since Ben Faulkner plays the non-verbal autistic child, Tim quite accurately. It is kind of freaky how both children in these movies resemble my own non-verbal son. Luckily the viewer does not have to witness the murders that take place in the parent's bedroom.

Silent Fall begins in the aftermath at the residence with Tim holding the knife which is presumed to be the murder weapon. The eighteen year-old sister Sylvie is portrayed by Liv Tyler, and hiding in her closet, apparently attacked by the intruder. Supposedly she was shopping at the mall and came home while the murders were taking place.

Law enforcement has enlisted the assistance of a psychiatrist played by Richard Dreyfuss, who immediately informs them the child is autistic and sends one of the officers around the house in search of a deck of cards. At first Jake runs out not wanting to get involved with the case, but a moment later enters the house and is able to render the knife away from Tim.

Since the sister is eighteen the issue of who will take care of Tim is never really addressed, although they did stay with some relative for one day, but the incident at the dinner table resulted in Tim tearing up the kitchen.

I believe this was the first role for Liv Tyler, and her acting was quite rigid at times with no real facial expressions or hints of sadness at the loss of her parents. You could tell the compassion for her brother, but this was by the tone in her voice at times it became higher pitched.

John Lithgow plays Dr. Harlow who uses drugs on patients and is not a friendly type of Doctor. There is some connection between the two Doctors and the Sheriff. A few times Jake brings up the past incident where a former patient who was also autistic and non-verbal committed suicide by jumping in the lake at Jake's residence. It was not fully explained, but from what I gathered this is where it took place. At one point Jake is discussing this child, Billy, with his wife. Linda Hamilton is a lawyer who has a small supporting role. She is instrumental in getting Jake to take on Tim as a patient.

It was never mentioned what the drug was that the other Dr wanted to inject Tim with and I was not positive if the other patient Billy ever had an injection. At times you could see the concern from Sylvie for her brother and at other times she made no sense. I believe Sylvie was going to college during the day while Tim was working with Jake. The house they lived in was very large and creepy at times when they walked up the winding staircase.

Silent Fall did keep me guessing and also questioning some things, but it held my interest the entire time and I was satisfied for the most part with the way autism was presented, especially since it was not a true story and more of a thriller. One disturbing aspect is when Tim is using echolalia and repeating the F word that his father had used toward him.

Richard Dreyfuss did a good job with his performance, although at times it was hard to tell what the character was thinking or feeling. His depiction of a child psychiatrist was believable and he showed interest in the patient and he seemed to have knowledge in the subject of autism. John Lithgow was the Doctor you grew to despise, although his character was under developed.

The best actor in Silent Fall by far was Ben Faulkner, who played the boy, but he did not seem to be a nine-year old since my son is the same age. His blank stares and vocalizing with noises was right on target and gave me goose bumps at times. For those that like mystery thrillers this is a good flick to consider and get a inside look at the world of a non-verbal autistic child with some off the wall scenarios.",1098144000,16,3892,4.417015341701534
1214082,4,B00000FYSU,"This was a very intriguing movie.  I liked it for its plot.  Nice little whodunit.  It was different.  Very quiet movie.  Not slow, just very quiet and steady.  Parents murdered in their bedroom and the only witness is a little boy who's autistic and can't tell what he saw.  Richard Dreyfus, Liv Tyler, and especially the little boy were all good.  Linda Hamilton has a very minor role.  I believe this was Liv Tyler's first movie -- she's not great, but not bad either.",1082592000,15,471,4.511904761904762
