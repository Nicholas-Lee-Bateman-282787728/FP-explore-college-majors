2807180,1,B000P1KPGI,"Sure, I know, Larry Harmon did it first and he owns the character.  But for me the One True Bozo will always be Bob Bell, who portrayed Bozo in Chicago on WGN from the late 60's through the 80's.  Paired with Roy Brown's Cooky, you have one of television's all-time great comedy teams.  If Volume 2 has the Bob Bell episodes, count me in.",1178409600,10,338,4.25

2807190,5,B000P1KPGI,"I have purchased vol 1 + 2 Bozo 30 episode DVDs and they are fantastic and I hope more of Frank Avruch Bozos are released soon as I want to buy all his shows as he was the BEST of all the TV clowns.

 For all those people wanting the Bill Bell versions released I have seen many of his shows that are availible on several bootleg quality DVDs and he is nothing special , in fact after releasing all of the Frank Avruch Bozos I hope the next Bozo they release are the Bill Britton ones as he was the 2nd greatest Bozo next to Avruch who was the King of Bozo.",1216857600,3,557,3.920353982300885
2807191,5,B000P1KPGI,"I'm from Chicago and therefore I am most familiar with the Bob Bell/Joey D'Auria Bozos.  I purchased Volume 2 of the Larry Harmon Bozo the Clown DVD a couple years ago and I must say, Frank Avruch did do a good Bozo.  HOWEVER, if we want to be technical about this whole Bozo ordeal, the original and therefore REAL Bozo was neither Bob Bell or Frank Avruch.  Pinto Colvig was the voice of Bozo when the character started out as a children's storybook and record from Capital Records.  Colvig also was the first LIVE Bozo when KTTV in Los Angeles broadcast the first Bozo show in 1949.  Also, Larry Harmon did not originate the character as I mentioned before, Capital Records was the Bozo originator.  Harmon licensed the character and made the clown as popular as he became with the cartoons and different Bozo shows throughout the country, and of course the merchandise.

Anyway, with all that aside, I now switch back to Chicago's Bozo.  As much as I wish that Bob Bell's Bozo come to DVD, the reality is that this may be more difficult to achieve.  Don't forget that the show was broadcast live from 1961 to 1980 and tapes of these would be scarce if they exist at all!  Of the shows that could be put on DVD would be Ned Locke's final show in July 1976, Bozo's live broadcast from Chicagofest in 1979, the Bozo 25th Anniversary special that aired live from Medinah Temple in 1986, the 30th Anniversary Special, Bozo:  40 Years of Fun, and a special on Bob Bell entitled Bozo:  The Man Behind the Makeup that aired on WGN in 1984 when Bob Bell retired.  Plus let's not forget about the special, ""Bozo, Gar, and Ray"" that airs on WGN every Christmas Season.  These specials were part of the Television Archives at the Museum of Broadcast Communications and I was fortunate to see these shows as well as a few other Bozo shows.  It would be a wonderful treat if these shows did make it to DVD.  I also hope to someday see Bob Bell's last Bozo show in its completion because the tape that the MBC had cut off early, just before the memorable final pie fight Bell participated in as the character (he also participated in the pie fight at the end of the 25th Anniversary special, but as himself since Joey D'Auria was Bozo at the time).  I also have wanted to see some of Joey's first shows as Bozo and how he interacted with Frazier Thomas, who died near the end of Joey's first season as Bozo.

As much as I wish I could see these shows on DVD, they are more wishes than hope.  Anyway, I have not yet purchased these DVDS of Avruch's Bozo, but I do plan on doing so.  I am not betraying my love for Chicago's Bozo because both Bob Bell and Joey D' Auria remain my favorites.  However,  I respect how other actors portray the character and Frank Avruch DOES portray a good Bozo.  It is my hope and wish that I can contribute to what I hope to someday see, and that is the Bozo shows from Chicago that I have seen in archives and the wishes I have for the shows that are not at this known to exist....as of now!",1206144000,32,3012,4.339285714285714
2807192,2,B000P1KPGI,"While Frank Avruch may indeed have been in the nationally syndicated version, it's worth noting that this version of the show only ran from 1959 to 1970, and was only syndicated nationally from 1965-67. Meanwhile, Chicago's Bob Bell played the character from 1961 to 1984. Add in Joey D'Auria's stint as the character from 1984 to 2001, and you have the longest-running locally produced children's show in history. So, yes, that is worth preserving on DVD.

(Even more ironic is that the company that produced this DVD, Infinity Entertainment, is based out of Illinois! So they should be most familiar with the Chicago version.)

Bell was truly brilliant in the role; he inspired the vocal characterization of Krusty the Clown by Dan Castanella on ""The Simpsons."" As Cooky, Roy Brown was equally brilliant. The team at times recalled the comic chemistry of Laurel and Hardy or Jim Henson and Frank Oz. D'Auria had big shoes to fill (no pun intended), but he and Brown also made an excellent team.

All that being said, the Avruch episodes are not completely without merit. Indeed, all versions of the show should have some representation on DVD. It's the focus solely on this one version that remains the most baffling.

This set has its time and place. The rest of us are still holding out for a great ""Chicago's Bozo"" box set.",1201219200,,1328,4.81140350877193
2807193,3,B000P1KPGI,"'Bozo: The World's Most Famous Clown, Vol. 1' (2007) features 30 full-color episodes of the famous children's program which reached the zenith of its popularity during the 50s and 60s, when 'Bozo' was then both a national treasure and a national franchise. Those episodes included here were culled from the Boston show, which featured Frank Avruch as the title character.

Depending on the viewer's taste and on which Bozo they experienced in childhood, Avruch either makes an excellent Bozo or merely a serviceable one. Immediately noticeable is the fact that Avruch doesn't play the High Clown role in any appreciable sense: he essentially speaks and behaves just as any average male adult would when dealing with fairly small children in public.

This is a failing of the show in several ways, since Avruch is neither particularly poised, charming, nor amusing. He doesn't try to be funny, and isn't. The program's other performers, who hurry on and off the stage with both forced and sincere abandon, are equally awkward and amateurish, even clumsy.

Most of the skits, which are completely without wit, appear to have been creatively drummed up moments before their execution, leaving viewers very likely to feel embarrassed for everyone involved.

The games are rushed and the hazy rules arbitrarily shouted out to the dazed children, who are rushed from their seats and then rushed back to them; giant beachballs go array, bouncing out of camera range or right into the camera. Younger viewers may wonder how and why this program, or the larger Bozo franchise, ever became successful to any degree.

As Bozo, Avruch's clown hair is extremely long, unruly, and curled up around the ends, giving him something of the weird, sinister caste that many adults today attribute to clowns.

However, for those watching this DVD set for nostalgic purposes, none of this will really matter, for the program, seen today, actually gains from having been crudely produced in its era, especially since the material presented here hasn't been remastered.

The array of bright auditorium colors, the meager puppet animals, the crude vintage cartoons, and slightly grotesque makeup and costumes of Bozo's associates fascinate, especially if the viewer watched the show zealously as a small child and hasn't glimpsed it since.

Since most Americans owned only black-and-white television sets during the show's heyday, seeing it in color for the first time will only add to its bizarre glamour.

Equally mesmerizing are the relatively enthusiastic and largely well-behaved children who compose the audience, most of who are Caucasian and decked out in their Sunday finest. Baby boomers will appreciatively recall this era, when middle class little girls always wore dresses and bows in their hair, and little boys appeared at social events wearing ties, buttoned collars, and their hair unpleasantly flattened with Brylcreem.",1191456000,16,2912,5.245161290322581
2807194,5,B000P1KPGI,Ive been waiting for classic childrens TV like this to be rediscovered for years. Lets not kill chances for further releases just because you don't like the host of this set. This is americana at its best. Please release more soon.,1189900800,5,231,4.658536585365853
2807195,1,B000P1KPGI,"As much as I appreciate Larry Harmon for creating the character Bozo the Clown, I cant help but echo what others have said here...for those of us that grew up watching Bob Bell in the role, I would NEVER buy anything else but Bob's Bozo on dvd.  It is my sincere hope that WGN TV would open its archives and that of the Chicago based Museum of Broadcast Communications (MBC) to release all that they can from Bob Bell's Bozo that ran for years and years on Tribune Broadcasting WGN TV.  Between the Bozo Show and its many incarnations and the Ray Rayner & Friends morning show--that was LOCAL kids programming at its best and I think it is sorely missed by me and others.

2807196,3,B000P1KPGI,"Although Bozo was never one of my priority items as a kid - as a historical show it's good to see it coming out.  For those of you who do not understand the economics of the DVD business, feel free to blast it for not being ""your Bozo"".  Once I have a sample for my educational purposes, it makes no difference to me whether other episodes come out or not - but if this one flops, the odds are high you will never get a chance on getting the one(s) you want.  And just in case you missed the point, Bozo was national - Chicago is big, but there are bigger - and have any of you surveyed the potential audience to find out how many would pre-purchase whoever his name is editions?  Smart money says help kill it and you may just kill it - and , by-the-by, you are putting up nothing but complaint - the rule in sales is ""show them the money""",1180742400,,840,4.042168674698795

This is amazing!!!

As for those who prefer Bob Bell or Joey D' Auria, each were great Bozos but Frank Avruch was the syndicated Bozo for the 60s and most of the 70s. He's the Bozo that I grew up with on NY television.

This set features the BEST Bozo of ALL TIME!!! The one that Larry Harmon chose to be the NATIONALLY SYNDICATED show!!!

Sorry CHICAGO...but all the rest of us grew up with Frank Avruch, who was considered (and aparently by releasing this box set...still)the all time best Bozo The Clown, by Mr. Harmon!!!

This show was done in Boston, but syndicated everywhere...I grew up in New York and WE grew up with THIS Bozo The Clown...also, FYI...Bozo's sidekicks, Mr. Lion & Kookie The Kangaroo were done by the one and only Carol Spinney, better known in later years as both Big Bird and Oscar The Grouch on Sesame Street

8188168,4,B000P1KPGI,I really have a question for Amazon. I was born and raised in Chicago when I was in Elementary school. My school took a field trip to Bozo the Clown show. I remember when they selected the girl and boy from the audience. It was with an arrow only person watching TV would be able to see. I was selected at that one show to throw the ball in the bucket for the prizes. I remember I did up to bucket number 2 or 3. I brought home lots of toys and games. I would do anything to be able to see that show. It was like from 1965 to 1970. My mom was sick in bed watching the show. I was born 1960. Must of been like from 1 to 4 grade.

On our first appearance my brother was picked as Butch and my number was picked to go for the treasure chest. Seemed odd to me that we both were chosen but didn't matter. I recall when my number was called out several 'older' kids, after all I think I was 4, were yelling at me to get up and go see Bozo. As soon as I got next to Bozo I panicked and ran off the set. At the end of the show he came up to me and gave some prizes. For several years after I saw myself in my blue shorts and suspenders run off the set many times I didn't see my TV debut on Vol. 1 so I hoping its on Vol. 2. Good quality DVD.
