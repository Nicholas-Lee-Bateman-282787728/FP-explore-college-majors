3890853,1,B002AQ2G3Q,"The BBC is usually known for good work
This is AWFUL
It is unclear auditory wise
It is uncreative animation (borders on ugly) and is bORING
The Spanish learned is not helpful in everyday life
Muzzy himself, the doll and the cartoon character are quite un appealing
I love Spanish, speak it, understand it
and I am sorry someone did not warn me as to how awful it is
BBC usually stands for quality
NOT IN THIS CASE !!!

oh and the instant immersion??? nOT QUITE  you would be immersed in every day
coversations and going about business, work or play...this is off into silly inane directions",1296432000,12,590,4.5046728971962615
8359987,5,B002AQ2G3Q,I love this program.  My child loves it more.  This is a replacement for one that we previously had.  She started listening to Muzzy at 9 months old.  She's almost 2 years old now and she is speaking spanish fluently.,1442361600,4,217,4.35
8359988,5,B002AQ2G3Q,Great fun & great way for children to learn another language.,1436313600,4,61,4.636363636363637
8359989,5,B002AQ2G3Q,"These are excellent.  They teach systematically and review what they  have taught.  There are print materials that help parents who are learning too.  Me and my son both learned an enormous amount from these videos.  They do provide a story that as another reviewer mentioned is a little racy for for some,  but certainly not as threatening as some of the villains in the classic Disney movies.
My son was mainly enthralled with the Muzzy character that ate metal.  They are pricey, so we bought the VHS version since we had an old TV that would play them.  However, I would certainly pay for the DVD's because we have both enjoyed them and learned from them.",1406160000,,659,4.620689655172414
8359990,5,B002AQ2G3Q,"My kids LOVE love love muzzy.  They already know the Spanish alphabet, the numbers, colors...I Would recommend it to anyone wanting their kids to learn or be introduce to another language..",1389916800,8,189,5.096774193548387
8359991,5,B002AQ2G3Q,"My parents got me this program in VHS when i was a child and that's how i learned a lot of the English I know now.
I don't see any problem with it, i think its great. I am planning to get this for my daughter. I loved it, i used to watch it all the time, and i am really excited that this is now on DVD, my daughter saw a preview of one of this videos and she was really interested.",1379548800,5,382,3.6144578313253013
8359992,1,B002AQ2G3Q,"I've seen this program advertised on television and want to immerse my 3 year old daughter in Spanish early - but this is definitely not a good choice.

The first lesson begins with a cartoon in which the teenage daughter of a king (Sylvia) decides to ""run away"" with her lover ""Bob"".  The king's henchman sees them kiss and ride away on a motorcycle and alerts the king.  The king chases his daughter Sylvia and Bob with a helicopter until they crash their motorcycle.  Then Bob is captured by the kings guard and dragged off to prison.  Does this sound like something you want a toddler to watch?  Is this the best story line they could come up with?

In a society which promotes reality TV shows and people like the Kardashians, maybe this storyline sounds tame.  But in my opinion children don't need to be exposed to this type of content to learn Spanish.

I'm sending the series back for a refund today.",1363910400,17,909,4.4939024390243905
8359993,4,B002AQ2G3Q,"We are excited and I can't say the kids love it yet, but we are starting slow and beginning to watch the DVD's with the English subtitles at first.

My oldest daughter wants to learn very quickly but this is something you and your children need to do slowly and the repetition helps. I think the visual and the words go very well together in an immersion program and it is fairly easy to figure out.

We've used the dictionary a lot. The music is kind of distracting but the system works and that is what is important. We have only had it three days and have not used all the dvd's yet but we have level I and II.

I am planning to give the children all the time they need and this is much better than the adult Cd's I have which teach words they may not even use since my Cd's are geared towards the business traveler.",1343174400,,819,4.10625
8359994,5,B002AQ2G3Q,"My 4- and 3-year-olds LOVE Muzzy and have learned a great deal of Spanish from the cartoon. They like the dialog between the characters and ask me questions about the relationships. My children do not watch any television programs (the DVD is watched on a computer in our common room), so they may have a longer attention span toward Muzzy due to the novelty.

Muzzy is not fast paced like most tv programs, so some may find it boring. If your child watches limited amounts of television, and programs geared toward a younger audience, then Muzzy may be suitable for them. After two months, my children are still watching Muzzy, plus they like to listen to the CD of the dialog as they are going to sleep, or riding in the car.

We also purchased Hooked on Spanish (from the makers of Hooked on Phonics), an interactive CD ROM, which has also helped my children.",1318982400,6,862,4.554838709677419
8359995,1,B002AQ2G3Q,"This has to be the worst excuse for a foreign language course I have ever seen. It has the poorest sound quality and the poorest graphics I have ever heard or seen. They must have had the most amazing marketing department on the planet to make this piece so popular. I did have the DVD version not the VHS version but I am sure they are identical. My kids were bored with this in about 5 minutes and learned absolutely nothing. I couldn't even get them to watch it again. So, I put it on ebay. This spanish language course is a total waste of money.",1318032000,5,549,4.188679245283019
8359996,5,B002AQ2G3Q,"We bought Muzzy in French for our then-two year old.  She's heard it in the car dozens and dozens of times but really only watched the video one dozen times :).  Fast forward two years later (now), with the impact Dora and Diego have had on her interest in Spanish, I obtained Spanish Muzzy for her, and she's enjoying it just as immensely, really picking up on the language.

Using a simple story, catchy songs, breaks in the middle to reinforce vocabulary, children really do learn the basics of foreign language.  Muzzy is just amazing...I highly recommend it.",1303257600,16,563,4.714285714285714
