581676,5,6303144659,"This movie is great! I am always on the lookout for a children/s dvd that is good, but is not a full length ""Disney"" feature. When the kids need entertainment, but don't have two hours to kill for instance.  This movie fills the bill perfectly. Fun, different, keeps them entertained  and they can watch it over and over if they do have 2 hours to kill.",1424563200,,353,4.333333333333333

Great movie; and, boy, does the movie look good on blu-ray!",1414713600,3,314,4.491228070175438
581736,4,6303144659,"This is the same cartoon from when I grew up in the 80's, with that 70's music and Chuck Jones Looney Tunes style we all remember and love... sigh. The only thing this nit-picky mother of an almost 4 year old preschooler can negatively say about this is that the word ""stupid"" is said. Of course, my son picked up on it immediately and although we had previously mentioned we didn't like that word being said, how can we tell him not to say it when we let him watch this cartoon? Other than that, I recognize it's a small negative detail in an otherwise wonderful (nostalgic) story, especially the message the Sneetches contains.",1412640000,,629,4.526315789473684
