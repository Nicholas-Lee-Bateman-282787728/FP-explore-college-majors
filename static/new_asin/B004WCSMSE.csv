4486400,1,B004WCSMSE,"We borrowed this DVD from the library (thankfully); terrible, just terrible.  I was hoping for something that would go over, maybe even repeatedly, how to go to the bathroom.  Rather than rant and rave, I'll just give you some highlights:

Pros:
*DVD shows a child's toilet
*Child will be able to say ""arr"" at the end of the video
*Video belongs to the library, not me

Cons:
*Confusing (even for an adult.  Not sure how a child is supposed to understand it)
*Songs use many words well beyond that of it's targeted audience
*One song (long song) in the middle of the movie had absolutely nothing to do with going potty
*Epic fail teaching kiddos how to use the potty
*Even with careful analyzation, an adult would not be able to discern how to us the potty after viewing the movie
*Tax dollars were spent to buy this video for the library

Please don't waste your time with this video.  I will update this when I find potty time video worth viewing :)",1354320000,4,951,4.46242774566474
8444993,5,B004WCSMSE,Thanks for the video; like New! Speedy shipping too! Have a happy thanksgiving!,1511308800,,79,5.153846153846154
8444994,5,B004WCSMSE,This was a shower gift find a pirate theme and my friend just loved it.,1466812800,,71,3.8
8444995,1,B004WCSMSE,"There was nothing in the title or description of this movie that hinted that it was for boys. Once I received it I noticed that it says ""For boys"" along the bottom of the DVD. While I now see that on the tiny thumbnail image I would have expected to see it somewhere in the product information. After watching, there's actually no reason it can't be used for girls yet the songs are all about boys. My daughter likes pirates (and superheroes and dinosaurs for that matter). I wish this DVD had been made unisex but, failing that, at least put ""for boys"" somewhere that doesn't require squinting to read.",1465948800,,603,4.490909090909091
8444996,3,B004WCSMSE,"This is in general, a fair video. My son quite enjoys it. I dislike the poor grammar used throughout. ""I don't need no diapers"" is one song and it also says to ""wash your hands good"". A childrens video should always use correct English.",1412640000,,236,4.386363636363637
8444997,5,B004WCSMSE,Awesome for boys and girls.,1410912000,,27,4.6
8444998,5,B004WCSMSE,Cute video to keep my 3 year old son interested in potty training! Catchy songs that make your boy child want to start the potty traing process.,1404000000,,144,4.37037037037037
8444999,3,B004WCSMSE,cute cartoon but the only thing the boy child could focus on was the pirate. He completely overlooked the potty part.,1392768000,,117,4.619047619047619
8445000,5,B004WCSMSE,This really helped my 2-year-old boy showing real little boys singing about potty time and washing hands. He loved being a good potty pirate.,1379289600,,141,4.916666666666667
8445001,5,B004WCSMSE,"My children LOVE this video and run around singing the theme song. A fun pirate video with catchy songs was a great help in training my children. I originally rented it from the library, but enjoyed it so much I purchased it to use when my younger children are ready. Though the video is just boys by daughter enjoyed it as well.",1369958400,,329,4.32258064516129
8445002,5,B004WCSMSE,"This video is loved by my 17 month old.  I did not think it was that great, but he knows what the potty is now, and asks for me to play this video.  Potty Pirates is geared towards boys.  Rare you find a girl who wants to be a pirate anyway.  He watches it everyday, and has learned about hand washing, and how to go potty.",1356652800,,323,3.8484848484848486
