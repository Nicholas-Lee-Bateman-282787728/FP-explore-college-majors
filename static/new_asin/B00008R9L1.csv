Also, the English subtitles are in a small font and the letters and words closely run together, making it difficult to read.  The frontal male nudity in one scene was unexpected and unusual, a plus, however.",1237334400,,327,4.52542372881356
7986373,2,B00008R9L1,"I noticed this film on every ""great latin film"" list and i was sincerely curious, i bought it and tried to watch it but it was very bad.  painful to watch, I mean it jumped around senselessly, there are no interesting or notable characters, the film quality was very bad and it took me a month to finish this turkey.  i kept asking myself if i missed something, was i not smart enough?  I kept expecting it to make sense or to come together but it never did. How this film landed on anyones list of ""Good"" films is beyond me.  I was expecting the quality of ""City of men"" or ""Carindiru"" or ""Lower City"" or ""Amores Perros"" or ""En la Puta Vida"" which were all very good films but this is in no way like those great movies.  It in fact wasn't even a close second or third. CU is not good, and i mean it...it could only make sense to someone who lives in Brazil and is attracted to bad cinema though i cant imagine how.  by the way, that Guy on the cover is not a main character, he is more of a background extra then anything, i didn't get why he was on the box...this movie is Chronically Unbearable....save your money...please!",1233792000,6,1126,4.213953488372093
7986374,3,B00008R9L1,"Brazilian tourist agencies don't have to sue the creators of ""The Simpsons"" when their own countrymates have enough ammunition for criticizing that nation.  This movie is obviously a satire, both enlightening and heavy-handed, just like ""Bamboozled,"" ""A Day without a Mexican,"" or any of Michael Moore's films.  The point of the film is to decry the treatment of the indigenous, the blacks, the poor, and the environment in Brazil.  It focuses on numerous areas of the nation to show that the whole society is going you-know-where in a hand basket.  As progressive as this might be, there are two main characters, both white men, who seem like they would be disaffected in any society.  This film is very much Sartre goes south of the Equator.  The two main characters just express their ennui; they never discuss their race, and possibly class-based, privilege.  Besides the potentially progressive lament, this film does ask, ""Can Brazil have a national identity when its people are so divided by class, race, and immigration status?""  Furthermore, like the French ""The Closet,"" this film tries its on stab at attacking political correctness.  I'm not sure who was the audience: Brazilians or non-Brazilians.  Regardless, I highly doubt this would make Brazilians change their nation's wrongs and it certainly wouldn't make non-Brazilians want to visit.  The title expresses the ennui and lethargy in a quick phrase.  Anyone who is expecting a modern-day ""Black Orpheus"" from this film will be greatly disappointed, but possibly made aware.",1107561600,10,1542,5.223577235772358
7986375,5,B00008R9L1,"A wonderfully thought-provoking glimpse into the darker side of Brazilian society.  I really loved this non-linear narrative that reveals the complexity, passion and desperation of a country forever on the edge.  I found myself thinking about it and recommending it to friends long after seeing it.  My only complaint is that it sometimes felt a little didactic.  Highly recommended!",1089676800,12,383,5.440677966101695
