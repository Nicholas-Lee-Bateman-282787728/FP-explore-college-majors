8474376,4,B005IA9JTA,"I like Buffalo Bill Jr.
He looks good, not too handsome, stands tall, wears chaps and pretty much does his own riding, fighting and stunting. In super-cheapie productions like these you really had to be the whole show. His line delivery is awful. He often flubs his lines, but cutting him some slack, so do many of the others in this one-take-only double bill. Still, Jay Wilsey, aka Buffalo Bill Jr., has a habit of reading his lines off cue sheets just off the side of camera range. And still yet, he manages that same quiet, shy charm that made Ken Maynard so enduring to his fans.

To put it bluntly, these two movies are pretty bad. They're poorly acted, directed and photographed. And the ALPHA prints are choppy/splicy early on for both features, but settle in and become stable for most of the running times. Both features are very watchable and maintain a sort of home movie quality that adds much to their charm and likeability.

I will not go into plot details for either PUEBLO TERROR or WHIRLWIND RIDER, other than Yak Canutt is the lead heavy in one and the equally great George Chesebro is the main villain in the other. If you watch these things, it's not for the plot anyway. All you need to know is that these are two (many considered lost) examples of LOW-budget B-Western film making during that early 1930's sound period, before background music, before singing cowboys. These are cowboy movies of some historical importance. They're fun to watch and are a kind of time trip back to the 1930's. No expensive town sets were built here. They filmed around what was standing and made it fit in.

Great stuff, love it.",1330646400,2,1635,4.6116838487972505
