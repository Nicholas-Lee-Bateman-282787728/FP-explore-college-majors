4075631,1,B0036BDQLA,I should preface this by saying I don't own this and I will not buy this because I have seen the screenshots at DVDBeaver and they are terrible. What is going on over at Dragon Dynasty?  This is really shoddy work - just pure laziness.  I was so excited for this.  I am a huge fan of the Hong Kong Legends Region 2 DVD which is long out of print and I have even seen the film on the big screen at a reperatory theater (The New Beverly in Los Angeles) and was really looking forward to seeing this.  It seems Dragon Dynasty is cutting corners.  One other instance is their Supercop release without the original Hong Kong cut.  I don't know... it seems like the Weinstein company doesnt actually care about these films and just wants to release them in the cheapest way possible.  I bet this is one of the reasons Bey Logan isn't really with the company anymore.,1269820800,9,860,4.304347826086956
4075632,1,B0036BDQLA,"Just awful.  No remastered picture.  It's from a 1080i interlaced PAL transfer with no HD audio and no new extras.  Looks like the Weinstein's have managed to ruin yet another film on Blu-ray by being extremely cheap.

Definitely input your thoughts on their Dragon Dynasty site here:
[...]

I guess if you haven't seen it and you really want to since there are no other available US releases available, do so at your own risk.  Try renting it first before buying and rate it against other Blu-ray releases from the same time period as the Killer.",1269648000,22,547,4.645833333333333
4075633,1,B0036BDQLA,"I am about to cancel my pre-order of this Blu Ray release.  Please check the screen grabs at DVDBeaver.  The transfer is obviously INFERIOR to prior DVD releases.  I was eagerly awaiting this title, but I am not going to throw away $20.  This is a disgrace.",1269388800,81,257,4.404255319148936
4075634,1,B0036BDQLA,"As any fan of this film knows, we've been waiting for the clichd 'Holy Grail' for a long time. Every release on DVD has been plagued by horrible prints, remixed audio, cropped image, bad subtitle tracks, non anamorphic image and various sundry image issues. All of those problems have left nearly every DVD edition as coasters on your coffee table as they were painful to watch. No release, save the TF1 French DVD release (without English subtitles) has ever done John Woo's The Killer justice.

Here comes Dragon Dynasty, the unholy offspring of the Weinstein's buy up of distribution rights in the United States of nearly every Asian film. Well known for their Blu-Rays which are merely DVD upconverts (Hard Boiled on the PS3 game Stranglehold) or otherwise botched jobs like the burned out picture on Jackie Chan's Police Story, the butchered version of Supercop, interlacing instead of progressive on The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin etc.

After reading the Blu-Ray review on DVD Beaver and viewing the disc myself via a broken street release, it is easy to see that this disc is another Dragon Dynasty abomination. The disc is 1080i and suffers from visual artifacts that accompany a PAL source. The audio is NOT lossless and is instead compressed Dolby Digital 2.0 Cantonese and 5.1 English dub. The only redeeming feature is that coherent subtitle translation that seems to be sourced from a prior release in the United Kingdom. The extras are also sourced from elsewhere and are presented in Mandarin dub and are of dramatically lower visual quality.

Despite Dragon Dynasty's insistence this was a ""Full HD"" presentation and their boasting of its greatness on Twitter, it is nothing of the sort. It's another hackneyed release from the team at DD. While it may be ""the best"" when it comes to The Killer on home media, it is far from being worthy even as replacement for a VHS copy. While it may improve audio and visual wise on prior releases, it's like going from a Yugo car to a Fiat. Buying this Blu-Ray supports their lazy and disgraceful approach to these classic films.",1269302400,243,2080,4.853521126760564
4075635,1,B0036BDQLA,"Just to counterbalance the hyperbolic 5 star ""review""s which have absolutely no relevance to this Blu-ray Dragon Dynasty abomination:

From DVDBeaver:

From [...]:
""..wow, what a major disppointment...This is so far from high definition quality that aside from being anamorphically enhanced I can't really say much else recommends it...at times not even as sharp as a decently upconverted SD-DVD...Vivendi really needs to go back to the drawing board on these Dragon Dynasty releases, because the first two have been travesties from an image standpoint..""

4075685,5,B0036BDQLA,"This is not the review for the DRAGON DYNASTY released bluray.
It is for the FORTUNE STAR bluray release 7.1 TRUE HD AUDIO NEWLY HD Remastered release in Korea.
I bought the DRAGON DYNASTY released bluray and was so mad that I threw it away right away because I had a better DVD version with the nicely DTS audio and pretty good VIDEO track.

But this one, man, you should see this one.
The Audio is not as good as I expected but the video is so far there cannot be a better one in another 50 years.
The Video was concentrated in showing as if it was shot in digital.
The image is as close as HD not film.
It was transferred beautifully.

As you all know the film itself is a masterpiece and I have seen it a thousand times.

There is a man who is a cop who meets this killer and falls in love with him. The cop is not a homo sexual but he just fell in love so deeply.
He won't do the same with any other man in his whole life again but just with this man.
He even tries to save the killer's girl just because of him. He has no interest in the killer's girl but just him.

The killer. During complete the mission, he accidentally made this singer blind.
You see this killer is a romantist and he couldn't just let the singer woman alone.
He has to take care of her. He always stays close to her.
One day he finally comes close to her to save her from a bunch of mobs who try to steal monet and rape her.
From then on the whole world means just for this woman to him.

The cop, he comes closer to this killer.
Even before seeing him with his own eyes, he already becomes one with the killer. He even imitates his killing moment as if he was there.
He was the killer already. He was not the cop anymore.

When two finally meet on the woman's apartment, there were as if there is a spark. a big shinning spark so bright that we can see if from miles.
From then on two become one. They fight together, they become worriors and fight in this huge war.
Their neck doesn't matter anymore.
When one is fighting with his gun the other was so happy seeing him because now they are one.
When finally the killer died, the cop has no more meaning to live anymore.
He has to just do the revenge. So he get rid of the name tag and finishes the guy who killed the killer.

Before the killer died, he lost his eyes just like he stole from the singer. His punishment fulfiller from god.

4075691,4,B0036BDQLA,"The Killer is an action staple, not only in Hong Kong cinema but in world cinema. While it is certainly one of the greatest Asian action movies ever made, there are things about it that haven't necessarily aged so well. However, part of this nostalgia is what we love about the movie.

Chow Yun-Fat plays another one of his iconic John Woo characters, this time with the occasional harmonica ala Charles Bronson's character (The Man With The Harmonica) in Once Upon a Time in the West. If John Woo did not actually invent ""gun-fu"", he certainly popularized it. Woo was the master of the slow motion gunfighting scenes, in between Mexican standoffs, all primed for a big payoff.

At this point Yun-Fat is reaching the height of his coolness, when you pair that with the suave late 80's Hong Kong fashion, an electric piano score and Woo's obvious love for American cinema you get a great stylization of cops and robbers.

While there is no doubt scenes in the movie that will be considered ""cheesy"" by some, there is no denying it's iconic action scenes.
As most others have noted in the Amazon reviews for this movie, the transfer is pretty lousy. Unfortunately your best bet to watch this movie as intended will be to catch a 35mm projection of it at your local revival cinema until a better version is released.",1432684800,4,1313,4.650862068965517

4075727,4,B0036BDQLA,"It's complicated, my relationship to this movie. John Woo started out doing comedies, I understand from someone who met him one time. So John Woo has an impeccable sense of timing. The first time I saw ""The Killer,"" I loved it. Here are my notes:

This is great filmmaking. John Woo was on his game here. Great atmosphere, great acting, great photography, beautiful visually. One of the best action movies of all time, I'd say. I have only one real complaint. (SPOILER ALERT) At the end, I would not have had the killer lower his gun. Just shoot the guy in the head. But I see what they were going for, sympathy for the killer. Oh, well. Still, a classic.

So I bought ""The Killer"" from Amazon. When I started to watch it the second time, I had forgotten about the lovely woman, the singer who is blinded accidentally by the killer, played by Chow Yun-Fat, one of my favorite actors.

I lost my sense of aesthetic distance and felt so sorry for the singer that I couldn't watch it. Go figure. I still recommend the movie. It's beautifully filmed and has a better story line than a lot of Hong Kong action movies. My favorite movie by John Woo.",1412380800,,1143,4.433333333333334

4075734,3,B0036BDQLA,"First off, I am reviewing the Movie itself, not the DD Blu-Ray conversion, which is pretty poor.

It had been a pretty long time since I had seen this. Revisiting more recent Woo/Fat films such as Replacement Killers and older staples like Hard Boiled made me want to watch what I had considered the tandem's best, Killer.

Upon watching it, I was immedately struck by how poorly the film has aged, both Cinementography, musical score, soundtrack, casting and script.. The pacing holds up well, but it fallen way behind Hardboiled and Replacement Killers IMHO.

For the Woo completionist, this is a must buy, just don't expect this movie to be the showcase movie to ""Woo"" those that have not seen a pure Woo/Fat flick. I now give that distinction to Hard Boiled, the intro to Replacement Killers, or maybe Better Tommorow",1382140800,,821,4.808510638297872

4075737,4,B0036BDQLA,"Let me preface this by saying that this film is definitely not appropriate for younger viewers.  It is an unending, unremitting, endless series of bloody exchanges of gunfire between thugs and police, thugs and other thugs, a massive, bloody shooting rampage with bodies flying everywhere on a scale not remotely equaled by anything Hollywood has ever produced.  It even contains a woman and child being wounded in crossfires.  And the violence seems more shockingly realistic than most gun violence in Hollywood films, which makes it even more horrifying.  You can almost feel the bullets penetrate your psyche.  It is ten thousand times bloodier and more violent than even the most violent scenes of a movie like, say, ""The Wild Bunch.""  There is a sort of corny code of honor between a cop and an assassin that develops, but all of this is mere pretext to carry on with the violent show. If you are faint of heart or abhor violence, you'll want to stay far away from this.  Yes, definitely not for the faint of heart.",1368576000,2,1020,4.761363636363637

This is the same as Anchor Bay did with ""A Better Tomorrow"" as all their foreign films are released in the English language edition but without the onslaught of criticism that ""The Killer"" has. Of course Criterion is a perfect Chinese language release so the negative reviews are there. I would rather have the films as they were originally released as some shots specifically of the titles appear out of proper aspect ratio because the English titles are edited in instead of the Chinese Titles. This is a minor gripe however because for the most part this is a nice looking film and I suppose many people purchasing a US dvd expect it to be in English.

4075753,1,B0036BDQLA,"I just picked up one of the DD DVD versions from Amazon and yeah, it's going right back out for sale -- it's as bad as many others have said. I couldn't get through the first couple of minutes! Skipped around to check, but yeah, the whole thing is littered with bootleg-esque and/or PAL-like conversion artifacts over *every moving image*...insanely bad for a professionally produced release such as this. Normally I'm not picky when it comes to Hong Kong films as I know that they have a reputation for not taking care of their own archives (and indeed I've leaned more toward DD DVDs rather than their Blus, based on overall buyer recommendations). But DD has been doing a pretty good job on much older films such as 'Come Drink with Me' -- what's the deal, dudes? (I know it's not all your fault, Bey!) This release is pitiful, and for one of my favorite films, I'll happily stick with my Winstar DVD for a more 'authentic' presentation, including more accurate cultural opening. The resolution of the soundtrack is actually improved, it's deeper, fuller sounding even only in 2.0 (as it was originally produced and intended), but it's still not worth it to sit through the awful DVD imaging.

As far as the bonus material, the interview with John Woo cuts out of sound during the opening moments, again strange and hard to believe, plus he's basically repeating things fans all know from various other interviews on other releases surrounding this film (why not try to include the great doc/interview from the French release?). The American Cinematheque interviews are hard to decipher due to their local audio (and again has Woo saying things that for the most part fans have all heard before), and the only rather amusing and interesting featurette is the short following up on locations utilized in the film.

I also own the OOP Fox-Lorber/Winstar DVD which looks like a murky, second generation VHS by comparison. It is also non-anamorphic, unlike the Blu Ray. The subtitles on the Blu Ray are also far superior to the DVD - some of the dialogue is downright poetic, whereas the DVD dialogue was often corny. I definitely recommend this release for fans of this movie and classic action cinema in general, especially at such a low price. I haven't seen the OOP Criterion edition but I can't imagine it's superior enough to warrant the asking price for old copies. Go with this one.

4075757,3,B0036BDQLA,"I will not comment on the movie as anyone knows it is one of those classics that we have come to expect from john Woo, along with Hard Boiled and a Better tomorrow I and II.

To be honest this is a really really poor transfer as relates to Blu-Ray, from the awful sound at the opening credits, to the moments of sound loss during the movie. flicking around my settings I managed to get a half decent sound as opposed to the modern Blu-rays which ""auto"" switch to DTS.

My recommendation is if you already have it on reg DVD to not bother buying the Blu-ray as there are no real improvements if you have it on VHS then an upgrade is probably wise if only to have the ability to slow mo your favorite parts and scene select.",1314921600,5,722,4.15
4075758,2,B0036BDQLA,"John Woo's ""The Killer"" is among my top three favorite John Woo films.  The other two being ""Bullet in the Head"" and ""Hard-Boiled"".  Although not as unique as his HK work I did enjoy ""Face/Off"" and ""Hard Target"", regarding his American work.  ""Red Cliff"" is his best movie in years, an instant classic (another review).

I once owned the Criterion Laser Disc of ""The Killer"". At the time they had a decent print and transfer, however; scratches, dirt and grain were present.  I have also owned the Fox/Lorber VHS and currently own the Fox/Lorber DVD, released in 2000.

Which brings us to the current Dragon Dynasty release.  I read the reviews here on Amazon before I made the purchase, so it wasn't like I wasn't fairly warned.  Why didn't I listen?  At the very least the extra disk has a few nice little clips; featuring locations the film was shot, and Q/A's with John Woo pertaining to ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled"".

The problem with Dragon Dynasty's release seems to be the video transfer/source.  I'm just a layman when it comes to technical knowledge, however; from what I can gather from research, Dragon Dynasty used a PAL source in lieu of a NTSC source.  When the frame is still the picture looks fine to me (I've read some reviews that complain over color saturation and lack of sharpness), when there's movement on screen however; things get really weird.  Being a John Woo film there tends to be a lot of flying bodies, car chases, and explosions.  The problem is when there's movement on screen (even just the turn of a character's head), there's these odd digital distortions/pixelation covering the surface of whatever it is that's moving.  It is extreamly distracting.  Distracting enough to really bug one out.  I watched it straight through to justify my purchase.  I just can't believe that someone at Dragon Dynasty didn't notice this.  Either that, or they really just didn't care.

If you have never seen this film, perhaps none of this matters to you.  On the other hand if you have seen previous releases of this film take heed.  Watching this release compelled me to order the Fortune Star release of ""The Killer"" from Hong Kong.  It's re-mastered, in NTSC and region free.  I suggest you do the same.",1314057600,10,2232,4.752604166666667
4075759,4,B0036BDQLA,"John Woo certainly got Hollywood's attention with this bloody crime thriller from Hong Kong. Chow Yun-Fat plays Ah Jong (Jeffery), an assassin for hire. His boss Fung Sei (Sidney) double crosses him on what he says is his last assignment. Now the gang wants Jeffery dead. Another key element is a police detective well played by Danny Lee who is after all of them. While there is no question that the film earns its reputation for the massive amount of gun fights, blood splattering and flying bullets, there are a couple relationship stories in play as well. The least of which is between Jeffery and a young singer he accidentally blinds in a shoot out. She is played by Sally Yeh and doesn't do much but scream throughout the movie. She is just plain annoying. The other(s) are between Jeffery and his boss who eventually reconcile. Also there is a developing appreciation of each other between Jeffery and Inspector Li Ying (Lee). The stunts are well choreographed by Woo, but some of the stunt men overdo it. They look more like an NBA player executing a flop. There's also the final battle when dozens of henchmen show up at a church to kill our heroes. They just seem to gather together in groups of 8 and come through the front door every 5 minutes or so, allowing them to be gunned down by the good/bad guys.

Characters are excellent, action is just right - well balanced, sub plots are sharp and the Ying and Yang target is hit dead center. His birds (a Woo signature)are nicely used.

4075771,4,B0036BDQLA,"At first, I felt the same way a lot of reviewers here... pretty let down.

But the thing is, I have at least 3 different versions of THE KILLER on dvd, with the best overall print coming from the HK LEGENDS dvd in the UK.  After doing a side-by-side on my Toshiba 65"" HDTV, I can honestly say that the Dragon Dynasty blu-ray is still the best version of THE KILLER out there.

Overall, at the least, there are no jagged edges to diagonal lines (which are still present in the HK LEGENDS dvd), but there are quite a few scenes (specifically daytime scenes) which are truly blu-ray quality, with very good detail (one area to look for to spot increased detail is the weave on clothing).

While not perfect, I think this is overall a good to very good release, considering that the original film stock of THE KILLER may not be in the best shape (as the HK film companies are notorious in their handling of storing past films) and it is an improvement on the dvd releases.  Like a lot of reviewers, the sight and sound won't knock you out, but it is definitely worth the $10 it is selling for right now.

Similarly, THE LEGEND and TAI CHI MASTER are definite upgrades over the dvds, per the example above (looking at clothing weave and texture to see if there is any true enhancement or increase in image quality).

4075773,5,B0036BDQLA,"The Blu-Ray of The Killer is certainly not perfect.  I would say the best description is if you watched any modern DVD on an upscaled DVD Player/Blu-Ray Player is about the quality it provides.  It certainly does not feel like you're watching a blu-ray, and I'm sure that someone out there can produce a better picture.  That being said, my old dvd was not anamorphic, and the quality made it look like an bootleg (even though it was not).  It was so dirty and grainy that most people thought it was an old VHS put on dvd.  So, for me, this blu-ray is a nice upgrade (especially given the recent price drop).  However, those who have better editions of the movie (I've heard the criterion version looks quite nice), may want to hold off until another version of the movie comes out.

As to the movie, a pure action classic.  Chow Yun Fat has never been better, a hitman with a regretful soul, who would rather escape his killing ways, but cannot do so without more bloodshed.  The action holds up even today, and the overall story is very enjoyable.  I have watched this movie many times in my life, and must say it's one of my favorites.

4075783,5,B0036BDQLA,"As one might have already gathered many complaints regarding the video and audio transfers of this particular release, please, oh reader, do not be completely disuaded from the actual film altogether. Though if the visual/audio is a significant aspect of your purchase, seek one of the other releases of this film; and by all means seek! And to the tech wizards who have layed out all of the wrongs of this release, please keep in mind there is a large demographic of moviegoers that have never watched nor heard of ""The Killer"". Or John Woo. So this release, I feel, is a gracious gesture by Dragon Dynasty (although a sloppy one, I admit) to give us back a film that was almost impossible to find on retailer's/renter's shelves.

If you want to look over the technical specifications of the dvd/blu-ray, and are new to this title, read on:

John Woo is a benchmark for action cinema. Personally, this faithful reviewer cannot think of any other action filmmaker (outside of kung-fu cinema) that articulates violence, blood-soaked to the absolute threads violence, better than Mr. John Woo. I remember the first time I watched ""Hard Boiled"". It was around the same time the video game Max Payne debuted for PC and the original ""Matrix"" film was showing off American viewers what, we in the states, have been missing all these years in action: sheer, for the hell of it, style! Moments in films where one can help but to smile and utter under his/her breath, ""cool"". John Woo has these moments in spades.

To this day I cannot find a better representation for the action genre than John Woo's efforts from Hong Kong in the mid-eighties to the early nineties.

""The Killer"" can be debated as John Woo's finest and most elegant moment in filmmaking. Woo, in ""The Killer"", weaves a poetic story that sews equal parts rich characters (as far as actioners go) and magnificent interludes of romantic gun-play, not seen in Hong Kong actioners today outside Johnny To's camera lenses. Unfolding like a well-developed Leone Western, ""The Killer"" adds more definition to a ""Byronic Hero"", personified by Woo's original cowboy: Chow Yun Fat. ""The Killer"" is unique amongst Woo's movies because of its hero's motivator and/or companionship. Woo is no stranger to brotherly love, detailed the best in ""A Bullet in the Head"". If anybody can provide examples of how strong the bond between friends can really be, Woo can. ""The Killer"" takes a different approach and focuses upon a developing romance involving proctector and protected. When Fat's character accidentally blinds a young woman during a routine hit, his character is forced to second guess his business ethic. Business ethics that are not commonly shared by fellow businessmen, and certainly not his employers. The bond between once-assailant and victim becomes the underlying focus for Woo's favorite theme of human connections and it's reaction when tested, especially threatened.

I won't waste time summarizing ""The Killer"" and its plot, because we all know a John Woo film is not sought after for plot. If you like further depth in your Hong Kong actioners, look for Johnnie To instead. In fact, John Woo does a great job at displaying depth in characters that are written two-dimensionally. This is apparent in most, if not all, of his films. However, this detail, by the ending credits of any of his films, will not be regarded to your average movie-goer. Woo has a distinct flare, like none other, for capturing romance on screen, or extracting intamancy in scenes that one would not conceive to be intimate at all. Every one of his action scenes sings; it dances with violence and bloodshed. Woo's action is furthermore ironic, because of its glorification on the matter of violence (cue doves). Beauty bleeds in a Woo picture and the viewer, clenching their fists with anticipation, will urge the violence to prolong, even for just a few more moments. But the genius of John Woo lies in this simple fact: he is one of the few directors that can bring a visual sensitivity to a genre that is mainly characterized by being just the opposite. A perfect example of this is the ending of this same movie.

So reader, if you are new to the Woo, then take caution: once viewing ""The Killer"", or any of Woo's movies from Hong Kong, you will have reached the pinnacle of the action genre. Boldly stated, maybe, but I stay true to the claim that John Woo's Hong Kong actioners are the best the whole damn action genre has to offer. After watching Woo's contributions it's all down hill. I am still trying to find a film that can outdo Woo's Hong Kong masterpieces, unsuccessfully I might add.

Hell, I'll even take recommendations.

So in short, if you're the type of moviegoer that prefers style to substance (in the action genre, of course) than don't waste anymore time, and add ""The Killer"" to your collection. And while you're at it, check out Woo's roots of the bullet opera with ""A Better Tomorrow"" parts one and two, and of course the Holy Grail of actioners: ""Hard Boiled"".

It's hard to digress when commenting on the subject, so I'll conclude with: John Ol' Boy, stay overseas, get ""Red Cliff"" out your system, and give us another one of these two-fisted forty-five serenades, because the action genre needs 'em.",1270339200,9,5271,4.834811529933481
4075784,3,B0036BDQLA,"Summary:

I give this movie 7 stars out of 5. I give this release 2 stars out of 5.

A magnificent and one of the most influential action/drama movies ever made.

This release, the only one for the North American market, is lack-luster. Cleaned up from original film holes, dirt and dust, sound track noise but offset substantially by the quality of the digital video and audio encoding and compression. The original Cantonese track is mono (expected) but the English dub track is mono too (very unexpected). Subtitles are better than some other releases of this movie. Extra features OK, but not in keeping with a movie of this significance in Asian cinema and action cinema.

This post has some very detailed comments on this movie as a movie, followed by objective facts about the DVD followed by some opinions.

This is one of the most important and influential police thriller, action drama movies ever made and certainly to have ever come from Hong Kong. It is a magnificent stylized gun-fu bullet ballet expanding on themes and character types from previous John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat works such as A better Tomorrow and A Better Tomorrow 2. It is loosely a remake of Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le Samoura"" starring Alain Delon and the chanbara film ""Gyangu 9"" starring Ken Takakura.

Alain Delon and French police thrillers had such an influence on John Woo that we see Chow Yun-Fat, in the role that made him a star in ""A Better Tomorrow"", wearing Alain Delon designer sunglasses with the dark duster/raincoat. Although Chow Yun-Fats characters later wore the now classic Ray Bay Wayfarers, this matchstick chewing, cigarette smoking, designer sunglass wearing duster/raincoat clad image became iconic with Chow Yun-Fat's characters in A Better Tomorrow and subsequent John Woo movies.

For John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat, the dove imagery, the stylized gun-fu bullet ballet and the iconic presentation of the Chow Yun-Fat character all reach their pinnacle in this movie, The Killer. This is the one that defined it all for many, many movies to follow.

For many in western cultures, the gun-play, heroic bloodshed and the intense action scenes are an overwhelming distraction from the more important dramatic content. They are often confused as the central purpose of the movie like so many action genre movies from Hollywood that are devoid of any substance in character development or dramatic content.

In John Woo Hong Kong films, the gun-play, heroic bloodshed and intense action are stylized supporting elements only. The serve to support the emotional intensity and importance that the themes in the dramatic content are to the central characters. It is through the test of intense mortal conflict that the central characters palpably demonstrate their commitment to their mores and beliefs. Because of the history of Chinese, especially Hong Kong, cinema with intense sword-play, heroic bloodshed and similar elements going back to its roots in Chinese Opera, these elements are less distracting and better understood by Hong Kong and Chinese audiences.

As with earlier John Woo films with Chow-Yun Fat, dramatic themes include the conflicts between honor and duty, the conflicting mores between incumbent and incoming generations and power brokers, the discovery of where one's honor and duty truly lie and the redemption through self-sacrifice, including one's own death, for one's true honor and duty.

For The Killer, many may see these iconic character types, themes and actions as clichd. However, it is important to remember that A Better Tomorrow, A Better Tomorrow 2 and, especially The Killer, created these iconic character types themes and actions that, through imitation and homage elsewhere since, have perhaps reached the level of clich. This kind of continuous imitation and homage demonstrate the real significance of this movie.

3) There appear significant numbers of single frames that are highly pixelated and visible on a 20in display.

4) There appear significant single frames that comprise at least two cinema frames overlaid and are visible on a 20in display.

5) There is a little or no shadow and dark/black object detail.

6) There are significant visible quantization/anti-aliasing artifacts, especially in face close-ups, smoke/haze and strongly backlit scenes and are visible on a 20in display.

7) The holes, dust and dirt from the original film source commonly seen in other releases are removed.

8) There are audio distortions, especially with sibilant ""esses"", especially from Sally Yeh.

9) The crackles and pops in the audio track sometimes heard in other releases and clips are removed.

10) It lacks a ""crispness"".

Here are my opinions:
1) For as an important movie as this in Hong Kong and action/drama cinema history and as important as it is to Asian cinema fans, this release is lack-luster.

2) Although nicely cleaned up from holes and dirt, increased contrast, some increased saturation and audio track clean-up, these improvements are substantially offset by the artifacts and loss of shadow/dark detail and some crispness. I find the artifacts and detail loss VERY annoying in places and I'm a farily forgiving viewer. The video encoding details are all the explanation needed as to why all these problems exist in this release.

3) All audio is monaural, AC3 2.0 Dolby and there is no 5.1 or stereo option of any kind. This is deplorable. It is appropriate to offer original mono tracks so that critical viewers can experience the the original exhibition sound and, especially, the original looped voices. However, it is much more enjoyable to many to have at least a stereo processed sound and preferrably a 5.1 processed sound, well done, for general viewing. These are not difficult to produce and have appeared in a huge number of near vintage movies such as this one.

4) It would be pure conjecture to state that the artifacts and absence of more substantial audio tracks are the result of doing whatever was necessary to put this release on DVD5 instead of DVD9 media. It could well be that a decision was made to do this release as cheaply as possible and the video and audio processing done resulted in it all fitting on DVD5. Either way, it certainly does not do this movie justice nor does it endear Dragon Dynasty to its customer base. DVD9 media is ubiquitous in DVDs today. It's capacity allows far better treatment. Greater detail and far fewer artifacts that have been accomplished with much more challenging film sources than this one.

5) The extras are lack-luster. None of them are bad. The ones from John Woo are nice. The absence of other significant film critics and commentaries on the extras disc, and the total absence of a very knowledgeable commentary on the main movie disc is highly disappointing. It was nice to have a short one about the cinema shoot locations not mentioned on the box. For a movie of this importance, absent from the US market for so long, at least a substantial commentary track from an expert such as Bey Logan should have been done. The trailers were a reasonable selection of John Woo movies, but the selection seemed a little opportunisitic. It was nice to see a trailer for A Better Tomorrow. A good release of that one by Dragon Dynasty would be outstanding.

6) For me, I'm ambivalent that I acquired this particular release. I'm seriously disappointed with its quality. If A Better Tomorrow were released with this quality, I would be very ambivalent towards it too. I'm sure it would not be very well received by North American Asian cinema customer base.

7) This release was a golden opportunity for Dragon Dynasty to hit a solid game-winning grand-slam home run. It could have created a brand customer base that would have returned for a lot more releases. Instead, we got, at best, a disappointing attempted single that was thrown out out at 1st. I'll be watching for a much better release from some company in the future.

8) Dragon Dynasty: this is an opportunity to re-think the Asian cinema market and customer base in the US. Outstanding movies presented and treated well, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero, House Of Flying Daggers, and other action movies sell well. Some win Academy awards. There is always an opportunity to re-release this in the near future with a lot better treatment and better extras. Taking it sometime might be well advised. Whoever releases this with stellar treatment and extras will do very well. It's fans are still waiting.",1270252800,19,9461,5.074050225370251
4075785,1,B0036BDQLA,"I loved this film, and waited for its blu-ray release.  But this is worse than my least expectations.  The format is awful. Aspect ratio awful, because the camera zooms in and cuts out top, bottom, and sides of the original film.  How could this happen?  Did they assign a couple of kids in a garage to produce this?  Awful, truly bad.",1270166400,9,335,4.426229508196721
4075786,3,B0036BDQLA,"There is plenty of negativity on Blu Ray review sites regarding this transfer...from the 1080i resolution to the claim that ""older dvd version's look better than the blu ray."" Well let me start out by saying that the 3 stars is for the blu ray itself, not for the movie. The movie is easily a five star film, so let's get to the transfer itself....

Could this have looked better? Absolutely. Am I still more than satisfied with this release until something better comes along? Yes. The 1080i resolution did not bother me in the slightest, it's still high definition and the only time you will notice the interlacing is if you pause during a quick-action scene. Once paused, the interlaced ""combing"" effect becomes apparent. My problem with the transfer is the quality of the print used, which is clearly the fault of Dragon Dynasty for not searching out a better quality print without all of the specks, pops, burns, and scratches. But this is Dragon Dynasty we're talking about, and they're not exactly known for their ""Criterion-level"" quality of work they put into their releases.

Besides the prominent print-issues, the definition of the image looks better than I have ever seen it for this film. Even without the progressive resolution, we still retain an incredible amount of detail.

Special features are somewhat lacking, but decent enough for a Dragon Dynasty release, and are mostly imported from previous versions (honestly, what special edition catalog blu ray's don't have imported special features).

Audio definitely leaves more to be desired, as the entire soundtrack seems very ""canned"" on my Yamaha 5.1 system. It certainly say's something that watching ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" immediately after this, gave my system more of a ""workout"" than ""The Killer"".

In closing, I for one am just happy to finally have a copy of this movie on home video of any sort, as I refused to pay the ridiculous prices for the OUT OF PRINT Criterion version in the past few years. Perhaps someday Criterion or Studiocanal will grab up the rights for this one and we can get a proper 1080P version with some new special features, a 7.1 remastered soundtrack, and a quality print run through a spirit datacine processor. Until then, this transfer/release is more than enough to sit back and enjoy John Woo's classic at home.",1270080000,10,2327,4.881012658227848
4075787,4,B0036BDQLA,"I'm not really sure what people were expecting. This 1080i release (as opposed to 1080p) is the best print of The Killer, as far I'm concerned. It looks nice on both my 32"" HD and my 20"" HD that I have in my room. The picture is far better than the previous Red Sun edition (which was probably bootleg, but didn't look terrible on DVD) that I had.

Look, if the Criterion DVD or any other copy of the film ""looks"" better to you and you don't own either version, more power to you. Basically, if you have an extra 100 bucks or so, go for it. But, for those on a budget that want an upgrade over an older DVD they have, the Bluray is an excellent choice.

The Killer is John Woo's best film, as far as I'm concerned. I loved both Better Tomorrow films, and Hard Boiled is just a great display for both Woo and Chow's talents. But, The Killer has a much better story, I felt. It's a feast of action film making, but also has a great emotional element as well.

The special features are nothing to write home about here. Just enjoy a classic action film and keep praying that Woo returns to Hollywood and gets it right with another classic action film.

Overall, I give it 4/5 stars. It's a great film, and this transfer is an upgrade picture wise as far as I'm concerned. Now, let some fans of the film argue it out and overpay for DVDs. It's also worth noting that there are a lot of bootleg copies out there. If you want to pay extra, do your research first and don't get yourself ripped off. It happened to me, but luckily I only paid $18.

You can save yourself a lot of headaches and time and get a genuine article for a fraction of the ""better"" DVD transfers. Recommended.",1269993600,7,1675,4.205607476635514
4075788,3,B0036BDQLA,"Lets make this clear.  This is the best looking version of the Killer I have ever seen.  Way better than anything released on DVD.  If you are a fan of the movie I recommend getting this release.

My favorite extra was the deleted scenes.  I had never seen these and they were a real treat.  Most are short but there was one longer one where Danny Lee takes Jenny home instead of Chow Yun Fat.  The other extras were ok, but nothing special.

That being said, I do have some problems with the release.  For a more technical analysis of the film visit dvdbeaver and check their review.  Here are some items I noticed.

The subtitles are lousy.  They are technically correct, with very few typos and translation errors.  However, during some key scenes the words are changed up and I my opinion they lose a lot of the emotional impact.  One in particular was the scene where Fung Sei goes to get the money and gets beat up.  The movie also makes mention of triads frequently in the film, which I've never seen in any other versions.  Again it wasn't a bad translation, but just the choice of words that I had issue with.

The English Dub track is a joke, as I figured it would be; I prefer the Cantonese anyway.  The English track is ""hot"" during the entire movie, meaning that even during scenes where there is music only you can still hear the English track running ""on top"" of it.  It's like a microphone recording white\blank noise.  I'm guessing it's like this because it probably overlaid the existing track.

Also, the music volume is a bit weak.  This has been a problem for other Killer releases as well, but it seemed like the music track could have been pumped up a bit more.  It sounds a little lower than the voice volume, and it should be the opposite.

Video-wise the movie is in 1080i, which I haven't seen before.  I thought all Blu Rays were supposed to be 1080p.  Not a big deal; I mentioned the movie looks fantastic.  Maybe it because I got a new tv, but slow mo scenes look marginally sped up or faster compared to my older DVD.  I don't know if this was just because the video is much better, or it it has something to do with 1080i.  I prefer the slower look of the DVD but the speed up wasn't bad.  The movie also appears to be in the correct aspect ratio.  When Dragon Dynasty released Hard Boiled on DVD they zoomed in on the movie to make a 1.85 move into 1.78 so that it filled up a widescreen tv.  This cut off the sides of the movie slightly.  No evidence of that here.

Flaws aside, this is a must own for fans of the movie.  Just don't get this movie expecting a Criterion quality level of subtitles, bonus features, etc.  Props to Dragon Dynasty for releasing John Woo movies (and other Asian films) that we would otherwise not be able to get here in the US.",1269993600,5,2790,4.308285163776493
4075789,3,B0036BDQLA,"The Killer is one of my all time favorite films. Next to Red Cliff (and maybe Hard Boiled) this is easily John Woo's best film and an absolute must see for action fans. I was VERY excited at the news for a re-release because I felt Dragon Dynasty did a terrific job with Hard Boiled a couple years back. As far as this Blu-ray goes though? I'm just glad I kept my original DVD release.

To start I will mention that I watch all of my Blu-ray movies on my PS3 and I have no idea how these run on an actual Blu-ray player. That being said the 30-60 second 'please wait' message is annoying (this might be a typical problem, but I never had to wait for any of my other Blu-ray's to load). The picture quality sometimes looks really slick and other times looks like an american soap-opera camera. I realise this is what Blu-ray does to pictures and probably looks great with some movies, but 20+ year old movies not so much (especially when you realise the picture was MEANT to be grainy). The audio also seems a bit off.

One thing I will say is good is the subtitle translation. It's not that different from the original DVD release but the dialogue's alot better written and a bit cooler (It's Jong instead of Jeff and his and Lee's nicknames are now Small. B and Shrimp Head instead of Dumbo and Mickey Mouse).

The extras on this disc are decent (and interview with John Woo, some deleted scenes). You learn there were some little touches that diretor John Woo added for this special release (though mostly unneccessary).

Again I'm not at all complaining about the movie itself. If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to check out John Woo's The Killer. However you might want to opt for the DVD version instead of this lack-luster Blu-Ray .",1269907200,3,1751,4.411764705882353
4075790,4,B0036BDQLA,"This review is for the Dragon Dynasty DVD release.

I read the negative Dragon Dynasty comments and viewed still images before the movie was re-released and decided
to take a chance anyway and make the purchase. I am happy with my purchase.

The only other copies I own of ""The Killer"" is the old Fox Lorber release which was great for its days and an even older VHS tape
beat to death over the years.

I prefer the Dragon Dynasty release as it is much cleaner and brighter then past versions as played on my up-converting JVC at 1080p.
It is not up to par with the Dragon Dynasty re-release of ""Hardboiled"" as the 5.1 audio track was not included on the DVD
but considering I originally watched ""The Killer"" in mono it does not bother me. The 2.1 audio track is clean and
the overdub is considerably better then past Asian films I have viewed which on occasion are filmed soundless and audio added after the film shoot ends.

Well there are some minor discrepancies of the character names I noticed twice. I have to attribute that to translation differences
that were not corrected by Dragon Dynasty but I was so engrossed in the movie I only noticed them the second time I watched the film.

The Dragon Dynasty re-release of ""The Killer"" is certainly better then most I own and like I said I am happy with the purchase.

Purists will disagree with my review but not everyone will agree with one another all of the time. I can see their points but
I am happy to finally have a version of ""The Killer"" that is bright and clean with audio I can enjoy abet 2.1.",1269907200,6,1559,4.395833333333333

I think it's fair to say that John Woo has somewhat unconventional, albeit wonderfully off-the-wall ways to 'make a point', or even give a message. I still recall when he visited Dublin in the 1990's, just prior to the Irish release of his first US film, 'Hard Target', which was screened as part of a one-day John Woo marathon; in the course of the Q&A he was asked about the hospital scene at the climax of 'Hard Boiled' and he said something along the lines of ""those children are our (Hong Kong's) future; we need to protect our future"".
You gotta love a man, never mind a filmmaker, who uses that method to make that point, and justifying it, too!

Concocting an amoral killer - moral cop mutual admiration society bullet-ballet movie around their shared love of a beautiful singer who'd been blinded, unintentionally, by the killer, is probably just as much leftfield; setting the scene of her hoped-for 'miraculous recovery' in a church of a million lit candles is just as left-field inspired, too, and has also brought a broad smile to my face.

It's got shoot-outs a plenty (more bullets than there are fish in the sea); it's got a beautiful leading lady and TWO handsome male leads for the ladies, but guys' guys too. And its got double-crosses and explosions and plenty of people running around like headless chickens.
And it's got a charming genius director!

8389789,5,B0036BDQLA,"The Killer
This is how to do an over the top bloody action movie right! The killer is definitely one of the greatest Hong Kong action movies of all time! Directed by John Woo, and Starring Chow Yun Fat. I'll explain this film in a nutshell. A Hit-man Named Ah Jong ""actor name: chow yun fat"" was on an assassin mission. While in the mint's of this assassination, A singer named Jennie was blinded in a crossfire of bullets, that seared her eyes shut. Ah Jong felt responsible for her injuries. Jennie and Ah-Jong soon become a couple, 6 months after the shootout ""keep in mind that she does not know that he was the assassin"". Meanwhile a cop named: Danny Lee has an investigation to track down this hit-man. What I like about this film is that the Hit-man and the cop are equally matched, and become almost like rivals. ""like you see in the picture below."" Also there's this strange love triangle with Jennie. Anyway, there's more to this movie then what I just explained. You'll have to experience the rest of it yourself. The killer is a must see for action movie fans. The killer holds a 7.9 rating on IMDb and a 100%/100 % on rotten tomato's (which is pretty good). I'll give this movie 5 Stars.",1505174400,2,1200,4.4343891402714934
