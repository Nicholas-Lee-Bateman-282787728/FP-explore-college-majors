This is an interesting view of the Mexican Revolution, which we in the US don't know that much about, so on educational grounds only, this is worth seeing.

Visually it is lovely although the DVD version apparently doesn't live up to the original.  The acting style is very much typical of the time, with the proud brunette beauty spewing fire out of her eyes in most every scene.  One man commented on how enticing her arrogance was....so obviously this was a prized trait in the culture of that time.  For me, I found her one-dimensional acting style a little wearing...so much fire and ice...with little subtlety to make her more interesting. I also, with my modern eyes, picked at little things like her perfect eye liner in the remote dusty Mexican village, while the other women were plain-faced...(probably why they hated her!) Even in the scene of her death, her cherry red lipstick is smudge-free and she has only one very neat bullet hole in her forehead, so her beauty remained unmarred.

I found the male lead, the peasant hero, played beautifully by Pedro Armendarez, much more engaging.  He plays it macho, true, even to the point of throwing his ladylove around a little to ""appease his virtue"" before he embraces her....But he has a charm that goes beyond the stereotype, at least to my eyes.  (female eyes) He is physically strong and graceful and is perfectly believable as a charismatic peasant who rises to the position of a Revolutionary leader. (He looks good,too, in his white peasant clothes and pancho and later in his military uniform.) I found the last scene, in which he rides, expressionless, after having discovered the death of his beloved, very moving.  Without doing anything he expressed profound emotion.

There is some great music here...especially the folk ballads sung hauntingly by two young men, who appear in moments of great emotional intensity for the hero.  It's sort of like he is not permitted to show his feelings so we have this poignant music which does it for him.

There is also a very interesting scene in which the peasant men are at work, processing something (pulco?) in bins.  They sing as they work although ""singing"" isn't exactly the right word.  The sound they make is something like chanting but that isn't it, either.  It reminded me of songs that Black slaves used to sing while working in the fields  or prison gangs while doing road work.  It's strange and intense and adds wonderfully to the overall mood of the time and place.

All in all this is a lovely film that depicts another time and place...both that of the Revolution and that of the era in which the movie was made.",1174176000,,2785,4.716942148760331
7991923,5,B00009MGGD,"Another gem featuring the acting duo of Pedro Armendariz  and Maria Felix in tale of choices. The focus is mostly on  Maria Felix who is  La Escondida(The Hidden One). She is the hidden one because she is the woman of a powerful military man during the turbulent Mexcian Revolution and it's aftermath power struggle. Pedro Armendariz is Felix's peasant lover who becomes a federal soldier and returns only to find her having moved on. The opening of the movie sets the stage  with Maria Felix riding in a train as some poor vendors sell their wares through the windows which takes her back to her humble beginning in flash back to her days as a poor vendor. She stares out the window and in the reflection sees herself and the viewer suddenly sees a younger Maria Felix selling on board the train. From this point the story unfolds of a woman torn between her roots and the people she left behind. She confronts this issue in typical Maria Felix dramatic flair. She plays the uppity woman to the hilt . Eventually she must make a decision between Armendariz and her powerful military man. Armendariz is perfect and plays the proud macho who rejects her; or so we think. The cinematography is spectacular, especially some of the scenes where Armendariz is tied to the giant centurty plants, like Jesus on a cross  and Maria Felix as his Mary Magdelen at his feet with amazing blue skies highlighting the imagery. Although the transfer is not great it is not all that bad either (hey, at least it is in sync!)since it reveals in color the true artistry of sets, camera work , huge casts and top notch performers in a celluloid synthesis that results in a great movie. The chaos and the power struggle of early twentieth century Mexico is a nice backdrop to a fine performances by Felix and Armendariz. Maria Felix, the ever passionate woman is as bold and beautiful as ever. The movie makes a social statement about  class struggle after the Mexican Revolution. A great Mexican movie with some spectacular vistas, scenes with hundreds of soldiers engaged in combat or celebration and of course, one of the best actresses to emerge from Mexico, the late, great, Maria Felix, La Dona. Recommended for old time movie buffs.",1073865600,9,2218,4.703608247422681
