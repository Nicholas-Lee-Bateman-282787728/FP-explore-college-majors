Those of us that have experienced this can relate with the events which were portrayed here. Fine job showing how the officers deal throughout their careers.",1394496000,,332,4.910714285714286
8627574,5,B00GU4X9GW,"This movie was great! I really enjoyed it. The main actress did a really great job showing what the effects are of PTSD and by the end of the film, you wanted more. The writing was really good, they all did a great job. It showed the domino effect of a traumatic event in ones life and how others are affected.",1394409600,,310,4.098360655737705

8627578,4,B00GU4X9GW,"I rated the film with four stars instead of five only because I was a little lost with the writing of certain characters in the beginning but did figure out later in the film, just me most likely. Short of that the film was engaging, well written, and very emotional. The lead character's journey was a tough one, coming to grips with the incident that hurt her to the core. I like films that tug at the heart and this film came through for me. Rachel's portrayal of this character's emotional roller coaster was flawless.",1390176000,,522,4.505263157894737
8627579,5,B00GU4X9GW,Five stars for Rachel Alig's excellent portrayal of disturbed officer Becky Rooks. The fast paced look into Chicago's police officer's lives gives a realistic glimpse of the hardships they encounter. Kudos to the director Richard Bakewell. Must see production!,1388620800,,260,5.6923076923076925
