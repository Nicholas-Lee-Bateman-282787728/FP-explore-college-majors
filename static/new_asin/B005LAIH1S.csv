4741171,5,B005LAIH1S,"This is Tyler Perry's best movie. His attention to believable characters with a nitty-gritty reality to their problems creates an atmosphere of intense interest and compassion for the
characters. I can't wait to get a DVD of this film. I saw it in the theater and was mesmerized.",1334016000,45,279,4.833333333333333
4741172,3,B005LAIH1S,The movie was just o.k. the ending was good. But i am starting to wander if Tyler is running out of material. Look to me the same ole same ole. But good ending.,1332547200,5,160,3.878787878787879
4741173,3,B005LAIH1S,"(***Spoilers are included so beware***)Wow. For once can people review a movie for what it is, does and shows. I think the plot for the movie was good but that's where it ended for me. The plot; man see life from new point of view/woman and changes life around. As another reviewer stated (This movie has the feel of ""The Pursuit of Happiness"") the actions of almost all the characters was too unbelievable and stupid for me to feel for them (save Gabriel Union).Lets start with Wesley Deeds (TP).  He comes from money, very smart and has a beautiful live-in girlfriend. However does not want the position at his fathers company, so predicable that girl friend knows his thoughts word for word, line for line and does what ever his mother says. Now on to Lindsey Wakefield (Thandie Newton). Can't get to work on time, Can't get her child to school on time, does not pay the rent or any bills, car falling apart etc...  Yet seems to have the inner sight on philosophy and had to relax and live life... really????? You can't get your child to school, leave child in car alone etc.. Yet you're giving advice to others.  Maybe I'm being picky but let me break it down this way.
1. If he is that predictable and boring, what woman would want to be with him and really say they love him and enjoy the relationship? She Natalie (Gabrielle Union) said at the beginning of the movie she did not like the predictable ways about him. Why would you move in and live with that type of person?
2. Walter (Brian White) character is way too much of a loose cannon to be working in an office environment. They made his roll way over edge for no reason.  They take his car keys away????? Really???? That's the only way to keep him from driving with a suspended license????. IF YOU HAVE MONEY YOU CAN GET A CAR AND DRIVE!!!!. LEGAL OR ILLEGAL... WTF!!! That just did not make sense.
3.  Lindsey Wakefield (Thandie Newton) - You live in a city and don't know anyone????? No co-workers, friends, neighbors in the same building, your child class mates parents etc.... You just don't know anyone at all.???? WTF??? You take your child to a homeless shelter?????? Really when you have a car and any FOOL has seen enough bad things about shelters to know you don't go there unless you`ve exhausted 50 places or ideals to spend the night. THAT WAS JUST DUMB. Going to the dirtiest gas station in San Francisco and that was dumb and stupid.
4. **** The one good thing**** Natalie (Gabrielle Union) her role did come with some feelings to it. I loved they way she stated the problem in their relationship and why she went out drinking etc.. How she wanted to do things more spontaneous with him etc.. She again has taken a step forward in her acting.
5. Woman down or her luck and faith, finds a good man. He comes to her rescue just in the nick of time and they get together. ""And they lived happily ever after""... The End....Yeah right.
I can't see myself ever wanting to see this more then once and not sure how others feel. The ending was so over the top that it really made me think that (TP) has just run out of ideas for projects. As I've said before ""Really""??? You just stood up for yourself for the first time in years and you go to Africa??? Not even a trip to the Islands or South America with your new girlfriend??  Let's just take the child out of school that she has been getting too late for weeks and move her to Africa..WTF??? I did like the use of a new city (San Francisco) other than Atlanta. The music was also different and nice use of old songs like(Cyndi Lauper - time after time etc.) I want to give this less stars with the over the top actions but the over all production was good and again I loved the plot. So I'll split the difference 3 Stars.",1332115200,11,3746,4.375
4741174,5,B005LAIH1S,"I cried several times during the movie. I really loved the contrast between all the characters. The story telling was incredibly touching, it was delivered in a very realistic way. Incredible acting by all, loved Thandie in this, and I thought this was Tyler's best acting gig ever.",1331683200,57,282,4.895833333333333
4741175,5,B005LAIH1S,"Once again, Tyler Perry delivers a story that not only focuses on a woman's Cinderella life but also includes a kind hearted man's point of view. Great performances from Tyler Perry, Thandie Newton, Phylicia Rashad and Brian White. And i'm SO glad to see Gabrielle Union on the big screen again!

4741807,2,B005LAIH1S,"All the time I was watching this movie, I kept thinking, ""Where have I seen this before?"" Then I remembered...it was a movie starring Will Smith called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pursuit-of-Happyness-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000N6U0E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pursuit of Happyness (Widescreen Edition)</a>. This seems to be a feminized and inferior  copy of that movie, with the actress who played the wife of that story's protagonist, Thandie Newton, in the lead role. Like the Chris Gardner character, she's homeless with a child (instead of a son, here we have a daughter), and keeps running into dilemma after dilemma. They threw in a dull, predictable love story and some family drama, I guess, to make it differ from ""Pursuit"". However, this story isn't nearly as good and as inspirational as that movie was. Tyler Perry plays a kind, good hearted wealthy businessman who is engaged to another woman but stuck in a rut, helps Thandie's character out, and eventually falls in love with her. It's about 45 minutes too long and the ending is totally unrealistic.  Maybe if you believe in fairy tales,  Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, then it'll work for you.  I like Tyler and the cast was fine,  but there is a familiar pattern to his films that clicks at times, and other times it doesn't. He'll make a really good movie but then follow it up with a mediocre one...and that's the best way to describe this film. For die-hard TP fans only, who refer to anything he does as ""great"" or ""he's done it again""...I guess they don't mind seeing the same story time and time again....at least it's with different people each time. As for everyone else, they'll find it boring. Save your money and wait to watch it on BET instead.",1463616000,,1783,5.13448275862069

4743180,5,B005LAIH1S,"Good Deeds expressed concern for the homeless, fatherless, and those who are bound by the selfish expectations of family members.  Fathers were especially absent.
 Also, this movie presented a financially successful black man who is considerate although emotionally bound.  He breaks free after facing the truth learned from a black woman.  Good Deeds' omitted most essential marriage principles, but included examples of  the dangers of self centeredness which can be applied without regard to racial, social, or financial situations.",1407196800,,535,5.7215189873417724

His plays and movies are good as the Medea character but its getting old.  This is fresh, witty, exciting and kind of sad.  The supporting actors and actresses were spot on.  Perry's acting abilities shined through and through, totally enjoyed the plot. If he keeps this up I can see him winning a Grammy!.",1403395200,,410,4.413333333333333

4743466,3,B005LAIH1S,"The theme is morally satisfying, but the editing needs work. Too many cutaways to the SF skyline. Also, no way that the mother AND daughter would with a day's notice have valid  passports to go to ""Africa.""  Which country in Africa or were they going to every country in Africa?  Still a cute film.",1402963200,,298,4.481481481481482

4743547,3,B005LAIH1S,"The outcome was typical  Tyler Perry meaning we all knew it was going to be a very sugary ending.  Tyler Perry was so unbelievable in the romantic department, but in all other aspects of the movie he did pretty good because he can act.  Now the person who was  horrible in the role was his brother -- he went so overboard in his portrayal of an angry bitter younger brother which I totally didn't get because Tyler in the role of the eldest and wiser brother didn't deserve the negative treatment from his younger brother.  Gabrielle and Thandie were very good in their roles.",1401753600,,576,4.5
4743548,5,B005LAIH1S,"I bought this for my wife's collection,but I liked it so it now rest in my collections. The mother remines me of my own mother and some of her ways of controlling things. Great movie Mr. Tyler Perry.",1401408000,,199,4.2631578947368425
4743549,3,B005LAIH1S,"I had expected more comedy, but this movie is definitely a drama. It centers on the relationship between the brothers; the younger brother is so spoiled as to be unbelievable and he gets tiresome almost from the first scene. Lindsey Wakefield also acts much younger, and her mouth would have gotten her fired long before she met Mr. Deeds. Deeds' fiance Natalie was a modern, smart woman, but Rashad's character was one-sided and could have been played out a bit more to explain Deeds' background.",1401321600,,497,4.858823529411764
4743550,5,B005LAIH1S,Great story line which touched the soul and shows that everyone has a designed path in which to walk. It was very entertaining.,1401321600,,127,4.565217391304348
4743651,5,B005LAIH1S,This movie is extremely easy to watch and enjoy.  There are issues that could be expanded.  But why?  Sometimes you need something easy to watch.  And Tyler Perry's Good Deeds does that for me.,1401148800,,193,4.588235294117647

4743655,5,B005LAIH1S,Good movie. Love that he shows black people in successful business situations. All too often black people are regulated to being typecast as athletes or hoodlums...Tyler Perry continously breaks that mold.,1400630400,,205,5.645161290322581
4743656,5,B005LAIH1S,I liked this movie. I like the way Tyler Perry always has lessons to be learned in his movies. I like to watch funny movies with a good ending.,1400544000,,143,3.9655172413793105

4743658,5,B005LAIH1S,"I really enjoyed this movie, because I feel it shows that no matter what economic standing is in life. You should always live for yourself and not for the happiness of others. ""To thine self be true.""",1400371200,,200,4.4324324324324325
4743659,4,B005LAIH1S,"Turned out I enjoyed this movie much more then anticipated.  It probably deserves a 3.5 but when  a movie surprises you you give it a little extra rating,",1400371200,,154,4.464285714285714
4743660,5,B005LAIH1S,"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Mr. Deeds used to be predictable until he met the Janitor. That's where he found his escape.

4743751,4,B005LAIH1S,"This was an interesting movie to watch, it shows how people have to deal with very serious life and financial difficulties. And on the other hand how we have generous people with care and financial means who help them out. I liked it and have watched it a few times.",1400112000,,266,4.34
4743752,1,B005LAIH1S,"My wife and I watched this movie together, and really found the first 2 acts to be enjoyable. By no means a perfect movie, but entertaining and interesting.

The final act just feels rushed though, like maybe it was edited too much. Character actions become irrational, like everybody becomes schizophrenic at the end.

Overall I liked the story, I mostly enjoyed the acting, just the final act killed it for me. My wife put it best when she said ""For a movie about a predictable guy learning to live his own life rather than what other people want for him, it is a shame the end of the movie was completely predictable and forced"".",1399939200,,632,4.535087719298246

4743754,4,B005LAIH1S,"Cast was good and plot was entertaining, if a little unbelievable at times. Phyliss Rashad  had some tremendous ""stares"" that could
have killed (especially toward her younger son) which were very effective. Movie also effectively hits at several stereotypes, e.g., blood should always be thicker than water, people have the same views whethedr from different social/economic or even the same social/economic background (in short, people are individuals not just members of groups), predictability is always good, etc. However, I did think the ending was not totally realistic (passports already in hand?)",1399852800,,604,5.637362637362638

4743757,3,B005LAIH1S,"I gave up on Tyler Perry's films long ago, but because I like Gabrielle Union and Thandie Newton I decided to give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised! Yes there are plot holes and yes the plot is predictable, but most romance films have those issues. I especially liked the portrayal of the single mother and how her life could go from bad to hideous very quickly. It was hard to watch and depressingly realistic, although of course her rescue was not. Felicia Rashad, not one of my favorites, was very good as the icy mother. Recommended.",1399593600,,543,4.551020408163265

4743825,2,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler used to have a Christ centered message, so to go from that to hearing a character saying ""Oh my G*d"" ( the casual use of it is making Him seem small and unimportant) was disappointing.  His movies just aren't special anymore, driving in a luxury car and living for himself just isn't impressive.  Even the trip to Africa was about living for self. He is a talented filmmaker I just wasn't thrilled about the underlying message.",1399248000,,433,4.6103896103896105
4743826,5,B005LAIH1S,A movie about a man who finds the gentle side of his heart and uses it to help a woman and her daughter.  In the end he finds the woman and daughter too.

4743977,5,B005LAIH1S,This movie is in Tyler Perry style and has good messages.  The lady has incredibly bad luck and everything goes bad in her life.  She ends up in the street and Mr. Deeds hires her as the cleaning lady at his company.  He has always had a life of privilege and has always been predictable in life.  The cleaning lady really shakes his life up and they both learn about each others life.  Very good movie would recommend.,1397001600,,419,4.32051282051282

Great story! Tyler's character honors his parents, does a good deed for a stranger (with grace!), he's his brother's keeper.  Gabrelle's character I really appreciate, she knew though he was a great guy, he wasn't for her.  Ladies, what's for you is for you! Mama Deeds, OMG!

One scene should have been deleted from his movie to keep him true to his word and for that, I warn parents that are cautious with movies around their children to not let the children see that scene.  Otherwise the movie is good, has a theme, something to teach the audience.  Put together really good.  It's just the one scene.",1394323200,,467,4.395348837209302

this is a great movie that tells a story about a very successful kind hearted man and his compassion.
to the suffering for a single mother, (widow) this should transcends race or color and it should  make us all relate somehow to the sufferings in life.
Tyler Perry is a great story teller and although the end is somehow predictable, he does a terrific job with with his character development in such a way that their performance brings almost every gamma of human emotions from corruption to redemption and everything in between, something we can all relate.
I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it, if you see it as a Black movie, you will loose a lot of his intended purpose, watch it as a Human drama and you will find yourself with more than a good feeling at the end :)",1393977600,,858,4.464968152866242

With this film, not only did I like it, but I was WOW'd by it. In addition to entertaining me, it was also carried out a very relatable storyline in regard to the number of single mothers in our society who daily face similiar circumstance. The working poor and their plight. This movie made laugh, it made me cry, but most of all, it lefting me wishing it didn't have to end.  I felt as though I were a particular character, living out my life, and even as the ending credits started to roll, I found myself wishing for announcer to say...""Now, here's rest of the story."" Some of the films entertainment ""bang for your buck"" arose from really good supporting actors like Union, Rashad, Cibrian and White. As far as Perry himself, I've never seen him play a character this raw and vulnerable.  IMHO, his scenes with Newton, and child actress, Jordenn Thompson, show cased his range of acting abilities at their absolute best. In addition to good acting and a strong storyline, I liked the set design and wardrobe.  Both appeared to be professionally well excuted.  Something I've not always thought true of all TP movies.

In the beginning he exaggerates the exhaust sound coming from his Porsche (overlay-ed the sound of a big block American V8) to his brothers unrealistic over the top anger (there are other examples but I don't want to give the move away in case you decide to watch it).

There are some touching scenes and moments. But I was reminded over and over of how poorly it was made by the exaggerations and poor continuity. It could have been a great movie.",1392076800,,587,4.528301886792453

Just follow your dreams. I watch it about 50 times. It was really good.  The rich and famous are not always happy. They need understanding and love also. The poor are going thru some hard times and can make it if they follow their dreams. Sometimes love is blind. You have to look at your self and say what do I want in life and go after it. If you are a single parent there is hope for you. Some men do want a family. It's what you want and you can be the very best. Go after your dream.,1391817600,,648,3.8721804511278197

4744758,4,B005LAIH1S,"I just can't for the life of me understand WHY anyone would give this movie ONE STAR??? Really??? Probably the same people who rate zombie strippers and sharknado four stars. Good grief. It was a great film. Why does every movie nowadays have to be shoot-em-up action, over the top raunchy comedy, or a drama tragedy to get decent ratings? Keep doing what you're doing Tyler Perry!!",1391472000,,382,4.7164179104477615

4744762,5,B005LAIH1S,"I was a bit skeptical of this movie, due to Tyler's larger role as an actor and I worried I would only be able to see him as Madea. Well, I was able to put that image aside and enjoy his scenes. I am a longtime fan of Ms. Newtons, so I was happy to see her range of emotions. This is an excellent story of redemption and freedom. Growth is made possible my tough times, but it sure is worth it!",1391385600,,394,3.817073170731707

Tyler Perry is so right on with his movies and always seem to have the RIGHT message in them all. The mother tried to do everything for her self and her child but found out that you have to get some help sometime. All the characters were so believable and perfect for the roles that they played. A must see for all !",1390176000,,457,4.032967032967033

However since this is a rating on the movie its self and not the streaming system it does it 5 stars.  It is an amazing movie with a great set of characters I think personal it is one of his best movies yet.",1390089600,,466,4.155555555555556

4744976,3,B005LAIH1S,"My boyfriend and I watched this during our weekly movie night.  We both kept talking to the screen because we wanted the love interests to get together sooner.  It was obvious, so I don't know what the hold up was.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it lacked some of the laughs of his former films.  My boyfriend and I also thought the movie's pace was slow.  There was a scene where they could have easily taken the movie in a more interesting direction, but it turned out to be another part of the film that slowed down the pace.  Finally, the couple that was together and broke up had no chemistry, and it should have been obvious to them that they were not happy together.  They didn't admit this until the end of the film.  Again, that slowed the movie's pace down.  Phylicia Rashad was the best part of the movie.  She's a timeless beauty and talent.  I wish she could have been given more lines in the movie.  Overall, 3 out of 5 from Stephanie and Tobias!  :)",1389830400,,972,4.245901639344262

4745122,4,B005LAIH1S,"...Even better to view it FREE as a perk of Prime.

My negative comment is that I can tell that Tyler is not a seasoned ""main character"" in this movie. Some of the dialogue between Tyler and the ladies seems off. The constant tears appear to be fake. Once again (as in most of TP's movies), a lady in distress is rescued by a loving man. But, if this formula works for Tyler, GREAT!!",1389744000,,383,4.175675675675675

Some of us need the encouragement and warmth that you deliver in these stories about the Good in people. Stories about good people working through tough times, and taking the high road.  I am SO happy I finally ran across this movie and ignored some of the so-called critics.  This movie is fantastic, and is deeply touching, moving and inspirational.

4745451,5,B005LAIH1S,"I have seen all the Tyler Perry movies and some of the plays so I am a bit of a fan of his movies generally. This is because the stories tend to have a lot of stuff that we take for granted examined and highlighted. While he is not afraid of having positive role models, he is also not afraid of showing their flaws and showing them not to be perfect. In truth the stories and movies are closer to reality than a lot of other movies. Good deeds does not disappoint. It challenges your thinking about love and family and what it takes to make a relationship work and last. It lets you examine common mistakes made by people that are one payment/ salary away from being on the street and the reality that they confront.
I strongly recommend this movie and if you haven't yet seen it the Temptation movie, in that one even more texture to the characters and actions, great job.",1387411200,,874,4.303030303030303

Great acting, good timing with editing, fun dynamics between characters.  More subtlety on the sex scene (which conveyed certain movement in the plot) would have made this a 4 star.

-Unlikely, but believable plot
-Genuine performances from all actors
-Eddie Cibrian's dimples (that was a personal pro)

Cons
-I love Thandie Newton, but her American accent is horrible in this film and it is distracting at times, especially in the serious parts of the film
-The vital supporting characters in the film are lacking a strong back story (i.e. the brother)

4746411,5,B005LAIH1S,"I love everything about this movie.  The actors & actresses are so believable!  I enjoy seeing Tyler Perry acting himself instead of  as Madea even though he does an incredible job at that.

The soundtrack is so great!  I am not familiar with the artist who is singing but he is really good.  I am so proud of all of Tyler's works.

God has brought Tyler a mighty long way and I am glad that he was able to help Oprah ""turnaround""  her OWN Channel.",1376006400,,448,4.188235294117647

4746413,2,B005LAIH1S,"I thought this movie was going to be very predictable, but it ended up only being predictable in a few parts. There are some glaring plot holes, however.

1. At the airport, how did Deeds' mother get past the gate without a ticket? You haven't been able to do that in 12 years!

2. How did the single mom and her daughter get passports in less than 12 hours?!

3. Deeds keeps telling the mouthy single mom that ""no one has ever talked to me like that"". But for the first hour of the movie, NO ONE speaks to Deeds with any respect at all except for a few perfunctory  interactions with the dimpled white dude in the office. Deeds' brother is always yelling and mouthing off to him. His fiance is bored with him and speaks to him with contempt. So it doesn't really make sense that this bratty, foul-mouthed single mom with a mega-attitude who uses disturbingly racist speech (yessa massa!) would be attractive to Deeds at all.

I guess Perry was following the lame Hollywood cliche which is that a man who has beautiful, young, articulate, fun women all around him will fall for the old bitchy single mom who behaves horribly towards him and has nothing to offer except ""stop caring what other people think!"" (which, btw, worked so well for the bratty woman as she loses jobs and her kid because of her bad attitude)

Anyway, the movie was ok. Unintentionally funny at times. And there were a few scenes where I was sure one plot point would happen, but it didn't, so the movie wasn't as predictable as other fluffy romance movies.",1375660800,2,1530,4.485611510791367

It was refreshing to see that the love story did not end with the 'perfect couple' getting together.  The love story was more like real life.",1374451200,,384,4.162162162162162

I was a little annoyed with the brother, Brian White; like why was he so angry?? Nothing was really shown about him, he was just a big jerk onscreen. And I'm sorry but TP doesn't have enough ""swag"" to pull off this character. It was awkwarddddd watching that scene between him and Gab Union and every time he raises his voice all I hear is Madea lol.

4746822,4,B005LAIH1S,This was not a usually Tyler Perry film and I believe that's why it was so great. The story line was not original but not to much is these days. The casting was brilliant and the acting was equally so. Thandie Newton was so believable that I cried during a few of her scenes. I recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have a preconceived judgement of Mr. Perry and is open and accepting.,1373068800,,390,4.283783783783784

I was kind of pissed of at the story itself Geez I have a few friends who are nursing students and they all have jobs while they study. They also make good money because nurses are in high demand and they haven't even graduated! So you mean she almost got her degree(one year left to go) and she could not find a job in the medical field? Really? How realistic is that? Nobody gives a woman they just met who was rude to them a house. It just doesn't happen. No homeless person has time to ask people if they know how much milk costs. They are too busy trying to get on their feet. And they are not too proud to look for help.,1372896000,,692,4.095588235294118

4746901,1,B005LAIH1S,"Sometimes I think Tyler Perry has a kind of a Mad Libs pad that he fills in to write his story lines. __________(woman's name) meets _____________(man's name) and they immediately dislike each other because of ____________.

He must be the only one who can't see that his movies are all the same, only the names and places change. I mean really, if you've seen one Tyler Perry movie, you've seen them all. The best thing about this movie is that there is no heavy handed religious message, no stirring black choirs to whip you into a frenzy of sanctified redemption. Of course, no Madea either, which is usually the only good part of his movies.

The most disturbing thing about this movie, aside from the contrived story line and stilted dialog, and ridiculously unbelievable plot, is watching Tyler Perry pretend to have sex. Thanks Mr. Perry, now I'll have to bleach my eyes.

I liked the story of a man who's lived his life according to what others wanted from him versus what he wanted for himself in the face of a jealous brother who opts to destroy the family business Tyler's character heads (since he can't dethrone Tyler's character as CEO).  The film is well-casted and well-performed (Gabrielle Union, Thandie Newton, Phylicia Rashad, Eddie Cibrian, Rebecca Romijian--and, yes, Tyler Perry). Nevertheless, there's something missing overall from this Cain vs. Abel story that makes it somewhat hollow.  It's that very thing which kept it from being a great story rather than merely a good story.  Otherwise, this is the quintessential date movie, perhaps even a ""chick flick"" with lots of integrity and earnest story-telling.",1368316800,,864,5.020979020979021

4747058,3,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler Perry plays Wesley Deeds, a businessman who manages his family business without any love for it and is hated for it by his brother ( Brian White). He has a very managed life and does not do anything that is out of the ordinary. As he is getting to settle down with a Natalie ( Gabrielle Union), Lindsey ( Thandie Newton) enters his life. She is struggling with her roles as a single mom and Deeds helps her a lot. Things start changing for him quickly and he starts to question his purpose in life, his relationship with Union and his family, his businessman persona and ultimately his feelings for Natalie.
This is a cliched film to boot, every frame is predictable and the characters also seem to be very pretentious and unforgettable in their roles- except White. Despite its many weaknesses the film is watchable and for that I must credit Perry and his  very professional direction. Tyler Perry has consistently managed to make watchable but predictable movies and this one is no exception. However it is sad to see that an actress such as Union wasted in a very small role. The movies predictable pace is saved by high production values but a weak ending somehow renders it all useless. This is not a bad movie - but with a fairly safe plot. 3 stars.  5/5/2013",1368144000,,1272,4.550218340611353

4747351,2,B005LAIH1S,"Gabrielle Union was treated like an old pair of shoes that are worn out and tossed aside or donated to the salvation army, and Thandie Newton was treated like a race horse that will save the day but she was being fed nothing but hogwash! Hogwash is worthless, false, or ridiculous speech or writing; nonsense, Garbage fed to hogs, A mixture of liquid and solid food, such as table scraps, fed to animals, especially pigs; slop.
Why?  Mr Deeds did not present himself as a man worth keeping or staying with overnight. He was super disrespectful and women will always be disrespected until we learn that we are of immense value and deserve to treated as such! Why settle for a stale donut when I can have a whole cake with frosting???
  Mr Deeds would have fared better if he had gotten his life together with the aid of God and then approached a good woman ""Thandie Newton"" after much soul searching or catharsis. He tried to do this while living with one woman and with the help of the other woman. He even attempted to sleep with Thandie Newton while still living with Gabrielle. This was tackkkky!
She rebuffed (To reject bluntly, often disdainfully; snub, abrupt refusal, repel or drive back) him and put his butt out! Selah!",1365552000,,1228,4.598173515981735
4747352,2,B005LAIH1S,"I saw some things in this film that are easy to miss.  The disrespect of the value and importance of a woman was blatant.  The only relatively happy person in his
relationship(s) was Mr. Deeds (The Player). He was like so many men.  He was not happy with a little pie, so he wanted the whole pie. Gabrielle was disrespected immensely and allowed herself to be devalued rather than honored.  How not to get the guy?  Move in with him and service him daily and fix his meals and etc etc. That is not how to treat an animal(that has not put a ring on it) if you plan on keeping it for a while. You must make him thirsty!  Do not give him anything to eat or drink and he will keep coming back? He will be relentless if he is not a real dog.  If not, chalk all up to, Aint nothing but the dawg in him?

The new girl Mr Deed went after should have told him to keep stepping. He was disrespecting her also.  He may well have taken his own advice and closed that door before opening another one. Close it real good and put bars on it and a pit bull at the door to keep his butt inside the gate.  who let the dawgs out?  Mr. Deeds AKA Tyler Perry in all his films or the majority of them. Mr deeds is being a player in this movie and it was so distasteful. This is what turns many women into a Diary of a Mad black woman.  How about a movie with a guy respecting a girl and waiting until marriage?  Oh, that does not sell movie tickets. Well it does sell as far as a man worth having?  I did not find that in Mr Deeds anywhere.

Money can't buy me love is the correct phrase. Mr Deeds did not have true love.  True love is respectful and does not stray from what is morally correct. This is why there is a show called Basketballs wives.  If he disrespects you in the beginning, he will do it in the end.  The way he begins is the way he ends. Unless someone corrects his butt and tells the animal to get his feet off the couch,get some manners,respect and honor or its over!
If it does not work, consider yourself one flea less, of a headache ! ! !",1365552000,,2039,3.980295566502463

4747442,5,B005LAIH1S,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The guy that plays Wesley's brother, I think his name is Brian White, did an amazing job, as did Thandie Newton. Brian White should have won an academy award for this performance.  I found Thandie Newton's ability to display emotions in the outstanding range.  Something I would change is the ending for the movie. **Spoiler Alert** When he says he doesn't know what's out there, but he's going to find it, this was a huge let down!  Perhaps I have unrealistic expectations of Mr. Perry, because he has delivered so brilliantly in so many ways in the past, but here I think Wesley already ""found"" what he was looking for out there and it was Lindsey!  Let it be Lindsey.  That's every woman's dream. Another issue that needs to be addressed is that Wesley never tells her that he loves her in this movie.  Huh?  I need to see him realize and express his love to Lindsey.  Finally, this movie should have included a scene where they have a beautiful wedding.  At no point do we get to see Lindsey in her ""Cinderella"" moment.  I need this scene to be added!  She is still in her rags on the plane, even though Ariel has her hair done.  I think a more emotionally satisfying ending would have been for them to have a passionate kiss when he goes to see her at work and explains that he's not getting married.  This would have also been a good place for him to tell her that he loves her.  Even better, at this point he should have proposed!  In the next scene, I would like to see their wedding.  At the wedding, Ariel should be the flower girl.  Also, it would be interesting to see Brian flirting with Wesley's ex-fiance at the wedding reception, since these two like to party (Perhaps Wesley's mother will get her wish after all).  The last scene could be Wesley and Lindsey in Africa, with her in her nursing uniform (she has gone back and earned her nursing degree - yay!) and him digging wells.  It would be nice to see the two friends, who he obviously misses very much, digging the wells with him in this scene.  I love this movie.  Perhaps when Tyler does a remake in 20 years of this classic these new scenes can be added.  Thanks for making this great movie Tyler Perry!",1364515200,2,2208,4.397530864197531

Thandie Newton was not really believable as a single, struggling mother, and it seems to me that I've seen Gabrielle Union play this type of character before in almost every movie she's ever done.

4748451,4,B005LAIH1S,"This was the first one of Tyler Perry's movies that I have ever seen, but was intrigued by the story line.  The acting in it I thought went more toward old school with immotions showing in the face and actions instead of just verbal crossfires.  It made you take a look at each person perspective in the story and not just the two main characters.",1360627200,,347,4.323076923076923

4748453,5,B005LAIH1S,Tyler Perry has a way of dealing with the things in our society that most of us know about but turn a blind eye towards. If this movie does not hit you in the pit of stomach at least three times; you have no heart. Bravo Mr. Perry! Bravo!,1360454400,,238,3.877551020408163

This movie mirrored how good deeds for others is always reflected back upon ourselves.  We learn lessons, grow, and come to grips with our own frailties in the process.

This movie was endearing and touching and another Perry winner.  Highly, highly recommended.",1360195200,2,454,5.236111111111111

He is a fifth generation Ivy League graduate. He is also engaged to Natalie (Gabrielle Union) and, while they are in love, she can predict his every move and this makes their relationship unexciting. One day he meets Lindsey (Thandie Newton), a night janitor who is a single mother that just got evicted and is going through a rough time after the death of her husband in Iraq. In the process of helping her, he discovers that he has been living his life for his parents. Then he decides to live his own life and be happy.

4748751,5,B005LAIH1S,I think that this is an excellent movie. It shows us that we must seek our dreams in life instead of others. Life is short and we must enjoy it to the fullest. Tyler Perry's Good Deeds does a good job in pointing this out to us.,1356739200,,228,3.872340425531915

4748858,5,B005LAIH1S,Enjoyed Tyler's acting direction in which this story allowed him to display/showcase.  I think he has found another acting classificatiion other than comedy. Great Job.,1355443200,,168,5.72
4748859,5,B005LAIH1S,When this came to DVD I was excited beyond happiness. It's a good story and Tyler Perry always has a lesson learned in his movies. This one is about the privileged and the unprivileged with a love story thrown in.,1355184000,,213,4.35

4748930,5,B005LAIH1S,"I loved this movie because I could relate to it (somewhat). I know what it feels like to need someone or something and to not know where to find them or it. It's amazing that we live in a world filled with billions of people, yet we can feel so alone. Even when you're in a room filled with people. Great job Tyler. You really captured my attention with this one!",1353801600,,363,4.126760563380282
4748931,1,B005LAIH1S,"This movie may very well have been very entertaining except that the sound is so un-even. Part of the time it is so low that you can barely hear it and you must turn it up then it is too loud. I suspected piracy, but was assured that this is how it came to them from the factory. So, since I can't concentrate on the hearing the story because I am too busy adjusting the volume I can't say much except maybe I'll find a good copy somewhere.",1353715200,,440,4.011363636363637

4748934,1,B005LAIH1S,"Once again, Tyler Perry delivers a story that not only focuses on a woman's hated toward the black man but also includes a foolish point of view. Wrack performances from Tyler Perry, Thandie Newton, Phylicia Rashad and Brian White. When the movie ended I was SO glad to see Gabrielle Union off the big screen again! I can't wait to add this movie to my worst movie collection!",1353196800,,376,4.544117647058823

4748937,5,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler Perry did a great job in this movie, first you see him as a successful businessman with a pretty fiance'(Gabrielle Union) who knows him like the boring book that he is.. and then you see the difference between him and his brother (Brian White) and their relationship with their mother (Phylicia Rashad) who was great in her role..those eyes tell her story..and then you introduce Thandie Newton to the mix, a hardworking single mother with a little girl trying to get by the best way she can. You heart goes out to her as you see that she may not be making all the best choices, but she has a good heart. She brings to life Tyler's character's deepfelt desires and challenges him to open up to life and take a good look at his life and see there's more to him than what people see or want him to be. My favorite part is when he puts on a Tupac CD and starts crip walking, I almost fell out of my chair..he is awesome. Also when Gabrielle Unions character goes out with friend's and comes home drunk and horny is a sight to see as well. I fell in love with ""Kem"" all over again after watching this movie and hearing his song ""Can You Feel It"". I am a diehard lover of Tyler Perry's work and anyone who knows me can attest to this, so I say that to say this...Get this DVD..You will not be disappointed.",1352851200,,1307,4.232

4749013,5,B005LAIH1S,Tyler Perry playing a character other than Mabel Simmons did an extraordinary job.  The plot really contrasted the American way - privilleged versus struggling.  We never know who will cross our path and benefit us.,1351382400,,215,5.114285714285714

4749017,1,B005LAIH1S,"So far I've really liked everything Tyler Perry has done, but not this one. On the positive side, it was great seeing him do some real acting. He's a natural, with a warm charismatic personality. On the downside, it was very disappointing, to say the least, to see how his script allowed him to be in a sexually immoral relationship. Perhaps I'm mistaken but I was under the impression that he upheld Christian morals, and this film clearly does not. If he does profess to be a Christian, then in this movie he has compromised those beliefs and the reputation that he should stand for.",1349913600,3,585,4.580952380952381

4749147,4,B005LAIH1S,"The storyline was fairly predictable with a few surprises along the way, but I sometimes a enjoy a movie that addresses self discovery, heartache, hard times and coming through with a sense of purpose. This would be that film. Tyler Perry was exceptional, proving there's more to him than a wig and a bra. Thandie Newton was, as almost always, a revelation in emotional range. Gabrielle Union also showed her chops and dug into her character with honesty and, in the end, joy. It left me wondering - how did Mr. Deeds' life work out and did his brother ever challenge his personal demons. A great movie all around and one I will watch again.",1349481600,,641,4.582608695652174

4749155,5,B005LAIH1S,"This was a great movie that didn't include Tyler Perry's Madea character, but it was just as good as those movies.  It showed reality that can happen to anyone who gets down on their luck and in need of a little help.  Pride can sometimes be our worse enemy.  This movie shows that we all can do both little things and big things to help the homeless.",1348185600,,351,4.208955223880597
4749236,3,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler Perry's Good Deeds DVD is an excellent and ""must see"" movie. Very enjoyable and nice change from the Madea films. An excellent story line with outstanding characters. Quality of DVD, however, was questionable. DVD did not come with an inside pamphlet or ""flyer"" as most DVDs do, and the recorded volume level was much lower than average. I have to up the volume on my television considerably in order to hear what is being said -- not normal. I expected better from a ""just recently released"", high retail-priced film. Otherwise, this movie is an excellent choice.",1348099200,2,570,4.88659793814433
4749237,4,B005LAIH1S,Tyler Perry's Good Deeds is a movie worth watching. It's a relief from his Madea films that focuses more on a situation we are all probably very aware of. You never know what someone is going through until you take the time to talk to them. It's a feel-good film dedicated to those who want to be out of the struggle. Enjoy!,1347494400,,324,4.241935483870968
4749238,5,B005LAIH1S,"I absolutely loved this product.  I was able to consistently follow the story of the film and was not distractted by any provocative bed scenes.  If you love Tyler Perry, you will definitely enjoy this film.  It teaches that no matter how wealthy or poor individuals may be monetarily speaking, it is how we are on the inside that counts.  By watching the film, I was also reminded that no matter what relatives may expect us to do, it is important for us to follow our own dreams and goals in life.  If not, we will just feel miserable and bitter later.  If you want to enjoy another great Tyler Perry film, this item is perfect for you.  Hope you enjoy it.",1347321600,,658,4.344262295081967
4749239,5,B005LAIH1S,I was proud of Tyler Perry for this film. It was very enlightening not to see him cross-dressing and starring in a movie that cast African American in a positive light helping each other out and being respectful to one another.,1347235200,,227,4.560975609756097

4749244,3,B005LAIH1S,I am a huge T. Perry fan and was excited to see this movie after reading the reviews. Have to say it was just OK and not up to Tyler's usual standards. The sex scene with his fiance was a little disturbing and there was no faith in God thread which disappointed me. As other reviewers have said...there is no explanation as to why the characters make the decisions they do so it leaves you confused. Love Tyler- but this movie missed the mark.,1346457600,,443,4.285714285714286
4749245,5,B005LAIH1S,Goods Deeds is one of Tyler Perry's best films yet.  Would recommend this movie to any audience.  I can see myself watching it again and again.,1346112000,,143,4.461538461538462

Children are the future. **SPOILER** My ex-wife & I aren't on the best of terms, but I KNOW if she lost our daughter because she was homeless and some CEO, excuse me, ex-CEO, of some company offered her a trip around the world, she'd say no because our daughter was still going to school. And DCFS is probably monitoring her to make sure she doesn't do something stupid, like...oh, I don't know, TAKE A TRIP AROUND THE WORLD.

You come away from it feeling good - wanting to help someone as Tyler Perry (Mr. Deeds) did in the movie for this single mom and her little girl. If some woman wanted to have a few girlfriends over for a movie night, this one would be a 'winner' for sure. However, a guy could like it just fine  as there are great guy actors in the movie.  The young mother in the movie is the janitor in the huge building that wealthy Mr. Deeds owns and she is homeless and he finds out about it and gives her a big helping hand.  In the end, he finds out what life is really all about and begins to 'live'!!  It's a very sweet love story but not all mushy.

I was in tears from the very first scene. I cannot say how wonderful this project is, everything is great!! including the Writing, Producing & Directing; Tyler really lays it out by delivering an all star performance with great story telling and he displays it in a tasteful, yet eloquent manner. I simply loved this Story!!! The casting was perfect; Tandi, Rashad, Brian White, Gabrielle and Tyler were cast perfectly for this film. It's a tear-jerker so beware. Great acting by everyone. My favorites were, well simply all of them....

I'm going to order a copy so I can see it again!!! You will want to start your own life over after you see this movie; that is, for those who haven't done so already!!!  Perfect for any soon-to-be couples who want to build a solid foundation for their relationship and dictate the basis of their own personal values as opposed to someone else's ideas and views of what those values should be!! This is a great movie for you!! Tyler has never been better!!",1345420800,,1227,4.518018018018018

4749389,3,B005LAIH1S,Good story acted well but the transitions seemed a little awkward.  It was difficult for me to understand how the characters arrived at some of their decisions and the mother living out of her car scenes could have had a little more depth added to them.,1344816000,,253,4.5

Therefore the unexpected emotional waves of each character will have anyone that has a sincere love for mankind, and a strong will to do what's right, will find themselves fighting back the tears. However, not all of the teary scenes were sad ones. Yes it is that good. Way to go Mr. Deed's!! I mean Mr. Perry.",1344556800,,473,4.436781609195402

4749566,5,B005LAIH1S,"This movie was just AWESOME. Tyler Perry's character was so progammed by his parents that he forgot about his own wants and dreams.  But along comes a single mother who's pride was so large it was hard for her to ask or accept help.  When Mr. Deeds encouters her (who by the way is one of his employees)he shows what caring and helping another person can lead to doors opening in your own personal life.

4749567,3,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler Perry's concept of the central character Walter Deeds doing a good deed was right on, but his ability to act it out is poor. Walter Deeds the conflicted character is not convincing as a man too busy that he cannot stop to live the life he wants to live instead of the life he was born into.
His supporting casts are excellent with the exception of Thandie Newton who shares the unconvincing role of being desperate and destitute.
The plot and subplot is too predictable. The primary idea behind this movie is to spend millions and make three times that amount. This movies is for profit not the people.",1344211200,,608,4.536363636363636

The movie was very well written and acted out.  It's not often one has an employer who will go out of their way to help employees in need, but in this movie, that is exactly what happened.  It shows that employers are people and can be ""human"" if they choose to do so.  The movie is one that I would recommend to  others to see.",1344124800,,468,4.133333333333334

Thandie Newton, incredible and deep. Brian White outstanding. His character is confict bound which gives the movie a great twist. Phylicia Rashad, powerful and full of grace. I highly recommend this movie to every Tyler Perry fan. Tyler's projects are a must have and I am so grateful for his work as his projects inpspire, lift and cheer me up always.

4749993,5,B005LAIH1S,"Another Awesome movie by T.P.  I love his stories  -- that are typical of many African American families but no one talks about openly.  The overriding theme in this movie for me was COMMUNICATION.  If people communited thier needs and desires properly the mother wouldn't have lost her child -- although temporarily if she hadn't been so strong willed all of that trauma could have been avoided.  The brother, classic jerk.  Most times we need to move away from the shadows of what others expect of us in order to find ourselves or find our true voice -- and then, stop enabeling!  Because most people have close family ties once you help a sibling out twice (max) then it's time for them to stand on their own.  Let them fall if they must but your constant help is only helping them to stay 'lost' longer.  Great story and even greater lessons.  I will watch it again!",1341532800,,870,4.519230769230769

Say what you want, sometimes I actually enjoy a good african-american movie that don't involve drugs, guns and a lot of foul language.  Wesley Deeds lived his life by the blueprint of his parents and was so dead to it all that he masked his unhappiness with smiles.  That was, until, a attitude-laced janitor, played by Thandie Newton, came into his life and started to break down the walls, just to show him that his life was his and his alone.  For me, the standout performances belonged to Thandie Newton, who had a little too much attitude for me, but when you watch what she went thru just to keep her daughter safe and fed, I couldn't to anything buy sympathize and root for her, throughout her struggles.  The other belonged to Brian J. White, who took the self-absorbed, little brother routine to a whole 'nother level.  He was so selfish and so used to his ""dad didn't leave me the company/mom don't love me like she loves you"" viciousness that he couldn't see just how self-destructive he was.  Another winner from Mr. Perry...LOVED IT!",1340582400,,1153,4.595121951219512
4750083,1,B005LAIH1S,"I'm surprised this film only has one ""one star rating"", maybe the cast and crew submitted these reviews.  The film was dull and predictable, I'd rather spend my hour and change starring outside my window and counting atoms within raindrops.  Tyler Perry's knows what his core audience wants and they eat it up everytime and he skips to his accountant's office.  I'm mildly entertained by some of his films but this one was a complete waste of my time as the entire premise of the film was weak.",1340409600,8,494,4.590909090909091
4750084,4,B005LAIH1S,"Tyler Perry does a good job of having female characters with actual character. This story could have easily been cliche with the rich fiance huffing and puffing and scheming. No scheming in this movie at all. I liked that the most. Just a story about a guy who lost himself to the image everyone wanted to see and a girl so caught up in her pride that she wouldn't ask the right people for help, then they meet and don't immediately like each other. Their initial chemistry revolved around their need for someone to finally be honest with the other. It's one of those leave you smiling movies and worth the watch.",1340064000,2,613,4.482142857142857

4750086,4,B005LAIH1S,"Wesley Deeds is CEO of his late father's computer software company. He was born into privilege, his entire life planned out for him. Even though he has plenty of money and material things, Wesley is just existing instead of living - going through the motions... until he meets, Lindsey.

Lindsey Wakefield is a single mother struggling to make ends meet. No money for rent, money owed for back taxes - she and her daughter (Jordenn Thompson/a very talented little girl) are stuck in a bad situation and Lindsey is seriously stressed.

Wesley (Tyler Perry) was the lead male role, but his brother, Walter (Brian J. White), left more of an impression; I was still thinking about White's performance long after the movie ended. Brian J. White sure knows how to play an unlikeable character (thinking of his role in Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself), but even though Walter had issues, he was my favorite character.  At first I thought he hated women, and then I thought he just plain disliked everybody, but I think Walter had issues with himself and I think he was hurting. The man had a mouth on him, but I loved his honesty.

I know times were hard for Lindsey (Thandie Newton) and I know she was doing what she could to survive, but she was too good at lying. She was teaching her daughter to be dishonest and that bothered me. Her attitude in the beginning kept me from liking her, but she became likeable as the movie progressed.

Natalie (Gabrielle Union): As soon as the movie began I wondered why she was with Wesley if she had so many complaints about his routine. I'm glad that question was answered, because up to that point I wasn't sure how I felt about her.

Wilimena Deeds (Phylicia Rashad): She was an uppity woman who wanted everything her way. I could say she was cold hearted - especially when it came to Walter - but I think it was all a faade.

The scene in the elevator was intense and even a bit sad. It said so much without too many words being spoken. And the ending was nice, but it was predictable and I kept hoping it wouldn't be - the last words Wesley spoke would have meant more if hadn't been.

Tyler Perry has appeared in many of his films, but his role in Good Deeds stands out above all the rest. He did a good job as Wesley Deeds. I enjoyed the movie.

Wesley ""Deeds""was raised to please. To be ""Good"" by everyone else's standards. Hence the film's name: Good Deeds. Fate steps in and through his interactions with Lindsey, his eyes open.

This is essentially a film about two people from different worlds coming together and helping each other realize a new reality, as a result of their varied perspectives on life.

It's a beautifully written script, and exceptional finished product.",1339977600,,555,5.076923076923077

I also thought they could've did a little bit more on the brother's character, I didn't like how that played out but it still was a good flick.",1339977600,7,410,4.074074074074074

4750164,5,B005LAIH1S,"i love this film because it shows the realistic shortcomings of affluent western culture. Perry's role represents what this society has regarded as success-education,money and prominence. gabrielle union's character represenrs what has happened to so many american women (ala lndsy lhn etc.} life to them is self indulgence, money ,materialism and one big party with no desire for children and the dedicated joys of motherhood.rashad's character sees tyler as a success and favored son due to shallow values only.thandie newton's character is reality-in that many try very hard in life and never get the breaks to ease lifes stresses. perry has one excellent trait -that of compassion and empathy.as he views thandies depressed life he also sees a person with values and appreciation of kindness and a protective and loving mother.my favorite scene in the film is when she asks deeds how much is a gallon of milk. this brings him to reality and makes him re-evaluate life.his character is what makes him a success not him money,education or prominence. ireally enjoyed whites character because he represents the failures in parenting, a basically  good son ,never nutured by a mom who showed favoritism to the achieving prominent son over the son who needed emotional support and constantly succumbed to her abusive criticism.  as a caucasion male i tend to prefer black film-makers over whites because white cinema shows life how they want it to be in most film while black directors tend to show the reality of life.  see this film.",1339459200,28,1534,5.103585657370518
4750165,5,B005LAIH1S,"TYLER WENT OUTSIDE THE BOX AND GAVE US SOMETHING WE WEREN'T LOOKING FOR! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, GO BUY IT. IT'S WORTH IT!!",1339372800,,131,4.28
4750166,3,B005LAIH1S,"Let's just start out flat and say that Tyler Perry is definitely not a dramatic actor and will never win an award.  Hell, Will Smith has him beat on acting!  With that said, Perry needs to do what George Lucas should have done for Attack of the Clones - hire a DIRECTOR!

From what I have read and heard from actors, Tyler Perry is cheap and pays them practically nothing!  It is clear that he prefers to keep as much money from his films as much as possible which is why he writes, directs and produces all of them and even stars in them - all so that he gets most of the money!  Yeah, he employs actors who otherwise would not have much higher profile work coming in or who otherwise would not get any TV or film work, but with him it is like getting below or minimum wage!  That should end for a guy with an EGO like Perry!

Now, this film is another one of his hastily put together, predictable films.  This film serves as a showcase for Perry to show off his real life wealth put in film.  He is rich, owns a company, has a nice looking fiance, nice looking mother, fly rides, fly home, is intelligent, cannot relate to the common man and of course, has the ladies fighting over him.  In other words, he is the top man!  He meets a janitor played by another one of Perry's stable of actors (she is just getting by on the acting skills - but she is cute!), but of course in real life, a woman looking like this would never be stuck with a job of janitor!  She would most certainly be someone's assistant some place!

It's the usual story.  Rich man is rich, meets the poor, wants to help, the poor changes his worldly views, he has fun and resigns from his stiff life (that 99% of people would love to have!) and is a better and happier man.  Hell, even his fiance is fine with his new decisions!  Perry is a rotten actor and the guy who played his brother is even worse!  In one dramatic scene, I was expecting more emotions out of Perry.  If he would have had a director, he would have gotten it out of him, but when you are the boss, you can do it half ""A.""

Again, these are not Academy Award type films from Perry, just meant for quick money grabs.  Even though this flopped, it still made money and he has another Medea film lined up right after.  Medea is the anchor and Good Deeds is the experiment.  It would not hurt to get a co-writer to polish the film up and to get rid of cliches and predictable story lines.  In the first 40 minutes, I did not know where it was going, but I knew the ending.  After 40 minutes, it was predictable as was the ending.  In fact, when it ended, I could not believe that it was over with that ending!

It had my attention, but after it was over, it did not have my retention!  This is another ego-driven film by the latest flavor of black directors.  I guess the John Singleton's and Spike Lee's are not the order of today since they tackle real issues and Perry deals with largely foolishness.  It is OK to laugh (although he needs a write for that too, because I don't laugh at his films, I am just entertained) and Perry does deliver positive messages, so I am not as hard on him as others.  My main issues are with the quality.

EXTRA:  I also noticed that Tyler Perry almost always has a mixed girl as the lead and as an example of optimum beauty.  I hope he is not color struck.  He also has a lot of the women in his films as prostitutes as if most black women do that if they are not a professional.",1339113600,6,3454,4.136636636636637

Was it cliche at times? Yes. Did the movie make me laugh? Yes. Did it make me cry? Yes. Did I leave the theater telling myself I would watch it again? Yes. Will I continue to watch movies by Tyler Perry? YES.

 Without going into the plot of the movie,one thing you can be sure of is the entertainment factor. Good Deeds entertains. It has its laugh out loud moments and the sniff your hankie moments as well. If you didn't see it in the theater, make sure you get the dvd to enjoy over and over again. I am.

Phylicia Rashad...at a play in Atlanta I was close enough to reach out and touch her face.  The woman has so much class.
Gabrielle a very fine actress.
Thandie is just gorgeous and played the role well enough
The brother was a bit much, but still believeable.  I've met guys like that, certainly.
