8024674,4,B00029NME0,"I used to own a copy of this film but it was stolen. This purchase was to replace the stolen copy so it passed the test for me of being worth replacing. The story's pretty basic. Boy meets girl but they both have to quit existing relationships before it can work, all set in a heat wave in Buenos Aires. It's done well with lots of well drawn characters like the radio presenter who acts as narrator full of wry comments on what's happening or the best friend who's a a whore and proud of it. Not deep but good entertainment.",1296172800,,525,4.207920792079208
