8051902,1,B0007UQKM0,"Be aware that ONLY HALLMARK currently owns the rights to The Little Rascals & they are releasing them through Lions Gate Home Video. Prior to this, CABIN FEVER had the home video rights. These two companies are the only legitimate releases of The Little Rascals on DVD.

A few Little Rascals have fallen into the Public Domain. GOOD TIMES, DIAMOND & PLATINUM DISC CORP. are some of the companies that have legally released this small group of public domain films to DVD. Their source material may not be as good as the legitimate releases as they do not own the negatives.

However, that Public Domain list is small, a large collection like this (that does not give any titles on the box) most likely contains properties owned by Hallmark.

Also look at your DVD disc, if the recorded side is BLUE you do not have a DVD you have a DVD-R. While DVD-Rs play on most new DVD players, their recording process is different and less stable than regular DVDs. DVD-Rs are expected to have the same short life span as CD-Rs.

Just a word of caution if you plan to purchase non HALLMARK or CABIN FEVER Little Rascals DVDs.",1132272000,8,1112,4.545
