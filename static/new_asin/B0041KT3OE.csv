4245542,3,B0041KT3OE,"This collection is a mediocre grouping of shorts from different seasons.  I expected these shorts to be a lot funnier, similar to The Office tv epsiodes, but these shorts are lacking.  Some moments are funny and entertaining, but it feels like the unfunny moments last longer than the funny moments.  Also, the flow of the episodes could have been better if they had removed the intro bumpers between each 2 minute clip.  The intros add about 10 seconds each and feel unnecessary.

Another review already listed everything that is on the DVD, so I won't list the contents.  I enjoyed Creed's Blackmail short and thought it finally gave his mysterious character more screen time.  Kelly and Erin's video was slightly entertaining.  ""The Accountants"" is not funny, and ""The Loan"" is not funny, except for Darryl's appearance.

Characters in the shorts: Oscar, Angela, Kevin, Creed, Kelly, Ryan, Andy, Erin, Gabe, Toby.  However, Michael Scott, Jim, and Pam are not in any of the shorts.  Dwight Schrute makes an appearance for 2 minutes and his appearance is funny.  I don't think this collection is worth the fifteen or ten.  Only die-hard fans on The Office should get this, but everyone else should just watch the shorts online.  I expected the shorts to be a lot funnier.",1291248000,3,1273,4.88785046728972
4245543,2,B0041KT3OE,"This mainly flesh out the minor characters from the start of the series. Some of the jokes are great, some are a waste. If you're obsessed with the office, you might appreciate it; but I personally don't think its worth the money. These should ahave been extras on the regular season dvds. Last thing, its pretty annoying how they couldn't just edit the clips that make up the shorts to a solid single playing figurette. instead, every few minutes you have to sit through the little opening for the storyline over and over again",1290988800,21,528,4.627659574468085
4245544,2,B0041KT3OE,"So here we have a new ""The Office"" product, and I got it, not really knowing what to expect.  There surely isn't a whole lot of information out there as to what this exactly is supposed to be.  I look at it like a bridge between the Michael Scott era, and the upcoming non-Michael Scott era version of the show (he barely appears in any of the shorts, maybe this is to flesh out some of the minor characters who will become more important next season?).  It's a bunch of 7 minute long excerpts that look like ideas the producers had that just never made it into the show because there wasn't enough to make a whole episode on.

The problem with this disc is simple - you have a good 90% of this content already if you own the season DVDs.  There are a few things on here that I didn't recognize as having seen already, but for the most part, almost the entire content of this disc, special features included, can already be found by hunting through Seasons 3-6 in the bonus content area.  I'm going to assume that I either forgot about the rest, or they'll be some of the bonus features on Season 7.

Is it good material?  Yeah, it's pretty watchable, and having it all in one place is great, but like I said, this is kind of like buying a greatest hits album of a band who's entire discography you already have, so the value of it is questionable.  None of these shorts are as good as your average Office episode, but they're funny nonetheless.  Video quality, etc is not much different than the originals I saw on the seasons.

I'd skip it if I were you, if only because you should spend your money on the seasons instead, if you don't already have them.",1290297600,153,1656,4.292604501607717
4245545,5,B0041KT3OE,"Hello. As this is my first posting ever on Amazon, I wanted to just list all the features of the DVD as there was no description on Amazon's page.

4245604,5,B0041KT3OE,"Totally worth it for any hardcore Office fans.

A lot of the content on this DVD is already on the other DVDs, but Season 9's lack of commentaries made me hungry for more, and this DVD has two bonus commentaries not on any other DVDs.

I also think the webisode Blackmail is exclusive to this DVD, but I'm not sure.

Another happy surprise about this DVD is that it auto-plays all the parts of a webisode, unlike on the other DVDs, a feature I had always wanted. Since they're so short, it's nice to have them just all play at once.",1415491200,,532,4.247524752475248

4245607,4,B0041KT3OE,Great dvd for fanatic. Basically just deleted scenes but were pretty funny. I would recommend buying it if you find it for about 2-3 dollars including shiiping. lol,1395014400,,164,4.892857142857143
4245608,1,B0041KT3OE,"This set is totally overpriced!  They aren't even full episodes, some of them are only 9 minutes long, add the constant looooogggg interuptions for credits, which are extremely annoying and you have less than a full length MOVIE.  And they aren't even funny.  I am a HUGE Office fan, but these were just DUMB with a couple of funny moments here and there.

THe video even interested me in a few episodes that I had not watched before. The song may also help when you are playing Call of Duty but that is questionable at best.",1316217600,,335,4.1692307692307695

I am a big fan of the office and all of their PSA shorts on YouTube, but this just Dwight Schrute Music Video isn't as much fun.  No special clips were included in the Dwight Schrute Music Video.  This was just a rehash of some Dwight moments (from the first few seasons only).  The music wasn't really laugh out loud funny.  After it was finished, I thought I downloaded Amazon's Unbox and downloaded this??  Thank goodness I didn't pay $2 for it.

Edit on 5/23/13: I want to clarify that this review is ONLY for the Dwight Schrute Music Video.  The Office itself is a 5-star series.  Loved it all until the end.  I have purchased the DVD sets and loved the actor interviews online.",1314748800,,771,4.442857142857143

Not funny, not clever, not squirmy cause it makes you so uncomfortable you want to die as you watch it...just blah and boring, words I thought I would never use in describing any episode of The Office; not money well spent.",1314057600,2,379,4.656716417910448

4245647,4,B0041KT3OE,"This is a great collection of The Office digital shorts. What people may not realize is that you can find all of the main content (and most of the bonus features) online at NBC's website. All of the main content originated as web-only shorts that the cast made when they weren't making actual TV episodes. This usually means that the production value isn't up to that of a real episode (not a full cast, shoe-string budget, etc), however, this isn't too apparent and most are still high quality.

If you are an Office fan, like myself, it is definitely worth it to have it as part of your collection.

You can get most (if not all) of the content on this DVD on NBC's website for free. However, if you have slow internet and can't watch video online, you'll want to pick this up. Even if you do have fast internet, it's nice to have all these great shorts in one place backed up off-line.",1298246400,6,888,4.375757575757576
