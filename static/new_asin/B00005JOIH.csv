1538875,3,B00005JOIH,"Munich is almost boring.  This movie drags and is far too long.  Steven Spielberg allowed his left wing ideology get in the way of the story.  He seemingly wanted to make sure that we left the theater believing that both sides are equally guilty in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  Radical leftist Tony Kushner, who believes that Israel should have never came into existence, wrote the screen play.  Both gentlemen obviously perceive the Palestinians as alleged victims of Israeli imperialism.  The murders which took place during the Olympic games in 1972 are therefore somewhat understandable.

The very first thing you must remember about Munich is that it is not even remotely true.  Israel did indeed send assassins to kill the Palestinians responsible for the massacre---but they were not existentially guilt tripped.  None of those who actually participated in this pursuit of justified vengeance resemble the fictional Avner (Eric Bana) and his group of misfits.  We follow the latter throughout Europe and Beirut as they one by one assassinate those on the hit list provided by the Mossad.  There is one peculiar scene when the Israelis and a group of Palestinians spend the night together.  They do not sing Kumbaya.  Still, their interactions supposedly suggest that the world would be a wonderful place if only we learned to communicate better with each other.  Terrorists only need a little love and understanding.  Moreover,  employing violent methods to eradicate terrorism will make things far worse.  The cycle of violence must stop.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.  Violence often accomplishes some wonderful things.  If nothing else, it's how we ended WW II.  Also, please note that regular police officers do not stop arresting criminals merely because crime does not totally disappear.  Is Munich a pacifist film?  No, it's far worse than that: it is an indulgence in nihilism.",1135382400,12,1944,5.180064308681672
1538876,5,B00005JOIH,"The movie Munich is based on an incident that took place during the 1972 in Munich Germany. A Palestenian terrorist group known as Black September captured and held the Israeli

olympic tean hostage. The terrorists and the Israeli olympic team are taken to the airport for a flight out of the country.

A rescue attempt fails and the whole olympic team is killed by

the terrorist group.

  Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir decides to strike back after

the murders of the Israeli olympic team. A special team is chosen

to gain vengeance for the atrocity. A list of 11 terrorists is

drawn up by the government and Mossad to be assassinated. The five man team goes to Europe to begin the hunt. The leader of the team is Avner who is ably played by Eric Bana. One by one the

terrorists who were involved in the planning and implementation of the terrorist attack in Munich are killed by Avner and his team. The Israeli team goes to Greece,France,England and other

European locales in their hunt for the terrorists.

  The team becomes hunted which results in several of the team members being killed. The mental toll on the team members is also shown. Out of the 11 terrorists 9 are killed for vengeance.

  This is a very good movie that you should go see.",1135382400,2,1260,4.57847533632287
1538877,1,B00005JOIH,"Munich the film is as much an atrocity as Munich the terrorist massacre. It creates the impression of a moral equivalence between terrorists who slaughter innocents and those who would punish those same terrorists. It's like saying that-well-the Nazi holocaust was a bad thing, but so is hunting down and punishing the Nazis who perpetrated it. This is a particularly pernicious message in the post 9/11 world and I think a deliberate one. Second, Munich the film is stuffed full of lies. The Israeli assassination team did not spend its time wallowing in self doubt as depicting in the film. As recently as this past spring, the real head of the team stated that he was proud of what he did. He certainly did not behave as he is depicted behaving in the film. Spielberg should certainly recognize evil when he sees it; he did, after all, make Schindler's List. But when confronted with another, more modern evil, he choose to wallow in liberal guilt rather than create a clear eyed depiction of it. Spielberg is, in effect, saying that terrorism is sometime justified and that fighting against it is not. For shame",1135296000,34,1115,4.782383419689119
1538878,4,B00005JOIH,"MUNICH is a powder keg.  It is a film that is so steeped in controversy not because of its content, but because of who made it.  The most famous director in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, has crafted a film that is so brave not because of its content but because of its point of view.  This film is about Israel and it's ongoing conflict with the people of Palestine, and it doesn't paint a pretty picture of anyone involved.

In 1972 thousands of athletes and spectators poured into Munich to celebrate and compete in another Olympics.  All was well until 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a terrorist faction called Black September.  All 11 men were killed.  In its aftermath the Israeli government hired five Mosad agents to go undercover and kill the 11 men who were responsible.

The film follows Avner (Eric Banner) the leader of this group on his mission to get revenge for the Munich Olympics. Avner is a regular guy placed in a position that at first seems justifiable.  But as the body count gets higher and he finds himself justifying more and more killings, we the audience are left wondering if the ends really do justify the means.  Were the Black September terrorists really evil and uncaring or were they men without voices trying to make somebody listen?  Is revenge really the best weapon?  Does killing those responsible end the real violence? MUNICH poses questions and leaves the audience to sort out the answers.

MUNICH is not a film about the battle between good and evil.  It's a film about evil fighting an  even worse evil.  It's about human futility and about how vengeance doesn't solve a problem it only makes it worse.  It's about corrupt Nationalism and corrupt ideals  that turn good people into monsters and the corrupt governments that penalize the monsters they've created.  But at the heart its about the regular guys who are fighting turf wars with regular guys and how given the right circumstances we all have the potential to do evil masquerading as good.

And yet trying to nail down the intentions of Munich is quite difficult.  You certainly can't cheer Avner.  He's no hero, but you also can't fault him for his outrage.  His countrymen were killed senselessly, why shouldn't his people retaliate?  Why shouldn't the terrorists pay for their sins?

The major flaw and yet its strongest attribute it that it fails to take a side.  It fails to define just what evil is.  It allows the audience to watch from a distance and doesn't attempt to drown the audience in political correctness.  But can these warring factions both be right?  Is there ever an end?  Where does America fit into the story?  Does America's support of the state of Israel make us culpable?  The film shies away from those answers (except in the final shot that speaks far more than any in this film).  Is that a good thing? I don't really know, what I do know is that this is the kind of film that will put people on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict on the defensive.  If you think strongly one way or the other MUNICH will anger you.

I applaud Spielberg for the brave choice of choosing an Israeli as the focal point of the story.  If this had been about the Palestinians it would have been so easy (at least for me) to accept the Arab people as the villain and the Jewish people as victims.  But at the end aren't both sides Victim's of each others misguided Nationalism? It's easy to paint terrorists as the evil party.  But good and evil are never black and white and sometimes bad things happen on both sides.  But revenge never gets us anywhere, and Munich shows us characters that are so normal becoming Monsters.  They may be justified in their anger but are not helping the situation.  This is a bold position to take.

MUNICH is not a black and white film and it should be dissected.  IT should be discussed and it should be a lesson to those who see the issues of Israel's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger.  The ongoing tensions in the middle east will not be solved by American guns but by the people of the middle east putting down the guns and asking for forgiveness from each other.  Would that ever happen?  Will the fighting ever end?  Not until someone can fix the darkness in every human heart.

Post-script: After writing this review I must say that the film MUNICH is inspired by actual events and that my comment are not meant to be skewed either right or left.  The current problems in the Middle East are numerous and complicated and I myself only know very little.  The above review are my thoughts after viewing the film MUNICH and not on the people of ISRAEL and/or PALESTINE.  I believe they both have a right to exist and be defended, and I pray for peace in that region.",1135296000,10,4862,4.556581986143187

1539122,2,B00005JOIH,"I watched this movie immediately after reading the superb book upon which it was based, ""Vengeance.""  The movie was very disappointing, by dint of being slow-paced, disjointed, and poor character development. Maybe it's impossible for the excellent book to ever receive adequate movie treatment, but for sure this movie did not capture fully the against-all-odds reality facing their little band of Israeli agents, nor the feeling within the band of overwhelming expectations placed upon their shoulders.  And the movie did a poor job of conveying the way in which the main character, Avner, was callously treated and discarded by the Mossad at the end.  Most absurd was the scene near the end of the movie, where scenes of the final moments of the Israeli athletes' murders by the terrorists were interspersed with Eric Bana (playing the main hero, Avner) screwing his wife, with a mounting look of anguish and despair on his face as he banged away and came to a climax; I mean, I didn't get what Spielberg was trying to convey with such a weird scene, mixing eroticism with a climatic scene of murderous terrorism.  It bordered on comedic.",1503273600,,1141,4.958115183246074

As an ethical argument, it is haunting. The Movie conveys the toll which the inordinate tension of their job and the mechanics of their methods take on its subjects.

1539654,1,B00005JOIH,"Speilberg has made a career out of distorting history and misleading the public.  This film is in accord with SCHINDLER'S LIST and LINCOLN for it's false depiction of events and motives.  The real Israeli assassination team which retaliated for the Munich event in 1972 killed a Moroccan waiter in Lilihamer, Norway, when they stupidly mistook him for one of the targets on their list.  After that notorious event the operation was called off, and then this Israeli George Jonas published his book where he claimed that he was plucked out of the Israeli Army to lead a team of assassins in this matter.  If he in fact had done this and published a book about it Mossad would have bundled him off to Israel and he would have been sent to prison for violation of his security oath.  That is the reality, which has nothing to do with this fantasy depiction in which Israeli assassins are ambivolent and their conscious torn for what they are doing.  In terms of tradecraft and operations little in this story rings true.  Teams are not sent out independently, on their own, with not even a clue as to how to find their targets.  Nor are teams led by anyone as inexperienced as the ""Avner"" depicted.  In reality Israeli assassins are experienced and remorseless killers who do not grieve for their targets or have an problems with their conscious.  What's interesting about Israeli assassination teams in particular is their notorious incompetence.  In the Munich affair they killed an innocent waiter in Lilihamer.  Recently their entire team was caught on CCTV killing someone in a hotel in Dubai, and all their passport pictures are now all over Youtube and the internet.  And their are scores of other such cases of Israeli carelessness and incompetence in this area.  It's likely that Jonas was involved in these matters however, although he penned this false account to mislead the public about many aspects of it.  One interesting event that rings true is an encounter with American CIA officers who are protecting a Palestinian Arab terrorist the Israeli's are trying to kill.  The CIA officers not only thwart the Israeli's efforts and protect the terrorist, but according to this story CIA had formed an alliance of sorts with these terrorists in exchange for leaving Americans alone.  Evidently this much is true, and only recently was brought to light in the reversal of the conviction of alleged rogue CIA officer Edwin Wilson.  CIA officers Wilson and Frank Terpel were tasked by CIA after Munich to form alliances with these terrorist groups.  The fact that Jonas knew this and included it in his narrative indicates that he access to some accurate information.  I conclude the story includes information the Israeli government wants to public to know, and omits other information they don't want known, and otherwise give a misleading picture of just about everything.",1451001600,2,2880,4.935684647302905

This is an interesting movie regarding the inner values and concerns of real-life assassins. What they think about, what they consider. I don't know how accurate all of that was in real life, but the situations are believable and the events are telling.

Yet what struck me most of all was the awful penalty imposed on people who gave themselves over to VENGEANCE, (which is exactly what all of this is.) You take revenge into your own hands and you open yourself up to all sorts of reprisals and loss of morals, purpose, hope, and personal safety. That's a real bad place to be, as this movie shows to great effect.

Some men lose sleep, some men lose their minds, some men lose their lives others lose nothing and some lose their soul. Was it all worth it?

This is the third movie made about the mossad going after the Munich Olympic terrorists. Amazon has a free (for Prime) film, The Sword of Gideon, which--although made for TV--is more entertaining than this boring tripe. I mean, Speilberg directs well, and some of the photography and editing is first rate, but it is based on a muddy and incomprehensible screenplay. I bought this thing, and stopped watching it about 15 minutes before the end. What does that tell you about the quality?

These people (not all Muslims, of course) are a threat to the civilized world.  Israel was right to go after members of Black September.  They are right to go after terrorists in Gaza.  It is a matter of survival.  Fast forward to 2015 and look at the weak support Obama and Kerry offer Israel.  These people are our friends, not Hamas.

... if you've seen any of Spielberg's other films on big subjects, you'll know what his worst sin is. In War of the Worlds, he turned a Martian invasion into an exercise in parental bonding between Tom Cruise and his alienated son and whiney daughter. As I wrote at the time, ""Spielberg seems to be reversing the priorities of Casablanca: this crazy world don't amount to a hill of beans next to the problems of three little people."" The reductio ad absurdum of this approach, you'll recall, is that Tom Hanks pep talk to his men about how, in years to come when they look back on the war, they'll see that ""maybe saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we managed to pull out of this whole godawful mess"". Good to know defeating the Third Reich wasn't a complete waste of time then. Spielberg's limitation as a film-maker is his inability to overcome this ludicrous boomer narcissism. He's utterly incapable of understanding that there are tides in the affairs of men when your levels of self-esteem are less important than just getting on with it. He's lost the big picture  there's just you and your feelings and even in the midst of a critical national mission you can sit around obsessing about your self-doubt as if it's some gabby chick flick.

Obviously that sucks, no one should be murdered for something their countrymen do.  But this movie only focuses on the ""revenge"" the Mossad (an Israeli terrorist organization, oh, oops, did I say terrorist organization?

Ignores the fact that the Palestinian act of terrorism (and killing uninvolved civilians IS terrorism, no matter what anyone on either side of it says) was also revenge for Zionist acts of terrorism and GENOCIDE against Palestine.  So basically we have Spielberg showing a one sided account of a sordid chapter in a war where there are no good guys.  So basically it's just a long, drawn out Zionist propaganda piece.

Spielberg even went so far as to throw in as much female nudity as possible without raising any eyebrows.  Classy.  Nothing like a little sex to compliment politically motivated violence.

1540166,4,B00005JOIH,"As a thriller it doesn't thrill, but as an examination of ethics and conscience it is very good.

When Avner [ Bana] is hand picked by Golda Meier to hunt down the Palestinian masterminds behind the 1972 killing of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, he undertakes his mission enthusiastically though it will mean leaving his lovely young wife and baby behind for perhaps years. Of course, everything is off record and independent of Mossad, though he will be bankrolled and reporting to an intermediary.

With his team and a quirky French contact who supplies information about the locations of the Palestinians, he tracks them down one by one, eventually realizing it is not that easy to kill human beings-and even more shockingly that he has been sent to eliminate the Palestinian leadership --who were not necessarily involved in the Munich affair.

Fantastic recreations of the 1970's in European settings, and a marvelous accidental confrontation with Palestinian  guerrillas which leads Avner to question some of his most cherished suppositions make this a mature Spielberg production-though  not quite in the same league as Schindler's List.

This is an action thriller. It is not a political film that one may would have expected particularly since this happened in real life. The screenplay is built on a premise and a revenge plot for the innocent people that got killed and go after the bad guys that got away with it. It merely uses the Israeli- Palestinian conflict on the background and the film refuses to go into depth into the subject matter for it was centered more about seeking revenge and the price the criminals have to pay for the despicable acts that they have committed.

Otherwise, they make no sense (like the scene where they use the hand-pump guns to kill the Dutch woman. Why didn't they just use handguns? In the original version, there's actually a reason. In this version, it's just silly).

The dialogue is forced, it's choppy, makes no sense and tries to constantly hammer the same political point. Normal people don't speak like that. The original version is much more subtle, and explains why the characters are so conflicted over what they do. Here, there's no conflict. It's just a bunch of bad acting.

there are moments in the cafe where you really do want to get your card bunched and buy a cd.
i mean,  i LOVE the art direction in this film so much that i want to have 70s stuff im my house again
and i hated the 70s when they were here.  polyester and faux back to the land color schemes.  but
from this distance, in this film its very pleasant.
i have mixed feelings about the mixed feelings of the characters.  the murder of people on city streets
and the celebration of the murders is reprehensible.  the fact that the assassins loose their way as time
goes by does not make me feel sorry for them.  if i reverse the rolls and make them all arabs kililng isralis
then i am not very happy about them dancing to smokey robinson after a kill. I did like all the characters
as far as the acting went,  except for the palestinians who oddly seemed to have quirky accents ...

the best part is the raw sexuality of the actress who is the wife... and i admit i did not write her name down
for this review.  but her sweet face and easy manner made her very appealing.  I wanted to be married
to her, too.  I wonder if she is still in Brooklyn.  Do you think she put on much weight?  Do you think
she has better food than Israel back then?  kosher everywhere,  boiled beef and no herbs.

all kidding aside, the constant flash back to the murder was poor technique and lousy film making,  i am
so over it by the time we see the whole thing.  What was the point of that?  I think it hurt the story and
i cannot really understand its use as a device here.  it was very very creepy using it to tell the sexual
part of his personal loss ..  how the mission had hurt him.  but i do watch this film every now and then,
skipping over the repeats of the break in...  for i don't like to watch murder,  and also i don't like to
watch the same scenes repeated again and again...  there must have been more to tell than that.

the choice to show the brutal murder of the beautiful Dutch killer was,  I think,  a good one.  it is overwhelming,
as it should be.  murder probably looks alot like that.  the stunned victim does not drop,  but
walks over pets her cat.  its heart breaking and unforgettable.  Does it serve to show how horrible,  how personal vilence is?
yes I think it did.  but maybe kids under twelve should never see this film at all,  for real.  i don't watch that part either.",1394755200,2,2483,4.1257861635220126

Hes part of a team of four and had to sacrifice being in contact with his pregnant wife in order to be on this mission. He choose to do this because of his strong ties to Israel: his father was a hero for the country and he was raised in an orphanage ran by the state so he is very patriotic and feels that he owes them.

1540490,5,B00005JOIH,"I watched this movie years ago, and know that it is loosely based on events that happened after the Munich killings.  Having said that, Spielberg is a movie producer, not a historian.  He doesn't claim that this is factual and it's based on a book.

To the critics of the movie for supposed political implications, I think you are taking some of the events or dialog in the movie and turning into something it is not.  People have a right to question their actions.  Murdering people, after all, I hope would scar anyone, even if for reasons they feel is justifiable.  And that's the dialog.  But this theme is not constant through the movie, and at the beginning when they get their first kill they are all celebrating. So this theme of questioning their actions and comparing it to what the terrorist did hardly shows up at all in the movie, so I don't feel it was important to Spielberg as much as it was to show that people have inner conflict about continually going around in a secretive way and killing people.

The movie follows a team of assassins as they track down members of the terrorist group that was involved with the Munich killings.  They are not SEAL team trained, then CIA trained, assassins.  They are what Israel decides is a team that can blend into European society and carry out a mission with enough skill to get the job done and not get caught.

To me the movie seems plausible and the characters seem plausible and that's all that matters to me when watching a historical fiction movie.  The movie is suspenseful, dramatic and in my opinion very well acted.

And to those who doubt there would be friction between assassins and their govt. officials, well, OK you have your right to think as you may. I can easily see why a govt would want those assassins to be very much under their control, or dead.",1375488000,,1829,4.522796352583587

1540524,4,B00005JOIH,"(SPOILERS)

About the film, Munich, I was confounded by some of the ideologies, terrified by the expressed potentialities and convinced that those drunken 'Mericans were intended to represent CIA interlopers.

Like the rest of mankind, I have a limited knowledge of actual events. Only historically and then only after some of the filters have fallen away, might we know what these individuals and governments were up to, went through, and to what degree/end they succeeded/failed. For political action films, my initial attentions focus on the realities of physical events (devices, vehicles, locations) and the acting (characters, dialogue) not my perception of the truth at the time I am viewing.

Only recently have I learned to withstand my own predisposition to believe that ""...based on actual events."" means anything. Unless it is a first hand, objective accounting of a single perspective backed up by unedited documentation - it is fiction.  To call it ""a memoir"" or ""based on a true story"" is just a disclaimer. Here is the simplest truth: someone fabricated a storyline and wrote it down.

Many reviews decried the freelance killing of the Dutch houseboat woman. While brutal, it is among the most realistic death scenes, ever. The subtlety of her reaction to having been shot, the manner in which she made a semi-conscious rationalization to leave the room, then defaulted to a familiar action (approaching the cat) the decreasing abilities to function that resulting in her with finalit, but as though she was only short on alternatives, visit a necessary chair. It was a wonderful scene, acting-wise. And yes it was horrific. One thing I noticed is the number of comments about the shooters ""reloading,"" them ""shooting her again"" and then leaving her exposed. Unless there are several cuts, I saw a third man perform the ""coup de gras"" and then after one of the original shooters closed her robe, the third man brazenly uncovered her again and said, ""leave it..."" or to that effect. All the whining about nudity, grace, fairness and decency fails to sway my opinion that it was very well acted.

This film and those like it are about reality; bad people in a grossly mismanaged geopolitical world. (Wake up! Yes, it's a mess, and no, I couldn't do better at picking up after their droppings.) Those whose sensitivities are disturbed by the violence of political drama must to take some responsibility. Either do a little more research into what you choose to watch, or stop complaining about how the big mean world is being depicted. On the other hand - one might stick with fantasy...For instance, 1950's musicals or U.S. prime-time network television...the truly mindless stuff of life.",1369353600,2,2703,5.04932735426009

He tries to portray them as just politicos with a cause - albeit one that tries to overthrow the state of Israel through ruthless and mindless terrorism! (1 star rating deducted for this point.)

I've giving an above average 4 star rating for this movie because it has non-stop action and satisfying wide-angle graphics. I like action movies with a message.

This movie is action packed from start to finish and shows the seemingly endless cycle of violence in Middle Eastern politics. The Mossad's actions were thoroughly justified in reaction the injustices that the underdog, Israel, faces. With the rise of evil Liberalism, Germany had swung from one extreme to another, from Nazism in the 1930s and 1940s to a paralyzed, Liberal state without a proper anti-terror force in the year 1972. When Germany couldn't and and wouldn't save those innocent Israeli athletes, Israel had no choice but to do its rightful part in avenging their deaths. This movie takes a peek at how Israel defends herself beyond her borders.

If you want to see how brave Mossad operatives hunt down and take out those who murder innocent Israeli civilians, buy and watch this movie, then go join Mossad and Shin Bet (Israel's version of the MI5)! But, don't join if you're going to be doubtful and hesitant in your work.

I also want to take this space to thank all those earlier reviewers who recommended ""Sword of Gideon""! Both movies reminiscing the Israeli response will go into my library collection!

1540634,4,B00005JOIH,"For a film that could have stood more editing, ""Munich"" holds one spellbound. Jewish Spielberg doesn't take sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict but shows the continual output given long-standing trends - violence begets violence.
 While that remains a constant, shifting international winds make long-term field operations dicey and often counterproductive. Those that have watched Daniel Craig's movies out of sequence might wonder how James Bond got on the Israeli hit squad. The incomparable Geoffrey Rush (""The King's Speech"") is worth his weight in gold in this film.
 I happened to see ""Munich"" the same weekend that presidential aspirant Newt Gingrich popped off about the Palestinians being a ""made-up people."" Golda Meir, Israeli prime minister during the 1972 Olympics crisis and included in ""Munich,"" once said the same thing. Spielberg reminds us that Palestinian aspirations are genuine and earnest people are willing to die for them. The Palestinians are not part of some anti-Jewish plot hatched by the Islamic world against the U.S. and its allies as Gingrich and his neocon/Israel Lobby pals would like people to believe.
Nationalist flag-wavers are not capable to grasping the Jewish/Arab tragedy.  But Spielberg, honest broker/filmmaker, understands it. Only when flags are set aside and brotherhood and forgiveness come front and center will peace endure.",1324944000,,1381,5.566666666666666

1540636,4,B00005JOIH,"In 1972, during the summer Olympics in Munich, Germany Palestinian terrorists killed 2 members of the Israeli wrestling team and kidnapped 9 others.  They along with all 9 Olympians were ultimately killed before leaving the country.  Although some of the eventual operation to assassinate those responsible remains secret, much is known as well.  Based on George Jonas' novel ""Vengeance"", director Steven Spielberg fills in the gaps with this excellent thriller.  Eric Bana gives a powerful performance as the leader of a 5 man operation assigned the task of killing the leaders responsible for the attack.  The group surprisingly is not an elite unit in the usual sense.  Avner (Bana) is a mid level Mossad agent but had worked as a body guard for Prime Minister Golda Meir.  The other 4 are similarly a bit out of their element.  Although the film clearly separates the good guys from the bad guys, Spielberg still manages to make each character sympathetic in some way.  Avner and others in the group confront moral choices.  Is this murder or justice?  The film has a top notch cast including Geoffrey Rush as the Unit's government contact, Daniel Craig as the driver and the Unit tough guy.  Mathieu Amalric is especially effective as the French connection that helps with locations and logistics.  The film focus however is on Avner and begins to meanders a bit as his episodes of depression result in flashbacks to the original terrorist attack.  I guess that keeps him and us centered on why the mission is necessary.  Overall this is a fine political thriller based on real events.",1314748800,,1590,4.924812030075188

the Palestinians were all authentic historical figures but the 5 Israeli agent squad was fictitious...

the first part of the movie was really good with accurate representation of history...the terrorists broke into Olympic Village and killed unarmed Israeli athletes.

in the second half of the movie, Spielberg went into his personal journey, asking whether Israel's counter terror effort is justifiable and lamented it did not stop terrorism...Spielberg could have done so much more with this material yet he chose to do a spin on his liberal moral code of conduct.  A lot of the material covered in this movie deserves great deal of exploration but this movie totally failed.

1540638,5,B00005JOIH,"`Munich' (2006) is a powerful, intense, sobering and complex examination into the unseen world of international espionage and political revenge. If you enter into viewing this film with a pre-conceived worldview or mindset that is wired to accept only clearly defined categories such as black and white, right and wrong, good and evil and them and us, fasten your seatbelt and prepare for a paradigm shift.

The film begins with the massacre of the Israeli athletic squad at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany by the PLO and moves on from that heart wrenching historical event to weave a fictional tale of Israel's response through a convert scheme to hunt down and assassinate those responsible. At first it seems self evident as to which side is justified in their endeavor and which side deserve no reprieve from their impending punishment.

However as the web of intrigue deepens, ethics tested and unavoidable compromises made the line between the righteous and the unrighteous slowly begins to blur and ultimately disappear. Matters are further complicated by the discovery of other covert groups, political and non political, with agendas that may hamper the Israeli game plan.

The viewer will have much to consider by the end of the film. All the traditional questions such as ""those who live by the sword, die by the sword', or ""violence begets violence"" come to mind as well as new ones that maybe you haven't considered. Emotionally and mentally drained by the time the credits roll by one is ultimately one is left to wonder if there is any answer to the eternal cycle of hatred and violence at all.",1310083200,,1619,4.923076923076923

1540689,5,B00005JOIH,"First of all, this film doesn't explain the motivations of the Black Septembrists,but it shows in 3 or 4 stages through flashback the unfolding events neatly interposed in the narrative of the aftermath. However this is no mere action thriller,it interjects arguments,dialogue for and against Israeli or Palestinian,or the supposed righteousness of the cause together with the moral ambivalence of revenge,the toll the assassinations take on the team of killers as they mount up, as their humanity is put through the ringer of state anti-terrorism. The whole issue of `homeland' and `homelessness',the seizure of land by dispossessing a whole people and claiming you have law on your side,because the dispossessed have no laws,no history. The Jews in this film are not shown as the `Chosen People',with no claim to moral superiority.

They are bloodied and bowed,shown to be imitating and copying the amorality of terrorism,having no idealism, reactionary,becoming criminals themselves. Spielburg takes us through a list of suspects given to Avner(Banna) by his Mossad case-worker Ephraim(Rush,excellent) and shows the team setting up in various cities,Rome, Paris,London, in Cyprus,in Spain,in Holland,Athens,after intel given them by source Louis(Amalric) and picking them off by bomb and bullet. Spielburg cleverly reconstructs the clothes,vehicles,d&eacute;cor,look of the 70s and the music,and lets us hear and see the full impact of a bomb blast,together with the things that can go wrong and the collateral damage of an exploded bomb. There is dramatic license with the facts,he gives us a team of only 5 men,in truth there were many teams. This is no documentary or historical reconstruction,although it's loosely based on Vengeance by Jonas and scripted by Krushner,it captures through empathy,intensity,wit,humour and imagination a sense of a world unravelling through blood begetting more blood,a loss of moral certainty and direction through time,and for Avner a loss of trust in the Israeli project and the people he works for,his increasing paranoia and desire to live as a `homeless Jew' outside of Israel with his wife and new child.

Spielburg has utilised all his formidable knowledge as a film maker and a Jew himself to courageously show an honest portrayal of a difficult subject that he got a lot of flak for. He has out-Germaned the German new film makers in deconstructing his own cultural norms,bringing scepticism to bear on the course of post-Munich Israel. The acting in the film by Eric Bana,Daniel Craig,Ciaran Hinds,Geoffrey Rush,Matthieu Amalric,Matthieu Kassowitz,Hans Zitschler,Lyn Cohen(Golda Meir) is superb. The cinematography is suitably washed out. Although the film is long, its sharply paced and tensely riveting. I still was surprised at Spielburg's tackling the European milieu with such a cosmopolitan style,cool,classy and urbane, and his echoing America since 9/11, negotiating ""compromises with its own values"" through drawing parallels by ending on the Twin Towers,still then standing. The film pays rewatching to get its full flavour and many details.",1278979200,,3100,5.565677966101695

While the ending was cinematically fitting and suitable, it left you hanging as to the outcome of its main character.

1540694,5,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" (2005) is a powerful, well-acted, very suspenseful film by Steven Spielberg about retribution and the stressful toll it can exact on those practicing it. In 1972 at the Munich Olympics eleven Israeli athletes were brutally slaughtered by eight Palestinian terrorists. Israel in retaliation began a campaign to hunt down and kill the eleven people who were believed to have planned the attack. As a result of the Israeli plan hundreds may have died in retaliatory actions.
In the final scenes of the movie two characters are talking, and in the background can be seen standing proudly the World Trade Center before the horrific attack of September 11, 2001. After that event the United States began a campaign of retribution that caused the deaths of thousands, and as of yet the masterminds of the attack have not been found or punished.
The movie deals with the grim realities of the Munich tragedy and its aftermath. Golda Meier, the Israeli prime minister, selects one man, Avner (actor Eric Bana) to head a five man team to kill the responsible parties. The movie painstakingly traces the team's attempts to kill off the planners. Each member of the team comes across as a real person, each brave and resourceful. Daniel Craig portrays one of the team members.
Avner is a decent man whose conscience gets to him: he cracks under the stress because of the moral dilemma he's been encased in. He's haunted by the blood bath unleashed in Munich and the retaliation under his leadership.
From the standpoint of being a thriller, this is an extremely well-developed film aside from its moral and political implications. The masterful sense of timing, the cinematography, the characterization, the casting, the narrative velocity, the intensity of the action - all contribute to catch your attention and hold it. The scenes of the hostage-taking and the brutal airport violence, like newsreel footage, are not shown all at once. They come at you at different times in the movie making it a gripping experience.
John Le Carre and Graham Greene in their thrillers almost always dealt with the moral dimension of the situation, and this move is powerful because it is much more than a thriller; it deals with the moral consequences of actions and reactions.",1262044800,3,2261,4.984126984126984

A tragedy that should've translated into a riveting movie just bored me to tears, and my eyes rolled back into my skull so many times I am permanently cross-eyed.

1540696,4,B00005JOIH,"I hadn't previously investigated Munich and its aftermath, so I can't judge the accuracy of this movie.  But that doesn't matter, for three reasons: (a) perhaps no one outside the world of espionage knows what really happened, (b) the movie is self-described as only ""inspired by"" real events, and (c) what matters is the broader message, not the details.

And that broader message is quite obvious, indeed commonplace, if you can rise above a strongly partisan viewpoint.  The message is that when two distinct and clannish groups desperately want the same piece of land as their home, and neither group can eliminate the other, conflict and violence will tend to be perpetuated, resulting in a lose-lose outcome.  At the same time, there's some hope of compromise and peace if each group comes to recognize the faults in its own ideology and actions, appreciates that the other side isn't entirely wrong, and recognizes a shared humanity.  So there are two tensions operating in parallel: (a) between the two groups, and (b) within each group, between making concessions in order to compromise versus continuing to fight (at whatever mutual cost) until the other group has been utterly defeated.  At a more specific level, a related message is that assassinations and terrorism may keep pressure on the other side, but they ultimately only contribute to perpetuating the conflict rather than resolving it.

The movie depicts all of this quite clearly, and thereby does a service in helping us better understand the problem.  At nearly 3 hours, it's quite long, but it kept my attention, so I didn't mind.  As some reviewers have noted (ignore the extremists), it isn't a perfect movie (hence my 4-star rating), but I still recommend it to people who want to better understand why these types of conflicts are so difficult to resolve.

Finally, here's my proposed solution to the problem.  Forget about the current Palestinian territories and instead give the northmost third of Israel to the Palestinians.  Provide the Palestinians with quality infrastructure, fully cover their relocation costs, and provide them with plenty of seed money, all of this paid for by Israel and international aid.  Help the Palestinians establish a credible democratic government with adequate military backing.  Last but not least, place Jerusalem under UN control, with everyone having guaranteed safe access to it, including a dedicated highway from the new Palestine to Jerusalem.  That's all it takes: allow each group to continue to exist, physically seperate the two groups, allow each group to have quality land within the current territory, and throw some money at the problem where needed.  Can we please implement this solution soon, so that everyone can move on to other issues?",1260057600,3,2773,5.142538975501114

1540804,4,B00005JOIH,"It is a well done film and has many aspects of the story that create great suspense, intrigue, and self questioning. My  issues with the film are few but important. For instance, I am disappointed by  the way in which the director creates a tie in at the end between Avner making love to his wife in Brooklyn, and the final bloody shoot out between the PLO hostage terrorists and the German police interjected in between the humping and slobbering.  Eric Bana's character feels guilty and his catharsis from guilt  comes from the semi violent act of making love to his wife??? Quite ridiculous and far fetched in my opinion, and clearly  the only quick and easy way out of the film for the director which is running long 164 minutes, and lacking a clean, happy and realistic ending. With notable exceptions, Spielberg often leans toward unrealistic happy endings. However since he is dealing with a real story, perhaps a real ending could have been more important for the sense of reality that the film attempts to capture. In the end, his own government disappoints him when he questions the policy of going after the terrorists in the same terrorist manner that they have experienced.
One other issue has to do with the story itself. It seems pretty unbelievable that after the French informants have put them in a safe house in Greece with the Palestinian terrorists - and somehow surviving, that Avner and his associates continue to trust the informants despite being set-up by them.
Overall an important film about  story that has received a lot of press but one which has put little scrutiny on the German government and people for the lousy handling of the Munich massacre that reads almost like a ""how not to handle a hostage crisis"". When considering the history of Germany and the jewish people, how can one not point the finger at the German government and police for their ineptitude in creating a shoot out in which no hostages were left alive. Then a few weeks later how quickly the spineless German government chose to extricate themselves from the mess they created in the first pace thru their poor security at the Munich games by deciding to  hand over the 3 remaining captured terrorists to the Libyans in exchange for 12 Germans whose plane was hijacked in the middle east.",1250726400,,2293,4.7462311557788945

Based on the book Vengeance, an Israeli Body Guard to Golda Meir is engaged to assassinate conspirators in the kidnapping and murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  The main character uses many different aliases and travels throughout Europe to kill his targets.  It's an intriguing story and one that was never discredited as the truth.  I found the movie quite interesting but also confusing.  It is difficult to completely understand what is going on but I suspect that the main character and the other Israeli agents also felt that way.  The story is ambiguous in whether the mission helped Israel or harmed the country's long term peace goals.  It also highlights the intractable problem these two groups - israelis and Palestinians have with each other.

1540807,4,B00005JOIH,"I missed ""Munich"" when it was originally released but I recall the reviews at the time.  As I understood it, ""Munich"" was criticized for being too ""soft"" on the Palistinians.  After watching it last night, I understand that criticism somewhat but that isn't my criticism of the film.

I was 20 at the time of the horrible event at the Munich Olympics and I am surprized as to how little I knew about the details.  I discovered how limited my knowledge was when I watched the excellent documentary ""One Day in September"".  That film was electrifying and it was the unanticipated standard that emerged as I was watching ""Munich"".  I was put on guard with the opening note ""Based on an actual event"" (or words to that effect).  What could be more rivitting than the actual events?  Well, not ""Munich"" as it turned out.  I did not play Spielburg's introduction to the film so maybe there was something in that which could have assuaged my concerns.  Nonetheless, I took heart in realizing that this movie would be about the ruthless and systematic search and destruction of the group that plotted the outrageous act.  That went well until I started questioning who, what and WHY was there a family that, for a price, did all the search and location of the enemy participants.  I realized right away that this had to be a fictionalized short cut that denied us the greater appreciation as to how the ""good guys"" were able to locate the ""bad guys"".  I assumed, with disappointment, that it was an effort to save time on the already lengthy script.  It bothered me and I couldn't let it go.  It may have served in a symbolic way although I didn't get a point worthy of its' inclusion.  It did give us a perspective, in time, of the hunters becoming the hunted.

Ultimately, the message I got from ""Munich"" was that violence is its' own reward.  The individual in charge of the actual search and destruction metamorphs into a very troubled individual.  The overall theme that I found is that hate met with revenge reproduces itself endlessly until a new dirrection is introduced.  Tell that to the Israeli's who don't have many options to safely experiment with.  There were elements of world-wide politics that were introduced to the movies and many might have caught some conspiritorial meaning in those allusions.  However, I was immune to that since that French family of missing person brokers convinced me it was all fiction anyway.  If you thought that ""Munich"" was interesting from an historical perspective, be sure and get the better (and more dramatic) reality from ""One Day in September"".",1246752000,,2592,4.749440715883669

This film was inspired by real events which suggests more fiction than based on true events. Young men climb over a fence to get to the Olympic village; are they up to no good? Yes, they are the terrorists who captured Israeli athletes as hostages during the 1972 Olympics in Munich. All eleven athletes were murdered. Will the Israeli government act in revenge? The precedent was the Eichmann abduction. The decision is made. A team will be formed to implement the decision. Will they use experienced agents or new men who won't be known? This is the story about the reprisals taken against the Black September leaders for the eleven dead.

The dinner introduces the men on the team. Avner wants to find the location of some men. [James Madisons picture was on the $5,000 bill, the largest in circulation then.] The first target is a man who does translations. The operation had costs. The TV shows the news. Another target is selected. What did they do to that telephone? The next time they plan a new method for night-time. Will this team go to Beirut? What kind of disguise will they use to attack their new target? There is a strange meeting in the country. [This pads the film.] They find a safe house in Athens with mattresses on the floor. Was there a mix-up? Or a dramatic device? There is a foul-up. The next target is in London. Will there be a mistake?

Did Carl trust the wrong person? Is it time for them to move out? They visit a houseboat. Those who were eliminated are just replaced by worse men. One of their team was found on a park bench. They must be more careful now. One man wasnt. There is another failure. Avner returns as if nothing happened. What did you learn? Was there a betrayal? What will he do next? Is he being hunted? Was the ending meant to be ironic? Does killing affect the killers psychologically? No therapy mentioned in this story.

There was a scandal when a Palestinian waiter in Sweden was assassinated because he resembled his cousin, who was on the Israeli target list. This is an example of the problem of sanctioned killing: there is no attempt at any trial to determine if the suspect is actually the perpetrator! This film subtly criticizes the revenge seekers by showing how the alleged guilty were people whose names were given out for money. This same criticism was made about George W. Bushs policy of abducting people and putting them in prison at Guantanamo Bay. This is based on the book Vengeance by George Jonas. The European locations were Malta and Hungary. Those killed were replaced by others, but this action was never repeated again (better protection or the threat of vengeance?). In 1971 Nixon abolished the gold standard for US currency and banned the production of any note greater than $100 denomination.
Some of the scenes in this film lack classic good taste.",1243555200,,2850,4.6600397614314115
1540810,4,B00005JOIH,"When Tony Kushner sticks to actual events, he's got a fast, thrilling script for Spielberg to work. The trouble is, a fine action movie is saddled with philosophical meanderings. The obviously contrived debate between the Mossad assassin and the PLO guy, the same old hackneyed arguments about what is essentially a land dispute, well, come on, why didn't the PLO guy realize Eric Bana really was a Jew? All the PLO fighters tell you how much they love their Palestine and Allah is their leader. Of course, the barbarity that meets their aims, all praised in heaven. Jews prefer a settled life on Earth be as it may, but there's little peace in the Middle East.

I must tell you, The Soprano's or Godfather movies were suggested by the Munich revenge assassinations. The Mossad is so careful not to knock off civilians, too careful perhaps as their foes could care less.

1540812,5,B00005JOIH,"This is a fine movie, one of the Steven Spielberg's best efforts. Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.

Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she.

 It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.

That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.

Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks?  Basically, it is his view vs. how Israel responds. (Israel wasn't real pleased with this film, and I understand that. I think they are right, but I still love the film.)

The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended.",1237852800,,1557,4.619565217391305

What did you expect him to show the other side of those stories? Actually he could have, Africans sold slaves. Germany was in a gigantic depression.

But this film surprised me. Spielberg knew he was going to take criticism for treating this problem even handedly. He's Jewish after all. He raises questions that are uncomfortable for the good guy/bad guy crowd. So it's no surprise there are a bunch of 1 star reviews. Of course they hate him for questioning right wing dogma. I'm gonna give him a 5 star for being brave. Good for you Steven.

As for the film. I liked it. It's not something I'd want to watch repeatedly, it could use a little editing. It's not a fun film to watch.

1540874,5,B00005JOIH,"I first saw the movie when it came out in theaters in December 2005, and was ultimately forgotten by me, until I decided to buy it on DVD two and a half years later and watched it again.  And I found that the movie was highly enjoyable, entertaining, and something that I could easily watch again and again just for the character interaction.

Sometimes it seems ridiculous to base politics and beliefs off what is seen in movies, but this wouldn't be the first time it's happened to me; before seeing the movie, I saw Israel as the wrong party in the Middle East, having stolen Palestinian land, and then leeching US assistance in oppressing Palestinians just because they lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.  After this movie, I can't see either side as bad.  It's a conflict beyond black and white whose basest participants are nowhere near anything resembling Stalinist or Hitleresque evil people they are made out to be by their enemies via propaganda or extremist ideology.

The opening sequence of the movie is done in amazing fashion that makes you feel as though you are watching the news and hearing about the events unfold in real time with your supportive Muslim family and your tense, frozen-stiff with terror Jewish family, while you also get very beautifully shot and gory scenes of the Black September terrorists breaking into the Israeli athletes' hotel room in Munich, where the fighting and conflict is so well-directed, you feel as if you were one of the Israelis, and that if you just stayed quiet and followed orders, you would make it out alive.

What ultimately happens is already well-known, but still hits painfully, and with the simultaneous reading of the Israeli names of the victims on the news with the Palestinian names of those who planned the botched kidnapping listed off by Mossad high command.

Every character that is come across in the film is interesting, and has innate chemistry with whomever else they're talking to.  Eric Bana as Avner is perfect in the role, being highly sympathetic even as he is indeed a terrorist.  Ciaran Hinds as Carl plays the father-like figure to Avner and the rest of the group, like a rock holding the makeshift family together.  Daniel Craig as Steve is the quintessential hothead who seems the be the prototypical terrorist in that he is driven purely by hatred for the Palestinians, yet is still well-rounded in that he is a believable, likeable person, without any characteristics that seem wildly out of character for him.  Matheiu Kassovitz as Robert is the makeshift bombmaker, who manages some minor humor that is in no way out of place or inappropriate.

Even their enemies in the conflict are keenly humanized without being overly apologetic, from Abdel Wael Zwaiter in Rome, who is clumsily killed while trying to talk and reason with a highly nervous and tense duo of Avner and Robert, Hussein Al Bashir's brief conversation with Avner in the Cyprus hotel balcony before the bomb under his bed blows him up, and nearly kills Avner and two civilians in the process, to Louis's intentionally bunking the four Mossad agents in an old apartment with a group of Palestinians at the same time, the two groups forced to keep their identities and intentions a secret or else risk exposing their plans to the enemy.

This sequence also has some lighter, and yet in the broader context most deeply disturbing, moments, such as Steve and a Palestinian silently fighting over what music to play on the radio, before mutually settling on an American station (I forgot what type of music), and Avner arguing Arab/Israeli politics with the Palestinian group's leader, with the Palestinian's conclusion that the reason to fight the Israelis over Palestine is that a home is more important than anything else.

Like with most any movie involving a makeshift ""family"" between comrades, there's always the series of events that leads to its dissolution, and for viewers like me, a sense of that time being the best time of their lives, and the (survivors') lives afterwards being bleak and emptier without the comradery.  Indeed, even Spielberg said of the character of Avner ""I don't think he'll ever find peace"".

For the negatives, I think the biggest downpoint of the movie would be the poorly-explained, completely fictional and unimportant French connection involving ""Louis"" and his whole amoral spy network of secret information and connections that seemingly works everywhere with everyone from terrorists to first world countries, in a sort of ""Quantam"" (""Quantam of Solace"") sort of 'apathetic godly overseer' type role.  While at the very least the conversations had with Avner and the old man (forgot his name) at the head of the family, I didn't find it to be all that necessary, and would have spoken more for Mossad's intelligence capabilities if the information on their targets had come from Mossad instead of from an unnamed, barely known, seemingly unstructured independent French organization with eyes all over the world and no real desire to do anything with it but sell information to the highest bidder.

While there are flaws, it's definitely a movie both tragic and enrapturing, grittily shot and realistically depicted, with intense chemistry between virtually everyone involved that makes it worth multiple viewings and owning.",1230595200,2,5318,4.989830508474577

1540877,2,B00005JOIH,"How could people be so cruel? How can people commit acts of terror? Are they just not like us, which is to say morally inferior? Study of history is crucial to understanding these questions. Ever hear about what happened at Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948? Or at Kafar Qasem on October 29, 1956. How much do we know about the founding of the Israeli state and what that meant for those non-Jews living in what was then the country of Palestine?

Steven Spielberg is incapable of making a truly bad movie. He's one of
America's most entertaining and talented popular directors. Maybe the most popular. Spielberg movies are good Hollywood stuff. So, I very much enjoyed MUNICH as a suspenseful political/espionage action thriller. But truly useful in understanding history? Nah. Enjoy it as a well crafted Spielberg movie.

If your an American you either A) passionately feel this film is unfair or even biased against Israel, or B) that it offers a challenging exploration of moral complexity and so on. You know shows ""both sides"". My sympathies much more with the latter, however I disagree with both. My guess would be that really only in America could there be such perceptions.

The first part of the film portrays the events which took place in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games. It is an amazing bit of filmmaking, making you witness to the tragedy. The second part of the film portrays the Israel response and it is largely fictious as director of the film Spielberg says so himself but some of the killings were depicted accurately.

We get to know the head Jewish assassin, ""Avner"", played by the likable, intelligent and handsome Eric Bana. We meet his beautiful and see them together. We meet his mother who is quite an interesting character, but I'll not get into why...(I suspect Spielberg may have been saying something with this character, but who knows). We see the tragic terrorist attack in Munich and rightly are disturbed by this. We watch the top officials of the Israeli government decide on the proper response and we meet Golda Meir who is sort of Big Grandma of Israel.  Anway, it is clear that Israel must assassinate the terorists. No point in capturing any? Guess not. It is historically true is the Israeli government did murder those suspected have involvement along with some that may not have been and of course innocent civilians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the mission was called ""Operation Wrath of God"" and so what does international law matter.

Spielberg said he did not want to do a Charles Bronson DEATH WISH revenge flick. So, we see conflcit in our hero Avner and we do meet a terrorist A-Rab. The Palestinian is allowed to speak of the Olive Trees and land of his people before being blown away. MUNICH does NOT show, doesn't dare show and nor does any character speak of what motivated the terrorist Muslims. In MUNICH we can admit they are human and it seems to be admited there is such a thing as a Palestinian -and for this along an adminition that things in the real world aren't always black and white Spielberg incured the wrath of, if not of God Himself, at least his spokespersons on Earth in the form of certain groups and individuals I'll not bother mentioning because quite frankly they're best left ignored as much as possible. If your American you'd do well to read what you can from the Israeli press which on the whole covers the business of that country much, much better and has a wider variety of view points than anything you can get from the mainstream media in the US.",1229299200,2,3557,4.674121405750799
1540878,1,B00005JOIH,"I love Eric Bana and Stephen Spielberg most of the time, but this is not history.  The argument has been made that, though the history may be flawed, the film should be judged on it's artistic merits.  That is all well and good, but when filmmakers, especially those with the influence of a Spielberg, adjust history to fit their worldviews, people in the real world are influenced and may suffer.  The fact is that a group of terrorists, who spoke in terms of martyrdom, and in the midst of a wave of global terrorism, decided to target unarmed athletes at the 1972 ""Olympics of Peace.""

  Israel's response was reasonable and measure, if not without mistakes, undertaken by professionals to target those involve in an ongoing campaign to kill its citizens. Spielberg's naked attempt to draw some kind of moral equivalence is vile. In totalitarian states that sponsor terrorism and teach their children suicidal hatred, fanciful plays on reality such as this are of no consequence.  But in democratic societies, were voters are influenced by largely fictional films pushing the phrase ""inspired buy actual events,"" voters are moved and policies influence, which can and do put real people at risk.

What dose God do with his warriors that defend Israeli? Dose he reward them with great riches and peaces and happiness? Why no! At lest not in Stephen Spielberg's take on Operation Wrath of God, the Israeli respond for the 1972 massacre by the Black September Movement that caused the violent death of eleven Israeli wrestlers.

Mossad agent Avner Kaufman is tasked as God's avenging hand, he and four other men systematically take out a series of men believed to have planned the Munich massacre. Like the a stealthy predator these man invoke God's promise to punish those to raise their hand against his chosen land. However has the team moves up the food chain they see that their actions have not in anyway made Israeli safer, it seems that with each of the Munich planner's they kill, another strike is made at Israeli, letter bombs, a man machine gun spraying people at an airport, and even Avner team becomes the target of retaliation.

Instead of being reward for his defense of Israeli Avner becomes paranoid, ripping apart his room, looking for traps and sleeping in the closet. He becomes disillusion with his mission and disillusion with Israeli, he sees a never ending cycle of violence that he doesn't want to be a part of.

Spielberg graphically illustrates that futility of clandestine counter-terrorism operations, for every man that they killed another comes in their place. The weight on Avner shoulders becomes so great that he even begins to question the legitimacy of the evidence that they are killing the right men. As he walks away from his Mossad handler for the last time in Brooklyn, the Twin Towers can be seen in the background.

Ones views on this movie depends on how one views the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So say the Spielberg is glorifying the ""Israeli killer"" and demonizing the ""Palestinian heroes"". Other say the exact opposite that Munich is trying to humanize the Palestinians and demonize the Israelis.

With that said, I don't expect that my thoughts on this film to be popular and that is likely a good thing. But if you have not watched this film yet, I suggest that you read them through.

In this film, Steven Spielberg takes us many steps closer to a world where ""justice"" is non-existent and ""revenge"" is the replacement term. We are all the worse for it.

It is clear from the contradictory and unbelievable opening comments from the ""Golda Meir"" character that we are going to be watching a ""fantasy"" of what Hollywood would like us to believe could have possibly taken place in the aftermath of these terrorist attacks.

Israelis and particularly Israeli war veterans, intelligence officers, politicians and military are not often the sort of impotent, confused, unprofessional characters portrayed in this film. Are they human? Do they question what they're doing and why? Surely. But not in the fanciful, public, and almost ludicrous manner showcased here. In addition to this, the idea that Mossad agents would forget all their training and run around Europe practically looking to get killed is idealistic stupidity and a totally deceitful presentation of the facts. The whole film sadly attempts to make a point about revenge and peace while sacrificing truth and sanity in the process.

From the Arabs, to the Israelis, to the Europeans, everyone seems unsure and confused about who they are and what they're doing. But the reality is something much different.

How could Spielberg have saved this film? Simply put, he needed to be rational and honest about the individuals involved, their motivations, principals and ideology. The revised ""ideology"" that is injected into these characters has them instead reciting quotes from both the Bush's administration post 9-11 party line as well as the media's talking-points as regards peace, morality, law, etc.

This breaks the audience's sense of what Hitchcock called the ""suspension of disbelief"" and reminds us that this is just more Hollywood fluff, albeit with a serious, somewhat artsy tone.

What is relevant here is that a number of terrorists carried out a horrifically unjust act of murder at the Munich Olympics, and that they needed to be punished for what they did as well as prevented from doing it again - upholding the virtues of justice, freedom and rationality. The idea that this is somehow an unjust response because it may lead to more violence is not just irrational, but monstrous. Whether or not 10,000 more people would need to die, we must never relinquish our right as individuals to defend the principals of justice and more importantly - our lives.

Novelist Ayn Rand said of justice:

""It is not justice or equal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from praising men's virtues and from condemning men's vices. When your impartial attitude declares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may expect anything from you--whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?""",1203811200,10,3150,4.9961832061068705
1540955,3,B00005JOIH,"I thought the movie was mediocre at best.  Spielberg failed to make any case, relative to terrorism, response to terrorism and their costs to those that fight or engage in either.

Based on any number of books, including ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, Spielberg's story misrepresented history for what purpose I am not willing to conceive.  It is important to relate history accurately in some fashion, and his changing of the facts certainly makes the Israelis appear similarly cruel and randomly violent if not worse that the terrorists.  Munich was only one of an extraordinarily large number of terrorist atrocities perpetrated against Israel and its supporters.  The Munich terrorist attack was just the catalyst for the Israeli response, hardly an unmeasured response as depicted in the movie.

To his credit, I think Spielberg tried to keep the Munich horror alive through the movie with the continued flashbacks, but those short bursts of terrorism failed to overcome the constant and violent portrayal of the Israelis as they tracked and assassinated the planners and financiers of the terrorism.  I wish there were a better way to bring terrorists to justice; I'm not at all certain there is a more effective method, certainly when they are protected democratic and totalitarian governments alike.

I suspect the movie accurately projects what we will continue to see as harsh measures necessary to combat terrorism, and for that I agree with the movie.",1202947200,2,1461,5.187234042553191

I appreciated how Spielberg was even handed in presenting the story, he showed the horror of the events in Munich in 1972, but also showed you that everything is not always black and white, this film deals in very gray areas.  I thought the acting was top notch, especially the lady who played Golda Meir and the lady that played Bana's mother, she was very powerful; she was only in a few scenes, but I was mesmerized by her.  This movie is quite long, but does not feel that way, frankly their is alot of things that have to be explained.  Bana makes his character very human, he makes mistakes and he is conflicted in the end over what he is doing, this eats at him like a cancer and his paranoia is very believable at the end.  I thought the last scene where, Bana asked Rush if he will come break bread with him, and old jewish custom, and Rush declines; and he does this right after speaking to what Israel means and what it means to be a Jew; I think that sums up to Bana what he has given up and for what.

1540958,5,B00005JOIH,"From the unforgettable, exquisitely beautiful and haunting ""lament"" that brackets the movie like two bookends, to the equally unforgettable ""lines"" sprinkled throughout (such as ""I am just the voice in your head telling you what you already know,"" and ""being victims of the holocaust does not make you decent.""), to the skill with which each scene is handled, we know from the start that Munich is going to be ""very high"" art, indeed.  But most importantly, we know it because of the way it takes a facile emotional theme -- the raid on the Olympic Village in Munich in 1972 -- wrings all of the cathartic emotional content out of it, and then once it is completely drained, turns it back in on itself so that the moviegoer can see that his emotions have been tricked into looking back in the mirror at a reflection of his own future diminished humanity.

Thus, the underlying message of the movie is that: Terrorism is one challenge; losing our souls trying to fight it, is quite another one, and arguably a much larger challenge. Put simply, in a terrorist run world, unless the more civilized protagonist continues to hold himself to a higher standard, the most likely outcome is a world of greatly diminished humanity.

In this larger sense, the movie then is not what it seems on the surface: a mere strumming of the familiar chords of sympathy for the Israeli fight against terrorism. Instead, at a much deeper level it is a cautionary tale about what can happen to the American soul, and about how the American mind must finally comes to grips with the new existential challenge of our times, terrorism. But it is about a much deeper fear than just terrorism itself; it is about the collective fear that we all share: That if we are not careful, in the process of trying to fight terrorism (as Israel has itself failed to do), we too might lose what is left of our own moral souls and with it, lose also our humanity, and all of our cherish values and ideals to boot. Thus in ""Munich"" Israel is more a psychological ""prop,"" a ""screen"" indeed a ""mirror,"" for the U.S. to see itself better in this post-911 world, a mirror against which America can finally begin to reflect on how being on the ""receiving end,"" instead of on the ""dishing out"" end of terrorism may eventually play itself out. Munich is about America's future, not about Israel's.

The movie begins simply enough as just another updated ""Western,"" with ""an elite extra-legal secret team"" and ""Arab terrorists"" substituting respectively for ""cowboys"" and ""Indians."" The secret team is hired by its government to hunt down the Arab terrorists one-by-one; and they do so with relentless and ruthless efficiency. However, after several such clandestine murders of revenge, somehow, the air begins to seep out of the vigilante group's enthusiasm for pursuing their quarry. In the process of hunting down the culprits, they are forced to see themselves in the larger frame into which they have been placed: In order to stalk and find them, they are forced to humanize their quarry. The terrorists all have names and addresses, and families too.  They go to their kids PTA meetings and piano recitals, read and write poetry, fight for humanitarian causes, etc. Just as the extra-legal team begins to humanize and stalk their quarry, they invariably begin to see themselves in a different light. They begin to see their patriotic task for what it is, ""making state sponsored terrorists out of themselves,"" and in the process, it dehumanizes them in the same way that they have dehumanized their opponents.  As a result of this psychological role reversal, they begin to question their role, their mission -- their cause.

They do this even before they, ""the hunters"" discover that they have also already become the ""hunted"" -- fingered no less by the same spotters who sold them information on the whereabouts of the terrorists. When they finally realize that they have descended into another dimension of morality, an amoral world where they are just expendable pawns in a much higher more immoral and more corrupt game being played over their heads, it is too late. They discover much too late that they have been sacrificed to their own fates, in a game from which there are no safe havens, or respectable or even moral exits or retreats. Several of them are killed the rest condemned as ""expatriots"" to a life on the edge of sanity.

1540959,3,B00005JOIH,"I enjoy thriller/action movies and Munich looked like it would be an interesting one. In some ways, it was much better than a typical action movie, and in other ways worse.

At the very outset, a Palestinian terrorist group kidnapped and killed 11 Israeli Olympians as the Olympics were beginning in Munich. The movie then tells of Israel hiring special agents and their efforts to hunt down Palestinians in vengeance.

The unfortunate thing about Munich is how graphic and violent it is. With the story of assasins and Israeli/Palestinian conflict, violence is not surprising, but in my opinion, they could have filmed just as effective a movie without as much detail. For this reason, I would have to strongly caution people who do not like graphic films. On the other hand, it does not trivialize death. And it also tries to show how traumatic and haunting these events are, even months later, to ""hardened"" men like assassins.

The wonderful and amazing thing about Munich is how philosophical it is. Unlike many thriller movies that have a good guy and bad guys and thus a black and white conflict, this film shows the complexity of human thought and motivation and the complexity of conflict. The characters are shown as family men, working men, men who care about relationships and life, men who find their new assignment distasteful though necessary.

The conflict is highly complex. Various characters throughout the movie question what they're doing and why they're doing it. Is it right to be assassinating these chosen men without proof of their involvement in Munich? Is it right to trust their employer? They've been told to kill only the specified Palestinians, but what happens when their own teammate is murdered? Is it okay to then kill that colleague's murderer? What does it mean to be a Jew? Does it mean only that one is loyal to Israel? Or does it mean that one is righteous before God, obeying the Law more than the government?

Usually the end of a movie has definition and resolution, but Munich does not. The lead character is less sure of himself and his work than ever before in the movie. Through the course of his assignment, he had gradually become callous and vengeful. But as he saw violence only beget more violence, he questioned Israel's methods and his own loyalty to them. We are left with questions and doubts rather than a feeling of success or determination. This is a refreshing, more accurate portrayal of a world that is indeed not black and white.",1200009600,,2493,4.82903981264637

1541026,4,B00005JOIH,"Munich deals with the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Germany (hence the film's name). Once the Israeli state learns the full magnitude of the killings, political and defense leaders assemble a team of men to track down and assassinate those responsible. The movie is about that team of men, what they do, and how it affects them.

While all the performeers were excellent, Eric Bana (the protagonist) was particularly fantastic. Bana plays Avner, the leader of the Israeli team. He is a force to be reckoned with in this film, spinning on a dime from nonchalant about his deeds to wracked with guilt, coarsely brutal to meltingly tender. I have not seen Bana in many films (although he was the best part of the too-epic Troy), but he was amazing in Munich. Bana captured the two sides of conflict: a man who feels a duty to avenge his countrymen as well as a man who sees the humanity in his enemy. Just great, great work.

The message you come away with in this film - everyone loses. The terrorists killed innocent athletes. The Israeli team is sent to take out the terrorists. But as they track down the men, they realize that even terrorists have their own dreams of a homeland. They have wives, children. And when they kill the men responsible for the Munich murders, new men take their places within the terrorist organization. And the men of the Israeli team are left broken and haunted by what they have done. There is no end, just a violent rabbit hole that keeps on wending its way through the Middle East. I think that anyone who has followed world events would agree that this seems to be an accurate assessment.

This film is definitely worth watching, but it's not popcorn cinema. This film is a great example of how film can be riveting (if not exactly entertaining) and teach you something, make you think, and perhaps even change you.",1198886400,,1891,4.605341246290801

I remember killing people with guns and people blowing up by bomb implants by phone. The caller calls the receiver picks up and BAM.

Then I remember the main character having a family and being with them and such but that's about it.

I also recall it being a ""war thing"" as far as the killings went. The killers had next to no remorse and they cared not of their worried-sick families. I also recall families watching the news about the hostages being safe and then being slaughtered. The families were so distraught and full of sorrow and pouring tears. :^(

That's all I can recover from my memory banks.

1541030,4,B00005JOIH,"As always Spielberg has hit a home run. He does a great job of not completely making one side or another the villain. Most of the action in the movie is shown from the side of the Mossad hit squad's point of view, but that is the way the book it has been based on was written. Another reason is that the account in the book is written concisely and as impartial as possible given the situation. From that book Spielberg has put together a spellbinding movie that keeps you in suspense even if you are familiar with the real life events. The story follows the timeline pretty accurately, but as to the specifics no one will know them until evidence is released by the Israelis which won't be in any of ours or our great grandchildren lifetimes. The movie is also up to the high visual standards Spielberg sets for himself with each of his projects. The menus fit in with the other visuals, such as title, main credits, and look of the movie.

1541031,4,B00005JOIH,"Many talented people invested a great deal of effort in the making of Munich, and this passion shows. (The actor playing the role of a Palestinian gunman pacing onto the balcony of the Israeli compound in exact sequence with the infamous real life footage was utterly chilling.) My lack of total and complete admiration for this film comes from the fact that the quality of the plot was drastically uneven, there was not enough story to match its long run-time, and I could not escape the suspicion that much of what I was watching onscreen was simply a fiction, not based on actual events as claimed. Munich ran out of gas too early and never quite found its message, so it tried unsuccessfully to be about many things. What Munich did nicely was raise the question of when justice mutates into revenge, and when preventative counter-attacks to prevent future terrorism themselves become terrorism. As a movie it was better than most of what gets made in American cinema today but it was also disappointing given what it could have been with so much talent behind it.",1191456000,,1068,4.747311827956989

Steven Spielberg tackles this tough subject ever so perfectly.  It's quite a wonderful movie to watch as well.  It's so refreshing to see cinema being used as a way to teach more than just one to entertain.

I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's a definite must see, one that will give you a new perspective on life.

1541033,3,B00005JOIH,"The opening sequence of ""Munich"" relies heavily on ABC news footage about the murders of Israeli Olympic athletes in 1972. They are the most frightening and harrowing things about this movie, if only because we know that this particular nightmare really did happen. What came after, as documented in the book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vengeance-The-True-Story-of-an-Israeli-Counter-Terrorist-Team/dp/0743291646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team</a>,"" was that the Israeli government decided to covertly kill the men they had identified as having a hand in the Black September assassinations.

From there, ""Munich"" plods and meanders, striking a poor balance between the dreadful acts of Black September with the emotional/psychological state of Avner (Eric Bana, excellent here) and his cohorts. The dramatizations of the revenge killing do overstate what really happened - according to the book - and a very important endpoint is omitted. Avner is unceremoniously dumped by his employers once he backs away from this assignment; no money, no identity and no proof about what he did. It makes the final blathering about ""The Cycle of Violence"" ring a little false as Steven Spielberg pulls away from Avner and Ephrain (Geoffrey Rush, also well done in a creepy way) to expose the World Trade Center. ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values,"" intones Golda Mier as she issues the order to send assassins after the murders. Yet the questions begin to creep in over and over as the Black September organizers fall and are replaced...and Avner discovers that he and maybe his family have become the hunted...where does it end? Avner begins to pull away, bemoaning ""Every man we've killed has been replaced by worse!""

Other than the politics of the movie and the personal conflicts - there is a lot of talk about what it means to be a Jew and losing/keeping your soul - ""Munich"" is supposed to come off as a suspenseful spy flick. The passages between events are too long, the transitions too uncertain, however to maintain that suspense. The drawn out ending adds nothing to the movie, either. Reportedly edited on the fly with shots finalized within two days of shooting in some cases, one wonders what a little more time spent on a judicious edit might have accomplished. Tony Kushner's script is a stilted mess of pretensions and really could have been trimmed back.

It leaves ""Munich"" as a movie with such potential to tell a story and offer a moral lesson trapped in a moribund film. Speilberg's breif explaining his motivations for ""Munich"" and wanting not to make a statement about Israel's morality but about the ""unintended consequences"" of violence at the begining of the DVD actually say more about the movie than the movie does! The horrors of Munich 1972 should not be forgotten, but this isn't the movie that captures why.",1187395200,,2979,5.293868921775899
1541034,5,B00005JOIH,"How many more classic films can Spielberg make? I expected this to be good, but a running time of 2hrs 37mins was a black mark in my book before I'd seen a frame. However it is another classic, not as great a film as Schindlers List, but in many ways as moral a tale, but on a smaller scale.

How accurate the film is I have no idea, however the opening credits say ""inspired by true events"" and the killing of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in 1972 did happen and I don't think there is any doubt that revenge in one form or another was sort. In some ways the filmmaking style harks back to the 1970's as well. There is a gritty realism reminisent of the French Connection films here and you won't find a modern ""high octane"" thriller here (usually film advertised with that phrase are awful).

Eric Bana plays Avner, one of five chosen to find and kill the people who planned the attack. As the film progresses we see the doubts creep into Avner's mind about what he's doing. In fact in essence the message of this movie is ""killing people f**ks you up"". The only reason it won't is if you are either already a religious extremist or a complete psychotic. The performances are all good and the rest of the cast is very strong. As well as Bana there is Daniel Craig and Geoffery Rush.

This is an intelligent film that asks some serious questions about an eye for an eye etc, but don't let that put you off. It is still a cracking good thriller and Spielberg once again shows why he is the most successful director in the history of cinema, as well as being one the most talented as well (success and talent do not always go together!).",1187308800,2,1649,4.312903225806451

Others may not grasp the concept that Israel is the only Jewish Country in the World, There are numerous Christian and Islamic countries.

1541091,4,B00005JOIH,"First let me say that I enjoyed this film. The subject is of great interest to me and despite a few flaws I think the film is overall, much better than many have given it credit for. I watched 'Munich' for the first time quite awhile ago but felt compelled to ofer my analysis after reading the wide-ranging reviews on here. I think it is significant that Spielberg has been accused of being both too pro-Israeli, and too pro-Palestinian/terrorist. I would argue that the majority of these critics on either side are extremists themselves, and are therefore unable to appreciate the film's complexity and OBJECTIVITY. If you see the situation in black and white, then you are not going to be satisfied with the portrayal of events in 'Munich.' With that said, Spielberg himself said that the film is in no way intended to question the morality of Israel's retaliation, but to explore the ""unintended consequences"" of these actions. Whatever. Personally I thought the film was quite ambiguous, and thus it is not surprising that there are so many contradictory reviews. I will say one subtle but interesting theme that I picked up on; 'Munich' seems to be asking if the Israelis have gotten so caught up in being Israeli, that they have forgotten how to be Jewish.

I thought the acting was good all-around, especially Eric Bana as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, and the underrated Ciaran Hinds as Carl. As with all of Spielberg's films, the cinematography, dialogue, and character development are all excellent. Say what you will about him, Spielberg knows how to make good films. He has the talent for putting nice touches on his films, like the recurring soundtrack of a beating heart in scenes of impending danger here in Munich. All in all, a very suspenseful and action-packed film.

As for the flaws, I agree that it began to drag a bit at the end and probably could have had twenty minutes or so edited out. As for the factual accuracy, I agree that some of the elements (like the French family of information brokers) were a bit of a reach, but as I always say, this is movie, not a documentary, and this did nothing to damage the film's ""watchability"" in my opinion.

In conclusion, I would rate this film 4 out of 5 stars. Whether it is ambiguity or objectivity, I'm not quite sure, but there is something in 'Munich' for either side of the conflict to take issue with. Personally I think that is a good thing.",1186444800,6,2422,4.68075117370892

1541093,3,B00005JOIH,"The film started off well, but got rather boring and turned out to be very pro-Jewish/pro-Israel although in a subtle way.

One of the interesting things about the film is that I found it sort of ironic that they played pop American 60s and 70s music in the background which reminds many of the black power and the civil rights era.  Perhaps it was meant to mean that the Iraelis are fighting for their freedom just as the blacks in America (I don't believe that BTW).

I didn't like how it seemed as though the Mossad agents could walk though walls and do pretty much whatever they pleased.  It was like bullets could bounce off of them.  More of them were probably wounded in real life and I seriously doubt that tracking down and killing the suspects was as easy as it seemed in this film.  I was wishing something unfortuanate would happen to the main character, because he was portrayed as somewhat of a superman.

The final scene was stupid... intimacy with the man's wife was shown as a metaphor for his frustration and passion for tracking down the suspects involved in the Munich olympic massacre.",1184025600,,1106,4.583756345177665

From Kindergarten on, we are told to turn the other cheek, tell the teacher, sticks and stones... blah, blah, blah. Here, however, is another take on this dilemma, one terribly relevant, it would seem, in this time of arbitrary killings, defended by grinning thugs. We can wring our collective hands or we can act. This film takes on this subject in a time when America's revenge genre, the Western, has gone out of fashion. ""Munich"" really is ""The Unforgiven"" set in Europe. The killers are hunted down and killed in return. It's more or less as simple as that, but here one is asked to identify with the assassins and to ask oneself if it would be as easy as it may have seemed, in so many movies where the good guys catch up with the bad guys. It's a film built around an ethical issue, a real issue, it seems to me. The film is not fully satisfying, but it is hard to say why. The acting is fantastic. I came away thinking the ending was weak. The entire sequence is New York seemed soft and sentimental suddenly and out of keeping with the film. The screen play by Kushner has other weaknesses. For example, I had trouble accepting that these guys would be so amateurish. Each killing is botched, which, were the assassins American, would seem believable but, given that they are Israeli, the finest intelligence units the world, it seemed somehow contrived. The setting is great, the subject matter thankfully adult, and it is finally a political film, which is a rare and fine thing.",1183334400,,1562,4.562277580071174
1541095,3,B00005JOIH,"""They're all gone,"" intones sportscaster Jim McKay. McKay and other ABC news folks of 1972 have their TV footage mixed with a quick montage of violent filmed movie scenes of the '72 Olympics where 11 Israeli Olympians were massacred by the Arab Black September group.

Five men led by a young Israeli named Avner are assembled to revenge the massacre of the Munich Olympians. The Munich Avengers hook up with a family that has been in private intelligence since the Vichy Government ran France during World War Two. Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is its patriarch. He becomes a sage to the Five. ""Never work for any government"" he warns. Well, its a little late to change that just now. At first everything goes swimmingly. The movie looks like other well made thrillers. These 'pros' who have never exactly done this kind of work in their lives 'seem' very successful.

Thriller afficionados will remember Michael Lonsdale as the French inspector who traced assassin Edward Fox across France in the Day of the Jackal 33 years ago. Older and heavier, Lonsdale is right at home as patriarch of the French family aiding the Israeli assassins in targeting their victims.

The Israelis find themselves sharing a room in Athens with five Arab Assassins but arrange a truce by convincing the Arabs they are part of the German Beider-Meinhof gang. Avner discusses middle east morality and politics with the Arab gang leader. Avner is seen by the audience as losing that argument. Later the forger has to 'fix' a foiled murder attempt in a hotel room. He is wounded. Several of the Arabs Avner's crew boarded with are killed in a gunfight outside. Carl (Cirian Hands) is murdered in bed later by a comely prostitute after Avner has turned the woman down. The Israeli avengers trace her to a Brussels houseboat where each fires a shot into her as she vainly attempts a seductive but grotesque striptease to save her life. An attempt to kill the architect of the Munich Murders is foiled when five Brits, posing as drunks, interfere. Avner's men are now aware they are being followed and watched. Who do the five Brits work for, the CIA or Britain's MI-6? The hunters are now the hunted.

The foiled Assassination perplexes and demoralizes. Their Israeli handler Ephraim calls Avner home to tell him their work is splendid. Not to them it isn't. Avner doesn't want to continue. He suspects they have killed Arabs not involved in Munich and balks at giving names and addresses of contacts to Ephraim. They discover the CIA has protection deals with some of their targets. The remaining Four don't know who is after them or for what. Two more die and a demoralized Avner and Steve(Daniel Craig) split up.

Afraid now, Avner flees to his wife and baby in Brooklyn. But unknown agents follow and scare him. Avener fears for his wife and child. He attacks a bureaucrat in the Israeli Mossad office in Manhattan. He is desperate now. Ephraim meets with him and admits some of the six killed were not Black September but old Israeli scores being settled. Avner won't cooperate with Israel now. And Ephraim won't help him if Avner doesn't agree to continue.

Except for a nightmare-freighted, overdone sexual episode between Avner and his wife, the film is effectively over. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner have carved this thriller into a political morality tale. The Israelis cannot assume the higher moral ground if they are as murderous as Black September. Every act of revenge sews the seeds of more violence and death. What is the point of that, ask the Authors? An Arab character argues with Avner that the Jews in Israel are outnumbered by the Arab populations that are all around them and growing in numbers much faster than the Israelis. The Authors are saying the Israelis will never win, that time is on the side of the Arabs. Israel will not win and will not survive.

I agree with them. The American War in Iraq will not succeed either. Americans and Israelis will both lose because the Arabs are fighting for their homeland. The Americans, and the Israelis who claim THEY are fighting for their homeland, cannot succeed.

Spielberg and Kushner have loaded the dice too heavily here. Avner and his four henchmen have an underlying innocence about international terrorism calculated to buttress this story and its moral. But would the Israelis really have chosen such a bunch of innocent plebes to carry out a mission as cynical, dangerous and important as this one? Its a great story but it won't play in Bagdhad, Tel Aviv or Peoria not to mention on the big screen.",1181001600,2,4564,4.819923371647509
1541096,4,B00005JOIH,"I was very curious to see this chapter of history. The story of the 11 Israeli athletes getting killed by Palestinian terrorists and the story that followed. I feel the actors chosen to play the characters couldn't have been better and the movie itself was incredible. However I feel the message that was sent to the movie going public was the incorrect one. (Caution: when I say incorrect I don't mean untrue)

Right now we are living in a very controversial time where the situation in the Middle East is a very sensitive subject. I am one who wants to see peace, but with the violence escalating every day we are far from reaching that goal. What people need to understand is that only one side wants peace and unfortunately `Munich' did not elaborate on that enough. The Israeli task force is depicted to be just as uncaring as the Palestinian extremist groups in this movie. (Never do they show actual Palastinans that truly want peace).  In the beginning the message is to kill the plotters of the Munich murders and in the end the Israelis are leaving bodies uncovered in shame and the main character gives up his love for his homeland. The scene where Eric Bana's character sees himself fighting along side the terrorists is an absolute disgrace. The pieces of the movie that should have been elaborated more were the people they were killing. These were Palestinian officials high in power living far away from the Palestinian hostage camps in lavish mansions and accepting money from all different governments just to keep the violence going. Those are actual living breathing people in the P.L.O. that are still alive today.  The should have made it more clear that the mission was to kill the terrorists and not to hurt the innocent Palestinians like the women and children as well as Palestinian men that had nothing to do with assassinating Jewish people.

Is this movie good...yes it is a brilliant film worthy of its credit. Will is be nominated for awards...absolutely. I don't think that Spielberg displayed anything untrue in this movie. He did however show more sympathy towards the wrong side. I believe his message was to say he wants peace and the only way to show that was that both sides shedding blood constantly would only make it worse and there never will be peace. I feel there is nothing wrong with showing there are two sides fighting and only one side wants peace. If the world can understand that there are certain people (not a nation) that don't then the true evils in this world will be wiped out and there finally will be peace.",1180483200,2,2566,4.708240534521158
1541097,4,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg took a lot of flack for ""Munich,"" which he admits is neither pro-Israeli nor pro-Palestinian.  From Spielberg, I suppose many expected - or wanted - something more ardently Zionist.  But Spielberg cast the die when he decided on George Jonas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vengeance-The-True-Story-of-an-Israeli-Counter-Terrorist-Team/dp/0743291646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team</a>&nbsp;as his source material.  Vengeance's point of view - and its tortuous history - is predicated on the moral ambivalence of 'Avner,' the pseudonym of the team leader, as played on-screen here by an excellent Eric Bana.  I read ""Vengeance"" a couple of months prior to seeing the film, and my feeling is that Spielberg accurately captured Avner's feelings as well as his metamorphosis.  The one thing that got left out was Avner's complex relationship with his Dad, who - in the book - essentially foretells Avner's denouement at the outset.

Jonas' book is controversial.  There are ongoing disputes over its inherent accuracy to the point where people doubt the essence of the story  or whether an 'Avner' actually existed.  In the most recent release - coinciding with the film - Richard Ben Cramer writes a nice new introduction with a pithy comment that the debate has evolved to the point where the essence of the argument is people now saying ""Hey, my part in the movie wasn't big enough.""

1541098,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich is a rather interesting film based on the book ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team,"" which was written by George Jonas. The author is a Hungarian born, Canadian writer.

Out of 14 books he has written, Vengeance is the story of an Israeli operation to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre that took place during the 1972 Olympic games.

Steven Spielberg directs the film and the DVD provides a rare interview in which Mr. Spielberg discusses that his movie is not anti-Israel and or pro-Palestinian. This got me curious... and as I researched the background, the interview is intended to dispel the protests of the author, who complained that Munich was a distorted interpretation of his original work.

In essence, Jonas said that scriptwriter Tony Kushner, a Jew who has referred to the formation of Israel as a mistake, failed to make a moral distinction between terrorism and legitimate military action.

Critics of the book said that Jonas's source for the book; New York security consultant Jubal Aviv had fabricated the story. Reading all these details got us rather curious about the film, which we obtained and finally watched.

The production is a thrilling recount of details that were unknown to us. The revenge plot puts forward the fact that when we set out to pay back for sins of the past, innocent people sometimes pay the price. The movie therefore, delves into complex issues of guilt, violence, murder, love, family... honor, and the defense of the right of the people of Israel to have a place they can call home.

The reliving of the events that lead and transpired during the kidnapping and murder of the athletes is... horrifying to say the least. Golda Meir is represented in this movie and she has a monologue where she weighs the actions and consequences of what they are about to do that is simply priceless soul-searching view of what any leader must go through as they guide a people or a nation towards survival.

The technology used to eliminate those responsible is interesting, the methods are at times careless and dangerous, the people that reveal the whereabouts of those to be killed are interesting, but mercenary and it is with great horror that we realize they provide information to both sides... at a high price, of course, gaining great wealth from all the violence that ensues.

From beginning to end, we found ourselves riveted on the screen, learning a lot and feeling that hindsight provides 20-20 vision on rather complex issues that while we are living them... leaves us all blind due to lack of total awareness of the powers at play. Don't miss it!",1179878400,,2653,4.893095768374165
1541099,4,B00005JOIH,"If Munich was just a Hollywood movie about a group of guys out to kill every member of a group of terrorists responsible for killing their friends, then this movie of revenge would had had so much more potential.  As it is, it is based on the true story of Islamic terrorists from a group Black September that take the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the 1972 Olympic games and kill 9 of them in a resulting rescue attempt. The Israeli Mossad creates a covert team to kill in secrecy every single person responsible from Black September responsible for that attack.

When Stephen Spielberg decided to make a movie based on the events of Munich, that instantly created a lot of expectations. I expect that a majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, see that what the Mossad did as justified. To make a movie about the Munich events and turn it into a celebration of what the Mossad did, a revenge flick, might have been the popular thing to do. I personally believe Israel had every right to retalliate the way it did, and believe the Palestinians deserved the fate they got in this movie. But I'm not naive to believe the Palestinians don't have a complaint about how they've been treated at times.

So, I went into this movie knowing it had received bad reviews and some cited it as revisionist history or basically saying what the Mossad did was just as bad as what Black September did. First of all, the movie is long but extremely well made. The story moves swifly and the violence is brutal.  Eric Bana plays Avner, the Mossad agent assigned the task of killing the Black September members one by one. Avner accepts the task and begins working with his team, which includes future Bond Daniel Craig. They buy information and carry out the executions. There are problems at times and the group must deal with faulty equipment and collateral damage.  But the ultimate villian they must face is the fact that just as they are hunting, they are now being hunted. Soon, they realize they must be on the lookout for attacks against them. At the same time, the weight of what they are doing begins to eat away at Avner's core. The killings are changing him, and they are keeping him away from his wife and newborn child.

I don't know enough about the true events of the Munich retalliation to comment on whether or not this movie got the historical facts correct. I do know many commented that the movie was a statement on the USA's current war on terror. Maybe that is correct, but Israel's been fighting the war on terror for years. I think Munich made points not for the benefit of today's Iraq war, but to show that what people assume is true now, was also true then. For one example, the point is made that when a member of Black September is killed, he is just replaced by someone else. So, what good does it do to kill one if a new one will take its place. This is a point to consider, but the movie never really takes a side. This is a movie really about a man, Avner, played excellently by Eric Bana. He eagerly fulfills his duty to his country, but the weight of his actions ultimately are too much for him to handle.

In conclusion, you won't be able to watch this movie without giving at least some thought the the history behind it as well as the current situation in Iraq.  That being said, I think you'll be able to enjoy this movie regardless of your political beliefs.",1177891200,2,3403,4.495145631067961
1541161,5,B00005JOIH,"I caught part of this movie on HBO.  I was spellbound by the part I saw and wanted to see the whole film.  I have, several times.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  In my opinion, there are many, many mediocre to poor quality films out there. This film is not one of them.  This film is intelligent, well-crafted, riveting film-making at its best.

This film starts out at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, where USA athletes returning to their Olympic village apartments after a late night of it, unwittingly/innocently help terrorists climb over the fence surrounding the village, thinking they are Olympic athletes who need help getting back to their rooms.  So begins the hostage taking and murder of 11 Israeli athletes that made world-wide news.

Golda Mier, Prime Minister of Israel, Israeli military and government leaders meet and it is decided to hunt down and kill, one by one, the men responsible for the Munich massacre.  Enter Eric Bana and crew, including Daniel Craig, who are assigned the task.  I agree with another reviewer who said this is a psychological thriller.  There is plenty of action though.

As they hunt down and assassinate the Munich masterminds, eventually they become hunted themselves.  I guess one message of this film is that violence begets violence.  I don't really think Steven Spielberg is making a political statement with this film.  The closing film credits show that this movie is based on the book, ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas.  I think it shows us the never-ending back and forth between two peoples who think they are both righteous.  Also, Eric Bana's character presents himself as an American representing American businessmen wanting the information on the Munich masterminds.  That was just a front.  He was an Israeli representing Israeli interests.

The closing shot of Avner (Eric Bana) and Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) walking away from each other - what we see in the background speaks volumes without saying a word.  You'll see what I mean.

This is also just my opinion, but I'd like to add that the French actor portraying Louie, I think his name is Mathieu Amalric, if they ever make a movie about the life of Roman Polanski, he could play the part.  Something about him reminded me of Polanski, even though Amalric is better looking by far.",1177891200,2,2328,4.837974683544304

1541163,5,B00005JOIH,"I thought this was a good film when I saw it in the theatre & was pleased to find a used DVD copy in the budget bin.  The DVD doesn't offer much extra in the one disc version other than brief comments by Steven Spielberg about the film's relation to the history.  To me, the film was a psychological thriller more than an action picture.

Australian actor Eric Bana who started out in comedy & became known for pictures like ""Black Hawk Down"" & ""Troy"" does a good job as Avner, the Mossad agent who is given the task of eliminating those who planned the Munich Olympic games massacre.  His breakdown into near madness and paranoia as the film progresses is well done, but seems to occur suddenly without really seeing him unravel.  I guess the discovery of Carl's nude corpse in the hotel room was supposed to send him over the edge.  It'll be interesting to see him as a gambler in ""Lucky You"" with Drew Barrymore & Robert Duval.

Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won his Oscar for ""Shine"" in 1996 and was twice more nominated for ""Shakespeare in Love"" & ""Quills.""  As Ephraim, he's the counter-intelligence mastermind who coordinates all these activities.

Daniel Craig, after numerous films like ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" ""The Jacket,"" & ""Layer Cake,"" finally became known as Double-O-7 James Bond in ""Casino Royale,"" for which he received a Best Actor nomination from the British Academy Awards.  As Steve, he does a good job of making it all the way through the movie, flying into action mode when required.  His blue eyes exude an intensity and focus that lifts the film.

Mathieu Kossovitz plays Robert the bomb maker who can never quite get the charges right.  First they're not strong enough; next too strong.  He won a Best Supporting Actor award for ""Munich"" from the National Association of Film Critics.  He is also known as a director.  He directed ""Gothika"" with Halle Berry and won the Cannes Best Director Award for ""La haine"" (Hate).  As an actor, he's played in films like ""Amelie"" and ""Birthday Girl"" with Nicole Kidman.  He does a nice job as the klutzy often-berated toy maker who has been tapped to be the bomber.

Irish Actor Ciran Hinds has a diverse number of films under his belt from ""The Weight of Water"" (which I reviewed as ""The Weight of Editing"") to ""Oscar & Lucinda"" & ""Miami Vice.""  He also played in ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" with Daniel Craig.  As Carl, he wears glasses and voices skepticism about the project and the authenticity of the intelligence on which they are acting.  His demise is a turning point in the film as we learn that the hunters are now also the hunted.

Other roles are also nicely done.  Hanns Ziscler appears as Hans in his 69th film.  Ayelet Zurer as Avner's wife Daphna does a nice job of being the brave mother & spouse.  Lynn Cohen, whose first film was Woody Allen's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery,"" does a convincing and controlled portrayal of Golda Meir.  Israeli actress Gila Almazor who won the Silver Bear Best Actress Award from the Berlin International Film Festival for ""The Summer of Avia"" in 1989 & does a good job as Avner's mother who urges him to avenge the villains for all of their ancestors.  French actors Michael Lonsdale who was in the first ""Day of the Jackal"" (1973) & another film I like very much, ""Ronin,"" does a good job as the wise Papa who trades information to feed his family.  Mathieu Amalric plays his son Louis who acts as the go-between with Avner.

""Munich"" won the Best Picture Award from the American Film Institute.  It was nominated for 5 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director & Best Editing.  While it is a long film, it is one that pulls me in and keeps me glued to the screen.  It was a moving cinematic adventure.  Enjoy!",1175731200,3,3771,4.629518072289157
1541164,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution.

The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to ""show people we're strong,"" but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy.

This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon.",1175558400,3,1898,5.13915857605178
1541165,5,B00005JOIH,"I just bought the DVD of Munich . I had heard that ""Munich"" was going to be long and dull and pointless, and boy was I glad I saw it anyway. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig are great in this.!

The film is almost a slasher movie in a screwed up way. It chronicles the journey of a hit man (played great by a very intense Eric Bana) who is hired in secret by the Israeli government , to kill off the terrorists responsible for the munich hostage taking and murders. His job is totally secret, like he doesn't exist at all. Then he travels Europe and hunts down these guys one by one and almost gets them all. Then he starts having doubts about the whole adventure when he starts to see the whole human aspect of it.

I found it very exciting.

As a cool perk, there's also Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond days. I'd almost say he's better here than as 007 , but Bana shines in this all the way through.

Munich was very well made and exciting and a strong filmmaker's vision. I think this is one of Spielberg's strongest movies to date. An extra perk is a short commentary by Spielberg before the movie starts, that shows us his intentions of making the movie.

I don't know why I stayed all the way through, but the closing scene, with the World Trade Center towers superimposed in the background was the final straw for me. The acting was not nearly as bad as the hectoring and lecturing about the evils of revenge. There is no historical record that the people involved in tracking down the murderers of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 had any second thoughts. This is especially true of Golda Meir, who saw that European governments were going to accommodate the latest band of Fascists known as Palestinian ""Freedom fighters"" but who are nothing but a band of murderers. I am sure her ghost will haunt Spielberg for this outrageous deceit.

Spielberg reminds me of his relatives who encouraged their young children to get on the trains to the concentration camps, since they couldn't believe that those nice Gestapo men would do anything bad.

I suppose when the Iranians deliver their nukes over Tel Aviv and wipe Israel off the Earth, he'll make another movie about how they were victims of American aggression, or some other such leftist nonsense.

This movie is a fiction, based upon historical events, but subverted by Spielberg's instincts to let the bad guys continue to kill until they have done him in, too.

Maybe he can donate some of his billions to the next annex to the Holocaust Museum in Washington when Israel disappears.

This movie is not a factual recount of 1972 slayings of Israeli Olympic athletes by the members of Palestinian terrorist group ""Black September"" in Munich, Germany even though it is based on the real events. After the murders, a group of Mossad agents are sent to Europe to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible. What the movie explores is how in doing so with burning desire to find and punish the murderers, in following the ancient law of an eye for an eye, the searchers for justice nearly become terrorists themselves. You can't just look into abyss and stay the same because, ""When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.""

In his new, easily one of the best films he ever made (in the same line as ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), Spielberg looks at terrorism from many different angles. He does not justify killings, and there are many, many terrifying killings in his film and behind every death there is a human character and every character is a real person, not cartoonish villain or a super-hero. Devastating, powerful, and controversial this film will split the audiences and will have as many admirers as haters.

1541239,4,B00005JOIH,"I have to give the director, producers, actors, and screen writers credit for taking on an ambitious project that is destined not to please everyone. There are both strengths and weaknesses to the film.

First, the strengths, of which there are many. The film does a relatively admirable job of portraying historic events, while maintaining the pace of an action thriller, while integrating thoughtful dialogue regarding the cyclic nature of revenge. The events at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich were shocking and stunned the world. The Black Sunday group, associated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, conduct a kidnapping and mass murder in front of the entire world. The film does an exceptional job of capturing this horrific series of events. The film also does an admirable job of capturing the political dialogue between Golda Meir and her cabinet after the events. The cast is exceptional with Eric Bana playing Avner, the assassin, with considerable depth and skill. Bana's performance was superb. Avner is joined by a team of collegues who help him track down 9 of the 11 terrorists or those who planned the event. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Ephraim, the team's only contact with the Israelis. Daniel Craig as Steve and Ciaran Hinds as Carl are outstanding. The French informant, Louis, played by the French actor Mathieu Amalric, is great. The dialogue is excellent, much of it written by the very talented Tony Kushner. It is the dialogue that is interwoven with the action sequences that pushes the film to a higher motive. The scene where Eric Bana, acting as if he is a German, dialogues with a young Palestinian about the claiming of Israel by both the Jews and the Palestinians. Of course this is no James Bond thriller where everything goes as planned. In fact, nothing really goes as planned  and it is the unexpected that gives the film tension. However the most outstanding change in plot occurs when the team realizes that they may be the hunters but someone is hunting them!

There were two issues that kept me from giving the film 5 stars. First, the writers decided not to get into a messy group of hundreds of informers and contacts and instead decided to write the story as if some French underground family supplied the team the names, addresses, and iteneraries of all the major PLO terrorist leadership. Whereas this certainly simplified the story, it certainly seems beyond belief. It appeared to be a literary license the screen writers took to cover up hundreds of persons who were involved in this series of revenge killings across Europe. My second criticism is the flashbacks that Avner has throughout the film of the actual events in Munich. Whereas this worked well to continually remind the viewer of the reasons this team is hunting down the PLO planners, leaders, and soldiers; it reached the point of overkill when Avner flashes back to the final minutes where the athletes were killed in the two  helicopters. Avner has this flashback while having intercourse with his wife so that the moment of death for the Israeli athletes corresponds with Avner's orgasm. What is the point here? I interpreted this that despite the murder of Jews, they will continue to thrive, defend themselves, and will successfully survive on this earth despite the hatred and prejudice.

At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is a long film, but will keep you engaged every second!",1171843200,7,3408,4.930313588850174
1541240,5,B00005JOIH,"Spielberg's schizophrenic world view is on grandeur display in this movie. I like Spielberg. I really do. Like what Harry Knowles from Ain't it Cool News website says; he makes two types of movies. One to satisfy his innerchild, his curious pre-adolescent youth that he either cherishes so much that he makes movies like ""The Goonies"", ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy, ""E.T."" etc. to ""mourn"" the loss of that period of innocence. Another part of him makes self-important films that may seem to indulgent or even forced. Spielberg excels in the former. He hits and misses with the latter.

Hits:

Schindler's List

Saving Private Ryan (1st 25 minutes of the film: D-Day invasion)

Empire of the Sun

Munich

Misses:

The Colour Purple

Amistad

A.I. (Kubrick should have made this before he died)

Out of the ""serious"" films, Schindler's List and Munich stands out as giants. I consider Saving Private Ryan as an adventure flick for boy scouts with grand plans on enlisting as marines.

With this issue aside, first off; Munich is a fine movie. One of the best film of 2005. Upon seeing it the first time in the cinema, I experienced the most nail-biting suspense welling in my chest. A sense of impending doom and horror unfolding before me onscreen as Spielberg skilfully reenacted the entire Munich hostage takeover. Of course, I know the outcome, but it's the process that hits you most. Yes, and man can be more bestial and monstrous than any other beasts in the world. No amount of explanation or hypothesis could explain the rationale behind the horrific and senseless murder of the athletes.

The acting in the movie is rather dispensable. Eric Bana made a valiant effort in trying to stand out, but I feel that Spielberg is of course, the star here. In any case, this may be an attempt by the man to score a hat-trick with the directing award at the Oscars. In any case Ciaran Hinds also makes a fine supporting role as a venerable mentor to Bana's character.

Ultimately, you have to decide on your own whether reprisals, political or clandestine, will work to counter potential terrorism. As Spielberg is trying to imply here, there will be no end to cycle of violence, pain and sorrow. As a blatant reminder to that, he closes the movie with no less than a clear skyline shot of the World Trade Center towers, ""helpfully"" reminding us that the West got their comeuppance as far as violent reprisals go.

Onto the DVD itself. I own the 2-disc set. It does come with a beautiful booklet that doubles as an insert. However, it's nothing more than a coffee table book with blurbs from the various critics heaping praises on the film. The 2nd disc is quite informative actually, and Mr. Spielberg is not providing an audio commentary on the feature film either. Since, it's out of print, I guess the rest of us have to settle with the 1-disc set, unless Universal pulls its tricks with a double-dip, which I highly suspect they might.",1171238400,4,2932,4.734774066797643
1541241,5,B00005JOIH,"Months after the hype and debate, Munich stands up well to re-examination. The London sequences still look like they were shot in Hungary and the film's avoidance of the Lillehammer incident, and indeed the fact that its protagonists never truly cross the line in any of their actions tends to make it far more partisan than its makers believe. But the strengths far outweigh the flaws. Easily the best of this year's Best Picture nominees, it goes to great lengths to humanize its targets, and does so without the kind of speechifying that constantly stopped Black Sunday in its tracks. Despite the effort, it still ends up less about the moral quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict and more a film about the dehumanising effect on the film's righteous killers as skirted issues of moral doubt give way to the very paranoia they earlier joked about. Not that the politics aren't raised - Black September retaliation for the killings leads one of the squad to comment ""We're in dialogue"" while the much-criticized staircase scene does at least remain true to the characters by having THEIR dialogue limited to their own equally narrow perceptions - but the film's real ambiguity is more psychological than political or even moral. Even when the hunters become the hunted and the possibility that they're informers are also informing on them, the film avoids black and white answers: while two Israelis are definitely killed by a team hunting the assassination squad, a third is much more doubtful.

It's a fine piece of filmmaking, too, despite the odd mis-step, never feeling its 164-minute length and throwing in some excellent moments of tension as the inexperienced killers botch their way through their hit list. The period reconstruction is generally excellent (it has the look of Frankenheimer's French Connection II had it been shot in Scope, and makes equally good use of French actors), there's the Devil in the details (beds catching fire after being machine-gunned, the ever-changing kitchens in the showroom window that Avner looks longingly at as his home life becomes a faded memory, the glimpse of the twin towers in the final scene) and the characters genuinely look like they inhabit that era - indeed, Mathieu Almaric's murky underworld figure even looks like a younger Roman Polanski circa The Tenant.

It also showcases the perfect choice for the new James Bond - though since Eric Bana wasn't interested, Daniel Craig turned out to be an excellent alternative, here giving delivering a convincingly blokeish 70s Afrikaaner. But despite mostly strong ensemble performances, it's really Bana's show, and he responds with an impressively intelligently physical performance - first seen clenching and unclenching his fist as he watches TV coverage of the massacre, desperate to do something, posture ramrod straight when he accepts the mission but ultimately shrinking within himself as it takes its psychological toll. Spielberg's best in years, and his first film with a decent ending in more than a decade, it deserved a better reception than it found.

It's 1972.  Munich is hosting the Olympics.  One evening, Palestinian terrorists have captured the 11 Israeli athlectics and murdered them.  This has come to be known as Black September.

Shortly afterwards, the Israelis have decided on vengeance.  Anver and his team of men have been stripped of their identities and sent off on missions to assassinate those involved in the Black September massacre.  These men are not professionals in assassinations and weaponry.  However, they learned and improvised quickly to succeed in their missions.

For someone not well versed in history of tension between Israel, Palestine and Arabic countries might assume that this what started the whole thing.  No additional information is provided these tensions.  So, the whole thing seems to be ""out of the blue"".  Perhaps, it was.

Nonetheless, *Munich* is a long movie.  A long movie about vengeance with mission planning.  These missions are nothing ""high action"" like Mission Impossible.  They're simply and to the point.

Maybe you'll like this type of historical movies, dealing with terrorism of the past.  For me, this was something that I could've been satisfied with an hour-long documentary on PBS or the History Channel.  Nothing in this film truly captured my attention.",1169769600,4,1496,5.124481327800829
1541245,3,B00005JOIH,"What really bugs me about movies ""inspired"" or ""based on"" real life events, is that the producers take that real-life event, and then fictionalize it into something unrecognizable.  If people don't research what they've seen, they go away thinking ""this is how it happened"".  Spielberg, at least is honest when he says the ""facts"" are that there was a terrorist attack in Munich, the Israeli government decided to retaliate, and some of those terrorists were indeed killed.  Beyond that, most of this movie is fiction.

The intelligence sources used to track down the targets were not the quasi organized crime characters depicted in the film.  Apparently, much of the information came from Israeli Intelligence.  Why the change?  There's probably more drama in some shadowy trans-national organization.  Some people perceive some sort of ""balance"".  I suppose it depends upon one's perspective.  If one cannot differentiate a terrorist act like the massacre in Munich from a government taking measures (albeit extreme) to protect it's citizens from future attacks, then I suppose that individual could interpret things like the overdone depiction of personal trauma suffered by the team members as a message against direct retaliation.  Although most people would have difficulty killing someone in cold blood, I doubt that the actual Mossad trigger-pullers had the misgivings depicted in the film.

The message that killing a terrorist only causes another to step forward is flawed.  The same would be true with capture and trial.  The Israelis have used every method imaginable, ranging from direct negotiation, to capture and trial, to assassination.  The fact is that these groups want what won't be given...the elimination of Israel as a nation.  The only alternative for Israel (and us too) is to fight, making the price of terrorism ever higher for it's perpetrators.  This is not a purely military issue.  In some cases, it is practical to capture, try in open court, and imprison.  In others, the only way to eliminate a threat is to go out and kill it.  Yes, others will probably step forward, but they will not be as skilled or experienced, and may at least be impeded by the knowledge that they have to live in constant fear, or at least concern, for their own safety.  There doesn't seem to be much room for moral hand wringing when the alternative is one's own destruction.",1169683200,23,2388,5.0717948717948715

A predator cannot live in a society; by nature they are solitary and removed. The reason they kill is really neither here nor there since the whole thing is an aberration of reality. Thus, when Israel sent normal people to behave as predators to find predators and kill them we get to see a natural breakdown in their thinking and the fear that results from performing (what is for them) an unnatural act. I agree with the movies end; catch them and bring them to trial in the same manner Nazi criminals were handled. To become a killer to catch a killer makes no sense and will only produce another round of the same kind of thinking.",1169510400,4,865,4.446540880503145

Spielberg tries to remain in equilibrium on a very sensitive issue...

In this movie Spielberg weaves a story around those two basic facts that give us an intense story line of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate all eleven Palestinians to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of eleven Israeli athletes. The director seems to focus on the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it.

My brother had worked as a volunteer at those Olympics so we were close to the tragedy. And it was a horrible tragedy. But knowing of the Mossad, I doubt this is realistic. Also I doubt their chosen agents would be this incompetent. And the sex scenes in the movie serve no purpose as is stated elsewhere. Other then that it is an OK action film.

I was a child during the Munich atrocity and was intrigued by Spielberg's effective portrayal of the event.  That was 5 stars worth of film-making.  Too bad he botched up the rest so badly.  The actors did a great job with a very naive and sappy script.  I don't think Spielberg could've fit another second of mournful Jewish violin music in.  Let me say straight out that I am not Jewish and have much sympathy for the Palestinians.  However, I am also a staunch believer in the pursuit of truth in all things.  And I was AMAZED that Spielberg did a backward limbo for the Palestinian TERRORIST cause so extreme he had to almost be a contortionist.  Bad people on both sides of the conflict take advantage of the chaos for their own benefit.  The fact that these people don't seem to honestly see peace as a goal is much of the great tragedy of the conflict IMHO.  Good people, both Israelis and Palestinians, are trapped in the vice in between.  Spielberg portrayed every Palestinian victim as either a possibly mistaken target, a very sweet friendly fellow who had no choice but to POSSIBLY be a terrorist or a young tortured Palestinian idealist who probably could quote Nietzsche and be a great buddy.  If I were an Israeli, I would never let Spielberg enter the country again!  Even I find his message in the film to be pro-terrorist, i.e. the Israelis kind of deserved what they got (and deserve what they get today).  There is an element of truth in that Israeli actions spurred retaliations but saying that the guys who come to the fore to murder innocent civilians in the name of the cause are all a bunch of superior intellectuals is a bunch of crap.  I was disgusted by the end of this movie and started fast-forwarding more and more as it went along!  If I were Israeli or a Jewish Zionist, I think my head would have exploded off my neck.  And if I were Palestinian I would have been happy to find out Mossad was full of part-time, inexperienced, non-expert idiots with no international network to speak of.  Spielberg may be good as a director but he should stick to fantasy films.  I'm starting to think SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a fluke or he has a great staff who covered for him.

How this was done, who did it, and where everything happened was something Steven Spielberg tried to establish for the viewer.  Remember JFK?

This is another of those movies that grays the area between fact and fiction, reality and speculation.  I doubt that the team leader of the Israel assassins was so obsessed with the victims at Munich.  In reality, he would probably have been more focused on those he killed, and the families he destroyed.  This is the nature of war, and post-traumatic shock.

1541299,5,B00005JOIH,"Of all of Spielberg's serious films, the ones that get the most attention are Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. The former was a masterpiece, a true testament that he's more than a blockbuster director responsible for directing Jaws and Jurassic Park. The latter was an unflinching look into war during World War II but I preferred Schindler's List better. That is until Munich where sure it didn't have the impact of the other 2 but as overall film, I find myself wanting to watch this again which is rare since the other 2 didn't even do that. While it does have its problems, the story and the filmmaking talent on hand prove to me Munich should've won Best Picture.

The story is based on one of those ""it could've happened/might not have happened"" stories so it's purely speculative and dramatized. During the 1972 Olympic Games, terrorists held athletes of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. Eventually all 11 were killed so the government wanted those responsible brought to justice. They get Avner, the Prime Minister's former bodyguard, to lead the way with a team of 4 to track down those responsible. What they find though is that this is not a battle easily won and there's more on the line than just casualties.

After shooting the cool-but-immensely-flawed War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg jumped right in and shot Munich incredibly quickly. The result was an incredibly captivating look into how we try to fix the world's heavy problems but finding it too difficult to know when it'll end. The fact it's not an incoherent mess is one thing, but the fact it's to me one of his best films is quite a feat. You can always count on him to have memorable images and certain scenes, such as a scene entirely in silence is riveting while a transition from a bullet-riddled wall to rain against a window is just as great.

The casting is quite dead-on too with the standout being Eric Bana. He had the right idea with Hulk but it was probably just the direction for that movie but here he seems quite tortured but then you see someone get back some of that humanity he feels he's losing when his daughter calls him ""daddy"". We also have the current Bond Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz (the boyfriend in Amelie) as well as Geoffrey Rush who plays Avner's ""handler"" in a way. Also some attention to little-known Ayelet Zorer playing Avner's wife.

One thing that's been increasingly in popularity is the dual releases where we have just the bare-bones version, usually with awful cover art while we have the 2-disc special/collector/ultimate edition but oddly Munich was barely made available. While I can still find Lemony Snickett or War of the Worlds, Munich didn't seem like a lot of copies were sent out, in fact most stores hadn't even heard of them here. So if this one is what you want, either hunt like mad or just order online since it's a worthwhile one to get, unless they forgot to put something and they'll be a super edition later on.

Probably won't have the massive acclaim and staying power of Schindler and Private Ryan in public's eye but this is one film that I wouldn't pass up.",1166832000,,3116,4.689213893967093

1541399,4,B00005JOIH,"Having lived through the coverage of the slaughtered Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, I felt like I was experiencing the actual events as they were occurring over again.  Speilberg did an excellent job using stock news footage from the tragedy and overlaying actors into recreated scenes.  Though these events are actually shown piecemeal throughout the film, the actual story is about what transpired afterwards.  The Israeli government hired a hit squad to track down and eliminate 11 individuals that participated in the planning of the terrorist action at the Olympics.

This is based on an actual operation that the Mossaud carried out but obviously is Speilberg's fictionalized version of how it was done.

Eric Bana is a German/Jewish Israeli Mossaud operative who is chosen to lead the group of 5 mercenaries as they hunt down the perpetrators throughout Europe.  It is interesting how this Australian actor is able to change his accent at will to fit the roles that he is playing.

Bana is torn to do the mission because his wife is expecting the birth of their first child and the secret mission means that he must risk his life and possibly not see his wife till the mission is complete which could take years.

As the movie goes along Bana's personality starts to change from a gung-ho good government employee to someone who questions what he is doing and is constantly looking under his bed and phone for hidden bombs.

The movie moves along at a fast pace and you keep thinking you are seeing real events as they happen.  Sometimes it is a little complicated to understand what is going on (that is the value of having the DVD to be able to understand what you may have missed the first time).

Look for the actor who plays the new Bond in the main supporting role.  There is also an interesting sequence shot on the Queens side of New York City (supposedly taking place in 1973) where I was looking to see buildings that did not exist at the time and you do see the World Trade Center (I am assuming the scene was shot after 2001).",1163548800,8,2057,4.667590027700831

a problem many directors have today. Why do all of today's big movies have to run nearly three hours?Spielberg could have cut half an hour,and the film would have been much better. But the biggest problem is that Spielberg,Kushner,and Roth have really stacked the deck for Israel here.

The story is entirely one-sided. There is an excellent scene where the Arab

1541487,4,B00005JOIH,"Stephen Spielberg is one of our time's greatest directors.  The fact that he can balance out a real artistic vision while remaining unashamedly mainstream is truly remarkable.  Still, in movie after movie there is a groan-point.  A character will make a speech, or a scene dripping with sentimentality intrudes into what up that point has been a nearly perfect film (Schindler's List is a prime example, Saving Private Ryan also has its moments).  After so many years of watching Spielberg efforts however, I'm throwing in the towel.  Spielberg, I'm convinced, doesn't do this out of calculation; it's who he is:  an American director who loves nostalgia and sentiment.  And to be honest, to see the alternative is easy enough to do.  Spielberg is not David Lynch - a great, but weird, director.  No, he's Main Street without the teeming dark corners.  Oh, there's darkness with Spielberg, but light as well, and Hope.

So where does that leave Munich?  I think in a pretty good place.  The only ""speech"" that I heard, the kind that Spielberg cannot resist, popped up at the two hour mark, and it was pretty brief.  Something about revenge being endless.  (Still, I confess I'm mystified by those critics who have damned this movie because of its ambiguity.)  As usual, with Spielberg, great actors and performances, and a pretty fast moving movie for being close to three hours.  It grabs you from the first moment. My only real criticism is the way Spielberg chose to unveil the Munich massacre.  Dramatically it didn't seem to serve much purpose, since the event is unveiled in bits and pieces, with the climax (no pun intended) revealed while the chief Israeli assassin makes anguished love with his wife.  That just seemed weird - and not in a good David Lynch sort of way.  Just clunky.  I think a straightforward telling of the Munich attack would of worked just as well.

I think this is a classic case of can't-seperate-movie-from-sensitive-history syndrome which is a shame because the film is truly awful. The plot is confused and hard to follow (the use of flashbacks makes no sense), there is no pace or intrigue and it is far too long. Worst of all, Spielberg wasted some fine acting talent (Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush et al) on a script that is impossible to understand.

I think Spielberg's mistake was to follow the book too closely. There are too many unrelated scenes and the movie format (even at 2h 40m) doesn't allow for all the supporting information you need to make sense of them. Characters appear and disappear, locations change but the sets seemingly don't. The only scene that was exciting to watch was the one in which the assassins were thwarted by a removals van and an innocent young girl - but this was one short scene among several dozen.

1541489,5,B00005JOIH,"It is poignantly fitting that the man who directed Schindler's List should book-end that tale of Jewish pain with MUNICH, a film that tells another side of this people's struggle to survive in a period when the Jews have a state and the ability to answer with something more than simple suffering.

Spielberg claims that the good storyteller exercises 'empathy in every single direction', a project that raises howls whenever it is applied to the Israel-Arab conflict. Or, as this film styles it with historical accuracy, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the same dry grove of the fathers' olive trees.

Supported by star turns  from Eric Bana, Moshe Ivgy, and Michael Lonsdale and a haunting sequence in which Lynn Cohen plays an anguished Golda Meir - forced to the conclusion that 'every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values' - Spielberg's MUNICH manages to focus on the human drama played out by the soul of avengers everywhere. In the wake of the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Bana's Avner is drafted as the unlikely lead agent of Meir's decision to prove that Israel must 'forget peace for now ... we have to show them that we are strong.'

Avner carries out his role with taciturn determination, yet his eyes go moister and home calls the more compellingly as he scratches names off the list of eleven Palestinians who must be eliminated in order to show just how costly it is to mess with Israel.

That 'family matters' is an affirmation of relative priorities kept by all parties in this film is a theme that Spielberg returns to at measured intervals. In the meantime, Avner and his team of avengers find themselves increasingly struggling with 'the mice inside your skull'. Resolution comes in the end through family itself. But it is a resolution that leaves stained, limping men, not the 'neat, durable men' whom Prime Minister Meir confesses to admiring in the film's early minutes.

This is a film that must be seen by those who care about those conflicts that are fought in memory of the fathers, not least the one that still rages and promises to rage on in a small slice of land just to the east of the Mediterranean Sea.

Spielberg has told the tale with astonishing evenness, though it is possible that this conclusion can only be reached from the more or less comfortable distance of this reviewer.  Empathy - even that which the director claims to have exercised 'from ever single angle' - hardly seems a virtue to the true-to-life antagonists of this particular conflict.

1541490,5,B00005JOIH,"Spielberg's latest MASTERPIECE proves once again why he's one of my favorite directors. It clocks in at over 2 and half hours. It's an objective, methodical look into the mechanics of assassination and it's effects on the pysches or souls of the patriotic. It is a brutal thriller, but an intelligent one that may wear down those viewers with less patience.

11 Israeli athletes are murdered at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich Germany by a terrorist group calling itself Black September. 5 Israeli men are quickly assembled, their identities erased by the Israeli intelligence agency MOSSAD, and sent on a mission to assassinate those responsible. (Even though the events from the book were relayed to the author by the team leader Avner, played by Eric Bana, the rest of the film is considered by most to be fiction. Including MOSSAD. This has spawned almost as much controversy as Oliver Stone's JFK.) Information on the whereabouts of the Palestinian leaders of Black September is gathered from a shadowy French family with no ties to any political doctrine or government. ""We don't work for governments."" (I expect this a lie. What other form of information gathering is there, except cladestine information gathering for governments? Or corporations? And anyone in the intelligence business knows that corporations are governments. A possible hole in Avner's story? Maybe he's covering up methodology in his story and protecting informants. It's not possible to trust everthing you read from an ex-spook. Everything depends on their motives and loyalties. These guys spew a lot of disinformation. From what I've gathered from my reading about cladestine Black Ops, the informants were most likely Arab, the information would have come from multiple contacts, and would probably have been passed over through the Agency. But, deep cover also means adapting your own informants with very little agency contact. I must assume the French informants could be real and that they are lying.) Be that as it may, the Israeli assassins pay extravagant sums of money for this information and their identities as Israeli agents are unknown to their informants. Soon the men are taken through European locales such as Italy, France, and Greece to eliminate those responsible for Munich, with the use of guns and explosives. Eventually, with a fullscale raid on a terrorist compound in Beirut. The assassinated terrorist leaders for Black September, who are under the auspices of the KGB and may or may not be under the auspices of the CIA, are quickly being replaced and the political affiliations of the Israeli agents are eventually brought to light. The Israeli agents then discover that information about them is also being given to the other side. And it may or may not be coming from the shadowy French. A very real scenario in the shadow world. Soon, paranoia sets in and no one is who they seem. And people are dying on both sides. Violence and retribution beget violence and retribution. A neverending cycle. During all of this the characters are forced to question the very nature of their own souls. This film poses the question, ""Is revenge a worthy act if you are a civilized people and you have been attacked?"" But being true to it's objectivity, it never answers that question. Our emotional ties to our identities are what doom us as a species. This is my own observation, not Speilberg's.

Superb acting(along with English, you'll hear German, Italian, French, and Arabic being spoken), exotic European locales, objective portrayals of both sides of the conflict(can anyone really sympathize with terrorists? Here, we understand their frustration, but never their actions), an intriguing and timely story, suspenseful music, brutal realism, and great cinematography make this a MASTERPIECE of the genre and one of the BEST films of 2005 along with being one of the most IMPORTANT films ever made. It's surely one of the BEST in Spielberg's amazing library of films.

The film has an excellent plot and very good tricks on the way which make it a fine thriller, but also tries to give a very personal and human view of the grave problem of terrorism and how this new kind of warfare eats away the souls of friends and enemies alike. Of course he does not avoid to follow mainly the Israeli view of the subject but through an encounter by chance he presents also the arguments of the ""other side of the hill"". The final closing picture which focuses on the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center as they were in the 70s, is an indirect but stark reminder to the American people that Israel's long war against ""terrorism"" has now become their war also.",1156204800,5,860,4.519230769230769
1541493,5,B00005JOIH,"I'm not a big fan of ""inspired by true events"" films, mainly because it can be impossible to distinguish truth from dramatic license at any given moment, but Munich represents the genre at its best.  It's an important movie because the events of this story lie beneath the surface for those of us who are too young to have actually watched the drama play out back in the summer of 1972.  We hear references to it every four years during the Summer Olympics and think about how awful it must have been, but I don't think I ever read or heard the whole story - especially Israel's actions in response to the kidnapping and murder of eleven of their Olympic athletes in Munich.  The Israeli government's determination to mete out justice to the terrorists responsible for the plot easily lend themselves to questions on ethics, morals, and the like - and this aspect of the story really becomes the centerpiece of this motion picture.

The Munich massacre is one of the real lynchpins in the history of Islamic terrorism.  When a group of Palestinian terrorists calling themselves Black September (and aligned with Yassir Arafat) infiltrated the Olympic Village in Munich, held eleven Israeli athletes hostage, and eventually slaughtered them all in the midst of an incompetent German rescue attempt, the Palestinians succeeded in attracting world attention to their cause.  Germany soon handed the terrorists another major victory, cowardly releasing the three terrorists arrested (the others were killed) for the crime in acquiescence to the demands of other terrorists (hijackers in this case).  Seeing that no justice would be forthcoming in European courts, Golda Meir gave a green light to a daring plan to kill the eleven most prominent planners of the massacre.  This is the dramatized story of five men who gave up their own identities to serve their country in Operation Wrath of God.

The film centers around the team leader, Avner (Eric Bana), and the emotional effect this operation had on him as the mission advanced from one target to another.  The whole group of Mossad agents was something of a motley crew, as none of them had the kind of qualifications I would expect of assassins charged with such a dramatic mission.  Director Stephen Spielberg did a fantastic job of generating real tension in the moments leading up to each assassination attempt, and then made each hit as violently realistic as possible.  Still, I do think the plot has some shortcomings.  Early on in particular, I sometimes missed a connection between one scene and another; for example, I'm still a little hazy on exactly how Avner struck up his relationship with his main informer.  Likewise, I have to believe it could never be so surprisingly easy to gain access to a target's residence in order to set up a given hit.

At two hours and forty-five minutes, some will say that Munich is too long and that it drags in spots, and I can see some viewers questioning the nature of the film's final twenty minutes or so.  Those later scenes are very important, though, as they basically transform the film from a suspenseful action flick to a deep and almost philosophical examination of good and evil, personal responsibility, ethics, and the like.  When you're an assassin, you just don't put everything you've seen and done behind you after the fact.  Avner is truly haunted by his own actions, seeking some kind of assurance that he had done the right thing.  The whole presentation manages to magically walk a line between the competing ideologies of the Palestinians and the Israelis, asking tough questions of each side and examining events from both perspectives.  Whereas an Oliver Stone would have politicized this story up to its eyeballs, Spielberg keeps the film surprisingly objective in its presentation.

Besides a grim reminder that terrorism is by no means a new phenomenon, Munich finds ready application to the lively debates of the present day.  The questions surrounding this story are the same kinds of questions being asked today in Western society (partly because we've let this cancer of the body politic fester for decades).  That is what makes this film especially important.",1156204800,3,4191,4.9557142857142855
1541494,5,B00005JOIH,"The violence is part of the human nature. Gaston Bouthoul' s impressive  essay published in the early seventies brings us forth interesting information; the major interval of peace along the mankind's history has been of two hundred years and along the 5000 years of history there just have been 400 years of absolute peace. The conclusion is more than obvious. The peace is a nostalgic idea, a marvelous product of the syncretism, conceived as the final sum of fragmented hopes, and has nothing to do with the human race. And Voltaire's acidic statement: ""The civilization doesn't suppress the incivility, it just improves it.""

If you expected just an incendiary movie, take your time and make a pause on the road. Spielberg' s approach turns around the slow and progressively psychological fragmentation of every one of the components of the apparently epic team that were hired to exterminate one by one the eleven intellectual leaders hat planned the unforgettable massacre in Munich 1972.

So, under the perspective of more than thirty four years, the movie is a very zealous examination - told in documental style, through dramatic narrative ellipsis - around the dreadful events which took place with all the possible crudeness.

According these established premises this handful of men will be hired in order to search and eliminate around every corner of Europe one by one the eleven terrorists. Despite certain inconsistencies in the script, we will witness how every one of the members of the Quintet simply will give up with such violence amount.

Our main hero - Avner Kauffman - is happily married and his Jewish ancestors impede him to understand the huge challenge that this operation means. At the end he refuses to continue in this operation and he has realized the shed blood will not redeem the fallen victims; and on the other hand the violence is endless, that's why he simply decides to stop and initiate a new life with his wife and beautiful daughter in the Bronx. Ironically, in the final shot the fixed camera shows us the World Trade Center.

No terrorism has philosophical justification. On the other hand the violence has no face, walks with velvet steps in order to select randomly some place in the world to make his designs come true. So under these coordinates, you fight against an invisible enemy, masked and hidden under the most unexpected conditions and keeping this paranoid state in the most people.

Maybe this pacific statement in the final dialogue, advocating for the irrationality of this bloody revenge, was very brief leaving in the spectator's taste an unfinished anguish and a lot of unanswered questions. Perhaps this was the final intention; to make us understand the no sense of the revenge, but this is simply the edge of the iceberg. Don' t you?",1155945600,7,2801,4.959488272921109

1541576,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg scores again.  One might initially look at this film as an advocacy for revenge.  It isn't.

The story takes place after ""Black September"" in which Israeli hostages were killed during the Munich Olympic games.  It is about an elite team of Israeli assassins who are charged with finding the masterminds behind Black September and eliminating them.  It is a story about revenge.

Eric Bana delivers a powerful performance as Avner, an Israeli man who appears to be enjoying the life he is living with his young wife who is pregnant with their child.  Avner is recruited and asked to perform a difficult task for the sake of the country of Israel.

Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is the Israeli who is in charge of making sure that Avner is able to carry out his duty as well as providing him with four other men as well as unlimited funds to acquire the necessary intelligence concerning the whereabouts of the men they're supposed to kill.

Avner finds, initially, that the first couple of targets are difficult to carry out for him, especially emotionally.  He all but panics when he realizes that the young daughter of one of his targets has gone back inside the apartment (since they've agreed not to kill civilians).

At first it seems that Avner and his team are having no trouble finding and eliminating their targets thanks to the help of Louis (Mathieu Almaric) and his father (Michael Lonsdale).  But then, one of the members of his own team is found dead in the bed of a woman who has obviously been hired to kill him.  Avner quickly realizes that the hunters have quickly become the hunted.  One by one members of his team are killed.  At first this compells him to kill those responsible as well as the men responsible for Black Sunday.

Avner soon reaches a state of paranoia and distrust.  He doesn't know if Louis and his father have sold him out.  He doesn't know if the Israeli government may be behind it as well.  He soon finds himself sleeping the closet of his hotel room and longing to return to his wife and daughter who are living in New York.

Avner concludes that the killing can never stop.  He finally understands that he, himself, will never be rid of the fear that he might be killed some day as well.  He realizes that vengeance only begets more vengeance.  Ephraim all but acknowledges this, even though he tries to reassure Avner of the ""great work"" he's done for his country.  Avner can no longer view it in these terms, as he doesn't even feel it is safe to return to Israel.

One of the most compelling shots in this film is at the very end.  As I stated earlier, this film is about the dangers and sickness of ""vengeance.""  Spielberg ends the film with a shot of the two towers of the World Trade Center.  In his own way, he is stating that no amount of vengeance is justifiable.  Because, where does it end?  Avner realizes that for every person he's killed, more have risen to take their places.  In his heart, he understands that it causes only pain, and mostly to himself.

Munich is a powerful, important film, which says a lot about the world we live in...because it doesn't have to be that way.",1154736000,2,3148,4.5462633451957295

""Munich"" is about terrorism, hatred, revenge, and survival. Having withstood the slaughter of eleven athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Israel retaliates by mounting clandestine operations to punish the twelve complicit Arabs. Israeli leadership is intent upon extracting justice by punishing her foes; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

The price paid to have it is often to steep. Those Israelis that set out to have revenge on the terrorist paid a high price. I am sure Spielberg did everything possible to tell most of the story about how the Munich terrorist where tracked and assasinated. You can argue politics and religion all you like about who is treated unfairly, the movie is done superbly. Spielberg is a fine director that knows what needs to be told and how to keep the story from being to complex and muddled. He doesn't go into all the minutiae as some directors have done of late.

Well, I, for one, beg to differ in that the director has taken a controversial story and given us a film that doesn't show either side as being the ""hero"" or the ""villain.""

Though much of the world condemned the actions of Black September on that dark day in Munich, the ""speculation"" of the retaliatory actions of Israel could equally have been criticized.  As depicted here, the pursuit of the assassins is relentless with a cast of wonderful actors displaying the various personas of a ""hit squad.""

Eric Bana deserved an Oscar nomination as the assassin with a concious while co-star Daniel Craig is memorable as Bana's partner-in-arms with a penchant for R & B music.  Craig shows a menacing air that might do him well as he takes on the role of ""James Bond"" in the forthcoming ""Casino Royale.""

Geoffrey Rush gives another outstanding performance as the man that sends Bana and company on their mission.  Ciaran Hinds, Mathier Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler are equally impressive as the remaining three members of the quintet.  Michael Lonsdale and Mathier Amalric shine as the father-son team that provides information for the Israelis at a very expensive cost.

Spielberg's direction has never been tighter and the location filming and cinematography is flawless.  Tense moments abound with realistic situations, especially when the ""best laid plans"" go awry.

Spielberg stalwart John Williams provides an extremely subdued score, never overshadowing the on-screen events.

According to the film there is a family that is like a freelance intelligence network.  So the Israelis pay them for the whereabouts of the Palestinians.

In background the rest of the world's(naturally since everyone in the world is anti-semitic) intelligence agencies are trying to stop the Israelis because they all have an interest in Black September.  The villains are the Russians, MI5 and the CIA.  The CIA at one point prevent the Israelis from making a hit.

The Israeli Government in turn assembles a group of covert agents to track down and assassinate those responsible for the killings of their olympic athletes by any means necessary.

1541662,1,B00005JOIH,"This film is based on real events, except the audience should have been warned that the film is ""Very, Very, Very Loosely Based on Real Events.""  Anyone who has read the book ""Vengeance,"" which this movie gets its information from, will find themselves very perplexed.  Steven Spielberg has only reproduced approximately 90 percent of the book's content for the audience.

Five Israeli anti-terrorists are given a mission to hunt down and kill eleven men who were involved in the 1972 Olympic Munich Massacre.  However, many of the events protrayed in the movie hardly have any resemblance to the actual happenings.  In one episode, a terrorist is killed in a hotel room by an explosive device placed under his mattress.  In the film, after the bomb explodes, a honeymooning couple next door are staggering around in shock, covered in dust, half-naked, and the young wife is crying that she cannot see.  In reality, the damage was limited to the terrorist's room and the couple was never injured.

Another bomb, which had been placed in a telephone, explodes with lots of noise and damage.  In reality, however, this bomb barely cracked a pane of window glass.

This continues on throughout the film.  In the film, the leader of the team, Avner, and his second, Carl, seemed to have little knowledge about the men they are supposed to kill, and sometimes wonder if the men on the death list are worthy of their penalty.  Again, in reality, Avner and Carl received lengthy briefings about each man on the list, were given all of the information the Mossad had, and then Avner and Carl briefed the rest of the members of the team.

I could go on and on.  What was Spielberg thinking?  Was there not enough drama in the real events?  Spielberg has two characters in the film shot in full, frontal nudity.  The only problem I have with this is that IT NEVER HAPPENED!  If Spielberg had read the book, which he claims he had, he would have known that one of these characters was covered by a sheet and the other was wearing a bathrobe.

I give this film one star because it is not bad as films go.  However, in willfully ignoring the historical facts in making this film, Spielberg has done a disservice to the audience, and an even greater disservice to the men whose story this film is based on.",1153440000,17,2292,4.654228855721393
1541663,3,B00005JOIH,"This messy film erupts onto the screen with a series of confusing and fast-paced images.  Those not familier with the 1972 Masscare and events follwoing it will get quickly lost trying to follow this muddled epic.  Scenes change from one locale to the next, and the sequencing of events is never made very clear.  There is also more than a bit of heavy-handed propaganda here.

Obviously the Isrealis are the absolute good guys in this saga. The Arabs are all one-dimensional terrorists, which provides for simplistic good vs. evil and your basic revenge thriller.  While the massacre of the athletes was a terrible tragedy, Isreal certainly was (and is) no innocent player in a series of bloody events that go back to that troubled nation's creation in 1947.  This film seems a throw-back to some of the outrageously pro-Isreali films that came out back in the 1970s.  Even Isreali cinema today has a more realistic portrayal of thmselves in current events than Hollywood seems to have.  But of course Speilberg wants to show loyality to his creed and does so with a heavy-hand here.

We have all sorts of soulful statements in this film that are obviously meant for Jewish viewers to consume. Some are quite biased.  I didn't find this film to be very even-handed in the politics.  Golda Meir comes across like a Jewish mother from Brooklyn wanting to put her good Isrealis through lawyers' school, but first must kill a bunch of Arabs in order to do so!  The Arabs all come across as one dimensional murderers, which they no doubt mostly are.  The thing about the Arab-Isreali conflict is that both parties are so unlikeable!  The attempt is made here to vilify one, and portray the other as innocent.  Both parties are to blame if we look at the actual history.

The British had their hands full with these two semetic brothers during their Mandate years in Palestine and could barely keep them from killing each other then.  Is it any surprise today that they both wish to continue this tradition of killing over that distant, dusty,  biblical land.

What makes this movie so popular despite its tedious and far too long length is its relevance to today's problems.  The end showing the World Trade Center in the background is a simplistic attempt at symbolism by Speilberg, trying to reward us for watching a dreadfully long opus with often no clear direction.

1541665,4,B00005JOIH,"Munich is the story about a secret Israeli squad sent out to track down and asassinate 11 targets who were believed responsible for the 1972 killing spree of 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics by Palestinian terrorists, a group known as Black September.

 The Israeli government hires a man named Avner [Eric Bana] to lead a team of 4 away from their families for months, maybe even years till their mission is complete. They will have to sacrifice their own well being as they venture into hostile territory as they track down their targets. At first Avner and his men are relaxed as they think it will be done in a couple of months, however the stress of tracking down their targets start to take a toll on themselves.

Geoffrey Rush co-stars as Ephraim, the team handler. He sort of just hung around to check on the team's progress and also supplied them the money they needed to bribe people into helping them with their mission. Also in the movie is a paid French informant who supplies the names of the targets but also does not earn the trust of the full team as some question whether he is really helping them or not.

The plot takes the team all over the Middle East, even areas such as France and London. There is also a lot of violent images such as brutal execution by the team members on their targets. They also show in flashbacks during the movie how the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists which aren't easy to see.

However Avner shows a lot of compasion as he sees his new daughter and wife for the first time after being separated for such a long time. I did find some scenes in the movie to drag a bit, but a lot of suspense as the team members prepare to eliminate their next target brought the level up a lot.

There aren't many extras on the DVD at all, although you do have the option of choosing to start the movie with a small introduction by Steven Spielberg himself as he talks about the story and how hard a subject it was to touch and make into a movie.

Even though the extras section is lacking this is a great movie to see. A lot of suspense and even some sentimental scenes in between make this well worth checking out.

And the attention to detail was totally dissapointing, particularly considering Spielberg is renowned for that. For example, Swiss Bank attendants, and Golda Meier, with an American accent?

We often forget that this is an on-going tragedy around the world and many are at a loss as to how to obtain a solution without becoming just like the terrorists. The film is a good fictional adaptation that was inspired by true events. Though some factual areas had to be a guessing game, it was very well put together.

1541698,4,B00005JOIH,"baby daughter...mazel-tov. We've killed another  terrorist...mazel-tov. So it goes. On the surface it's all so simple. The 11 Israeli atheletes to the Munich Olympics in 1972 were murdered by Black September. Israel will seek out & kill individuals who knew or were responsible. They have a list of leaders. The  Massad recruits agent Avner played by Eric Bana & a team of specialist to find them. There are rules. The Massad & Prime Minister Golda Meir, who is sitting right there, must have credible deniability. The team is stripped of their identity. They are not well known, anyway. The must do the killing only in Europe & must not kill any innocent bystanders. Expolsions are the preferred method of assassination. They seem to have  unlimited funds from $$$ stashed in Swiss safety deposit boxes. They are sucessful but not as they planned. They must kill point blank with guns. They travel unauthorized to Lebanon & many innocents are killed. They make a side trip to Amsterdam simply to kill a female assassin very graphically in cold blood for killing a team member. She had come on first to Avner who thought of his sweet wife & turned down a vist to her room. So it becomes apparent while he is seeking out & killing terrorist he is in turn being hunted also. He fears for his family & has them moved to from Israel to Brooklyn. It is very hard to believe in the beginning, that Avnar is a stone cold agent. He is a handsome, young, modest family man that any mother (except his own) could love. But Speilberg hasn't made a mistake in the casting. The killing does take it toll, emotionally on Avnar. Speilberg hasn't drawn the terrorist as evil, villians deserving to be killed. They are somtimes gentle, urbane, respected family men. They are even likeable. They must die. Avnar quits & joins his family in Brooklyn. His sanity is in doubt.

  In any case it doesn't matter. As soon as you kill a leader somone immediately rises to take their place. The more terrorist you kill, the more that sprout, like weeds. This is an above average thriller with little technical whiz bang. It has the additional virtue that some of it at least, is true.",1152576000,3,2158,4.650918635170604
1541699,4,B00005JOIH,"I remember this timeline faintly as a wee lad. So for that reason, along with the fact that most of Steven Spielberg's films are good, I decided to see this film.

Other than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, one of my all-time favorite war films, MUNICH didn't seem like the typical Spielberg film. No WAR OF THE WORLDS nor dinos here. But an assembly of assassins that one won't soon forget. Set in the early 70's, MUNICH takes one back to when terrorists first started making their appearance on American TV's.

Highly political, with intrigues and mysteries of various dark organizations, MUNICH takes you through a labyrinth of dark corridors throughout Europe and stains each one with blood.

With a rich ensemble cast, MUNICH is tightly well written, although some may be somewhat lost in the various long histories of the several peoples involved. But the main character, the leader of the assassins, played by The HULK's and TROY's Eric Bana, does a great acting performance here.

There is a lot going on in this film. Lots of action and intrigue. But most of all, it makes one look at the heart, perhaps the very root of the problems at several warring factions. If you have nearly 3 hours to kill, then this film is for you.

It is an important film.",1152144000,3,1249,4.659090909090909
1541700,4,B00005JOIH,"For starters, the makers of MUNICH assume viewers will possess a certain knowledge base about the tragedy of the 1972 Olympics. For younger viewers, the documentary ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER is a great way to get up to speed.

As for this movie, it's based on the book VENGEANCE, by George Jonas. That volume's verisimilitude has been questioned in some quarters. Given its subject, that's unsurprising. However, an NPR interview with a Mossad veteran kept sticking in my mind while watching MUNICH. The agent chuckled merrily at the notion of Israeli agents paying large sums of money for information, as opposed to just doing the intelligence gathering themselves.

So when MUNICH starts with the dreaded ""Based on real events"" tagline, I was already wondering if Spielberg just wanted both free artistic license and a certain credibility. But before I get in too deep here, let me hasten to say that this movie is quite well made and worth watching. Look elsewhere for plot details; for my part, I found the movie very interesting and pertinent.

SPOILER ALERT: Tony Kushner's screenplay adaptation explores the issues of conscience and doubt for our assassins, but particularly reprehensible was his intercutting of our protagonist making love to his wife with shots of Israeli athletes being slaughtered in Munich. That seemed gratuitous and sicko-sexual to this viewer.",1152057600,,1370,5.162162162162162
1541701,4,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg once again makes a thrilling and capable film. He is the ultimate master of timing and suspense; he never forgets the audience's need for a good story.

I regret, though, that I watched his introduction to the film (one of the options on the DVD) before viewing the film itself. He is bending over backwards to explain that this is not a political movie (i.e., no message here that could be construed as anti-Israel, anti-war). But really, I'm sorry, that's disingenuous, for this is obviously an anti-war movie. You only need to focus on the final frame, an endlessly long shot of the World Trade Center in New York, to appreciate this fact fully. Clearly, Spielberg has had a stomach full of violence in the name of peace and has made a protest film, the message of which is that killing breeds only more of the same and degrades the humanity of those recruited in its cause, however idealistic and decent they start out.

I think I would have admired the film more if I hadn't watched its director retract its obvious message beforehand. That he felt the need to do so simply underscores how tormented and fraught the current political situation has become.

Munich is also obviously a double-entendre, since it is both the birthplace of Hitler and the site of the terrorist attacks on the Israeli Olympic athletes. How much longer will the human race need to endure such evil cycles of violence? This is the sad question this dark and powerful film asks. Unfortunately, its maker has neither answers nor the courage of his own convictions.",1152057600,3,1560,4.749077490774908

1541705,4,B00005JOIH,"Realism at its most haunting, Munich is a multi-layered film addressing many issues. Although revenge is its central theme, an eye for an eye, the story is about nationalism, loyalty, the value of family and that thin line between killing in war and plain murder outside the so-called war arena.

The film begins in Munich during the Olympic games. As is well known to those who were living at the time, Palestinians stormed the Olympic village and took the Israeli team hostage. As the world watched the tragedy unfold on their television sets, most were hopeful that the outcome would be without bloodshed and death. As a child I remember distinctly staring at the television in a kind of shock, and after the hostages had been murdered, experiencing terrible nightmares for some time. To be sure, I was not alone with these feelings - this was not a movie but real death.

The film does an excellent job of representing this tragedy.

The scene changes and the Israeli Prime Minister is confronted with a difficult decision. Although bombing Palestinian villages in retaliation, somehow this was not enough, thus she gives the order to assassinate, one by one, the perpetrators directly responsible.

The Australian actor, Eric Bana, portrays the young Israeli solider who must disconnect from his home, his family and his government, acting as a rogue killer, however financed by the government. In other words, if he is caught, no country or government will take responsibility - like many undercover operatives one reads about, he is on his own. The reason for the covert operation is that it is illegal, against many international laws. The story moves on and he has a team of unusual characters, all loyal to the Israeli cause, to hunt down those responsible for Munich.

The settings are many - Rome, London, France, Athens and New York - all beautifully photographed.

What I found most astounding was the realism of the film; the killings felt too real, the fear, trepidation, guilt and sadness of all the characters felt palpable. The film's end is a wonderful piece of acting and writing.

Generally not a big fan of Spielberg films, this one was a visceral experience, lasting because of its realism and the important issues it raises. The central issue, the occupied territories, the never-ending murder and mayhem, leaves the viewer, not directly involved in that war, wondering when or if a reconciliation will ever occur.

A thinking film and superb in all respects.",1151625600,3,2484,4.954326923076923

1541776,4,B00005JOIH,"Despite the revenues that his films have produced, I believe Steven Spielberg is very overrated as a moviemaker.  It took me years to watch ""Jurassic Park""; and when I finally did, it has to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  Like the Emperor with no clothes in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, apparently no one has had the guts to tell Spielberg that it is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e, but it is.  It makes the ""King Kong"" movies look brilliant by comparison.  Also, his movie ""Gremlins"" has got to have given little kids horrible nightmares for years.

With respect to ""Munich,"" however, it was beautifully done.  When it was released, I did not wish to see it because I deemed it too political and depressing, although I watched it finally.  Spielberg is to be congratulated.  This and ""Schindler's List"" are the two finest films that he has made.  He dealt with this subject eloquently.

For every action, such as the killings in Munich, there is generally a reaction; and one message of this film is that such actions and reactions go on and on, and assume a life of their own, and never stop.  Also, the world of international espionage is murky at best, and truth and justice are often in the eye of the beholder.  Families are torn apart, and honor is illusive.

Spielberg paints an opaque picture, closer to the truth than is comfortable for many people.  It was worth waiting . . . and watching.",1151452800,2,1415,4.608
1541777,5,B00005JOIH,"In an age where terrorism and war are daily realities, where the appropriate responses--violence or pacifism?--are debated, ""Munich"" steps in as a morality play from recent history.  Although never answering the questions directly, it challenges us to consider the consequences and the individuals who play roles in the drama.

Spielberg established himself as a director with an eye for thrills, then took more serious turns with ""Empire of the Sun,"" ""Schindler's List,"" and so on.  ""Munich"" is perhaps his best and most complete amalgam of his abilities.  It is a thriller, but with the soul and mind and moral ambiguities of a John le Carre novel.

The movie starts with an overview of the terrorist attack during the 1972 Munich Olympics, then unfolds the details of that attack through later flashbacks and nightmares.  The driving heartbeat of this film is Israel's Golda Meir (played to perfection) and her landmark decision to stand against violence with violence.  Her political stance leads to teams of assassins moving across Europe to hunt down those responsible for a number of terrorist activities.  These teams become aware of their own shortcomings and of moral questions; they gain in proficiency, yet struggle with the laws of their own homeland and those written through the generations in their own hearts.  Ultimately, success and failure become gray areas, and each man discovers himself to be nothing more than a pawn in a much larger, ambiguous game.

Murder, sex, betrayal, and double-dealings are all part of the scenario, though Spielberg never uses them gratuitously.  The acting is fantastic, the scenes are tightly wound and effective, the cinematography is suitably drab and seventies-ish; but it's the cohesive direction that pulls it all together into a masterpiece.

1541780,5,B00005JOIH,"We're a long way from E.T. now. Stephen Spielberg takes a dramatic look at the revenge that (could have?) taken place following the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. While ""inspired by actual events,"" we don't know how much of what we are watching is true and how much is made up - a common problem with today's cinema, as well as today's news media. At the beginning of the film, in the optional intro by Spielberg, he says that certain facts (three to be exact) are indisputable. When a filmmaker or writer starts talking about ""indisputable facts,"" watch out. Regardless of what Spielberg says in his intro, and regardless of the facts, MUNICH is about the vanity of revenge: how there is no end to it because it only spawns more revenge, and reeks havoc on the souls of those involved in it. No wonder God said, ""Vengeance is mine; I will repay,"" and ""Turn the other cheek.""

Eric Bana (Troy) is superb as Avner, who must learn these lessons the hard way. He gives up life with his wife and new baby to travel the world, tracking down the 11 men that he has been led to believe were responsible for the massacres in Munich. He has four others with him, none of which have had any experience as assassins. He has a neutral contact man who sells him leads and equipment, ammo, etc. Together the team rigs telephones, TV's, beds, etc. with bombs, in order to take out their victims. Eventually, the hunters become the hunted, so that Avner, on the brink of despair, ends up sleeping in his closet, afraid that someone may have rigged his own phone, his own TV, his own bed.

At one point, Avner has a conversation with a Palestinian who, not realizing that Avner is Jewish, tells him that having a homeland is everything, and that if he understood that, he would have sympathies for the Palestinians rather than for the Israelis. Later, Avner's mother tells him how proud she is of him, because he has helped secure a place on earth for Israel. The irony is overwhelming. Avner himself has no home, no place on earth, because he's a man on the run.

In another conversation, Robert protests against all the blood they're spilling for Israel, and tells him, ""We're Jews, Avner. We're supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. That's Jewish. That's what I knew, that's what I was taught."" God promised Israel a place in heaven if they would follow His Law. Yet, in this movie, they are selling their souls, their ""righteousness,"" for a place on earth: more great irony. There are many spoken and unspoken truths in this film that warrant ferreting out.

The imagery in MUNICH is powerful. Avner loves cooking and often finds himself standing in front of a kitchen store, dreaming of the kitchen he may one day have. His contact man has a ""pappa"" who wants to meet with him, so Avner allows himself to be blindfolded and taken somewhere in the Italian countryside. Although it starts out ominously, it turns out to be a kind of holiday, full of children and sunshine, family and cooking - a stark contrast to the rest of the film. It turns out that Pappa is also a gourmet cook, and together they prepare a meal and develop a type of relationship. Pappa tells him that he and Avner are very much alike, ""tragic men, with butcher's hands but gentle souls."" As Avner is leaving, Pappa tells him, ""You could have been my son...but you're not. Remember that. We'll do business, but you aren't family."" Avner realizes that Pappa could just as easily sell his information to the other side as to him, since he has no loyalties. That's when he understands how little his life is worth, and how it can only end badly if he continues with his ""mission.""

There is some wonderful filmmaking in MUNICH. The cinematography is beautiful as well as gritty, John Williams score is powerful, and the script is taut. Across the board, the acting is superb, with Daniel Craig (Steve), Ciaran Hinds (Carl), Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert), Hanns Zischler (Hans) and Moritz Bleibtreu (Andreas) as standouts. Many of the images are disturbing, as this is very much an adult drama, with extreme violence as well as nudity - thus the R rating. It is not a feel good movie, but it is a think deep one.

1541781,3,B00005JOIH,"This was not a boxoffice smash as people just don't wish to be reminded of such calamity as happened at the 20th Olymiad in Germany in 1972.  Howard Cosell was there for ABC Sports and wrote a book about his involvement and the truth of the matter.  It all seemed like a bad dream.  There was terrible despair as it was kept out of the press as much as possible.  It was an echo of things past which sometime could be a precursor of things to come.

Sometimes instinct compels you to say certain things to a certain limit.  Is it Joe Allen or Carl Hampton to blame for those awful, awful selections.  Who has the temerity to take responsibility for such a continuing campaign.  I simply can't give either the benefit of a doubt as both are cruel and mean grudge holders.

1541783,3,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" is a fictionalized account of a secret Israeli mission to assassinate key leaders of the Palestinian Black September faction that was responsible for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany. The film is based on the 1984 book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas in which a former Israeli Mossad agent claiming to have been the leader of a squad that killed 7 Black September targets told his story. Mossad has never confirmed the story, and Jonas admits that it is impossible to know how much his source may have exaggerated, but director Steven Spielberg tracked the ex-Mossad agent down and was apparently satisfied that the gist of the story is true. The dialogue and characterizations are fictionalized for the movie, however, which makes me wonder why Spielberg cared so much about veracity.  ""Munich"" claims only to have been ""inspired by real events"", and that should be taken literally. Though these assassinations did take place, ""Munich"" alters motives and personalities so thoroughly to suit its themes that the film is essentially fiction.

After the world watches in horror as 11 Israeli hostages die at the hands of a group of Palestinians who had tried to use them to win the freedom of 200 imprisoned compatriots, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) decides that Israel should show its strength and avenge the deaths of its citizens. A Mossad security officer named Avner (Eric Bana) is assigned a team of 4 men, provided with a clandestine method of receiving funds, and given a list of 11 Palestinians living in Europe who are targets for assassination. The team is set adrift to carry out its mission, officially unacknowledged by Mossad. They move from nation to nation tracking down the targets, killing them, preferably with bombs, frequently turning to a mysterious information dealer (Mathieu Amalric) to locate the men on their list. But the violent deaths of prominent Palestinians in Europe doesn't go unnoticed. Anti-Israeli violence escalates, and the hunters become the hunted.

George Jonas hates ""Munich"", because he feels that Spielberg fails to distinguish between terrorism and counterterrorism. Palestinians may object to the implication that Mossad meted out justice to those who planned the Munich debacle, when actually the targets were prominent members of Black September who may or may not have had anything to do with Munich. The assassinations were intended to serve as a deterrent to future violence against Israelis. Steven Spielberg has said that his intention in ""Munich"" is to highlight the dilemmas and issues incumbent in fighting violence with violence, not to oppose that approach, but to caution that it is easy to get a bad result. He has invented conversations and radically altered personalities to that end which, unfortunately, leave Avner and his comrades without a shred of credibility. Avner is portrayed as a man nearly paralyzed by a crisis of conscience. His team members are contrived to represent different aspects of his conflicted psyche. But assassins do not have crises of conscience. They believe unfailing in what they do. The conversations that these men have reflect the internal dialogues of the filmmakers. But Mossad agents are not liberal Hollywood intellectuals. They don't think like that.

The characters aren't credible, and therefore the film isn't either. Avner's behavior doesn't even make sense within the context of the plot. He is the flakiest assassin ever. ""Munich"" is not so much morally ambiguous, even-handed, or provocative as it is simply muddy. It's so ineffective that Spielberg needed to explain his ideas in an introduction on the DVD. As to the film's relevance to anti-American terrorism today, it doesn't have any. Black September was a secular organization in a land dispute, much like the IRA, FLN, or Chechen separatists. Its leadership were educated, liberal, and pro-Western. Al-Qaeda are religious fanatics with no specific grievance and nothing to lose. Palestinians will think ""Munich"" gives the Israelis too much credit for scruples. Israelis will think that it posits a moral dilemma where none existed. The fact that ""Munich"" doesn't please either party doesn't make it a good film. Speilberg's ideas may be worth considering. But putting equivocation and moral anguish into the mouths of professional assassins is a lazy, unconvincing way to convey those ideas.

The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): There is an optional introduction by director Steven Spielberg (4 1/2 min) in which he talks about developing the film from the book ""Vengeance"", what parts of the story are indisputable, and his intentions with the film.

Not knowing much about the events of the Munich Olympic massacre, I wanted to see a drama that depicted the horrible tragedy and inform me of the reason it happened and what led up to it and thereafter.  It seems to me this movie made somewhat of a revenge spectacle of the tragedy.  The actors appeared ""James Bond-esqe"" and went about thier keystone cop theatrics with avengance.  Thier bloodlusting glory came easy with with no abandon and it made me feel like they were just as bad as the assasins that killed the Isreali athletes.  My oppinions are not to trivialize what happened.  I don't think the filmmakers intended to portray the ""heroes"" in this kind of light but the film ended up coming across like 007 meets Moses.  In my oppinion, I would have actors with a little more subtance and weight under thier belt.  Daniel Craig did not belong in this movie by the way.  He's not that great of an actor and I'm sure he did not resemble in the slightest what really happened, but then again what do I know?  NOT that great of a movie is what I know.",1150848000,2,1316,4.308943089430894
1541835,2,B00005JOIH,"MUNICH is an excellent film with the quality production value and performance of any other Spielberg film.

Yet, there is no excuse for the fact that Spielberg FICTIONALIZED a large portion of the film. Especially when the TRUE STORY is out there in so many other venues. Like the novels: Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team & Massacre in Munich: The Manhunt for the Killers Behind the 1972 Olympics Massacre.

In my opinion, there is no excuse for someone with such power, influence and experience in filmmaking like Spielberg has, to make a film that DISTORTS HISTORY, intent and emotion like MUNICH does. Those who don't have the gumption to look further into the issue will assume that the MOVIE is TRUTH. They will be misinformed.

The film IS EXCELLENT, as long as you look at it as FICTION.

The events are violent and unapologetic. The brutal nature of the events that unfolded are captured tremendously. Eric Bana's performance is OSCAR WORTHY. The story does get draggy at points, but the overall movie is a solid and worthy piece.

So, you come to the point where you have to decide STARS???  Do not be mistaken... this is a 4 or 5 star movie... but how many stars do you take away from a film and a Director that should have known better than to pass off FICTION as FACT. How incredibly ARROGANT and LAZY is it of Spielberg and UNIVERSAL to not have pursued more truth in their film. Included the REAL HITMEN's 2cents?

Or is it that UNIVERSAL and SPIELBERG were more concerned about getting across another hollywood skewed message to the current administration about revenge and war making things worse, that they weren't concerned about truth?

I THINK IT WAS THIS. With a little arrogance thrown in too. So... I give it a 2.",1150675200,9,1766,4.692556634304207

I believe this to be very close to the truth (there were a few differences from what I can remember about what I learnt of this topic in history).  Several teams were sent within Europe for revenge killings, but anyway ... Eric Bana was excellent in this.  His accent was down perfectly, and you could see he was a conflicted guy.  He was glad to get revenge, but yet he did things he thought were beyond him as a human being and he worried for his family.  The determination in his eyes was obvious but there was sadness too.  When he heard his baby on the phone for the first time and he broke down, that was heart-wrenching.

Overall, this is a fantastic movie that doesn't go into major depth about the actual Munich games themselves, but the aftermath of Israel making those responsable pay.

1541838,3,B00005JOIH,"I wanted very much to like this film.  As a rule, I'm a Spielberg fan and even though I feel he has slipped considerably from his 70's and 80's heyday, I still consider him a very talented individual and a genuine craftsman.  First and foremost, the title is misleading.  Though the killing of the Israeli athletes at the hands of Palestine terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympics is, indeed, the catalyst for everything that transpires in the film, it's not actually about that grim episode in modern history.  The movie is based on a book by George Jonas entitled ""Vengeance"" and that certainly would have been a far more descriptive if less marketable and powerful title.  The film is overlong and Eric Bana is dull as dishwater as Avner, the Mossad agent heading the Israeli counter-terrorist team in its retaliation efforts against the Palestine forces responsible for the massacre of the athletes.  The action sequences are very exciting and well done with the Spielberg's tension building trademark in full evidence, however, the rest of the film is scattered, the narrative a bit convoluted (especially the rapid fire sub-titles and I'm a fast reader) confusing and the constant change from location to location without any indication leaves the viewer to guess just where exactly they were.  Half of the time, I had to guess just where exactly they were:  Paris, NY, Beirut, Rome, Tel Aviv, etc?  I'm not here to engage in, debate over or doubt the veracity of that which is depicted in the film nor the morality tale that weaves through it; I'll leave that to the political analysts, historians, theologians and Jewish scholars.  My gripe deals exclusively with the artistic aspects of the film.  Is the film good?  It is.  Is it great?  Hardly and certainly not an Academy Award contender.  Also, can anyone explain to me why Spielberg chose to depict the epic final showdown between the terrorists and police at the airport in Munich as an image running through Avner's head as he mechanically and seemingly brutality has sex with his wife?  Shot mostly in slow-motion with an Arabic tinged, electronic score floating high above, it reeked of manipulative melodrama.  First and foremost, Avner was not there, so how could this brutal moment be running through his mind?  Incidentally, it's the second time that happens, the first being the initial massacre in the Olympic village. In the end, I just didn't give a darn about any of these people (save for the athletes) and that to me is the ultimate sign of films impact; it's ability to convey the plight, horror, joy, hope (or whatever other emotion) of its characters.  For all I cared, Avner and company could have retired to Boca and opened a video rental store or died martyrs for their cause.  Either way, it would have made no difference to me.  Don't get me wrong, I still think the film is worth watching because the good moments are, in fact, very good but just don't expect great cinema because regardless of the media and critics has lead you to believe, it's not.  As far as I'm concerned this film did not belong in the same exalted company as Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck and not even Crash, which is not as good as the other three, but works far better as an emotional experience than Munich ever does.  The Constant Gardener was a far superior film and should have taken Munich's place as a Best Picture nominee.",1150156800,6,3419,4.787052810902896
1541839,1,B00005JOIH,"Wow, after so much hype I was really looking forward to Munich. But Spielberg is at his worst here. For example, at the beginning, the Olympic hostage drama is played out but the viewer is given so little information that it's hard to put everything together.

I am very familiar with the historic events and I could place the scenes of the movie in perspective. But I watched it with some friends who had no prior knowledge and they were just left guessing at what actually happened. This is just horrible story-telling.

As the movie goes on, Spielberg tries to capture the European atmosphere while furterhing his plot, but it doesn't flow at all. One example are the numerous subtitles during dialogues. Some of them convey important ethical content, but to keep up with the pace of the scene, they are hard to read and disappear too fast - and I'm usually a speed-reader.

Another example is scene switching between international locations without much warning. One time you're sitting in a German beergarden, the next you're in a shop in Italy without much warning. I have been to most of those European countries and can tell them apart by sight, but it's way too confusing in the movie.

Whatever meaningful story Spielberg was trying to weave together it all breaks apart with his bad story-telling. It's a shame because Spielberg is capable of better , but this one isn't worth watching. Just read a book or surf the web and you'll learn more about the actual events than watching this movie.",1149984000,12,1502,4.743295019157088

1541841,5,B00005JOIH,"It's thought provoking, it's balanced and director Stephen Spielberg doesn't waste anytime getting to the heart of the issues or the action. Munich works on a number of levels as an audacious political statement, a tense thriller, and an inspiringly brutal look at two peoples forever caught up in a cycle of violence, constantly drowning in a sea of their own blood.

It's a bleak vision and Spielberg carries it off beautifully, providing us with a clipped and tight back-story, where the Palestinian terrorists invade the Olympic village in Munich, killing two members of the Israeli team and taking another nine as hostages.

The Israeli response is swift and fast with Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) authorizing a top-secret assassination campaign which will carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack. It is left to the hunky Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) to emotionally and strategically shoulder most of the burden.

The team is a seemingly innocuous and innocent mix. Daniel Craig's Steve is the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, often clashing with Ciaran Hinds' Carl, the cleanup man. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler).

As Avner cooks dinner, they all get to know one another, hashing out the fine details and the boarder implications for themselves and for the Jewish state. And so the methodological killing begins, yet as Munich progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas.

This is a world where the rule of the law is superfluous and where allegiances are none, the only constants are mistrust, paranoia, and the need to find more names, which inevitably comes at a price. No one is ever who they are, a drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB or the seductress at the hotel bar might be a hit woman.

Spielberg wisely avoids any soapbox speeches, but he does allow his characters to present both sides of the argument: At a safe house in Athens, Avner is confronted with a young Arab who tells him if the desperate need for a Palestinian homeland, a place they can call their own. And back in Israel, Avner's mother tells him that Israel is their land, finally they have a home and they will fight to keep it.

In Munich the themes are universal - the moral imperatives of violence, and in what circumstances can one justify such senseless murder. As Avner and his colleagues continue their operation, they become psychologically immune to it all. Yes - the operation may be successfully carried out, but how long will it be before righteous anger - the anger of the Israelis - can be continued before stumbling into bloody-mindedness? The irony is that in demonizing these Palestinian terrorists, they are themselves acquiring similar gruesome aspects.

It's all about the cycle of violence, a common problem that has plagued the Middle East for generations and will probably continue to do so. Munich deftly shows that everyone has their reasons for hating the other side - whether it is religious intolerance, or the fight over land rights - everyone ultimately thinks they're right, but such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people whatever side of the fence you are on.

""Munich"" is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only ""Munich"" is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of ""Munich"" are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.

What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.  This led to the Israeli government to have the Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- track down and kill every terrorist responsible for the killings. For this they hired one of Golda Meir's bodyguards, known as Avner (Eric Bana), put him in a special ops team, and gave them minimal information about these terrorists. Avner on his own is able to strike back at the ""supposed"" terrorists via the appearance of a shady Parisian named Louie (Mathieu Almaric), but as the assignments become more and more difficult, he wonders if it is all worth it, and once his own team gets decimated by counter-agents, he wonders if behind every terrorist there is a even more dangerous one just waiting in the wings with ways to get back at him and his family.

What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography - ""Munich"" is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is screenwriter Tony Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.  Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with ""Munich"", created perhaps the second truly adult movie of his career (the first being the incredible ""Schindler's List""). We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With this film, he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi. ""Munich"" is an intelligent and gripping thriller that was a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so.",1149638400,3,3936,5.301765650080257
1541903,2,B00005JOIH,"No need to summarize the movie...you know what happens.  So, with that said:

I understand what message was trying to be conveyed, but the film just lacked something.  Bland acting (other than Eric Bana), gratuitous nudity (girl in the bar - it's what happens to her afterwards), unnecessary scenes of violence (you don't need to show the athletes being riddled with bullets to know what happens to them), way too long.  This could have been another notch in Spielberg's belt of outstanding movies, but alas, it isn't.

I do however, commend him for taking on a difficult subject matter, and for that, I give the film two stars.

BTW, I lived in Munich during the '72 Olympics.  I was only 11, but the memory of what happened that summer had a lasting and profound effect on how I view the world, or more specifically, on how I view humanity.

1541905,2,B00005JOIH,"Most people over the age of 40 remember the terrible events surrounding the killing of the 1972 eleven-member Israeli Olympic team by a group of Palestinian extremists. Their abduction from Munich and ultimate death pulled a shroud over the games. Because of this horrific event, security at subsequent Olympic games has been ratcheted up significantly. But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding ""Thumbs Up"".

Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.

The acting is fairly blas&eacute; with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.

The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.)

I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history. But I felt the story lagged and was forced upon the viewer rather than coming across in a fluid manner.

Although I watched and enjoyed the Oscars this year, MUNICH stood out as the ""stinker"" in the Best Film category. I would've much preferred to see HUSTLE AND FLOW in the mix instead of this flick.",1149465600,5,2009,4.728571428571429

For everyone killed, two more were willing to step up to the plate. A great cast and movie.

As a thriller, ""Munich"" is efficient, absorbing, effective. As an ethical argument, it is haunting. It opens with a heart-stopping re-enactment of the kidnapping and deaths of Israeli atletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. While many will remember the feats of athletes such as Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut and U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz (Spitz, an American of Jewish faith, had already won his record 7 gold medals before this tragic event and was advised to leave Germany after being warned that he was an inviting target for further terrorism and agreed with West German officials), others will be painfully haunted by the memory of this horrific act just 6 days before the games were to finish (competition was suspended for 24 hours).

Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir states to her cabinet members ""Forget peace for now"". In her office it shows the formation of a secret Israeli revenge squad to kill those responsible. The film's most exciting moments are in the details of assassinations. Although the movie is just short of 3 hours (164 minutes), it will keep you riveted.

The same debate is going on right now in America. If it is true that civilizations must sometimes compromise their values, the questions remain: What is the cost, and what is the benefit? Spielberg clearly asks if Israel has risked more than it has gained. The movies questions are not only for Israel but for any nation that believes it must compromise its values to defend them. I'm sure this type of question will be debated for years/decades to come.

Munich follows how five men led by Eric Bana are put together to eliminate the Black September terrorists responsible for the massacre. The dialogue is good; the action is good when it's there; there is suspense and overall the movie is morbidly entertaining....Nothing like seeing terrorists get their just desserts.

But Steven Spielberg has gone a bit overboard with unnecessary detail creating wide gaps in the action that makes an epic out of a story that could easily have been told in a much shorter amount of time.

So if you've got almost 3 hours to kill, and you're looking for a realistic, detailed depiction of the events that occurred after the 1972 Munich massacre...this movie is a bullseye. If slow moving movies put you to sleep...nighty night.",1149120000,,984,4.776470588235294

If we are to believe in a global look then we must be wary of all hate and prejudice, whether in Africa or Eastern Europe, because this is the malignant plant that it breeds.

So these 11 runners and hurdlers and wrestlers come to Munich for the Olympiad in 1972, and are murdered. What to do?

Golda Meir didn't coin the phrase, but as contrasted with negotiation and talk, she enacts the (what is now) unconventional attitude of 'hunt them, find them, kill them'

And so a team led by Eric Bana begins just that, seeking the men responsible for the atrocity. The murderers were PLO, the infamous Black September group, and as history tells us eventually 9 of 11 were assassinated.

What Spielberg does is clearly avoided by revenge and retribution authors and directors from ""Shane"" onward. In those tales the hero is left lonely but victorious over evil. Here, we get to reflect upon the terrible toll of retribution.

To kill someone, even under the aegis of right, costs a lot. Just read the bio of Dick Winters in ""Beyond Band of Brothers"" to feel the palpable injury still shouldered by the remaining men of Easy Company, 60 years later.

This picture is brilliant. It may not be your cup of tea. But the amazing thing about it is how different people have different reactions. The very actions of Madame Meir may be an affront to you. But I submit that it is not a choice so much between killing and living. It becomes a choice between decision and indecision. She decides to act in a certain way. Avner (Bana) accepts the offer reluctantly, grows into it, finds himself double and triple teamed by it, and eventually suffers the consequences of his decisions.

Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Avner's team's handler, manipulative as management, seeing different goals, embracing different agendas. You have the feeling that for all of their cunning and intellect, the Israelis are as riddled with conflict between the government, the Mossad and purpose as we are in the United States. This is clearly a keeper and along with Ryan, Schindler, and BOB, Spielberg remains one of the top 3 or 4 directors in America unafraid of embracing the hot potato.

After navigating the catacombs of ethical issues, one of the film's characters utters ""there is no peace at the end of this."" True. Is it brilliant? I think so. You may not but you ought to see it. Larry Scantlebury. 5 stars.",1149033600,,2491,4.63265306122449
1541958,5,B00005JOIH,"(EDIT 3/3/15: In regards to the Blu Ray, you get the same extras as you did on the limited edition 2-disc DVD. The picture is literally perfect and the sound is incredible. As great as the film looks, the sound on this disc was dynamite and the real star of the show here. Surrounds are heavily used throughout the film and the low end frequency on certain scenes was off the charts. The scene where Avner is nearly killed by a larger than expected bomb felt like it was going to rupture my subwoofer. In short, if you already have the 2-Disc edition, the Blu Ray is a worthy upgrade and a worthy purchase if you don't already own the film.)

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not too crazy about the fact that they're charging what is basically a premium price for this two-disc set. I've seen other regularly priced discs with just as many extras, if not more, than this one has so you're probably asking yourself why am I recommending this?

The packaging for this disc is a very nice slipcase edition complete with a great 32 page photobook.

The 80 minutes or so of featurettes are very informative and cover a lot of what went into making the film, as well as details of the actual events of the '72 Olympics. Spielberg usually has a well put together set of featurettes for his films and this disc is no exception. Don't expect a director's commentary as Spielberg doesn't do them. He is gracious enough to provide an introduction to the film and does talk about it at length in the featurettes so, it's not like he pulls a Wachowski Brothers and absolutely refuses to say anything at all.

The disc looks and sounds great and though I would've loved a DTS track, the soundtrack is still thunderous in DD 5.1. In fact, this movie is mainly dialogue driven and is quite low key as a result but the explosions in this movie are downright huge.

As for the movie itself, I feel like it gets better every time I watch it.

1541959,5,B00005JOIH,"Director Steven Spielberg has brought to life the tragic events of September, 1972, when Palestinian terrorists abducted and eventually killed the members of the Israeli Olympic team who were competing at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany.

Infuriated by the murders and seeking revenge, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) approved the development of a special team of assassins who's job it would be to track down the Palestinians who were responsible for the killings and assassinate them. The team consisted of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler) and Carl (Ciaran Hinds).  These men were stripped of their identities, and, if caught, they were on their own.  Israel did not know them.  Their job was to track down the Palestinians throughout the world, excluding Arab countries, and eliminate them.

Working with a secret agency run by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and his father, the team is provided with pictures and the whereabouts of the Palestinians.  Soon, the group springs into action and the killings begin.  However, it does not come without cost to the Israelis.  Avner, who left his pregnant wife in Israel, is beginning to wonder about the true purpose of his mission, while the others, including Hans and Carl, meet their own demise.  In the end, Avner begins to suspect that Louis' agency may have been providing information on him and his group to the Palestinians, although this was never revealed to be true.  Avner's team succeeded in eliminated six of the eleven Palestinians, along with a female Dutch assassin who was suspected to be working with the Palestinians. Eventually, nine of the eleven Palestinians were elimated.  Two survived.

As for Avner, he and his family moved to Brooklyn, but he still had constant nightmares about his part in the assassinations.

This is a spectacular film.  The historical authenticity is perfect, and I especially thought the original ABC Sports broadcasts from the 1972 Olympics covering the kidnappings were one of the highlights of the movie.  Jack McKay and his co-anchors did a yeoman job of keeping the world informed about the crisis.  I can remember as a young child watching these events unfold on television, and I'm glad Steven Spielberg chose to incorporate them into the film.  The kidnapping scenes are especially shocking, while the scenes with Golda Meir and her advisors show her true resolve to avenge the athletes' deaths.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story of Avner's team is brought to life, and, although there were actually several Israeli teams looking for the Palestinians, the viewer gets a first-hand account of what it was like for these determined men to avenge their countrymen's deaths.  The acting is excellent, and, of course, the directing and production is top-notch.  Its easy to see why this movie was nominated for five Academy Awards.  Watch this masterpiece of a film and experience what it was like for those few tense days in September of 1972.",1148947200,,3045,5.109090909090909
1541960,4,B00005JOIH,"The best thing about Munich is that it is believeable.  Even knowing that it's based on a true story -- built from accounts, according to Spielberg, which could not be discredited -- I half-expected a James Bond over-the-top action/adventure.  I should have known that Spielberg would not stoop to cheap gimmicks and corny action cliches.

More than the action is the drama.  The characters have to confront the evil that was done in Munich in 1972.  The are forced to reflect on whether they're right in their response to that evil.  Without melodrama, Spielberg brings these issues to the surface, plays them out through credible interaction between the various characters.

The lone drawback of this movie is that it tends to drag at the end. It never gets boring, but it seems like some fat could possibly have been trimmed out somewhere.  This is a minor point as there's nothing in the movie that obviously does not fit.",1148860800,,926,4.8164556962025316
1541961,4,B00005JOIH,"When one considers the plight of Jews portrayed on film, nothing compares to Mr. Spielberg's ""Schindler's List."" And though this was a story that needed to be told, I can think of other Spielberg films that were somehow, more rewarding. ""Jaws"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" ""E.T."" ""The Color Purple"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and even ""Amistad.""

I can remember quite vividly, the tragic events that destroyed the whole meaning of World Unity, that were supposed to be the 1972 Olympic Games. I was 17, and trying to find meaning to life at the time. But rather than concentrating on the acts of revenge, I would rather have seen more character development, especially of the members of the Israeli Olympic team, and their life stories leading up to Munich. In some ways, I think the fascination with vengeance could be counterproductive to the future peace of Israel. Sad as that may sound. The impact and effect of viewing ""Munich"" still rates 4 stars though.",1148515200,2,964,4.878048780487805

There's action, there's strong plot, but there's also gut-wrenching slowness from time to time that allows room for reflection. It didn't even ""feel"" like a Hollywood movie, more like old European classic. I greatly appreciate Spielberg for being able to approach the heated Israeli vs Palestinians themes with such finesse.  The movie shows both the passionate attachment to the land of Israel (Avner, his mother, Golda Meir and others) and the heartbreaking struggle with the consequences of violence that goes around, around and around, destroying everything that's on its way (Avner at the end of the movie and lots of deaths on both sides). Movies or other popular media have the power to change or skew people's perception of history.

1541964,5,B00005JOIH,"This does not unfold like a Spielberg movie, as it at times is more artfully rendered and less sensational than most of his work.  Eric Bana is perfectly cast as a deep thinker in the shell of a hulk of sorts.  In the plot line, he is a secret service agent, and former Golda Meir bodyguard, assigned to kill those responsible for the deaths of Israili Olympic athletes.  Oddly similar to his casting as The Hulk, where he must also show both brains and brawn.

I won't go into the real events this is based on, as other review do so.  Instead I point out the movie has depth and subtlety.  In the final scenes Bana's character is in bed with his wife, and clearly traumatized.  He pictures the murder of the athletes which began the quest for revenge that took him from his family.  Does his wife know what images were running through his mind, how?  When the agent's superior refuses dinner with him, somehow this is a supreme dissavowal, but this is not stated.  Golda does not herself ever congratulate or even thank the agent.  Was this reprisal for certain of his actions?

Last, the legend of the Israeli secret service as an unstoppable agent of death, is questioned in the movie, but more so in real life.  Some of their targets appear unrelated to terrorism as the agent himself suspects, and at least one of the masterminds of the Olympic deaths, lives in the middle east still.",1148342400,2,1389,4.508
1541965,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielburgh's ""Munich"" is a fearless classic.  He takes the 1972 Olympic slayings of innocent Israeli athletes and recreates the ordeal in all its horrifying detail.  We get some of the footage from ABC's ""Wide World of Sports"" to create authenticity, but the reinactment has all the immediacy and horror of ""Schindler's List"" and more.  After the outrage, one of Golda Meier's trusted bodyguards (Eric Bana) is summoned to join a team of assassins meant to seek vengeance on the perpetrators.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on the complexity, the obsession, and the miscalculations that come from this type of counter-terrorism.  The missteps are harrowing.  The most touching scene is when they are set to bomb an assassin at his residence, but they immediately need to stop it when his adorable little daughter unexpectedly reappears.

There has been much commentary made about the agenda of this movie.  Despite any stance, Spielburgh has made a relevant movie, a true movie, at a crucial time.  The movie questions the premise of festering violence and its consequences.  It does so through the dialogue without preaching, but mainly through the action which is often horrifying and brimming with suspense.  There are two matching scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end, where the maverick protagonist has an intimate scene with his wife.  It doesn't really give away too much of the movie, but it frames the theme of the film.  He has become a hero to his people for requiting the crimes of the extremists, but it illustrates that he has done so at a high personal price.",1148256000,2,1601,4.92910447761194

1541967,4,B00005JOIH,"I think movies that delve into modern history to remind us what has happened and why events such as these shouldn't ever be lost to memory have to be my favorite. Munich is this type of film. Though named for the events that happened in 1972 Olympic Games, Munich follows not only what happened to the Israeli athletes but the reciprocation as well. Essentially, it turns into one man's story to fight for a country he believes in as a Jew and an Israeli, yet finds himself horrified by what he and his comrades have done and what they had done to them.

What hit me immediately about this film was the attempt Steven Spielberg made to try and keep his film culturally neutral. Though I think he failed, he did make an effort, which I have to appreciate as someone who has very little tolerance for racism. Movies such as this can create a stir, especially when they are as successful as Munich was, and creating a deeper sense of hatred between the two opposing cultures in this movie is something that definitely would have ruined the experience for me. So, though at times he slipped a little, Steven Spielberg did a great job at putting a human in all the roles, and not making monsters out of a culture we don't understand.

That leads me to the film itself, which was done to perfection. Steven Spielberg still is the greatest director out there, and shows that yet again with Munich. This is one tense film, starting early and only occasionally giving us breathers. Spielberg also did a lot to make the characters likable, despite the fact that they were political assassins. This movie plays out in stages, starting of course with the actual taking of the hostages in Munich, moving into the political battles of how best to get revenge for the massacre, and finally the undertaking of that revenge. The first two steps pass by rather quickly, and the action and suspense take over in the third step. Here is where the story of Avner begins to unfold, as he leads a group of five assassins--including Avner--who are charged by Golda Mier, the Israeli Prime Minister, to take out the eleven Palestinians who planned the Munich massacre. But as the group begins killing, and they become more and more accustomed to it, things begin to turn bad. Avner must find a way to deal with the hardships of being a family man and an assassin, while also keeping his team together.

Though I didn't give this a perfect rating, I still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Steven Spielberg takes his liberties, but all directors do in the end, and this movie never really attempts to be completely truthful. What it does attempt is a possible explanation of closely guarded historical events. And even if you aren't interested in learning, this is still a great action movie filled with lots of suspense.",1148169600,2,2802,4.656565656565657

The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me.  The point of the movie seems to be that revenge never really works and it only becomes dehumanizing to those who engage in it.

1542032,5,B00005JOIH,"Wow!  That's the easiest way to sum up ""Munich"", one of Steven Spielberg's darkest films.  ""Munich"", based on the book 'Vengeance' (which I admittedly have not read) depicts an Israeli revenge squad that targetted and assassinated Palestinian terrorists who allegedly planned the 1972 Black September killings.

The film begins with a terrifying recreation of the Olympic Games terrorism, and then intercuts those scenes with archival news footage to set up the exposition.  Being someone who didn't even know about the Munich killings, this was very informative for me.  We soon meet Avner (Eric Bana in a terrific performance), as he is briefed by Ephraim (the always colorful Geoffrey Rush) to lead a team of five to target and eliminate the responsible Palestinians.  The team is alone, will travel the entire world to find their targets, will do the job for as long as it takes, and are not to return until they are finished.

I believe there are two fundamental subjects to address here: the style of the film, and the controversey surrounding the film.

For those who don't know what kind of movie this is (as Spielberg is a very diverse filmmaker), this can best be summed up as a thriller that eventually becomes more of a dark character study.  The first act, so to speak, is very tense and suspenseful, as we watch Avner's team setup and kill their assignments.  Spielberg has an unrelenting style to these violent sequences.  In fact, ""Munich"" plays off as a good espionage flick at its best, but Spielberg is one step ahead of us.  The first few assassinations are exciting and involving, because Avner's team is feeling their first adrenaline rush and possibly enjoying the thrill of the kill.  But as the mission goes one for months, things become more terrifying and dangerous.  The hunters become the hunted, allies become enemies, and beliefs becomes delusions...which brings me to the controversy.

In short, the movie allows both Israelis and Palestinians to argue both sides of the coin.  The topic is, of course, who deserves to live in Jerusalem.  ""Munich"" treats this as most great movies do: Nobody is 100% right, and nobody is 100% wrong.  I believe the scene that angers most critics is the one where Avner and another mercenary talk in the middle of the night, and basically agree that maybe conflict between the two factions is better than peace.  Is it because peace is unattainable?  Or is it because neither side would know what to do with absolute victory?  Questions like these, especially regarding a heated subject, get people's blood boiling.  But again, Spielberg and the writers are one step ahead of us.  This subject is supposed to get a reaction out of you.  This isn't an intellectual seminar; ""Munich"" is a disturbing film that doesn't play it safe.  Spielberg does not bring any sentimalism or sweetness to this movie at all.  We as viewers become more involved and allow Spielberg to command our complete attention.

The point isn't ""Who's right?"" - the point, according to the movie, is that both sides' followers have desensitized and corrupted their souls by allowing ideals and beliefs become extremist violence.  As ""Munich"" progresses, Avner's team begins to forget their Israeli beliefs, not to mention their sanity.  Their mission, which is supposed to be done out of loyalty and faith, becomes militaristic and, even worse, habitual.  My last note to political critics: If you strongly believe your point of view, then watching this movie isn't going to change your mind.  Movies like this either make you question your beliefs, or do nothing but strengthen what you already know.  What have you got to lose?  Plus, ""Munich"" is mostly a thriller anyway.  Just as ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a love story and not gay-activist propaganda, ""Munich"" is a character study and not a political ploy.

""Munich"" is a masterpiece in every way.  The cast is fantastic, particularly Bana and Rush, and Michael Lonsdale as a French informant who has a cold yet fatherly relationship with Avner.  John Williams composes one of his more subtle musical scores, and wisely doesn't let the music undermine the action.  But this is Steven Spielberg's acheivement.

Spielberg also asks The question: are the killings only to replace the terrorist leadership with more effective and ruthless men?

1542036,5,B00005JOIH,"Since my typical approach is to talk about some cheap little movie that no one takes seriously and discuss it at length I believe here I shall discuss a well-known, controversial film and consider it in a very shallow, brief manner.  So here I go:  'Munich' is an extremely sharp, well-done thriller.  So many people are solely interested in considering this film from a political standpoint, I can't help but point out that this is still a movie, a frequently exciting and tense movie at that.  Though I've always  assumed that such covert operations exist even in so-called 'civilized' nations, notions of government funded assassinations and the like have never really seemed real to me, which makes this movie all the more fascinating, turning it into a glimpse into a hidden, but apparently real world. (And it goes beyond this, giving us glimpses of amoral, anti-government, mafia-esque groups in europe and lone seductress-assassins, the latter of which I hadn't assumed actually existed in reality, but perhaps they do...)  Of course, I have no way of knowing how closely the team here resembles the real squads sent out to off Black September, but I've somewhat arbitrarily determined that this is probably pretty close to the truth.  More to the point, film itself makes it very easy to do this, as it simply feels utterly real.  Or, I should say, utterly real at least in terms of how the characters act and their general motivations and whatnot-- The film itself is very stylishly, often expressionistically made, not generally gritty or documentary like or whatever.  It stradles the line, managing to be cinematic but not over the top or anything like that.  Performances are all top-notch, with particular note going to Eric Bana as Avner, leader of the team.  He is the most, well, normal guy in the team, so naturally he is the one who gradually becomes the most affected by their operations.

Still, I can't help but discuss the political aspects of the movie to some degree.  Suffice to say, I think it's best to take this film most purely at face value, as an exploration of how violence is bound to effect those who inflict it on others, even if the violence is just and the target deserving.  Killing is neither simple nor pleasant, and gunning people down unarmed men in hallways and bombing others is likely going to have a pretty adverse affect on you regardless of any other details.  This is, perhaps, a fairly obvious point, but like all films that actually work on a thematic level, 'Munich' makes you actually *believe* it with your gut rather than just be consciously aware of the concept in an abstract way.

The film isn't w/o a few problems.  Firstly, it takes a bit too long to wind down after the operations are over.  Some of this is necessary, yes, but not all of it.  We're made plenty aware of Avner's deteriorating mental state during the later portions of the operation, we don't need to have it pointed out to us so much after the fact.  Also, the juxtaposition of Avner and his wife having sex and the bloodbath on the runway is pretty damn heavy handed and over the top.  The slow-motion shots of Avner, umm, thrusting with droplets of sweat spraying everywhere as he screams and screams are just a bit much for my taste, thank you.  But that's about it as far as problems are concerned.  This is simply a very good, very believable and intense thriller.  Check it out.

Lastly, I've only got the single disc DVD.  It looks very nice, though the artwork itself does make me laugh.  Makes it look like it's a video game.

1542037,3,B00005JOIH,"SPIELBERG WANTED FOR PLAGERISM -

READ THE FOLLOWING AND DECIDE WHICH MOVIE IS DIFFERENT

All I can say is ""Munich"" was well done as all of Spielberg's movies are.

Spielberg shamelessly ripped off a movie from the 80's called ""Sword Of Gideon"" He even copied scenes shot for shot. He also gave no credit to the ""Sword Of Gideon"" Filmakers  ""Sword of Gideon,"" is now available on DVD premiered on HBO in 1986. Like Steven Spielberg's film ""Munich"" about Israel's response to the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympic Games.

Not as bloody as ""Munich"" but not as slow.

Close to three hours long and nearly 20 years old, this TV movie from HBO fares decently for what it was and is-a look at Israel's legendary counter-terrorist initiative following an attack on its Olympic athletes in Munich.

Based on George Jonas' book Vengeance, ""Sword of Gideon"" spends most of its time portraying how Israeli agents crossed the globe killing Arab extremists-including members of the ""Black September"" organization that masterminded the ""Munich Massacre"" killing 11 Israelis in September 1972.

The movie stars Steven Bauer(Scareface) as Avner, a commander in the Israeli army who is recruited by the Mossad (Israel's intelligence agency) to lead the team of spies that will exact revenge for Jewish deaths.

The first couple of minutes show a re-creation of the attack in Munich; the rest concentrates on Avner's recruitment, training and executing of mission ... and men. One of the movie's most significant features is the way it depicts Avner and company killing their targets in cold blood.

""Gideon"" also shows how Avner's work affects his personal life, especially his relationships with his wife (Leslie Hope) and father (John Hirsch).

Colleen Dewhurst makes a cameo as Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. She personally appeals to Avner to take the assignment, telling him that ""the guilty must not go unpunished.""

 Israel, she says, ""exists to protect us from our enemies and to provide us with a haven in this world where we can live in peace. But they will not let us live in peace."" They are killing Jews everywhere, she says-even in Munich.

SOUND FAMILIAR KEEP READING...

""Meanwhile the rest of the world is playing volleyball and winning medals,"" she continues, referring to the fact that when the terrorists seized the athletes in Munich, the Olympic Committee initially decided to carry on with the games.

 Avner says he needs to think about the offer, but it doesn't take him long to accept. He is guided by a top-level official named Samuels, played convincingly by Rod Steiger, who introduces him to the other team members.

There's Hans (Robert Joy), who specializes in documents; Robert (Michael York), the explosives expert; Jean (Laurent Malet), who's in charge of transportation; and Karl (Peter Dvorsky), whom they call the ""sweeper"" because he makes sure they leave no traces.

Then it begins: hit after hit after hit, with a fair amount of attention to the conflicting feelings of Avner's team. For example, as they prepare to whack one of the terrorists in France, they are concerned about the man's young daughter and the effect his killing will have on her.

 Along the way, Avner and his men become targets themselves as word of their executions spreads among their enemies. The last hour of the movie gets a bit weighted down as each planned killing becomes less interesting than the one before.

 IT's THE SAME MOVIE. SPIELBERG DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT. AS A JEW I SEE HIM AS BEING GUILT RIDDEN. HE OPENS THE DVD BY BASICALLY DEFENDING HIMSELF AND THE MOVIE (WHICH HE STOLE)",1147564800,5,3615,4.948675496688741
1542110,4,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" manages the difficult feat of presenting Steven Spielberg at his best, and at his worst, demonstrating his considerable gifts in the way of pacing, creating suspense, and generating a response from his audience while at the same time greatly underestimating the intelligence of his audience. For every moment that inspires awe, there is another that inspires a collective cringe, as the audience realizes it is being trusted with nothing, and has been lead around by its nose by a director that is so determined to make sure we get his message that he is willing to abandon all subtlety in order to do so.

Consider: The central character in Spielberg's ""Munich"" is an Israeli wet-work specialist named Avner. Avner is hired, along with several other men, to enact bloody retribution against those responsible for plotting the execution of Israeli athletes at the Olympics in the early seventies. His wife is expecting a child. In one scene, we see him coordinating the murder of a Palestinian sympathizer who has a young daughter. We know he has a young daughter because she is paraded around for several minutes, exchanges significant looks with the Israeli assassins, acts cute as a button, and is serenaded by vibrant, melodramatic music. This would be bad enough in itself-- surely, the Palestinian who is to be assassinated, an articulate, even-tempered man who seems as far from a terrorist as can possibly be imagined, is sympathetic enough on his own. But no. Spielberg not only drags in the child, and uses her as a device to create suspense when it seems like she might be in the line of fire. Not only do we get a scene where Avner is waiting in the hospital for his wife to deliver her baby, as a counterpoint to the violence he has just perpetrated.

No, Spielberg is still not convinced that we get it. So, we get a scene in which the most reluctant member of the assassination squad (a man whom the Mossad, an organization that relies on men whom it knows to be dedicated to the preservation of Israel, never would have hired for the work in question to begin with) congratulates Avner on the birth of his child. This is followed by a close up of Avner's ashen face. Avner turns to walk out the door... and is stopped by his interrogator, who congratules Avner again-- for the successful assassination of the Palestinian man with the child, who, it seems, has officially died of his wounds. Another shot of Avner's conflicted visage. End of scene.

It's a testament to Spielberg's considerable talent that his film is able to survive such embarassing lapses in judgment, which occur often, but are counterbalanced by the sheer momentum of the film he has created. For the most part, ""Munich"" is a lean, brutal, fast-paced work of art. The film is impeccably organized and structured. We begin with a galvanizing recreation of the Palestinian attack on the Munich games. Then, we are briefly introduced to Avner, and his wife. Then, Avner is given his mission, and the rest of the film, more or less, follows a rigid structure that would become repetitive, were it not so well-handled by Spielberg.

That pattern is as follows: First, we are introduced to Avner's contact, the man who finds the targets for the Israeli assassins. Then, we are introduced to the targets, in brief vignettes that create sympathy for them. Then, we see the Israelis at work, plotting the assassination. Then, the assassination commences, briefly and brutally. Then, the team members face the aftermath of what they have done, debate the merit of what they have achieved, wonder about whether they can trust their contacts, and view news reports about the reprisals their own mission has spurred. Intercut throughout are flashbacks of the events at Munich, as more and more of the actual violence is revealed to us.

This happens over and over again. Did I believe what I saw? Was I convinced that it happened this way? Not really. As I mentioned earlier, Mossad, the Israeli spy network, has always been an organization that takes the loyalty of its members very, very seriously. It surely would never have hired men like Karl, the reluctant, very liberal member of the team, who incessantly questions whether it is RIGHT to kill any man at all (remember, this is supposed to be an assassin!) for such a mission. Similarly, Avner, the protagonist of the film, the leader of the Israeli team, is seen to undergo a crisis of conscience as a result of his labors. I was unsurprised to learn that the real Avner has never expressed such doubts-- the book on which ""Munich"" is based, and Avner's own comments (he's still alive) bear this out.

Further, Spielberg is so determined not to offend any Palestinian sympathizers that we never encounter any radical Islamists-- you know, the kind that blow up buses in Jerusalem, not because they wish to liberate Palestine, but because they believe that Jews are infidels who pray to the wrong god-- indeed, we never encounter any Palestinians at all who seem more extreme than, say, Mahmoud Abbas. Avner has an extended political debate with a young Palestinian who sounds like an International Relations major from Cal-Berkeley.

But I digress. The ideas behind the film take a backseat, for the most part, to the dynamic action on the screen at almost all times. Rarely has film violence been wielded so effectively. There is blood and gore, but it is brief and far from exploitive. The aftermath of a surprisingly large explosion, which leaves a body hanging from a ceiling lamp, and a confused young couple wandering around, naked, bleeding from their eyes, and seemingly waiting to be told what to do next, is incredibly well staged. But the film's best set piece is a massive Israeli operation in Beirut, in which something like eighty Palestinians are killed by machine gun fire, doors are kicked down, and it seems like forty people are on screen at any given time-- but we never once lose track of what's going on. Lest we forget, Spielberg reminds us that he knows how to direct action masterfully.

The spiraling sense of doom that accompanies the latter half of the film, in which it becomes evident that no one can be trusted, the team starts to fall apart, and the effectiveness of the mission becomes increasingly called into question, is something to be experienced as well. There is a subplot that is jump started by Avner's encounter with a lonely woman at a bar that has the logic of a nightmare-- not the ""War of the Worlds"" kind, but the kind Scorcese created in ""After Hours."" Spielberg has never strayed this far from the mainstream, and it's something to witness.

In the end, I believe ""Munich"" is worth seeing. It's not the message movie that many have made it into. It's a gripping work that exploits all of the resources of the cinema-- sometimes to its detriment, where emotional manipulation is concerned-- and even the more conservative members of the audience should appreciate it without feeling like Spielberg is spoon-feeding them liberal propoganda. I don't see ""Munich"" as a pro-Palestinian polemic-- I see it as an suspense film that wants to enthrall its audience above all things but doesn't want to be accused of neglecting political correctness. Accordingly, it makes concessions, to Palestinians, to the liberal supporter of their cause, and, yes, to the audience's intelligence.

There is much to admire here, but I can't help but wonder what might have been, if Spielberg let the Mossad be as uncomprising and rigid as they have proved themselves, over the years, to be, and done the same with a number of the Palestinians. The reason that peace between Israel and Palestine has proved untenable is because neither side has proven willing to compromise. On the basis of Munich, you'd draw the conclusion that a long-winded discussion would settle everything, as all parties seem mutually conflicted. History has proven that this is simply not the case.

Rated R: Though there is some sexuality and language, the film's violence is what stands out above all else. ""Munich"" contains a great deal of violence and an extraordinarily high body count, but Spielberg deserves a medal for the taste in which he handles it. It's gruesome and messy without drawing attention to itself, as I felt ""Saving Private Ryan"" did, and is thus more palatable than, say, the violence in ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Casino."" I don't think the average audience member will have a problem with what they see.",1147564800,3,8467,4.860706860706861
1542111,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" certainly polarized filmgoers; many found Spielberg's film to be anti-Israeli and many others felt it was anti-Arabic. In truth Spielberg didn't take sides and neither did writers Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") and Eric Roth; Spielberg's film is a complex look at the cost of violence and murder. Avener (Eric Bana)and his team of former Mosad members (Daniel Craig the new James Bond, Hans Zischler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheu Kassovitz)discover that the cost of violence is the loss of your soul as they try and track down members of the terrorist group Black September that planned the kidnapping and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Over the course of a year Avner and his men hunt down these men while becoming the hunted as well. It's a riveting thriller with strong performances from the entire cast. Brilliantly directed by Spielberg ""Munich"" may run about 15 minutes too long but this powerful suspense film never wavers or loses its momentum as it thunders towards its conclusion. For those who claim that ""Munich"" ripped off its plot from the TV movie ""Sword of Gideon"" it should be noted that both are based on the same book and the scenes that have the most similarity are those that are drawn from the book.

The transfer looks terrific with the subdued colors and fine detail captured in perfectly on disc. While occasional digital flaws come up (such as edge enhancement) they are minor and only crop up on occasion. I'm at a loss as to why Universal and Dreamworks have elected to release this in the same configuration as the ""War of the Worlds"" DVD late last year. More than likely it's due to reduce the cost of the discs since many retailers offer these big blockbusters as loss leaders to get people into stores and this would allow the studio to create economical versions that won't eat into their profit margins too much.

The single disc edition has only a introduction by Steven Spielberg and some trailers as the only extras. The two disc edition although it lacks a commentary track from Spielberg (to date he hasn't done any)does feature a number of interesting featurettes. They don't make up for the lack of a comprehensive documentary on the real event (the best documentary on the Munich assassinations is ""One Day in September"")or a commentary track by Spielberg and/or the writers who worked on the film but are pretty good overall.

""Memories of an Event"" presents Spielberg and Kushner recalling their reactions when they heard about what occurred. ""Portrait of an Era"" provides insight and information about recreating the early 70's for the film. ""The On-Set Experience"" gives us onset footage of the shooting of the film. ""The International Cast"", ""Editing, Sound and Music"" gives us insight into both the casting for the film and why Spielberg went with the choices he did (for example Spielberg had been thinking about Bana after seeing ""Hulk"") and ""Editing, Sound and Music"" takes us into the post-production of the film. It was done on an extremely tight schedule because of the predetermined release date and post-production of ""War of the Worlds"". ""The Mission, The Team"" focuses on the genesis of the script, Spielberg's interest through production. We also get a collectable booklet with photos and rave review quotes from critics.

While the 2 disc edition isn't essential it will be a nice catch for fans of the film and those into the film process. The single disc edition should be fine for most folks. ""Munich"" isn't an easy film to watch nor does it take political sides. Spielberg recognizes that the killing for any political reason has its consequences and tolls on the human soul.",1147478400,,3699,4.904153354632588
1542112,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich was by far the best film of 2005 and should have won best picture at the Oscars. Munich is about how terrorism effects society and the lengths a nation will go to protect its citizens and destroy the terrorists. Yet, the terrorists are not made to seem ""evil."" The terrosrists are viewed as heroes in their homelands and the director takes the effort to depict both sides of the conflict. The themes are dark, the violence is beyond graphic, and there are no happy endings. I must say that Munich was a hard film to watch but living in a post 9/11/01 era, it is an important film to watch.",1147478400,,596,4.378378378378378
1542113,4,B00005JOIH,"The central issue of this film is whether or not the ""eye for an eye"" approach to terrorism simply adds fuel to the fire, which, when you think about it, this theology of retribution is what has poisoned the world since Cain whacked Abel. With the clarity of hindsight, Spielberg's nerve-wracking account of the revenge visited upon the Arab murderers of Munich makes the case quite boldly that, as Eric Bana's character points out, when you kill off these villains, more and worse replace them. It's a bit like cancer, isn't it? You think you have it irradicated, then a relapse, only it's worse. Perhaps this was the defining flash point, in much the same way that Derry & Bloody Sunday ignited the Northern Ireland bloodbath. If so, certainly the world was never the same after Munich.

The world's never the same after any human tragedy of such unrelenting violence, be it Bosnia, WW2, Viet Nam, 9-11. There's no shortage of trigger points that would seem to argue for us to consider another way of dealing with such deep and festering ills, but don't. Well, all but for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which it mat come to before the Middle East becomes enlightened, as it were.

As for the film, it's a very gripping and powerful story. The actors are remarkable in their roles - from Eric Bana, to the little girl who plays the daughter of one of the Muslim lynchpins of Munich, each and every character is spot on. Bana delivers a soulful portrayal of a man who arrives at a moral crossroads, or perhaps, more accurately, realizes he has crossed an immoral threshold, especially when one of his colleagues, the bombmaker, pleads for justice as an obligation that must be revered and honoured. There are many disturbing moments throughout the film, and the toll they take on Bana become so heavy you'll find yourself not bearing up very well under their weight. For me, it was the murder of the Dutch spy on her boat. The obscenity of the revenge will knock the wind out of you. I'm still quite upset by it.

Daniel Craig is frighteningly menacing as a Jewish assasin who has no moral qualms about the job he must do. He is, in many ways, the ideological antipode to Bana: one becomes less convinced and one becomes more convinced of the ethics of their assignment as the killings go on and the counterattack from the Muslims seeks to trump them. Duplicity abounds among the hidden players, most notably the Americans. At some point, even though this is just a movie, you wonder when the US citizenry will wake up to the way their governments repeatedly play both sides of the street. Give the Israeilis their due: they mean what they say. For the matter, so do the Muslim extremists, but Bush will figure that out when Iran strikes back. Back here in the early 70's, when terrorism honestly shocked you as abhorrent, the opportunity to consider how to redress the roots of this issue pass. Bana and an Arab extremist share a safe-house in one of the most ironic sequences of the story. The Arab resolve to never give in resonates with Bana's character. For Craig's character, that is simply a call to go to the mattresses and deliver the final blow, for Bana, it underscores the vicious circle they have all played themselves into.

Craig is superb. This bodes well for the next James Bond film, if the franchise owners can manage to hire a writer who can deliver a story instead of an infomercial. He went from this film to LAYER CAKE, one of the best Britfilms ever. Hopefully, he will insist on the edgy danger he seems to generate.

I did not get the edition with all the special stuff on it, but I'm told it's as well. The special edition apparently tends to cheapen the experience of the ethical questions this film raises. Better it should be so hard to find.

In the end, I can't help but hear ""Blood On The Rooftops,"" the Steve Hackett song from Genesis' WIND AND WUTHERING CD of the mid-70's:

Inspired in part by true events that occurred after the tragic terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich olympics, the movie offers the difficult question of just when does revenge become simply murder?  As in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg has some deeply disturbing and realistic scenes that are uncomfortable to watch in the sanctity of your home.  But the film is powerful indeed.  Eric Bana is marvelous in the role of Avner, giving us an honest portrait of a man who questions his ethics; Geoffrey Rush is great as his deceptive boss; and the underappreciated Ciaran Hinds glows in his role as the team's ""worrier.""  Surprisingly, future James Bond Daniel Craig's role is the least developed, but he does an okay job.

1542115,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich asks many questions about the difference between right and wrong.  It asks the veiwer to decide whats so different between what happened at the 1972 Israli Olympics and what the Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team did in responce.  In 1972 Palestinian terrorists held Israli athletes hostage, eleven of them, and then murdered them all.  This group of terrorists went by the name of Black September.  After the aftermath a group of Jewish nobodies was formed for the soul purpose of killing the men resposible for planning the murders.  This movie follows their story.  The team leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a married man expecting child and within moments his life is put on hold and put in danger.  As the movie progresses you can see that Avner battles moral issues, trying to decide whether what he's doing is worth all that he could be giving up.  There's a scene where he's talking to his child on the phone and he breaks down because he's missing so much, and for all he knows he could miss everything.  As we learn more about the conflict between these two people, the Jewish and Arab people, we begin to see there may not me much difference between them at all.  Is their revenge that much different then their reason for such?  ""Thousands of years of hatred doesn't make you decent.""  Besides asking such moral questions, that aside, this film offers a thrilling story, a thrilling, fast past and engaging film that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Through flashbacks we see what exactly happened on that fateful day at the Olympics.  The morality really plays key here as each and every man on the mission battles feelings of guilt and a lack of morality as they carry out this mission for their country, for their people.  It's a story for all to see, about revenge and the act of and how it affects us as a people but also as individuals.  Acting on all fronts is brilliant, Bana especially.  Spielberg is genius.

1542117,5,B00005JOIH,Speilberg surprised me with this.  It is a truly open-minded story based on the aftermath of the Munich Olympic massacre in 1972.  It would have been easy to villainize the Palestinians for this act.  And they certainly would have earned it for what they did.  But Speilberg uses the atrocity to illustrate that there are in fact legitimate and understandable issues on both sides.  And only when we really look at that can we move toward peace. Politics aside though is it a great film on it's own?  Yes!  Especially if you like femme fatales- that Dutch assasin- wow!  I would have said f-it and let her bribe me into not killing her.  This is a great action-adventure/drama with some great comedic bits thrown in as well.  I am not going to spoil it by recapping the storyline.  Just see it.,1147305600,,794,4.560283687943262
1542118,5,B00005JOIH,"Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma.  Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing.  MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us.  And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.

The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer.  From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end.  This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.

The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission.  They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale).  Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers.  In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.

The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs.  It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it.  Highly Recommended.

1542197,5,B00005JOIH,"I have always been a Steven Spielberg fan, and have enjoyed all his movies with the single exception of Saving Private Ryan (yes, I might be the only person in the world who did not like that movie - I felt it was too gruesome, and I hated the shakey camera filming) so I might be somewhat biased when it comes to him.  Yet this film, which portrays both the internal and external political struggles of terrorism, and the personal impact for one man and his family of being an active participant in retaliation (more terrorism), was a moving film.

  Of greatest personal signifigance was a scene where the team from Israel was rented a safehouse that had also been rented by members of the PLO for the same time frame.  This scene developed the argument between Palestine and Israel in a way that I believe most people, like me, who are not Arabic, or Jewish, can understand.  This is so important for people, ESPECIALLY Americans, to comprehend.  Yet for some reason, many Americans just don't get it.

  What has happened historically in this region, and within the last 75 years, is that the Allies (from WWII) displaced the Palestian People, removed them from the homes they felt they owned, they had mortgages on, they had decorated, they had raised thier children in... just like the homes we live in in the USA, in order to restore Israel's people to their beloved holy land, from biblical times.  This would be the equavelent of moving all the people from Rhode Island into say, Central Florida.  Taking all the current residents of Central Florida forcibly out of their homes, and moving them to they Keys. There is no way that doing this would be without major problems. As American's we would not allow this to happen, so why is the world so suprised that Palestine is angry?

  This movie touches upon the feelings of a Palestinan in one scene, and in the next, that same Palestianian is gunned down. It also depicts the Jewish reaction to Palestine, on two levels; the political and the righteous. This sceries of two scenes is so telling of the reality of this situation.  I felt that this alone worth the money for this DVD.

  Of course there is much more to this movie!

  When a Jewish man says to another Jewish man, ""come, break bread with me"", and the other man turns away, it forces you to look at the personal issues faced by each member of any terrorist team.  Who does an assassin break bread with?

  Is there any sense at all to the impact of terrorism?  No!  Not for the terrorist (if they have a heart), and not for the people he fights for.

1542200,5,B00005JOIH,"One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel. This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe. But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing ""struggle"" for ""order."" Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time. This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of ""liberty"" and ""property,"" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well. In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.

The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the core of Steven Spielberg's ""Munich."" The massacre of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing. Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded. There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village. Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that ""they're all gone"" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing. But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he has to do and later for what he has done.

Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich. Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them. His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done. Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.

We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed. But the first has translated ""The Arabian Nights"" into Italian. The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich. They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics. But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist? Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.

""Munich"" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.

I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel ""Munich"" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.",1147219200,10,6060,4.670411985018727

1542202,4,B00005JOIH,"When I heard that a director of the caliber of Steven Speilberg was making a movie based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, I was very excited. I remember the events as they happened and I have read of the revenge operation that followed. When I saw the movie ""Munich"" however, I was a bit disappointed. For all of the hype surrounding the movie I was geared up for one of Speilberg's best. But I think it fell short. First of all, as the release date for the movie approached, I read several news items stating that he was  rushing to complete it. The rush to have it ready for Oscar consideration showed.  Secondly, I have always read that the Mossad was a very elite organization, known for it's effective and efficient ruthlessness. They were considered the best of the best when it comes to covert operations. This movie showed the ""hit team"" as being a collection of incompetent ""wannabes"".  Thirdly, with all of the sources now available for this subject, I am troubled that Speilberg relied on one book (""Vengeance"" by George Jonas). In fact, I have read that former Mossad agents have roundly blasted the Jonas book as ""inaccurate"". These are just a few of my gripes. On the bright side, I thought that Eric Bana turned in a wonderful performance.  I liked the movie just as an action movie as long as I didn't think about it being ""based on real events"". All things considered, I give it 4 stars, mainly because Bana's acting kept it from being a 3.  I also read where the widows of some of the murdered athletes saw the movie and approved of it. If they approve of it, it can't be all bad. It's a decent movie that is worth a look. But I agree with one of the other reviewers who says that if you want a truly complete and ""balanced"" look at the Munich massacre, you are much better served by checking out the documentary ""One Day in September"".  Also, the History Channel has an excellent documentary on the Mossad and the Munich revenge operation.",1147046400,2,1963,4.5
1542203,4,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"", written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the novel by George Jonas; directed by Steven Spielberg.

It's winter, and that means Oscar season, and that means Serious Films. The studios trot out their takes on weighty, uncommercial subject matter in search of Best Picture gold. Many Oscar-bound films tend to stiffen and dehydrate under the strain between their sombre content and accommodating their audience. ""Munich"" is not one of them.

On the surface, Spielberg has made an extremely accomplished and emotional thriller, but beneath its gleaming exterior is something more. ""Munich"" is not about supporting political actions or taking sides. It's about the motives and justifications that lead one down a path of vengeance - a path that ultimately has no end, along the way destroying many of the goals and values meant to be preserved.

It's the story of Avner, son of a military hero (and new father himself) who is offered the job of leading a covert team to assassinate the leaders of Black September. This group was behind the 1972 massacre of eleven Israeli atheletes during the Munich Olympics. Initially Avner rejects the offer, but reconsiders to get his family off to a better financial start.

The body of the film, then, involves Avner and his four-man team zeroing in on eleven targets within or involved with Black September. The missions begin simply - a man is shot dead in his apartment house lobby - but become increasingly messy and complicated as the story progresses. More and more people are killed with less and less connection to the team's purpose, and Avner himself becomes increasingly desensitized and haunted by his tasks. It also becomes clear that there is a network of political groups, all with conflicting goals of their own, each being motivated to ever-escalating violence as their paths collide. Naturally, it becomes increasingly difficult to know who to trust, or to justify what trust may exist.

In the end, Avner's trust disappears. His dreams of home and family are forever changed - he lives as a New York exile, brewing in constant fear of retribution by the groups he's attacked. His horrors of the original massacre continue undiminished, and the men he trusted are either dead or have withdrawn back into the shadows. The political targets that he eliminated have been replaced by ones all the more resolved by his violence. Little has changed. It's one of the best endings to a Spielberg film in recent memory. It's easily his best film since ""Schindler's List"".

The performances are strong across the board, particularly Bana and Geoffrey Rush as his superior, Ephraim. The storytelling (with Janusz Kaminski's cinematography leading the way) is extremely visual, quite an accomplishment considering the amount of exposition needed for this type of picture. John William's score is restrained and sensitively used, helping to support the emotional currents of the film. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's screenplay is even-handed, eloquent, and even humorous at times. There are parallels (handled well) that can be made to our current situation - our post 9/11 actions are echoed within this story as a larger history, one with a troubling legacy.",1147046400,,3214,5.089184060721062
1542204,1,B00005JOIH,"Eric Bana turns in a fair performance as Avner. Bana is not known for his blockbuster roles.

The story is absurd. The movie is based on true events, but when the cut and pasted pieces of the actual events of September, 1972 end, complete fantasy ensues. The movie shows a handful of relatively incompetent ""regular"" guys plotting assassinations to avenge the Black September attacks on the Israeli athletes. They are so darn regular you just want to get up from your chair and go watch a football game rather than sit through any more of this long, dragging snooze of an action movie.

The movie, worse still, smells of political righteousness and how humanely these people were assassinated. One scene shows one of the conspirators running desperately to stop his associates from activating a telephone bomb when the target's little girl answers the phone. The scene left the sense that there was some political message that the scene and the movie reek of for 2 hours and 45 minutes. That message is the same tired saw...love Jews, love Israel, oppose Israel and you are an anti-Semite. Its not as simple a conflict as that in reality.

There is nothing memorable about the movie, the score, the cinematography, the script and the acting are all subpar at best. It leaves you wanting to watch a good movie. How this piece of drivel could garner even one academy award nomination is obvious. Steven Spelberg. Mr. Spelberg I celebrate your accomplishments, Jaws, Poltergeist, Schindler's List and Jurassic Park to name a few. Please don't inflict any more movies like this on us anymore.

After Munich, we watched ""One Day in September""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Day-in-September/dp/B000BNXD6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Day in September</a>&nbsp;which is a documentary about the same 1972 attacks. We decided that, for the time involved, we would have rather watched One Day in September twice rather than Munich once and we still would have had a few minutes to spare. If you want to watch something that fairly treats both sides and is extremely entertaining, walk by Munich and pick up One Day in September.

After this review I watched the made-for-TV original fictional account of the horrific Munich Games attacks ""21 Hours in Munich""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21-Hours-at-Munich/dp/B000BNXD5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21 Hours at Munich</a>. Its much better than ""Munich"" and escapes too much one-sided political preaching. It doesn't pretend to be ponderous, its a 70s ""Cowboys and Indians"" type movie.

1542205,4,B00005JOIH,"This was by far one of the best films of 2005 and ranks right up there with Spielberg's Private Ryan and Schindler's List. However, I beleive that Speilberg spoiled the film by choosing the World Trade Center as the background of the final scene. What was the message of that shot supposed to be? Since America did not do enough to stop terrorism that we ended up paying an enormous price for our lack of effort? Was it supposed to be some ironic forebearance of the future? Up until that shot I was enthralled by Munich, but I left the theatre angry about the final scene.",1146787200,3,573,4.415094339622642
1542206,5,B00005JOIH,"Politics, especially when its players are so close to home, is a finely drawn tightrope for a filmmaker to cross, but Spielberg has done it with aplomb, originality and respect to all concerned. A complex view of a political situation where no one wins. Israelis and Palestinians are human beings caught up in an impossible and brutal reality. No one is above politics. No one is a beast of pure evil--just fallible, desperate human beings caught up in impossible political realities of which they must take less-than-perfect sides and make less than perfect decisions that affect others. I cringed and cowered at the beginning with Munich scenes. I cringed at the Paris scenes later. I cried inside for the bloodshed being wrought by kin against kin who are being manipulated to fight against each other by the powers that be. Acting and editing at least should have won awards rather than panned by the Oscar committee.

1542228,5,B00005JOIH,"One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel. This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe. But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing ""struggle"" for ""order."" Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time. This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of ""liberty"" and ""property,"" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well. In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.

The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the core of Steven Spielberg's ""Munich."" The massacre of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing. Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded. There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village. Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that ""they're all gone"" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing. But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he has to do and later for what he has done.

Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich. Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them. His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done. Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.

We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed. But the first has translated ""The Arabian Nights"" into Italian. The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich. They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics. But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist? Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.

""Munich"" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.

I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel ""Munich"" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.",1146614400,17,6060,4.670411985018727
1542229,5,B00005JOIH,"First, I will offer a confession. When ""Munich"" first opened in theaters late last year, I was very interested in seeing the film but I was also a bit hesitant. Given the current ""political correct"" atmosphere surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - where anyone who is even remotely critical of Israel is immediately branded a Nazi or anti-Semite - I thought for sure this movie would be nothing but your standard Pro-Zionist/Pro-Jew/Pro-Israeli, anti-Arab propaganda as we get on a nightly basis from the Fox ""News"" Channel. However, I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumptions...

I was pleasantly surprised that Munich is even-handed in its approach and does not resort to a one-sided condemnation of Palestinians and Arabs. The film follows the aftermath of the 1972 massacre of several Israeli athletes by Palestinian gunmen at the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The Israeli government is eager to take revenge for the massacre, and forms a small task force of espionage operatives to carry out the assassinations.

The central question this film forces the viewer to contemplate is whether or not the whole ""eye for an eye"" mentality is productive? Sure, Israel took out the gunmen responsible for Munich, but in turn, gave rise to an even more militant segment of terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah - which led to more retribution against innocent Israelis (entailing more bombings and killings of Palestinans). The cycle goes on and on and on...and nothing is ever solved.

As you watch this movie, do not expect to walk away with any answers. This is not a film that tells you what to think. Instead, it is a movie that forces you to grapple with a very grim subject matter. In my opinion, Munich is to the Israeli-Palestinian  Conflict what Do The Right Thing is to race relations.

I gained so much more respect for Steven Spielberg for having the courage to make this film. As a Jewish American, Spielberg certainly didn't win any friends within the Zionist movement, but he stood up for principal and has given us the most timely, best-made film on terrorism we have ever seen.",1146182400,36,2114,4.943661971830986

1542231,5,B00005JOIH,"What could you expect from a two and a half-hour picture based on actual events and telling about Israeli government avenging their olympic team members killed by palestinian terrorists during Munich Olympic Games of 1972? Well, not a breathtaking, action-packed thriller, that's for sure. I thought it would be long, boring, didactic and over the top pompous. Even the presence of Steven Spielberg's name in the credits couldn't inspire me. Now I'm glad I was wrong on all counts. Yes, it was long, but of that kind when you wish a film had never ended. It's neither boring nor didactic nor pretentious.

Young Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) is given a task to eliminate the members of ""Black September"" terrorist organization with the help of a group of fellow agents. And that's what they do during two hours and a half of the screen time - locating and killing Palestinian terrorists one by one. ""Munich"" could become one of the many political thrillers about confrontation of different countries' intelligence services. It could raise some serious questions of historical importance and be overly-political. But Spielberg did an amazing thing with this global story - he transferred it to the personal level. So this story turned out to be not about countries, governments and intelligence services but about ordinary men. A country's vengeance was laid upon one man's shoulders, and that's how we see it - through his eyes. Along with him we will question the righteousness of his task, we will doubt, we'll see how a revenge appears to be ineffective and reasonless (as it always happens) especially if it's a revenge in a global scale: terrorism is like hydra - you cut one head off and two more emerge in it's place. We see how Avner who dedicated his work and his life to the country he loved ends up feeling useless and knowing that from now on his life is in danger. Furthermore he understands that for the sake of some illusive goal he put at risk the lives of his loved ones - his wife and child. ""Munich"" is the story of another zealous man who was grinded by the millstones of big politics and governmental interests. And finally this story leads to an eternal conclusion that you can't beat violence with more violence. You can deteriorate everything, unleash something you couldn't imagine in your worst nightmares, but you can't defeat violence doing the killings yourself.

Steven Spielberg demonstrated his immense talent again taking this epic and well-known story, drawing some ordinary people out of it and still making grand and philosophical conclusions.

Great film - awesome acting performances, brilliant cinematography (as always by Janusz Kaminski), interesting subject, entertaining yet thoughtful story-line, clear message which is at the same time not obsessive or annoying - prime Spielberg I'd say. Definately one of the best pictires of the last year undeservingly unmarked by the Academy award.",1146182400,65,2932,5.016427104722792
1542232,4,B00005JOIH,"The review is focused mainly on the technical aspect of the this 2-discs edition of ""Munich"" DVD. The four stars is for the film, The behind-the-scenes features are insightful enough, covering sevreal key element of the origin of the story, and the making of the movie. The package is an attractive slip case over a fold-out custom-made digipak (which is miles superior to the single-disc edition), inside there is a 38 pages color booklet consists of photos and praising quotes from critics. However, they still seem somehow lackluster for a hard-to-come-by, much higher-priced ""Limited Edition"".

Most of all, I am very disappointed to see that this so called ""Limited Edition"" has broken the tradition of a string of Speilberg's films by not including the DTS track. In fact, this has been a concern for me with the recent Universal/Dreamworks catalogue. This is someone who back in 2000, set a benchmark for all DVD release with the 2-disc version of ""Gladiator"") A few years back, Universal/Dreamworks DVD never failed to tag on a far superior DTS soundtrack on almost all their DVDs (""Bourne Identity"", ""Shrek"", ""Spy Game"", ""Shindler's List"", ""Minority Report""... to name a few, even to the very recent ""The Terminal"" and ""War of the Worlds""), or at least available as an alternative version of DVD in some earlier cases (""Road to Perdition"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Jurassic Park"", albeit at the expense of losing some extra features). Given that Mr. Speilberg himself was the advocate in DTS technology since 1993 as well as the front of Dreamworks studio, this was no surprise, and very much to the writer's delight. I never had a problem with Spielberg not giving a commentary track, because I could always relied on him to present a quality product (DVD, that is)

But this beloved feature have been unjustly missing in several DVDs that are screaming for its inclusion (""Bourne Supremacy"", ""Serenity"", ""King Kong"" or even ""Shrek 2"" jump to mind). Those readers tasted the high clarity and pulse raising resonance of DTS would understand. Those who haven't, I sincerely urge you to find time to visit a reputable electronic store and ask for a demo. Now I realize there is limited storage capacity on one dual-layer DVD, especially if a higher video transfer rate is in order. But surely, is a French 5.1 necessary? (Sorry, folks who perfer to listen to dubbed French soundtrack. If we were encouraged to watch French films in their original language - and most of us do - I am sure it won't hurt you to try). I admit once in a while it is rather amusing to watch Indiana Jones shouting heroic banters in out-of-sync French, but for the subject matter of ""Munich"", I doubt that anyone would care to try. Besides, the extended version DVDs of ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, each managed to fit in half of its film length (which is, allow me to remind you, pushing two hours), three different soundtracks (Dolby 2.0, Dolby 5.1 EX, and DTS ES 6.1) as well as four full length commentaries, while still keep a stellar visual quality. I am having a hard time believing Universal do not have the technology to compete with that. What puzzles me is that, while home theater equipments are becoming increasingly popular, and most of them are built with DTS compatibility, yet we will not have the option to have the softwares to experience it? We are gradually marching into the era of HD-DVD (or Blueray), yet the studios still expect us to settle with anything less than our home theaters' full potential. I can't help but to feel patronized.

(The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack is actually a Descriptive Voice Service - a narration of the screen for the visual impaired)

I probably won't be surprised to see if there will be an ""Ultimate Commemorative Edition"" not too far down the line (Or even possibly, a HD DVD release that includes everything we get in this package) Frustrating indeed. I only hope Universal will come to grasp on what really makes a ""Limited Edition"" DVD special, understand what a lot of DVD collectors who wish to relive the cinematic experience at home are hoping for. At least, offer an alternative version, so those who long for such feature will have the option.",1145836800,16,4187,4.827298050139276

The movie has very few moments of the Munich tragedy, but revolves more around the plot where ""Avner"" and his team members eliminate the Palestinian terrorists.

Acting by Eric Bana is superb. Spielberg has done the perfect selection for his lead character, which looks fresh on the screen.  I am glad that the theme so intense and serious is handled by the genius and not by some new kid on the block.

""Munich"" is somewhat slow to develop after the opening sequence showing the abduction of the Israeli athletes. I felt I was being indoctrinated with sympathy for the poor suffering Israelis, who everyone hates and can't catch a break. However, Spielberg gradually breaks away from that mode and slowly develops an engaging, suspenseful thriller.

Spielberg creates a very simple ""good guy/bad guy"" conflict as the mission to exterminate members of the Palestinian terrorist group responsible for the Munich Massacre. As the mission progresses, questions get asked and issues are debated. Eventually the audience is left to question their own beliefs about the nature of reaction and retribution.

The film ends with a brilliant speech that reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, yet reflects other conflicts, as well as our current conflict with Iraq and the much larger ""War on Terror"". Spielberg leaves us with a very haunting image of the World Trade Center as the characters discuss the process of action and the inevitable vengeance that follows, questioning whether every action needs a reaction.

On that note, everyone by now seems to realise that it's narrative structure is deeply flawed: how does Avner have flashbacks of what happened at Munich? They cannot possibly be his memories as he wasn't there... A cheap trick to gain an emotional response that unwittingly leaves audiences cold.

It was quite possibly the longest three hours of my life.

It started out interesting enough. The Munich Olympics and the murder of the entire Israeli athletic team was the backstory, and the first few scenes were tense and gory. Then it cut to the Israeli government making plans to take down all the Palestinians involved.

From the first killing, it started to drag. Instead of climaxing to a great kill or a profound political point, it systematically laid out one killing after another. Along the way, Spielberg manages to squeeze in a few suspicious characters, a trip to Lebanon, and a couple of ""Arabs are bad"" sentiments. Nearing the end, I was barely paying attention to the movie. The ending was also a real letdown, as it let the movie grind to a complete stop.

Spielberg followed up the back-to-back ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Terminal"" (basically two lightweight TV Movie of the Week flicks) with a pair of BIG movies that both suffered from weak screenplays. Both ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Munich"" started off impressively, only to drag in the middle under the load each was carrying - which in the case of ""Munich"" was its aspirations to be ""unbiased"" and ""meaningful,"" and for the Tom Cruise ""alienfest"" it was probably the star's bad acting. In the middle of both movies I found myself growing restless and bored, wondering where these movies were going. Both films fizzled out without a satisfying resolution.

""Munich"" has a number of laudable qualities. The cast is uniformly praise-worthy. Only knowing Eric Bana as the star of the sluggish and limp ""Hulk"" movie, I hadn't expected to like his performance, but after watching the film I was surprised that he hadn't been tapped by the Academy with a nomination. I was fascinated by Gila Almagor's performance in the small role of Avner's mother. I was never sure whetehr I was supposed to like her or not, which I found intriguing. I also single out Lynne Cohen from the supporting cast for no other reason than I have long enjoyed her work (""The Station Agent,"" ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" and a plethora of ""Law & Order"" episodes), but everyone did a fine job in this movie. (I admit that I was surprised at this movie's presentation of a weary, resigned-to-the-inevitable Golda Meir, whom I've always imagined to be something of a resolute lioness.)

As with ""War of the Worlds,"" Spielberg does wield immense talent in ""Munich."" The assassination scenes are nail-biters - particularly the one featuring the little girl (no spoilers here), which is reminiscent of Hitchcock's best work. The film also succeeds in inducing paranoia as the audience slowly realizes that there is nothing to keep the hunters from becoming the hunted.

I believe, however, that Spielberg and the screenwriters squandered the film's momentum by sacrificing the story at the altar of a pomposity and political intent. (One need look no further than Spielberg's painfully naive announcement that this movie could lead to the end of the Middle East conflict or screenwriter Kushner's repeated remarks about the ill-advised formation of the nation of Israel and his call for divestment and boycott of Israel to deduce that there was clearly another agenda besides good storytelling.)

For me, the story begins to unravel when it stops to make political comment. The most cloying example of this was a sentimentalized conversation between Bana's character and a PLO terrorist. The implication is that Israelis need to ""step up"" and view their self-preservation tactics with an ""enlightened conscience."" As progressive as it would be to have both sides of the conflict sit in their ""time out chairs,"" this film unfortunately never requires the Palestinian terrorists to question THEIR actions.

I am not against a ""balanced"" view. The scene in which the wonderful Mathieu Kassovitz offers the arguement that the assasins are losing their identity as Jews by engaging in what his character sees as wreckless vengence is a sweetly sensitive moment that captures the best of what Spielberg apparently hoped to communicate. Sadly, it goes unanswered by any similar ""Arab aggita."" There are no scenes in which they agonize over the violence; they ponder neither the global instability for which they are responsible nor their culpability in prolonging the dispute. Wouldn't a scene like that have finally brought ""balance?""

Politics aside, this movie sputters because the storytellers suddenly jump genres - from political thriller to a morality tale. Unfortunately, their manipulation of the story made it difficult for me to make the jump with them.

I was a bit puzzled by the earlier reviewer who somehow found this movie superior to ""Crash,"" which also deals with moral-equivalency in its own way. While ""Munich"" is a polished failure, ""Crash"" is cinematic jewel. It is a well-crafted film with attitude which also takes the audience on a wild ride. ""Crash"" differs from ""Munich"" in that while its issues are also left unresolved, the story offers us a resolution - even if it is an ending which the audience doesn't want to accept. I would suppose that a movie should succeed as a well-told story before it attempts to be a societal catalyst, whatever the cause.",1143936000,3,4731,5.064184852374839
1542299,3,B00005JOIH,"`Munich' starts with a gripping and hauntingly realistic opening sequence about the terrorists attack. The atmospheric film has also some effective moments as thriller, that easily testifies to the fact that Spielberg is one of the greatest storytellers in the world, if not the greatest film director. Still, `Munich' is a failure as thought-provoking drama that it clearly attempts to be.

Ethically questionable, but Hollywood (or any other filmmakers) are certainly entitled to making a thriller out of the real-life tragedy, this case about the shocking deaths of the Israeli athletes. However, you cannot make a film which claims `inspired by the real events' with a clichd plot device like a mysterious French guy `Louis' who sells information like in a spy novel. The assassination team has virtually no trouble in finding out the targets, which is quite unlikely, and though each set-piece is well-constructed, the discerning eye would spot the hackneyed ideas here and there, which are all insult to the intelligence of the audience.

Yes, I know. The film is based on George Jonas book ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team."" As I haven't read the book, I can make no comment on the original source, but judging from the film Spielberg directed, the clandestine team consists of familiar `types' of the characters -- Newly-appointed leader (Eric Bana), trigger happy young male (Daniel Craig), cool and determined veteran (Ciaran Hinds), slightly geeky bomb maker (Mathieu Kassovitz), etc. Luckily the superb acting from the supports (not the lead) such as Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler saves the film's main characters from stereotypes.

As to Eric Bana, though he is no doubt a very talented actor, he was disappointing. Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the team, who has a pregnant wife at home. I would choose a single, unmarried male for doing such a very dangerous job like assassination, but Spielberg must have thought otherwise. Anyway, Bana's Avner is only a boring presence beside the more authentic and nuanced acting from Hines and Geoffrey Rush, and Avner's changing attitudes to the cause of the mission and his identity are barely credible but predictable.

I know some people (who noticed the WTC in the film's New York scenes) argue that the subject matter of terrorism and revenge is very immediate to us. I agree. But still I firmly believe that it is hard for that immediacy to co-exist with the film's entertainment value as thriller which is considerable. Now I come back to the film's great opening and three flashbacks showing what happened to the victims, of which effects are just terrifying because we know the terrible accounts are true. However, for all the insistence to the realism of Spielberg, the following story about the counter-terrorism team lacks the authentic voice of them.",1143072000,2,2857,5.1113490364025695
1542300,4,B00005JOIH,"Technically, the movie is superb with impeccable production quality and impressive direction. Politically, the movie was partial to the Israeli point of view, which is fine since it's told from the Israeli perspective. What bothered me about it, though, was the whole shpiel about negotiating with one's own morals and values to inflict pain and suffering upon others. The movie seems to show that only the Israelis go through this tough moral questioning while the Palestinians don't. I found that to be blatantly rediculous, wrong and irresponsible.

The movie successfully shows the futility of conflict and the pain it continiously inflict on people's psyche and mental health. I especially liked how the Twin Towers were shown in the background toward the end as the Mosad operatives were negotiating carrying out another ""elimination"" operation against Palestinian leaders. The symbolism of it all was striking!

All in all, it's a good movie. Rent it when it comes out.",1142726400,3,976,5.25

1542302,3,B00005JOIH,"Any movie on this highly volatile and flammable topic by default invites curiosity and audience. The movie however turns out be a spaghetti mix that makes a vain attempt to show both the Palestinian and Israeli perspectives.

The protagonist in the form of Avner starts of as a quiet team leader, turns into an obsessive head-hunter, defies initial marching orders and after a near-complete mission suffers from pangs of repentance. The end is too hackneyed for a sensitive, volatile and serious topic.

In my opinion, this movie should have been directed from a reporter's perspective who does not take sides, but very simply reports on the events from a neutral perspective. Judgmental dialogs and rhetoric should be clearly avoided.",1142467200,,735,5.168067226890757
1542303,5,B00005JOIH,"Many people who I have talked to about this movie have become a bit confused as to its plot.  Many people think that it is about the Munich Olympics, and that it is a true story.  Well, like Domino, they should have put ""Based on a True Story: Sort Of.""  The movie is about a group of people hired to assassinate the people responsible for the killings in Munich.  No one knows who these people were or what they did.  The only known fact was that they assassinated most of those responsible for the killings.  So, in effect, Spielberg has fabricated, to the already known facts, a story about what probably would have happened.  That being said, this is one of the best movies of 2005.  In my own Oscar picks, I had Munich winning Best Picture, even though I rated Crash higher on my Top Ten list, becuase of its ingenuity and its originality.  It is a sharp contrast to the other Best Picture nominees, and at some parts the film is extremely bloody and violent.  But Spielberg has crafted a work of art.  Many may try to blow this out of proportion and relate it to Spielberg's politics, but I think this is just a well crafted piece of film.  It also has wonderful performances throughout, although not the best of the year, especially by Bana and Geoffrey Rush, who is always a pleasure to watch.  Spielberg's film did not win any Oscars, but it stands as one of the more underrated, and best, films of the year.",1142121600,2,1417,4.403846153846154
1542304,5,B00005JOIH,"A good friend of mine, and a real film buff, tried to talk herself out of seeing this remarkable and courageous movie.  Don't do it!  Forget everything you've read or heard and judge it on its own merit.  Especially with Spielberg at the helm, this could easily have been ""Avenging Spitzer, Gutfreund, Berger, et al.""  Instead, Spielberg and adapters Roth and Kushner grab us by the scruff of the neck and make us appreciate the human and political cost of the kind of revenge killing that Mossad engaged in after Munich, and that Hollywood loves to peddle (see Harrison Ford in ""Firewall"" for a recent good example).

My purpose in this review is not to much to evaluate the strenghts and weaknesses of the movie (of which there are both) but instead to convince you to make up your own mind, ask your own questions, and actually see the movie instead of pre-judging it.  We need to get past the manifestly silly arguments that the movie fails to take a stand, or on the other hand that it is insufficiently sympathetic to the Israelis or the Palestinians, depending on one's individual orientation.  The film very clearly takes a stand, both personal and political.  (For Tony Kushner, as we saw in ""Angels in America,"" the personal and the political are always intertwined.)  Its stand is that the translation of ideology and/or nationalism into either initiated or responsive acts of violence, always involves a disturbing and ultimately unacceptable human cost.  Wrapped up in this is a remarkable exploration of what constitutes ""home,"" politically or personally.  Notice the constant intertwining of references and images of food, companionship, sex, family, and even the amoral nightmare of a ""family"" committed to providing its dubious services to the highest bidder, completely devoid of any moral choice.  This, too, is part of the ""stand"" that ""Munich"" takes.

One great virtue of the movie is that it never explicitly applies its message to today's situation, in which presmptively innocent people (based on American concepts of jurisprudence) are demoninated ""enemy combatants"" based on mere suspicion, and denied access to legal process or counsel.  Please see this month's Harper's Magazine for an excellent article on the incompatability of western concepts of morality and justice with the currently on-going institutionalization and standardization of the use of torture.

I stayed away from ""Munich"" for a while because I thought it was a little much that two well-off American jews (I am half-jewish) like Spielberg and Kushner (I don't know if Roth is jewish) were wringing their hands about the cycle of violence in the Middle East.  ""Munich"" presents no answers for the current Palestinian situation, and it can well be argued that it is the place of art to raise the questions, not answer them within a convenient 2-hour format.  (If you want quick, neatly-packaged answers like ""we really can all get aong, as Stephen King argues in the current Entertainment Weekly, then ""Crash"" is for you.)  I was unprepared for the philosophical and moral complexity that ""Munich"" presents.  Considering Spielberg's penchant for easy emotional release, making this movie was not only a mature decision artistically but a tremendously courageous one as well.

Before seeing this movie, think about the moving speech made by Burt Lancaster at the end of Judgment at Nuremburg:  it is when times are hardest, when the wolf is at the door, that it is most difficult for a society to cling onto its most cherished notions of fairness, decency, and integrity.  The German people, faced with crisis, allowed their government to turn to barbarism and mass slaughter.  Today, faced with a continuous and uninterrupted ""war"" on terrorism in which more and more seemingly illegal and immoral acts (wiretapping, torture, detention without trial) are tolerated, what does it mean when our country emulates Mossad after Munich, and engages in acts that are characteristic of our ""enemy"" instead of ourselves?  This is the question that ""Munich"" so powerfully and eloquently asks.",1142121600,5,4078,5.125377643504532
1542374,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution.

The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to ""show people we're strong,"" but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy.

This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon.",1141516800,4,1898,5.13915857605178

1542376,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg became a most noble director decades ago, and now, over a thirty-year period, he has progressed into a higher standard, a direction in which aging filmmakers rarely go. I can only name two other directors who have followed the same path-Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese-but Spielberg has marinated in excellence for so long that his wide range of films have each become synonymous with his name, instead of the actors who starred in them. He has conducted a number of great films, a number of thought-provoking masterpieces, in which his brilliance as a director has added a counter resonance to the material he works with. He brought us visitors from outer space on three different occasions. He made dinosaurs walk the earth. He told a vivid World War II drama with a heartfelt passion. There will probably never be another director like him.

And now, he has taken perhaps the boldest move of his career, and probably the greatest risk in the history of filmmaking. This move, which can only be described as the kind you make in a chess match, is ""Munich,"" a dramatic thriller that spawns from the film industry at a time in which its historical context is very much alive. This, I believe, is the movie that Spielberg was born to direct, because alien visitors and prehistoric beasts cannot hold a candle to the importance of what he has brought to the screen. As a Jew himself, he has refused to take sides, which would be difficult to begin with since his countrymen have disowned him and since the Palestinians have likewise denounced him. Instead of criticizing and attacking, he chooses to depict and dramatize, showing that, after all, the continuous ongoing conflict will not be settled by fighting and foreign policy, but by agreement and systematic compromise.

There is even something to be said about the attitude that Spielberg has while behind the camera. ""Munich"" is probably his angriest film to date, while also being his most effective and most powerful. What bubbles to the surface during the story is a graphic critique on terrorism and foreign policy during the last forty years. In context, the lessons that the film teaches us are likely to surface a broad range of emotions in the audience members. We are angry because men, who are, by our definiton, evil, kill innocents. We are saddened because we realize that very little was gained out of the events of the film, and that others may have lost their lives in vain. We are confused by the policies carried out on both sides of the film's struggle. We are frustrated by the different views that the characters hold. If ever there was a film that burdens the audience while also managing to fascinate and engulf, it has to be ""Munich."" This is one of the best films of the year.

Throughout the film, Spielberg puts a well-developed emphasis on the events that took place during the early hours of September 5, 1972, and, in one of the most dramatic sequences of the year, the days that followed. As the film opens, eight members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September break into the Munich Olympic Village and take eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage in their dormitory, killing two in the process. As the media covers the chaos, Avner (Eric Bana), a small-time agent for the Israeli government, and his pregnant wife Daphna (Ayelet Zurer) watch the events unfold on television.

Shortly after the incident, with all of the hostages murdered and the terrorists taken out during a bloody airport shootout, Avner is summoned by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), a high-ranking Israeli intelligence officer, to take a bold and dangerous mission: assassinate eleven men who were apparently behind the tragedy in Munich. He is accompanied by four other men: Steve (Daniel Craig), an opinionated getaway driver, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the clean-up man, Hans (Haans Zischler), who can forge documents, and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who is in charge of explosives. These are ordinary civilian men, save for Avner, who, although he is a favor-man for Israel, has been worn down with the responsibilities of a husband and expectant father. Carl, for example, was an antiques salesman and Robert was a toymaker .

Their mission requires them to move across Europe and locate each person on the list, and to do so Avner enlists the aid of Louis (Mathieu Amalric), whose employees can locate anyone wherever and whenever. With the whereabouts of their targets being generally unknown, getting help from an outside source is not such a bad idea, except for the source doesn't align itself with governments or morality. Later in the film, the group gets the idea that Louis and his men are giving away information on Avner's team, and the dynamics of this possibility begin to plague the men with distrust and paranoia.

What makes the film fascinating is it's exploration of the assassinations themselves and what the five men must do in preparation for each of them. After the first target is taken out with guns in the lobby of his apartment, the team decides to move on to plastic explosives because then you won't have to look the target in the eye. One of the film's most exhilarating moments is when the team, having already planted a bomb in the target's apartment, fails to realize that his daughter has re-entered the house after leaving for school. The gimmick works so that when the telephone rings and is answered, the bomb is armed and can be detonated via a remote control. The girl answers the phone, and Carl, who is making the call from a phone booth several hundred feet away from Robert, Hans, and Steve, is immediately stunned by the voice. Hinds' reaction is exemplary acting, but I want you to notice how Spielberg handles this moment. He doesn't emmulate the soundtrack with exhilirating music, but instead allows no sound at all, as Carl and Avner run in desperation to prevent Robert from detonating the bomb.

Moments like these, and countless others, deliver the kind of jolty suspense that you would expect from Alfred Hitchcock. That's what makes ""Munich"" such an effective thriller, and within it's context are a number of harrowing questions, some of which are asked by the characters themselves. Why must a country compromise it's own values in order to defend them? Are these targets really linked to the Munich massacre? What evidence is there against them? What is being gained out of this? When the Palestinians begin to fight back around the world in response to what Avner and his men are doing, the answer is probably very little. What becomes more important to Avner than the success of his mission is the safety of his wife and child, whom he moves to Brooklyn in order to assure their safety. But as the mission progresses, and as it becomes more dangerous than anticipated, the Munich massacre and it's aftermath begin to haunt Avner's mind mercilessly.

What Spielberg is doing here, I think, is telling us that the conflict in the Middle East can not be solved through violence, because, as we learned last year from David Cronenburg's ""A History of Violence,"" violence begets violence. He is probably saying that violence can only temporarily solve the problem, but even more unrest can materialize on top of the previous layer of conflict. If men on both sides of the battle continue on with their actions, then nothing will be gained and nothing will be solved. The Middle East will remain in a bloody stalemate forever, Spielberg tells us.

He's probably right. Countless other regions of the world are experiencing violence and depravation: Ireland, India, Pakistan, and Africa to name a few. Spielberg uses the Munich incident as a backdrop for rational explanation. He isn't pointing fingers, making accusations, or blurting out criticisms, but is instead observing and utilizing as only a master storyteller can. He is also not looking for any answers. He's only reminding us of the harsh reality that some humans cannot live in peace, but must instead resort to violence in order to achieve personal gain.

And this still rings true today. Because we see these events through Avner's eyes, and because Bana plays him so well, we understand him as a human begin with human concerns instead of a gun-welding hero out for a kill. As ""Munich"" progresses towards it's ending, we realize that Avner is every human being on the planet characterized into one person. He wants answers to what is going on in the world and he isn't getting any. That's what makes the film so appropriate, and Spielberg makes the film appropriate by ending it with an image so haunting in it's surrealism that it speaks volumes on it's own. It also reminds us that sometimes the people standing on the sidelines can get hurled into the game.

1542377,4,B00005JOIH,"I had read about the controversy surrounding this film and was really interested in seeing how this film would turn out. I had read that perhaps the story behind this film was made up despite protestations that they had accurate resources. Obviously other reviewers here have reviewed the movie in greater detail but I have to say I enjoyed it immensely. I was surprised by the audacity that Spielberg went to make this film. Yes I know he made Schindler's List but for me he's always been more interested in crowd-pleasers. This however seemed like a labour of love. The scenery is shot so beautifully, that it's quite breathtaking. You get into the minds of these people, their fear, their doubts, their paranoias. Most of all their beliefs too. And when they have to commit something their conscience would usually tell them not to do, that is what is interesting. It was interesting to see how people's beliefs drive them to do something they wouldn't normally do - how they feel for their families they have to leave behind and may never see again. How even sleeping on a bed is a killer. The fact that these memories remain in their minds is something they have to live with. The feeling that they could be constantly in jeopardy. How politics can sometimes can get in the way of religion or even play a part in politics. It's an endless game that no one wins and the only loss can be somebody's life. It's to Spielberg's credit that he made a film like this that questions people's beliefs and whether the interpretations people get out of them are really true. A masterpiece of film making. Well worth investigating even if you might not agree with what the film's message intends to be. However these are just my thoughts, yours can be totally different to what I have just put down.

1542378,1,B00005JOIH,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've had to sit through in recent years. Despite the great hype surrounding the movie (largely generated by clever and misleading advertising), it fails on all fronts. The story unfolds in a slow and predictable fashion. Long periods of boredom are punctuated by scenes of gruesome, graphic violence that are much better suited for a horror film. The movie revels in this brutality to such an extent that the real message is lost. In as much, it becomes what it pretends to condemn - senseless violence. There is most definitely a deep and compelling meaning in this sad real-life story, but, as usual, Speilberg fails to find it.",1140393600,13,677,4.745762711864407
1542379,4,B00005JOIH,"It was much to bear to watch the eleven Israeli athletes of the 1972 Olympic Games slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, just as they had primed their young bodies and minds to a state of physical strength and endurance in Stephen Spielberg's, ""Munich"", but the carnage doesn't stop there, and if you brace yourself for the awful scenes of the athlete's assassinations, you still have to endure the slow death walk and gurgling bleed of a half naked enemy spy prostitute, and other agonizing deaths which possess a morbid fascination, the kind teenagers in the horror flick audience would find, ""cool"", and ""awesome"". It's often a Night of The Very Nearly Living Dead, as gunshot victims momentarily carry out their final acts, as if unaware of bullet holes through their foreheads and chests, until blood protrudes from them like ketchup released from a stuck bottle. Why this fascination with gore, is beyond me. Maybe it serves as companion to the horrific details of the film's inspiration, suggesting the expectations and perpetual motion of the Istraeli athletes were snuffed like a spent Olympian torch.

It's a difficult film, given it's ""inspired by true events"" lead-in. With a free hand to examine the Munich execututions, Spielberg delivers an assured sense of actuality in depicting the State of Israel, seeking revenge against, as opposed to overwhelming, terrorism, and in finding the revenge seeking, justice fighters greatly outclassed in the world of high end spies and assassins. Their secret mission is exposed a number of times due to emotion level tactics, they fall prey to an obvious, seductive counter-assassin, they harbor a mole, and offer outragous sums of money to contacts for information. They mostly 'get their man', so to speak, but we could have told them the cost of terrorism is more terrorism.

Without the historic events, ""Munich"" would make a fantastic espionage thriller. In detailing the history with a flair for the sensational, Spielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history. As The World Trade Center towers in the New York City skyline via trick photography near film's end, Spielberg tells us, history will repeat itself. His film's main objective is the conclusion that America did not do enough to support Israel's sense of justice regarding the Munich assassinations.

Anyway you look at it, it's a film that shouldn't be missed.",1140307200,2,2498,5.117647058823529
1542380,2,B00005JOIH,"The stage seems to be set for what at first glance would appear to be one of the most politically scathing awards ceremonies in years, the 78th Annual Academy Awards presentation on the ABC television network. No, this is not due in part to the announcement that the Daily Show's Jon Stewart will host the program. This is just another clear sign that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has truly lost touch with its core audience and have reverted to catering to the whims of sniveling television executives eager to lure younger adults, albeit for a few short moments, to contribute to their key demo-rating. It is instead the potential motion picture nominees themselves that will have everyone talking. There is director Ang Lee's controversial gay-cowboy picture, Brokeback Mountain, a film likely to arouse (no sexual pun intended) the pro-gay marriage advocates of California's certifiable liberal base. Here's a puzzler - how does Ang Lee go from directing The Hulk to a romantic-drama about homosexual cowboys in Wyoming? George Clooney, perennial poster boy for the Hollywood left, has two politically controversial pictures up his sleeve - the anti-Joseph McCarthy diatribe, Good Night and Good Luck, and director Stephen Gaghan's `blood for oil' leftist pamphlet piece, Syriana. If you can't recall who Stephen Gaghan is, he directed the Oscar nominated film, Traffic. Can't recall Traffic either? Don't worry, more then likely no one else can either. And what would the Academy Awards be without a tribute to the false-state of Palestine? This year the spineless Europeans honor Palestinian suicide bombers with their foreign-language contribution, Paradise Now. Yes, the same homicidal maniacs who have made the Middle East region the certifiable blood bath it is today. There is no word at this time as to whether film distributor Warner Independent Pictures has chosen to follow former-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's lead and compensate families of suicide bombers. However, it appears that the most controversial of them all is director Steven Spielberg's `semi-historical' drama, Munich, a portrayal of the events following the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Pro-Israeli advocates, not to mention the Israeli population in general, have come down hard on the Academy Award-winning director of Schindler's List, a tribute to the innocent victims of the Holocaust during World War II, going so far as to claim publicly that he is no longer a `friend of Israel'. My, how times have changed.

Saying the least about it, the story for Munich is perfect. Perfect that is in the sense that is nothing short of a flawless piece of revisionist history drawn from the pulpit of self-loathing Jews, Palestinian terrorists, and the liberal rhetoric of Hollywood elitists. Steven Spielberg's Munich has two fundamental flaws going against it in terms of the film's claim of historical accuracy and legitimacy. First, the George Jonas novel, Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, on which the script is primarily based upon, has been widely discredited leaving most historical and literary critics to regard its contents as a work of complete fiction. Jonas fails to support claims by Yuval Aviv that he was the inspiration for Avner and that he participated in Mossad operations to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists involved with the Munich massacre with either interviews or public statements. Ha'aretz journalist Yossi Melman revealed that Aviv, through investigative reports, ""had a special fondness for conspiracy theories, and it turned out that he was willing to hire out his services to anyone who was willing to pay"". The other tragic flaw of this film is playwright Tony Kushner, an openly gay and admittedly self-loathing Jew, who was brought in personally by director Steven Spielberg to rewrite the script originally penned by Eric Roth. Kushner has stated that the creation of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948 was a ""historical, moral, political calamity"" for the Jewish people and believes adamantly that the sole intent of the Israeli government is to ""systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people"".

Lest it be forgotten, let us make one thing perfectly clear - there never was nor will there ever be a nation called Palestine. The term `Palestine' is a modern word used to define the Middle East legion which prior to World War I was a loose association of Arab tribes which would eventually be placed under the yoke of Nazi imperialism during World War II. The British in 1917 promised the Jews the formation of their own nation, Israel, with the signing of the Balfour Declaration, a promise which was eventually upheld in 1948. There exists no Palestinian `refugee problem' today because refugees can not exist if there is no land from which they happen to be displaced from to begin with. The disdainful Arab nations which encircle the entire nation-state of Israel refuse to take in their own so that they may be used as a prominent example of the `atrocities' the Jews have committed and that Israel may forever be used as a scapegoat for their cruelty and malice.

Overall, Munich, albeit skillfully choreographed, suitably acted out, and brilliantly scored by long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, lacks the sufficient credibility in its anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian rhetoric driven storyline to make it a truly riveting historical drama. Munich's most glaring weakness, Kushner's screenplay, is so extreme in its revisionist interpretation of historical events it is likely to maker even pseudo-`documentarian' Michael Moore blush. Frankly the film is not all bad. Spielberg went to extraordinary lengths in the short few months of its production (filming began in July 2005, days after his two-hundred million dollar blockbuster, War of the Worlds, opened in theatres) to have nearly every scene in Munich reflect the styles, the culture, and the atmospheric feel of the 1970s.

First off, much to the embarrassment of Judaism in general, Spielberg and Kushner establish a level of confusion with their own twisted sense of moral relativism when it comes to the interpretation of the specific values and principles on which the Jewish religion is founded upon, an action which is hardly surprising given their fall out from their homeland. After an all too brief scene in which the Israeli athletes in Munich are taken hostage by terrorist agents of Black September, Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir is seen meeting with Israeli officials to construct a plan of retaliation against the Palestinians for the massacre. In this meeting she states, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"", which of course is in reference to Israel's plans to assassinate suspected members of the terrorist organization, Black September. Although Spielberg and Kushner would like it to appear as though the Jews are doing exactly that in responding to the blatant act of terrorism in Munich, this is in fact far from the truth. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an entertainment reporter for Belief.net, in his assessment of the Spielberg picture clarifies on this issue, ""The Talmud [a record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories] clearly establishes that one who comes to murder you must first be killed themselves. Those who have devoted their lives to killing innocent people have erased the image of God from their countenances and have therefore erased their right to life"". It is rather Christianity which advocates the concept of `turning the other cheek' against your enemies and even then it does no such thing in suggesting that total submission be taken whenever a force seeks to commit harm against you or your loved ones.

The false Golda Meir, a woman who in her historical context was the Margaret Thatcher of the newly founded Jewish state, offers further words of wisdom. When an Israeli official questions how this action of retaliation against the Palestinians will corrupt efforts for peace in the region, she argues, ""forget peace for now, we have to be strong"". Peace and strength, while distinctly different entities, are in no way incompatible with each other contrary to popular liberal mythology. Strength would hardly be an option had Al Gore been elected president when September 11th occurred, nor would there be peace. Terrorists, particularly al Qaeda, prey upon the indecisive, the timid, the weak and exploit peace deals and negotiation efforts to their utmost advantage as President Jimmy Carter can clearly vouch for. Any time in which Israel or the United States of America have flexed their muscles and stood up to those who seek to destroy our very way of life, only then have we gained the respect of the world. They may not like us for it, but we have garnered to respect.

In his screenplay Kushner then proceeds to scold Israel for the bombing of Palestinian `refugee camps' in Syria and Lebanon four days following the Munich massacre which killed two-hundred people. And yet he fails to mention that two years earlier Jordan slaughtered ten-thousand Palestinians with the surviving refugees fleeing to the West Bank in Israel. This act was the true inspiration for the terrorist organization behind the Munich massacre, Black September.

The tragic events of the Munich massacre which took place on September 5th, 1972, are never shown in their entirety together. Rather they are spread throughout the two hour and twenty minute motion picture. Most distressing and disturbing of all, the actual slaughter of the nine remaining Israeli athletes in the midst of a failed rescue attempt by German authorities is spliced with scenes of Avner having sex with his wife. The actual climax of the massacre is Avner literally climaxing. It is here that Spielberg as a filmmaker makes his most egregious error. Rather then memorialize the unmitigated slaughter of these eleven Israeli athletes with a proper theatrical tribute he instead chooses to trivialize their deaths, shaping events to his liking so they suit his agenda. The separation of the actual massacre of the Israeli athletes from the beginning of the film drives home Spielberg's point that `violence begets violence, blood begets blood' and that the Munich massacre was merely a response to a response. Spielberg in his Judaist backpedaling fails to acknowledge what exactly the Palestinian kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes was in response to but, as with most leftist revisionist history, facts and the truth are merely an afterthought.

Furthermore, Spielberg in his depiction of historical events which soon followed the Munich massacre conspicuously leave out important details and significantly alter audience's perceptions of the state of Israel. This includes the Arab nations at the Munich Olympics who refused to lower their flags to half-staff in light of the tragedy, essentially endorsing Black September and the terrorist attack which took place there. And let's not forget the International Olympic Committee's refusal to construct a permanent memorial to the eleven slain Israeli athletes out of fear of `offending' those hostile to Israel. More importantly however Spielberg chooses to depict the response to the Munich massacre, in this case the assassination of eleven individuals in connection to Black September, as immediate and unrelenting when in fact it was never initialized until after October 29th, 1972, when Germany released the three surviving Black September kidnappers after a German jet carrying them was hijacked. The Germans suspiciously did this so that the three survivors would not face trial and implicate the German government, still reeling from fall out of the Holocaust during World War II, for the haphazard response.

Although it is Spielberg's intention to place the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team agents on the same moral footing as the Palestinian terrorists of Black September and the PLO, each group's portrayal in the film is significantly different. Only one of the three targets the Mossad agents pursue is shown committing the loathsome acts of terrorism for which they are accused. Instead they are portrayed as either kindly old men or inoperative political activists with adorable children. The Mossad agents are not given such a luxury. They are seen basking in the deaths of those they target. They scrutinize over every dollar spent in pursuit of their objectives. And one agent's tilted argument, ""The only blood that matter to me is Jewish blood"", in response to another agent questioning the amount of collateral damage their bombs meant for their targets may cause shows them to be fideists. They are everything short of complete and utter monsters.

True, Spielberg falls short of portraying the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team as total miscreations. For example, Avner and a fellow agent risk blowing their cover when they realize that a call received by the phone built with a remote detonator explosive placed in the target's apartment has been answered by the target's young daughter and alert their other team members waiting in a nearby car to abort the mission. In spite of evidence in the film to suggest that the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team avoided as much collateral damage as physically possible, risking their lives just to confirm the identity of their target via matching photos with the suspects' faces before they are killed, Spielberg in the end argues that these assassinations were all for naught. Since so few of the targets who were killed had direct links to the Munich massacre, though they were undoubtedly in some form or another associated with the PLO, the only contribution their deaths made was in the creation of more terrorists who were even worse then the ones Mossad eliminated in the first place. This is the same demented, twisted logic the rhetorical left uses in opposing U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their suggestion that going after terrorists for the slaughter of innocent civilians will only lead to more aggressive attacks on our own soil is laughably preposterous. They would rather have our head buried in the ground with our butts high in the air just waiting for the other shoe of Islamic fascism to come down on us rather then respond to it. Let's get something straight here - killing terrorists does not create more terrorists. Did killing Nazis during World War II create more Nazis? Did arresting Klu Klux Klan members create more Klansmen? No, so why would it be any different in this situation? It is a tragically flawed logic; one sadly the radical left in this country seems intent on sticking to. In that case, let us no longer try and prevent murder, rape, underage sex, substance abuse, child molestation, or any crime whatsoever because apparently any effort we make to prevent such activities will only create more rapists, murderers, drug users, and terrorists, so it is best just to let it sort itself out.

This brings us to what is unquestionably the most insulting image in Munich. In the final scene of the film Avner, played by Troy's Eric Bana, meets with Ephraim, his Mossad handler, in a park and tells him he can no longer return to Israel because it is not the moral haven it once was. As the two depart, the camera slowly pans over a 1970s New York City skyline and remains transfixed for a time on the haunting image of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. It does not take a genius to figure out what Spielberg and Kushner mean to suggest here. September 11th is our Munich. A response to a response - nothing more. They mean to suggest that the tragic deaths of both the eleven Israeli athletes in Munich and the nearly three thousand American citizens in NYC, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania were brought upon ourselves. Their lives should be honored, yes, but not in response against those who committed these acts of treachery. Heaven knows, why bother battling cancer if a cure has yet to be found. Better to succumb to despair and die with `dignity' then fight to the bitter end and only make a dent in it. What honor is there in that? For those on the left who like the five year old children they mirror with their petty partisan squabbling who have yet to grasp the concept of sarcasm, everything!",1139961600,17,16427,5.134902840059791
1542381,3,B00005JOIH,"When I saw this movie with my college buddies I was expecting a very intelligent real life story.  I got exactly what I expected.  Eric Bana was very good in this movie and Daniel Craig was his usual self as in Layer Cake and Enduring Love.  Direction was brilliant and real, with very life like stabbing in the head moment and woman getting shot in the chest bit.  There was a lot of talking in this movie which was needed, but I found that all of the long talking scenes where quite boring to me.

Overall this movie had no emotion or heart.  I didn't care about the characters and found the movie too long.  It was good, but nothing special.",1139961600,3,644,4.2727272727272725

1542383,3,B00005JOIH,"One of the reviews posted here bashes the movie as tripe. Well, Spielberg has his style which you may like or not, but it doesn't degrade the substance of the story, perhaps only the form which, again, is a matter of preference and taste. The bottom line in this movie is that the eternal feud between the parties involved has no resolution in sight as long as the (meaningless) violence is a part of equation. The movie doesn't take sides, but just shows the futility of violence on both sides. That is why it has enraged both parties who criticized Spielberg heavily. In that respect, the movie hits the nail on the head, but of course should not be compared with another format, i.e. a documentary ""On Day in September"" which is a must see, and in a way complements this work of SS et al. I give it three stars for the idea, but Spielberg's commercal and somewhat routine execution is not my kind of a movie language.",1139356800,3,920,4.449704142011834
1542450,5,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" is a thoroughly engrossing film.  It is a thoughtful production with great performances by Eric Bana in the lead role as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as his handler, Efraim, and Lynne Cohen as Golda Meir.  Bana's effort alone is worthy of an Oscar.

Yet what distinguishes this film from the usual thriller is its ambiguities.  Killing the bad guy is more than just a few gun shots and the matter is solved.  Avner leads a team killers seeking retribution from the brains of the Munich tragedy.  He is determined to fulfil his task but this doesn't stop him from having doubts.  In short, the man has scruples.

In the US, many have criticised this ambiguity.  However, rather than seeing it as a weakness, I regard it as part of the film's strength.  All killings must involve doubt.  It is a particularly ruthless person who could behave otherwise.  Steven Spielberg has done the world a service by showing that events are rarely black and white.  Shades of grey are inevitable.",1139097600,5,981,4.733727810650888
1542451,5,B00005JOIH,"One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel.  This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe.  But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing ""struggle"" for ""order.""  Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time.  This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of ""liberty"" and ""property,"" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well.  In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.

The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the heart of Steven Spielberg's ""Munich.""  The massacre of the Israeli athletes as the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing.  Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded.  There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village.  Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that ""they're all gone"" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing.  But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he had to do and later for what he has done.

Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich.  Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them.  His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done.  Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.

We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed.  The first has translated ""The Arabian Nights"" into Italian.  The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich.  They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics.  But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist?  Avren gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avren knows.  Meanwhile, as Avren and his men cross more names off of the their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.

""Munich"" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre.  What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich.  The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable.  While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible.  But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members.  Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home.  Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.

I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God.  Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God.  The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better.  It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight.  The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing.  What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel ""Munich"" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.",1139011200,6,6091,4.671348314606742
1542452,5,B00005JOIH,"This is undoubtedly one of the most human films I have ever seen. It may seem strange to say this in the face of so much inhumanity, but what I found extraordinary about this Spielberg masterpiece is his ability to show us personal tragedy when we think there could be no greater tragedy than being confronted with evil; evil that we often perpetrate against those of our own kind.

I respect Spielberg's courage for wishing to present the aftermath of this Olympic massacre in the way he did. Although he took poetic license with George Jason's book, Vengeance, which inspired this film and which I have read, by including a conversation between Avner (Eric Bana) and a Palestinian in the stairs of a safeway house, I think it was important he do so in his quest to put a human face on what must be called a terrible business.

It is perhaps inevitable to wish for retribution, but, no matter how we look at it, retribution always exacts a price, and a very personal one, from those who must engage in it.

Can a man of conscience kill, even if he thinks himself justified in doing so, without remorse? I think not. We are not animals, after all, otherwise why would we have such deep respect for those, like Gandhi, or Mother Teresa who lived their lives with compassion.

So, why is this film important? Because it examines how someone, who could be any of us because he must do what he must do, must reconcile violence with his personal aspirations to peace of mind.

Eric Bana deserves an oscar for his portrayal of a man, who because of the deep tenderess he has for his wife and infant child, appears a gentle soul, and, yet, seems capable of the kind of violence demanded by the retribution his patriotic duty imposes upon him.

That is what makes this film so powerful. In war, of any kind, it is all too easy to forget that we are always dealing with human beings. Munich by Steven Spielberg never lets us forget it.",1139011200,4,1926,4.488571428571428
1542453,5,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" may sound like either a depressing and violent drama to some people, and to others it may sound like a stupid revenge thriller. When I first heard about the movie, I scoffed at the very idea. I thought it would be distastefull to market a movie off the unfortunate people that lost their lives in the Munich Massacre. As it turns out, the movie is alot better that anyone could have anticipated. It has scenes of almost funny innocence between the five assassins, and then sequences of violent assassinations almost a second later.

One of the good things about ""Munich"" is that is doesn't ever try to be something it's not. It never tries to be an action movie, and rightfully it shouldn't be one. However, it rather naturally forms into one on the later half with three extended shootout sequences. As soon as the word ""raid"" was mentioned, I rolled my eyes and thought ""Great, another great movie that takes a nose dive in the last half!"" But that's not what happened. Instead they felt important to the plot, as did everything else in the movie. Except the nudity.

Now, I'm not sure whether this was some symbolism (all violence, in the end, is stripped down to nothing, therefore worth nothing?) or maybe Speilberg, after a long string of PG-13 movies, may have gotten a little...I don't want to say perverted...crazy? I'm not really sure, but the movie incorporates nudity into three, count them three, violent scenes. In one a man is shot and they show it all. In another a woman is shot and when a man tries to cover her with a robe, another man  tells him not to, revealing everything. In another scene, a bomb goes off in a hotel, blowing out the walls to adjacent hotel rooms. A woman in one of the rooms is topless as she runs out of the hotel. As hard as I tried I found nothing that related to the lot with these scenes. But anywho.

""Munich"" seems to have a mordant sense of humor, which fits well here. In one scene, a fellow assassin congratulates the team leader, Avner (Eric Bana), on the birth of his child. ""Mozeltov"", says the man, continuing on. ""Oh, and by the way. The doctor succumbed to his wounds. Once again. Mozeltov."" In a scene towards the end, Avner and his wife are in bed and he flahes back to the Munich Massacre, incorporating his face onto one of the assassins and one of the victims. This wan't so much funny as creepy, but I felt it was worth a mention.

The plot of ""Munich"" follows five Mossad agents sent to dispatch all eleven people responsible for the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre. The five men are Avner, the leader of the group, Steve (Daniel Craig), the getaway driver, Carl (Ciaran Hines), Robert (Matheiu Kassovitz), the bomb maker, and Hans (Hanns Zischler). The movie takes it's time getting to the main plot, because when the movie enters the third hour there are still two people to get rid of. The group travels throughout Europe, killing the planners of the tragedy. Most of this is done with guns, although they have been urged by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) to use bombs. But that idea seems to be dropped after Avner is almost blown to bits early in the movie.

Speilberg spends the first twenty minutes of the movie on the kidnapping of the athletes, their hostage taking, and the subsequent trip to the airport. These twenty minutes are stark and feel very real. There is an eery image of a man in a ski mask walking out onto the balcony of one of the dormatories that is now infamous. Speilberg makes this all the eerier as we see it from inside the dormatory. Throughout the scene we hear several news commentators giving their perspective on what is going on, which is at some times sadly off the mark, but ironically funny at the same time. As the camera focuses on the bullet ridden body of an athlete we hear a newscaster say ""We are told all of the athletes are alright, and will be until an attempt is made to rescue them.""

Later in the opening, the athletes are taken to the Munich airport, where they were killed later that morning. What we see (at first-later in the movie, towards the end, we see the killings) is an explosian and a newscaster saying that all the terrorists have been killed. Seconds later, we see a grainy news clip of Jim McKay broadcasting, announcing ""They're all gone."" This is by far one of the best sequences in the movie, totally surpassing the second best one in the movie, the great sequence at the airport at the end. In the scene, which is done with no dialogue, the terrorists try to get away with the hostages but fail, resulting in the deaths of all the hostages and many of the kidnappers. Mayhem breaks out, and it shows how what should have gone smoothly was screwed by a shoddy attempt at a rescue. For a much better, but one sided, view of the situation itself, not the aftermath, the documentry ""21 Hours In Munich"" will probably give you what you want and a little more. I enjoyed it, but I liked this more.

This is the best movie of the year and here's why. The acting is flawless, right down to a great scene where Avner speaks to his daughter over the phone for the first time (""You never forget daddy's voice. Never. You may never know daddy, but you'll know his voice."") The direction is great, with no overly dizzying camera movements, and the lighting is first class, dark when it needs to be but still very easy to see. The assassination planning scenes do get a bit old after, like, the fifth time, but there are only I think six so it doesn't have time to wear to bad. I think that if you give the movie a chance, and go in with an open mind, you will love it,

1542454,5,B00005JOIH,"Well, you can't argue with success.  I saw ""Munich"" a couple weeks ago and thought it was such a powerful film that I instantly declared it to be both the best movie of the year and Steven Spielberg's best movie since ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Alas, the opinion of a lowly history-studying college student means little.  As of today, ""Munich"" has only grossed $40 million and is shaping up to be one of the biggest commercial flops of Spielberg's career.  By contrast, ""Big Momma's House 2""- the wretched sequel to the already unfunny original- grossed nearly as much in its first three days of release.  Hence why I continue to comment on Americans' love of mediocrity.

Why has ""Munich"" debuted to such a mixed reaction?  It is admittedly a difficult film to watch.  So was ""Schindler's List,"" but ""Munich"" is admittedly less of a milestone, and hence is lacking the publicity it would need to still pull people in.  However, this is still a fast-paced, well-acted, and powerful piece of cinema, and for those reasons alone is a good way to spend two and a half hours (that just breeze by).  However, it is also a frighteningly timely warning about the dangers and moral ambiguities that inevitably accompany a war on terrorism, and how quickly simple vengeance can devolve into borderline murder.

Spielberg has not been this focused in a long time- none of his 00's work approaches the quality seen here (with the exception of ""Catch Me if You Can,"" which was much lighter fare).  Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as a man who is friendly and righteous at first but who is quickly consumed by paranoia and the guilt of ignoring his conscience (and this is coming from someone who also loved him in ""Hulk"" and ""Troy"").  Daniel Craig seethes fury beneath a calm exterior.  Geoffrey Rush proves that, in spite of his familiarity now, he can still blend into any role with ease.  The rest of Bana's team are given compelling back stories, and all struggle to conform their moral compasses with the assassin work they're given.  There are scenes here I will never forget- a desparate attempt to save the life of a child suddenly caught in the way of an assassination attempt, the brutal revenge murder of a woman, the scenes of a man making love to his wife while also being unable to stop thinking about the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich.  From the opening scenes, ""Munich"" grabs you and never lets go (if you'll forgive that cliched expression, it's appropriate here).

More than any other movie this year, ""Munich"" made an impression psyche that no amount of box office indifference in the world can change.  It aspires to be something more than entertainment, and it succeeds on nearly every level.  Here's hoping that it has a ""Fight Club""-like fate and finds its audience on DVD.",1138492800,4,2811,4.73305954825462
1542455,3,B00005JOIH,"According to Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Steven Spielberg commissioned three scripts for MUNICH: one from David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, one from Charles Randolph, and one from Eric Roth. Roth's script was chosen and subsequently revised by Tony Kushner. But he needent have bothered. Instead investing in so many writers and buying the movie rights to George Jonas' book ""Vengeance,"" Spielberg should have simply used the script from the made-for-TV SWORD OF GIDEON.

Even though seven out of ten professional critics rave about Steven Spielberg's MUNICH, for me it was a big disappointment. That's because I had seen its forgotten predecessor, SWORD OF GIDEON made for HBO cable TV in 1986.

Spielberg's movie was a frustrating dj vu experience because it had clearly followed much of the SWORD OF GIDEON story. Both movies were based George Jonas' book ""Vengeance."" But MUNICH lacks the excitement and especially character development of the SWORD OF GIDEON. Oddly enough, none of the ""professional"" movie critics seemed to have recognized that MUNICH is seemingly a failed remake of SWORD OF GIDEON. Accordingly, the two movies must be compared -- here.

MUNICH is not such a terrible movie but it simply doesn't come up to Spielberg's usual standards. Based on actual events, the movie begins with and often flashes back to the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre of eleven Israeli athletes and coaches. Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic village in Munich and captured several Israeli athletes. After the German police tried to intervene, the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists, most of whom were also killed.

Prime Minister Golda Meir's Israeli government is horrified and quickly set plans into motion for punishing those who had planned and executed the massacre. Israel had always denied putting an assassination plan into action. But what happens next is the way legends tell it.

In the movie, an assassination team of dedicated men is assigned to avenge the athlete's deaths. A rather young Avner (flatly played by Eric Bana) is ambiguously introduced as a government bureaucrat who is chosen to lead the team, albeit he is a married man with a pregnant wife. Avner is controlled by Mossad's Ephraim (fairly convincingly acted by Geoffrey Rush). Avner and his team are given a dangerous, secret mission requiring hard hearts and nerves of steel. They must locate, hunt down and kill the architects of the Munich Olympic Massacre -- and never put anyone else into danger.

Spielberg's hopeless effort to be fair to both the Israeli hit squad and also the Palestinian terrorists is a major weakness of MUNICH. At times, Spielberg lets the Palestinians state their case. But given the circumstances of the massacre in Munich, this is impossible. Indeed, by the movie trying to be fair it waters down the anti-terrorism message which the film seems to present.

Just imagine a movie trying to give the 19 mostly Saudis who carried out the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the U.S. a platform for presenting THEIR case. Maybe for trying to clearly assert his anti-terroist position, Spielberg's closing scene dwells on a panoramic view of New York City's skyline; focusing our attention on the the 1970s twin World Trade Center -- smack in the middle of the screen.

Eric Bana plays Avner singularly uncharismatically. Neither Bana's role in BLACK HAWK DOWN nor as THE INCREDIBLE HULK showed good acting skills. Maybe in (the Brad Pitt) movie TROY in which Bana plays Hector, he generated empathy from the audience. But not in MUNICH. Also, Spielberg only let the Avner undergo character changes in the last 15-20 minutes of MUNICH. So then maybe Bana's unsympathetic Avner isn't completely the actor's fault.

MUNICH can be considered an important movie because of its subject, and because it was made by Steven Spielberg -- maybe. But the disjointed -- sometimes illogical -- scenes, emotional coldness of the movie, the silliness of trying to treat both the Palestinians and Israelis evenhandedly, plus a not very attractive lead actor makes this one of Spielberg's worst movies. Sorry.

Director Michael Anderson's the SWORD OF GIDEON (he also made AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, 1956; MILLENNIUM, 1989), like Spielberg's MUNICH, is based on George Jonas' book ""Vengeance."" But, by contrast, Anderson's script and direction are excellent. Plus with such familiar and well-seasoned actors as Rod Steiger, Michael York, and Colleen Dewhurst the SWORD OF GIDEON is exceptionally well cast. The cinematography is also excellent with stunning scenes from locations in Israel, London, and all across Europe.

In SWORD OF GIDEON, Avner (played by the then sexy and sympathetic Steven Bauer) is a skilled commando leader in the Israeli army. Indeed, the movie opens with Avner leading a practice raid in the desert that devastates an ""enemy"" fortress. We get an early sampling of Avner's deadly yet nice guy bravery. Also, he is the son of an embittered former government agent (convincingly played by John Hirsch).

As in Spielberg's version, Mossad (Israel's version of the CIA), secretly aided by Golda Meir and her cookies and tea, recruits Avner as a counter-terrorist. His contact, Mossad's Mordechai (Rod Steiger) recommends him to lead an international hit squad to kill the terrorists who had master minded the 1972 Olympic Massacre in Munich.

Although Avner is made leader (the only combat-hardened soldier), others on the Jewish assassination squad have a lot more espionage experience. An Englishman Robert (Michael York) is an expert in explosives, the Frenchman Jean (Laurent Malet) is a professional race car driver, the sensitive German Hans (Robert Joy) is an experienced hit man, while the older German Carl (Peter Dvorsky) is the ""sweeper"" who removes all the evidence from their hits.

Colleen Dewhurst briefly, perfectly plays Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. Leslie Hope plays Avner's attractive, pregnant wife. Maybe SWORD OF GIDEON tries too hard to get sympathy for Avner's hit squad with its excessive hand wringing and remorseful dialogue. They not only mourn their fallen comrades but also weep for their targets' families. But Mossad's Mordechai (played with creepy cynicism by Steiger) comes across as a sinister, cold-blooded character. Mordechai is probably an amalgam of several real life Mossad leaders.

A very serious deficiency in Spielberg's movie is completely neglecting Avner's relationsip with his father -- convincingly played by John Hirsch in SWORD OF GIDEON. When Avner's father learns that Avner took the Mossad assignment, he becomes extremely angry and alienated: ""You'll see! They'll screw you the same way they screwed me!""  But then -- still the loving father -- he gives Avner the name and telephone number of a French ""asset"" who's simply called Papa, in case Avner needs ""special"" help in Paris. ""You must always have at least one Joker up your sleeve when you work for the Mossad. Papa is that Joker,"" warns Avner's father.

In Spielberg's MUNICH the French Papa occupies a pivotal role, but  he are never allows us to know how Avner, his father and the French informant are connected. We never learn in MUNICH that the French Papa owes a very big favor to Avner's father (who had rotted in prison instead of Papa). That's why Papa shocks his own spook team by bending the rules of espionage for Avner.

In MUNICH there is a lot of dialogue between Avner and Papa about loyalty to one's father and family. But without knowing the relationship among the three men, Papa's all knowing, dramatic speech is totally out of context. At a critical point in Spielberg's film, a very nervous Avner asks Papa (without getting an answer), ""How did you know my name?"" How indeed?! [you'd have to see SWORD OF GIDEON to find out!]

The scenes in SWORD OF GIDEON are filled with mounting tension, especially when the explosives expert Robert is checking out their safe house in Paris for booby traps. Despite its minor limitations (maybe the result of its made-for-TV), SWORD OF GIDEON is a spy thriller with a lot greater intelligence than most of the others in this genre -- including MUNICH.

When it comes to telling the story of Israel's retalation for the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre, the SWORD OF GIDEON is pure white knuckles suspense while MUNICH is simply banal.",1138492800,6,8354,5.109970674486804

There could hardly be a film more relevant to our times than Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" the master filmmaker's grim and controversial rumination on how violence only begets violence and how the philosophy of ""an eye for an eye,"" when taken to its extreme, only winds up with two men who cannot see.  It certainly wasn't a ""safe"" subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.

Based on the book, ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team""

by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games.  To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act.  Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission.  As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops.

Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty.  Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence.  It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism.  However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine filmmaking will have less trouble with this aspect.

For as a movie, ""Munich"" is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction.  The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time.  Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met.

As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole.  He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass.

The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching.

""Munich"" is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through.  It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes.  But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, ""Munich"" is a provocative and richly rewarding experience.",1138406400,2,3931,5.00768049155146
1542457,2,B00005JOIH,"The closing scene of the movie pitches up a 1970's New York skyline with the Twin Towers clearly visible - what does this mean?, is it saying the terrorism is inevitable and violent means to try to stop are futile?  Does it means that the methods to combating terrorism portrayed by the movie - selective assassination - were not aggressive enough?. If the focus of this movie is to get us to think about our reaction to terrorism then I believe it is not clear enough.  If it is to focus on the effects of carrying out selective assassinations on the perpetrators, then I think it is too wooden and bleeding-heart.

 As a movie there are some good points - the recreation of 1970s cityscapes is excellent - where did they get all the cool cars?  However there are significant plot flaws - who are the French guys who keeping supplying information to the Israelis about the whereabouts of the Terrorists?  Wouldn't you think the Palestinians might  become suspicious?  The French are presumably arms dealers, but the leader -`Papa' is shown as having a big family and we are treated to some stereotypical nonsense about the Papa's love of cooking and meals in the garden.  The actor who plays `Papa', did almost the same strange routine in the movie Ronin, only this time he gets to talk about cheese and truffles instead of Japanese warrior-dolls .  There is another scene where the Israeli hit team inadvertently share a safe house with a PLO team, and they talk.... Give me a break....This whole scene should have been cut.... later of course they exchange gunfire.

 There is a good acting performance from Ciaran Hinds, who plays a middle aged agent who is realistically conflicted about his role.  Eric Bana - the lead actor - also emerges well, I think.  As an actor he has an uncanny ability to emerge from dreadful movies with his reputation unshredded; he did well in the Troy movie despite its being a complete Turkey [ yes, intended].  He manages to hold our interest through the movie, despite there being up to an hour of excess dialogue.  Poor Geoffrey Rush seems to have kept the glasses from his Peter Sellers movie, he plays the Mossad controller of the hit team, but I kept expecting him to break into Dr. Strangelove voices.  Almost every Israeli general was played by someone who escaped from the home for bewildered wooden acting - one poor guy gets introduced by Geoffrey Rush's character as "" this is General so-and-so, from the army of the North"", he hugs Bana, says ""well done"", smiles and leaves. That's it, the guy manages to make it look like he's a plumber moonlightling in the movies.

 There was room here for a better story - the sets were good, the tension was evident, there was even a flicker of humour :  Bana's character was let loose in Europe with unlimited funds, but being a government operation, we see him being warned to `get receipts', as he initially  meets his French contact he is asked what he needs for his mission, his answer is `I really need receipts'.  More of this could have moved this movie along.

Speilberg is trying too hard for balance here - which is  just impossible with this topic, it would have been more realistic to give the characters white and black hats and get on with it.  By concentrating too hard on a message (which message?) the dialogue becomes wooden,  everybody - PLO, Mossad, mothers, wives, politicians, the French -  talks about homeland, justice, sacrifice ,and the spark drains from the film  A pity about this movie , it seems a sincere, but confused attempt to split the difference in a polarising topic.",1138406400,4,3592,4.667726550079491
1542458,3,B00005JOIH,"I was aware of the plot of this ambitious Steven Spielberg film.  It's based on the real drama of the assassination of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  What followed was revenge killings secretly supported by the Israeli government of the 11 known Palestinian assassins.  This aftermath is what this film is about.

And so there is international intrigue and bloodshed and lots of money being changed hands for information.  What's never clear, however, is how the informants got the information.  Lots of other important details were never clear either.  And as we are watching the bumbling of the assassinations, the compromise the assassins had to make and the possibility of some of the wrong people being murdered, the whole film played out as a discourse on the morality of it all.  This took almost three hours and I must say that I found myself glancing at my watch.

Eric Bana was cast as the team leader of the five Israelis sent on this mission.  He's a good actor and did a fine job as did most of the cast.  But with the exception of the actor cast as the bomb maker, none of them looked Jewish, leading to a loss of authenticity.  Also, as far as authenticity goes, if a film is set in an international venue, I expect the languages spoken to reflect that.  Yes, there were a few subtitles here and there, but mostly all the actors spoke English.  Some of this made me wince.  I was also surprised to see that not one scene was shot in Israel.

I understood the moral choices early on.  After that it was just scene after scene of one kind of compromise after another.

Don't get me wrong.  I think there is a time and a place and a reason to debate the consequences of violence begetting violence.  This is the stuff of Talmudic discourses.  However, I'm not sure if this film succeeded in this mission.  We saw a lot of bombs exploding, gunshot wounds, and people being hurt.  And at the end of the film we knew that the hero would never be free of fear of reprisals.

This is a worthwhile film.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  And yet it lacks so much that I hesitate to recommend it.",1138406400,2,2129,4.4366925064599485
1542519,2,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg's latest film, ""Munich"", is among the most frustrating films I've ever seen:  The frustration comes from its Schizophrenic nature - going back and forth from high competence to utter brilliance during the first two thirds, then to a rapid deterioration during the last part, ending with three quarters of an hour of the most unwatchable, torturous, movie experience in memory.

During the break (and yes, we have breaks in movies in Israel - a cynical method of selling some more Popcorn), I turned to the friend I watched this film with and told him how much I enjoyed it.  During the last quarter of an hour, we quietly debated whether we really have to sit through the experience.

'Munich' is the tale of Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), the leader of a top secret, quasi official Israeli assassination squad, sent to execute the men behind the Munich Olympic Game massacre of Israeli athletes.  The film follows Avner and his team's attempts to 'target kill' the eleven men behind the plot.

The problem as I see it, is that Spielberg creates an action film with a deep underlying reflection:  Two themes run beneath the surface: one is that violence breeds violence;  The circle of violence is not solved by killing the murderers, who will be swiftly replaced by other, equally if not more vicious killers.  The second theme is that he who commits violence is effected by it.  In Nietzsche's memorable phrase: ""if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you"".

Unlike some critics, I do not think the movie ever really equates the Terrorists and Israeli assassins.  But it does ponder about the price Civilization pays, as Golda Meir says it ""negotiates with its values"".

Whether you agree with the messages or not, the film, initially at least, does not hit you over the head with them.  From the opening scene in which American athletes unwittingly aid the Palestinian terrorists to enter the Olympic compound, the film proceeds at full speed ahead as Israel calculates it response.  In one of the most effective scenes in recent films, Golda Meir (perfectly portrayed by Lynn Cohen;  if ever a performance deserved an academy award, this is surely it) debates and decides on launching an assassination attack on the terrorists.

What follows are two hours of a thinking person's action flick.  Avner Kauffman and his squad make the acquaintance of a family of information brokers, who tips them on the whereabouts of the 11 terrorists.  The relations with the family, represented by the mysterious Papa (Michael Lonsdale) and the cool Louis (Mathieu Amalric) gets tangled when Avner and his team pass on the information to the Mossad, and participate in an Israeli raid on the terrorists' headquarters in Bayreuth (which is based upon a real raid which was led by Israel's later Prime Minister, Ehud Barak).  Papa promises to keep doing business with Avner and his group, but it seems that the Family double crosses them, harboring them in a safe house with other Palestinian terrorists and possibly selling the information on their whereabouts to their enemies.

Things seem to head to a climax when the team goes after their prime target, Munich mastermind Ali Hassan Salameh,  Salameh is saved from assassination by a group of belligerent Americans in London, apparently CIA agents (Interestingly the implication that the CIA was involved with the Black September terrorists seemed to have gone without comment among the film's reviewers.  Surely that said something about the American trust in their own government).  Then the group is targeted by a beautiful and mysterious Dutch operative (Marie-Jose Croze)...

In Nick Cave's words, ""Where do we go from here... but Nowhere?""  Throughout the film, Spielberg weaves in the aforementioned themes, in a way that is disturbing but not overwhelming:  The Group come within an eye blink of killing pre-adolescent Amina Hamshari instead of her terrorist father.  A Porter in a Cyprus hotel, who becomes unwittingly an aid in an assassination, throws away the blood money he receives.  But the weaving is subtle;  The message is in the details.

In the film's end, all subtlety is gone.  Instead, Spielberg seemingly turns to the audience and starts preaching:  ""This is important!  I have a message!  Here Comes The Message!!! Make sure you don't miss THE MESSAGE!!!"".

So we have forty five minutes or so of unwatchable film, as the action comes to a stop and Avner meditates upon the great calamity of violence.  Its slow, emotionally manipulative (alas ineffectively so), condescending, and utterly dull.  Spielberg is on the soapbox and he won't let go.

As I've said, there is much to like about this film.  The action scenes are gripping, and the acting is simply superb (It is a rare film indeed where an actor as good as Eric Bana - who was virtually the only redeeming virtue in the otherwise unwatchable TROY - is overshadowed by the other case members, particularly Lynn Cohen as Prime Minister Meir, Lonsdale and Amalric as Papa and Louis, and Geoffrey Rush as Avner's operator, Ephraim). Throughout much of the film, Spielberg does his usual magic.

But all is overshadowed by the dreadfully dull Coda.  It is so bad it really erases all the good will the film's previous 2 hours has generated.  And so as much as I loved parts of it, I cannot recommend Munich to anyone.",1138406400,8,5374,4.931034482758621
1542520,1,B00005JOIH,"I can see why Mossad broke cover and took part in two post-Munich documentaries, the second of which I watched the night before seeing 'Munich'. Professional pride was at stake after the angst ridden, Keystone Cops portrayal given here. Not saying Mossad's rebuttal should be taken as gospel and Spielberg 'trusts his sources' apparently. However, I'm not convinced by his film.

In the documentary, the elevator assassins ask their target for his name and shoot him quickly using silencers. In 'Munich', they come across as bumbling amateurs. Another agent shows up after they've departed to look for shell casings, inexplicably exposing himself to possible arrest through his enigmatically slow lingering. But hey, doesn't enigmatically slow lingering look cinematic? The team doesn't hire an explosives expert, that would be too vulgar a display of professional competence. They take his word for it instead. No checking of backgrounds in Mossad it appears. This elite team will foolishly run back into a building to salvage a botched job rather than walk away. Curiously, the writer chooses to ignores facts about the Beruit raid concerning the loss of the element of surprise. Instead, he prefers to make up no end of far fetched mistakes.

'Munich' smacks of a writer constantly puting his own sentiments into the mouths of people least likely to have expressed such reservations. The most a real life Mossad assassin would admit to in the documentary is deliberatly avoiding sentimentality by not seeing his gun-downed target as a family man. Instead, he concentrated on his orders and trusted his bosses judgement implicitly. In a scene of stunning crassness in 'Munich', the paranoid lead agent strips his room looking for Israeli type assassination tactics and then goes to hide in his closet just as he had been told his enemy had been driven to. But why does he think tactics unique to Israeli intelligence would be used against him? Do I smell agenda? But to make sure we really get it, team Spielberg has the agent look like an x-ray during debriefing back in Israel. He's a ghost, get it. Haunting himself because of what the state has made him do. No wonder the real life Israeli intelligence community is feeling more than a little miffed.

The Americans don't come out of the picture smelling of roses either, surprise, surprise. In the documentary I saw, the CIA opperative who handled a key PLO leader Mossad wanted to assassinate over Munich at least expressed sentiments sympathetic to the Israeli position. In the film, the CIA are portrayed as positely anti-Semitic, giving the Mossad team the proverbial one fingered salute.

I noticed that the writer had the Munich atheletes fight back against the terrorists, one even bravely climbing back into the window to tackle the bad guys single handedly with a knife versus assault rifles. Wishful thinking as an answer to events in World War Two? Or is the writer suggesting that the individual is entitled to fight back, but state sponsored assassination is a no-no? The message I took from the final scene was that Israel is a false construct that will turn Jew against Jew, a scurrilous piece of anti-Zionist muck raking that no doubt will find its constituency.

Why not keep to the facts? The real life botched killing of an innocent man that ended with the incarceration of a Mossad hit squad should have said plenty about the evils of violating international law. Instead we are offered indigestible hand ringing platitudes unconvincingly delivered by all and sundry.

Technically, I wish Spielberg would dump this cinematographer he seems to be using of late. Gloomy bluey grey washed out vistas with ghosting, especially against light sources. Enough.

Sorry, Steve. I went to bat for you over War of the Worlds, but I can't defend this clunker. Even Oliver Stone might blanche at this revionist claptrap.",1138320000,24,3884,5.031104199066874
1542521,5,B00005JOIH,"Munich was one of 2005's best movies because it's ultimate message, for those who actually pay attention, was one of understanding.

Munich is not anti-Semitic or anti-Islamic it is only anti-stupidity.  The repetitive and non-productive cycle of revenge that is present in all of society is the enemy that Speilberg sought to expose.

Acknowledgement is made that both the Islamic extremists who perpetrated the terrorist plot at the Munich games and the Israeli assassin squad ordered to kill them are all products of the environment that reared them.

This movie is often hard to watch and it spotlights the idiocy of issues like blind patriotism, murder, and religious zeal, when those issues are not counterbalanced with reason and intelligence.

While I think Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are both better movies I believe Spielberg took greater risk by investing a heckuva lot of his personal beliefs into this film.  Obviously controversy would emerge with any film dealing with this subject matter, the fact that no sides are overtly taken is a true testament to Speilberg's genius.

The only advocacy clearly nurtured in this film is for a worldwide push for peace, to set aside the differences that are more traditional than tangible, for nations to adhere to reason in diplomacy, rather than naked emotion.

If you really want to know what Munich is ultimately about you'll have to wait until the very last shot in the film.  In the background there are two buildings that are no longer there.

This should have been wonderful: a great historical story and a master director and his usual crew to tell it. Apart from making achingly obvious points about the pointlessness of tit-for-tat retaliation between Israelis and Palestinians, the screenplay helpfully eschews most of the politics and instead makes this a human story: it's an exploration of the immense personal cost of the politics of revenge for those ordered to exact it. At least, it tries to be that. As the story of a man who comes to question the morality of politically-justified murder, it should have been incredibly moving. As it turns out, it's incredibly dull. It's too long, too sprawling, too unfocused. It felt like a rough cut with 45 minutes still to come out. The all-important interpersonal scenes are badly written, and only one or two of the action sequences are up to Spielberg's standard. Janusz Kaminski's usually wonderful cinematography aims for realism but verges on ugly and banal. John Williams' music is, for the first time ever, utterly forgettable. Also, for once in their collective career, Spielberg and Michael Kahn have made a complete mess of the editing. Lapses in continuity abound. Intercutting the events from Munich with the story-proper probably looked good on paper, but in the viewing it feels discontinuous, pointless and even a little gratuitous - never more so than when the violent climax of the terrorist raid is intercut with a sex scene, presumably as a way of showing the psychological impact of the events on Avner's relationship with his wife. Pity he never witnessed them. The horrific nature of what happened might have been more usefully deployed at the start of the film as a way of encouraging the audience to share the Israelis' outrage. The casting didn't work for me - Geoffrey Rush, especially. What is it with Oscar-winners and bit parts? Does Spielberg really need a marquee name other than his own to open a movie? Is there no Jewish actor who could've more capably played Ephraim? I found Bana quite empathetic but only intermittently convincing. Perhaps it's my inability, as an Australian, finally to divorce Eric Bana the aspiring A-list Hollywood actor from Eric Bana the A-list local stand-up comic. Or perhaps it's just that he was a little better at the latter: as a movie star, he occasionally suffers from the same kind of woodenness that afflicts Spielberg's favourite leading man, Harrison Ford. But I guess there are worse comparisons. I wanted to like this film, but ultimately found it incredibly disappointing. The inner battle between the emotional impulse for violent justice and the rational desire to break the cycle of violence is the crux of the film, but it simply doesn't sustain intellectual interest on that level. The issue is explored in a far too obvious and superficial manner for it ever to really work.",1138233600,2,3107,5.023255813953488

During the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, eleven Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September. In retaliation, the Israeli government recruits a group of Mossad agents to track down and execute those responsible for the attack.

  Anytime I hear that Steven Spielberg is directing a film I immediately take notice and become interested. I am a big fan of true events being brought to the screen and this film certainly did not disappoint. I had always known of the massacre that occurred in Munich during the 1972 Olympic games but never knew in great detail what actually occurred. So I went into this film expecting a great film and at the same time hoping to be educated in this horrific event.

  Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the group of agents that are attempting to bring justice to what occurred at the Olympic games. I had never been a huge fan of Eric Bana, he was commendable in the film Troy but Hulk was a miserable film to say the least. However I do not necessarily blame him for Hulk, I tend to start disliking the people that are associated with crap films. Regardless, Bana redeemed himself in Munich.

  This film does not pull any punches, it is a very gritty and emotional look into what took place and it does an excellent job of immersing the audience into a world of revenge and loyalty to ones country. At times this film will have you on the edge your seat as you watch the agents set up and pull off assassinations then immediately throw you into a emotional roller coaster as you watch the mass murders ensue and the paranoia that plaques the agents as they try to fulfill their duty to their homeland. Real footage of the Munich tragedy is at times seamlessly blended into the movie and the cinematography is stunning to say the least. One worthy mention is Ayelet Zorer who plays Daphna the wife of Bana, she does not have a huge part in the movie but she excels in her role and I hope to see more of her in the future. Munich definitely has the Spielberg touch and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

""Munich"" is about the cycle of revenge and response caused by the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. It's a compelling movie, as unpleasant and uncomfortable as is the subject.

Spielberg portrays an Israeli hit squad that gradually loses its moral certainty as assassination piles on assassination. A key moment in the film is when when a young, idealistic Palestinian terrorist talks of the need of a homeland -- much as Israelis talk -- and the dawning realization on the assassin's leader, Eric Bana, that not much in the way of moral space separates the terrorists from the hit squad.

Unlike others, I did not care for the omnipresent ""French connection"" in the movie. One is asked to believe that an old man on a farm seemingly has all the information in the world at hand, including the addresses and bios of Palestinian terrorists. This was a cheap plot trick in my opinion, a quick and easy, but hardly credible way for the hit squad to find terrorists. Better would have been a gritty search, blind alleys, and a mistake or two along the way.

The obvious message of the movie is that violence begets violence and a better way must be found. Spielberg doesn't suggest that better way. I won't bore the reader with my solution, but attempts to look at the Palestinian/Israeli problem in a even-handed manner is a good trend.

1542525,4,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg is no stranger to delicate political topics, and herein makes no exception with a fairly graphic, factually based chronology of the Black September aftermath at the 1972 Munich Olympics of the title, the five men chosen to eliminate the ones responsible, and the fallout and retribution on both sides, engendered thereafter.

Eric Bana plays Avner, an expectant father and low key Mossad enlisted soldier, but son of a hero, who is as horrified and outraged at the events of Munich as the rest of his family and countrymen. He is called to undertake a special ""task"" outlined by prime minister Golda Meir and her cabinet, in the wake of the killings to ""let the World know"" the consequence of the Palestinians actions, by setting off to Europe with a list of assassination targets. I won't go into too much further detail, as I don't wish to spoil the movie. I actually have vague memories of the Israeli Hostage debacle at Munich myself, and went on to study the (then termed) Arab/Israeli Conflict in more detail several years later. As an impartial, it is perhaps easier to see through the passionate elements of the story, and draw conclusions on a wider, human level, and it is here that the power of the story lies. Regardless of your political, or religious affiliations, the story is much deeper than the apparent two sides on display, and yet becomes paradoxically more basic in its message (at least in my humble opinion as to the message Spielberg seems to be trying to get across). This is not about ""highly trained"" assassins paying dues, but rather, well intended, deeply motivated and passionate men following orders for what they think is right, and juggling with their own morality later. The question it seems is an age old one, ""does the end justifying the means"" and as the story deepens and unfolds, the main characters all begin to battle with moral demons, and paranoid soul searching. There is a wealth of talent on display here, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds (HBO Rome's Caesar), Daniel Craig (the new 007 by the way) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Jakob the Liar) and several others, who glean the benefits of a tight script and masterful direction by Spielberg throughout. There are some terrific moments of high tension, some very graphic violence, and also unfortunately, some stale plodding periods along the way. I marveled at the attention to detail in re creating 1973, from the models of European cars, and clothing, to even correct movie posters outside theatres, appearing in no more than a walk across scene. On the down side, this movie is a tad on the long side at 2hrs and 44 mins, and could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes. Others have suggested that more could have been done with the material, although I thought it was well handled (with the exception of juxtaposing a sex scene with hostage murders). It is certainly well deserving of the `R' rating, and doesn't (in the usual Spielberg fashion) shy away from the grittiest of details, especially in the bombing and murder scenes. On the whole I rated it 4 Stars, which is probably a little generous, but the polished feel to the whole picture, and excellent acting all round is well worthy of merit. An Oscar contender? I doubt it, and it's hardly Stevens's best work to date, but it IS well worth seeing. Enjoy",1137888000,,3328,4.787826086956522

Though this is a lot more preferrable than most of the other junk being produced today, it does have its share of objectionable content.  I would not recommend this to young children because the film faithfully depicts the violence and horror of the Palestinian terrorism in Europe.  The explosions rocked me out of my seat, and the unnecessary nude scenes I can do without.

Nevertheless, this faithfully tells the horror of the tyranny and at the end it speaks of how the terror group dictator was captured years later.  My best recommendation for the subject would be a documentary on the History Channel.

1542527,3,B00005JOIH,"Spielberg's film ""Munich"" is a remake of the 1986 film ""Sword of Gideon"" starring Michael York and Rod Steiger.  The true story of the terrorist incident at the 1972 Olympics and the Israeli response.  This film is grittier and more graphic than the original, though many scenes are taken verbatim from it.

  One problem I have is the title.  Kind of like ""JFK"" which wasn't really about JFK, ""Munich"" isn't about Munich.  It does recreate the original incident, but better to see the 1999 documentary ""One Day in September"".  The final scene with the World Trade Center photoshopped into the scene was effective, but the point that was to be made was too nebulus.  What is it exactly Spielberg is trying to say there?

  Again if you see ""Sword of Gideon"" much of ""Munich"" is redundant, and in a sense a rip-off, especially as it isn't being marketed as a remake, trying to sweep that under the rug.  The good points are the realism of the camerawork.  I think Spielberg reaches too far by taken incidents and trying to extend them into universal themes.  Schindler's list was not the quintessential Holocaust film as some believe, it was a specific story (War and Remembrance would be the quintessential one).  And likewise this is so far from a quintessential film on terrorism, but it wants to be.",1137628800,6,1302,4.72
1542599,5,B00005JOIH,"MOVIE: Steven Spielberg's gritty and emotional drama is in my opinion the best film of 2005. I don't remember the last time a film grabbed me and wouldn't let go like Munich did. Eric Bana plays Avner, who is hand picked by the Israeli government to track down and kill the Palestinian leaders of the terrorist group who organized the 1972 Munich hostage killings of eleven Israeli olympic athletes. Avner is a family man, he loves his wife and cannot wait for her to give birth to their baby daughter. He is then taken away from his family to fulfill this mission. He is the head of a group of five men, all with different specialties, and they must one by one track down and kill the Palestinian terrorist leaders. The film is a deep dark look into the nature of man, and you will be deeply moved by the actions taken and the journey that Avner completes. Spielberg gives the audience a lot to chew on, there are many different viewpoints expressed, but it's not solely a political film. Avner is a real character that people can identify with. His moral descisions and actions all paint his character for the audience to connect with. Geoffrey Rush turns in another brilliant performance as the man who secretly employs these men, and he represents the government's viewpoint in the film. All he wants is for revenge to be had. Avner enters this game with a similar viewpoint, he wants justice to be had for these brutal executions, but his character grows throughout the film and he comes to realize that violence as a tool is futile in the war to stop violence. We see two opposites in character with Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush, two people who will never see anything in the same light, and this gives way for the brilliant ending to the film. The film itself is made as if Spielberg spent months and months planning it, however they started filming in July of 2005 and had a December 23rd release date. That is simply amazing that a team of filmmakers were able to make a film this good in that amount of time. The scene structure is absolutely amazing. Spielberg will build tension within the scene by using a continuing shot and will not cut away. The camera tracking is unbelievable. Instead of having three or four cameras for one scene, he will use one. The camera will dolly, zoom, pan, and tilt to show the scene, but never cut away. The camera style is almost Hitchcockian, and it works to perfection. Every assassination that is carried out is intensly thrilling, and you will be coiled up in your seat for the entire film. It is gripping, emotional, intelligent, and raises enough questions for the audience to ponder. This is a master filmmaker at his best, the film is visually breathtaking and emotionally stunning.

ACTING: Who knew Eric Bana would hold a leading role in a film like this, and pull it off with perfection? I don't see how he cannot get a nomination for this role, he was simply captivating. He handled this huge role and made it seem real, you feel every emotion that Avner is going through and that really helps the film's overall impact on the audience. The rest of the cast turn in great ensamble performances, and Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as always. The cast is perfect, no possible way it could have been better.

BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg knows exactly what's needed to create the perfect tone, and he can switch from heartwarming to disturbing in a blink of an eye and make it seamless. This film is gritty, violent, emotional, and will make you ask serious questions about the state of global conflict and the nature of man. This 2 hour 45 minute film will seem like an hour because there is not one dry spot in the entire movie, the audience is involved from the very opening to the closing credits. The film doesn't feel like a history lesson, it is an intense thriller made masterfully by Spielberg. It will stay in your mind long after you see it.",1137542400,3,3896,4.572246065808297
1542600,5,B00005JOIH,"...at least, that's the premise of Spielberg's latest film, Munich.

I went with with a friend to see the movie yesterday afternoon, in Palo Alto.

The film opens with the terrorist attack upon the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. Palestinean terrorists seize a number of Israeli athletes, some of whom are killed in the initial attack, others who are killed at the airport at the attempted getaway.

It's the aftermath that the movie portrays. Israeli leadership calls itself to action, and sends an off-the-books assassination squad after those responsible for the attack. Their activities are restricted to terrorists located in Europe.

  Ephraim: We have 11 Palestinian names, each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead.

Eric Bana plays the leader of the squad (Avner). He and his team proceed down the path of righteous retribution, with the best of intentions. But, they question their way down the path more and more as time goes along.

  Carl: It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin.

  Avner: Think of yourself as something else then.

The men are to only hit the men responsible for the attacks, and avoid collateral damage, and they take this seriously, panicking when children or newlyweds stumble into the line of fire. They can also sense that, mostly off-screen, the terrorist organization they hunt is retaliating.

In the end, when their hunt is called off, Bana finds himself a changed man. A family man, even more important to him than being an Israeli, he comes home to his wife and child, and cannot shake the sense of paranoia that has become a part of him, due to the task he'd had, and he questions the success his handlers tell him he's achieved. Terrorism has continued, actually gotten worse, with new leaders springing up in place of the fallen.

It's an ambivalent ending...no answers are given. Why should there be? We, out here in the real world clearly don't have them.

It's a well-executed film. Spielberg's brought his A-game to this project. In many ways, the film feels minimalist, but that's because of the squad's single-minded purpose. The film was shot on location in Paris (near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge), Hungary, Malta, and New York City, with a good effort put into making the scenery have the feel of the mid-1970s. The cast is superb, with Eric Bana leading the way. The violence is graphic, brutal, and believable.

It's a film designed to make you think. I'd recommend y'all go see it, and think about it.",1137283200,,2488,4.827830188679245

1542603,5,B00005JOIH,"Coming off the huge-budget success of his remake of War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg is back with another of his ""issue"" movies in Munich, and the result is not only one of his best movies yet but easily one of the best of the decade so far.  Concerning the Israeli response to the infamous terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli competitors, Munich largely follows the Israeli contingent charged with killing the Black September planners behind the assault.  Obviously it has extra significance in the here and now, when fears of terrorism are so rampant, but Munich makes for a great watch anyway simply because it's so effective in its portrayal of the forces that drive people to devote so much time, energy, and resources to kill each other when they could be engaged in more constructive activities.  The technical abilities of Spielberg and his sidemen are of course on full display, but more than Spielberg's other serious movies (Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, most notably), the chief source of Munich's success lies in its nuanced portrayal of such complicated and touchy subject matter.

Easily manipulated automatons, er, I mean patriots of any stripe may not find Munich to their liking, but it contains more than enough subtle shadings and moral ambiguity to please thinking viewers.  With ample room to operate given its considerable running time, Munich eventually develops into three movies: a taut political thriller, a complex examination of vengeance, and a harrowing look into the recesses of one man's mind.  Its blunt depictions of violence, emotional intensity, and frequent gallows humor may be unpleasant, but much like in The Pianist, discomfort is the name of the game here.  And much as the Pianist's tale of simple, brute survival could be applied to situations other than the Holocaust, Munich's (admittedly somewhat fictionalized) revenge story has a resonance well beyond the Middle East, which I'm sure is what Spielberg intended.

Although it's told almost entirely from a Jewish point of view, the brilliance of Munich lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't ask the viewer to take sides (in spite of some of the rather shallow criticisms I've seen on this site and elsewhere), but instead examines the endless cycle of retaliation in a way that makes each side's case look both equally sensible and equally insane.  While it's mercifully short on long-winded oratory, the dialogue still frequently touches on the fact that each side thinks its claim to Israel is perfectly legitimate, and that there's plenty of guilt in the conflict to around.  Spielberg doesn't attempt to cover up the brutality of the Palestinian assualt in Munich, but as one member of the Israeli hit team notes, Arabs weren't the inventors of bloodshed.  Granted, we only hear second-hand about the Israeli government's less-than-warm-and-fuzzy treatment of its Palestinian population, but there's enough discussion of it to pierce any veneer of righteousness in Isreal's actions. Violence against civilians is a double-edged sword, the movie seems to be saying, one that people only notice when their own are the victims.

Since the story is mostly told through the eyes of one man, it's a good thing Eric Bana is so chillingly convincing as Avner, a low-level Mossad agent and quiet family man given the task of leading the Israeli hit team.  Despite his lack of experience, Avner actually makes the perfect man for his job, as the nature of his work may give him pause, but in the end he compartmentalizes, accepts the justifications he's given, and kills whom he's told to kill.  As the movie makes clear, it's essential to any war or war-type conflict that we get by the fact that our enemies are every bit as human as we are, much as we might like to pretend otherwise.  Avner isn't one to stop and think carefully about what he's doing (at least until he's done, anyway), so it takes on added weight at the end of the movie when he does finally realize how little he's accomplished.

Unfortunately, as we all know by now, this story doesn't have a happy ending, and the events of the past thirty years weigh heavily on Munich.  Of course, if everyone had made up back in the '70's, the subject matter wouldn't seem quite as important.  In the end, this movie supports a conclusion I reached a while back: the world would be a much better place if humankind declared a mulligan on all of history up till now, admitted every group has done some naughty things, and started over.  Of course, since the odds of that happening are about the same as the chances of the Red Sox winning the next Super Bowl, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.",1137196800,3,4715,4.885964912280702
1542604,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg has often been the focus of a lot of criticism throughout a career of blockbusters and Oscar-winning films like SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but I don't think the criticism has been as intense towards him as it has been to MUNICH.  Here he is, taking on the subjects of terrorism and vengeance--and there are all these people, condemning him not only for doing it, but for the very way he's doing it.  Why is this?

Well, for one thing, he takes as his starting point the murder of eleven Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich on September 5, 1972, and how Israel responded to it.  The Israeli agents, led by a devout Jew (Eric Bana), are assigned to go after the eleven Palestinian masterminds behind the Munich massacre and kill them.  But the more these agents kill, the more they realize that their actions are not only leading to more bloodshed, they themselves are not just the hunters but also, in many respects, the hunted.  For every terrorist, whether actual or supposed, that they assassinate, one more pops up somewhere around the world.

This last point is the point that Spielberg is the most intent on making clear--vengeance is only so good up to a point, and then one must ask, at what price?  It is the kind of ambiguity that is rife in the real world, and a lot of people with very fanatical views don't want to be confronted with that kind of reality, and particularly not in America after the 9/11 attacks.  Contrary to what its detractors would say, Spielberg never condemns Israel for its post-Munich actions--NOT ONCE.  But he is asking some straightforward questions about what the costs are for mere vengeance, not only in human lives, but also, and most especially, in human souls, be they Jewish or Arab.  The film's final shot, across the Hudson River to the twin towers of the World Trade Center is Spielberg's way of saying that now the issue of the cost of vengeance applies to his own country as well.

Although a very long film at close to two hours and 45 minutes, MUNICH still moves with lightning precision, tension, and documentary-like camerawork, utilizing television footage from the actual events at Munich, and describing how the operations of Bana's team are often carried out on the fly and with always bloody, and sometimes imperfect results.  This is definitely NOT the kind of us-versus-them film that the American far-right likes, but it's the way the real world often works, and it's the way Spielberg sees it.  All of his skills as a director are put to the fullest possible use to make MUNICH yet another feather in his cap as Hollywood's premiere prestige filmmaker.",1137110400,8,2689,4.754838709677419
1542605,4,B00005JOIH,"After the shrill disappointment of his ""War of the Worlds"", Steven Spielberg has returned to terra firma with a melodrama ""based on real events"", the retaliation for murders of Israeli atheletes at the 1972 Olympics. ""Munich"" has become a hotbed of controversy since its depiction of Jewish assassins, their coldness and their greed, could easily be construed as anti-Semitic. Of course, Spielberg himself is a Jew, as is his primary scenarist Tony Kushner. So it does seem odd that the leader of the commandoes can prepare and eat rich, heavy meals after killing someone in cold blood. (The leader has been recruited from Mossad, but he has been obliged to resign from that organization and works with no political recognition.) Further, his victims (the men who masterminded the Olympic massacre) are presented in the most attractive light possible. Their first victim is a gentle translator of ""The Thousand and One Nights"", and the second is a loving husband and father. (An almost Hitchcockian touch: after the latter's telephone is rigged with a remote-control explosive, it's his young daughter who answers the signal.) When one of the assassins congratulates the leader on becoming a new father -- Mazel tov! -- he adds that one of the victims has finally succumbed to his wounds. ""And so,"" he says ""mazel tov again."" They get their assigment locations from an apolitical French informer whose price depends on the importance of the target. (""I want receipts!"" their Mossad boss yells.) It all makes Israel seem very frosty and forbidding, which is why Spielberg has been accused by critics of working with a guilt complex; but I think had he made his patriot a clear-eyed hero with no doubts and no regrets Spielberg would have been accused by those same critics of chauvanism. (There are artistic critiques and then there are personal attacks.) As it is, the character Avner becomes increasingly paranoid, so that his life becomes nightmarish. Eric Bana is impressive as Avner; his staunch Hector was the only really interesting thing about ""Troy"". Spielberg occasionally falls into Hollywood clichs: when Avner returns to his wife and child in Brooklyn he's so entranced he walks into traffic, not very likely for someone trained in intelligence. And about two-thirds into the story there's a Mata Hari sequence that might have dropped out of another movie. But for the most part Spielberg, influenced perhaps by Costa-Gravas, has created a tense political thriller, strengthened by the photography of Janusz Kaminski, grainy and filled with muted colors. (One suspects that Spielberg was tempted to film in black and white.) Spielberg's style here is exclusively cerebral (I notice that Colin Wilson is now one of his producers), and there is almost no humor in ""Munich"". A grim study of endless retaliation, the film seems to say we are all murderers and deserve our place in Gehenna.",1137110400,6,2897,5.088235294117647
1542606,3,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg is foremost a great storyteller. More to the point, a great visual storyteller. I doubt he was preoccupied with politics when he shot Artificial Intelligence. I doubt he worried about offending one side or the other is Schindler's List. Watching Munich, I got the sense that Mr. Spielberg strived to offend neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis(a noble goal . . . why offend anybody?), but while succeeding in this goal, he failed in another area . . . to tell a convincing narrative. Yes, the metaphorical scene involving the Arab and Jewish `hit teams' slumbering in the same safe house achieved a political goal(ie. We are all homo sapiens and we're all in this together on the big blue marble), but did it advance the story? This brings up a larger flaw in this movie; was the editor drunk? I've never seen so many superfluous scenes in a movie. I got the sense if you could have cut out like 50 minutes of film . . . this might have been a very good film. Much has been written on the politics of Munich vis--vis Spielberg. Perhaps the same questions should be asked of the screenwriters as well. For full disclosure, I don't see the moral equivalency between killing Jewish Athletes and Palestinian terrorists. However, the brilliant One Day In September does suggest this very argument. This brilliant documentary of the events of Munich show the lives of the Israeli athletes as well as the sojourn of the Palestinian terrorists . . . not just their actions but what motivated them(successfully showing their human dimension). One Day In September shows you can have a political axe to grind, but the story can still be brilliant. Before  you make your political arguments, your moral view of how people should live, your thematic and societal revelations, you have to tell a good story, and this is precisely where Mr. Spielberg does not measure up compared to his previous work.

- ""Papa"" lets Avril know that he is no rolling stone in ""Munich""

Steven Spielberg's latest is one of his best dramatic films with only ""Schindler's List"" & ""Saving Private Ryan"" out distancing it.

On September 5, 1972, the XXth Olympiad being held in Munich, West Germany, was interupted by the Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September, taking Israeli Olympians hostage that would result in a hauntingly historic & horrorific tragic outcome.

ABC Sportscaster, Jim McKays' words still chill the bone to this day.

""I've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my father used to say that are greatest hopes & worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears were realized tonight. They have said that there were 11 hostages. 2 killed in their rooms this mor- yesterday morning. 9 killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone.""

With this tragic & senseless loss, the country of Isreal secretly retaliates with Prime Minister, Golda Meare recruiting a young field operative who Meare has known in the past, named Avril, to put together a five man operation consisting of ex-Mousad soldiers to avenge the deaths of the fallen atheletes of Munich & killing the 11 conspirators that were responsible for their deaths.

Avril accepts the mission with unflinching trust in his country & patriotic pride. Working undercover (he signs a contract stating that he doesn't exist), & with the help of his secret ops. commander, Ephraim, Avril is given bank accounts with unlimited financial resources to recruit the best agents for the job & do whatever it takes to get the job done. Traveling to & around Europe, the group slowly starts to gain notice with each death, in the dark confines of the underworld. Avril's underground contact, Louis, is a perfect piece of 70's Euro-trash (even his father, known only as ""Papa"" would gladly trade him for Avril) & slowly becomes untrustworthy. Soon, the hunters become the hunted. When he slowly starts to lose members of his team, Avril starts to get paranoid, checking his hotel phone, his bed, & his T.V. for explosive devices. Adding to the stress is his family, who he misses dearly.

When he does finally return home, he slowly realizes that the country he once believed in, never truly believed in him. Feeling used & betrayed, Avril returns to his family, but, still living the feeling of being trapped in the paranoid crosshairs of terrorism.

""Munich"" is one of the best films of 2005. Spielberg's direction is top notch (he just may get another Oscar for this). The flashback scenes are a bit gruesome, but, factually acurate.

Using the ABC footage of the Olympics and incorporating into the filmed footage gave ""Munich"" a very spooky edge. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is very much in the style of  70's cinematography (this may get a well deserved Oscar, also).

The cast is great. Eric Bana as Avril is his best role to date. Daniel Craig & Geoffrey Rush with the rest of the cast help elevate the film's greatness. I would expect Oscar nods for Bana for best actor & supporting role nods for Rush & Craig.

Since I'm a die-hard fan of Spielberg's work I couldn't help, but, notice one drawback.

The origin of ""Indiana Jones"" is legendary. In the late 70's Spielberg & George Lucas were discussing future film projects. Spielberg told Lucas he had always wanted to direct a Bond movie, but, Lucas led Spielberg down a different path with ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". 24 years after the release of ""Raiders"", & as I watching ""Munich"" it finally hit me, Spielberg finally got to make his spy movie.

Don't believe me?

""Munich"" has a small group of secret agents sent out to avenge the deaths of the Isreali Olympiads. The 1989 Bond film, ""License To Kill"" has 007 getting his license to kill revoked as he avenges the attemted death of a close friend.

Daniel Craig who is one of the secret ops working for Bana in ""Munich"" is the new James Bond in the upcoming ""Casino Royale"".

Michael Lonsdale who portrays the dangerous ""Papa"" in ""Munich"" also portrayed the even more villanous Hugo Drax in the 1979 Bond film ""Moonraker"".

A lot of the different locales were a bit reminiscent of locales from all sorts of spy movies of the past. ""Munich"" has a scene where Avril meets Louis, in France, to talk about business in a market with the Eiffel Tower looming in the background. In the 1985 Bond film ""A View To A Kill"", Bond meets his contact in a restaurant atop the Eifell Tower.

So, did Mr. Spielberg direct a dramatic film based on true events?

Or, did he direct a dramatic film that happened to be a spy film with a twist (a Jewish James Bond?).

Only Steven Spielberg knows for sure.

I also highly, highly recommend the 1999 documentary ""One Day In September"" narrated by Michael Douglas. This Oscar winner is an extremely powerful look at 9/5/72, that chronicals the entire day from start to finish with a look at what would become ""Munich"".

The setting is Munich, 1972 in the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes.  But the topic is as timely as yesterday's news: How do free societies respond to terrorist attacks without regressing to the type of values and tactics they are supposedly fighting against.

The film begins with a graphic re-creation of the kidnapping of the Israeli athletes.  The scenes of the athletes' initial struggle against their captors are gripping.  And archival TV news reports are intertwined in the action to make it all seem very realistic.  When it's over, we feel the horror and outrage that Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir must have felt that day.  So when she reluctantly approves a secret mission to hunt down and kill those who had a hand in planning the terrorist attack, we understand.

The movie follows the team of Israeli agents brought together for this task as they go about the business of finding and killing the people whose names they've been given.  At first, they are driven by a strong sense of righteousness, and they equate their acts of vengeance with justice.  But with each successful assassination, we see the Israelis grow more uncomfortable with their actions as they begin to question their assignment.

Spielberg has taken great pains to humanize the Israeli agents.  They are portrayed not as the cold-blooded, efficient killers we might expect from Israel's elite Mossad, but rather a rag-tag collection of what seem like ordinary men conscripted into their nation's service.  Killing does not come easily to them, and their initial actions seem tentative and sometimes humorously amateurish.  In this way, viewers will relate to them as they struggle with the moral dimensions of their assignment and the consequences of their actions.

In true Hitchkock-like style, the killings are not easy.  Fate often intervenes with the assassination plans, causing difficulty for the agents and suspense for the audience.  To make matters more unsettling, the Palestinian targets are also humanized, and, one could claim,  sentimentalized.  When we first meet target #1, we see a kindly old man reading poetry.  When the Israelis catch up to him, he has just purchased some milk and exchanged pleasantries with the store owner.  Killing him seems so far removed from the horrors of Munich, and so unnecessary.  Other targets seem similarly unworthy of the fate in store for them.

In short, Munich is not a Charles Bronson film.  While it is entertaining in its action and suspense, we feel no satisfaction in the vengeance and neither do most of the Israelis in the film.  Spielberg wants us to feel the seeming futility and emptiness of the retribution, just as the Israeli's do.  And yet, their actions remain necessary.  For those who are tempted to conclude that violence is not the answer, as some of the younger Israelis in the film start to believe, there are older Israelis to remind them- and us- that Israel's creation and continued existence relies on their willingness to fight for it, and against an enemy that has no hesitation about using violence.

Some have criticized Munich for portraying a moral equivalence between Israeli and Palestinian violence.  I don't think this is so.  In fact, the film is about the interaction between three distinct moral approaches to violence.  The first, represented by the Palestinian terrorists, sees violence as a strategy toward an end.  For them, the more heinous and barbaric the act, the more likely they believe it will help them achieve their goal.  The Israelis, on the other hand, represent Judeo-Christian values of respecting life and avoiding harm to innocents.  In fact, the film shows us how the Israeli agents go to great lengths to avoid killing anyone not on their list.  One of the agents complains about the futility of this, since for every person they have carefully targeted and killed, the Palestinians respond by wantonly killing dozens more.  And there is a third approach, the mercenary, represented in the film by various European characters, mostly a strange family of French informants, who seem to care little about who is killing whom or why, as long as they can profit from it.

Munich succeeds in unsettling us and making us think, but in the end, the film reflects what we already know: that there are no easy answers.  That the things we hold dear must sometimes be fought for and defended against, but that in our actions, we must take care that we neither lose to the enemy nor lose ourselves.",1136937600,3,4703,4.965473145780051
1542678,5,B00005JOIH,"At the 1972 Olympics in Munich, the terrorist group Black September kidnapped and murdered some Israeli atheletes.  This is the story of Isreal's response to this horrific event.  Avner (Bana) is chosen to lead a five-man team of ex-Mossad agents that are to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians responsible for the attack.  They are working unofficially for the government, through their handler, Ephraim (Rush), who provides them money and information.  For Avner, this is patriotism, and a chance to serve his country.

The team travels the world locating and eliminating their targets.  He becomes focused and begins to lose himself with each passing murder.  Also, the hunters become the hunted, and soon they are guarding their own lives as well as trying to finish the job.  Plus, Black September begins retaliating, forcing Avner to question their actions and if those actions are actually making things better or worse.

""Munich"" is an excellent movie, showing a story that is very relevant today.  It is thought provoking and engaging.  Eric Bana is amazing as the conscience-tortured Avner who just wants to do the right thing.  His team (especially the new James Bond, Daniel Craig) are all excellent in their roles.  The story is fast paced, and full of action.  Director Stephen Speilberg has crafted another masterpiece.  ""Munich"" is an important film that I highly recommend be seen by all.",1136851200,2,1416,5.122270742358078
1542679,5,B00005JOIH,"This was a really good , movie, not one of my favorite Speilbergs by any means though. It was very intense at times, nothing too emotional to me. Just pretty suspensful. Great suspense that is. Very well filmed movie, I was actually expecting more about the Olympics and all, but it was about assassins going after those responsible for the killings in Munich. The acting was very good and deserves some nods, but I don't see it winning best picture or anything, and Speilberg probably won't snag his next oscar for director. Worth a look and to be remembered. The action was very intense, some of the best scenes I've seen in a while. Scary what goes on in other countries back then, and now of course.",1136851200,,703,4.543307086614173
1542680,5,B00005JOIH,"Just shy of three hours, Munich is an excellent film that is causing a lot of controversy among Jewish groups in the US and Israel, and among Palestinians. By upsetting both groups, director Steven Spielberg has found elusive middle ground that saves the film from being Oliver Stone-preachy while weaving tension and moral ambiguity, from beginning to end.

This is the second film based on the 1984 book Vengeance:The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team by Canadian journalist George Jonas, the first being the 1985 HBO made-for-television movie, Sword of Gideon.

Mossad agent and ex-bodyguard for Prime Minister Golda Meier, Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana), is asked to head a secret unofficial team on a very dangerous mission that would take him away from his pregnant wife for many months, if not years. He is assigned four other men, most of whom are seemingly unlikely members of an elite hit squad. The only other athletic person is Steve, aggressive and feisty, played by a crackling, magnetic Daniel Craig, the new James Bond. Craig, blonde with deep blue eyes, as revealed in a sniper scene, looks ironically like a perfect example of an Aryan. Ciarn Hinds, who played the Russian President Nemerov in 2002's The Sum of All Fears, is the clean-up guy who removes evidence. Mathieu Kassovitz plays Robert, the toy-maker turned bomb disposal expert turned bomb-maker. Hanns Zischler is Hans, the document forger. Showing up occasionally as the official liaison between Mossad and Avner's team is Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim.

Prime Minister Meier endorses the mission by saying ""...every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Other dialogue in the film that resonates with the Israeli perspective includes Avner's mother saying that the Jews had to create their own homeland since no one was going to give it to them. These are examples of why Palestinians groups see this film as biased towards Israel, but to dismiss it as such is to sell it short, as it offers dialogue that neither side supports, and that those without a stake in the middle-east - most viewers - will chew on it, right to the film's end.

Early on, Avner finds a mysterious source of intelligence who is willing to find the locations of persons of interest who have gone underground, but only on the condition that Avner is working for no government. While he doesn't give up that he is unofficially tied to the Israelis, it's obvious that he is probably Mossad since all his desired targets are Palestinians.

As the team assassinate the bad guys throughout Europe, they also learn that the Palestinians retaliate, killing off magnitudes more people. Not mentioned in the film are the Palestinian refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon bombed by Israeli jets in retaliation, four days after the massacre, which was in turn condemned by the UN Security Council. They begin to wonder if their mission is worthwhile and even moral, with arguments about why they aren't just arresting people for trial.

Also, some of the Palestinians they kill are shown as being regular humans with families, or cultured and intelligent, rather than as one-dimensional bad guys. They feel guilty about some of their killings and one of the characters becomes very heavily burdened. It's this moral conflict that brings the film its best tension. In one of the most electric scenes, Avner, mistaken for a German, has a conversation with a PLO team leader who explains and justifies the Palestinians struggle with Israel for a homeland. This is one of the scenes that is generating criticism among Jewish groups, even though the director is a prominent Jew and supporter of Israel.

  Meir Jolobitz, executive director of the New York-based Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), told Aljazeera.net:

  ""First, the film which claims to be inspired by true events does not reflect true events. Spielberg is inventive.

  ""Secondly, he tries to humanize Arab terrorists by legitimizing their murder of Jews as their only way to establish a Palestinian state.""

  The ZOA has called for a public boycott of the film.

At one point in the film, one of the team members talks about how the Israelis could end up becoming killers like the people they are hunting. Team member Carl replied that they have long been like that, since they had to be killers in order to establish the state of Israel. Now, this sort of statement would be seen to be anti-Israeli since it equates the blood shed by creators of modern day Israel to the Palestinian terrorist - a moral equivalence that some will find outrageous.

The film didn't seem like almost three hours long to me. I was totally drawn in as the film unfolded within the murky confines of international betrayal with its lack of assurance. Is the family that sources valuable information playing all sides? Do they betray friends for money? Are they really Mossad operatives carefully feeding the unofficial team the finest information? Or, are they helping the Palestinian leadership do a little house cleaning? The flashbacks to the massacre itself are also riveting. There's a lot of juicy, factual story not included, such as the Israeli offer to send in one of their experienced commando teams, which was rejected. The German offer to trade money for the hostages and then have high-ranking German officials switch places with the hostages, also wasn't mentioned.

By not pleasing either the Palestinian or the Jewish communities, and yet ironically supporting both by presenting two sides of the dispute in the film, Munich offers a timely opportunity for discourse about sacrificing values in the face of conflict for survival, the increasingly popular moral equivalency debate and on a more basic level, the future of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, especially in the post-Sharon era.

Here's some interesting information from the Wikipedia entry about the Munich Massacre. In the book Striking Back : The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's Deadly Response, published December 20, 2005, by Aaron J. Klein, the author contends that the Mossad only killed one man directly tied to the Munich Massacre, and that was in 1992. He mentions that the real planners had gone into hiding in Eastern Bloc countries and that the ones who were killed off were lesser Palestinian activists. The Mossad made them out to be some of the planners and the PLO trumpeted their importance so the legend of the power of the Mossad grew.

The website also contends that in the 1999 book by the only surviving planner of the attack, Abu Daoud, Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist, funds for the attack were supplied by Mahmoud Abbas, who is currently the President of the Palestinian Authority.",1136764800,,6737,5.027827648114902
1542681,4,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg could have made a film about the vengeance sought and claimed by Israel for the kidnapping/murder of 11 of their Olympic athletes wherein the avengers are implacable, remorseless, stalwart and unaffected by their actions, and their quarry could have been one dimensional comic book villains with scarves and snarls, and each killing a glorified and audience- pleasing vicarious thrill.  In short, he could have made a Chuck Norris movie.

But Spielberg was after something different, a film that is not only a tense thriller, but also explores more fully dimensional characters and what the effects of this type of violence has on the participants. Going beyond a simple revenge plot shoot-em-up required courage and I applaud that.  But delving deeper has the result of making more obvious the strengths and weaknesses of such an exercise.

Surely it is no stretch of the imagination to believe that the men carrying out such a mission, which by its nature must be cold-blooded, would be affected by their actions over time.  They are being good soldiers, true, but this is off the battlefield, and by definition does not allow passion and fervor to rule.  Believing or even knowing your actions are righteous, to carry out executions in the form of calculated murder would wear on any men, lest they be monsters.

The greatest strength of the film is in depicting the difficulty faced by some of the team in doing close-up, face-to-face killing.  Spielberg shows us the nasty, brutal horror of violent death, even when ""deserved"".  There are no Rambo-like happy explosions or shootings.  Human beings are being killed, and even if they are bad and guilty of their own heinous crimes, their deaths aren't pretty.  Even when the act seems justified, neither his characters nor we, the audience, are allowed to bask in self-righteousness about the sordid death of another bad player.  It just isn't that simple.

But having raised the question about the consequences of setting out on a path of well-motivated vengeance and the cycle of violence it may engender, Spielberg runs into trouble providing any alternatives or answers.  What else could Israel have done?  Ignore the murder of their athletes?  How do you successfully counter implacable and unremitting hatred directed at you?  Can you afford the luxury of trying to ""understand"" someone who wants to kill you? Or is the cycle of violence and revenge inevitable until both sides exhaust themselves?  These are questions that face this nation today, and I don't know the answer and neither does Steven.

In the end when Avner says to Ephraim ""Why not arrest them, like Eichmann?"" It is a pathetic answer to these disturbing questions. The Eichmann kidnapping to Israel was a one-of-a-kind operation, and possible because he thought he was safe and hidden. Against Black September, it would have been nearly impossible, and even possibly more violent. Having watched the Germans casually release the 3 Olympic terrorists they held to end another hijacking, I doubt trust in jail terms would be high on the agenda. Hell, the Olympic athletes were taken hostage and eventually murdered over the demand for release of Palestinian prisoners already in Israeli jails!

At any rate, I find this film admirable for its depiction of the soul-numbing result of violence, even violence you can justify.  That Spielberg and Tony Kushner get a bit lost in trying to achieve an over-arching theme or resolution to this dilemma is not surprising, as this is the problem of our age and every age that went before us.  If the only answer to a violent act is an even more violent response, and it may well be, than the human race has a long and sorrowful future ahead of us.  This is not a political opinion, this is a cry from the heart.",1136592000,6,3795,4.951104100946372
1542682,4,B00005JOIH,"Eleven Israeli athletes are kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The situation does not end well and all of the athletes are killed. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier discusses a response, a solution, with her closest advisors. Ultimately, they decide to use force, to show Israel is not weak. They contact Avner (Eric Bana), a former Mossad agent, and ask him to lead a team of men to kill the eleven Palestinians responsible for Munich. His team includes: Steve (Daniel Craig), an Afrikaner adept with cars, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the `cleaner', Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), a toymaker who works with explosives, and Hans (Hanns Zischler), a documents expert. As they fulfill their missions, their doubts grow and the level of danger increases.

""Munich"" directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner, is a powerful, challenging film.

Ostensibly a thriller, the film devotes a significant amount of time addressing the moral issues of ""an eye for an eye"". As the death toll rises, Avner's team has thoughtful discussions about the goals and consequences of their missions. Each target is an individual mission, some are easier than others, but as they set about their jobs, Avner's team works very hard to ensure there is little collateral damage. One target lives with his wife and daughter in Paris and the team quickly aborts the mission when they realize the daughter has returned home unexpectedly. Much of their discussion centers on the moral issues at stake.

Initially, the people who planned Munich, stay in the open, living their normal lives, because they are viewed as heroes within their community. This raises the ire of the team of Israeli assassins. After they take out their first target, receiving no mention in the news, Avner and his team realize they will have to use different methods, methods designed to attract attention and send a message to the community. But these will also be more dangerous, making it more difficult to prevent collateral damage. Their actions begin to form a circle of problems and solutions, solutions and problems.

This circle is also a topic of discussion. As their missions become successful, the Palestinians retaliate. When will the cycle end? Can it ever end if they are successful with all eleven targets? For each target they remove, another takes their place. At one point, they are even dispatched to take out the replacement. The Palestinians also attack new targets, killing innocent people. All of this begins to weigh heavily on the team, affecting them in different ways.

Spielberg does an excellent job of presenting arguments for both sides without forsaking the tenants of a motion picture. The episodic nature of the film aids in this process, allowing the director to present thriller like elements book ended with segments of discussion, introspection, guilt. After each target, there is a natural period of less activity as they wait for the next target, plan for the next mission. As they sit. And wait. And wait. Their minds naturally begin to wander and focus on other things. And they talk. Allowing the characters, and the filmmakers, to discuss the various aspects of their missions. Each member of the team is committed to the cause to varying degrees. All agree that a response is necessary, but Steve (Craig) seems to be the only one who doesn't have any objections to their current task.

As they progress in their missions, work further up the food chain, each of the team members deals with their problems in a different way. Some become depressed, some argue and fight, some shut down. Ultimately, it rips some of them apart.

Avner (Eric Bana) has deep misgivings about it. Bana turns in his best performance as the leader of the group. On the one hand, he has nightmares about the deaths of the athletes, on the other he has moral problems with their mission to assassinate others. He spends a lot of time reflecting, but those nightmares ultimately help him continue, to move forward. As the team leader, he is unable to show much of the doubt he has to his team, he must show them he is strong. One of the methods he uses to vent his frustration is to cook large meals for the team, during their periods of inactivity. As the danger level mounts, he also becomes more and more paranoid, suspecting at one point that the government he works for may have targeted his family. His performance portrays the majority of these emotions without words, allowing his actions to speak for or thinly disguise his emotions.

The rest of the team is also very good. Geoffrey Rush plays Avner's government contact or handler, his contact with a government who claims he doesn't exist. Mathieu Kassovitz (""Amelie""'s boyfriend), Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler are all good, showing their character's moral objections in their own ways. At first, I had some problems with Daniel Craig's (""Layer Cake"", the new James Bond) portrayal of Steve. I just didn't get what he was trying to do, his accent was just plain strange. Then, someone refers to his character as ""Afrikaner"" and it all made sense. His character works, but it is the least interesting because Steve is the least conflicted about their goals.

What Spielberg does is very interesting. He has created a film with suspenseful elements, in an international setting, along the lines of ""The Bourne Identity"" or ""Three Days of the Condor"". Then he blends in political elements, discussions of ideology, morality and more. It shouldn't work. You would think it might be boring. But it does work. And I was never bored for the 165 minutes the film ran. It is a bit of a conundrum that the film should work.

Much like the conundrum Avner and his team face every day of their mission.",1136505600,,5772,4.9107692307692306
1542683,4,B00005JOIH,"Confounding expectations, Steven Spielberg has directed a relentlessly tense thriller based on the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and its aftermath that coalesces its often chilling, suspenseful elements into an almost ""Godfather""-like family saga about the obligation of duty and the crisis of conscience. The epic 2005 film doesn't completely work, but the unpredictable nature of the film keeps the momentum going for most of its 162-minute running time. Spielberg, regardless, should be lauded for taking well-remembered historical events within their context and making them resonate in today's politically charged environment.

Co-written by the estimable Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") and Eric Roth from George Jonas's fictionalized book ""Vengeance"", the movie opens with the familiar archived footage of ABC sports commentator Jim McKay reporting on the Black September terrorists kidnapping eleven Israeli athletes at Munich's Olympic village only to be gunned down hours later at the airport. The story then focuses on an undercover commando team instigated confidentially by Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir but officially disconnected from the Mossad, Israel's counterpart to the CIA. The motley group led by Avner Kaufman, Meir's former bodyguard and the son of a revered Israeli freedom fighter, is charged with finding the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the massacre and assassinating them one at a time. These are indeed acts of vengeance by a country who felt the need for respect as well as sympathy from a watchful global community, and the bulk of the movie is about how the team goes about with the killings.

I have to admit that there is a sense of movie convention in the characters who make up the team - Robert, the guilt-sticken bomb expert; Steve, the sometime intolerably cocky driver; Hans, the ice-cold documents forger; and Carl, the anxious ""clean-up"" man who by default, becomes the conscience of the group. However, the actors inhabiting the parts are all quite strong within these constraints, and there is particular standout work by Daniel Craig as Steve (he seems well poised to play James Bond in the roughhewn Connery manner) and Ciarn Hands as Carl. Alternating fluidly between coolly calculated actions and percolating indecisiveness and using his skills in the kitchen as a cathartic release, Eric Bana brings a soulful and increasingly haunting quality to Avner, the designated leader who somehow retains sympathy for his character while going about the business of killing. At times, he seems like an emotional cipher, but I think that helps in the story flow. And in fact, the complexities behind the politically motivated murders, which take place in a variety of exotic locations, are what drive the sometimes convoluted plotline.

Geoffrey Rush does a convincing Israeli accent as Avner's by-the-book Mossad contact, Ephraim, and Lynn Cohen - yes, Miranda's Eastern European maid, Magda, on ""Sex in the City"" - has a few effective moments at the beginning as the conflicted Meir. The movie, however, is not without its share of flaws. First, there is the red-herring use of a French contact with a father who is apparently legendary in the field of political intrigue and information peddling. While Mathieu Amalric and especially Michael Lonsdale give fine performances as Avner's contact, Louis, and his worldly father, their characters feel more like plot devices from another spy thriller entirely, especially as they expose their dysfunctional family set-up over lunch at a chateau to which Avner must be taken blindfolded. There is also a beautiful woman of mystery at a bar, which actually feels like it was cribbed from a similar scene in, of all movies, ""The Sting"".  There is another flaw in the extended coda where I feel Spielberg misjudges the emotional parallels in the rather contrived cross-cutting between the athletes' killings and a bed scene between Avner and his wife.

Nonetheless, Spielberg is a master when it comes to the set-up of the action sequences, whether it's a plan that goes awry with a child returning unexpectedly home or a shooting spree near the docks of Beirut or the killing of a Palestinian passionate about his inextricable need for a homeland. Naturally, the post-9/11 atmosphere lends particular resonance to all these scenes, though credit Spielberg for not making an overtly political statement along these lines. As always, the craftsmanship behind the production is first-rate, in particular, Janusz Kaminski's dramatically lit cinematography and Michael Kahn's blistering editing. Make no mistake that Spielberg has most definitely made a morality picture about the unending cycle of violence in the Middle East and at the end of it, really doesn't take sides on the issue. Certainly the volatility of the topic has prevented a strong film from Hollywood...at least until Spielberg was willing to helm this one. Kudos for that move.",1136505600,3,4945,5.318414322250639
1542684,4,B00005JOIH,"This is a good, satisfying, if too long and sometimes melodramatic film that lays out a very simple story that makes you think for a long time afterward.  Somehow Spielberg overcomes some of the limitations of a melodramatic script and made something elegant and oddly real.  It made me think more about terrorism than three years' worth of pompous national news programs put together that can't seem to get beyond deep voiced soundbytes.  I am not a Spielberg fan, but I liked Schindler's List and I liked this movie, too.

The movie has a number of imperfections, most notably an inexcusable run time:  stretches of the move are repetitive and could easily have been cut. Second, despite some dazzling one liners, the Kushner screenplay is all too often Hollywoodish and the characters and action more like a fictional novel than an historical one. And third, the fact that the details are reputed to be fictional (though who knows what is and isn't?) can really detract from getting into the movie. For example, the Israeli team are laughably amateur and the French syndicate everyone uses for intelligence is supposed to be both anonymous and yet used by everyone.  I couldn't stop by brain from taking me out of the experience and saying, ""This seems far fetched.  Could this be true?""

At the same time, much may be forgiven here, as a good part of what the film wants to do is to convey the unavoidable typology of fighting terrorists by taking a snapshot of its wide-eyed infancy after the Munich massacre, while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were concerned with other things (each other). For those of us who remember Munich and the rest of the terrorist-laden '70's, there's an emotional connection to the movie that is never disappointed despite the flaws of the source material. Like a Shamalayan movie faithful to the character of the palpable Pennsylvania locations, Spielberg recreates the 1970's in a way that is not at all Hollywoodish (thus clashing with the screenplay) and in a way that makes the time period and locations so real it opened up parts of myself. As in his flawed ""Minority Report,"" the world is better than the script. So when, for example, the screenplay provides a didactic exchange that roots terrorism in an ideal construction of ""home"" as a nation (over family and tribe), Spielberg brings home the emotional and intellectual impact of that on the protagonist, as each successive and inevitable compromise in hunting terrorists (accidental civilian death, dubious or nonexistent evidence, no judicial checks, compromises to gain intelligence, and strategic failure, since killing terrorist leaders usually leads to more militant leaders quickly replacing them) forces him to either fully embrace the same position or leave him a casualty of thinking too much.

A number of people have posted in various places that this is pro-terrorist or some such thing.  Don't believe them:  too many Bill O'Reilly wannabes in this world.  The compromises made in the war on terrorism are shown to be tragic (especially on the ones charged with carrying it out, not so much on those who trumpet their heroism from the safety of home), but that is all the movie says.  It does not say these compromises are wrong or right, and it certainly does not claim anything about moral equivalency.  To say that making a movie about Avner is wimpish on terrorism is to say that any media paying attention to our damaged veterans is unpatriotic.  Judge it for yourself.",1136419200,,3484,4.921501706484642
1542685,4,B00005JOIH,"After the horrific slaying of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany by a group of Palestinian nationalists, the Israeli government decided to get revenge.  The ordeal was insulting.  The world watched as 11 innocent men were killed.  So the government asked a man named Avner (Eric Bana), a government agent, to hunt down and kill the members of Black September, the Palestinian group that carried out the Munich attack.  Along with four other operatives (played by Daniel Craig, Ciarn Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler), Avner ""ceased to exist"" and was given the funds to wipe out Black September.  Forced to leave his wife and unborn child, Avner and his team went from Israel to Western Europe to hunt down and kill the Palestinians.  Using the aid Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a French citizen who represented a group opposed to government (I'm not sure if it's fair to call them anarchists, though), they begin finding the Palestinians.  According to the Israeli government, the preferred method of execution is explosion, so the team stages operations to rig bombs in the homes/hotel rooms of the targets, and one by one, Black September finds tehir operatives being blown up.

But how long can the team keep it up before repurcussions begin to occur?  How long before Black September starts to come after them?  How long until the U.S. government gets wind of the operation?  And how long until paranoia and fear begins to drive the team insane?

Munich successfully shows us the team as neither heroes nor villains.  They are merely caught up in a holy war between to peoples, with neither side being right and neither side feeling as if they have no other choice.  This is a very different film from most of Spielberg's work, but it is highly reccomended for most people.  It is not something to be taken lightly, and is definitely not for everyone.  But it is one of the best movies of the year.",1136332800,3,1934,4.815151515151515
1542686,5,B00005JOIH,"My wife and I saw Munich without knowing very much about the story.  In fact, we thought the story would center on the tragic events of the Olympics rather than the search for the organizers of the massacre of the Israeli athletes.  We found the film to be a little long but with powerful performances, particularly by Eric Bana.  The story centers on Eric Bana's character Avner, who is given the assignment of leading one of the teams to assassinate the leaders of Black September.  The teams are made up of people who are not members of the Mossad since they can be easily recognized.  Avner is selected because having been born in Germany he can better pose as a European and with his background as Golda Meir's bodyguard his commitment is unquestionable.  Avner must cut himself off from all that he knows, including his pregnant wife.  He is working on his own with money placed in safety deposit boxes.  The members of his team are also non-Mossad members and without field experience.  They are motivated by their desire to avenge the murders of the athletes. Geoffrey Rush has an interesting role as Avner's coolly detached Mossad contact and Daniel Craig (the new James Bond) is one of the team members.

Initially, one wonders how the inexperienced Avner can hope to assassinate all 11 members of Black September.  His information is supplied to him by a shadowy French group header by Michael Lonsdale (who was interesting to see again and was well-cast for the part) who is simply known as Papa. This unnamed group offers information to anyone who is willing to pay but as part of the conditions they will not deal with anyone representing a government.  The condition seemed rather academic since someone like Avner, acting on behalf of a government, can easily work with Papa's group as long as he can reasonably claim his non-association.

At first, I was found the planning and execution of the assassinations fascinating as they groped to find a way to carry out their plans.  Their first target is simply shot on his way home then bombs become the weapon of choice used with unpredictable effect.  Stephen Spielberg given us an unbiased view of these events and presents the Palestinian side particularly through the character Ali, who explains to Avner his cause to take back the land that once belonged to Palestine will eventually succeed but only perhaps in 100 years. Avner believes, at first, that he can simply kill the 11 Black September members age stop killing.  But when others replace those who have been killed he questions what he is doing, particularly as members of his team are killed. This is the question that Stephen Spielberg has posed to all of us: How can the killing go on?  What does it solve?

Munich has been criticized by all sides as being pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian; instead it is a mirror of events that are still played out today.  The conclusion of Munich shows that intractable ideas perpetuate themselves and that those who question why so much bloodshed has to be are left out in the cold, much like Geoffrey Rush's Mossad boss refuses to ""break bread"" with Avner.  The greatest flaw of the film is that it is too long. My wife and I were wondering how many assassinations were going to be shown before the story would take a different twist.  One also does not have much empathy with the characters as we ourselves begin the question if they are correct in killing their target or are they merely dupes of the Israeli government.  The film does awaken us to the realities behind the newspaper headlines of the moves and countermoves of people like Avner who can never feel safe and cannot leave behind the killings they have committed.",1136332800,2,3696,4.751173708920188
1542687,5,B00005JOIH,"this movie revolves around religion.  it goes back to the fight between isreal and palestine.  it is a fight over land and a place to call home and religion and to me everything that religion should not stand for.  the plot of this movie revolves around the munich olympics and the murder of the isreali team.  isreal retaliates by assassinating figures that supposedly had a hand in the planning of the munich massacre.  this team is thrown together because each has a specialty that will help eliminate each target.  eric bana plays avner and does an excellent job.  this team operates like a family and are very close to each other, and they are the heart and soul of the movie.  however, to me this movie poses the question how far should people have to go to show loyalty and love for their country.  especially when maybe your country is not completely honest about what your mission is.  the planning and execution of each assassination is very interesting to watch and come to fruition.  often times this movies is very visceral, i mean this in the way that spielberg puts you right in there with the action, the explosions, and the heartache.  i had instant tears when avner hears his daughters voice over the phone, i felt his pain and i saw it in his face and to me it was very real.  the movie is also very visceral at the end when you see the isrealis murdered.  as you watch the movie, think about what is going on.  those men were murdered for no tangible reason other than where they were born and the religion they were born into.  when they are killed tears returned to my eyes, the maliciousness, the hate, the anger, the unnecessariness of the whole situation was too much.  they did not need to die, and it makes me sad, that is as simply as i can put it, i feel pity for people who are blind to what they are taking away when they murder in the name of religion.  sometimes i feel that religion causes more problems than it solves.  i have so much respect for spielberg right now because of the last scene in the movie.  as the credits role look in the skyline and you will see the twin towers standing .  to me it is very important to apply the ideas of this movie and then see how they relate to what happened on 9/11.  the events of 9/11 are incredibly similar to the events of the muncih olympics.  a needless attack over a war that is hard to pinpoint.  and why did this happen, for me it is all about religion and how people feel the need to kill in order to contradict the peace that religion is supposed to bring to humanity.  good for you steven spielberg, i hope to see even more movies like this from you, he got this one right and i hope that people appreciate the message that it delivers.",1136246400,,2724,4.335968379446641

Excellent source material (vengeance by george jonas), and accompanied by his usual top-notch production crew, Spielberg beautifully blends choreographed action sequences with drama which is brutal and heart-wrentching to watch.

Eric Bana yet again proves that he is the best import to hollywood today since Rusell Crowe as he gives his finest, and nuanced performance... definitely Oscar worthy.

If movies can convey a message to the audience, then Munich does...an eye for an eye does not end a feud...it only fuels it",1136246400,,686,5.275229357798165
1542767,3,B00005JOIH,"""Munich"" tells the story of Avner (Eric Bana), who is chosen by Israeli's prime minister, Golda Meir, to avenge the hostage taking and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games. Avner leads a group of operatives whose mission is to track down and assassinate 11 Palestinian leaders wanted by the Israeli government for planning attacks of terroism. Avner discovers a French contact who, for a price, gives him the location of the intended targets. Avner and his men then seek out and murder the Palestinians. Often bombs are planted to create a heightened sense of ""terror"".

What distinguishes this movie from being just another action flick, besides the much better acting and overall high quality of filmmaking, is that the operatives are constantly afflicted by self-doubt and their own conscience as to whether their violent acts are justified. The movie itself doesn't really offer a definite answer to this question. Instead it discusses the various hopes and fears motivating both the Palestinians and the Israelis, especially the mutually shared desire for a national homeland. The movie also talks about the cycle of violence being perpetuated and asks whether this ""eye for an eye"" mentality is actually accomplishing anything.

These are all valid and important topics to discuss. But I do have to admit the movie itself left me kinda cold. It's hard to believe that the actual Israeli operatives that performed these killings did anywhere near the amount of moral ""kvetching"" of the characters portrayed in this movie. They were hired assassins on a patriotically inspired mission after all. Also the film is a bit overlong, at nearly 3 hours, and has that typically Spielberg style of ""epic masterpiece"" that I find  to be sometimes pretentious and overwrought. This is especially true of the almost ridiculous scene near the end where Avner dramatically agonizes over his violent actions while having sex with his wife. Finally, I found it ironic that a film whose theme has to done with the futility of violence to achieve a lasting peace relys so heavily on a series of very violent killings to fuel its plotline. In fact, without these murders to create the action and excitement the film itself wouldn't exist at all or, at the very least, would be a terrible bore. So is violence ever the solution? I wouldn't count on this movie to answer that question.",1136160000,17,2388,4.994974874371859
1542768,4,B00005JOIH,"Much has been said about this film before it has been release. Some critics say this is film sympathies the PLO, I honestly do not see that . But it does portray them as humans though. Others say this a ""pro Zionist"" film I do not see that at all (despite the fact that one of the script writers Tony Kushner IS pro Palestinian and a harsh critic of Israel) . This film does have a slight tilt for Israel though. Anyway lets get to the review

  Munich of course is the story about how Israel strikes back against the PLO after the tragic events at the 1972 Olympics.
  It is one of the most well acted films in recent years Something that recent films has been lacking.

  THe Film mostly concerns about the emotional stress of the mossad agents that carries out the operation. It is more of a spy thriller than a preachfest film that some people have been complaining about (I will concede that the film becomes a bit preachy at the end though hence the 4 stars.). Some intersting things occur in the the film for example one of the targets has a friendly chat with the films main hero Avner in a hotel balcony (not knowing who he is of course) a chat that Avner tries so hard to avoid since the target is going to die very violently in 5 minutes that is just one of the interesting things about the film. THere are many more but you will have to see for yourself.

Some things I do not like about the film is a subplot with the CIA dealing with BLack September. and the preachy cycle of violence things. If it weren't for that then the film would have been a great masterpiece.

TRivia:

 In those days Most of the extremist were not islamist, they were in fact Radical Left Wingers. Islamist did not appear  until the 1980s (HAMAS, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah etc).

Look for a cameo appearence of Ehud Barak in drags (Yes THAT EHUD Barak who becomes the Prime Minister of Israel from 1999-2001)

A film which Spielberg FINALLIES portray Germans other Than WAFFEN SS Neo Nazis we see in his other films.

A more serious trivia the film is based on a book Vengeance by Jonas which has been descredited so do not take this film as full fact.

1542769,4,B00005JOIH,"Steven Speilberg's Munich tells the story of how the Israeli government struck back at the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September who was responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic of 1972.

Eric Bana lead the Israeli counterstrike team (made up of odd assorted characters) that goes after the terrorist organization, using any means possible to terminate their existence. Overall, the movie proves to be well directed and superbly acted by the entire cast. I have my doubts however on the script. It almost tries too hard to be fair to both sides of the fence. The movie uses Eric Bana's character, Avram as the moral compass of what the Israeli was trying to accomplished. Speilberg seem to be asking if the nation could compromised its morals and ethics standards to defend itself against her enemies. It would be nice if Spielberg actually answer that question but he does not. Funny how the man who directed one of the greatest movies on the Holocaust forget the past so easily.

The movie proves to be well made, it could used little bit tighter editing if you asked me, the movie dragged from point to point thanks to Avram's moral self-doubts and interlude with his family. Inspired by a true story, I found the movie to be suspenseful, entertaining and overall, well crafted. Its flaws shouldn't bother most people who enjoyed this type of movie and the movie will leave you much to think about since the United States seem to be in the same position after 9/11 as Israel was after Munich Olympics.",1135728000,10,1549,4.819548872180451
1542770,5,B00005JOIH,"""Munich,"" Steven Spielberg's depiction of the 1972 Olympic massacre and its aftermath, is as perfect as a movie gets. Intelligent, realistic, engaging, well-acted, well-directed and well-written (by Eric Roth and ""Angels in America"" playwright Tony Kushner), it has ""Oscar"" written all over it.

The movie centers on the work of a secret Mossad assassination squad, tasked with killing the architects of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the '72 Olympic Games. The team is a varied lot - young and old, hot and cold-blooded, who share the common task of saving Israel by striking back at its enemies. Along the way, the team must negotiate with others' whose identities and loyalties are questionable at best. Can even the Mossad be trusted to give the team accurate information? Can information merchants Louis and his ""Papa,"" who supply the team with leads, be trusted? Or are they playing the team against it other ""clients"" - playing both ends against the middle?

""Munich"" is realistically and appropriately gory, if that makes any sense. Explosives blow people to pieces. Guns of various caliber do their killing work in a variety of believable ways. Gunfights are messy, loud and confusing. And unlike some of Spielberg's other work, the special effects don't get in the way of the story. Thankfully!

""Munich"" also delves into the personal lives and motivations of the team. Defending one's country takes a psychic toll, which is presented here with pathos. Team leader Avram (sensitively played by Eric Bana), himself the son of a soul-wounded hero, wrestles not only with life and death decisions, but about their morality. When is it right to kill? Is vengeance a good enough motive? What if morally-defensible killing achieves no worthwhile end? And what if one's enemies have good reasons of their own for fighting? The scene in which Avram confronts a PLO commando underlines the moral complexity of fighting a war in which both sides have legitimate grievances and both want the same end: peace for their children. These questions are a sub-current to the action that gives it extra depth.

Along with millions of others, I watched the 1972 Munich massacre unfold on ABC television, between footraces, javelin throws and pole vaulting. Archival footage is combined with movie footage, helping the viewer understand what transpired both before the cameras and out of sight. Some of the old familiar faces and voices- Jim Mackay and Peter Jennings-give the film historical resonance for those old enough to have watched it first hand. Probably because of a lack of film footage, the outcome and aftermath of the massacre have never received the attention that the hostage story did. While this film doesn't dwell on the death of the Israeli athletes in great detail, the story it does tell provides another compelling cinematic layer.

""Munich"" is an incredible film, and it deserves every award it will receive.",1135555200,2,2927,5.102296450939457
1542771,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg again strikes a raw nerve in his somber tribute to his Jewish heritage in ""Munich"". He recounts the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terror group Black September.  Using archived film clips from news reports of the terrorist attack he creates a graphic portrait of the horror generated by this event.  Using a clever cinematographic technique his color film appears to be more a colorized black and white, a washed out, toned down version of the vibrant color schemes seen in todays films.

Eric Bana, previously seen playing Hector in ""Troy"" gives a career defining performance as low level Israeli Mossad agent Avner Kaufman.  Bana is recruited through the highest channels of Israeli government including prime minister Golda Meir to administer revenge for the Olympic attacks.  Bana is separated from his family and made head of a five man assassination team to execute 11 Palestinians identified as being responsible for the attacks.  He is officially made a non entity in Israel so that his actions can have deniability.

Included in his team among others is Daniel Craig playing British accented Steve.  Bana is handled by his Mossad contact Ephraim played nicely by Geoffrey Rush.

The plot lead us through the machinations Bana and his team have to go through to accomplish their mission.  They are assisted by a family of Frenchmen lead by the distinguished Michael Lonsdale who provide information for exorbitant fees as to the whereabouts for their targets.

Spielberg presents a fairly unbiased view of these events also evoking sympathy for the Palestinian cause.  Bana's character in the film, Avner goes through a metamorphosis. his psyche ultimately in turmoil due to guilt and the paranoia of his position. He and his family leave Israel to settle in the U.S..  We realize that although he is beseeched by Rush to return to his homeland, things can never be the same for him there.",1135555200,,1962,5.037151702786378
1542772,3,B00005JOIH,"In 1972, the world was shocked at an act of terrorism played out on the world stage of the Munich Olympics, when a group of Arab terrorists, known as Black September, kidnapped the Israeli Olympic team from their rooms in the Olympic village, and ultimately killed them all.

Faced with this act, and after their defeat of their enemies in the 1967-1969 struggle for their homeland against Arab foes, the country of Israel decides to seek retribution against the 11 men who were involved in the planning of the killings. They struggle with the decision, and the principal of seeking vengeance, but decide they must. They choose, as their instrument, a young Sabra, born in Israel to a hero of Israeli independence. Avram (played by Eric Bana), the young Israeli, was once a bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir. He is impeccably well trained and trustworthy. He absorbs with aplomb the news that he is to be an assassin, to lead an assassination team for the Mossad, and that he will be disavowed by his government if he is caught. His team, four men, is provided to him, along with copious amounts of money to complete his task. His handler, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush in another brilliant performance) is imperious and demanding.

The story is absorbing, the nature of the events shocking, the performances supporting Bana's are very well done. Bana himself is a revelation, and this film should make him a household word.  He is marvelous in his role.  Spielberg ultimately elects NOT to present the film as a justification for what Israel did, but a message about the consequences of seeking an eye for an eye.  He plants seeds of doubt throughout the film, and it is obvious that he has either struggled with his belief that what was done was necessary, OR, he may support what was done, but just want to be more politically correct in delivering his message...that violence to cure violence never works.

I think Spielberg has produced a fine film, and perhaps one worthy of four stars and a whole lot of heated conversation about the outcomes.  The violence is shocking, the message is somewhat unclear...the film runs long, but it is ultimately a thriller of the highest standing, with an ending that leaves the filmgoer unsatisfied.

But I'm giving the film three stars, and that is reflective of the overall effort, less the absolutely appalling scene where the final film of what happened to the Israeli Olympics team is interspersed with Avram's reunion with his wife in their bed.  I found the juxtaposition of these film slices to be the most shameless and ridiculous film stunt I've seen in a long, long time.  Spielberg should be ashamed of this contrivance.  And this single episode far and away detracts from what should have been an important film.

While dodging the bullets of his detractors who will cry false at the ""violence never works"" precept, Spielberg did the unthinkable; allowed himself to edit and present in a way that absolutely cheapened the overall effort.  Disappointing.",1135555200,5,3006,4.870588235294117
1542773,3,B00005JOIH,"Despite the compelling subject matter: Israel avenging the murder of her athletes by the Palestinians at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Steven Spielberg's"" Munich"" generally lacks the forward propulsion to make it as interesting and important as its subject matter.
Though, without a doubt there are several thrilling scenes and terrific performances: for one, Eric Bana as Avner the man to whom Golda Meir (a powerful Lynne Cohen) hands over the power, the money and the right to avenge her fallen athletes and for another Geoffrey Rush as Efraim, Avner's handler.
Bana's Avner is a solid, upright man, a minor field agent used to minor assignments but whose unwavering allegiance to Israel and for all that it stands as well as being the son of a hero and a powerful, forthright mother (a thoughtful, conflicted Gila Almagor) who tells him: ""We (Jews) finally have a place to call our own...We must not let anyone take it away"" (paraphrase).
 Bana is very powerful particularly in scenes that require that he perform deeds that would make most of us shudder and falter...his Avner moves ahead without hesitation. Bana's thoughtful face and resolute demeanor make his Avner a man that many would and do follow into battle. Though he is often racked with soul and spirit numbing guilt and later in life with heart-stopping paranoia, Avner never wavers, never tires, never lets down his guard: his pursuit of revenge is indestructable.
The scenes involving the murder of the athletes are the most gruesome, the most shocking and the best choreographed and edited: these scenes  make their point through the accumulation of  precise, exact and focused detail...there's not an inch of film in these scenes that is wasted....masterful. If only Spielberg had used the same discretion with the film as a whole: ""Munich"" is too long by about 20 minutes, the editing is often flaccid and this is a tragic shame, to be honest for the subject matter is rife with all the things that make for suspenseful, exciting drama.
""Munich"" is graced with several exciting scenes and some magical performances but ultimately it is not a great film though it is a very good one. All the chess pieces were on Spielberg's board, he just chose the wrong moves.",1135468800,28,2233,4.933510638297872
1542774,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg's latest movie ""Munich"" is not to be missed. Based on the book by George Jonas, VENGENCE: THE TRUE STORY OF AN ISRAELI COUNTER-TERRORIST TEAM, it wrestles with the age-old question-- certainly one that U. S. leaders faced after 9/11-- of whether or not nations and individuals, for that matter, have the right to take an eye for an eye or take what they perceive as justice in their own hands without the benefit of a fact-finding tribunal. (The actor who plays Golda Meir says early in the film that ""every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."") And what happens if you get the wrong eye, or if the eye is not guilty of this crime but of another just as heinous. And doesn't revenge breed more revenge and where does it all end? These are obviously hard questions. The film looks at both perspectives.

Six members of the Israeli secret police set out to hunt down eleven Palestinians who allegedly were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. (I still remember the sheer horror of watching the events on television and the sad but beautiful funeral music-- I believe it was something by Beethoven -- when the outrageous events occurred.) All the actors give superb performances. Eric Bana as Avner, the leader of the Israeli group is outstanding. He grapples with the morality question as what he is doing as a killer is contrasted with tender scenes with him and his wife and new baby whom he moves to Brooklyn. Daniel Craig and the other actors as just as good so Bana is just first among equals. The plot moves quickly and is convoluted although not impossible to follow. The sheer number of actors is rather staggering.  Tony Kushner of ANGELS IN AMERICA fame was involved in writing the screenplay. This has to be as good as anything Spielberg has ever done.",1135468800,3,1878,4.740061162079511

7941033,5,B00005JOIH,"Steven Spielberg asks us what does home cost? What is the value of life? What lengths must we go to ensure safety for our country, our ideals, or our families?

Munich is an thoroughly haunting film that depicts the terrorist attacks at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Spielberg painstakingly recreates these horrors so that we might see their barbarity in full. He also details the retaliatory effects from the Israeli government's secret unit of assassins who hoped to avenge the Munich attacks by killing the 11 Palestinian terrorists who organized the attacks.

Munich is part historical and meticulous in Spielberg's attention to detail, while also delving into the emotional stress that the Israeli assassins underwent along with the dehumanization their Palestinian enemies. The fascinating aspect is that both sides, Israel and Palestine, are humanized as real people with complex beliefs, ideals, missions, goals, and a unified desire for an independent country. They all wanted a home. They all had families. It is an incredible movie that takes the time to appreciate and attempt to understanding the other side's story.

The acting from Eric Bana, Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, and Mathieu Kassovitz is truly extraordinary. They each represent complex characters with hopes and dreams. They are all given realistic motivations and reservations about their assignment. They each beautifully perform their respective parts with subtle detail and deep emotional impact. Spielberg balances excellent performances from the entire cast. Munich boasts not only Eric Bana's best performance ever, but also Ciaran Hinds as well. You get to witness the horrors of terrorism, assassination, espionage, gun combat, explosive detonations, and the deterioration of Bana's mind. The effects of his work destroy his character's peace of mind. He slowly breaks down wondering was it all worth it. Paranoia. fear, anger, exhilaration, uncertainty, and cunning are all on full display in Munich.

Munich also incorporates many long panning shots, unique parallel edits, tense still moments, and beautiful close ups. Spielberg's eye for gorgeous cinematography and camera angles persists in stunning fashion throughout Munich. The establishing pans of the visited cities are so cool as characters will walk down an entire street with the camera steadily following them the whole way down. It's astonishingly skilled camera work in every scene. Munich is so well filmed, you'll be breathless in every scene, after every sequence, alongside each nerve testing situation. You are experiencing these instances of violence right alongside the assassination squad members.

Additionally, John Williams score is totally unique to his storied career of composing music for films. It's dark and haunting, adding to the tense situations of each scene. His musical cues parallel the action and violence with intense swells and nervous suspense with every moment. William's score is also sonically unique in his career as he leaves his classical routes for a modern, dynamic, and bombastic aural assault on your senses. It's impressive and keeps you on edge for Munich's duration.

Finally, Spielberg's Munich is perhaps his last great classic film. He proved that he could still make a great, engaging, and indeed, enduring cinematic statement even in 2005. Not until he returned with War Horse, Bridge of Spies, Lincoln, and more recently, The Post did Spielberg shine as brightly. Still, Munich is even more mature and profound in its message and portrayal of violence. Spielberg's comprehensive and thoughtful perspective makes Munich as relevant and gripping as when it was released in 2005. For an inspired take on terrorism and retaliation, watch Steven Spielberg's masterful Munich.",1522281600,,3780,5.475128644939966
