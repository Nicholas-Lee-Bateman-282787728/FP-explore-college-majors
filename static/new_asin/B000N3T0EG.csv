2754717,5,B000N3T0EG,This is one of my favorite shows.  I can't believe it was canceled.  I hope this set has episodes I haven't seen- maybe unaired episodes?  The last episode I saw the kidnapping was still going on.  I 'd really like a happy ending series finale.  If there isn't maybe they'll make a movie or write a book concluding the series?,1171065600,10,326,4.366666666666666
2754718,5,B000N3T0EG,"Kidnapped told the story of a wealthy New York City couple (Timothy Hutton and Dana Delany) whose teenage son (Will Denton) is abducted and, the investigative team assigned to find him (headed by an ex-FBI operative played by Jeremy Sisto).

The series debuted back on September 30, 2006. NBC cancelled it after just three episodes.  The network  told the writers to wrap up the storyline in thirteen episodes but it was pulled off the air after five.

The network posted the unaired episodes online but a lot of people missed them -- slow connections, older computers, etc.

How many other shows have been pulled off the air and will likely never be released? Smith, 3lbs., Reunion, The Nine, Six Degrees, Runaway and on and on...

The fans have been incredibly supportive of this show from the beginning and it is only because of their constant letters, emails and calls that this show is being released on DVD.

Congrats you Knapp-heads!",1170806400,127,940,4.8375
2754719,5,B000N3T0EG,"I'm so glad this is coming out on DVD so soon. I just wish it wasn't cancelled. This was such an AMAZING show. I HIGHLY recommend it!!! Jeremy Sisto along with all the other actors did a WONDERFUL job!!!

2754720,5,B000N3T0EG,"This was the best television drama I have seen in a while.  The writing was simply as good as it gets; the acting was brilliant--everyone perfectly cast; the characterization and plot development the work of a master.  This show did not get its due, and I'm so glad they decided to put it on DVD--the fans would have settled for nothing less, and everyone should get to see this.

For anyone who missed the small chance they had to catch this show, take this opportunity. For all of us who waited week after week, through cancellations, re-schedulings, brain-storming and theorizing-- it wasn't in vain!",1170720000,7,603,4.778846153846154

2754748,1,B000N3T0EG,"The one star is awarded for prompt delivery only. My disappointment with this DVD started with the fact that, although it was advertised as having English SDH subtitles and continued as I watched the first episode. I recognised the cavalcade of B-Grade actors and winced at the clichd characters - or should I say caricatures? - they played. Barely a stereotype was missed in Ep1 and I am sure there will be more in the remaining episodes, which I cannot bear to watch. Originality was kidnapped in the first few minutes and never returned. US drama series seldom sink to the lazy, ""cut corners at every opportunity"", production standards as Australian television, but this plumbs the depths. The only positive is that only a small ransom was charged to liberate this product from the shelves.",1482105600,,793,4.881481481481481

2754799,5,B000N3T0EG,"How did I not know this existed until now!!! For a show that was canceled very prematurely before its due time, it plays out like a really long movie/mini-series and I just didn't want it to end! Don't be deceived by the what sounds like a pretty simple plot...it unfolds creatively and carefully.  Even for those good at solving mysteries may get caught off-guard by how this one plays out.  Cliffhangers/episode ends are chosen very critically and do not feel forced like many others in this genre.  Each episode is considered 1 day, however it's quite silly how much is squeezed into 1 day...but of course this just makes it more fun, and it's not like I work for the FBI or anything to even know how ridiculous it would be.

Cast is PHENOMENAL.
Timothy Hutton...after I tried getting into ""American Crime"", a disappointing show and quite boring character, I sort of forgot that he is such a solid performer.  Even though this came well before, he is such a power force on screen. I hope he comes back.
Myketi Williamson (""Bubba"" from Forrest Gump) - MINI SPOILER ALERT...as you're watching...don't worry he comes back in full force when it's time and he is SO bad-ass.
Dana Delaney...always solid performance of a woman with her sweet, soft exterior, yet leaves just enough to question. I often want to find her irritating in a role but always end up enjoying her performances.
Delroy Lindo...(Note to self: Watch everything he's ever done so far!)
Jeremy Sisto...great as Jeremy Sisto :)
Supporting characters are all well-performed.

One of my minor issues was with the typical ""hot female geeky side-kick who figures things out just in time"".  Very overdone, but being that this is a few years old, I'll give them some leeway on it.

Overall, a great watch.  I wanted to watch non-stop but gave myself a couple days in between and watched a few in a row.  I suggest spacing a few out, to let it last a little longer and to not overdo it.  I was tempted to watch it once a week as it would have as a series, but I just didn't have the self-restraint to do so.

For 13 episodes/3 discs, it's well worth spending $15 on.  Think of it like 2 movie tickets, except the movie is 13 hours!",1442016000,4,2189,4.553571428571429

Okay, there -- you have been warned. Now, on to the actual review....

""Kidnapped"" is a TV series I remember having quite a bit of potential, in my opinion after watching the first episode back when it originally aired. I don't recall why I didn't continue watching it. But when I saw it available from Amazon for five bucks, I thought, ""Hey, I should get that!"" And I'm glad I did. *Tremendous* cast. I don't think there was a miscast role in the bunch. Great dialogue, humor in all the right places. This is a show that definitely could have done multiple seasons.

2754855,5,B000N3T0EG,We watched this over a period of a few weeks. My wife called the twist sooner than I did. Jeremy Sisto was just one of many main characters but he clearly shines as the outstanding actor here. It is too bad this series did not get a second season. We really enjoyed the series.

2754856,3,B000N3T0EG,I started watching this series on line and then decided to buy it. Sort of wish I hadn't. It has a good story line and pulls you right in from the start. The kidnapping plot is rather convoluted with all the people involved and not knowing who is pulling the strings. The ending was disappointing in that the intricacies of the kidnapping are not explained. How did the perpetrator orchestrate the whole thing?  What about motives of those involved? Money of course but other agendas may have been at work here. We learn why the boy was kidnapped but even that explanation left questions. It is like they were not going to continue with this series so rushed the last episode. I like a story all cleared up at the end which isn't the case here. Without these explanations it leaves you hanging.,1424995200,,794,4.5524475524475525
2754857,4,B000N3T0EG,For the price here on Amazon...this is a very good and intriguing series. We are 1/2 way through and are presently clueless as to where or who is behind this kidnapping conspiracy.,1423353600,,180,4.65625
2754858,4,B000N3T0EG,"Jeremy Sisto is wonderful as the ex-FBI guy who makes his living finding people (he was also great in Six Feet Under, if you're wondering where you've seen him before), and for his acting I give 5 stars. Oddly, Dana Delaney seems very wooden as the mother of the kidnapped boy -- she was just blank-faced in most scenes, like she was sedated or something. All the other actors were good as well, and the writing was fine. The problem with this show is that it's just waaaaayyyyyyy too drawn out. After watching several episodes, it felt as if we'd never get to a resolution.",1422403200,,574,4.476190476190476
2754859,5,B000N3T0EG,".

This is such a brilliant series that, like others, I am baffled as to why it didn't continue.  Absolutely fantastic storyline and first-class acting throughout.

I am from the U.K. and we do love our continuing dramas (Barbara Bosson - then wife of Steven Bochco - praised the British for their high levels of concentration when she was at the BAFTA's accepting an award for Murder One).

I am purchasing so many DVDs that have been cancelled after just one season - Trauma comes to mind.

Interestingly, one of the UK's most popular programmes, Coronation Street' has been running for 54-years and screens five half-hour shows a week (2 x Mondays, 1x Wednesdays, 2 x Fridays) and one of the actors who has been in it since Episode 1, and is still in it, is a guy called William Roache who has a son in real life called .......................... Linus Roache ...............  a.k.a.  ADA Michael Cutter in Law & Order and Law & Order SVU.  ...................  AND appeared as the villain of the piece, Agent Andy Archer, in KDNAPPED!!!!!,

Recommend Kidnapped to anyone who enjoys near perfection - and who abhors all the cheap, easy to make, reality shows that all Channels seem to want to force feed us nowadays.

2754881,5,B000N3T0EG,"Kidnapped is a classic example of why I never watch anything on network television. It seems that anything that is written well and performed flawlessly ends up being cancelled due to low ratings. Apparently people who watch commercial TV have a low threshold for quality and intelligently written shows.

With that said, the first I learned of this series was on Netflix. From the get go, my wife and I were riveted by the plot and the superb acting.  It tells the story of a very wealthy NYC family whose teenage son is abducted and the investigation that takes place to find him. The lead role is played by Jeremy Sisto, one of my favorite actors. It also stars Will Denton as the teenage son, Timothy Hutton and Dana Delaney as the parents, and a host of other superb actors.

This show will keep you riveted to your seat and will leave you guessing as to what's coming next. Full of clever and believable plot twists, this is among the most intelligent shows that I've ever watched. Apparently that's why it was pulled off the air by NBC after just a few episodes.

Summary:
Shows about kidnapping have been a staple of TV since, well, forever. Presenting an entire 13 episode series about one kidnapping is a bold and ambitious undertaking and it almost works.

The basic plot is fairly routine; the son of a wealthy New York City businessman is abducted from the limo he is traveling in to his private school. The family hires a fixated private investigator (Jeremy Sisto) to work the case. Soon the FBI get involved in the person of a troubled agent (Delroy Lindo). Both actors are riveting whenever they are on screen.

Things are not exactly what they seem when it becomes apparent that the motive for the evil deed was not exactly money.

Content & Packaging:
3 disks - 13 episodes - Comes with two snap cases - one with one disk - the other with two disk - both slide into a cardboard box with artwork Unfortunately no features or deleted scenes.

Positive Comments:
 There is a strong narrative tension that carries this show and kept my interest.
 This is the only TV series I've seen where all the principal actors were convincing in their various roles.
 The sets and action sequences were visually exciting and contributed to the shows success.

The Cast:
 As mentioned before Lindo and Sisto were excellent. I could go on and on about the cast but I do not believe you will be disappointed with any of them.

Negative Comments:
 Concentrating on one abduction for 13 shows is a real stretch and it's apparent - several episodes seemed like padded filler material that contributed little to understanding the abductors motivation - which is the real ""mystery"" of this series.
 To say that the abductors ultimate purpose is murky and that the plot is convoluted and confusing is an understatement.
 There are so many plotting goofs it almost makes this show a joke if it were less professionally produced and acted.
 There is a very interesting sub-plot with the private investigator and a prisoner that is never resolved since there was never a season two.
 Where are the ""extras"" and deleted scenes?? We know there around somewhere but not in the commercially sold package I purchased - what a shame.

Recommendations:
A very entertaining show even with it's plotting goofs and basically family friendly if you can handle the gore.",1408233600,,2331,4.802005012531328

I read that one reason this show wasn't renewed is because if you missed an episode, yuou were lost with the next episode.  I don't think this was true--look at 24 for instance.

Included in the extras are scenes from the last few episodes including who had orchestrated the kidnapping to begin with and the reasoning behind it. Had I not watched the extras on disc 2, I would have NEVER seen the ending coming and it certainly would have been a MUCH more enjoyable experience.

2754992,5,B000N3T0EG,"I'll add my DELIGHTED review of this wonderful mini-series simply to consolidate the five-star rating and to reassure anyone who is hesitating over whether to buy the complete set of disks. I had never even heard of Kidnapped; it completely eluded me when it was originally televised. As it is, I hesitated over whether to buy the disks, then put one in my Netflix cue (apologies, Amazon). But from the first episode my husband and I were so addicted and so certain that we would watch it again that I promptly bought the entire series AND paid the additional shipping to ensure instant gratification! I agree both with the reviewers who decry the short-sighted idiocy of the network for canceling a show this good, while also agreeing with the slightly more forgiving reviewers who say that a problem with showing this on network TV would have been that if a viewer missed the first episode, he or she would have felt lost trying to catch up later. IF ANYONE ON A GOOD CABLE NETWORK LIKE HBO READS THESE REVIEWS THEN I AGREE WITH THE MYRIAD FOLKS WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOW WOULD BE A HUGE HIT THERE. Any cable network which both repeats episodes and has an ""on demand"" function that allows viewers to catch up would be the natural home for a series like Kidnapped. Even now it could easily be picked up again since the main actors would likely be available. However, for now, treating this as a mini-series, complete in itself, then I must say that it is a faultless mystery-thriller. The need to cut down from the projected 22 episodes to a mere 13 did not actually mar the production, although I'm sure it changed it. There are a few dangling scenes which hint of stories that never had a chance to unfurl, and, given the marvelous acting and even better writing, they would probably have been great fun to watch. But the severe editing serves to make the series more like a VERY taut and concise feature film. Indeed it is vastly better than most feature films that aspire to this kind of nail-biting mystery in which every scene provides fresh surprise! WOW.",1354752000,2,2064,4.611413043478261

I watched the whole series in one weekend and it was awesome - I felt like I was watching a very long movie, not a TV show. It was just completely action packed, adventure, non-stop drama, with twist and turns at every point. I can't believe this show didn't make it.

*minor spoiler alert* The show is about a wealthy family with many secrets of their own who's son is kidnapped in the first episode. They end up hiring Jeremey Sisco's character to help get their son back, who is an ex-cop or something and an expert in kidnap retrievals, instead of contacting the police.*alert over*
It's incredibly complex, and not just a simple kidnapping, and that's how one kidnapping case can last an entire series (which I think was just one season). You never know who you can trust, who set up who, or what is going to happen next. I wish there was more episodes to watch.",1328918400,2,1011,4.349206349206349

Only recently have the networks come to realize that it is difficult to build an audience for any show in a serial format that doesn't offer a conclusion at the end of the allotted programming.  With that said, I don't believe that the network actually aired the entire season and one had to either wait for the DVD release or find on-line.

Very tightly woven plot with several surprises along the way.  Both Sisto and Hutton give great performances.  Not everything is quite what it seems and it keeps you guessing up to the finale.

Regretfully, this type of programming is much more common on the BBC these days.

I won't go into the plot in much detail. Basically, a boy from a rich family is taken. They hire Knapp, a man who is an expert at finding people. The series has twists and turns and is much more in depth than just a simple ransom exchange. After the first five minutes, I was hooked.

Unfortunately, the series isn't entirely wrapped up in the thirteen episodes. Apparently there was supposed to be 22. There are a few questions unanswered, which for someone like me, is really difficult. However, knowing that now, I still would do things the way I did and watch this show. Despite the few things left incomplete the show was great.

Annoying the hell out of Sisto's character and making us dislike him for whatever mysterious crime he has perpetrated having to do with a little girl; an old case that has haunted Sisto's character.  It is a shame that NBC did not give this show more of a chance with better writing, there was a possibility for a series with Sisto's character and Delroy Lindo's character investigating kidnappings with a sideline story of Sisto's character continuing to pursue answers to Rapp's crime.",1295136000,,663,4.954954954954955
2755028,5,B000N3T0EG,"The series is yet another perfect example of how incredibly clueless network executives are.
Apparently this series was one of the first casualties of the 2006-2007 season. After only five episodes they gave it the axe.
Whichever NBC executive pulled the plug on this series, take heart you are stuck on stupid.

Well I just finished watching and then rewatching this on DVD and let me tell you. It is hands down one of the best first season's in the history of television.

It stars the brilliant Dana Delaney and Timothy Hutton as Ellie and Conrad Cain a very wealthy society couple who seem to have everything. But then their teenage son Leopold is kidnapped on the way to school one morning and thus begins their season in hell.

As a result of the kidnapping they engage the services of a man named Knapp (played by the amazing Jeremy Sisto) to find their son. His only priority is to find abducted children, regardless of the means.

The concept is rather cliche'..the desperate rich parents (what skeletons lurk in their closets? is there anyone who doesnt have a skeleton?)and the rogue wildcard working outside the system to bring justice.

But this show was far far far from cliche'.

What sets this apart is the simply brilliant plotline. The incredibly talented cast, and a pace that kept me from getting anything else accomplished today.

I don't want to include any spoilers, nor any hints of spoilers. But I swear to you. Invest your time in this series and it will take you on a ride that you will feel exhausted and exhilarated at the end.
And then you will curse NBC.
Who STILL continues to flog that Law and Order franchise for every drop of watered down blood there is, but pulled the plug after five episodes on a show that was simply genius. GENIUS.",1293926400,8,1771,4.638977635782748
2755029,5,B000N3T0EG,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm one of those people who hates series where everything is spelled out, the good guys are universally good and the bad guys are unambiguously evil. Or that tread old ground hoping to catch a trend. This is one that doesn't fit that mold.

The series is engaging and a bit of a puzzle.  Nothing is what it seems, and the plot kept me guessing.  What type of kidnapper takes a child, asks for $40 million, then blows it up?  Who are all these mysterious people who are one step ahead of the cops?  And what's up with the bodyguard Virgil? (be still my heart he's a warrior to end all warriors).

Yes - there are some loose ends but they involve minor characters who are inconsequential - just props in the kidnapper's schemes.  But really, if you're paying attention, all the clues add up in the end and I love that I missed the identity of the kidnapper until the last episode spelled it out.  The series points guilt at the wrong people while those responsible for the mess hide in plain sight.

Each episode ends on a cliff hanger. The advantage of having watched the episodes back to back is that I didn't have to wait a week (or two) to get my next fix.  Delroy Lindo, Jeremy Sisto and the assistant play off of each other marvelously. The kidnapped ""kid"" Leopold isn't cast as a wimpy rich kid, but is pretty ingenious in not waiting for the cavalry to arrive to try to save himself.

But the other Amazon reviewers are right.  As a broadcast series this would have required a commitment to follow it each week. The writing is taut. The show doesn't regurgitate a lot of ground to catch people up. However the introduction gives a quick synopsis of previous episodes and there are flashbacks interspersed in the episode to help explain a shift in point of view or redirect the viewers attention.  My husband started watching at episode 7 and was enthralled with the action.  In the end, the motive is explained and the lines between good and evil are ambiguous.

This has become one of my guilty favorites.  The last episode ends with the challenge for a new cat-and-mouse game so I went searching to see if season 2 was available.  There wasn't one.  I think that was a bad move.

I worry about how networks cancel a show before they have time to build an audience or a word-of-mouth buzz. If Kidnapped had been on cable (with on-demand to allow audiences to backtrack and catch up) instead of NBC I think we'd have seen a different outcome for the series.  It's interesting to see how many actors were later cast in the Law and Order series.

IMHO If you're looking for something that isn't ""dumbed down"", then Kidnapped is an intelligent series worth the investment in time.",1293321600,5,2726,4.455645161290323

I saw portions of it in tv reruns but was lost as to what was going on and the tv rerun was not being run at the same time slot every day/week nor was the episode number advertised.  However, what I saw on tv peaked my interest in the film, so I ordered a copy from Amazon.  I was not disappointed --- just like a good book that you can't put down --- this was a series that I could not stop watching and I completed watching it over a two day period.  I think the series would have had more success if they covered kidnappings in 4 to 6 chapters, that way if you had to miss a couple of chapters it would not screw up a 3 month show for you.",1292630400,5,908,3.738219895287958

After I bought the whole season and watched each episode, one after the other, it was extremely better than waiting a week. I think they should have made Kidnapped into a mini-series. It would have went quickly and I think more people would have been interested in it. That's just my opinion. I won't give anything away for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but the way it ended, it could definitely have gone on to a second season starring only Jeremy Sisto, or depending on the storyline, the same actors/actresses could have been in it. When I saw it end the way it did, I was thinking, No there has to be more! Jeremy Sisto would have been great in a second season!",1277510400,5,958,4.211956521739131

2755052,4,B000N3T0EG,"So we have Kidnapped. The show premiered on NBC and was canceled after only 5 episodes. This is why I do not get into network TV folks! You get into a show and ""BAM!"" it's gone without a rhyme or reason.

  Lets look at the outline of this show. The show was pitched to the network (NBC) as a season long whodunit. Every season was going to feature a new kidnapping and the core stars of the show would return season to season. A fairly risky move as the viewer MUST watch from the beginning to fully understand whats going on. However the concept has worked on shows like 24. So NBC took the plunge and ordered an entire season.

  However from the ratings of the pilot episode the network knew the show was in trouble and spoke with the producers of the show and asked if they could wrap the entire season in a shorter time span. As more episodes premiered the ratings grew worse and the network moved the show a few times finally putting the show on the worst time lot their is...Saturday Night @ 10:00 PM. After the 5th episode aired the show was officially canceled. However NBC did agree to post the remaining episodes on their website one a week until the the show was completed. Not many people took advantage of this. The remaining shows did air split up over the next year in the middle of the night which makes no sense.

  But lets look at the positive situation of this. The show was completed and every question was answered. A rare gift of canceled shows like this. If you have ever watched the show ""Reunion"" you will know what I mean because ""Kidnapped"" answers the question of whodunit.

  The show was a roller coaster from the beginning episode and seemed a bit rushed getting into the middle of the series. This was because the writers had the season written to be 22 episodes long and had to shorten it down to 13 episodes. Similar to ""Jericho Season 2"" being reduced from 22 episodes down to only 7. The core cast was good with Jeremy Sisto, Delroy Lindo, and rounded out by the gorgeous Carmen Ejogo who played Knapp's (Sisto) assistant. The season stars were Timothy Hutton, Dana Delany, Will Denton, and Mykelti Williamson. The season stars were not as likable as the core stars and Williamson overacted abit although I am a fan of his.

  Funny scene when Knapp (Sisto) is talking with an FBI agent in Times Square in front of the ""Bubba - Gump Shrimp Company"". I found that amusing because Mykelti Williamson was ""Bubba"" in the movie ""Forrest Gump"".

  All in all a good show and a real treat to fans who may have only caught the first few episodes. The series does indeed end with finality and the I will admit did not see the person behind it all coming until the end of the show. What was so neat about it was the whole scheme was a maze built on a maze inside a maze as said by one of the villains. The bad guys had no idea who they were working for as the handlers had handlers.

  Semi unique concept of a show and it's a shame that it didn't take off. However we are blessed with the entire series being released on DVD because we do get our questions answered. I do recommend this feature even though there are a few minor flaws.",1237507200,5,3165,4.348639455782313
2755053,5,B000N3T0EG,"This show is amazing.  Leave it to NBC to mishandle it.

2755054,5,B000N3T0EG,"When this show aired I did not give it a chance simply because I was overloaded on episodic series (Prison Break, 24, Lost) and did not feel strongly enough about the show having seen the previews.  I thought it'd be too ""gimmicky"" and felt that I'd ""catch it on the rebound"".  Unfortunately NBC cancelled the series so I was really happy to get my hands on this DVD set.

From the menu with the attention grabbing phone call & distorted voice stating ""WE HAVE YOUR SON"", I was hooked.  This series is everything that network tv should strive for - a compelling story, great cast, great script & suspense.  I began to figure out who was behind the plot near the end of the 12th episode and found myself crying during the 13th, that's how good it was.

The lead actors are all terrific starting with the cool as Shaft performance by Delroy Lindo as the retiring FBI agent, Mykelti Williamson as the dedicated bodyguard, Carmen Ejogo as the smart as a whip partner to the locator (I loved the scene where she flips the female assassin who dismissed her as a ""computer nerd""), Jeremy Sisto, the troubled locator and finally Dana Delany & Timothy Hutton as the agonized parents.

I was engrossed in this show and stayed up late a few nights to finish it and although the current price is a little high for only 13 episodes, it'll be money well spent if you missed this show during its network tv run.

**I would add the same word of caution that others have commented on regarding the placement of the ""extra"" feature on disc 2.  If you have not figured out who is behind the plot by the end of the disc DON'T WATCH THE FEATURE UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE VIEWED DISC 3!!!",1223337600,7,1659,4.430921052631579

2755072,3,B000N3T0EG,"Like cult-fave ""MURDER ONE"" before it - this was another attempt at a season-long story-line. No matter how good it was - or may have become - it was doomed from the get go becuase of this. Most viewers don't have the patience to sit through something this involving, without letting go after a few episodes. Despite ""24"" seeming to do this - that show is in reality several 2-3 episode arcs, rather than a true continuing story - while shows like KIDNAPPED & MURDER ONE - you had to follow what was happening episode by episode or be lost forever.

The cast -let by Sisto - was spectacular. Strangely, the weakest link of the cast was Timothy Hutton, though I blame this shortcoming on the networks cramming the show into fewer episodes than they originally planned on - making some of the ongoing plots and sub-plots weaker than they should have been ( or abandoned all-together ).

My one complaint about this set - is that the ""documentary"" included on the 2nd disc of the set of 3, does BLOW the mystery/ending of the whole series. In my eyes, it should have been included on the final disc in the series, not the middle one.",1199145600,23,1130,4.480582524271845

2755095,5,B000N3T0EG,"NBC set up ""Kidnapped"" for success last summer, making the pilot for both the show and ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" available on a special DVD through Netflix last summer (the pilot was also available on line).  But when the show premiered it had only 7.5 million viewers for week one and then down to 6.3 million for week two.  With a continuing storyline the networks know that if your ratings go down they are never going to go up, so NBC announced the series would only run 13 episodes instead of the usual 22 and be moved to the graveyard that is Saturday night network television.  This move lasted for two more episodes and then NBC yanked the show from their schedule, posting the other eight episodes online.  Ironically, while I was watching the complete series on DVD I discovered that NBC was actually airing the unseen episodes in the wee hours of the morning.  But the main thing is that with this show, at least, we get to the end of the story (unlike ""Threshold,"" ""The Nine,"" and a whole bunch of other continuing series that ended shortly after they got us hooked).

In the ""Pilot,"" Leopold Cain (Will Denton), the son of rich guy Conrad Cain (Timothy Hutton) and his wife Ellie (Dana Delany), is kidnapped by a group of extremely well organized criminals.  The Cains hire Lucian Knapp (Jeremy Sisto) and his assistant Turner (Carmen Ejogo) to bring their son back alive, but it is not long before the FBI becomes involved.  Running the case is by-the-book Agent Andy Archer (Linus Roach), but due deference is paid to Agent Latimer King (Delroy Lindo), who was going to retire but is not going to walk away from this case.  Besides, Latimer and Knapp clearly have a history that comes into play.  But really matters here is that whoever organized this kidnapping really knows what they are doing, providing multiple layers of insulation and a nasty habit of bumping off underlings once they have done their jobs.  In short, this is no ordinary kidnapping but a contender for the best planned one in history.

We watched the five episodes that aired in prime time so for us watching the first of the three discs in this set was a recap to get us up to speed for the rest of the series.  At that point I convinced that there was something significant about the fact that Leo's bodyguard, Virgil Hayes (Mykelti Williamson), had survived the kidnapping, and turns out to be the case but not in the way I expected (""Gone Fishin'"").  A strength of this series are the twists, where they set up expectations (e.g., regarding Leopold's ability to hold his breath under water), but consistently take things in a different (and better) direction.  Time and time again when you think you know what is going on, this series proves you wrong, and that becomes a big part of the fun.

Obviously one of the most impressive elements of the show is the casting.  Getting Dana Delaney is enough to get me to check out a show, but when you can get Timothy Hutton and Mykelti Williamson to show up for the season, that is pretty impressive.  It is not really until the final episode (""Resolution"") that we understand why Sisto, Ejogo and Lindo get their names up top separate from the rest and how the show would have continued into the future that is never going to happen.  Another thing I liked a lot about the show is that Knapp and King have different approaches to working the case but are willing to work together (""Burn, Baby, Burn"").  The standard approach is to have the FBI give the free-lancer grief, but the show follows the Spenser for Hire approach where the ex-FBI guy is seen as being a help rather than a hindrance.

When watching the complete series you will find yourself wondering if the show would have been as great if it had been stretched out to 22 episodes instead of 13.  You can tell that some of the subplots, such as the ones with FBI Agent Vance (""Do Unto Others"") and Aubrey Cain (""Special Delivery""), were cut off before they got to their payoffs or simply abandoned.  The whole idea of the media covering the kidnapping (""Front Page""), which would have become a staple of the Nancy Graces of the world, is completely jettisoned: you see some stories on the news, but the Cains have no problem walking out of their apartment building any time they want.  Plus, I find it hard to believe Benjamin Rand (""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"") would only stick his finger in the pie once.  However, for the most part these changes do not matter because it keeps the focus on finding Leopold and after what happened last season you have to wonder if less would have meant more for ""24"" as well, because ""Kidnapped"" is a lot more impressive than last's years bad day for Jack Bauer.

This is not to saw that ""Kidnapped"" is without flaws: The villain should know better than to use a fake name that would be a clue and since one of the heroes is smart enough to keep all of his weapons at a secure location then the villain should find a better place for their incriminating evidence than the basement of their home.  But that could be what happens when the writers have to fast forward to the end.  Besides, you have to admire the way the series ends, with a nice little coda that makes you wish this was not the end of the road and a parting shot at NBC that is as good as a wink that these people knew they were doing pretty solid here.",1187308800,6,5357,4.500515995872033
2755096,5,B000N3T0EG,"Kidnapped is ""Without A Trace"" crossed with ""24"" with, IMO, better actors.  Jeremy Sisto, Delroy Lindo (movie star caliber), Timothy Hutton (ditto), Mykelti Williamson (ditto again), and Dana Delaney (probably most famous for ""China Beach"") lead the cast.

If you like drama, if you like shows that don't wrap everything up in one episode, you will like ""Kidnapped.""  The production values are high and the story grabs you in the very first episode.  It's almost like a 10 hour movie thriller.

I do have to mention a few minor negatives.  For one, the telling of the story (the plot and excellent actors) is better than the resolution.  You'll know ""who did it"" by the second to last episode (if not possibly sooner) which takes some air out of the tires for the final hour or so.  Secondly, the resolution is done adequately, but not with a slam dunk like they had in the very first episode with the kidnapping.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that they knew at time of filming the final episode that the show was going to be canceled and they just needed to get the thing in the can and move on.  But these are minor quibbles.  If you the enjoy the ride more than the destination it makes the show worth your time.

So with such a great cast and story, we have to wonder why it was canceled.

""Kidnapped"" came out after the unexpected success of ""Lost"" and ""24."" When ABC showed that you could create and keep a solid audience base with a story that took multiple episodes if not multiple seasons to resolve everyone tried to copy the format.  There were probably at least ten such shows.  Some of them just weren't that good in my opinion.  Most of them certainly did not have the high tension and stellar cast of ""Kidnapped.""

I've complained about Fox canceling such programs as ""Wonderfalls,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Kitchen Confidential"" because they were the type of show that didn't require a viewer to catch every episode to become a fan.  If Fox had just had some patience those shows would have caught on and probably stayed on the air for several years.

But ""Kidnapped"" was different.  You had to catch the very first episode to get hooked.  People knew in advance that the show was going to require an investment of their time so many just didn't even bother watching.  I know I didn't when it aired.  I saw a few ads, but it didn't catch my attention enough for me to bother.  Some of that is NBC's fault.

This is essentially a high tension mini-series drama, not a typical program like ""Without a Trace"" or ""Cold Case.""  It needed to be marketed as such.  NBC needed to put more effort in hyping the show and they really didn't.  This was a show that needed that effort because it didn't have the fantasy/sci-fi hook that great shows like ""Lost"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" have that set them so far apart from other programs.  A kidnapped child, rich parents, a rogue private eye who uses illegal tactics, and the FBI . . . doesn't sound that interesting does it?  Sounds cliche.  But it worked on the screen because of the great actors, the plot was dense, and there was a real mystery behind who was behind the crime.

With that said, it wasn't all NBC's fault.  This show was, for the most part, too good for network TV.  It's called the lowest common denominator.  That's why shows like ""According to Jim"" get created and stay on for years.",1186963200,94,3356,4.527454242928453

I look forward to seeing how his career develops.

Sadly, in their infinite wisdom, the most poorly-managed television network in the industry cancelled this show after only four episodes.  It was replaced with some moronic reality-show slop about ruining people's weddings.  Way to go!  However, I am extremely pleased that it appears the ENTIRE first season is now being shown on television again.

Jeremy Sisto carries the film with a skewed, attractive, literate performance, and Delroy Lindo, as an FBI agent about to retire, but drawn back in by the challenge of the hunt, matches him, scene for scene: even Audra McDonald, who has the capacity to enrich any project she chooses, puts in some brief appearances--but it is the action and suspense of a well-written plot that will keep you watching, and perhaps even catch the odd mythical references swirling around the character Virgil, that are thrown in as depth.

2755116,5,B000N3T0EG,"This is a fantastically entertaining show that plays more like an A-budget film than it does a weekly television series. Great characters and superior production value makes this DVD series set perfect for the fans who experienced the show on NBC and an even sweeter treat for those who have not seen any episodes yet. A total of 13 episodes, running about 40 minutes each, makes this easy to digest in a film-like fashion. Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat on a minute by minute basis. The way the show draws you in makes you feel the anxiety the characters must be feeling. This thing will hook you instantly and keep you on edge until the very last minute in the final episode. For suspense and crime/mystery lovers, buy this now! It is a sure-fire hit!",1179014400,3,770,4.507142857142857
2755117,5,B000N3T0EG,I agree with some of the previous reviews of this show in that it is basically a movie quality production. Most of the actors have had great performances in movies. Each episode is very exciting and keeps you intersted throughout. I would have to rate this the best show of 2006. Its amazing the show didn't get an audience. It would be great if it sells really well on DVD and the network might renew the show.,1178668800,4,411,4.35064935064935
2755118,5,B000N3T0EG,"Extraordinary, compelling thriller. Wonderfully cast, well written, propulsive action and story. Not to be missed! Unbelievable that NBC mishandled the series so badly.

Warning! WAIT to view the extra ""Ransom Notes"" featurette,until AFTER you have finished the series -- the featurette is a spoiler.",1178323200,6,300,5.818181818181818
2755119,5,B000N3T0EG,"fantastic series and overjoyed to see it go the british route with a self-contained storyline (regardless or ratings or cancellation issues), however DO NOT WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURE ""RANSOM NOTES"" UNTIL AFTER YOU SEE THE ENDING.  as is the case with too many box sets, by misplacing the order of the special features they ruin the ending.  otherwise stellar stuff.",1177545600,6,365,5.066666666666666
2755120,5,B000N3T0EG,"Let me start off by saying that this show was a complete surprise.  The show landed on my radar simply because I like to watch all the pilots I can and I had a Wednesday night free.  With that said, Kidnapped is the season's best new show, and not just of the ones that were cancelled.

Kidnapped looks like your run of the mill show at first glance.  With a name like Kidnapped and previews that showed nothing special, it would seem that this show would change the climate of television about as much as another CSI spinoff, but that's not the case, starting with the actors.

Jeremy Sisto does an excellent job as the kidnapping specialist, gelling with every scene and situation.  Timothy Hutton and Dana Delaney work well as the grieving parents, giving out little hints of what is going on inside in every scene.  Delaney especially excels in this category.  Finally, Delroy Lindo plays the experienced cop to perfection.  The rest of the cast is just as good, making every scene work.

Good actors are to be expected in such a series, but good writing is not, and this is where Kidnapped launches itself to new heights.  The writing is outstanding in every way possible.  The dramatic scenes and emotional dialogue are aced with ease while Sisto's Knapp is given witty and humorous dialogue at all the right times.  Not to mention the kidnapping story is done extremely well, handing out surprises around every corner.

It is so rare that a show like this be so good.  With shows like Lost and 24 steadily losing viewership it would have been nice to see this show thrive, but the show didn't find an audience and was cancelled after just three weeks, even after being moved to the artic tundra of Saturday.  Luckily the show was given a thirteen episode commitment, which is the only reason this DVD exists.  Buy it, rent it, watch it.  It's worth it.",1173744000,39,1859,4.598784194528875
2755121,5,B000N3T0EG,"I'd been looking for it to reappear after football season, then as summer replacement. I guess it goes to show quality has nothing to do with success on tv. Why do the networks continue to believe all viewers have short attention spans and only want to see one-liner comedy? Surface disappears, Jack and Bobby gets critical acclaim, then flushed, Homicide get Emmys then canned, now Kidnapped. I'll definately buy the DVD, but I'm just about done with network TV.They seem to really have lost touch.",1173571200,6,499,4.882352941176471
2755122,5,B000N3T0EG,"Most dramatic TV series cannot sustain more than 20 episodes.  Look at all of the complaints about Lost this season and not moving towards completion.  Kidnapped had a feature film feel for every episode.  There was no filler.  Why?  Because early on, they knew that there would be only 13 episodes.  They had to have narrative drive to get the plot and subplots tied up in 13 episodes.  So, I miss Jeremy Sisto and Delroy Lindo and Dana Delany and Timothy Hutton and WillDenton (the kidnappee) and Mikalti Williamson (what would have happened to his character if the series had been picked up for the year and maybe next year?), it's the way that I miss Nicholson and Damon, and Wahlberg, and DiCaprio after The Departed ended.  I know that each of them will be good in something else again.  So, NBC did us a favor by canceling Kidnapped in its prime.  We can remember it as a great show, not as a show in which Knapp tortures somebody for the thousandth time like Jack Bauer has in 24. British shows like Fawlty Towers and The Office (British version) tend to go for 13 - 25 episodes, then call it a day.  And we remember them fondly.  Our shows go on too long and get flabby.  But not Kidnapped.

If you haven't watched it at all or only saw an early episode or two, you are in for a real treat.  I envy you that you get to discover each episode anew.",1173398400,13,1355,4.321428571428571
2755123,5,B000N3T0EG,"Kidnapping--it's every family's nightmare, and every child's worst fear.

No matter how powerful you are, or how wealthy, a crime like this teaches you that you are truly powerless in the face of evil. But there are people who can show you how to fight back.

This show explores every emotion, every tribulation, every pitfall and every necessary evil involved in trying to find and retrieve a lost loved one. It's gritty, believable and yet so very touching. The hard edges are softened by performances of such depth that you find yourself drawn in from Day One (the pilot episode).

The plot is dense and well-thought out; the banter witty and emotionally charged.

And please, don't miss one of greatest performances ever by a teenage actor on a serialized television drama. Will Denton's Leopold Cain is fascinating--brilliance, determination and fierce self-mastery masked by vulnerability and helplessness. You will not truly know who he is until the last few episodes--Leo's that complex.

His parents, played by Timothy Hutton and Dana Delany, were masterfully acted as well, written so that you never know their true motives or the real motive behind the kidnapping until the end.

Who kidnapped Leopold Cain and why? You have 13 episodes to figure it out! Maybe you will. I was *totally* blind-sided by the true culprit, and that's a sign of brilliant writing.",1171756800,11,1370,5.039823008849558
2755124,4,B000N3T0EG,"I was able to download the rest of the series after it was cancelled. The best part was being able to watch the remaining episodes back to back. There are a lot of major plot twists and turns and it was great not having to wait a whole week for the next one to air,as one would if it had still been on tv. The ending is a bit far fetched but at least it isn't your typical ""who done it"".I won't spoil how it all ends,but if you were enjoying the show while it was airing,you will want to see how it all ends. I think the main problem with the show was that there was so much to absorb each week,you had to remember every plot and subplot from week to week.",1171411200,,656,3.9029850746268657
