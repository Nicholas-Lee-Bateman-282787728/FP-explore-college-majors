8309314,5,B001HPY45O,"Anuna: Christmas Memories is one of those rare concerts/shows so good that it just gets better and better each time you watch it.  The music and singing is absolutely beautiful and the show is perfect for the entire family.
Michael McGlynn and his twin brother, John McGlynn, host the show with some funny bantering and comments in between and after the songs.  The show goes back and forth with the brothers having a Christmas party in their living room with the rest of the group Anuna to each of them (or all of them) singing on stage.  It's a delightful heartwarming transition that I didn't expect and I love how almost every member of the group had a chance to talk in the living room, then sing the song they suggested back on stage.  It makes for a wonderful and enjoyable collaboration of a group where each singer (alone or together) is truly beautiful, special, heartwarming, and inspiring.  The Anuna singers (both male and female) are all amazing and I just love the iconic garb that they all wear when singing: it's so classy and cool. The men in their white cuff shirts and black vests look so handsome and the ladies in their flowing black dresses look so beautiful.  The look and sound of the band feels very pure, spiritual, and Christian and I just love that.
The singers do many stunning renditions of old classics like ""O Holy Night"" that are just heart-melting.  Michael McGlynn just soothes the soul and mind with his angelic voice in ""the First Noel"" along with his brother and the rest in ''O Come All Ye Faithful,"" and ""Silent Night,"" and more.  I love how they decided to do traditional favorite Christmas carols in Anuna's awesome world-famous way while also doing some modern ones in a modern style without going too modern. The group does ""Angels are singing"" and ""Christmas kisses"" in a 50's style with 50's garb while keeping Michael's soaring voice and the singers' precious harmonies still as the center of the sound and music.  (I'm so glad that they stayed a cappella during these renditions and didn't go electric guitar or rock-n-roll!  They only sing a cappella throughout the show with traditional instruments all of which I prefer and were a great joy and relief to me.)
Also included are some ancient Christmas carols like the French ""Noel Nouvelet"" (done so hauntingly, magically, and beautifully by the ladies in an unforgettable way), the Irish ""Codail A Linbh"" (led beautifully by Rebecca Winckworth), and the awesome ""Gaudete"" (led by one of the female's operatic voices with the male choir chanting in the background).  These ancient songs are powerful and beautifully done.
There's a sweet and enchanting dance/play inspired by a child woven into the show as well as a very funny (and still very beautiful sounding) barbershop version of ""Jingle Bells.""  There's a little bit of everything in this Christmas show and it all works.  The show is done in such an imaginative and magical way.  It's truly special.",1516752000,,2958,4.797244094488189

8309318,5,B001HPY45O,"Like a mug of hot chocolate this album soothes away the winter blues with uplifting and beautiful music.  This album contains my favourite versions of O Holy Night and The First Noel, neither of which is my favourite song on the album.  Christmas Memories has a sweet sound with complex harmonies and is just fun to listen to.",1380067200,5,326,4.603448275862069
