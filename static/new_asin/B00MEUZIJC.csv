6575060,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This course was very informative for me. It showed how to shoot a pistol. How to pick out the right pistol for my purpose. It tells you the three ways you will react in a life threatening situation - fight, flight or freeze. It is easy to say I will fight but with out practice especially with the mental/physical reaction, it is hard to say how I would act. A good example: I went to the range with two level 1 pistols (S&W 40 & Klock 40) no practice - first shot, not holding the pistol properly, took out a hunk of hide off my left thumb from the slide because my thumb was behind instead of forward. It was kind of like a half moon above your eye from a rifle scope banging your head from improperly holding a high powered rifle. Both bleed profusely. The course is thorough, informative & enlightening. I have been around guns & hunted every year since the mid 1950's. I would highly recommend this course to anybody that wants to be handgun proficient. All the information is invaluable for conceal carry or not.",1407369600,,1018,4.363157894736842
6575061,5,B00MEUZIJC,Great program that makes you take an honest look at how ready and equipped you really are. Something for everyone regardless of skill level. Provides an understanding of the entire process not just part of it.,1407369600,,209,4.833333333333333
6575062,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This program is absolutely amazing.  Mr. Kilchermann put together an extremely comprehensive program that would be helpful to anyone from the novice to the expert.  I highly recommend this training dvd set and would like to emphasize how vastly important the first section is on the ""mindset"".  Mr. Kilchermann understands that our brain is the greatest tool and asset we have in self-defense.  In addition, it is our greatest liability as well.  This program helps you to re-train your brain and to overcome the physiological and the psychological barriers that our brain sometimes uses to paralyze us and to short-circuit us.  It helps you to understand how to use situational awareness to avoid most dangerous situations and to greatly increase your ability to protect yourself and your family.

The presentation of all of this information is smooth, simple, and understandable.  It is easy to tell how passionate Mr. Kilchermann is about self-defense, not only for himself and his family, but for all motivated citizens who believe in personal responsibility and balance between a peaceful philosophy of existence mixed with a reality based mindfulness.  The dvd's and chapters are well organized and just make sense.  Mr. Kilchermann presents things in a way that is logical and applicable.  There are some instructors that present things in a very intense and fear based type of way.  That is not the case with this training, in fact, it seems that Mr. Kilchermann is the complete opposite.  He is genuine and likeable and seems to want to be able to reach all audiences, especially the people who are apprehensive about self-protection, guns, or carrying concealed.

I am sincerely grateful for this program.  It had confirmed much of what I already felt and intuited, but also taught me so much more than I realized was important.  I believe that it saves lives!  I am extremely impressed with how well this is put together and the use of clear and direct information with powerful rationale behind every concept and idea.

Carrying concealed comes with an extreme responsibility.  Just like with a driver's license or a motorcycle license, just because the state you live in has determined that you meet basic requirements for be licensed, does not mean that you will be skillful enough to handle the situations that come up in front of you.  With a concealed carry permit, you still have to be extremely sure about when and if it is necessary to use that tool as a means of self defense.  This program does a great job of covering these concepts.

I cannot wait to hear more about upcoming training from Mr. Kilchermann regarding practical family defense, home defense, and perhaps even legal defense if you ever have to use lethal force.",1407369600,9,2748,4.967177242888402
6575063,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This educational series is absolutely incredible. If you conceal carry or if you just want some knowledge on how to recognize, be alert and avoid dangerous situations this is a MUST SEE!. The instructor, Patrick Kilchermann is very well versed in everything he teaches. He is also very passionate about keeping armed citizens educated and knowledgable. I highly recommend this to anyone who conceal carries, a hunter or deal with firearms at all. This is also a program that you can keep watching. Everytime I watch I learn something else. This is very professional and well put together. Well done!",1407369600,,599,5.0
6575064,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am a 60 year old veteran who just decided to start carrying concealed.  I've been around shooting and handguns for many years and thought I was ready, but really got a shock when I purchased this program and started watching it.  I didn't think of 10% of the issues I needed to deal with if I was going to carry a handgun safely and effectively....but now I'm confident EVERY morning when I slide my gun into the holster.

I didn't think about my mindset or the mindset of the aggressor.  I feel because of this program I have a better chance of analyzing the situation and coming out a winner whether I avoid a situation or, ""God Forbid"", win the gun fight.  This really gives me an advantage against the bad guys by hopefully being one step ahead of him.

I also thought my firearm skills were adequate to carry a firearm EVERY day.  This program taught me that I still have a lot of work to do refining my skills so I can ""Fight the Good Fight"".  The training portrayed in this program was realistic and straightforward.  I now know what I have to do and why I should do it.

The Gear part of this program taught me how to rate all of the equipment I need so I can make the right decisions in what I buy and what I carry.  I had no problem analyzing the guns, holsters and ammo that I ""thought"" I wanted.  I found some of it lacking and made different choices than I originally planned.  I really appreciated the fact that Patrick did not push select manufacturers of any gear, he simply taught me how to evaluate what was available and make the right decisions.  After viewing this program, and doing my homework, I confidently walked into my local gun shop and ordered my handgun, holster and training/defense ammo.  I have absolutely no regrets in the decisions I've made in this regard.

And last but not least I can't tell you how impressed I was with Patrick who developed and presented this program.  He is extremely knowledgeable and has a tremendous amount of passion that is contagious.  I truly feel that he wants me to succeed and to do it right.

In summary, this is a very well researched, written and produced program that cuts right to the heart of the issue.  Can I be an effective armed citizen that is prepared to take the responsibility required to carry a handgun EVERY day.  The answer to that question after viewing this program and laying out my training regimen for the future is a definite .... YES!!!!!

I looked at a lot of programs before deciding on this one and I definitely think I made the right decision.",1407369600,130,2543,4.412017167381975
6575065,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This is fantastic program!. I recently finished viewing the series over about 10 Days & I have been talking-up the package to my shooting buddies. I have carried on-&-off for a couple of years and am above-average with a handgun / fire-arms in shooting & competency.

I recently decided, however, to become Proficient in personal-defense carry and my first step towards this goal was to Select & Buy a well-rounded, full-spectrum program that covered everything from Mindset through Range Training and into Hardware. I am VERY Happy with this selection I have made!

The fact that the Training Presenter (Patrick Kilchermann) is a very regular guy, straight-forward, sensible, involving presence is a BIG Plus. Although it may sound silly, the fact that I am not getting barked-at by someone on screen who may be a little too ""Macho-Pumped Up"" for his own good was a significant part of my decision to purchase this set over many others.

The progression & break-down of the Behavioral Fundamentals (for both Us & The Bad Guy""), the Warrior-Mindset, Profile-Studies, Confrontation Models, etcbefore even touching a weapon were excellent. Patrick's one-man shooting drills at the range and good explanations of the quick reload-scenarios and different types of automatic pistol malfunctions (and quick-fixes), etc were also really well done.

I guess at this point you can call me a Fan. It was a Good Investment in my future ability to be self-protecting for the rest of my life.",1407369600,60,1479,5.099173553719008

This series is a MUST see for anyone that is considering a Concealed Carry lifestyle and a great resource, inspiration, and eye opener for those, like myself; that have been CC'ing for many years. The many tips, techniques, and strategies that I gleaned from this series that I thought I knew but didn't is invaluable. Very well communicated with good graphical presentations and examples. The presenter is knowledgeable, concise, and engaging; and I felt as if he was talking directly to, and personally training me. Best of all, he lives this series and believes in what he is teaching; and I do now too! I started watching on a Sunday, and could not turn it off. I ran through all 7 discs in 7 nights straight!

It exceeded my expectations in that the depth and breadth of the content and the instructor's delivery style were balanced, intelligent and appropriate for this subject.  Patrick not only delves into all the aspects that come into play when you carry a concealed weapon, but explains the importance of each of the topics to underscore that carrying a combat caliber pistol that you can hit paper targets with does not in itself ensure your ability to successfully defend yourself if attacked.  He covers the vital emotional, psychological, physiological and Legal issues involved that we face in a life-threatening situation so we are prepared with not only the proper gear and skills required, but the emotional resolve to make the best decisions to defend ourselves before, during and after a self-defense event.  Patrick's delivery is intelligent, articulate and passionate.  It is devoid of tacti-cool jargon and pseudo-macho posture, perhaps making it more palatable for the typical citizen to relate to.

6575087,4,B00MEUZIJC,"I'm a firearms instructor that has read a lot of books and reviewed a lot of DVDs.  This is a set that I would recommend.

Patrick Kilchermann has no military, police, or other codified training that would serve as ""credentials""; however, everything he teaches would be difficult to challenge by any instructor.  If you major complaint is that he doesn't have the credentials, then you need to set your bias aside.  I've seen ""credentialed"" instructors that don't know as much as Kilchermann does.

First, the negative - let's get that out of the way: The first DVD is a little preachy and a lot corny for me. But, based on the rest of the DVDs, it is honest and from the heart.  It gives some perspective on the instructor. On one of the last DVDs he goes into how to clean a gun.  Because there  are millions of ways to do it, I won't comment on the actual cleaning.  However, at one point, he discusses wiping down your magazine and cartridges, which is fine, except he states that you can use a light coat of oil on your rag when wiping them down.  The magazine - YES - absolutely use a lightly oiled rag.  The cartridges - NO!  Use a clean dry cloth only.  Oil will seep between the bullet and case, which contaminates the powder.

That's about the only negative thing I have to say about the course.

Now the good:  Almost everything Kilchermann says is backed up with statistics.  Furthermore, everything he says is right out of some of the best books on self defense with firearms.

The material is divided into three categories: Situational Awareness, Practical Application, practice, and safe handling of the firearm, and Gear/Maintenance.

This program puts together situational awareness from ""Facing Violence"" by Rory Miller with techniques to increase your awareness.  A lot of people discuss the four color codes, but never tell you how to implement it and practice it.  This material does that.

The portion on shooting has some great ideas on methods to practice safely and move to live shooting.  Though the one drawback is that this type of shooting does require a tactical bay, which is not available to most shooters.  But this is a wide spread industry problem.  His criteria for success is based on sound statistics directly from FBI reports.

His maintenance portion the only area that I would question.  But as I stated earlier, there's a million ways to clean a gun.  I use Hoppes #9 Solvent like it's Frank's Hot Sauce.  He uses it very sparingly and uses dental tools to pick out and remove carbon.  Admittedly, I'm too lazy and lack the patience to use that technique.",1473724800,21,2597,4.68141592920354

No, that doesn't make me perfect or knowledgeable in all aspects of gun carry, but I have been through a lot of training and I have a lot of experience.  Even so, I was very impressed with the information presented in The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry DVD set.  I highly recommend it to EVERYONE who plans to, or who is currently, carrying a concealed handgun.  I took meticulous notes from watching every second of all the DVDs and I had only one disagreement in opinion, which is regarding why Patrick does not recommend that the Armed Citizen (you and me) not carry, in addition to a handgun, a less-than-lethal weapon.  While Patrick contends that effective communication and avoidance skills eliminate the need for carrying a less-than-lethal weapon, I am not in total agreement with him.  In reality, the plain truth is that there are just some types of people and situations in which rationalization and avoidance skills will not work.  And whenever a physical confrontation does not justify the use of lethal force, I want to be sure that I have a less-than-lethal weapon at the ready to protect myself, my family, and my handgun.  Personally, I carry a kubotan at all times.  It is blunt at both ends, legal to carry (in my state), and I cannot see how any jury would conclude that it is anything other than a piece of defensive equipment.  I would also like to add that the three books Patrick suggested to read are great.  I think I liked The Gift of Fear best.

6575095,5,B00MEUZIJC,"For multiple reasons, I decided it was time to own a self defense gun. Not having any experience with guns (ownership, how to shoot, safe gun behavior, etc.), I knew I would need training before I purchased a gun. I went in to a local shooting range and inquired about lessons. Within a week, I received my first private lesson, of just under 3 hours, from a retired former police officer, ex-Marine, and NRA certified instructor. It cost $125, certainly a reasonable fee. He was patient and thorough. But, when finished my lesson, I did not feel I was really ready and not sure of what type of gun to purchase. I did not want to go into gun ownership without feeling 100% ready. I understood that gun ownership was a big responsibility and should not be taken lightly.

I found this set of DVDs on Amazon, and while initially thinking it was a lot of money, I realized just two more lessons from my instructor would be $250. So, this was not so expensive, relatively speaking, and would in all probability, be much more thorough. It is approximately 20 hours worth. I decided to try it and am very pleased I took the chance. This instruction was very thorough. As a teacher, I can say that the lessons were very well planned out, in logical step-by-step sequence, and very methodical. One can determine that much time went into planning the whole scope and sequence of the program. This is not haphazard; it is extremely planned out from the introduction to the final chapter. Mr. Kilcherman is a natural teacher with a good speaking voice. There are sufficient visuals to demonstrate each chapter, although more could have made the program a little stronger. I am sure the audience for this type of instructional program comes from all backgrounds and experiences, but I would have liked to have seen some of the lessons, particularly the chapters on the options of ways to conceal carry with various holsters and considerations of gun choice, to have included more information for women gun owners. (We don't wear the same types of clothes as men, particularly with not wearing belts on our pants, and our hands are not as large when making choices on which guns to purchase.)

The training that I had received over the years was state of the art at the time, but as most people know everything changes and you find that methods and efficiency changes with newer techniques and understanding.  I found that this course improved my proficiency from the basic stance, all the way to accuracy during movement and position.

It is evident that he wants us concealed carriers to have the proper mental awareness, attitude, and effective firearms training for when it may become necessary to defend ourselves and family. The importance of knowing when to use deadly force is covered well.

Additionally, as a firearms expert, he plainly illustrates the pros and cons of the different types of carry weapons and equipment so that a ""Guardian"" may make a knowledgeable choice in the selection of the weapon.

Some of the true scenarios presented in the The 7 disk Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense course are graphic, but instill the serious responsibility that it is to be a concealed weapon carrier.

Before you spend hundreds on a new handgun, spend the money and time learning about everything else one must consider first!  Yes, this course is pricey; however, to me, it was money well-spent.

I can't say enough about how happy I am that I spent the money. The course paid for itself in less that 30 days (truth!).

I have to say that a lot of the information can be used by new and veteran concealed carriers.

6575112,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I commend Patrick for the commitment to create a very logical and comprehensive training tool for gun owners.  I found it to be very detailed and very easy to follow.  I warn you, it is a very long course, but it can be reviewed a few minutes at a time and still convey the critical elements of gun ownership and carry.
This course by itself helps fill the void that so many gun owners have concerning ongoing training.  For years, my son and I have taught both NRA classes and concealed carry for Oklahoma.  I've consistently noticed there are two categories of people taking the concealed carry class; those that are rather complacent; they go through the class only because it's required to get the carry permit.  They do not expect to take additional classes to further refine their knowledge of firearms and concealed carry.  They consider it like a drivers license; once you have it you don't have to do anything else to be eligible to drive.  This attitude can lead to very dangerous and deadly situations with severe consequences.

Then there are others who want to do it the right way and continue their training and commit to classes that will help them become a knowledgable and responsible gun owner.

I mention the above because this course easily responds to both groups and introduces them to a very comprehensive approach to issues that most people never considered.  This course goes far beyond what can be taught in a concealed carry permit class.

I've seen on various gun owners boards questions pertaining to this course. Many times, the issue/question becomes, ""does this course replace the need for actual hands-on training?""  Patrick would be the first to tell you (and I concur) that this course was never meant to replace hands-on training.  Rather, it is a complement to hands-on training and practice.  In fact, he has a chapter in the course addressing that issue in addition how to train in the field.

We just had an incident here in Tulsa where a voluntary deputy sherriff accidently shot a suspect and killed him.  The deputy immediately disclosed that he intended to draw his taser and drew his firearm instead.  This incident has been given considerable national attention.

I'm amazed that no one has acknowledged the fact that trained individuals respond by the method they were trained.  This deputy did have considerable training with firearms but only one class in using his taser.  His response was a natural response and has actually occurred many times in this country.  Patrick's course is the only course I've seen that goes into detail about this condition of reacting according to one's training and the importance of having the right mindset.

I highly recommend this course.  Gunowners also have access to Patrick's website for additional training that he consistently posts on his site.  Just like the course, these individual courses are very detailed, comprehensive and does a very nice job of explaining what gunowners should consider for safety and competent use of firearms in any situation.

Patrick is passionate about firearm safety and understanding the importance of how to avoid potentially dangerous situations.  He also emphasizes that the mind is the true weapon against dangerous encounters, not the firearm.  The firearm is simply the tool and if the tool is available to the trained individual that has the proper mindset, just about any situation can be handled without deadly force.  However, if deadly force is truly necessary then the course trains the individual how the situation can be effectively neutralized.

I highly recommend this course to all of our students and to anyone I run into that is a gun owner.  In Oklahoma, that's just about the entire population!  :-)  God bless America and our 2nd Ammendment!",1429747200,6,3788,4.954041204437401

6575117,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This is truly an AWESOME product.  I have never received more ""value for the money"" than is found in this training course.  The amount of time, research and honesty that is condensed into these DVD's is simply amazing.  Patrick Kilchermann is an amazing instructor, as well.  His respect for his listeners shines through and he obviously cares very deeply about us all.  He want us to succeed.  Patrick is truly on a mission to make ""Effective Self-Defense"" an integral part of your life, whoever you are.  If you are willing, he is doing his darned-est to make this information part of your being.  This is not an easy task.  I cannot imagine it being done better than Patrick has done it.

I consider this course ""must-see"" information for every person, whether they decide to conceal-carry or not.  You need this information to make informed decisions in your life that pertain to self-defense.  The scope and quantity of information is astonishing.  Patrick takes gun safety to a whole new level.  Heck, he takes EVERYTHING to whole new level!  You are bound to aspire to learn many of these defensive moves.  You will truly understand the importance of ""muscle memory"" (something we all have some awareness of as truth). You will learn how to do effective things automatically (yes, it takes some work!). You will understand why the things he shows you are valuable.  Your mindset WILL be improved.  These DVD's contain things you NEED to know.

I really like the well packaged DVD's.  You actually have the information in your hands, to review at your leisure or even lend to friends you think may benefit.  Most ""information courses"" nowadays are simply downloads.  I loose downloads.  Hard drives crash.  I like these nice DVD's in my hands.  And they are truly NICE:  well produced DVD's with good graphics, video and clear audio.

Patrick obviously cares about the material he is presenting.  He is unswerving in his belief that he is teaching things in the right order.  He is dedicated to making you really good at self-defense.  Safe.  Effective.  Dare I say it?  Free.

I bought the course as soon as I saw the ad, and I rarely make 'impulse' purchases. I have not been disappointed in the course content; it is all that you advertise it to be! I do want you to know that your ad was riveting and very effective in what you wanted to communicate.

I think a real highlight of your course is the information on mental conditioning and threat assessment by Col. David Grossman, Rory Miller, and Gavin de Becker. My wife and I have purchased and read some of the books by these experts as a result of your coverage of their materials.

 I would rate the content of your courses as being very complete and thorough. I especially was challenged and impressed viewing your demonstration video shot at your gravel pit 'range'! That is what we can all aspire to!

6575123,4,B00MEUZIJC,"Like most sheepdogs interested in keeping our Republic safe.... I've invested a good deal of money in firearms self-defense training from some of the best (e.g., attending Massad Ayoob's MAG-40)

I'm immensely frugal; so I tried to do my homework before purchasing this DVD collection. Alas; I couldn't find any bio info about author Kilcherman, (other than his stint working at USCCA.) so I was a little hesitant about buying a ""pig in a poke.""

Mind you, I don't think someone necessarily has to have 20 years experience as a ""snake-eater"" or SWAT commander to be an effective self-defense instructor, but I was a little dismayed to find almost zero info available on Kilcherman's background / education / experiences / training, on either his website, these DVD's, or internet searches. Also, Tactical Timmy seems to be quite a bit dweeby and, while doing a great job at the CCA, is not my first choice for life-or-death training; so there's some hesitancy about his associates.
Nevertheless I do conclude that PK has attended a fair number of training sessions from a variety of instructors and has done a reasonable job of assimilating and distilling their styles. (I'm not quite savvy enough to pin down which school, or which style.)

Obviously the subject of firearms are serious as it gets, and one would be foolish indeed to carry a gun in public for self protection without extensive, exhaustive, and professional training; and this DVD ""class"" or any others cannot possible suffice to teach you all you need to know.

Having said that, I would (with some mild reservations) recommend this product to someone who is very early in the game... and they are simultaneously signing up for hands-on training with the finest instructor they can possibly afford. Those with extensive experience and training can probably pass on this product.

All in all, I was agreeably surprised at how well done this was. I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said it was ""Junk.""  Here's some fast Pros and Cons:

1) Video production quality (lighting, composition, editing, audio, etc.) was acceptable and rarely a distraction.
2) I admit that from the start I was watching for ""gotcha's"" ...but saw no information that would likely to get you killed or sent to prison.  (Note that others HAVE found fault with some of PK's suggestions.)
3) Kilcherman has an above-average communication ability, but he's certainly not flawless: way too many distracting ""umms"" and ""ahhhs"" and ""you-knows"" that professional educators always extirpate from their delivery.
4) The subject matter coverage is acceptably well done; very little fluff, reasonably balanced, and most of the important high points covered. If your only other exposure to firearms is a lifetime of Hollywood movies, this is a good starting-off point to wipe some of that BS out of your cranium.

Cons:
1) As long as you get all your SAFETY TRAINING and manual of arms from a pro instructor you should be fine. I found a few points in the vid to quibble about on safety, but no ""absolute contraindications.""
2) I disliked the fact that all of the chapters on a disc were not listed all together on one menu page.
3) It's been three weeks or so since I've watched the last disc, and I find some of my minor annoyances at the time are fading. A better reviewer than myself would have been writing them down.

I do recall being quite distracted by the Nazi-brown-shirt-looking attire PK wore on the first disk; a regrettable choice in my opinion. (He does discuss later in the course his rationale for the clothes he wears; so be it.)

Normally don't give a crap about clothing, but ... let's just say my own biases ""didn't fully appreciate that outfit.""

(Yes, I know:  ""If that's your worst complaint""...)

(It was after I wrote this I found a more vehement objector to this clothing issue; I'm not prepared to label PK a ""Nazi-sympathizer"" that's just silly and irrelevant.)  moving on...

4) Speaking of biases, PK has settled on the minimalist Glock holster combined with groin carry, and I have some thoughts. a) He doesn't fully cover the pros and cons of that choice. b) He doesn't cover the myriad other possibilities (and the most popular choices out there) in nearly enough detail...and that's my single biggest gig against the program.",1428710400,22,4300,4.894085281980743

6575130,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I've had a gun since 1986. During this time my gun sat quietly in the drawer next to my bed. I took several courses, here and there, but I always quickly lost interest and the gun went back in the drawer. I can't say how I found ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide"". All I remember is I was not looking for gun training. I was just browsing the Internet when I landed on a webpage that was about The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide. The guy wrote about how much he learned from these DVD's. It sounded good and the price seemed reasonable, so I thought I'd try it.  Well, let me tell you, it was a Godsent.

The first thing I can say is the detail Pat Kilchermann put into this training is awesome.  He breaks down every detail statistically, and in a practical real life usable way. The training goes deep into the psychology of a gun fight.  It trained me on how to safely conceal carry, all about ammo, including the degree of damage different calibers will inflict. Let me tell you, there is so much good stuff in these DVD's I could go on and on forever.....

Now-a-days,  instead of my gun sitting quietly in my drawer, I take it out every day and practice dry firing, getting off the X, drawing my gun in less than 2 seconds, trigger pull, and so much more, and it's a lot of fun. BTW, my old gun is gone and now I use a Glock 19 with an MIC holster. I learned this gun and holster combination from the DVD training. ... I love everything I learned about ammo too.  I didn't know anything about ammo, but after the training I walked confidently into a gun store. With my new knowledge I asked the store clerk for 147 grain 9MM ammo. Honestly, and incredibly, he did not know what I was talking about. But, I knew what I was talking about because I learned everything about pistol and revolver ammo from Patrick....it's very rewarding when you know that you know what you're talking about.

One of the best side benefits I got out of Pat's DVD's was this. My wife was always afraid of guns and always refused to go to the range with me. But, after I played the DVD's for her she agreed to go to the range with me. Well, now she has her own Beretta, and is constantly asking me to take her to the range....I love this.

Finally, I have never met Pat, I don't know Pat, and all the words written here are my own....believe me, if you order this wonderful training guide you will love it, like I do, and never regret it....I give it Five Stars!",1428624000,3,2480,4.270788912579957

I love how this training program explained how various types of pistols operate, explains the ballistics of various types of ammo, how to choose from various types of holsters and accessories, various ways to carry a pistol, how to properly hold and aim a pistol, cleaning your gun, etc.  Patrick goes into great detail explaining everything so that anyone who knows nothing about guns and shooting can become very knowledgeable.  I have become a more accurate and confident shooter after watching these DVDs after discovering the mistakes that I had been making.  Unlike classroom training, I can review various areas of the training as often as needed.

I enjoyed learning about a bad guy's mindset and how to improve my mindset to be better prepared for anything.  I especially liked how Patrick teaches that the best thing to do is to be aware of your surrounding and try to avoid any confrontation before it develops into a shootout with the bad guy.

Personally, I purchased a shotgun with a mounted light on the pump mechanism and I did alter the handle to a pistol grip. I keep it under my bed. I can be up, light up where I want and have both my hands on my loaded pump shotgun...seems good to me...always open to suggestions from Patrick.
Sincerely Thank You Patrick,

The information I got out of this is unbelievable, I feel very comfortable inside knowing that I have this knowledge. With the way this country is going I thought it was time to make a change in my life, I found your site and I could not of picked a better place to get information. One thing I due regret is I found you after I purchased A gun I do have others but not for CC well I bought the wrong one after listening to you everything you said about the type of gun to use was not the type of gun I bought and as I ware everyday I keep thinking every day you were right.

6575137,5,B00MEUZIJC,"These DVDs have a great deal of information that is pertinent to anyone that has a pistol and hopes to never use it to protect themselves or their loved ones. It addresses ""preparation, actual incidents, and what you need to know after"". It is a great start to educating yourself in preparation for concealed carry and also having a weapon in your home for self defense. I already knew some of this information, but it really opened my eyes to how much I didn't know or what I knew was wrong. Highly recommended!!",1428624000,,513,4.526881720430108
6575138,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Let me start by saying that I have had a concealed weapons permit for thirty nine years. Here in California that permit has to be renewed through the local Sheriff's Office every two years. Before the permit can be renewed the permit holder must complete a four hour training course that includes shooting the carry weapon(s). The instructors for the training must be approved by the Sheriff and in the time I have been carrying concealed I have had many instructors. My hat's off to those people who take the responsibility and put forth the effort to ""teach"" citizens about concealed carry; however, the reality is that the basic weapons course of eight hours and the renewal course of four hours is not enough time to truly cover the information that is needed to address the heavy personal responsibility of carrying a concealed weapon. I see citizens going through these courses, receiving their permit and then never thinking about the weapon OR practicing with that weapon until it's time for renewal. That, in my opinion can lead to a potentially dangerous situation!
If a person decides that they will carry a concealed weapon then they owe it to themselves, their family and the public to carry responsibly.
Mr. Kilchermann's DVD training course ""The Armed American's Complete Guide to Effective Self-Defense"" is a comprehensive training system that details the many facets of concealed carry. I have just finished the seven DVD training course and it has ""re-charged"" my mind set and renewed the awareness of the responsibility I have carrying a concealed weapon. I am actively using the training to develop my muscle memory. There is vital information in this course that every person who carries should know, starting with one of the most important subjects, situational awareness. The program is put together in a straight forward, no-nonsense manner and I was pleasantly surprised with Mr. Kilchermann's objectivity.
I whole heartedly recommend this training course to anyone carrying a concealed weapon or thinking about carrying a concealed weapon.

Patrick passionately covers every aspect of carrying a gun for self-defense. As someone fairly new to firearms, and seeking to apply for my CHL, I now feel confident that I have a solid foundation to build on after viewing this highly detailed course. I am certainly more mentally and emotionally prepared to carry and effectively use my gun should the need ever arise! How much is that kind of confidence worth to you?

To review these videos, in short, or hours at a time is effective in preparing most anyone to be a responsibly armed American.
It helps at the range, at home, with an instructor, or even deciding if you want to carry at all.

The amount of information is amazing but since it has been 6 months since I went through it as a new CCDW,  Kentucky version of CCW,  I wanted a refresher. The mindset section was amazing. It got me remembering why I first got involved in concealed carry and re-energized me. I had begun to let the consequences become to overwhelming.  Thankfully that has been broken. I enjoy and understand the power and strength we all have again. I recommend this to anyone thinking of CCW or to those that have it. The training is wonderful and the gear (tools) section can save you money and frustration. I wish I had gotten this prior to getting my concealed carry. As the saying goes ""The mind is a terrible thing to waste"" but here we learn it's our greatest weapon by giviing us both the will and determination to be the protectors of those we love and even strangers.

6575147,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Concerned about the deteriorating world situation and more personally the safety of my family in our country today, I began researching requirements for carrying a concealed weapon legally.

Having been a member of our military service, I was familiar with a number of weapons. Having been separated from the military for a couple of decades, I had not kept up with current armament technology because I was busy with life and trusted that our law enforcement officers would have our backs.

When my awareness reached the point that I realized there are situations where the law enforcement community would not be able to respond to my familys needs in time, I began researching armament and concealed carry requirements.

After exhausting the hardware issue, I discovered the CCU course covered much more than I had ever considered all in a 7-disk DVD Program. I am on fixed income and had to seriously consider this program as an investment in my familys current and future safety. I can honestly say it was well worth the investment and I am extremely glad I made the decision.

I recognized the responsibility that carrying concealed would entail. The CCU program addressed all my concerns and I was pleased to learn that the program shared my desire to avoid situations which would place my family in jeopardy. I am much better educated now on not looking like a victim to a predator. This is addressed in depth in Part 1: Mindset.

From my military experience I recalled that when you are going to join with the enemy, it is best to be trained to the point of reflex (muscle memory) with the ability to cause the enemy to lose the will (and or ability) to fight. This is covered in depth in Part 2: Training.

In Part 3: Gear, I was treated to a wealth of information on Guns, Ammo, and other Gear to make wise choices in my pursuit to carry concealed. Patrick Kilchermann has done the research. Hes used what we in training call chunking the information into learnable bites. The video clips elaborate and reinforce every aspect of what is needed to make the commitment to intelligently carry concealed. It is the most comprehensive course I am aware of and worth every penny.",1428624000,,2183,4.731578947368421

Of course I had to do my homework so no one gets hurt (that is, no one who doesn't threaten my family's safety.) I find Patrick Kilchermann to be an excellent trainer. He is clear, safety oriented, well informed, and on top of it, his voice is easy to listen to. The voice actually is important, because the course is quite long. I put it on in the kitchen or in my home office and listened while working. If I missed something, I just ran it over again.

I encourage anyone who feels like they need to explore firearms options to go through this course. With Patrick's advice in mind, I had the confidence to buy my first firearm and am training with an excellent trainer. I definitely am becoming more secure in my skills in every way.  I went on to buy his course on Master Handgun Accuracy, which I am going through now. I also like his Forward Operator Broadcasts as well. I guess the bottom line is that Patrick appears to be a responsible person with have good values I can identify with and knowledge I feel I need at this point. I never thought I would own a gun, but now I am carrying and all the scary stuff going on in the world doesn't bother me as much. I don't feel our family is as vulnerable, as I did before.

Patrick has done a great service in researching a broad spectrum of issues relating to concealed carry, down to some nitty-gritty details.  He presents them with good organization, care and sensitivity.  As a carrier of a handgun and having my concealed carry permit for over 8 years, I thought I knew the essentials, but this course teaches so many aspects of gun issues.  I've learned so much.  I'm also re-thinking where I need to improve.  Multiple camera shots occasionally change the angles to add variety (as a cameraman I'd rather see him looking toward the camera more often - but that's being picky).  The content, however, is top-notch which is hopefully why you're considering this course.  Even my Police Officer son, who has had training from at least 2 different states, 2 SWAT teams and is a Firearms Instructor learned new things from this course and encouraged me to buy it also.

It was the best 'investment' that I could imagine with the total education that I received and the presentation created a wonderful eagerness to hear/see all that was presented. By the way, I have retained the seven DVD set. I have referred back to them on occasions and I purchased the three DVD set of Master Handgun Accuracy.

What sets Pat apart from the majority of instructors out there is his easy going...no nonsense approach to instruction.

Patrick uses the tried and true teaching technique: ""tell them what you're going to tell them , then tell them, then tell them what you just told them.""  Both products, the concealed carry course and master handgun accuracy, are of the highest quality.

6575156,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Hi Patrick,
Where do I even begin.........?
My husband and I started years ago when we took the concealed weapons course but never pursued actually getting the permit.  We heard so many stories about how it puts a target on your back with law enforcement, etc.
But over the course of time I approached my husband many times about pursing the permit but he never was ready to do it. Never really knew why exactly until we watched your DVDs ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide"".  Come to find out he was just concerned for me and my safety. I also learned why I was hesitant while watching. I did not know what I needed to know and I knew I did not know but did not know exactly what that was!  You really portray all aspects of carrying extremely well in the DVD.  You learn quickly to understand that if you still want to carry after watching this course then you truly are ready and you ARE a Sheepdog.  You understand the responsibility that comes with carrying to say it the easiest way and the consequences you could face. After watching this I just hope that all the people I see at stores purchasing guns knows what the hell they are doing and know exactly what they are getting themselves into!  It should be a requirement to have this type of knowledge/training before purchasing a firearm.
Well, I am a woman who does not even remember where she came across your DVD ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide"" but I am delighted that I click the link and made the purchase.  Why did I even click you might ask?  Over the last year I have become concerned with the state of our nation and realize it is a very dangerous place.  Did not know how dangerous until seeing the stats you provided.  If I cant take care of myself, who will?
When we received the DVDs I was so excited. My husband and I over the last month listened to the entire course.  At first, my husband was a skeptic as to how ""good it would be"" and what could he learn but he has listened to every single DVD and we both have come out better for it.  Many years ago he was an Extradition Officer so he at least has had some training.  Me, absolutely zero.  We absorbed the information and with each section felt more and more confident.  I felt/feel  like Im already at the end of the journey ready to carry and protect.  Ha, that is very far from the truth but I feel like I am ready to pursue and have allot more knowledge than before and definitely more than so many of the people out there today since learning from the material you provided. Which really is hilarious seeing that I have never even shot 50 bullets out of my gun. That will soon change though.  I am committed and  will be ready to do my part as an responsible American citizen.
The information on the DVD is so much more than just about shooting though.  I have become aware of my surrounding which is amazing.  I was a code white person all the time.  Terrible I know.  Not ANYMORE!  I am in code yellow most of the time and my husband and I have fun with figuring out what code people are in and where to sit in restaurants and why, who is there, the mood of the place, fire exits, all that stuff!  I am really wanting to share the DVDs with my sisters and brother so that they to (even though they won't carry) will know what to look for and how to AVOID certain situations.
Thanks to your DVD The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide"" I/we are on the path to becoming someone to reckon with  Since watching the DVD we have received our permit to carry.  Although not carrying yet as it is a process.  We purchased new guns according to your specs and are pleased with them.  We purchased our holsters and are ready to pursue the dry firing stage once I find the right purse that I can draw easily and be ready to protect within 2-3 seconds. Once I get the right purse (since I cannot carry on body) I will practice over and over until I have drawn/dry fired at least 3,000 times, then to the range to get used to the actual firing.  We were at cracker barrel and ran into a person who will combat train us.  I am so excited even though a month or two away from being ready to do that.  Im psyched!!  Just wish it could be you Patrick.  I have heard your voice so much I feel like I know you and you are my shining armour.
I am listening to the DVDs for the 2nd time in the car on the way to work.  Amazing what I missed the first time around so I am glad to be listening again.
You do have to listen in increments because of the multitude of information but it is well worth it!
Thank you so much for the DVDs!  They are reasonably priced but the information is priceless!  Oh, by the way I really enjoy the weekly broadcast.

Stay safe, keep up the great works!

6575157,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I recently purchased the ""Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self-Defense"" presented by Patrick Kilchermann. From the start, I realized it was t was such an effective way  to learn and understand what concealed carry really entails, I spent  the next seven days watching each disk, taking notes, and sharing what I was learning with my spouse. The cost of the program was nothing compared to the post-graduate level of teaching that Patrick presented in the seven disks. I received my Concealed Handgun License from the State of New Mexico in December of 2014, and realized that I had just begun the long road to really understanding what concealed carry really means, not only to me, but  to my family and to the social structure we all live in.

Previously, I had been contacted by Front Sight, out of Las Vegas, Nevada, but at that time, I was not interested in a trip to their site to learn their approach.  I was looking for a program I could study at home, and Patrick's complete guide to  self-defense was perfect. Each disk was a gem of learning from mindset, to what to expect in a violent attack, to the proper gear to use.

If you are a new comer to concealed carry, the information in this set will not only educate you, but it could very well save your life. If you are a tenured concealed carrier, though I can't guarantee it, I would bet there are areas that will cause you to say""I had no idea"".

6575163,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I have shot, reloaded, and hunted for 40 years.  I have not carried a gun except to a range or the woods.  But I now view the world as uncertain enough that carrying a handgun makes sense.  One-day classes in my area cost hundreds of dollars and if they are conducted by anyone as macho-acting as the owners of the shop where they are run then I feel alienated just by the mindframe.  This course seemed like a reasonable and affordable way to pick up training that I needed.  I now see it as way more than that, and I support and echo all the good things written in the reviews already posted.  A feature that impresses me, which I don't believe has been mentioned in prior reviews here:  A substantial amount of time is spent early on in the instruction making the observation that having a gunfight is something you really want to avoid.  Certainly so because you might get shot or killed.  But even if you 'win' its going to mess up your life - the law, police, lawyers, courts, media, the process, etc.  Therefore, the course spends time emphasizing ways to avoid a fight:  how to know what does and what does not constitute a situation where use of lethal force is justified, how to become more aware of your situation and surroundings, how to recognize or be aware of being in bad areas and high risk situations (ex: 'alcohol + women + men'), how to avoid trouble so you don't have to get out of it.  I really appreciate the sanity of this approach.  Another feature derives from such a mindframe:  because a gunfight is undesirable, you avoid one at just about all costs.  But, when one can't be avoided you don't go half way - you don't pull a gun and warn that you'll shoot (advertising yourself as the biggest threat to be focussed upon and maybe giving time for someone to get a jump at you) and you don't shoot to wound.  When you must act you act fast and proficiently so as to act successfully in a truly life threatening situation. I like the clarity of this approach.  Avoid a fight if you can; win it if you cannot.",1428624000,,2033,4.36436170212766

I have not had a chance to watch them yet but I am certain that it too will be a great purchase as well.

After hearing about the Concealed Carry University DVDs from some friends, we were eager to watch the series.  Without hesitation, I can unequivocally state that this video series provides some of the best information I have EVER heard regarding use of firearms and how to avoid using firearms.  You won't find this kind of information in a normal concealed carry class.  In fact, we have been unable to find any class in our geographic are that even offers this kind of information.  Moreover, the classes available which touch on a few of the areas covered by these DVDs, cost more than the entire series.  This series has positively impacted our views of the concealed carry process and we have adjusted our attitudes and approach. I only wish we had watched the series before making some costly investments in pistols.  We have recommended this series to our friends and family.  If you purchase the series, I recommend a consistent 1-2 hours every day or so until you have completed the course.  The videos are jam-packed with useful information.  We have gone back over some of the DVDs watching them a second or third time.  NOTE:  If you are looking for a ""glitz and glamour"" production - this isn't the one for you.  But if you want honest, practical, useful information, you can't go wrong with this DVD series.  The series is worth every nickle of your investtment.

BUT it was also a comfort finding out I've made some wise choices that were reinforced by this series. I only wish I had all the $$ spent on vanity purchases of ""the latest and greatest"" gear, guns, ammo as part of my education. I wish I had watched just the three filters chapter for selecting/rejecting guns for carry PRIOR to buying half of my collection (I might have still bought them, but my reasoning would have been based on reality, not a vague notion of how I could ""make"" something work for my situation). Invest in this course and you will save yourself money, for one thing, but potentially you'll save your life or the life of someone you love if you carry concealed.

Before watching the program they made sense to me yet some of the professionals I have encountered didn't support those concepts.  Many conceal and carry classes are taught by Law Enforcement professionals.  They (LE pros) have developed skills and tactics that are consistent with being uniformed and open carry.  This video series is designed for and speaks exclusively to the armed citizen that has chosen to legally carry concealed.  It was refreshing to hear the information, for once, presented from that viewpoint.  Thank You!

My classes involve a large portion of conflict avoidance, and situational awareness. even as a certified instructor I learned at a higher level using Patrick's program. I am deeply committed to giving my students the very best possible training I can to help them protect themselves and their loved ones.  I will review every one of the 7 discs in this program again and again to make sure each time I look at the ideas from a different angle. the knowledge and thought provoking format of this program is beyond five star for sure. This program has absolute must see advice and training to save your life in a critical dynamic incident. The USCCA instructor training was very through as well Plus Patrick had a hand in its creation as well. Bottom line is simply this; If you choose to be a sheep dog and carry a gun concealed to protect you and your loved ones your training from this day forward needs to be continuous and ongoing. no other choice in your lifestyle will match the responsibility of this one.

6575177,5,B00MEUZIJC,"As a firearms instructor for more than 15 years, I am always looking for new content and new ways of teaching and believe me I look at a lot of material. When evaluating new material I look at several factors:
 Content  Is the content complete
 Presentation  Is the material presented in an organized manner, going from a simple task to more complex tasks using a building block methodology.
 Fluff  How much fluff or useless information is in the presentation just to fill time
 Value  What is the value that I receive compared to the course cost.
 Timeliness  Is the material up-to-date with the latest methods.
I have purchased and reviewed Patrick Kilchermanns The Armed Americans Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self Defense and have found the material complete and up-to-date. Patricks method of presentation is simple, and understandable. He delivers the material in a manner that, in my experience, is second to none. He presents a concept and then explains the science behind the concept. As an instructor it is vitally important to understand the science to explain the why we do things this way. There is no doubt that it makes you look more professional. In addition, there isn't a lot of fluff. The content is 99% meat and potatoes. Patrick did an excellent job on this program.

Patrick drives home his foundation points in a well rounded presentation that will broaden your concept of both physical and mental personal safety. You should gain a clear perspective that will protect you from the legal and moral pitfalls one could encounter without the training and disciplines he provides. His thought provoking, well thought out, realistic and experience based concepts helped me as well as my wife who is new to concealed carry.
The negative media and government focus on firearms has fostered a mindset so critical of anyone owning a firearm that our basic rights are being threatened. Taking the course has given us both the insight to better understand the immense responsibility of owning as well as safely carrying a firearm.
Being able to evaluate the situation, discern the best course of action, and avoid life changing mistakes is an aspect that so few consider and it is key to self defense. Worth your time and investment.",1428624000,,1185,4.954773869346734

6575198,4,B00MEUZIJC,"This is a very good Concealed Carry DVD series.  The information is reasonably concise, and presented in a well organized manner. The visuals are well done.  Mr. Kilchermann has designed a very thorough, and easy to follow program.  He is the only presenter.  But, he has a straight forward, business-like style to his various topic areas.  The series flows logically from disc to disc, and from chapter to chapter within each disc.  So, it is possible to easily jump to any chapter of particular interest.

Of special interest to me was a description of two major categories of potential evil doers.  This was a good point made about how we might respond to different types of  threatening situations.  I had not thought to categorize bad actors in this manner.  It was useful info.

I have been carrying for some time with only two 8 hour CCW classes (over a period of a few years) behind me.  Although no bibliography is included; Mr. Kilchermann does refer to some of his source materials for this video series.  This program prompted me to dig more deeply into concealed carry issues.  I was able to check some these and buy a book or two to supplement what this program covers.  I generally found these books to be very helpful.

I think this program set is a good starting point.  There are many sources of information about firearm use, selection, and firearm self defense tactics.  I did not agree with all of the recommendations made here.  But, I still found the series very useful.  In the end, we all have to decide what equipment, training, and tactics are best suited to our particular needs and circumstances.",1428537600,4,1625,4.711743772241993
6575199,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am a detail person. I took a concealed carry class online which I liked very much, but still felt as if I did not know how to handle a gun well enough to be safe for anyone, not even safe enough to practice at a gun range. None of my previous training gave me enough information (or enough detailed information) to feel confident enough to practice. This is part of the reason it has taken me a very long time to practice enough to get a concealed carry license.

I went looking for further training and eventually found a DVD course titled Incredible Handgun Accuracy From The Ground Up by Patrick Kilchermann. It is excellent, giving me enough instruction to feel some confidence. Yeah, I finally feel like I know enough to practice!

While searching for local gun ranges I came across an advertisement titled Sad Truth on why Most CCW Americans are Training to make good Victims: Disturbing statistics on why 95% of armed Americans are not prepared to survive the reality of a deadly situation and how the eye opening self defense truths can help make sure you are ready. It recommends a DVD course called The Armed Americans Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense. Imagine my delight to discover that it is also by Patrick Kilchermann! What an unexpected treat it turned out to be!

The course is AMAZING!!! Patrick Kilchermanns sincere and personable teaching style allows you to feel as if you are attending a private one on one class. He speaks to you, not at you, as if he really enjoys sharing this with you. The oh so very valuable information presented smoothly flows from one easily understood, logically organized and relevant point to another. His verbiage is not too technical for the beginner or too elementary for the expert, so it is beneficial for everyone. The topics in this course are broader in subject and presented with more detail than any other course I have ever seen or heard of, truly all-encompassing. This phenomenal 7 DVD course is the go to encyclopedia for concealed carry/handgun information filled with great graphical illustrations and designed for easy understanding. This wonderful course reaches out to all of us.

Patrick really knows what he is doing. It is obvious he has vast personal knowledge and passion for self-defense. The topics are very well researched and presented in a do it like this and don't do it like that because... format. Patricks teaching style compares common myths and teaching advice to Real self-defense cases. Things are so much easier to understand when the why and why not are explained in detail concerning all the conflicting advice and myths so easily available these days.

He teaches that self-defense shooting and target shooting are vastly different and so is the training. Preferred shot placement for target shooting is to hit the bulls eye with every shot, while preferred self-defense shot placement is basically multiple shots around the trunk, thoracic and head. Target shooting is done while stationary and self-defense shooting is more likely to be done while moving and/or from behind cover. While training for self-defense will help improve your target shooting, this course is for self-defense training.

I am nonviolent. I do not spank children and do not know how to fight. The few times I have seen a physical fight, I immediately burst into tears and ran away. How can I possible overcome this and shoot someone in self-defense?

Well, Patrick teaches mindset training that will help with the physiological and psychological symptoms experienced when confronted with a lethal self-defense situation, including (but certainly not limited to) the most effective course of actions situational awareness and avoidance. Learn how to avoid situation denial or freezing up in a potential confrontation by managing your fear. Our minds can be our greatest asset or our greatest downfall!  How to read a situation and/or aggressor in real life is imperative training, especially with the rise in crime rate and the legal consequences for our self-defense actions. Become impossible to offend. You will learn the best way to handle a self-defense situation is to be prepared for it and avoid it!

Patrick will teach you the proper way to use your handgun for self-defense. He includes the proper stance, the proper shooting grip(s), proper arm and hand position(s) and much, much more that will train you to shoot accurately or give your accuracy immediate improvement. He will show you how to physically respond to an attack from multiple positions and scenarios and how to stop an attacker. Learn the skill of shooting while running forward, sideways or backwards and if you fall down, having to shoot while lying down from your side, between your legs or even if the attacker is close enough to grab your gun. He will even show you how to clear a gun malfunction with only one hand! Most importantly, learn how to protect yourself, your loved ones and others near you in a life threatening situation by being a Self-Defense Warrior. Practice, practice, practice! In a stressful scenario, you will unconsciously and automatically do what you have trained yourself to do during practiceso don't practice doing the wrong thing! Let him show you the correct way to practice!

Patrick will explain what gear works for self-defense, what doesnt work and why. You will learn how to choose the correct self-defense firearm, holster, ammunition, accessories and carry positions. He will introduce ways to save you mega bucks on practice ammunition!

Additionally, Patrick will coach you on what to expect, what to do and what to say if (heaven forbid) you are forced to shoot in self-defense, along with the civil and criminal legal repercussions of doing so.

I wish this course was a mandatory part of every concealed carry class! I never knew how much I didn't know about self-defense until I watched this course. Most concealed carry classes leave you grossly under-educated and under-trained in comparison (to the degree that most concealed carry individuals are a danger to themselves and everyone around them). This course is exactly what my self-defense training lacked. It is not just another training class; it is a fantastic eye/mind opening, life-saving learning experience.

I am better because of this and I hope you will be too. Thank you Patrick!",1428537600,,6360,5.0

6575201,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Amazing - life changing experience by completing this excellent course!

I have had a CCW permit for more than 30 yrs.  I rarely felt the need to carry, and when I did, I did so thinking that it was to protect myself and my loved ones from harm.

The scary truth is that I had never really thought out why I was carrying or what I would REALLY do if I was ever attacked.

Patrick calls this ""Denial"" - we just don't want to believe that horrific attacks can happen to us.  They can happen anywhere and anytime....whether in the rural areas, expensive suburbs, or inner-cities.  I know that I always had that imaginary scenario.....some thug comes up and says ""Give me your wallet"" and then I pull the gun and say ""You've made a mistake.....""  Perps sees gun and runs away......I put gun away and go home and never tell anyone.

What this whole course does is EDUCATE the student on the realities of an attack.
Then on the best way to avoid them.  (Wasn't what I expected a CC course to say!)
Then if you can't avoid - how to defuse them - that drawing the handgun is the last thing any of us would want to do.
Then - if you must stop the attacker - he teaches how to do that effectively.

The course covers IT ALL.  As it says ""Mindset - Training - Equipment""

I have family and friends who have taken courses with Clint Smith at Thunder Ranch.  When I started telling them what I learned from this course, I was AMAZED that it was almost identical to what they had learned!  The mindset training and tactics were the same things taught at Thunder Ranch - the best part is I can go back and review my course anytime I want/need to!!!

I have a completely different view of CC now and I have Patrick Kilchermann to thank for that.

I AM A SHEEPDOG!

Thanks again Patrick!",1428537600,6,1770,4.267267267267267

Recently we have been considering a handgun purchase and we thought it best to become more educated with all of the facets of responsible and safe gun ownership. This ""Complete Guide"" is very comprehensive and provided the foundation of information that we were looking for.  How do you decide on the training you will need, the gun / holster / accessories that you should buy, and the issues that you should be aware of ?  This course was a very good first step for us and we are much better informed and prepared.  Stacie and Steven Kranzley",1428451200,,622,4.585585585585585

Ok, so you're not a novice, what does this course have for you? It will provide you some great insight into concealment issues, ballistics tests and some tactical training.

Patrick's knowledge and honesty are the foundations  used to build this training program.  From my experience that foundation is the only way, the correct way to teach. With respectful seriousness he informs the student with demonstration and example. Some times it may seem a bit repetitious but with such an earnest subject matter that's a good thing. The hard work of research, verification, organizing, planning ,setting up, rehearsing, presenting and finally producing this course has made available, in my opinion, a cost effective excellent  program that may save many lives especially in the times we live.",1428364800,,789,5.450819672131147

The detail and broad coverage of many aspects involved in responsible carry is outstanding. It is obvious that Patrick is passionate about the subject and truly cares about helping others take this subject as seriously as they choose.
Having attended live fire courses by well known world class instructors, and being an certified handgun instructor myself, this course by Patrick will put a responsible citizen in the top 1% of shooters who can be confident they will win in a self defense situation of themselves or loved ones - if they implement his training techniques.
With the way things are going in the world today, you cannot afford to miss out on this instruction if you are serious about the well being and safety of yourself and your loved ones.",1428364800,,1047,4.854748603351955
6575210,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I purchased this 7 DVD boxed set last Fall to become more informed regarding choosing, carrying, training and defending with a concealed carry pistol. Over the next three weeks, I took my time watching the DVDs and frequently paused them to make written notes on the extensive information that is presented. There is a tremendous amount of information in the DVD's and I encourage others to have a notepad nearby when you watch this. This instructional set is well worth the expense and provides much more information than other books that I have read and range training that I have attended. Patrick presents the information in a clear and articulate manner.

Here are a few of the things that I really liked about the DVDs

How to clear malfunctions with just one hand if necessary. Fact based information with a non-emotional procedure for choosing the right handgun caliber and size for you with the clothing you commonly wear. Strategies for increasing your level of conditional awareness on the street, in restaurants and malls. Statistics based information regarding violent acts and reducing your potential to encounter them.  How to avoid freezing up or situational denial in a potential confrontation.  How to manage fear, use breathing and shooting drills to build a warrior spirit with the skills that will aid you if needed. What to say and expect if you use your weapon to shoot in self defense and the criminal and civil consequences of your actions. Clear instructional information for skills and techniques needed to draw and shoot when the attacker is close to you at arms length vs within 21 ft. How to draw and shoot if you end up on the ground on your back or your side or your belly. Drills for moving sideways and backwards while shooting. Strategies for moving and shooting to defend your family or if there are bystanders nearby. There are many sayings in the DVD that will help you in either a mental or a physical way. My favorite for staying calm become impossible to offend.",1428278400,,2003,4.830903790087463
6575211,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Due to an upcoming trip to Yellowstone Park in September I went and passed my Concealed Carry Class January 2015. I wanted  to have some option to protect myself and Wife while traveling and staying in remote frontier cabin. Used my Son""s pistol to pass range part of CC class. Shortly after bought a Springfield XD-s four inch barrel/9mm. I was convinced I was now ready to Concealed and Carry. While searching on line for holster came across Patrick Kilchermann's audio advertisement for his 7 DVD Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense. Quite long but I was amazed how ignorant I was about CC. I am retired so value each and every dollar I spend-border on cheap- but did not hesitate to order his DVD course. Took over a week of watching the 7 DVD's but learned so much and felt more confident of what I was undertaking as CC. If I would have had the course earlier probably would have purchased a Springfield XD Mod B pistol instead of XD-s. Pat's course covers all and everything you need to be confident and able to survive an unavoidable confrontation. His way of demonstrating and talking during the course is never boring-always upbeat.  I am a very docile person but as our World gets more unstable would like to have an option. Please consider this course for you and all that you will protect. Worth every penny. Will look forward to anything more/new coming out from Concealed Carry University.",1428278400,,1442,4.741035856573705
6575212,5,B00MEUZIJC,"As someone who has been shooting for over 50 years and who has had a concealed carry permit ever since they were available in Florida, I was definitely not looking for a concealed carry course. I happened up Patrick's message, however, and I was intrigued. He made a lot of sense, and even more importantly, he had a passion for his topic. I looked into the program further, including the negative comments that you can find on the Internet, and decided to give the program a try. First of all, let me say that his detractors must not have watched a minute of the course. It is evident from the start that Patrick knows his stuff. He has put years of research and practical effort into the program, and it shows from the start. Those that say he just recycles existing information have no idea of how proper instruction works. Sure, there is information that has been in existence for years, but he also puts his own slant on it and adds new ideas as well. Patrick doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but he does present tried and true techniques along with fresh information. It all adds up to an interesting and complete course that can benefit anyone, from a beginner to an old hand. If you are looking for a quick fix, this is not for you. The course is extremely detailed, and repetition is use to make certain that the viewer doesn't miss key concepts. You have to invest your time in all of the course to get the maximum benefit. Fortunately, Patrick is a natural instructor who comes across as informed, dedicated and likable. And you better like him, because he is in almost all of the videos that cover around 20 hours of detailed instruction. The production quality of the videos is good, if a bit homespun. I must admit that I found the videos hard to stop watching when it got to be midnight, and that the lengthy amount of time I spent watched them went by rather quickly. Once the 20 hours was over, I found myself wanting more instruction, so I also ordered the 3-disc set on Master Handgun Accuracy. Since I had spent more time firing rifles rather than pistols over the years, I found this course to be very useful as well. It even includes tutorials on dry-fire practice which I found to be very unique and helpful. In conclusion, I must say that I definitely believe I am better equipped to carry concealed, and much more likely to hit my target if compelled to do so. In today's climate, I wish more citizens would carry a concealed firearm, and in a perfect world they would all be require to take this course. It is well worth the money, but if the price is a barrier, remember you can share it with your friends and at least get a free meal or so in return (worked for me)!",1428278400,,2696,4.4156626506024095
6575213,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am 69 years old and was raised with guns as a normal part of my life, hunting and shooting from a very young age. We lived in a rural area of Kansas where I spent many days hunting and shooting my .22 rifle. Life was simple and over the years contained numerous visits to Wichita and Kansas City with no concern as to our family's safety. That is not the case today (2015). Now many years later and living close to Kansas City, I realized that it was necessary to Carry Concealed for the protection of myself and my family. Concealed Carry is a very serious endeavor. While my concealed carry class was outstanding, I realized that I needed to have more training to be truly effective at making intelligent decisions. I research the subject and found this program. I have been through the program once, completely, not skipping anything. I am now going through the program a second time. This program is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I feel much more confident and with continued practice will become a more competent concealed carry person, who can react reliably, as necessary, if a situation where to occur.

6575216,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Im a 62 year old male living in Texas.  Ive had a concealed handgun permit for about 5 years.  I carry my handgun everywhere, even on vacation.  I thought by taking the concealed handgun test, shooting proficiency test and practicing at the range that I was prepared in case I had to use my firearm.  After going through the 7 disc set of The Armed Americans Complete Guide to Effective Self Defense, boy was I sadly mistaken. My grip and stance were wrong.  I was not shooting with both eyes open.  I did not keep a round in the chamber.  I was target accurate at the range, but I never thought about being combat accurate.  I never thought that I would have about 3 seconds to react to an attack. Most of all, I was not mentally prepared to use my handgun.  These disks will teach you how to recognize and de-escalate threats, the proper grip and stance, how to shoot with both eyes open, how to use one hand and keep moving while shooting, how to reload magazines quickly, how to clear a jammed gun, and how to be combat accurate.  It also gives you information on the types of handguns, holsters, and ammo to buy.  This could have saved me hundreds of dollars.  Patrick Kilchermann introduces these techniques to you, but you have to practice and develop the muscle memory to make them second nature.  Im starting to put some of these techniques to use at the range and already seeing improvement.  I liked this program so much that I purchased the 3 disk set on Master Handgun Accuracy.  I cant wait to get started on those.  I definitely would recommend these to anyone who wants to be mentally and physically prepared to use your handgun to protect yourself, your family, and your property.",1427846400,,1697,4.496732026143791

Got my concealed carry license a year and a half ago, but have not carried consistently because my gut instinct told me I had more to learn despite having served in the Marine Corps.  After watching the entire series, my gut instinct was validated. I had a lot to learn. Patrick has done a marvelous job covering all aspects of concealed carry. He covered topics I never considered, and most importantly, helped me think through scenarios affirming when to use deadly force, when to extricate yourself from the situation if possible, and being prepared for the consequences of any action. He has an excellent discussion regarding choosing a concealed carry weapon, ammo capacity, where to carry, etc. There is a wealth of information presented in the 7 DVD set. I highly recommend anyone getting a concealed carry license to get this set, train, and put into action the knowledge presented. It will assuage the fears your loved ones might have regarding concealed carry and most important, give you the confidence to safely carry and protect yourself or loved ones if necessary. Oh, yes. Big difference in relaxed shooting at the range and combat shooting. If you haven't trained and have confidence in engaging a threat with rounds on target in two seconds, maybe you should reevaluate carrying concealed.

6575218,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This is a great set with tons of very helpful information. I enjoyed going through the program and have revisited it on several occasions to refresh myself on the many fine points that Patrick makes through out the program.

Be safe and carry on.",1427846400,,439,4.641025641025641
6575219,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was somewhat reluctant to purchase this set, I am quite glad that I did (as a result I also purchased ""Master handgun accuracy"" and I am pleased with it as well) .

The program makes you consider many things that you never may have considered. It also reinforces many conclusions that you may have already drawn. The program is well worth the investment in time and money and I would recommend it to anyone (and have).

Once you start watching, you will not stop until the end of the 20 Hr. presentation. There is a lot of repetition but that is how Patrick drives his points home. One principle builds upon the one prior and so on. In the end it all fits together quite well.

I am not sure if I can say that any portion of the set set is better or worse than others. Some of the highlights for me are; avoiding and deescalating bad situations, what you need to do to be prepared for them and how to prepare. I hope to never face a situation that is serious enough to need deadly force, but, if it ever happens this material will be very helpful. Again, I would recommend this to anyone that is serious about self defense.

These five disks cover all the basic facts, and so much more, in simple, precise detail. It is a commonsense, clear presentation that is packed with hours of sound teaching. This program is a balanced, down-to-earth, detailed program that would cost a fortune if taken in individual classes.

6575223,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I recently decided to Conceal Carry and quickly turned to Google for help in finding some training materials.  Quickly, topping my list was the The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense.  I received the 7-Disc Set just a couple days after ordering, and my wife and I have just recently completed the entire DVD set.  What we found was amazing.  Patrick Kilchermann has organized the entire set into very logical chapters, so that we, as ""newbies"" to Conceal Carry were able to feel comfortable from the beginning Chapters dealing with Mindset to the very end of the training that dealt with gear functionality.  And being new to handguns, we appreciated the way that Patrick talked directly to us in these video's just as if we were in the same room.

The pace of the videos made it easy for us to watch one or two chapters per evening but left us a hunger to get back to the videos as quickly as possible.  Additionally, it was helpful the way that Patrick summarized after each chapter and each section of the set.  Another aspect of this training which I hadn't even considered prior to viewing, was an approach that Patrick took to allow us to see situations from the aggressor's point of view.

Even though I had been around rifles most of my life, I had reservations about pistols.  But after viewing this video set, those reservations has disappeared completely and now I have no hesitations to concealed carry. It's all about self-protection and protecting our families.  This training should be required viewing for those applying to get Concealed Carry permits in all 50 states.  In our state, no training at all was required in order to get our permits.  Luckily for us, we utilized this video set at the same time we applied for permits.  Our permits should arrive soon in the mail, and we feel comfortable having recently completed the video series to carry our handguns without hesitation.

A bonus we hadn't expected, is the free Weekly Email Broadcast designed for all those Responsibly Armed Americans who have decided to carry a concealed handgun for self-protection.",1427760000,,2121,4.852777777777778
6575224,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am a 23 year old female who was recently assaulted, and I wish I would of been taught this information many years ago. Nothing is more frightening than being violated and have no control or say just because of your size and strength. I am still only in phase one of the program, but I also watch the broadcasts every week, and I can confidently say that this program is well worth your money and especially your time. They aren't the most appealing thing to watch visually, but that is not the purpose. The purpose is to be informed, and that is exactly what Patrick has done here. Before this I knew nothing about conceal carry or even how to load a gun. My family grew up in down town Chicago where guns are looked at as a tool for police, or if you are not a cop and you have a gun you're up to some sort of criminal activity. Little did I know that getting informed could have completely changed the outcome of my situation.

Like I said I am still only in phase 1 of the program but even just being that far I can confidently recommend this program to anyone. Whether you already carry and know a lot, or are like me and have been told to stay away from guns you MUST take the time to do this program. It will completely change your outlook in a positive way, and could even save your life.

When you're in situations like these the more information you have the better. So even the gun veterans that think they are equipped enough. Please do this program. I have started watching with a group of friends and even the most skilled and knowledgeable person has still learned so much and were only in phase 1!

Even if I couldn't carry myself. Just knowing that someone I spend time with went through this program would make me feel 1000 times safer. You don't realize how unprepared and uninformed you are until you are in that situation, and you are helpless. I can tell you from experience you do not want yourself, or anyone you care for to feel that terrible emotion of helplessness. So once again please take the time to go through this program. You will not regret a second of it!  Lastly thank you so much Patrick for giving me my confidence back.",1427760000,,2160,4.312807881773399
6575225,4,B00MEUZIJC,"Summary:
  1. This set is pricey but worth it. They author knows his stuff and the coverage is encyclopedic.
  2. An index on each DVD and a transcript of all the lectures would be valuable improvements.
  3. Don't EVER rely solely on a book or DVD for handgun training. I know the author would agree that you also need hands-on instruction from someone qualified to ensure you aren't practicing bad habits.

At 7 DVDs, the word ""complete"" in the title seems quite apt. I view it as an encyclopedia of concealed carry knowledge. Patrick Kilchermann knows a lot about concealed carry and handgun skills and techniques, and he obviously enjoys sharing it. This is a set both beginners and experienced shooters can learn from. I'm in the middle - I took a 2 day class with a range exercise to get my concealed carry license, but it wasn't enough for me to feel comfortable actually carrying. Then I took a 4 day class at Front Sight outside Las Vegas (email me at iwcotton@centurylink.net for more opinion on that program) and I started to carry, but also got a sense of what I still didn't know, which was tactics to avoid a gunfight if possible and to win it if necessary. This DVD set provided both another view on the basics I had learned and a great deal of advanced information that I hadn't known.

There is so much information in this set that most people will want to pace themselves when viewing it. I found that about an hour per viewing session was about right. Less often didn't get me through a chapter and more was overload. The DVDs do lack an active index of the chapters (that would let you click and jump to any chapter or even to subsections), so finding the spot where I last left off was a little hard. I recommend adding this for any future edition, along with a transcript of the lectures in a booklet that could fit in the case with the DVDs. This would make it much easier to review the material again at a later time.

You will see a lot of Patrick Kilchermann lecturing in the series, and he can be a bit wordy at times, but this is a subject where getting it wrong could be very harmful, so presenting information clearly, explaining why it is important, and then repeating the message is useful and valuable. Still, it can seem tedious at times if you already knew it.

As with the successor course on handgun accuracy, this DVD set is best of breed, so why did I only give it 4 stars?  Well, the DVDs do need indexes and a separate transcript would also be a good addition, but I wanted my review to be read so I could make one additional point that could save your life: don't rely solely on this DVD set or any DVD set or book about self-defense. Use it in conjunction with instructor-led training so you get the best of both worlds, lectures and demonstrations that you can view and review comfortably at home, and live-fire instruction from someone qualified to ensure you are doing it right.

Be safe out there!",1427673600,21,2944,4.441558441558442

6575228,5,B00MEUZIJC,"After witnessing the life-changing impact of a violent event in the life of a young man who was a long-time personal friend of mine, I, like many others, I trust, reacted by picking up a handgun and taking the 4-hour course at a training range here in my city to acquire a concealed carry license in my state. However, I confess: I just never started carrying. I'm not sure why. Maybe I felt that my friends and/or co-workers would consider me strange. Maybe I was scared I'd shoot myself in the leg. But for whatever reason, I didn't carry. Not even for one single day. Then I found this course (a bit by accident while searching for a decent holster on the web). It sounded thorough. But I had no idea. :-) Yes, the trainer can seem a bit wordy sometimes. But regardless, I watched the entire course. Now here's the proof of the pudding: I've carried every single day since finishing the course. Patrick (you'll call him by his first name too, after viewing the course, because, though it might sound strange, you'll probably start to think of him as a personal friend) single-handedly transformed not only my understanding of gun safety, but also my knowledge and database of case studies, my commitment to practice regularly (and what to do when I practice) AND, perhaps most importantly of all, my attitude about why I carry and what I'm willing or not willing to DO with a handgun.

I'm convinced: This course should be required material for every single applicant for a concealed carry permit in the land. In one viewing, it completely changed my attitude, willingness, and, I trust, my preparedness to respond in case of a violent event toward myself -- but even more importantly, toward my family and/or friends around me. Not just highly recommended. Honestly, it should be legally required. (Now if I just knew that all other concealed carrying citizens had viewed this, I'd also feel a lot safer knowing they had taken the course too!  Seriously.)",1427673600,,1959,4.7251461988304095
6575229,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was somewhat skeptical of this video series when I first learned of it.  I searched the internet for other similar content and found lots of options.  I am relatively new to concealed carry and wanted to ""do things the right way"" if there's a way to understand what that is from the beginning.  I read through the majority of reviews on Amazon and reviewed the lower rated reviews many times.  It seemed to me that the lower rating authors were not the most open minded to the teachings and they felt attacked by Patrick's beliefs and statements.  So I started reading more of the 4 and 5 star reviews and noticed that there was a common denominator and that was the opposite of the low rated reviews where these authors kept an open mind and considered the statements from Patrick.  I discussed this video series before purchase with several of my colleagues that are interested in concealed carry and they too were skeptic due to the high cost and one of them did suggest that we share the expense but no one was anxious to commit to the plan.  Finally I decided to make the purchase on my own.

Some of the other reviews about redundancy, tedious and time consuming are correct.  But doesn't redundancy build muscle memory or emotional memory in this case?  Patrick states over and over that these are his beliefs and he explains clearly why they are his.  He presents facts that he has researched to support his opinions.  At the end everyone has to make their own decisions and these videos provide very insightful information.

When I received my video set I was extremely anxious to get started and complete the entire set in as short of a period as possible.  Once I started watching I quickly realized that this plan would not work and I had to force myself to work through a few episodes at a time and then kind of let things sink and allow myself to think through the content and how it applies to me.  I went back to work and started telling my colleagues about the video series and what I was learning.  They instantly became excited about it and wanted to share the expense and borrow them.  So far I've let one of them borrow the series and asked that he not pay me but share his experience on what he learned.  He kept the series for a little over two weeks and returned it to me.  He has shared very similar feelings on the content that I have and said that it was definitely worth the expense.

I have purchased other video series on these topics since purchasing this one.  The cost was less but so was the content even though many opinions are similar.  Patrick does carry a Glock and you can tell that he is very comfortable with it.  He does not suggest that it is the only handgun that you should use and he gives credit to all of the major gun manufacturers.  He categorizes the guns based on military and police use, which makes a lot of sense to me since reliability and repeatability are required for these organizations.  He goes on to rate many handguns based on physical dimensions, which will affect their concealability, magazine capacity, caliber, and weight.  In the end you have to make an educated decision on what you will carry and you will know the trade offs of your decision.

I would definitely recommend this video series to anyone with an open mind that wants to learn about concealed carry.  Patrick describes many reasons why to carry, how to carry safely, when and where to carry, things to consider for drills and practice, why and how to stay alert and aware of your surroundings, places to avoid and how to avoid conflict to begin with.  A lot of these topics are probably common sense but in today's world it is easy to become distracted with all of the technologies available and we become complacent.  I definitely feel I am a safer concealed carry person due solely to watching this video series and applying what I learned from it and I think anyone else that does the same would make all of us safer.  And I am now better prepared in the event I find myself in a self-defense incident and my odds of surviving are much higher than before.",1427587200,14,4096,4.479784366576819
6575230,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Best training I've ever purchased!  I'm not one to purchase programs I see on-line but I checked out the reviews and took a chance.  Excellent course!  Most programs you forget about a month or two after making the purchase.  Patricks delivery kept me engaged and wanting to absorb everything this course has to offer.  Hes well informed and passionate about making us informed citizens.  After watching the 7 DVDs, now Im informed too.  No more guessing about my decisions if I need to take action.  The course provided me the mindset to think through situations that may be presented to me, helping me make split decisions and reacting.  Im no longer confused about what tools to purchase or making effective choices.  I also understand my legal obligations as a conscientious citizen.  Theres so much valuable information here, Im finding myself going back to watch a second time.
I really cant think of anyone that wouldn't benefit from this program, whether you're contemplating concealed carry, consider yourself an expert or want to increase your situational awareness, there are key learning points, tools and concepts anyone can use.  I use my education daily to keep myself and my family safer.
I highly recommend this program and will continue to recommend this course to my friends, neighbors and family.  The Armed Americans Complete Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self-Defense is education and training Ill use for life.
Thank you Patrick for providing your guidance and making this program something I feel good about purchasing!  Im looking forward to all you have to offer in future education.",1427587200,,1614,5.08745247148289

6575234,5,B00MEUZIJC,This training takes nothing for granted and explains things down to the finest detail. It is excellent for novice handgun owners and experienced owners will find plenty of ways to improve themselves. A lot of information here.,1427587200,,226,5.135135135135135
6575235,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Although I already carried concealed daily when I purchased this course, after sampling the first DVD, I suddenly realized that I had no clue what carrying concealed involved and decided right then to throw myself into the training with dedication. Its really paid off. Knowing now how my body and mind will react in an emergency situation, should one occur, gives me the confidence that I will be able to react appropriately since I am now aware of what to expect of my bodys performance under extreme stress. Another big eye opener was the 911 call training, knowing what to say and not to say when reporting your emergency. I honestly never thought about what I might say openly to the operator and that it would be recorded for future reference in a court of law and may possibly be used against me.

Patrick is definitely predisposed to avoidance for every situation whenever possible, starting with increasing your awareness of your surroundings; however, he gives excellent training on what to do should you not be able to avoid a confrontation. Prior to completion of this course, when at the range, I was target practicing, trying only to improve my ability to hit the bullseye after carefully aiming and pulling the trigger. Now when at the range, most of my practice is geared more toward concealed carry, such as rapid firing from a distance of 21 feet and firing while the target is coming back to the home position, simulating an attacker rushing towards me.

The Gear training was excellent and I wish Id had this prior to selection of my initial gear. Well, lesson learned. Patrick gives valuable information on carry positions. I would never have thought that a flashlight would be such a necessity carry item. Just like the flashlight training opened my eyes, practically everything in this course in some way or another did the same. This course is worth every penny spent and then some. Most other courses just seem to be a bunch of independent DVDs which are not linked together into a training system. From my research, this course appears to be one of the most comprehensive around and is presented in an orderly manner to the best benefit of the user. Thank you Patrick Kilchermann for an excellent training series! Ive since purchased the new series, Master Handgun Accuracy.",1427500800,2,2300,4.820253164556962

6575238,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Outstanding! Patrick has assembled a very worth-while set of instructional videos. This product is well worth the investment.
Having served in the military for 27 years, including a tour of duty in Iraq, pistol training has been a regular part of my life. This series has been some of the best training I have received yet, largely because Patrick has a unique way of describing key elements and building context. What really makes the series a success is that Patrick has a true passion for what he is doing, helping armed citizens understand the world of concealed carry.

It is too easy to buy a gun, start carrying it, and *think* that we are doing some good by entering the world of armed self-defense. Follow Patricks program, and you will learn there are many new and exciting dimensions to self-defense; you will become profoundly better equipped and skilled with your concealed carry.

It is nearly impossible to find an affordable A-Z guide: here is what you need to know to effectively carry concealed. Patricks series is the tool that addresses this need. I am very thankful for the rich content and thought-provoking aspects of the training.",1427414400,,1154,4.88265306122449
6575239,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This is an excellent program!  I was a state law enforcement officer for 25 years and have had a lot of firearm training. I have been retired from active serviced now for 15 years and have carried my weapons off and on as the perceived need arose.  I have become increasingly alarmed at the level of violence in our society and decided to ""get back into shape"" so to speak and review the basics that I let slip due to non use.  When on active law enforcement duty we were required to qualify on the standard state 50 round firearms course every 60 days.  The material that is presented in this course is spot on with everything I was taught at the State Law Enforcement Academy and through out my career.  However, this material goes even further than my law enforcement training by delving into the mindset and motivation of the criminal and armed citizen, presenting through research on crime statistics, thoughtful analysis of the various weapons available, carry positions and much more.  I have been very impressed with the author, Patrick Kilchermann and his sobering advice regarding concealed carry of a handgun. The material in part one of this course applies to everyone, even if you do not plan to carry concealed.  My wife and I watched this section together in order to review the basics of avoiding confrontation with a violent criminal.  After completing this course I feel motivated to renew my commitment to protect myself, my family, and, if necessary, others around me.  I will begin to put these principles into practice once again.",1427414400,2,1552,4.782771535580524

Pat covers every aspect imaginable and takes the time to fully explain each area covered. Although the material moves along at a slower pace than I would like, you cannot say he glossed over info and left you hanging. My wife and I have truly benefited as concealed permit holders. In addition, Pat is continuing to produce more training videos that is affordable and available. Great job Pat! Keep the good stuff coming!",1427414400,2,579,4.742574257425742
6575241,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I purchased the ""Complete"" package several months ago. I have read a number of the ""good"" reviews here (there are lot of them) and all of the ""bad"" reviews (there are only a few).  I am a 70-year-old retired Army vet with 25 years active duty service and two combat tours in Vietnam.  I got my concealed carry permit probably 10 years ago (carried mostly in my vehicle) and started carrying concealed daily probably 18 months ago.  While some of the negative comments in the reviews are ""style"" issues (repeating things, plain white background, young kid wearing t-shirts, etc.), I found the only real issue I'd be concerned with are the safety issues, and frankly I think Patrick takes great care in emphasizing safety.  Interestingly enough, my carry choice (before I ever heard of Patrick) was the appendix position, and NO ONE in 18 months has noticed I carry unless I tell them.  What I like about Patrick's approach is his emphasis on the mental aspects of carrying -- attitude, awareness, reactiveness -- as well as the physical aspects of type of weapon, holsters, and methods of training and practice.  You absolutely cannot become proficient from ""education"" alone, but you need the education to be able to properly execute what you learn in training and practice.  And for those of us who have been teachers and instructors, repetition is important for learning, whether it's the knowledge part of it or the training (muscle memory) part of it.  So for those who criticize his classroom repetition style, I understand why it's important and useful.  Is it a long program?  Yep, sure is, but I've found it very worthwhile.  Lots of good reminders in it that I really knew but needed reminding of or refreshing.  Patrick also has good advice in how to interact with other citizens as well as law enforcement. His 7-disk package was a worthwhile purchase for me, and I have recommended it to friends.",1427414400,,1908,4.819018404907975
6575242,5,B00MEUZIJC,This is the best training for being prepared to conceal carry that I have come across.  CCW license is so much more than being permitted to strap on a gun and walk around in public.  I particularly like Patrick's candor with what might really happen in a self-defense situation as well as his many facts and statistics regarding gunfights.  This definitely raise my awareness of what I have to be prepared for when carrying concealed.  This series should be a must what to pass CCW licensing.,1427414400,,492,4.686046511627907

6575248,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I've owned and shot firearms for decades.  Not too long ago, I watched the dash cam video from Deputy Kyle Dinkheller's patrol car and had been haunted by the terrible way he had been murdered.  What also bothered me was that, if a law enforcement officer, trained to deal with confrontations involving guns and bad guys, perished the way he did in this shoot out, what chance would I have in a bad situation? The realization dawned on me that, despite my familiarity with firearms, I had zero knowledge on how to use them to defend my life.

Then, an ad crossed my path that directly referenced this incident.  It was from Patrick Kilchermann's Concealed Carry University.  I thought the coincidence too great not to buy the ""Complete Concealed Carry Guide.""  So I did.

As many others have noted, his curriculum is extremely thorough.  It does a great job of showing the complexity of concealed carry and how a responsible citizen needs to think about what it fully entails before just buying a firearm and strapping it on.  Yes, it requires a large time commitment to complete the entire course, but that is exactly what the responsibility demands (and what I, unfortunately, think too many gun owners don't understand or fulfill).  Patrick is very thorough in his discussions and compliments this with good visuals.  The added online bonus materials, completely free, are as good as the course material.",1427414400,,1407,4.869747899159663

I started watching the first disk and realized without taking notes it would be useless so I started taking notes on Disk 2 and than went back and re-watched Disk 1. I now have over 40 pages of typewritten notes to go along with the set The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it needed a workbook to go along with it.

I am actually considering returning it; not because the information is not of value, but because it is so LONG and takes so much time to get through it.  I find much of the information to be redundant.  I believe that this information could be presented differently in a package that is much smaller and takes much less time to digest without losing any of its value.  As an example, I just listened to Patrick, the principle of Concealed Carry University, spend 50 minutes, in a weekly email video/audio that he distributes, explaining that his carry gun of choice was a Glock 19 that he carries in the appendix position with a minimalist holster.  He provides good information; but it could certainly could be presented in a much shorter period of time.  In my opinion, Patrick is knowledgable and very interested in the product he is offering.  It just takes him a lot of time to get throught it.

The education you will get if you apply yourself to the training Patrick offers will truly open your eyes to reality. This DVD set should be REQUIRED WATCHING for anyone who has a permit or is thinking about applying for a permit to carry.
This DVD set is not a small investment to be sure, but you will gain a real wealth of information that was not, and indeed could not, be covered by the few hours initially devoted to getting a license. Lets face it, the instructors don't have the luxury to spend twenty classroom hours talking about the fine points, they have to get the basics over to you fast and move along.
It is up to you to have the desire and interest to further your education in a defense method that could save your life or that of a family member.

My tought is ""is this going to be a waste of my time let alone my money?""  This course wasn't.  One thing I can tell you is that this young man cares about you as an armed citizen.  If you are serious about concealed carry and want someone you can trust - having your best interest at heart - I'm confident that this will become immediately evident when you start to watch the videos.  I'm 63.  I was an army ranger, and i am not unfamiliar with weapons.  I will say that there is always more to learn, and present knowledge to be reinforced.

You must have many tools and preparations before even buying the tool of a handgun. You must have the proper mind set and be prepared to for the mental and physical affects of an armed combat situation. You must then intelligently choose your equipment, the correct gun for you etc.
Finally you MUST learn how to properly use this equipment, not just go out and put holes in a piece of paper, this is serious, this is prepping for combat. If you're not ready for all aspects, then leave the gun in the store.
This course gives it all! These DVD's provide the complete package from proper mind set, selecting the right firearm and associated gear for YOU, and then teaches you what and how to use it correctly. I've learned a lot as a retired police officer of 37 years and before that a marine in the early seventies. This set brought it all together in a logical and complete presentation, not only reminding me of all the things I've learned before, but teaching me a bunch of new things.

After reviewing the entire set, start to finish, we feel like Patrick is a member of the family, and we certainly wish we lived next door to this man.  That said, here's a little information on the set for people new to handguns and/or concealed carry.

The set is VERY complete and VERY well designed.  The chapters are very well organized and the graphics very helpful.  There is JUST ENOUGH repetition in introducing new information/chapters to allow THE VIEWER to transition from one very heavy and important topic to another.  The production quality is great.

Patrick guarantees this product, money back if not satisfied.  We were so completely satisfied that as soon as his Master Handgun Accuracy set came out we picked that up also.  We were very happy with that purchase also.",1425945600,,1097,4.907608695652174

6575263,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I have been a hunter for over 50 years, a federal Firearms Dealer and bullet reloader over 30 years and a high ranking competitive shooter with Safari Club Intl. over 10 years. With what I would call fairly extensive experience with all types of firearms, these videos on self defense and accuracy are the best training I have ever seen. Pat Kilchermann really dots every I and crosses every T on all aspects of handgun mentality, skill and equipment required to be safe, avoid gun fights and stay out of trouble, but if necessary, deliver a swift and accurate defense when all else fails. His program is a necessity for beginners and invaluable for the experienced. I would bet my life on this training, and I say that with all sincerity.
The money you save by not buying the wrong or unnecessary equipment will pay for this program many times over.",1425772800,,850,4.635761589403973

Really, for anyone interested in learning or increasing their knowledge of handling a fire arm you can't do any better than this program. Honest, the things explained and, I want to say taught, but the sincere and thorough way that Mr. Kilchermann presents his knowledge are a blessing to anyone who might be mindful to accept. I personally learned things that only added to my basic thoughts about the art and privilege to own and carry a life protecting instrument. All my prayers and Respect go out to Patrick and his own, much success and safety to him. Anyone will have well spent their money for this product I swear. The information can and probably will save lives, and I think that this is what is the overwhelming jest and concern are. Please know that I can not do justice to try and explain my thankfulness for this blessing I have been able to learn from.

This training series covers background information regarding typical reactions to attacks, the rise in criminal activity in our society and increased risk of personal attack, typical handgun ""myths"", developing a ""warrior mindset"", practical exercises to develop ""muscle memory"" for rapid response, situational awareness, combined with pointers for evaluating concealed carry equipment (holsters, ammo, pistols, belts, etc.).  This program will open your eyes to the seriousness of becoming a trained and responsible ""armed American"".  Your life and / or your family's safety may one day depend on what you will learn from this program!  Don't pass on this fantastic training program.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This course is the next best thing if you do not have the time or money to take a multi day, intensive, hands on course from a highly qualified instructor. Even if you have had thorough hands on training, this course is an excellent way to make sure you continue that training by developing a solid practice regimen. It covers a broad array of topics that most people never consider but that are vital to surviving a self defense situation.",1424908800,,642,4.4491525423728815
6575268,5,B00MEUZIJC,"The complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense taught me the who, why, and when of self defense. It is so important what Patrick explains what to do, but just as important what not to do and how you can acknowledge and avoid a lethal situation.

The training here is never boring and always interesting. You will be wondering what topic will be next; the material topic coverage here was tenfold my expectations
.
Patrick shows you all brands and types of equipment to help you find an economical choice for your best carry method. He has no ego or preference to steer you to any corporate sponsors. Concealed carry handguns need to be practical, comfortable and effective for everyday use, not a trophy case.

When you choose to carry, important training like these DVDs is just as important as gun, holster and ammo selection.

This is a long presentation, but every minute is worth your time. I even listen to the DVDs in the car when I am on a long drive like a talking book to hear it a second time.",1424908800,,1018,4.551912568306011

I also liked Patrick's delivery of the information and it's very clear he is passionate about the subject and a very down to earth and likable person. Thank you Patrick for doing such a great job on putting all this together. You made it look easy and I'm sure it was a big undertaking. I am looking forward to your new three set DVD's on accuracy as well which I already ordered and can't wait to get started before I develop any bad habits.

6575270,5,B00MEUZIJC,"The Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense absolutely lives up to its name. Patrick Kilchermann has done a masterful job in covering every aspect of concealed carry. The DVD's cover every area a person needs to understand the requirements to effectively carry a concealed weapon. l learned that its not enough to just buy a pistol and carry it. The pistol is just a tool and is only effective when the person knows how to use it. Be sure to review the DVD on ""Guns, Ammo and Gear"" before buying a carry pistol. The information in that DVD alone will save you hundreds of dollars and keep you from buying the wrong pistol. I heartily recommend the Complete Concealed Carry Guide. It is well worth the price.",1424736000,,724,4.6640625

6575272,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I started out looking for tips and advise for selecting a good hand gun and holster for conceal carry, so I had concerns about the way it started by talking about the mindset, rather than the equipment. After watching all of the discs it is my opinion that Patric did it the right way and I'm glad I bought this as opposed to something else. He teaches you about mindset then proper training tactics and then educating you how to evaluate equipment and not just a list of what he recommends. That way you can use your unique needs to determine the best equipment for your specific needs. In after thought that is the perfect way to present this level and amount of information. there is a huge amount of things to think about and very much worth watching more than one time. I will re-watch this set from time to time for the rest of my life for a refresher, ( GREAT STUFF PATRIC, THANK YOU ) !!!",1424736000,,896,4.3076923076923075

I will not lie to anyone, so I must state that it started a little slow and it took time to finally watch it with the wife.  I am patient, but she is not.  If for some reason you find yourself thinking on anything else while watching the videos, just rewing it and re-watch it again.

6575274,5,B00MEUZIJC,It's almost hard to not sound like one of the fake reviews that heap a ridicules amount of praise on a mediocre product but here it goes. Unless you've been carrying for years and have been in multiple shootouts there's just no way this series won't provide you with invaluable information and training as to whats really going to happen during an actual self defense situation. The simple factual based approach to concealed carry and the dispersion of myths and popular albeit dangerously far fetched ideas like going out to the range and slowly squeezing out few round at a small circular target that was 25 yards away with a high power handgun like i was doing would make me effective at a situation requiring deadly force. If I had bought this series at the beginning of my concealed carry journey I would not only be a much more effective armed citizen due to the training laid out but also the reality is I would have saved a lot of money by simply not having wasted so much on gear and ammo that wasn't going to be as effective as I thought. If you are serious about concealed carry you really owe it to yourself and to those you may be forced to protect to check out this series. It may seem like a lot for some DVDs but in reality it could actually end up saving you money and when compared to the overall cost of concealed carry equipment it's really not that much...especially when your life and the life of those you care for may depend on it.,1424649600,3,1456,4.396296296296296
6575275,5,B00MEUZIJC,"As someone just starting out with concealed carry, this series was an excellent way for me to learn about practically everything involved with it and how to avoid common pitfalls.  The modules are arranged in an excellent order, with theory and mindset coming first and equipment being last. Carrying concealed is a HUGE responsibility and Patrick explains it all in a way that everyone from the seasoned professional to the beginner can understand. I have learned so much from ONE source and look forward to more superb training from Patrick and company.",1424649600,,555,5.032608695652174

The only negative I have for this course is the DVD's are long.  Patrick could have easily covered the information in half as many DVD's.",1424649600,,415,5.0588235294117645
6575277,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I'm a new shooter. . . .my bro-in-law has a few really nice weapons, which, like Patrick said, attracted my interest initially by their very LOOKS.  Luckily, I heard Patrick say that we must approach CC with a more business-like concept.  I thank you so much for the opportunity to learn the RIGHT way before ""polluting"" my technique by watching the junk on the various video services online.  Now when I watch a police program on TV, I see immediately the lack of training that the ACTORS who play police roles, and the fact that they ACT with words and body, not with all of the muscle memory techniques taught by Patrick.  Thank you for this outstanding program.  I pray I'll never have to use the training in a real combat situation, but for a new guy into firearms, I am extremely interested in learning it the right way.

I highly recommend it for three reasons. Kilcherman is highly qualified. The series is very thorough. You can go back and review sections as you work through your training.

I do recommend you consider taking notes as you view it. There is a lot of info here and having a note to refer to is helpful. Watch the series and you won't regret the time spent.",1424563200,,635,4.283333333333333

This class shows how to stay out of trouble ,how to choose the right equiptment ,how to use it properly, and how to be the citizen we all wish to be. The reason there are so many DVDs is because MOST concealed carry citizens are unaware of the many pitfalls and the HUGE
responsibility it is. If you only buy one thing this year don't let it be a gun or ammo, you will save yourself time and money with these discs. If not for you, then for the loved ones you protect. Thank you CCU!!!!!!",1424476800,,674,4.31496062992126
6575286,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was mugged once by three individuals. Even though two of them went to the hospital I was beat up pretty bad and went also. I vowed that would never happen again and got a concealed carry permit and started to carry my Beretta M9, a weapon that I was familiar with from 24 years military service. Several months ago I saw the ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self Defense"". I ordered it because, even though I was now armed, something still didn't feel right.
When I started watching, I couldn't put it down. I watched all 7 CD's in 2 days. The CD's showed me that my mindset was wrong, my Skills were lacking, and my equipment wasn't as effective as it could and should be. But not just showing me what was wrong it gave me tools to get my head prepared for what may happen. Tools to improve my skills and how to pick equipment that fulfilled MY needs.
Now I may not be where I need to be but I am getting there because I have a guide that I can follow and TRUST. My head is prepared for what I hope I never need but I may. my Skill with a weapon that I thought I was proficient at has improved ten fold and I can count on my gear working properly if the need should ever present itself.",1424476800,,1222,4.138655462184874

Re-viewing it is just as enjoyable and applying the methods described is worth the additional time.  It is like a good book, you want to view it again and again.  Raved about it to my brother, who them purchased it and he is raving about it.  My accuracy went up dramatically, I learned more about the responsibility of carrying concealed, and wish that all the anti-gun people would view it to see how important it is to honor the second amendment.  I recommend this to everyone who owns a firearm, just not to those who own firearms and never carry concealed.  I've owned firearms for 60 years and wish this had been available when I first started.  Everyone considering purchasing a firearm and/or carrying concealed should view this set and the second set on accuracy.  I give it the highest rating there is.

I am a career-long shooter and evolved from Army combatant to law enforcement.  I am grateful for the reminders but I also find many of the lessons/tips useful as I teach younger shooters how to correctly think, act and fight ... when it matters most.

We sold our farm a few years ago and move into town and decided we wanted to join a gun club so we had a place to shot year round. We also decided to get training on self defence and concealed carry. We began with some courses by local trainers and shot at least every other week. I saw Patrick's advertisement and ordered the DVDs and was very impressed, he really helped us under stand the mental part of hand gun self defence as well as better marksmen ship. There are many myth out there and opionions that we didn't agree with, Patrick helped us understand the mindset we need to have either in the home or out side the home plus the responsibility we have as gun owners, especially if we are going to carry. We believe these DVDs would be good for beginners or seasoned shooters. I discuss many of the things I have learned with others that talk about caring and using a gun in self defence, there are a lot of people out there that need to be educated on everything from proper ways to handle a gun to the mindset you need to have if you are going to have a gun for self defence and especially the muscle memory you will need to have if there ever becomes a time you have to use deadly force.

We also had no knowledge of what Mind Set was and how valuable to practice and to accuracy it was.

6575309,5,B00MEUZIJC,"An excellent program of training for beginners and advance warriors alike. Even if you are not a conceal carry person, you still can learn a great deal from the training, starting from building a foundation to the types of weapons to carry. Real scenarios give you true meaning of the possibilities that can happen in when things go down and you have to react or not. The Concealed Carry University is changing the game of life for the better, to protect you from danger, and danger is around the corner almost everywhere we live. Crime and terrorism is not going away, and depending on someone else (military or police) might not be there in time when you need them the most.
I would highly suggest buying this product because it will save you countless hours and money if you were to train at a shooting range, can cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Try the product first, nothing to lose, 100% money back guarantee. I think you will keep it for good training, reference, and self-defense.

I have not felt completely proficient or knowledgeable in carrying,  I have worked to educate myself and train regularly with my weapon(s) since I obtained my license.  Even with this work, I am not satisfied with my level of capability or preparedness.

This program is an outstanding resource.  The training and information Pat provides is 100% real world applicable.  I enjoyed the design of the course and presentation style.  He comes across as a regular guy.  His passion for the subject is easily apparent as you go through the discs.

He presents a lot of information on each topic but I always found it interesting and useful. His course should be required viewing for any concealed permit holder who wants to be competent. I took the required two hours of instruction to get the license but clearly after seeing this course I recognize how little prepared I was for a real life self defense situation. While there are many videos online for free, this course is well worth the money because so many tips in it might save your life or that of a family member.",1423699200,,683,4.652892561983471
6575316,5,B00MEUZIJC,"We purchased this program late last year and watched all of it, most of it a couple of times.  It is very informative and Patrick does an exceptional job of thoroughly covering all aspects from the mindset required to the gear he recommends.  My wife and I have shot together for over 30 years and are both proficient with our weapons.  We have held our permits for several years and have attended several concealed carry classes.  Although the classes were very good, they just don't compare and didn't provide the in-depth information that this program does.

As with anything in life, ""if your mind is not in it"" you will not be as successful as you would ""if your mind is in it""  The mindset DVDs are excellent and provide valuable information that can prepare you to protect you and your family whether you decide to carry concealed or not.

Most folks I am acquainted with have never shot a handgun while moving, or shot at a moving target.  These videos describe the importance of being able to move and shoot and how practice plays an important part of developing muscle memory and the importance of muscle memory.

This is a great program and I would recommend it to anyone who is currently carrying concealed or anyone who is considering carrying a concealed weapon.  You will benefit from this program even if you chose not to carry.

Throughout the program, Patrick states that if you have questions, you may contact him at his email address.  I will say he did respond to our email in a very reasonable time frame",1423267200,,1526,4.611111111111111

How I wish these lessons were available back when I first began to carry.  The research, time and effort you put into each chapter certainly shows and I enjoyed watching every minute of it.  Great for the beginner and experienced CCW person as well.  Looking forward to watching your next instructional video on effective shooting!

I thought I knew enough about protection to defend myself and my family.  After viewing the video series, I confess that I was ignorant in many areas.  I believe this set will help you improve your knowledge and confidence in concealed carry.

I suggest you read the one star review, and the follow-up comments for complete awareness.  I might not have purchased this set had I read that review first.  I'm glad I didn't read it.  An often quoted phrase ""when danger is seconds away, help is only minutes away"" makes me glad I bought the set.  It is well worth the price.  It is a reference tool that will open your eyes to potential deficiencies in your carry routine.",1421798400,,819,4.5479452054794525

We (my husband and I) have been concealed carry for a number Of years and needed this training to become confident that we will be ready to defend ourselves and our loved ones.  Patrick is very thorough and informative.  He uses language a normal person can understand and doesn't make you feel inadequate even though you are  not experienced in combative situations.  He also makes you realize it's your job to be alert and able to defend yourself.  I highly recommend watching his DVDs and listening to his lectures.,1421452800,2,586,4.696078431372549

I still give it a 5 because it is packed full of extremely useful material that will make you more educated that 99% of people interested in handguns.

I just finished the 20hrs of DVD's and feel like I know what I need in a self defense class. I had no idea that  standing  in one spot and shooting targets was teaching me a bad habits but the DVDs make a lot of sense. I highly recommend BEFORE  any one takes a gun class or purchases a hand gun.,1420329600,,402,3.8780487804878048
6575326,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I'm currently viewing this program for the second time for a couple of reasons. First, it contains such a plethora of info that a person like myself who is relatively new to carrying probably would have never thought of on their own. Secondly, like a great book that you can't put down I found it riveting. Patrick's down to earth, common sense approach allows anyone to increase their knowledge and improve their skills as well as raise their level of confidence. I would recommend this guide to anyone who owns or is thinking of owning a gun for defensive purposes.
OK, one more reason: I'm 63 years old, and my brain just doesn't retain info like it used to. I have no doubt that over the next year or so I'll be going over the program at least a couple more times. Not a problem. That's how easy it is to watch.

Then how to avoid a gunfight altogether.  Then the skills necessary in a gunfight.  Finally we learn about the equipment we may need and the proper way to take care of that equipment.  In short, this was a tremendous program that made me feel confident, in every respect, with carrying a concealed weapon.

My wife and I watched it together (my second time through) and it has been worth its weight at twice the price.  I ""like"" Patrick, his approach to teaching and his reasoning for everything he shares with us.  That said, Patrick, I highly recommend you stay out of the ""Convincing the Souse"" business!!!  While it was only 5 minutes out of 20 hours, (1) It was clearly directed toward the ""wife"" spouse, (2) incredibly condescending/pedantic, and (3)  it doesn't meet your standards for good advice and mostly doesn't belong anywhere in this set of videos.  My Wife and I laughed and laughed at how uncomfortable you were with the topic and how terrible the advice was on how to treat and what to say to your wife!!!  My wife bet me $1000 dollars you never asked your wife to help, review or edit that section.  It was pretty funny though, I admit.

Again, some of the best money we've spent concerning our training.  I am only sad we can't figure out where we can go to do any of the live fire exercises you recommend as basic required work.  Our indoor range won't let us, and I don't feel like I know where I can go into the woods West of Colorado Springs and shoot legally.  Maybe since you lived here you can send a recommendation?

We both feel the series gave us a better perspective on carrying and more self confidence if the need arrived to use our gun. The series covers every aspect from mind set to actual use.

6575332,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I have been a shooter and firearm enthusiast for over forty years participating in competitive shoots and hunting. Having lived in several states across the country, I have also carried concealed for many years. This program is THE BEST concealed carry trainer in the market. Most of the concealed carry classes given today lack real world experience and hands on firearm control. More importantly, the classes lack the sophistication required to mentally prepare someone for an armed conflict with a bad guy. Patrick Kilcherman prepares the individual who carries a concealed firearm to anticipate surroundings and attempt to eliminate a situation before it occurs. The theme of the program encourages the forward operator to avoid a gunfight if at all possible.....even to flee the scene if necessary. There is no bravado rhetoric; instead, there is carefully researched information presented by a fantastic speaker (Patrick). This course should be required for anyone considering concealed carry even if you have taken one of the lackluster classes given today to qualify for CCP. Do your self  a favor and get this great program. you won't regret it!",1419552000,,1154,5.271739130434782

6575334,5,B00MEUZIJC,"As a CCW holder for Utah, Arizona, Florida, and (finally) Illinois, with over 200 hours of tactical pistol training, it is a little scary to think that there are people carrying a hand gun that have had no more training than you get by taking the basic course necessary to obtain a CCW license.  Anyone who plans to carry a firearm would be well advised to buy this DVD set, as the first step to what is needed to have the confidence to carry concealed.  The second is to hopefully find a training facility that allows the type of effective training advocated in the DVD set.  Most static gun ranges do not let you even wear a holster, much less draw from it, concealed, and put multiple, quick shots on target, move off the X, engage multiple targets, and such other tactics needed to stay alive in a gun fight.  I am lucky enough to be under two hours from such a facility, where I have obtained much of my training.  It is very helpful to have the sort of information in this set, recognizing (and avoiding) the Monkey Dance, changing the OODO Loop of an attacker, recognizing the different types of attackers, particularly in a home invasion situation (one actually wants to hurt or kill you.)  Knowledge is power.  While I hesitate to say that this set should be mandated by any State to get a CCW license, it certainly would be a very good idea that every new CCW licensee buy it and then train accordingly.

My point by giving that back ground is that I found this information still very helpful, I've been in search of so much of the material provided.  I have always found my attention grabbed by any violence I encounter, not to say that it draws me necessarily, but it immediately triggers my mind.  I understand about myself, that if I can help, I will.  I have to.  However that could mean trouble, if you don't know how to do it smartly.

The mandatory class taught basic gun law and shoot don't shoot scenarios, this video series covered how to get out of a violent confrontation, how to properly train for combat shooting, selecting the best equipment, how to carry every day and much more.  I learned so much from this series and was a little surprised that I did, because I have been proficient in handgun shooting for 36 years. I can't praise this program enough. Well worth every penny.

6575352,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This collection of DVD's is a must have item if your intentions are on carrying your weapon in a concealed manner. It is very long and very informative, it not only breaks down the mindset of being that warrior you must be to carry concealed, but it gives you training, as well as, gear. Patrick Kilchermann is a good spokesperson to represent the seriousness of conceal carry and helps you prepare for your journey and change of life which happens the moment you chose to go conceal carry for the safety for  you, your family, and the public to ""stop the threat"", which I hope you never have to use but you will be more prepared if you have to. He really brings out the seriousness of gun safety and carry concealed rules. He also the founder of Conceal Carry University (CONCEALED CARRY UNIVERSITY.ORG), which also offers you a weekly radio broadcast through your email address. Just got the video training which comes with 7 seven DVD'S for the conceal carry platform, a must have!",1417305600,,984,4.622857142857143
6575353,5,B00MEUZIJC,Do not carry concealed until you have watched this DVD set!  It opens your eyes and prepares you. Excellent!!!!,1417219200,,111,4.842105263157895
6575354,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am among those that felt I was well prepared to carry concealed, took excellent training, was in the military, went to the range on a regular basis, even became involved in and enjoyed shooting IDPA, Steel and some USPSA. Pretty well prepared I thought. Bring on this DVD set by Concealed Carry University - MANY eye openers and huh moments. Does the guy (Patrick) get repetitive sometimes and is there stuff you can breeze through depending on your level ? Yep, but overall you are going to feel this is a great addition to your knowledge base AND you can always go back and review things that you have become fuzzy on. This is not one of those purchases I have had second thoughts on as I like it enough to bother writing a review. As a great resource for beginner to expert, will you agree 100% with all he has to say? Probably not, but that is true anytime anyone tries to make a ""Complete Guide"". Overall I believe you will not be disappointed.",1417219200,,951,4.409090909090909
6575355,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am not even sure where I learned about this DVD set.  I was a member of the U. S. Conceal Carry Association and I might have seen it advertised there.  Anyone who is seriously considering conceal carry needs to see the extremely valuable information Patrick has put into these videos.  I found the content to be very valuable, and prepares you mentally to avoid many common conceal carry mistakes.  The subject matter covers so many important issues, and many are potentially life-saving.  The most important thing in the course is how to avoid ever having to use your weapon.  But he also goes through an extremely well thought out training program to prepare you for the best possible chance of surviving an unavoidable use of force situation.

He also gives you the best, most complete advice ever on choosing a gun and holster set-up.  Like many people I had larger pistols I loved to shoot, but felt a small Ruger LCP was the easiest way to pocket carry.  Boy does Patrick explain why there are so many other considerations and situations where another gun would have been a live-saving choice.  For example.  Multiple armed attackers, 5 bullets in an LCP and 70% of shots fired will miss.  Not to mention the lack of a ""combat caliber bullet"".  With the right gun and holster, it is so comfortable, and faster to deploy in a critical situation.

If you ever have to use your Conceal Carry weapon, you might die, you might kill an innocent bystander and for sure you will be spending tens of thousands on legal issues.  Plus you might go to jail.  So given all that downside, the price of this course is a bargain and could save your life and your family members lives, or avoid life of legal hell or even a life in jail.  Even if you are only considering getting a CCL, you will make much better choices if you go through this 30 hour course.  It is 100 times more valuable than the CCL mandatory 8 hour class you will most likely have to attend.

Lastly, I would like to also advise individuals who are preparing themselves to protect their life, home and family with a gun, to consider traveling to a city with a video training simulator, like the Gander Mountain Academy operations in about 10 cities.  One or two hours of shooting their laser pistols will dramatically improve your ability to hit a rapidly moving threat target.  I'm 65 and have been shooting at stationary paper targets for 50 years.  I learned more in 2 hours of simulator training and dramatically improved my speed and accuracy while shooting at video threats, charging you with a knife or even multiple attackers come at you in a dark parking garage.  After experiencing that ""four armed attacker scenario"" video in a parking structure, with surprise attackers jumping up behind you in the 300 degree video simulation, you will see how a 5 shot gun means you are going to die.  These simulators cost only about 15 to 30 bucks for 30 minutes or more.  You shoot hundreds of times, and the fees are less than the cost of the real ammo you would be using and your thumbs won't be bleeding from reloading magazines so many times.  Check out the YouTube videos on the Gander Mountain Academy. Simulator Training is a very valuable tool for anyone considering conceal carry or defending your family from a home invasion by multiple attackers.

Great course.  Thanks Patrick for putting it out, I'm sure it was a ton of work.  Great Job.  Buyers you won't be sorry.",1416960000,7,3442,4.6042692939244665

6575364,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am 57 years old, have been shooting nearly my entire life and have been carrying concealed for almost as long as it has been available in my home state.  As a result, I thought that I had acquired a considerable amount of knowledge in this field.  Wow!  Was I ever in for an awakening.  After completing this course the first time (I plan on revisiting it often), I came away with the cold, hard realization that most, if not all, mandated concealed-carry courses leave the student/applicant with just enough information to make them dangerous, both to themselves and those around them.  The down-to-earth, common sense material in this program will turn that around by not only making you a safer, more effective and responsible citizen in our society, but give you the tools to greatly increase your odds of both avoiding as well as surviving a lethal-force situation, including the inevitable legal aftermath.  This program is information-intensive, but please do not let that discourage you in any way.  The instructor goes to great lengths to offer suggestions on absorbing this information so it matches your particular learning curve.  And don't fall victim to the old adage that says, ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks.""  This program focuses heavily on deeply engraining specific lifesaving ""tools"" that can be recalled, almost without thought, for the rest of your life with very little maintenance required to keep them sharp.  If you are serious about concealed carry and those who depend on you, then this program will be, hands down, the most valuable piece of concealed carry gear you will ever own.  I can almost guarantee that, in addition making you more effective, it will change your life, for the better!",1416096000,,1732,4.937931034482759

But recommendations on the tools is only one third of the course, and it is the last third, after covering your mindset, and skills training.  One part that I really appreciated was the commentary on several real-live videos on how to and how not to handle yourself in a real self-defense situation.

Overall, this course was very thoughtfully and thoroughly done.  A few descriptive terms come to mind:  intense, gripping, informative, respectful, inspiring.  Will watch it again with my wife after my grown kids all get a chance to see it.",1416009600,,778,4.930769230769231

I was a rifle, pistol, and a hand to hand combat instructor in the Marine Corps, and a second degree black belt in Karate with years of teaching experience at my own school.  Needless to say, I was sure I knew a lot about self defense, until I took this course.  It has educated me more than I can say and it was the best money I have ever spent, related to protecting my family and myself.

They did a great job with this course and they can be very proud of the way they presented it.  This has changed my way of thinking about how to properly defend my family and myself.

This Course I have taken to finally help with my ""Mind Set"" to carry all the time, I have been around fire arms all my life, However, having one on my person all the time was something that I later in life seen the need for, As most armed citizens find that carrying is somewhat challenging to say the least which results in a part time thing and I have witnessed the need to many times to be ready at any given moment. This Course has helped me in so many ways to develop my carry habits. Develop my body, Mind and Brain to accept it.

The training sections I really enjoyed, I have some old habits to break and this section shows what I was doing wrong. I have Retrained My Brain to get rid of the bad habits and refocus on the proper form and movement during an attack. A lot to think about when you have no time to think. It should be natural, second nature so to speak.

I would recommend this Course Guide to anyone needing some answers. there are many questions that Patrick covers that you just don't get on You Tube or in books.

Thanks Patrick for your hard work on this course, Great Job !!

6575377,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Like anyone reading these testimonials or looking to buy Patrick's DVD Training, I have a love guns and always have! I also like my life and the lives of my family and intend to protect them until my last breath. I consider myself an ordinary 63 year old disabled man who doesn't look for trouble but over the years I have been in some vulnerable situations where no other alternative to survive was to fight! I have been through self defense training and learned the best battle where everybody wins is to stand down, talk it out or as the experts say diffuse the situation. So far that has worked for me but now, with my disabilities, I feel less confident with my ability to protect myself and my family. I've always owned a self defense gun but never carried concealed until about a year ago. I have ordered and completed two other self defense video training courses, prior to purchasing Patrick's DVD and obtained a lot of knowledge from both of them. I'll say this, the combat veteran trainers definitely bring a sense of hardcore but practical training that is definitely useful in self defense situations! I also feel any training an armed citizen takes and applies to their own arsenal is helpful. For me, Patrick's training helped me to refocus on my approach to knowing and handling my weapon and also how to prepare mentally and physically if and when that bad situation presents itself.

If you are worried about value for the money...don't.  You will get many times what you will pay for this set back just in the fact that you will make less gear mistakes.  The one DVD covering Gun, Ammo and Gear will save you many times over the price of this set.  But that is just a small part and not the main reason you should buy this set.  If you are going to carry a gun, this program will build your understanding of everything related to that responsibility up from the ground up in a way that will make the difference in a life and death situation.  The foundation you will build from the learning shared in this video set would require years of experience to gain on your own.  If you received this training in a series of highly advanced training courses you would pay thousands of dollars and I would dare say still not have as complete an understanding as you will gain from the exceptionally produced and delivered series. Trust me, I have been carrying a gun professionally and for personal protection for more than 30 years. I have been fortunate to have received some of the best training money can buy, and still I learned a lot for this series.  Even if you have had lots of training, you will benefit from this series.  This series will also go a long way to correcting bad training you may have received in the past.  If you are just starting to think about carrying a gun or are new to the experience then you MUST OWN and WATCH this series. The knowledge and training you need to be a well trained and well advised citizen who carries a hand gun is within your reach and more affordable than ever possible, as a result of this series.  I give this series my highest recommendation.  If you have a choice to buy your first gun or buy this series you should buy this series FIRST.  If you already own many firearms you should buy this series before you buy your next firearm.  If will make each gun you already own many times more valuable.  I congratulate Patrick for developing what is truly a ""Complete"" and ""Comprehensive"" Guide to Concealed Carry.  I would go so far as to rename the series the ""Definitive"" Guide..but I am sure Patrick is too humble to make that claim for himself and this product.  The quality to instruction is out of this world made better only by the quality of the instructor.  You will understand when you buy this product what I mean by that last comment.

But, actually, it's more than a little confusing in that everyone seems to hype their own personal opinion or preference without a lot of hard facts or evidence to back it up.  NOT HERE.  Patrick presents information in an uncluttered, authoritative manner.  Every piece of folklore, advice and ""conventional wisdom"" is dissected and evaluated with one common denominator . . . how does it stack up to REAL WORLD self-defense case studies.

Besides helping someone to understand options for effective firearms, calibers and accessories, he uses authoritative resources to explain the most effective means of AVOIDING armed conflict.  There is really so much in this 7 disc set that it is hard to describe it accurately.

Let me just say that if a person is TRULY interested in becoming effective and knowledgeable in carrying a concealed weapon, get this program.  You will NOT be disappointed.",1415577600,,1119,5.177777777777778

Although this program is tailored towards cc, so much of the information applies to using a handgun in ANY situation.

6575392,5,B00MEUZIJC,"The reviews on this program are spot on.  The ""Concealed Carry Guide"" box-set is the best researched, most relevant and most complete training program I have ever owned.  Patrick utilizes the tried and true approach of teaching:  ""Tell them what you're going to tell them; tell them; then tell them what you told them.""  Thus, both major points and more subtle points are easily assimilated.  The program is beneficial to shooters of all skill levels and I would encourage all persons who intend to carry concealed to watch the program before buying any gear.  You'll be taught how to properly evaluate firearms, ammo,
holsters, etc.. to serve YOUR needs, without letting marketing professionals unduly influence your decisions.  I was about ready to put my Glock 23 in the safe and buy a smaller, lighter weight, more easily concealable pistol, but saw this program in time.  I now realize that the mag capacity of the pistol I planned to buy is not sufficient for multiple threats, so I still carry the Glock.  This one bit of advice saved me over $ 650 (considering the price of the new pistol, spare mags and a holster).  Thus,  I have already realized a good return on my investment in the program.  Being proficient as a responsible armed citizen will require a mind-set different from military or civilian target shooting.  To that end, Patrick's program gives you the foundational skill set and demonstrates multiple drills to sharpen your skills.  I recommend the program without hesitation, and encourage all students to tune in for the weekly ""Forward Operator Broadcasts.",1415318400,,1583,4.969581749049429
6575393,5,B00MEUZIJC,This is one the best presentations I have seen in a long time. It is well worth the investment of time and money to increase your knowledge of what it means to conceal carry.

6575397,5,B00MEUZIJC,"All I can say is WOW.  The material presented in this course is invaluable.  If a person had to do all the research on his own, very few people would have the extensive knowledge to make them a responsible and SAFE concealed carrier.  I highly recommend this course to anyone, regardless of past experience, who is planning to carry for defensive purposes.  This is an A to Z presentation and helps the complete novice as well as a seasoned veteran.  It even goes into the different types of assaults you could encounter.  It explains what you need to know to make an informed decision as to what weapon you will use as a carry weapon.  It even tells you why and how ammunition differs from different manufacturers and how to get good ones.  The best part is that you can actually communicate with Patrick (the instructor and founder of Concealed Carry University) and he will actually respond!!  He has just begun a weekly broadcast (free) over the internet that keeps you updated and motivated to be a responsible armed citizen.

6575399,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Best purchase decision I ever made.  Growing up in Texas I've been around and owned guns for hunting and target shooting since I was a young kid in the 60's.  Just recently decided to carry a gun for personal defense and I wish I'd bought this video first.  I read all I could on-line and talked to LEOs, ICE, and BP Agents that carry both on and off duty.  Thought I had a good handle on what I needed...wrong!  I wasted my time and money...I bought 3 guns and at least a dozen holsters before I found a combination that worked for me comfortably,  only to discover that I should have bought a gun with less flashy good-looks and more ammo capacity.  I viewed the entire DVD set and watched a few over again before starting my training and I hope to complete this fall.  I'm overweight and have some age related disabilities, bad knees, hip replacement, bad vision, and I read reviews by older folks that said they did not benefit much from the course because they were not physically able.  I take the glass half-full view, no I cant do all the physically demanding training exercises, but I try to do as many as possible and I delete those I cant SAFELY execute.  Just knowing what my attacker is likely to do, and what I can and can not do to counter the threat, escape, or fight...all makes this instruction well worth the price.  Patrick Kilchermann is an excellent instructor and he really hit a home run with this DVD training course.  Buy it and I'm sure you'll agree",1415145600,,1476,4.405904059040591

6575405,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Excellent video training.  I appreciate the fact Patrick goes thru the scenarios one might encounter, then based on reality, moves into the selection of a proper handgun for your particular use and application.  People's needs and situations vary, people themselves vary in size and shape, and not all handguns will suit every situation or person.

The information is provided in an easy to follow, friendly style, and not by some macho-military training by a self anointed expert.

Importantly as I stated in the first paragraph, the course covers the intended use and then helps in selection of a suitable handgun.  That in itself is worth the cost of the program if it prevent one from purchasing a handgun, and finding out it is not what might be the 'best' for your situation.  BIG money to be saved in that advice alone.

The program spends a considerable amount of time discussing the aftermaths of incidences, and how best to handle communications with 911 operators and law enforcement after the fact.  This is a VERY important aspect of concealed carry that is not well covered in most courses.

I recommend this to my CC friends, and am now part way through my second viewing of the entire video set.",1415059200,,1211,4.811594202898551

Patrick has done a fantastic job of distilling a large amount of important information into a reasonable time period.  He has taken a lot of research and compacted it into 20 hours of quality training.  I found his technique of not looking at the camera odd at first but quickly became accustomed to it and found it natural after a short time.  I believe he provides some incredibly valuable information that you will never get in the average concealed carry class.  He covers many more subjects and goes into greater detail on each subject.  He also suggests important additional resources like books and websites that I read and visited and found very interesting and helpful.  As a matter of fact, those books recommend even more good books if you really want to master the craft and understand the legal and mental aspects of being an armed citizen.  This DVD set is definitely worth the small dollar investment as well as the substantial time investment if you want to be a responsible armed American.",1415059200,,1094,4.756613756613756

Conceal carry, (CC) is a very serious matter.  My life and the lives of those around me will be greatly affected by my response to a life threatening event, (God forbid).
CC should not be a hobby for me, but a life style.  I'm not saying I need to obsess over CC, but I do need to be responsible by learning and practicing as much as I can for my sake and for the sake of those around me.
The more I learn, the more I realize I don't know.  This guide takes a very complex subject and breaks in into manageable chunks that can be reviewed at any time very easily.
Patrick is a very sincere and truly believes in what he teaches.  He also checks his ego at the door.

You made my day, with my desire to carry, knowing that I had the mental basics that all persons should know prior to purchasing and carrying a firearm for personal protection.  The beauty part is that I can go back and review whenever I feel the need to.  You have delivered a product that is absolutely outstanding and covers the entire basics for concealed carry.

Mr. Kilchermann's ability in addressing the mindset and mental aspects of concealed carry self defense has dramatically increased my safety, without even having been to the range yet.  I have, and continue to review the DVDs regularly and plan on incorporation the hands on portion in the near future.  My most important takeaway so far is the fact that ""most threats I'll face do not call for lethal force. But for the ones that do, lethal force is the only option"", and more importantly how to know the difference. This training is solid gold.",1414972800,,713,4.590551181102362

I though that I was prepared for anything. I was completely wrong. After completing this training I realized that I have never been truly prepared for most situations. Thanks to this guide I now understand the truth. I am still not totally prepared, but I now have the tools to become better prepared. With continued training, using the concepts I have learned throughout this guide, I know I will become the warrior and protector that I was meant to be. The information in this box set is extremely detailed and informative. Anyone who wants to be educated in effective self defense can benefit from this guide no matter your level of experience.

As a side note, I have emailed the instructor/author of this guide with a few questions. I was totally surprised when he actually responded to my questions himself.

They have changed the way I view my conceal carry in a very important and beneficial manner. These DVDs should be the standard for all concealed carry courses.  I feel better about carrying, because I feel better prepared, especially mentally. I have only completed through disk #6, but I now have a much better perspective of the total picture that an armed citizen must consider and factor into everyday life.

I have also gained a better perspective on the reality of a violent encounter and what actions I must take to avoid, avoiding is what I prefer to do. But at the same time I refuse to be a Victim and if conditions require, I will win the gun fight. It has shown me the gaps in my training and how to close them.

I thank the creators of this set very much, I am glad that I took the chance to buy and view these DVDs; it has been a great decision! I am a better protector of my family after watching these DVD's and learning and acting from them.

My mind set has changed to the warrior. I also have the confidence now to act in the correct way in many different situations.

In some ways it might seem a bit boring , a lot of lecture and very little video background change.. the greatest value  was the data output.
I might not agree totally with all he said but the value was golden.  Starting with attitude and going through practical realistic concerns on how one needs to prepare, practice and contually work to the end of being a better,smarter CCW carrier cannot be faulted.  I worked years ago carrying answering breakin calls for a security co.  I wish I knew then what Patrick has now provided.

If you are thinking of carrying concealed, but have doubts like I did...This program is what you are looking for. We are very fortunate that Patrick invested the time to organize this system.  If more Americans watch this and feel more comfortable being wolfs among the civilian population, we will be able to to fight back as a country.  There is no proof that he ever said this, but even still, it used to be valid in my opinion. Supposedly, General Isoroku Yamamoto said, You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.  Even if he didn't say that or if there was no written proof it was said, it meant something to me when I reflected our history during a time of desperation regarding terrorism in this country.  We need to be that country again, in my opinion.  Regardless of what our government does behind our backs, we need to be able to defend ourselves in our homeland...Even if the reason our enemy is here, is a reason we as citizens didn't provoke.  This program isn't just handgun training.  It is an eye opening perception that every human being should have.  This world is a crazy place.  Training ourselves to be be more aware of this, is much more than handgun training.  After watching this program I felt that even if I didn't have my gun on me, I was still a sheep dog.  I actively remain in condition Yellow with or without my gun.  It is said that if you live in fear of what could happen, you can almost draw that negative energy toward yourself.  Staying alert to the threats of this crazy place, is not always being in fear of what can happen, but rather not being naive to reality.  With this ""warrior mindset"", I don't fear the people who can make decisions that can take away my freedom or life catching me off guard.  Instead, I empower myself with the thought that I will not let anyone take my freedom or life.",1411516800,12,2494,4.487804878048781
6575438,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Great stuff!  If you had even a single question that you would have otherwise gone to a friend with, or someone you consider to have excellent knowledge of for Concealed Carry issues/concerns/tactics or legal elements, this is a far better course of action to take.  I've played competitive golf in years past and was and ok player.  That was enough for dozens of friends, family and strangers to ask for advice on getting started in the game or wanting to discuss something of a more advanced nature.  I was consistent over those 40 years or so of  telling them that they should go see a ""Professional"" or several until one can be found that makes you comfortable and have that first dialogue with them.  From there, move through the beginning basics in a methodical, useful approach.  Knowing that almost all golf professionals are trained up to provide that type of service and support, it was the best advice I could offer--a close second was the advice I decided not to give, I still have friends and family and no stranger has stalked me in all those years because I gave them a bad ""teach"".  This DVD set from Patrick is about as good as it gets.  While I was engaged in navigating through the discs, I was also taking a hands on training given my an instructor who I have been to the range with.  The instructor is my friend and I can only say his heart is in the right place for trying to get folks like me who want to carry concealed more traction with the knowledge needed.  However, at the risk of having to take my instructor to lunch to make up for any discontent he might feel if he were to come across this review, I can confidently report to the readers that this DVD training set is far and away hands above all other methods of training you'll come by that will allow you to gain knowledge right from your couch or desk.  I wish I would have had this series while i was still in the workforce traveling from place to place, it would have been a nice travel companion for me.  Reading my bible did ok to though too!:).  Don't hestiate to make the purchase, this is the real deal and will take you further down that CCW path in a handful of hours than other traditional train-ups would get you in years.  Thanks Patrick, well done brother!  BTW, I paid $120.00 for the on-hands training.  The cost comparison between the DVD set and the training I took cannot be made in a reasonable manner.  However, I would venture to say that the $120.00 I spent for on-hands training was equal to about a half of one disc!  Just saying...",1409529600,9,2543,4.406852248394005

It not only expanded the knowledge we got from the permit class, it helped in deciding on gear best suited for my wife and I. The best way to buy affordable.

Nice packaging, a few spiffy animated opening and closes with a thumping soundtrack.  The content? Warmed over oatmeal gleaned from several other reputable concealed carry instructors served up by an unshaven, t-shirted young man droning on for hours, lecturing in front of a plain, white background. Occasionally there is a cut away to actual shooting on the ""range"". Not a real range, mind you, but a sand pit in the countryside somewhere. And it is pretty much the same thing over and over. While his message is accurate, he repeats himself time and time again... and not to make a point but because he doesn't remember that he already covered the topic. His other favorite approach is to mention a subject and then say ""and we'll come back to  that in a minute..."" which, of course he fails to do.

Do a Google search on the author and you will find that he has had somewhat checkered past within the firearms training industry and the ""home remedy for carpal tunnel syndrome"" business as well. On his ""Concealed Carry University"" website, he does not boast or claim any training or qualifications other than he wants to ""serve"" Americans by teaching his unique understanding of Concealed Carry. Most instructors claim all sorts of qualifications, as minute as they may be; the fact that he doesn't is a red flag to me.

I suspect that this video would provide them with far more useful and accurate information than they received from whatever sources they are using.

I can't add anything to what other reviewers have said. This is a fantastic package and I would not hesitate to purchase it if I had it to do over again.

I could go on and on, but surely will not do it justice, so i will just say If you want to carry, or you already do carry concealed, you owe it to yourself to watch these videos for yourself.

He spends a lot of time on how to stay in the safe zone, how to recognize danger, and how to avoid it.  He also calls out the most effective ways to deal with it when it is unavoidable.

When I saw an ad for this course on an Internet news site, it looked like just what we needed. As it turned out, it was! My wife and I are both incredibly impressed with everything about the course.

The presenter, Patrick Kilchermann, is knowledgeable, personable, and entertaining, without coming across as a know-it-all. In fact, it's almost like you're taking the course from a long-time friend.

The course not only covers the things one usually thinks about in relation to firearms and concealed carry, but many things that most people don't think about, such as the mindset of the aggressor and the mindset you need to have to counter it. I never knew there were so many things to consider concerning concealed carry or so many mistakes that need to be avoided.

Another thing this course will do is jar you out of your sense of complacency. (And if you don't think you are complacent   you probably are.) In fact, for me, the single most eye-opening thing was, to learn that  even law enforcement officers make mistakes that can be deadly. After all, if those folks can make such mistakes, I most certainly can, too.

This course is one of the best investments we have made in a long time, and certainly the best investment we have made in relation to self-defense training.

6575467,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Exceptional program, worth twice the price, buy it now. Ok that was the short version. Heres the rest of it. This is a 7 DVD set with about 14 hours total time of video instruction. This review is based on viewing the complete program.

The content:
Disc 1. Part 1: Mindset. Building Your Mindset Foundation: Destroy the top 15 myths that make effective self-defense impossible for most people.
Disc 2. Part 1: Mindset. Conditioning the Warrior Mindset: How the correct mindset is what separates survivors from victims.
Disc 3. Part 2: Training. Avoiding a Gunfight: Situational awareness skills, altercation avoidance tactics, the escape mentality, the shoot or don't shoot test.
Disc 4. Part 2: Training. The First 2 Seconds: Understanding the dynamics of violence as used by criminals, and how to respond for success.
Disc 5. Part 2: Training. Finishing the Fight: the principals of handgun combat that every armed American must know.
Disc 6. Part 3: Gear. The Armed Citizens Tools and Gear: How to effectively evaluate all gear, and how to select a gun, caliber, ammunition, a carry position, and a concealed carry holster.
Disc 7. Part 3: Gear. The Armory: Evaluating extras (from spare magazines and flashlights to memberships and attorneys), gear maintenance, and the physical effects of bullets.

The price: I have taken several hands-on handgun classes taught by law enforcement SWAT members. They are 4-6 hours each and cost $200-$250. Kilchermanns material is in complete agreement with these professionals and his video classes cover more than these classes possibly can due to time constraints. You get the why we do it this way, not just the what to do.

The presentation: Kilchermann may be a young guy, but hes got the precise mind of an engineer and the material is meticulously compiled, organized, and presented. Hes a great speaker without annoying mannerisms.

One of the best areas was getting away from the mentality of training to hit a target at a shooting range, versus understanding how self-defense situations happen in real life. How to avoid violent situations by reading the aggressor and the context was very valuable. Every handgun owner and concealed carry permit holder should have this course.

Make you feel like your sittiing right there infront of him talking about the information.  I liked the way he started with mindset and really made you think about what carrying a firearm really means.  Then he went into training and did a fine job at presening the several excellent ideas on how to train.  although it will be difficult to find a range to allow some of the thing he suggested but it is possible.  Then finally a good discussion on weapons and holsters and other associated equipment.  Very infomartive and I found it nearly impossible to stop watching.
My only critisims is he is maybe a little too informal and some of his shooting footage seemed .... odd but of course self defense isn't always straight forward now is it.

I recommend viewing each DVD part once, setting it aside for one to two day and then watch that part again before moving on. I think you will be surprised at what you missed, and what a better comprehension you will have on your second viewing. The only criticism I have is that the presentation format settings do not change. New parts could use new settings to help refresh the viewers perspective. Anyone thinking of conceal carry should take this course before arming yourself. Sticking a gun in your pocket is the easy part.

I have been considering concealed carry, and what really sold me on this program is that it doesn't start talking about being in a gunfight until the 4th of 7 DVDs.

The program host breaks down places to avoid, like parking garages, what times of day most crime happens, how to recognize when violence is brewing and who is most likely to start something, and how to de-escalate and avoid potentially dangerous situations. I think the first 3 DVDs should be required viewing for anyone of any age because it is the most level-headed real world description I have ever heard about how violence actually happens and how to avoid it.

While I am considering concealed carry and have not done it yet, I am sure the guns and gear DVDs have saved me many thousands of dollars of mistaken purchases. This isn't one of these programs where they stick 45 minutes or an hour on a DVD, every DVD in this series is FULL. I don't think it is really possible to oversell how much rock solid content and wisdom there is in this DVD program. Patrick Kilchermann and Concealed Carry University did a fantastic job in putting together this program and making it valuable to every American.",1407542400,,1504,4.629213483146067

6575475,5,B00MEUZIJC,I was looking for something more than just the concealed carry class I took.  This is exactly what I wanted and it is worth at least twice the price.  It covers many different scenerios and situations and gives you the mindset and confidence to face them.  It is all presented in an unbiased manner and totally without sponsors or plugging certain brand products.  Very professionally done and logical in it's progression.  What I thought I would buy for a carry weapon totally changed after watching this.  I will watch this and review things a number of times.  Many thanks to Patrick.,1407542400,,587,4.752475247524752

From 12 years old plinking with my dad to the Olympic tryouts for the 1996 US Shooting team. I was one of the first to receive my concealed carry permit 23 years ago in Florida. I thought I had prepared myself well to carry a firearm over the years....reading all that was available on the subject, Shooting on combat teams, working in the field of wholesale and retail firearm sales, to ALOT of practice.
Then I began taking this course and realized how much I didn't know! The program is well thought out, precise and Patrick delivers the information in a way that keeps you tuned in and wanting more! I would recommend this course to ALL that carry and those who intend to!

I have a concealed carry permit and have been carrying daily for about six years. I enjoyed the seven discs very much. Learned a lot  about self defense shooting of a practical rather than theoretical nature, ( who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks), and was straightened out on some of the myths of "" stopping power"". Also the information about what to expect when attacked is very valuable knowledge to help be prepared and understand the dynamics of an encounter.  Very excellent and informative program. It also makes it clear that all the suggestions in the lessons can be modified to suit individual needs. Pat does a personable job of making watching interesting and fun.

I went to the #6 dvd because I have not been comfortable in carrying even though I have had a CC permit since 1992 and had good training but didn't know why for sure I was not comfortable. After viewing the first 4 chapters of Disc 6 I now know what I must do to increase my awareness and start from begining on this series. This is comprehensive with true integrity and in depth research and instruction. This is not the run of the mill ""dirty Harry"" approach in cc defense. I am now excited to include my CC friends in my viewings and even my church since most of us do carry and have not had opportunity for this in depth study.

The Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self-Defense has increased our perspective not only in carrying a firearm, but also in the effective mind set that is required. Just to get a conceal carry license is not the end of the story. We must constantly keep on training to maintain our proficency, our memory mindset, and our muscle memory. This course is so outstanding and in-depth that we could not believe how much more we needed to learn, and this DVD set provided it to us.

I must tell everyone that the program is very long and I think it could be condensed and be more effective butI still recommend it.  I live in Fort Myers, Florida and I carry a 15 round CZ 9mm compact everyday even thought I normally wear shorts and a pullover golf shirt.  Concealed carry is a mindset.....get used to it and you feel unconfortable without your weapon.  The Concealed Carry University presentation teached one how important it is to be prepared and most important of all, Patrick teaches one how to get prepared.

I own and use many different guns for many different uses and this DVD set has so much practical real life uses for conceal carry ,Hunting and general safety that one must really watch it multiple times to truly soak in all the information available on these disks.

After the 20 or so hours of instruction, demonstration and advice, the 1st thing I realized is I need to watch it again to absorb many of the finer points of attitude, awareness, muscle memory, ways to practice, selecting gear, dealing with ""adrenalin dump"", movement, bystanders (are you starting to get the picture?) and the myriad other topics covered.  I don't often buy from internet advertising, but this is one product (library, in fact) that I know I will be consulting many times in the future.  Patrick Kilchermann has produced a quality product well worth many times the dollars I spent for it.  It's interesting to note, the price of quality instruction is 1/3 to 1/4 the price of a quality hand gun.

I recently purchased Patrick's Complete Concealed Carry Guide, to go along with my concealed carry license.  Patrick's 7 disc course, has proven to be one of the BEST collections, of pertinent information on concealed carry, AND, personal defense, that I have EVER seen.  He does WAY more, than just discuss shooting styles, types and calibers of guns, holsters types, and carry positions.  He ACTUALLY explains WHY, people act the way they act, and do the things they do, be them bad OR good.  I never realized that so many things, went into the human psyche.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, Patrick's 7 disc set, it will be some of the best, if not the BEST, money you've EVER spent on personal security and defense!!  Thank you Patrick, for a EXCELLENT product!!

My husband and I both obtained our Conceal and Carry licenses after the previous Presidential election-just cuz. My 19 yr-old daughter and I are Krav Maga enthusiasts and she is in training to become an instructor. We have a lot of hand to hand training with gun stripping but really needed to learn what to do if we ever have to use a gun. The videos are VERY informative about our rights should we ever have to discharge one into an attacker. As far as gun selection goes, the gear segment helped immensely. We will be trading our Taurus 9mm soon. :)
Our family enjoys sitting around and eating popcorn with these videos-so much cheaper than a trip to Disney World and they definitely imprint  a more permanent memory in us than tea with the Princesses.

It is amazing the kind of product an organization can put together when they are as passionate about a topic as you are. I highly recommend this to any long time conceal carry individuals or those just starting out or thinking about doing so. Even the most advance firearms experts could walk away with some new perspectives or knowledge on one of the many topics covered. And it is a MUST for any early stage CCW holders especially if you value your life and those you aim to protect (Yes, pun intended:)...I will definitely be looking for more of Concealed Carry University's products in the future..

6575492,5,B00MEUZIJC,"If you are a female who thinks she might want to carry a concealed weapon you need to watch these videos!
The first thing you will learn is ""do you have the mind set to use a gun to shoot a real person"". Not just a target.
The information about possible assailants and their mind set, is in itself worth watching the video.
Next you will find out what self defense is and what it is not.
If you decide you want to carry concealed (and will be able to use the weapon in your/others self defense)you are ready for the next step.
That step is selecting a hand gun, and learning how to chose where to carry it safely and concealed. And, how to care for a hand gun once you own one.
From there you will learn how to actually use your hand gun, if you are ever in a situation to do so.
If you have never carried a hand gun/fired one or cleaned one this is valuable.
If you have a lifetime of hand gun experience, you will learn things you never considered.
I would recommend the CD's to any person who wants to carry (or thinks they might want to carry) a concealed hand gun.",1407542400,,1069,4.095238095238095
6575493,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This Patrick Kilchermann offering is a wealth of valuable information for anyone considering carrying or already carrying.  After studying the 7 DVD's closely I realized two things: (1) how totally inadequate the state required concealed carry training really is, and (2) how little I and perhaps most others that carry know about concealed carry.  Being a lawyer I am always concerned about my personal liability and since I recently began carrying I have felt a much greater sense of responsibility than I have ever felt before.  Patrick's emphasis on this important issue was outstanding.

Patrick's reminder throughout this series regarding how persistent you must be to make it through all 7 DVD's is a good one to heed.  I am sure that their are specific DVD's that each of us has more knowledge of than others, but even those DVD's reveal many nuiances if not downright secrets that are important to the overall picture.  So be patient and don't skip any of them when you are viewing them.

All things said this package exceeded my expectations and I am thrilled to recommend it to others.  Buy it, study it and learn from it and your concealed carry will be much safer and personally rewarding.

6575501,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This program is a spot on logical next step for those who are serious about concealed carry as ""their way forward"".  They are always on the lookout to develop their skills and knowledge.

On the flip side, if you feel that you have ""carry"" all figured out and have nothing to learn, you too should make the investment and see this.  Most likely, if you are closed up about this topic you are a danger to yourself and others.  No matter how long you have carried, I'll bet there is material in this you never heard before and/or evidence to reverse some of your current beliefs.

I felt that this program  was a very good use of my time.  It is a combination of: things I never thought of + things I did not know + suspicions confirmed + corroboration of things I have learned myself over time. e.g. Static range shooting is bad training for survival + In a shooting, I may not hear my gun or feel their bullets + carrying a 5 shot snub is poor security + Karate etc. will not save me if I'm walking around in the white zone.

I like Patrick's style and feel his sincerity.  I have read so many articles of police forces shooting everything on the scene but the bad guys.  Cops, Karate experts, tough guys etc. being overcome easily by the ""surprise"" attack from behind by a skinny punk with a club and intent.  I've been through the false security ""I'll just shoot them"" phase.  It's also easy to reach the mental place where I want to resist the carry idea because of the civil suits and hassle if I ever do shoot someone.  Yet I will not be a willing victim...so I must play the carry game.

This program encourages me to continue yet stirs fears of the responsibility and dedication needed be a true and effective carry participant.  My need to read all the magazines and gun reviews seems lessened in comparison to my need to read more material like this where there is a deeper learning of the carry commitment .  My most important take-away: I don't want to shoot, but, if I'm forced to, I want to be mentally and physically prepared.  This program will get me there if I apply it.

I have already recommended the program to a friend who carries as a necessary next step if he is planning to continue.

6575502,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I must admit, I was a bit skeptical when ordering this set of DVD's but words can't express how valuable and great a decision it was.

I have been carrying concealed for well over 15 years. I was one of those guys that only believed in the 45 ACP since it was always referred to as the man stopper. Since viewing this course I have completely changed my views on concealed carry and have completely re structured my concealed carry firearm and habits. I always carried a  6-7 shot 45 ACP and now carry a Glock 19 with a spare mag.

This is by far the very best training course I have ever seen. It takes you through everything in great detail and shows you the reality of what a concealed carry individual is up against and how to train and deal with a real life threatening situation. It takes you step by step through the mind of the individuals you may encounter. It shows you the reality of ballistics and calibers. It shows you how to properly train and prepare for a real life encounter, what to do before during and after any situation. It covers equipment, holsters, laws and much more.

I could go on and on about all the details and priceless benefits of this course. In summary this course covers anything and everything you could ever possible learn. Nothing has been left out and all you could ever want to learn in included and then sum. The course is well worth every penny. What I like most of all is that you actually get DVD's and not some cheap download. I have sat down several times to go over different sections. I believe the total duration of the course is about 20 hours.

One big thanks and congratulations to Patrick for putting this course together.

6575503,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was a little apprehensive about getting this but am I glad I did.  The first DVD had me glued to the screen.  It was so informational!  I wanted to go through the whole program in one sitting after that but it was late at night so I figured I should tackle this in sections.  It's really a better way to retain more anyway and you will want to do that.  I have been considering CC for a while but wasn't sure I would want to and needed guidance around the whole idea.  Is it time for me to do this?  Remember the Boy Scout motto, it's great advice: Be Prepared.  This is it folks!  All those questions that pop up in your head about CC, they get answered here.  It has changed the way I think about protection for myself, family and friends.  If I end up in or around a violent situation, my awareness level and how I would react has changed for life.  It's not about being a gun-loving hawk, it's about being safe, sensible and not nave.  It is well worth the investment and I do not regret this purchase at all.",1407456000,,1015,4.11734693877551
6575504,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I purchased this set a few weeks ago for two reasons, First, because I am planning on becoming a concealed carry instructor, and second, because my son is going to school for criminal justice and wants to go into law enforcment. I needed something that was going to be comprehensive as well as up-to-date and easy to use. The DVD format allowed us to view the material at our own pace and on several occasions we were able to pause the video and discuss the issues in greater detail.

I'm impressed with this program for many reasons. First, because it's obvious that Patrick knows what he's talking about. The amount of time and study he has put into preparing these lessons is obvious by his command of the subject matter. Second, because he doesn't talk down to his viewers. A lot of times courses like this present the teacher as the ""untouchable super expert,"" and make the student feel like they will never be able to be as proficient or knowledgeable as he is. But this is not the case with Patrick. He presents the material as if he is speaking with people who are his equals. Third, the material is not pedantic and filled with technical jargon beyond the educational level of just about any viewer. One of the sureset indications that a teacher is truly interested in the education of his students is the way they speak. Patrick presents his material in laymans terms except on rare occasions when something more is necessary; and then he makes sure to explain what he means. Fourth, The material is real! What I mean by that is, he deals with real life circumstances. The last thing anybody needs is a program that feeds into the false impressions that Hollywood has dished out about what happens in a real gun fight. People don't fly backwards or fall to the ground when they get shot. Heck, they might not even stop charging at you! And that's something we need to know.

Initially, I was hesitant to purchase the program because I thought it was a little bit pricey. But that was only because I was worried that it would be like so many other programs out there, heavy on marketing and light on education. But I decided to take a chance because I thought, ""hey, if this program really teaches everything Patrick claims it teaches, then it would be worth ten times the price he's asking for it."" Well, I'm glad I took a chance on it, because it is worth every penny. In fact, I believe the lessons are absolutely invaluable! Nobody should carry a concealed weapon without the kind of knowledge contained in these DVD's.

I am very thankful to Patrick for putting these DVD lessons together and making them available to the public. And I recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone who carries concealed, wants to carry concealed, or is just interested in the subject.",1407456000,,2776,4.615384615384615

Well, it turns out my vibe was smack-on with this video series because it's a whole lot more than just a 'good' foundation...it's a great foundation to build on! Talk about an eye opener! If you are already carrying concealed or just starting out like me this is a must see series.

I think that it is morally significant that an early topic is threat recognition and related proper actions to avoid, de-escalate, and escape potential lethal-threat situations before the topic of using a concealed firearm is explored in depth. Those who carry because they are itching for a fight and view themselves as modern-day Wyatt Earps probably won't like that. But those  who recognize that gunfights, even those that are well-justified, are inherently dangerous to innocent bystanders as well as to the participants, will appreciate this approach.

The data presented seems to have been well-researched. It is also balanced; the viewer is not made to feel invincible even when well trained. The presentation seems a bit repetitious but that is how good teaching is done. Whirlwind presentations would not implant very much knowledge unless they were viewed many, many times. I retired from teaching in high schools and colleges, so I'm firm on that point. Also, the verbiage is liberally sprinkled with excellent videos that demonstrate the points made. The viewer is left with superb guidance on what to purchase for concealed carry and how to train oneself to properly use what is purchased.

My home state of Tennessee makes no distinction between permitting open and concealed carry so I would have liked to have seen just a smidgeon more presentation to cover open-carry considerations. That's the only ""complaint"" I have and it's minute since open carry is far easier than concealed carry. So, 99.8 %  of the set's contents still apply to my open-carry preference.",1407456000,,2035,5.026706231454006
6575507,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I'm highly attentive to local and world affairs and just recently became actively interested in ""concealed carry."" Sounds interesting and like something I needed to be thoroughly educated about but with so much information out there I didn't know where to turn to get the most comprehensive and beneficial information. One evening this series popped up and after reviewing ALL that it claimed to include I knew this had to be either"" too good to be true"", or exactly what I was looking for. Even though I am highly skeptical about purchasing ""info"" stuff online, my intuition and ""need to know"" won out and I bit the bullet and bought the set.  Sooooo glad I did.  The very first 2 DVD's on MINDSET were put first for a reason, I'm sure. That's the first hurdle I had to get past to begin with. I know I will review these over and over again to keep myself on track. But even after one viewing I felt confident that I can be mentally prepared to face an incident where I may need to defend myself and not be the ""shakiest gun in the west.""  I AM READY.  I have not yet completed the entire set, but from what I saw and have learned so far, I feel that I will gain the knowledge I need to be a confident, cautious, and educated ""warrior"" should the need arise, This is almost like having your own personal trainer by your side, and he can be there just by dropping the DVD into your computer,  If you are unsure of the future, and of your own capabilities to defend yourself if the need arises..

6575508,5,B00MEUZIJC,"As a former police officer (ten years in NY) and a CA resident the last 24 years, I understand and appreciate what it takes to be a responsible CCW holder, and the difficulties involved with obtaining a CCW license in many states.  I currently hold CCWs in several states. I have learned that the training course requirements in CA and NV for satisfying their knowledge and handgun proficiency demonstrations are probably more comprehensive to qualify for a CCW than elsewhere.  Yet their training courses cover just a small fraction of the information that this program includes.  I mention this so you understand my comments below in the context of my experience.

Based upon my experience with receiving CCW and handgun training, I can say with certainty that Patrick has done an exceptionally professional, thorough, and comprehensive job in creating the seven disk set of ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self-Defense.""  It covers everything a person who chooses to carry concealed needs to know and master to lead that lifestyle responsibly.  While very long, it is a subject that demands the detail that the program goes into and the breadth of subjects that it covers.  For anyone considering carrying concealed (no matter what state you live in), it's worth every cent invested in purchasing it and every minute of your time viewing it.

If there's any constructive criticism I can offer, it's that Patrick needs to do some modification to the white screen backdrop used extensively during his instructional lecturing. Having said that, what he communicates is of great value in spite of it.",1407456000,,1633,5.089887640449438
6575509,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Deserves 10 stars.  This is the information that should be taught when getting a CCW permit.

Other reviewers have covered in detail the content, organization, and presentation (all excellent).  I particularly appreciated the thorough discussion of types of threats, how to avoid them, and how to neutralize many threats prior to violence.  This information gives me a very good picture of the threat level to me and my family.  The good news is I'm much safer than I thought simply because I don't go to places with higher than normal danger (e.g., places where young men, young women, and alcohol mix), I don't do things to attract the wrong attention (e.g., no open display of worthwhile items), and I don't do things that reduce my alertness (e.g., use a cellphone in a parking lot).

The DVDs provide a thorough training program and rationale for the training.  Without this training, a CCW permit holder is likely to be ineffective or outright dangerous to innocents.  If all you can do is shoot holes in paper circles at a gun range, this program will help you train for a real fight.

Independent of whether or not a person carries concealed, the ""threat awareness and alertness"" training alone should be taught to everyone and, alone, is worth the price of the DVDs.",1407456000,,1275,4.8119266055045875

6575511,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am a new handgun owner and concealed carrier.  I wanted to be completely informed and trained properly and ordered the Armed Americans Complete Concealed Carry program.  Upon receipt could not wait to open the dvds.  I have found them to be very informative.  They do take a while to view however the time spent has been very worthwhile and I feel more confident in owning a gun for self defense and protection. I would like to see more women learn about guns and am sharing the program with a friend of mine.  There are so many aspects of that is not taught that one must make and take the time to learn.  I have been asked by a friend to start a womans group in our area and am leaning toward learning more to become a certified instructor of women an area that is needed.

Personally I highly recommend the program it is a very wise investment. One thing I would like to add I am retired and age 67 and feel a woman is not too old or young to learn.",1407456000,,954,4.180327868852459
6575512,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was very hungry to find information that would help me, based on intellect instead of emotion, careful evaluation instead of impulse, and humility instead of high self-esteem.  As it turned out I found what appeared to be information based on careful evaluation of a very emotional topic offered by what Impressed me as a humble guy, and in a very intellectual way.  I purchase 2 sets.  One for me and one for a very special family that is feeling very in need of .information.as they live in a constant state of fear due to numerous threats from someone that needs help.

This product educates the viewer on this topic like nothing else I have seen or heard of.  I have been a professional instructor for more than 20 years.  Few things transform egotistical, self assured, ""I don't need this training because I know all I need to know"" participants, into an attentive audience.  I have been fortunate to experience that change quite a few times as people realize they actually have a lot to learn.  This set does that, and in a dramatic way.

Perhaps the best thing I can say about it is that it forces you to deal with the seriousness of your choice to arm yourself, the incredible responsibility that comes with it, and a number of issues you've never given appropriate thought too.  I don't believe you can afford not to have this set.",1407456000,,1342,4.577405857740586

Since the course, I've changed carry weapons, caliber, position, and frequency.  I now carry a 9mm (16 + 1), an extra 16 round mag and carry virtually every waking minute.  Before the course I felt my J frame- 5 round S&W was adequate.  I've developed the ""mindset"" and work several times per week on my reaction/draw time and constantly improving.

The program is very thorough and gives insight and instructions to many methods and situations I have never thought of. It stresses that preparation and knowledge are the keys to victory and survival. It is worth every penny I spent to own it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who carries or is thinking of carrying a concealed weapon for their self defense and the protection of their loved ones. The video course is very long as it should be for proper instruction and education. It is obvious that a tremendous amount of time, study and hard work went into the production of this course. It is an EXCELLENT and well done video guide you will never regret purchasing.",1407456000,,757,4.614814814814815

I have purchased a new Glock19, concealment clothing, the MIC trigger guard cover, and many rounds of 9mm for practice. I am ready and comfortable for many hours of effective range training which I would not have except for the excellent information contained in this seven DVD set. I am now watching the disks a second time and I am learning additional information that I missed the first time through.

I would absolutely suggest this program to anyone who is serious about concealed carry i thought i learned all i needed in my cpl class but boy was i wrong  they did not teach me a 1/4 of what this program did. I could not find anything like it anywhere. So if your reading through these reviews and wondering if its worth the money the answer is YES this program is worth more i think with what you can save by the advice its well worth it plus all the knowledge you will receive is absolutely priceless.

6575518,5,B00MEUZIJC,"It is our right to keep and bear arms, but with that right comes an awesome responsibility! ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide To Effective Self-Defense""  is  not for someone who wants a 2 hour course  and you're done!  These DVDs  are not short, all 7 are about 3 hours each, and each one is loaded with information. On some of the DVDs you will  have to watch in 30 minute increments to absorb all of the information.
That being said, if you are thinking of getting a carry permit,  or if you are like me, got your permit, and found that the requirements of your state was minimal,  and you demand the best from yourself, this is an excellent start to your becoming a sheepdog (You'll understand if you've got what it takes!)",1407456000,,745,4.466666666666667
6575519,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This course is head and shoulders above the usual traing required for a CCW permit. It is well researched and well organized. There are three sections, mindset, training and gear. I would encourage anyone who owns a firearm that might be used for defense to watch the mindset section at least. Even if you don't carry concealed, it will provide you with an idea of what will happen to you physically and mentally in a defensive situation and will help you avoid such situations entirely.

The training segment provides ways to work out your skills for real world situations where things are not planned out and are going south fast. This training improves a lot more than just shooting accuracy. It focuses on deploying your sidearm under stress when fear is trying to overide your concious actions. Its also a lot more fun than just punching holes in paper.

The section on gear makes some good recommendations and provides plenty of information to allow you to adapt your gear o our own situation. If you require different equipment than is recommended you will be able to use the information to adapt to your situation.

This is a great opportunity to learn things that could save your life or keep you out of some really big trouble. The cost of a few boxes of ammo is better spent here and you can get back to target practice after the course.",1407456000,,1348,4.631799163179917

6575522,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This cd set is definitely worth the time and money.  I learned a lot about concealed carry and personal protection.  In addition, the sections on equipment selection was a huge help.  Patrick offers explanations as to why things should be done a certain way and why certain equipment is good in certain situations, which helps to understand what to look for and it helps retain information when you know the reasoning.  Highly recommended!",1407456000,,439,4.972602739726027
6575523,5,B00MEUZIJC,"There are two questions that everyone considering obtaining a concealed carry permit should ask themselves. Will I be able to react appropriately when faced with a life or death situation, and will I be able to protect my weapon from being taken and used against me. Being a combat veteran I have never thought about the training that the Army provided to overcome the psychology and physiology of a combat incident. I can now see how easily someone who is untrained could freeze at just the moment when you need to react. Pat provides the mindset and training that will cause you to confront and, hopefully, conquer the psychological and physiological events that will happen to you when confronted with a lethal force situation so that you can prevail. Pat provides an all important section on how to avoid a lethal force situation in the first place, something extraordinarily important in this day of increasing criminal and civil prosecution. I particularly liked the section that provided instruction and video examples of how to train for the first 2 seconds of a lethal force encounter. Totally changed the way in which I carry my weapon! The exercises on how to get moving in the right direction to avoid being shot and to deal with multiple threats was invaluable. There are discussions on weapons and equipment that are spot on. I've had my CWP for years and thought as ex-Army I was prepared. I learned just how unprepared I was during this course.",1407456000,,1460,4.820717131474104
6575524,5,B00MEUZIJC,"This is an outstanding video set with tons of useful information.  It is many hours long, but broken into very logical video sections and chapters.  And let's face it, when dealing with firearms and protecting yourself and loved ones, there are a multitude of factors to consider, and a lot one needs to know and practice.

I have years of hunting experience with shotguns and rifles, but only recently took up handguns and obtained a CC license.  It would have taken me years to acquire the knowledge in the videos, and particularly for someone new to this space, it makes you much more comfortable and confident that you can handle a handgun safely, prudently, and legally.

The information in this video set went well beyond what I learned in a much shorter Concealed Carry course required by the State.

A lot of the information in the programs deals with how to identify and avoid or mitigate potentially dangerous situations, so that lethal force is not required.  That information is very helpful for anyone, even if they don't carry concealed.  I am considering having my adult children watch at least certain sections of the videos, even though they don't have pistols and may never own one.

The section on gear is very helpful, especially if you have not owned pistols, tactical flashlights, holsters, etc previously.  It can make you very knowledgeable before you go to a gun store, and help you select what works best for you.",1407456000,,1439,4.813008130081301

Course overview:  The course teaches how to avoid shooting someone in the first place, which I really liked.  But if you are placed in a position where you have to shoot, what are your options and how to maximize those options for a positive outcome.  It also teaches how to identify different personalities and how to deal with them.  Equipment selection, legal responsibility, and insurance are also discussed.",1407456000,,606,4.844660194174757

I have been a DOD employee for over 28 years and spent numerous years deployed and in combat environments so many things discussed here I have brushed on previously however, to get the type of instruction you will receive in this video you can expect to look long and hard. There are many steps you will face during your training with this video set that are going to include both classroom and practical environments. I don't care how many years you have, or have not, spent using a firearm or for what purpose, you WILL receive top of the line instruction and advice with this set. Don't hesitate to go through it more than once, you never know when you may have missed something or just need a quick reminder on what you previously covered. Always remember, carrying concealed is a very large step.

6575527,5,B00MEUZIJC,It is very well put together and I appreciate very much. I encourage anyone that has concealed carry license to make use of this product and will help them very much for the concealed carry training. Even though it is very lengthy you never get what you need in the regular concealed carry class.,1407456000,,296,4.5
6575528,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Below is my first review of this product that I submitted last year. I still stand by it. However, since then, while promoting this set to friends and acquaintances the biggest complaint I heard was the price. Yes, it is not cheap. but neither is the production quality and the information provided. Once bought it is yours forever to review and follow. If you go to any other handgun training that covers concealed carry as well as the laws you should know, you will pay far more (I went to FrontSight, who had excellent training and coverage of concealed carry laws). If I want to go there again I will have to pay again - not as much - but including travel and lodging, a lot more.

Patrick has put together a video that is in many ways more comprehensive then any other live training will provide - and you can watch it as many times as you want. I consider it a great review of everything I learned at FrontSight and more. I also bought his second set - Master Handgun Mastery - which I will review later. I mention that because, as in any training of whatever subject, there are many different views. Patrick has specific views that differ from many other views on handguns, their use and proper training. If you have gone to another live training as I have you may see the differences. Patrick is absolutely honest in his stating that if you are not satisfied, for any reason, he will refund your purchase price. I am not sure how that will work through Amazon, as Amazon has a great refund policy also but it may be time limited.

Read what I state below and then buy the entire program Part 2 was just as good as the rest and the entire set is invaluable and forever yours when you buy it.

---------

Patrick, I liked your Part 1 and 3 video's and was just beginning your Part 2 when I received your e-mail of August 8, 2014. You have committed the same error  that I have complained to Amazon and other sites about and that is requesting a review before I have had a chance to fully utilize it (whether it is reading a book, watching a video, or purchase of a hard item like binoculars, tripods, or holsters) whatever it may be. I mistrust a lot of reviews for the very reason that most haven't had enough time to fully evaluate the items. If you are going to offer a prize for the purchase of the set, it should be to the first 3,000, or whatever you feel it should be, who have purchased it, not all who can get a review in before a deadline. Now you will be receiving a lot of reviews that may or may not be fully evaluated and others left out because they could not access Amazon or email you. I read 12 of the first 61 reviews (now up to 65 in just 20 minutes) and only five of them stated they had gone through the complete set. I marked all the others as not helpful..

Now, I am stating I have only watched Part 1 and Part 3 of the set and just started Part 2, barely 1 hour into the first disk. My review covers that and only that. I have attended Front Sights (FS) 4 day hand gun course and 1 day concealed carry course and have obtained CCP's from Idaho, Nevada and Utah which allows me to carry in about 34 states. Your part 1 disks were a good review of the info I received in the 1 day concealed carry class - in fact it was a more detailed and comprehensive review and I thought you did a great job on it. Your Part 3 section was not nearly as well polished as your presentation in Part 1 and felt rushed. Your coverage however was a little more comprehensive then FS's. They basically prohibited most of the hand guns and holsters that you found inadequate. However, I suspect they may disagree with your choice of concealed carry holster that you use. However, I agree with you it is your choice as long as you understand the potential problems with it. They did cover the basics of picking a lawyer, what to expect if you do kill someone in self-defense, being aware of your surroundings at all times, etc.

Now as for Part 2 I can only comment on what I saw so far (about 50 minutes) and what I saw at the beginning of the first disc of Part 1. You and Ignatious would have some disagreement on shooting one handed and the name of his organization says it all - Front Sight. Almost all misses are due to playing so called cowboy or imitating Bruce Willis. It is imperative at all times to practice lining up your sights and developing muscle memory ,as you state, with both hands gripping the handgun to get those sights up and steady and on target before pressing the trigger. Perhaps you cover that in Part 2. When I finish the three discs in Part 2 I'll come back and comment on them at that time.

Again, reconsider offering the $1000 prize to only those who post a review prior to Monday night. Offer it to all who have placed their trust in you by that date and save yourself $500 (or add them together or have a first and second place prize).

6575529,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I'm New to Concealed Carry, but not to firearms use.  I tend to over-research before I do anything important, especially something as crucial as protecting my family.  BUT THE RESEARCH IS DONE.  I have found a no-nonsense, rational, mathematical, and wise approach to the whole category of self-defense in this DVD series.  I have read other websites and blogs and books religiously for a few months.  This series blows them all away, and combines what is helpful, and weeds out the excesses and personalities of those other resources.

What I love most is that the author is both humble and yet excited about self-defense.  He clearly passes on that enthusiasm and humility in this DVD series.  He never gets sidetracked from the main goal.  He is not training hunters or soldiers.  He is training people for self-defense.  There are many lessons that hunters and soldiers can learn from this DVD, or that they can bring to the CCW lifestyle.  But that constant thread of the kind of self-defense situations you are mathematically likely to face, the kind of gear you need for that situation, the kind of training and accuracy you need to be prepared for--all of this keeps YOU ON TARGET.  For example, knowing that statistics prove that 70% of all shots fired in actual self-defense situations MISS THE TARGET means that I better have enough ammo capacity, and the humility to realize that as great as my targets may look at the range, when fired under stress, the situation is different!

I am trying to decide what gear to buy, what caliber weapon to purchase, how to explain to family, friends, co-workers what and why I am preparing for self-defense...  This DVD series keeps ME ON TARGET in my thoughts, decisions, purchases, and conversations with friends and loved ones.

Patrick really did an awesome job with instruction clarity and setting levels of importance. I now feel better prepared to go out and carry concealed, and am working on the personal training defined in this course and the many reading references included in the course.

I now understand the degree of responsibility required to carry and I am moving forward strong and solid. This course is very thorough and without it, I would not have advanced to the level that I am today. I have referred it to many of my friends that own, carry, or are considering carrying. And they are thankful for the recommendation.

I felt I must do my do diligence to educate myself in order to have the tools to make this decision and to realize the full commitment I was about to make. When I saw Pats course I felt like this would fit the educational bill. I was not wrong. Pat has seemingly covered every detail about carrying CCW.

6575538,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I have been a concealed permit holder and daily handgun carrier for over 20 years.  Realizing the awesome responsibility that is assumed when one decides to carry, I have attended many seminars, live training events and read many books concerning the legal, moral and physical aspects of carrying a weapon which could save a life, take a life, seriously maim or injure a person innocent or criminal and which could result in serious legal problems including long term imprisionment.

The decision to carry or not should be arrived at only after a person has come to full realization of the awesome responsibility involved and committed themselves to pursue ongoing mental and physical training for the duration of their lives so long as they carry.

Out of all the training I have submitted to over the years, Patrick Kilchermann and the Concealed Carry University provide, in my opinion the most complete course for the mental, legal, and physical preparation of becoming a legally armed citizen who will take the measures necessary to protect, themselves, their families and the public at large when necessary.

This course, which can be taken over and over again from the comfort of your own home and with your family present, will also teach you how, if at all humanly possible to avoid the use of your firearm and come away unharmed. A skill sadly lacking in most firearm oriented programs.

I consider Patrick Kilchermanns, Concealed Carry University to be the Harvard University equivalent for the armed citizen. In my opinion it is that good!",1407456000,,1550,4.992248062015504

At first the program seems overwhelming, but after starting it, its difficult not to continue because the information provided is either contrary to what is ""conventional wisdom"" about concealed carry or dispels the myths created by superficial training, while It expands on the ""good information"" already possessed. The first two discs are critically important to beginning to understand the importance of the psychological ""positioning"" to develop the ""warrior mindset,"" realization of the responsibility for carrying concealed and knowing the conditions under which to use deadly force is necessary. I strongly recommend this program to anyone who is interested in learning and understanding the multiple aspects of concealed carry responsibility.",1407456000,,933,5.768115942028985
6575546,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Where do I begin? I have been an Amazon consumer for many years and RARELY if ever will take the time to write a review. I purchased this box set before Amazon offered it. However, after realizing it is now available here, I decided to take the time to write this review. As a person who'd never picked up a gun there were many thoughts racing through my head when I decided to pursue this journey. After receiving the necessary basic hand gun training I then decide to further my pursuit. While there were many good teachers and classes which I attended I'd always felt there was something missing, a need for real event traing and a way to be mentally prepared for the unthinkable event. Prior to becoming a concealed carry citizen there were a host of exploits, thoughts, and concerns which I had to consider. So in my quest for more knowledge and after what seemed like an envading infomercial during the time I was seeking for it on the Internet, I happened to stumble upon Patrick's Concealed Carry University box set. Being skeptical, I managed to listen through the entire presentation and before I knew it I'd placed an order for this set of DVD'S. To make a long story short this was the exact knowledge I had been missing from previous training classes. The ability to be effective both mentally and physically in the event you must defend yourself is priceless. And, this is exactly what this course offers. As of July 2014, I have received my CCW permit in California, and I am proud to be a law abiding 2nd amendment arms bearer with the correct knowledge on what it truly means to carry concealed. .

6575547,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am 67 years old, and I live in Texas.  I have had a CHL since the first year it was available in our state, which is approaching 20 years now.  This is the most thorough information I have come across regarding the overall subject of concealed carry.  One of my objections in the passed has been the lack of complete information disseminated in the mandatory classes for the original license and later for the several renewals I have attended.  In all of these classes there has been almost no discussion about when it is legal to defend yourself or your loved ones with deadly force.  Tactics of avoidance and combat have been completely absent.  This program has been very helpful in all of the areas which are sadly lacking in our government provided classes.  I am very happy that our state allows us to carry concealed, and I applaud our officials for that, but I think they should adopt a program such as this one and make it mandatory for all who want to carry.  Anyone who wants to carry concealed should be responsible for being trained both physically and mentally to do so, and in my opinion the state should help with that effort.  Thanks to Concealed Carry University for putting out this high quality program.  Now we just need to make sure that more of our citizens are exposed to it.",1407456000,,1301,4.521367521367521
6575548,4,B00MEUZIJC,"At 19, I am perhaps the youngest of the first 3000 or so to purchase this program. I am a busy student and haven't even finished the program completely at the time of this posting, but I wanted to get a review up. Since before I could spell, I've enjoyed shooting guns of every type. I thought that anyone who had a respect for firearms and responsibly owned them would be safe. I've come to see a deficit in how average citizens are being prepared by CCW license instructors. I've seen experienced gun owners completely incapable of effectively protecting their families. This program is exactly what I was looking for. I've tried to ignore the sick feeling I get when a friend or family member lacks one of the three pillars of self-defense presented in this video set--mindset, training, and gear. I now have a resource to recommend to loved ones. Even though I won't get my CCW for a couple more years, I will continue to refine a sheepdog mindset and be as prepared as this country's laws allow. As a black-belt, I take self-defense seriously and value being prepared for every level of force that presents itself. This program does more than just teach you how to shoot a gun--a short-sighted philosophy that has gotten many well-intentioned gun owners into trouble. So yes, this program will help people who can't legally or practically conceal carry. It about a lot more than just having a gun with you.

In this program Pat brings a relaxed professionalism that proves easy to learn from. There is none of the usual cockiness one often finds in the gun community. He won't scare away a timid user of the program, nor will he frustrate an enthusiastic one. The program is the perfect length to cover the needed topics without being too long.

I purchased this DVD set never having fired a handgun, hoping I would gain a little bit of insight into the great responsibility that comes with owning a firearm before I go out there into the world with one at my disposal.  I was NOT disappointed.  There are three parts to the program:  Mindset, Training, Gear.  Personally, I found the first section on mindset most useful, particularly the part about the myths surrounding what a gunfight is and is not.  Indispensable advice!  Additionally, the training portion of the video that deals with malfunctions was extremely helpful, as this is something that concerns me as a newbie.  If you are new to guns or to the concept of concealed carry, this program will give you mountains of knowledge that I honestly don't know where else you would get.

I was in the US Army and received basic combat training with M16A2 rifle, M203, and .50cal training.  After a grueling two year wait to get the permit in my hands (crazy waiting list in my county), there I was with a new shiny CCW permit.  Now what!?!?!

I've got a 2 1/2 year old son, so getting quality down-time is a rare luxury in my household.  It's taken about 25 days, but I am now through with the with the 7-disk training disk set.

I chalk that up to simply transitioning from (what Patrick refers to as) a sheep to a sheep dog.

The course instructor is an excellent communicator and is extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of CCW training and tactics, and he is very easy to listen to.  The visuals he uses are impressive.  He covers things like the mindset of the people who may (or may not) require an armed response from a citizen like you or me.  When I saw how long the course was, I felt a little intimidated.  But after I started it, it was like a good book that you just can't put down.

I would take another class from him without hesitation.  Now I feel like I'm finally understanding what that dreaded confrontation between me and an armed assailant might be like.

6575565,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I finished the DVD program.  It was definitely worth my time.  Being a retired cop from a major metropolitan police department, I was quite familiar with a lot of the stuff covered (from both experience and training).  It was only recently, however, that I finally decided to switch from my old wheel gun to a Glock.  Obviously program was no substitute for putting in time at the range to familiarize myself with shooting a semi-automatic.  Ive been retired for more than 20 years, and the shelf life for my training doesnt last that long. Some of it becomes outdated; more of it simply deteriorates from lack of use.

If I can find valuable information in this program despite my previous years of training and experience, I think most other people could, too.  Active duty cops from departments with serious training programs may be an exception.  Active or retired military would not.  Ive been a U.S. Marine, and Ive been a cop.  The skill sets definitely overlap, but they are far from being the same.  Concealed carry in the civilian world is much different from carrying a weapon in a war zone: tactically, morally, and especially legally.

This program motivated me to remedy the lackadaisical and casual attitude I had fallen into regarding carrying a concealed weapon, even though my HR218 card makes me legal in all states. It also motivated me to break loose with a few bucks (quite a few, actually!) and sign up for a 2-day combat shooting course to bring my skills back up to par.  Although Ive done pretty well insofar as maintaining my physical condition despite being an old guy, I believe the confidence one gets from keeping his self-defense skills sharp provides something intangible that stops the bad guys from viewing him as an easy target because hes the weakest wildebeest in the heard.",1407456000,,1812,4.806451612903226

Shortly after, in February of 2012, a gentleman that lived within 2 miles of my home was dragged out of his car around 5:00p.m. by three young teenagers, and  beaten so severely that he will never walk, talk, or be able to feed himself, the rest of his life. This act changed he and his family's lives forever! After hearing this story on the news, I decided to arm myself as I do not want to be in that same situation. After deciding to acquire my CCW, I first took an online course to meet requirement of ""training"". After a couple of months practicing at a local range, I needed more. I then took a course with a well respected and qualified instructor, and learned a lot more and felt a lot more confident in my ability however still needed more but couldn't afford  the extra classes. When I saw this program advertised, I was curious and looked at it closer. When i watched the video, I thought, this is a well thought out training program. Then I got to the price... and thought, if I can't afford the classes, how can I afford this? After weighing all options, I chose to take a big financial leap to purchase this program. I figured that it is far less expensive than even One trip to a hospital, and now, I am so GLAD I did!!  It is a time commitment to be sure, however one of the best parts of having this DVD program is that it can be revisited at will, and if someone is currently carrying, is planning to carry, or have carried for a while, there are lessons for everyone. If there are weapons in the home, it could, and should be viewed by other family members (age appropriate) as well. The instructor is teaching you one on one, and demonstrating scenarios in a real life manner. The quality of information in this program will remain long after the cost is forgotten OR paid for itself, by not having to deal with a situation, as I mentioned earlier.

This stands to be the best product that I've come across yet. Whether you've been in the game for decades or days I'd highly recommend this set. The content is second to none and it's really easy to work through. I've never retained so much information. 5 stars doesn't do it justice. Get this set!",1407369600,2,455,4.62962962962963

I have also seen it mentioned on the http://bayushooters.com website. There is a lot of good information in the DVDs.,1407369600,,271,6.157894736842105
6575578,4,B00MEUZIJC,"Patrick,bravo! My wife and I  had our eyes open wide while watching your course. Everyone with a CCW permit should be required to expand to the knowledge you present. Your course is the new normal in today's world. CCW Permit training I fear leaves the student with a false sense of competence. Sad, but true. As a former sheep I can say be prepared, and your course makes that possible. Perhaps in future versions you might include more for the Ladies.

Great Job,
Rich and Carol Falk",1407369600,11,485,4.563218390804598
6575579,5,B00MEUZIJC,I finished viewing the entire program and I found it extremely helpful. It was well worth my time and money and I would recommend it to both beginners and those who have been carrying for a while. The contents of the program provided tons of useful and in some cases critical information. I have been through several conceal carry classes but this was by far the most valuable information I have received. I'm giving the program to my son in a few weeks so he can learn from it as well. I think it's a must for anyone who already conceal carries or is just thinking about. There is a time commitment to get through it all but well worth it.,1407369600,2,640,4.297520661157025
6575580,5,B00MEUZIJC,"Fantastic course.  I love the way it makes you think about concealed carry, it is a very big decision and this course covers many situations.  It also shows that the best way to avoid a bad situation is to avoid areas where bad things are more likely to happen.
I am not new to guns I am new to concealed carry and I consider this course is just as important as your decision on a weapon.",1407369600,,388,4.092105263157895
6575581,5,B00MEUZIJC,"My only regret is I didn't have this 20 years ago. I wish I would have had this course prior to conceal carry because I conceal carry every day even though I was not sure of my abilities and what  to expect in a life or death situation. I was not even sure when I was allowed to defend myself or others. Patrick Kilchermann gives you clear cut guidelines to prepare for a confrontation, whether or not you shoot, and what to expect afterwards. ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense"" DVD covers everything you need to know to prepare for a life or death situation whether you are at home or out in public. You will learn how to be aware of your surroundings and to be at condition yellow all the times so you are not caught off guard. I feel much more confidant when I carry now and much more aware of what is going on around me and how to avoid a potentially bad situations and therefore possibly avoid a self defense situation altogether.

Patrick Kilchermann also offers other resources to become more knowledgeable and to be better prepared which includes other DVD's that get more specific such as  ""Incredible Handgun Accuracy: From the Ground Up"" which deals with proper shooting grip and stance and also how to dry fire practice that immediately gives you much better accuracy. In a stressful situation with an adrenaline dump your body wants to spray the bullets as fast as possible which means you will be lucky to hit the attacker once and this DVD will show you how to slow your shooting down and be more accurate in the hope you will hit the attacker in a vital spot thus stopping the attack.

I highly recommend ""The Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide to Effective Self-Defense"" DVD as it is very detailed and will answer most, if not all your questions. When it comes to conceal carry and the times we live in now, it is a must for every shooter to be prepared for the worst case scenario. Even if you never have to defend yourself  in a life or death situation you will be more prepared than most people. Every conceal carry holder needs to realize that the conceal carry classes you are required to take gives you the basics but it is up to us to be as prepared as possible and to refine our skills so we do not end up on the wrong side of the gun!",1407369600,5,2318,4.431924882629108
6575582,5,B00MEUZIJC,I am a 70 year woman who developed a warrior mindset many years ago when I made up mind to never again be a victim.  I have had a CCW for over 20 years.  This Armed American's Complete Concealed Carry Guide is the best information I have had so far.  It is nice to know that I'm not being paranoid when it comes to being prepared to protect myself and my loved ones.  I urge all Americans to get this series and study it to ready and prepared if the situation should arise when you might have to defend yourself.  I believe in being a responsible gun owner and have taught my children to be responsible gun owners.  I know from past experience that law inforcement really do want to protect us but it is not a reasonable expectation.  I have only completed the first two discs and have watched some of it twice.  I am anxious to start the third disc.  I believe this should be mandatory for anyone who is carrying or considering carring a gun,1407369600,2,942,4.247191011235955
6575583,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I was sold on Concealed Carry Universitys Program in the first 10 minutes of listening to Patrick describe its contents. I purchased the program and  completed it in just under three weeks. I have owned fire arms for home defense and protection for close to 50 years, but until I absorbed the Concealed Carry Program, I was unaware of how little I really knew, nor how ill prepared I was.

Patricks real world understanding and presentations of mind set, situational awareness, the attackers psyche and motivations, preparation for the first two seconds, etc. are very well planned out and presented as a logical progression toward KNOWING when, where, and  IF deadly force should and can be legally utilized, and HOW to use it.

In my opinion, his Concealed Carry Guide should be a MANDATORY part of any  training required for a concealed carry permit in all fifty states, or even those who just plan to keep their weapon in their home or on their property.",1407369600,4,958,4.781818181818182
6575584,5,B00MEUZIJC,"I am not some paid spokesman. I am just another armed citizen that is trying to do the very best I can to protect my family. I knew that my training was lacking and I needed some way to improve. And to do this I took a chance and bought this set. What is the result?

I BRAG about the importance of viewing these DVDs!

They have changed the way I view my conceal carry in a very important and beneficial manner. These DVDs should be the standard for all concealed carry courses. To me this material is vital, VITAL, for all armed citizens to watch and learn from. I feel better about carrying, because I feel better prepared, especially mentally. I have only completed through disk #4, but I now have a much better perspective of the total picture that an armed citizen must consider and factor into everyday life.

I have also gained a better perspective on the reality of a violent encounter and what actions I must take to avoid, and if conditions require, win the gun fight. It has shown me the gaps in my training and how to close them.

I thank the creators of this set very much, I am glad that I took the chance to buy and view these DVDs; it has been a great decision! I am a better protector of my family after watching these DVD's and learning and acting from them.

I highly recommend buying them to all persons that are truly interested in protecting their family, themselves, and friends.",1407369600,55,1403,4.360153256704981
6575585,5,B00MEUZIJC,"my wife and i sat through this training set and will be forever enlightened. we have been through one other video training and sat under one personal training but have never had an extensive education such as this. i warn anyone, it is thorough and exhaustive because of it; therefore, it is best to plan a long session each time and do only one at the time. you will have everything you need (except actual range time)
to protect yourself and others should the occasion arise. given the current state of affairs, i assure you it is coming. prepare while there is time and good resources.",1407369600,9,588,4.556603773584905
6575586,4,B00MEUZIJC,"While not a reviewer by any means, I can say that I drew valuable lessons from the entire series. My state's CC rules leave a lot of room for imagination and guesswork, and this series certainly answered a lot of my questions. As I mentioned to Mr Kilchermann in my review to him, that the ""tell them what you are going to tell them, tell  them, summarize, and then review"" left me anxious for the program to move along, but in all honesty, he did reinforce the elements, and the value of the topics are not in doubt. Far more depth and range of subjects discussed and demonstrated than I would have imagined. A valuable education for those who can't attend a dedicated training school.",1407369600,12,686,4.488
6575587,4,B00MEUZIJC,"I liked this program a lot, and I now know pretty much all of the fundamentals and a lot of  advanced knowledge of concealed carry procedures, guns, protecting myself, family, and others.
I put this knowledge into practice every time I go to the gun range now. And I will be reviewing these DVDs in once in a while to be sure I am remembering the things taught in this course.

Patrick is a very good teacher, and it is obvious that he cares about people and this subject. He radiates trustworthiness and confidence in his instruction.

I especially appreciated learning about the best sources for guns, ammo, gear, and what books to read to learn even more. I recommend this program to anyone who is serious about protecting themselves, their family, and others.",1407369600,2,763,4.67910447761194
8671827,5,B00MEUZIJC,"There is a lot of information packed in this 7 disk set (over 20 hours).  The information provided is very good, however, especially Part 1 (disk 1 & 2), IMO was dry as far as at the presentation level.
I agree with others, as this should be a part of a CCW program.  The information I obtained out of it was above and beyond what I received in my CCW class (16 hours).  If one is going to commit to carrying, then one should always be willing to learn, and this is definitely a great way to expand one's education.
I enjoyed the few splices of 'Youtube' style video, while speaking of certain concepts of what actually occurred during an actual gun fight.  The information of how to limit ones being in a risky situation to begin with was very beneficial.  And what could occur both during and after the unlikely aspect of requiring the use of a firearm also expanded my knowledge.
I appreciated the pros and cons of certain type of gear, and how to maintain one's gear.
If one is considering, or already is carrying, one should take the time to watch these videos.",1525219200,,1066,4.3908629441624365

I would  recommend these disks to anyone considering a concealed weapons certification in their State. What Patrick Kilchermann teaches would be difficult to challenge by any instructor. Almost everything he says is backed up with statistics.

The reason I gave this set of disks a four instead of a five. It is obvious that the author has never been personally involved in the aftermath of a actual gun fight situation, thank God. Patrick's advice about not giving legal counsel is absolutely correct.  Having said that I felt that he should have provided insight into what to expect after a gun fight situation. This type of information could have been obtained by interviewing people that have actually been through a gunfight and its aftermath. This would only be what these individuals had actually experienced and would, therefore, not be construed as legal advice.",1510531200,9,990,5.136645962732919
