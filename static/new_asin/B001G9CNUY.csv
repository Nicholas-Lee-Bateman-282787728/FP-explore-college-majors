3598314,5,B001G9CNUY,"I had the first Jorge Cervantes DVD, but I gave it to a friend as a gift, so when this came out, I figured I'd get discs 1 and 2, plus some other marginally useful stuff for the extra $10 ""Box Set"" price. When it arrived, I must say I was surprised and impressed!

The packaging is very nice, when you open it up, there's lots of awesome bud photos. There's a big booklet with Jorge articles and grow info, too.

The bonus disc is really long, with lots of extra garden tours, and special features. ""Jorge's Guide to Amsterdam"" was cool, like the type of show you'd see on a pot-friendly travel channel. And of course, the discs #1 and #2 are full of the thorough information you'd expect from Cervantes. I was very happy with the value from the box set, and overall I'd recommend it!",1235088000,11,784,4.29054054054054

3598321,4,B001G9CNUY,Great to watch with a J and a notebook.  Taught me alot of things and has increased my yeild by at lest 30%.  Kinda spendy thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars.,1270944000,2,163,3.764705882352941
3598322,1,B001G9CNUY,"Typical Jorge drivel.  Half of what he says is wrong and unless you are an experienced grower you won't be able to figure out which half.  His articles are the main reason I stopped subscribing to High Times.  I suggest if you are truly interested in growing, you check out titles that are more academic in their approach to hydroponics.  When it comes to growing, there is nothing special about MJ, it is just another plant.  These type of books/DVD's just serve to waste your weed money.",1260316800,6,489,4.574712643678161
3598323,3,B001G9CNUY,"This DVD set shows you the basics of how to grow both indoor and outdoor - beginning with set up through curing and everything in between. However, it does not go into much detail regarding problems that come up. Also, the first DVD is really all you need. Most of the second DVD is a repeat but it does contain some new material and the third bonus DVD is just that: 95%+ of just showing you gardens Jorge visited. I would buy just the first DVD and one or two books of details instead of the three DVD set.",1238284800,20,508,4.141414141414141
