6255744,5,B00IAR2DJG,"This man is truly something unique.  We saw him on our local PBS station in MY Life As A Turkey and were blown away by his observations,  and sheer presence. At the end of the program, there was a notice that he had gone to Montana to live with a herd of mule deer - and here he is!  He has such an insight into animals, it is incredible. We watch these over and over and are impacted by them the same way each time.  What will he live with next?",1403049600,2,446,3.868131868131868
6255745,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Having seen this guy raise and live with wild turkeys, I thought I would love his attempt to do the same with mule deer.  Once again, he has wowed us with the wonders, including both the joys and sorrows, of seeing life through the eyes of a wild creature.  This DVD is beautifully filmed and leaves you with a greater respect and understanding of the wild mule deer...and of all animals we share this planet with for that matter.

He spent years getting to know a herd of wild mule deer, day in and day out spending time with them, until finally he was accepted by the ""matriarch"" of the herd.  After this, he was no longer treated as a man, but as another mule deer...he was even groomed by the deer!  If another human came into view, these deer still shot off over the horizon and so they could not be considered tame by any means.  Yet, he was surprised to find that, after a while, they would even respond to his calling out the names he had given them.  He also witnessed their capacity for intense grief as one of the mother deer lost her fawn and his own grief at the dangers they are forced to deal with, both from other animals, from the weather, and from human hunters.

Anyone who enjoys hunting should see this movie as it imparts a deeper sense of respect for animals and the feeling that we definitely should be honoring their sacrifice when they are killed.  For this movie shows that they can think and feel as much as any human being, even if different than us.

I can't wait to see where this guy goes next...and what wild animal he will touch and give us a window into understanding.",1399852800,11,1603,4.331103678929765
6255746,5,B00IAR2DJG,"I too just saw this on PBS and thought it the finest, most authentic nature story I've been privileged to see.  Joe Hutto's quiet, determined patience in winning over these Mule Tailed deer is a lesson in itself - and invites you to join in.  As a scientist, artist and naturalist Joe's  authentic, natural way eventually wins acceptance by the 'herd' and their life and adventures together are moving and remarkable.  Wyoming's Wind River Mountain range takes it's terrible toll with extreme winter weather, mountain lions and wolves - so the 'orange jacketed' hunters with high powered riffles and no urgency for food is infuriating and heartbreaking.  Experience Joe, the deer and the love and sadness for yourself!",1398470400,7,718,5.0508474576271185
6255747,5,B00IAR2DJG,Everyone on the planet should see this video.  This Wonderful video shows the amazing relationship we can have with the wild if we can only be still and join in with these beautiful wild creatures.,1398297600,15,197,4.628571428571429
6255748,5,B00IAR2DJG,"This is a remarkable nature study film that left me in awe the first time I viewed it on PBS. How marvelous it must have been to experience walking amongst these beautiful creatures and learning how to not only communicate with them, but also to actually become one of their family!  It was heartbreaking to see how one of these wonderful Mule Deer was taken by a hunter's bullet after braving SO many struggles and challenges within nature herself, only to fall prey to man too early in life. When he was interviewed, the hunter asked the author here how old the deer might have been. The author knew exactly, having lived with and helping to raise the deer from birth. I believe this incident caused the author to give up his project because of the pain it caused him to see any of his adopted family dying such a terrible death. To those hunters who try and justify their killings by saying how many days or years they have tried to shoot one of these and that they will enjoy the meat, you are grossly wrong. With all the special equipment and tricks, plus high powered rifles with high powered scopes, it's not a sport at all; it's a killing spree. Why does a wild animal have to give up it's life so that you can brag about the kill and eat the meat? You aren't hungry and you aren't starving, so it cannot be justified any more than those that shot and killed all of the buffalo strictly for fun and sport, almost wiping out the entire species.",1398038400,11,1451,4.374074074074074

6255751,4,B00IAR2DJG,"A sweet and touching story of a scientist who specializes in living among and observing animals spending 7 years amidst a herd of mule deer. He gets to know them as individuals and slowly wins their trust. Its especially beguiling because the scientist, Joe Hutto, comes off more like a tough and flinty hunter who wed think would be out there shooting these deer, than the soft-hearted soul underneath who cant help shedding a tear when a favorite four legged friend passes on.

On the other hand, the film suffers from a serious lack of specific information. How did this deer die? How sick is that one? With what? How much does Joe feel he can ethically interfere when one is in trouble? Without more basic explanation of the rules of Joes research and the specifics of what were seeing (example  were told that the mule deer are under strain from all sides, but never told any more about what that means. Is the species actually in decline? Is it endangered? What are the specific threats from all sides? ) the film is doomed to remain a pleasant and heartwarming diversion, but not a serious look at the species or its situation.",1460419200,,1134,4.608910891089109

6255753,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Joe Hutto needs to be a vegan to make him authentic. The Mule Deer are awesome and it is  disgusting how humans kill them for no reason...except that they can. The deer have enough difficulty surviving from natural situations. Joe weeps over losing deer who he says show human emotions, but he hunts and is all for hunters while he is worried about the Mule Deer going extinct...this guy is one confused dude!!! I'm giving it 5 stars because the deer are awesome. Joe needs to do some serious self reflection.",1454803200,,509,4.593406593406593

6255783,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Another one of PBS Nature's best programs. If you loved Joe Hutto, the biologist, in his ""My Life as a Turkey"" Nature program, you must see this as well. I was captivated by the deer,,the Wyoming scenery and his vision of wildlife. Evidently, Joe Hutto is quite a musician, based on the Wikipedia article about him, and his guitar tunes in this video support that view. I recommend this Nature program highly to you.",1432166400,3,416,4.635135135135135

6255786,5,B00IAR2DJG,"I really enjoyed getting the inside scoop on how Deer react with those they trust, to see them react to lost tribe members, like humans do.  Animals seen on television programs aren't always seen this way...behind the scenes.  It took this guy and his camera crew a long time to put together this video.  They did a really good job of documenting the deer in their natural habitat.",1431129600,2,381,4.573529411764706

6255789,5,B00IAR2DJG,Wonderful amazing portrayal of one mans relationship with a herd of wild mule deer. I already had his documentary on his time spent with some wold turkry polts that he reared and spent over a year living with in the wild.

6255796,4,B00IAR2DJG,"Loved this. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is it leaves you hanging. He says ""Mule deer are in trouble"" but doesn't say why. Wyoming Game and Fish Department strives for a population of 564,150 mule deer, but the last statewide estimate was 374,400 and they are not recovering. Wyoming is deeply in bed with the extraction industries. One can't even imagine it until you see in in person. I have. To think this is not impacting the flora and fauna there is pure hubris.",1421798400,,479,4.517241379310345
6255797,5,B00IAR2DJG,Liked this one even better than Joe Huttos Living with wild turkeys.  He has a very different approach to studying wildlife and I appreciate it.,1420761600,2,144,4.76
6255798,5,B00IAR2DJG,Watched it a couple of times on PBS and plan to send it to my brother to watch.  Right now my neighbors have it to watch.,1417996800,2,121,3.6538461538461537
6255809,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Love Joe Hutto and his work!  He does an amazing job in this documentary.  I am a former hunter, now I only shoot pictures.  But I felt for Joe when one of his special friends met with untimely circumstances.  I wish I could meet this man.  He seems very fascinating and to have the patience and persistence and determination he had filming this, says a lot about a person,  Of course I love all the scenery and wildlife.  Check out his other documentary My Life as a Turkey. If you are a nature love like me, great DVD.  Buy it!",1413763200,2,529,4.22
6255810,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Joe Hutto, in writing about both mule deer and turkeys, spends countless hours living with them.  I don't know how he finds the time, but I 'm glad he does it.  With his experiences in the animal world -  hunter, guide, biologist, rancher/cowboy - he has plenty of credibility for his observations.",1410739200,2,298,4.6923076923076925

6255813,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Joe Hutto is a pioneering naturalist. Instead of a gun and paintbrush, like Audubon, he gains the trust of the critters he studies, giving them his night and day.  He'd roost in trees with turkeys, and hike through the woods. With mule deer, he gets so familiar and becomes so trusted that he once lay down with a pregnant doe, and felt the fawn moving in her belly.  I don't know if there is anything important about mule deer that the reader will not know when they have finished this.  Real men in the West should buy this book.  When they finish it, they'll put down their guns, and pick up their binoculars.

If you love animals, and own 10 books, this must be one of them.  Another, also by Joe Hutto, should be Illumination in the Flatwoods: A Season With The Wild Turkey.",1407715200,5,779,4.375

6255816,5,B00IAR2DJG,"This is an insightful, if difficult, film to watch. The tenderness, expression of emotions and fascinating science of observing nature up close are worth every minute. This is a lovely film, good as a learning tool and good movie-making. I am glad the story was told and the wisdom infused throughout the piece should be part of all classrooms as an instructional piece of the conflict between recreational management of nature and the need for protection and further understanding of natural processes and needs.",1404864000,2,513,5.119047619047619
6255817,5,B00IAR2DJG,"I caught the book at our library's new book section and read it first before I realized their was a video. I identified with Jot Hutto and his experiences. He does a fine effort of telling his story. I agree with the reviewers that this is an excellent film--however--as it is said, the book is much better. The book goes into greater detail on the events which the video, for lack of time, has to omit or condense, e.g. the story of the hunters toward the end of the video. The cinematography is wonderful and was not expected. I wish it was on blue-ray.",1404345600,,555,4.346153846153846
6255818,5,B00IAR2DJG,"Joe Hutto has dedicated seven years of his life to becoming a wild mule deer. Ordinarily, the deer herd would run from any human, but these keenly intelligent animals come to regard this stranger as one of their own. As he crosses the species divide, Jo Hutto taps into a new understanding of these elusive animals. That was the technical description of this DVD but the emotional description of this DVD should be, if you taught you have experienced love, affection and trust in the same caliber as Jo Hutto, the truth would be you ain't seen nothing yet. Having wild animals to trust you in their own environment is a rare scene although I have seen few.

The memories of this DVD will stay with you for long, long time. A touching DVD which should be shared with the loved ones. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1403913600,7,802,4.531034482758621

8640455,4,B00IAR2DJG,"Great Job!

Hutto does excellent work with this mule deer group and the film is very well-made. The shots of the mt. lions and wolves are amazing. My only complaint is that, at the end Hutto says, 'Something must be done to save these deer now, not ten years from now."" But he doesn't say what, exactly, should be done. Winter and predators are the mule deer's worst enemy and I'm all for thinning out the wolves and bears but I would have liked to hear what Hutto suggests to help the mule deer herd. Also, I would have appreciated it if Hutto pointed out that legal deer hunting raises a tremendous amount of money which enables fish & game departments to benefit the deer. Of course, I understand how he gets personally attached to ""his"" deer. So would I. But, the reality is that deer belong to the taxpayers. I wish he would have mentioned that.",1512086400,,850,4.414012738853503
