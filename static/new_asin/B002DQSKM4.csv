3912415,4,B002DQSKM4,"MCE's OUTLAWS & GUNSLINGERS is packed in a double-wide keep case that's able to accomodate a half-dozen DVDs. All five of these half-hour-plus programs are on a single disc stored in a black paper glassine-lined sleeve, and since there's no included liner notes, all that extra space is wasted.

This 2008 western history documentary series was produced by BCI/ECLIPSE (formerly Brentwood). Each chapter is a combination of re-enactments, movie clips and vintage art, photos and other media. An anonymous narrator reads from a simply-worded but well-written script. Expert commentary from these historians: Caroline Breneka, Deb and Tom Goodrich, Greg Michno, Larry O'Neal, John Rese and David Wolfe. Other participants, in order of appearance:

David Kennedy - Cody Firearms Museum curator; Bob Boze Bell - True West Magazine editor; Marc Ferguson - storyteller; Gary Chilcote - Patee House Museum director; Jim Sherer - Kansas Heritage Center director; Jared Chatterley - folklore expert; Steve Zimmer - storyteller; Davis Scism - Dalton Defenders Museum director; George Laughead Jr. - Ford County Historical Society director; Mary Kapko - Adams Museum & House, Deadwood.

3912417,4,B002DQSKM4,"I recommend this series.  It traces the history of the western gunslinger, why they existed, how they came into being the legends that they are, and also exposes some of the mythology..., exposing gangs like the James-Younger gang as cold blooded killers and not the heroic outlaws that they are sometimes portrayed as.  Including some excellent re-creations of scenes from the old west, from bank robberies to shoot outs in the street, you get an excellent history lesson into the backgrounds of some of the most famous outlaws. The entire 5 part documentary is on one dvd and works very well, audio and video were perfect.

3912427,5,B002DQSKM4,The purchase was a gift for a friend. And from my understanding he love the DVD. A lot of what's in the DVD has not been shown on television.,1391990400,,141,3.896551724137931
3912428,5,B002DQSKM4,"This is actually a 2 Disc set and has a total running time of 2 Hours and 20 seconds. It is an attempt by some of the many researchers,writers and historical associations to tell about the true story and characters known as the Wild West. To the best of their ability they try to present the real truth and leave out much of the legend,fiction,myth and nonsense that has become so much of what has been written and/or portrayed in films over the years.
 It explains how and why the lawlessness,gunslingers ,weapons, law and justice,etc.,of the Wild West actually came about as a result of the Civil War and the aftermath and reconstruction of it. There is an tremendous amount of information presented in the DVD and it outlines the significance of the most famous Outlaws and Lawmen. It does an excellent job of tying together all the events that took place,mainly from the time of the Civil War up to the end of the 1800's. It details what went on with the movement westward and the development of the west and the cattle ranches,range wars,mining boom towns,revenge of the South against Reconstruction by the Union or northern victors,wagon trains,buffalo hunters,Indian wars ,outlaws,gamblers,the U.S. Army,Pinkertons,train , stagecoach and bank robberies,hangings,shootouts,;and how all these things were interconnected. It sticks with facts and does not embellish events with all sorts of legends and colorful descriptions as does so much that has been written about the Wild West. This period was not long,actually less than about 30 years, and was very complicated;but this DVD does an excellent job of sorting it all out,and presents this history in a very easy to follow and in an orderly manner.
 Anyone who enjoys reading  or watching movies of the Wild West will find this a very informative resource .It will also be appreciarted by fans of Western fiction novels such as Longarm,The Trailsman,The Gunsmith,and many others where the nanmes of the characters,events,and so forth are continually creeping up in these novels.",1384041600,,2036,5.071641791044776
3912429,3,B002DQSKM4,"For a very small investment,you get a more than average effort. The western from it's beginnings as the 19th century dime novels;,to the movies of the twentieth century, has always had an element of myth attached to it. With this caveat in mind,one can always find something to like in videos of this genre. Historians,buffs and western fans alike can find the subject interesting,because the element of the tall tale by it's very nature is just plain fun. The facts are in dispute today, more than a century later. The myth renews itself with different interpretations that more reflect the values of a particular generation looking at the West. There were a few questionable facts, but that goes with the genre. For a small investment, one is transported to a world with few black or white;and a lot of gray. A few hours of diversion and fun is worth the price.",1383955200,2,863,4.7218543046357615

3912431,4,B002DQSKM4,"I am a big western buff particularly regarding the Battle of the OK Corral in Tombstone, AZ between the Clantons and the Earps. This was one of the most documented gun shootings in history much less of the American Wild West and I have watched movie after movie on this subject including Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, and Hour of the Gun. I've been looking for a decent documentary story of what happened at the Battle of the OK Corral, and this dvd does the story justice with both good storytelling and good historical facts. Just the story on the Battle of the OK Corral made this dvd worth getting.",1359331200,3,595,4.518518518518518
3912432,4,B002DQSKM4,"This is by far one of the best documentary series that Mill Creek Entertainment has ever produced. Over the years they produced some amazing documentaries ( America's 60 Greatest Unsolved Mysteries and Crimes, Vegas: The City the Mob made ), and OUTLAWS & GUNSLINGERS is one of them. Produced by award-winning production company Centre Communications, this series serves as a follow-up to their smash hit ""The Great Indian Wars 1540 - 1890"". This is the story of the West as it has never been told before...Myth and legend stripped away and the truth revealed by 17 of the nation's top Western authorities. Learn the truth about Billy The Kid, Jesse James, Wild Bill Hickok and many more. I'm a History buff, I just really enjoy watching documentaries about History, other eras, other times. To me it's a passion. Recently I discovered that I have a huge interest for the Wild West, stories of Cowboys and Outlaws, Billy the Kid, Jesse James and his gang. Fascinating stuff. Very fascinating. I bought this DVD last week, and I wasn't disappointed by it.

Everything about this documentary series is great. The amount of information given to us is impressing, I've learned a lot while watching these 5 episodes. So many fascinating events or characters are covered: Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, how the Wild West begun, the evolution of guns and firearms, the gunfight at OK Corral, towns like Tombstone and Deadwood, the origin of the lawmen, The Civil War, Samuel Colt, John Coffee Hays, Samuel Hamilton Walker, history of the Texas Rangers, The Guerillas, William Quantrill, Allen Pinkerton, Boomtowns, and so much more. Very impressive list. The narrator is great, his voice is perfect for the documentary.

Other things I like about this documentary: First they don't use a lot of footage from old western movies. Mill Creek have the reputation of filling their documentaris with footage from old movies, this is not the case for this documentary, I was very happy to see that the use of such footage is very limited. Also the number of people interviewed for this series is impressing; over 15 western historians were interviewed for this documentary, a lot more than most series produced by Mill Creek. All of them obviously knows what they're talking about and all of them are interesting. So this series is in 5 parts, for a total of 3 hours. The episodes you'll find on this DVD are:

1. ORIGINS OF THE GUNSLINGER ( 31 minutes )
2. JESSE JAMES & THE SOUTHERN GUERILLAS ( 38 minutes )
3. BILLY THE KID & THE LONE OUTLAWS ( 41 minutes )
4. WILD BILL HICKOK & THE LAWMEN ( 38 minutes )
5. WYATT EARP & THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL ( 38 minutes )

The reason why I'm giving this product 4 stars is because of the lenght, 3 hours is a little short for me. Usually most documentaries released by Mill Creek are between 6 and 8 hours long, sometimes more, and it's difficult to understand how this series is only 3 hours long when they have interviewed more than a dozen experts and when there's so many topics to cover. This is the only disappointment I had with this DVD, when it was over I wanted more, this is how great this DVD is. Plus I bought it for less than 5$, brand new here on Amazon, that's one hell of a great deal. So there you have it folks, I think this DVD is a great addition to any collection, to any library. If, like me, you have a huge passion for History and Historical documentaries then you need to add this series to your collection. :)",1336694400,7,3507,4.597444089456869

3912434,2,B002DQSKM4,"This video series is extremely boring and does not even approach the excitement of other series on the West, such as the outstanding A&E series, The Real West, narrated by Kenny Rogers.  The monotone narration adds to the assorted problems with the series, not the least of which are (1) it unapologetically uses extensive clips from old Westerns and (2) it is shot in video instead of film, leaving a uninspiring, one-dimension aspect to the videos. Don't waste your money!",1311552000,2,474,4.925
8365837,5,B002DQSKM4,"If you're just a causal fan of this period in American history, this dvd is not for you. Mill Creek Entertainment has, once again, put together another  excellent  product. This program is an in-depth, detail-oriented documentary of the people and events which made up the ""Wild West"". The usual recognizable characters and events are included (ie Billy The Kid, Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, Gunfight At The OK Corral etc) as well as some lesser-known but relevant people and events which contributed to the development of this period. The chapters are explained with excellent narration, story-telling, reenactments, and photos. Each segment moves along in a very interesting and informative pace. Highly recommended for the viewer seeking both entertainment and some enlightenment about the post Civil War period in our country's history.
