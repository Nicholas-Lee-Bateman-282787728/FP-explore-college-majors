8719601,5,B00Z8067Q8,This is a great product. I use this video as a home exercise program for my patients. The website has forms that you can fill out to personalize the program for your patient. I actually had a family member call me recently to tell me how her father was practicing his swallow exercises with the video everyday and doing great. Highly recommended!,1462320000,2,346,4.596774193548387

Be sure to download the FREE resources on the website too! Because of Amazon video, it is accessible from every device I own (Roku, ipad, phone, and computer). Perfect for therapy!",1445558400,2,336,4.711864406779661
