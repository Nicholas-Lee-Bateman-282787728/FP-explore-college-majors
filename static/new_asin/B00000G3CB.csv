1214920,4,B00000G3CB,"Although all of his tapes are excellent, I particularly like this two tape set.  The first one, ""Tonin' Uptown"" is for your upper body, and the ""Tonin' Downtown"" is for...you guessed it, your lower body.  The tapes run around 30-40 minutes each and are easy enough for a beginner to do.  The music keeps you moving and let's face it...Richard Simmons is just pretty darn motivational!  It's hard not to give the exercise routine your best effort, even though he's just on tape!  Be forwarned--the toning rings are NOT included with the videos, but you can easily buy them at many discount stores.  The students in his class could be you and me...they aren't all drop-dead gorgeous looking models, and I appreciate that.  Instead of sitting at the computer, why don't you order this tape and get busy toning with Richard??",996710400,12,821,4.780141843971631
1214921,4,B00000G3CB,"These are two great routines. One word of caution though, it's a good idea  to learn correct form from other instructors. You could hurt yourself if  your wrists, shoulders, and knees aren't in the right position at the right  time. Other than that, these are fun routines and provide thorough toning.  I'm sorry to hear that the rings aren't included, but you can get them  through Richard's site as well as heavier rings, to which I just graduated.  The best part about the rings is that they're easy to travel with. Once you  have the routines down, you can use the rings anywhere to keep toned.",965001600,14,598,4.584905660377358
1214922,5,B00000G3CB,"This is a really fun toning video.  It has great music, fun sets and is really motivating.  It is divided into two sections.  Tonin' Uptown is an upper body workout and Tonin' Downtown is lower body and abs.  Each section  is about half an hour with its own warm up and cool down so you can just do  half if that's all you have time for.  This is a good video for a beginner  or intermediate exerciser.  Someone really fit would not find it very  challening at all.  My only complaint is that the toning rings could be a  little bit sturdier.  Mine are showing a lot of wear from so much use.",952387200,18,592,4.132743362831858

7908847,2,B00000G3CB,"I really didn't need the video, I needed the toning bands.  Since my original came with them I assumed they would come with this one too.  When the package came it was only the video and not the bands.  It surprised me because it was supposed to be new.  Had I known it would just be the video I wouldn't have bothered ordering it.  The company that sold the video very graciously gave me a credit for the video and told me not to return it which was very nice of them.",1253577600,,469,4.054347826086956
7908848,3,B00000G3CB,"I like Richard Simmons and his videos and DVDs.  This one is no exception.  It is upbeat, fun and the songs are great.  Working with the rings was different and fun.  I enjoyed it, but I didn't feel I was getting the workout I wanted/needed.  Of the two sessions, I thought Downtown was harder, though maybe that's because my legs are in worse shape than my upper body.  After using this for a couple of months I felt like I wasn't making the progress that I wanted.  So I went searching for something more difficult.  I figure that as long as I'm taking the time to exercise, it should make a difference.  I recommend the following two DVDs for good strength training workouts:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped-with-Jari-Love-Slim-Lean/dp/B000FBFUEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Slim & Lean</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trainer-s-Edge-Integrated-Strength-Training/dp/B000GNOH6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trainer's Edge: Integrated Strength Training</a>&nbsp;I recommend Tonin' Uptown and Tonin' Downtown for people just starting out.  Unfortunately, this only comes on VHS.  It's too bad Richard hasn't updated some of his older stuff to DVD format.",1186444800,,1297,6.482558139534884
