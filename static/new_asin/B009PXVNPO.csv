8543679,5,B009PXVNPO,"Short and sweet. Murakumo Keiko (in the Japanese rendition) is a gentle, graceful and cheerful host. She survived cancer by undergoing surgery, and then a major overhaul of her life. She tells her story here: https://www.amazon.com/Qigong-Rejuvenation-Diet-Breathing-Movements/dp/1434379000/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1481816389&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=keiko+murakumo

Keiko-sensei went to China to study QiGong (chee-gong), the ancient Chinese art of ""breath (or energy) exercise"". QiGong is the sibling to TaiJi. Her book explains the energy systems within our bodies and discusses diet, and illustrates the movements of QiGong. This video enables you to practice with her.

Finally, I am happy that the price has come down to a reasonable level for a DVD that is only about 23 minutes long.",1481760000,,798,6.3119266055045875
8543680,4,B009PXVNPO,"This video enables a gentle preparation before doing work in full tai chi or qigong session...I also found it good for me when I had been recovering from an illness and was weak.  This is a subtle training video, more perhaps a ""moving meditation"" that can help center your energy without use of muscular stress. Also would recommend as entry point for long time inactive people, elderly, injured, or otherwise ailing persons.",1402617600,,426,4.916666666666667
8543681,3,B009PXVNPO,"For such a short video with only 3 movements offered, video is way over-priced.  The warm-ups are commonly known so there was very little to be gained by purchasing this video.",1401148800,,176,4.67741935483871
