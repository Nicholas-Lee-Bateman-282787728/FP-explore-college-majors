8251631,1,B00000IOUU,This is NOT the excellent Gregory Hines movie of the same title! A previous reviewer is misleading readers into believing it is! This is a horrible movie that has poor acting and unintentionally funny fight scenes.,1092268800,3,214,4.972222222222222
8251632,3,B00000IOUU,"This'll be short and sweet.
The late, great Gregory Hines plays a government agent tasked with tracking down and neutralizing an android that unbeknownst to him packs a nuclear payload as a last-ditch defense mechanism.  Fine action scenes and some funny lines from Mr. Hines make this a fun movie to have--I have no problems with it at all along those lines...BUT:
Who in their demented mind designed the DVD cover art for this edition's release? There's NO hint at all of a biological storyline in the film...what's with the person in a gasmask on the front?  Also, the tagline at the bottom about predicting an Al-Qaeda attack on NYC three years before it happened is PLAIN AND SIMPLE BAD TASTE (aside from also being untrue). Whoever thought re-vamping the original box art (with Hines and an image of the android on it) to this lame attempt to make buyers think the movie has 9-11 relevance should be FIRED.  It's one thing to grossly misrepresent the content of your product, it's entirely another thing when you go so far as to try and use an international tragedy as an eye-catcher to make money.  As an EMT and Red Cross rescue worker, I personally take offense to this, and whereas I used to be looking forward to owning this DVD, I will now be most happy to hang onto my old video copy--I urge anyone with a conscience to do the same.
Movie:  thumbs-up
Everything else about the packaging: SHAME ON YOU.",1077062400,,1414,4.617529880478088
8251633,1,B00000IOUU,"i order this movie used, and the shipment was so fast. after i have seen the film, i can see why.. the seller must have been so happy to get rid of it, and i'm the sucker who recieved it!
alright, look.. i shouldnt even comment this movie, it isn't worth it. but.. it's so bad that i just got to tell you.. okey, first of all, you're supose to believe that George Lazenby (james bond back in 1969) and Linda Gray (Sue Ellen in Dallas) are the main stars of this movie.
haha.. Well, Lazenby shows up in the end of the film, to do a couple of short scenes before he gets shot. and Linda Gray is hardly seen either.
The acting, the camera work, the whole movie.. it's so bad that you will look down in shame. and find yourself in enbaressment for watching this.. i feelt silly. i never feelt like that for watching a movie before. ive seen some bad movies, but this is like no other.. and i feel bad for Lazenby and Gray who are in this mess - i know they aren't very big stars, but this movie is like.. look, I wouldnt even accept a role here.
you will pity for the other actors in this movie.. you will feel sorry for them.. this movie has got the worst actors ever.. everything is bad. and what's up with the sound? was it dubbed? i mean, the mouth talk doesnt time with the sound. their lips starts to move before the sound, haha.. nothing goes right in this film. if i can even call it that! i think the sound is put on afterwards.
i thought, maybe a 10 year old would think this was cool, but even that won't work, its too much blood and violence for kids.. look, it feels like Lazenby and Gray are the parents to a couple of kids who did this movie in their backyard. and lazenby said ""okey, i guess i can come out for 10 minutes and be in your little movie"".
i mean, Lazenby and Gray are so superior compared to the other actors, and the rest of the film.. i cant understand how they agreed to be in this!
has anyone besides me even seen this??? i'm just.. i'm.. i'm shocked about how bad this is.. it's like lazenby and linda gray tapped the film makers and other actors on the shoulder and said ""it's alright, kids.. don't be ashamed, it isn't that bad""
i recomend you watch this, just for the fun of it. you won't believe it. youve never seen anything like this.. i try to describe how bad it is, but there just isn't any way.. you have to see it.
i imagen the movie like this: a bunch of kids wanted to do a cool film, and lazenby and gray are the parents who agreed to join in the game.
i kinda like lazenby and gray, even though i lost some respect for them sence they're a part of this film. oh my god.. anyone who gives this movie over lowest star, should be arrested. then get in touch with a doctor. holy sh... i feel sorry for the mail man who had to deliever this!",1076976000,4,2781,4.076642335766423
