8130582,3,B000GC79E2,"Arbol is a superbly creative musical group produced by the great Argentine rocker-producer Gustavo Santaollala. He is the producer behind Cafe Tacuba, & I am certain that he saw a lot of what he liked in that group when he went to work with this Argentine group.
But before I go that far since this is not an in-depth review of this concert video,  I want to state my major annoyance from beginning to end with this DVD.  It seems to be more interested in the audience than the talent of any of these musicians. It's like going to see a great guitarist & being forced to look at the head & hear the screams of an adoring fan sitting in front of you drowning out every note. One can tell that the group is bathing in the attention,  but I came (via DVD) to see & hear them.  My ticket price, eagerly spent,  was this DVD. Darn!
Nevertheless, if you love the group, yep here they are.  The video & audio quality is pretty good, I was just looking for something different.  I hope that Arbol gets another chance (with better direction) to present themselves via video with a DVD that allows me to spend time with the group.
Meanwhile,  if you are new to Arbol I highly suggest the purchase of the audio CD ""Chapusongs"" which is brilliant & original,  and you can actually hear the group performing.  It deserves the title 'Best of the Best' & showcases the astounding potential of these musicians.",1344816000,,1394,4.41015625
