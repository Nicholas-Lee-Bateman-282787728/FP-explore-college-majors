2754911,4,B000N3T0G4,"The biggest shortcoming with this collection is the inclusion of the 1936 film ""The Texas Rangers.""  A big hit in its day, it has not weathered the years at all well. It was Fred MacMurray's first western and he looks decidedly uncomfortable - especially in his scenes with the irritating Jack Oakie. Universal would have done better to use the 1949 remake
entitled ""Streets of Laredo"" with William Holden and William Bendix playing the same parts and making it all believable. ( Don't pay any attention to Leonard Maltin's put-down of ""Laredo"" - it's ten times better than ""The Texas Rangers"" and it's in technicolor too ). The Audie Murphy film ""Kansas Raiders"" is adequate western fare and the Rock Hudson first starring role ""The Lawless Breed"" is a very solid piece of story telling, but it's Jacques Tourneur's expertly crafted 1946 western ""Canyon Passage"" that makes this release worthwhile. Beautifully photographed, well-written and perfectly performed by an excellent cast, it's everything a western should be. Dana Andrews is a believable hero with certain character flaws such as stubborness, Susan Hayward is an attractive female lead who can't seem to make up her mind which man she really wants and Brian Donlevy manages to be both likeable and villainous at the same time as a weak willed gambler. And Ward Bond is a magnificent town bully.  I would have paid the price just to get this film on its own. If Universal had given us ""Streets of Laredo"" instead of ""The Texas Rangers"" I would have given this a full five-star rating.",1247702400,11,1546,4.896946564885496
2754912,5,B000N3T0G4,"""Canyon Passage"" with Dana Andrews, Susan Hayward, Brian Donlevy, and Hoagy Carmichael is the best movie in this set and is good enough to make this set a worthwhile purchase.  ""Canyon Passage"" was filmed in the Diamond Lake area of Oregon and has wonderful scenery featuring Mt. Thielson as the background in many of the scenes.  Mt. Thielson is a sharply pointed peak just north of Crater Lake National Park and Crater Lake is briefly seen in the background as Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward ride past it.  The story is interesting and well written and the acting is believable by all the actors which includes Ward Bond and a young Lloyd Bridges.  The addition of Hoagy Carmichael singing his songs during the film, especially ""Ol' Buttermilk Sky"", make this a classic western which should have been released separately but at least it is now available on DVD.",1189036800,19,863,4.8108108108108105
2754913,2,B000N3T0G4,"Director Jacques Tourneur is probably most fanous for ""Cat People"" and ""Out of the Past,"" with most of his other work ranging from mediocre to downright B-movie making.  ""Canyon Passage"" is a fairly sluggish western set on Oregon, whose natural beauty is the real star of this film.  The 1946 Technicolor process is astoundingly rich and most of the movie is filmed outside, against mountains, lakes, forests, meadows, and farmland.  The story is flimsy, involving hionest-to-a-fault Dana Andrews taking care of wastrel Brian Donleavy because Andrews harbors a distant love for Donleavy's fiancee, Susan Hayworth. There is a very violent fistfight in a bar, precursor to the famous one in ""Shane,"" and the Indians' burning of settlers homes is terrifying. Beyond that no one distinguishes himself, least of all Hogey Carmichael who seems to have composed the ditties he sings on the spot (the exception being the tag at the end, ""Old Buttermilk Sky.""",1188086400,5,950,5.1558441558441555

The Texas Rangers is one of those movie that was made over call The Streets of Lorado with William Holden thats no longer available/Kansas Raiders is Audie Murphy at his best. I also was suprise to see Tony Curtis in a western, A must see movie for all western fans.

2754915,4,B000N3T0G4,"Well going in I had high hopes based on earlier reviews concerning Canyon Passage. That turned out to be a pretty good old style western. If all of the other movies had the same standard then the disk would have been rated 5 stars. The others are good but not as good as CP and that is what brought it down. All of the fils were pretty well played, good plot development and any fan of the old stuff should like this collection.",1183248000,7,428,4.168674698795181
2754916,4,B000N3T0G4,"Fine picture of mostly non-violent pioneers in the Pacific Northwest.  A loyal rendering of Ernest Haycox's novel.  Dana Andrews stalwart as Logan, the shopkeeper, Susan Hayward as sweet and loyal Lucy, Brian Aherne as Lucy's fiancee, with a problem with gambling.  Hoagy Carmichael is a townsman, who introduced his theme song ""Old Buttermilk Sky,""  Lloyd Bridges a gold prospector, Ward Bond a sweaty ruffian.  One for kids to see it wasn't all saloons and gunmen who settled the West.",1179705600,5,487,5.113924050632911
2754917,5,B000N3T0G4,"This is volume I of the two volume set of Classic Westerns to be issued by Universal, and it includes four excellent oaters, and if past history is any guide, Universal will give us great transfers in excellent color (where the movies are in color). Fred MacMurray (THE TEXAS RANGERS) was an accomplished Western actor, with not only THE TEXAS RANGERS to his credit but classics such as AT GUNPOINT, GUN FOR A COWARD, GOOD DAY FOR A HANGING, QUANTEZ, and others demonstrating his prowess in the genre. He doesn't disappoint here. CANYON PASSAGE was one of Dana Andrews finest roles, and it's a excellent picture, with Hoagy Carmichael providing some delightful music. Audie Murphy stars in KANSAS RAIDERS, and doesn't disappoint (his legion of fans will be delighted!). Finally, Rock Hudson, again a fine Westerner, is very fine in THE LAWLESS BREED. In sum, four very fine and entertaining Westerns, which, along with volume II, should please Western fans and movie viewers in general.",1171497600,45,986,4.9818181818181815

2754955,5,B000N3T0G4,"The Texas Rangers is a bad guy turned good guy movie,with Fred MacMurray(My Three Sons)  as the lead bad guy. *****Spoiler Alert*** It opens with three friends who hold up stages, one of whom drives the stagecoach. When they get separated, two of them go one way, and the third a different way. The two end up joining the Texas Rangers for nefarious reasons, but soon they come to like being a part of the rangers. Eventually, one falls in love and decides to continue doing the right thing. Inevitably, there is a showdown between the bad guy who got away and the now good guy's (Macmurray) character.  This was a classic western in the classic good guy, bad guy form.*** I highly enjoyed this story.

Canyon Passage is another really good movie in this set. There is the music of Hoagy Carmichael as well. This movie takes place in Oregon, a place with a lot of trees, which provide an excellent background for the story. The main character is a business owner who constantly wants to be on the go, played by Dana Andrews. There is romance, Indian fights, almost a lynching, and well just a great story. My only problem with this story is that I never did figure out what exactly the story was about. By that I mean that I was never sure if they wanted to do a romance, an Indian war, a story about a business man, or settlers. All in all, though I did not figure it out, I sure did enjoy it.

Kansas Raiders is a great entry into the set,it's about a group of young familiar outlaws who have not yet turned outlaw, who join up with Quantril's Raiders. Now, I know what you are thinking, not another Quantril's Raiders movie, but this one is really well done. It stars Audie Murphy, Richard Long (nanny and the professor and Big Valley), along with many others. I highly recommend it. For the price of the set, it's worth it just for this movie alone in my opinion.

The Lawless Breed stars Rock Hudson as John Wesley Hardin. This is supposed to be based on a book (an autobiography) that Hardin wrote himself, about himself while in prison. As to the accuracy, well only Hardin himself would know. The movie is told from Hardin's viewpoint and portrays him as a man who only killed in self defense. The movie gives us the two women who loved Hardin and the price they paid for that love. We also get a look into Hardin's family life,and  his father the preacher who disciplined with a whip. All in all it's a very good movie, Rock Hudson is a perfect fit for the Hardin character he portrays.

Overall I would say this is a set well worth the price if you like westerns. I know I do.

2754974,5,B000N3T0G4,"The four movies on this set are the old-style of westerns that I find most enjoyable.  They are made with good story lines, good production values, and excellent casts and direction.  All four movies are recommended.

""Canyon Passage"" - One of the most beautifully-filmed westerns ever made.  Made on location in the spectacular scenery of Oregon.  Beautiful Technicolor.  Dana Andrews is the believable star and Ward Bond is the really evil bad guy. Susan Hayward does well and never looked better.  Brian Donlevy, always good, here plays a likeable but fallible gambling addict.  Hoagy Carmichael is really enjoyable as a sort of a wandering minstrel character, and sings his Academy Award-winning composition, ""Ole Buttermilk Sky"".  If you enjoy good, solid westerns with beautiful Technicolor photography this is possibly the ideal western for you.  This 1946 movie is the reason I bought this set.

""The Lawless Breed"" - Rock Hudson does an excellent job in this highly sanitized biography of John Wesley Hardin, possibly the worst killer in the old west.  Julie Adams has a great role.  This movie surprised me as to how good it is.

""Kansas Raiders"" - An early (1950) Audie Murphy action western.  Audie plays Jesse James but with a conscience.  Really! Highly fictionalized. Brian Donlevy is the notorious Quantrill, an evil character of so many older westerns. Tony Curtis is in an early role. A typical drawback I notice about so many westerns is that, whereas this is supposed to take place in Missouri and Kansas, the filmmakers chose to film the movie midst all the rocks, mountains, and forests of California.  You're not supposed to notice those details but I always do.

The Texas Rangers"" -  This 1936 western was a surprise to me.  Fred MacMurray in a good action western.  Excellent story and production values.  One drawback, for me, is the overdone ebulliance of Jack Oakie which is a bit much at times.  A pleasant surprise was a cameo by Gabby Hayes as the judge; and another cameo by the great bad guy, Fred Kohler. Very enjoyable movie.

You cannot go wrong with this set.",1322870400,5,2097,4.908831908831909
2754975,5,B000N3T0G4,"All four films here are worth seeing but ""Canyon Passage"" is the standout. It's a thoughtful, character-driven film with good actors and an engaging story and certainly not without its share of warmth and humor. I wanted to see it simply because Hoagy Carmichael's in it, albeit in a minor role. But I've simply taking a liking to the film as a whole. To me, it's a gem.

Fred McMurray in ""Texas Rangers"", Rock Hudson in ""The Lawless Breed"" and Audie Murphy in ""Kansas Raiders"" are all quite good in their roles. There's not a dud film in this collection. These are not typical oaters. They lean more toward introspection than shoot-em-up fare though that element is present as well.

A great round-up and recommended.",1294358400,2,718,4.736
