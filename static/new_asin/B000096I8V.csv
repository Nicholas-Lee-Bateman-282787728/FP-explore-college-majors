7989803,5,B000096I8V,"I purchased this on the strength of the reviews.  However, upon arrival, the description on the cover does not do the topic justice.  The cover describes this as a rehash of Eva Braun's home movies, but the film was an excellent interview session of the last remaining personal staff who were there back in the day and knew them combined with Eva's home movie footage and history.  There is some sensationalism of the early awkward relationship between Hitler and Geli Raubal (did he or didn't he -- we'll never know -- have sex and a love affair with his half neice? People did that with such consanguinity back then).  In this examination on film, the Eva relationship with Hitler is clearly and credibly portrayed as normal and deep through the last remaining first hand witness persons interviewed.  The point of view is of objective observer from serious historians such as Gitty Sereny who is undoubtedly objective.  Most people today would pray that they had a love relationship as deep as that of Eva and Adolf.  It's a shame that their correspondence was destroyed by their family and adjutants upon their orders/wishes.",1418256000,,1129,4.87958115183246

7989806,5,B000096I8V,"Written and directed by Marion Milne and nicely narrated by Michael Kitchen, who stars in Foyle's war, this 2001 documentary treats the relationship between Adolf Hitler (20 Apr. 1889-30 Apr. 1945) and his mistress Eva Braun (6 Feb. 1912-30 Apr. 1945), who married two days before they committed suicide in their Berlin bunker. The documentary (TT49:10, 4:3 aspect) is excellent and is mostly in color, consisting of color and especially B&W newsreel footage and portraits, Eva Braun's famous color home movies, dramatizations that are occasionally overwrought, and informative interviews. Interviewed are authoress Gitta Sereny (Albert Speer, 1995), Hitler's housekeeper, his SS bodyguard, Braun's housemaid, and her cousin. Not interviewed is Hitler's stenographer, Traudl Junge (1920-2002), who recently appeared in Blind spot (2002) as well as in World at war (1973-74). Adolf & Eva also has readings from Hitler's speeches and writings and from Braun's 1935 diary, The video quality is very good to excellent, including of the newsreel footage and, significantly, of Braun's home movies. This DVD is far superior to another DVD, Eva Braun: Hitler's mistress (2005?), which I reviewed elsewhere.",1166054400,3,1199,5.593406593406593

7989808,5,B000096I8V,A fascinating portrait of Adolf and his otherwise little-known mistress Eva Braun.  The content was interesting; I liked the orginal film footage provided of the two; a very thorough documentary.,1124236800,8,195,5.5
7989809,2,B000096I8V,"It's both bizarre and a little bit scary to see such a sympathetic prortrait of Hitler these days. Watching it does help you to understand what Hannah Arendt meant went she spoke of ""the banality of evil"", but it also makes you wonder how the producers could make a film that portrayed Hitler with none of the context of the world he tried to create. Scary.",1080172800,,357,4.424242424242424
7989810,4,B000096I8V,"I admit I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this DVD, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you've seen the color home movies of Eva Braun, then much of the material here will not be new to you. But the quality of Eva's movies varies, and this program uses high-quality, non-grainy footage, which added to its appeal. There are also some interviews with Hitler intimates through the years. They say nothing new, but their inclusion strengthens the overall effect. There are some questionable recreations here using actors, and they mis-identify Gretl Braun (Eva's sister) as Eva several times. I would have liked to have seen modern footage of the various Munich haunts of Hitler and Eva. But for the price, this is quite a good look at the relationship between the Fuehrer and his mistress.",1078531200,39,791,4.866666666666666
