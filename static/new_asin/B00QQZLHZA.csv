Very hot girl and lots of blood, one thing that really stand out is the fact that main character in this production has such a great acting talent, he reminded me of Jack Nicholson in movie Shining. So much potential for him to be in a hollywood production movie. Totally recommended and enjoy it from beginning to end!!",1433289600,,391,4.6
