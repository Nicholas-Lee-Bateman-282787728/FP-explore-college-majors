6382233,5,B00JOWHSIW,What can I say about Jason Momoa' s directorial debut. The storyline was interesting. He plays a Mojave Indian whose mother is raped and killed by a white man and the rapist is set free. Wes Studi plays his father. Wolf (Jason)  wants to take his mother's ashes to a sacred lake. The story continues from there.,1404777600,3,311,4.456140350877193
6382234,5,B00JOWHSIW,"It was very good. A great road movie. The characters were very endearing. I really loved the music choices ... All around, I enjoyed it a lot!",1404518400,6,142,4.296296296296297
6382235,4,B00JOWHSIW,"this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie , as follows-
movie - 4 / 5
video - 3.5 / 5
audio - 4 / 5

gritty slow moving drama about a man on the run from the law, taking his dead mother's
ashes to her final resting place.
could have been so much better with that little extra push.
video was ok in some scenes, the color palette is limited at best;  blacks, and browns dominate the transfer, and even brighter objects appears terribly faded but intentionally so.
it's just not a movie made with visual flash or sharp clarity and bold colors in mind.",1404345600,2,555,4.08256880733945

6382254,5,B00JOWHSIW,"It was made to be a piece of art. Directed with a clear desire to cause feeling but bring back the good old days where movies could mean something and simply be beautiful without having to be over the top. Jason Momoa was a great lead actor but maybe even a better director. Not for everyone but if you want a movie with beautifully simple scenes, a lot of heart, and a genius soundtrack, I would recommend Road to Paloma.",1481587200,,422,4.2875

And I absolutely DON'T rely on critics to tell me what to watch, read, think ... you get them gist. So ... the fact that my fingers are poised above my keyboard, penning a review for Road to Paloma, surprises even me. It was good. It was REAL good. I could tell you how deep the plot was. How real the characters were. How emotional the journey was. I could tell you all that. But I won't. I'll simply tell you to watch it. See for yourself.

6382303,4,B00JOWHSIW,"This was an incredible movie. It's hard to believe it's a directorial debut! The people who gave this movie ONE STAR are most likely 'Sons of Anarchy' groupies obsessed with the ridiculous plots of the show. Sorry people, but Sons of Anarchy is a bunch of bs sex and violence to get ratings from mindless fools, it's not real, so get over it. This movie is a drama, NOT an action. The only thing that sucked about this movie was the abrupt ending that leaves you hanging. Story could've been just a bit more developed, like showing the scene of him taking revenge. Or maybe some flashbacks with the mother, something like that. Other than that, this movie was wonderful. Good direction, good cast, good story, AWESOME TUNES, amazing scenery, just excellent. Even has some funny parts. His buddy is too funny. Like I said, if you liked Thunderheart, you'll probably enjoy this film, so give it a watch.",1433980800,2,901,4.672955974842767

6382329,3,B00JOWHSIW,"This a first attempt at Directing for the star Jason Momoa.
I like action movies but found this a little slow , and repetitive . The majority of the action was watching two guys ride motocycles.
I feel I would have been more engaged if the movie had begun with either of the two crimes that fuel this story.
It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I did catch myself yawning and looking at the clock.
I give it three stars as a good first attempt.
I know die hard Jason Momoa fans will disagree.
My suggestion is to wait for it on nonpayment channels.",1428105600,,551,4.2075471698113205

Well played out, especially considering they only got about an hour and a half to tell the story.  I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but I feel a lot of Native American culture comes off as cliche or cheesy on film; I didn't get that at all watching this film.

An improvement I would suggest would be to show some of the family's life, especially with the mother, before she died.  It would help the viewer feel more connected to the story.  The FBI agent was a little too over the top.",1416182400,9,600,4.256637168141593

I was crying like a maniac in the end. Would I be as dedicated to my family as some of these characters?

The man is flawless and along the way he has adventures and picks up a new bud in the form of Robert Homer Mollohan, who is also running on perfect. The end had to happen once the mad dog of a government cop got involved.  the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was one or two draggy parts (but it is really just a story so that had to happen) and the requisite evil ""I will do anything to get the maybe bad guy"" government cop.

6382387,4,B00JOWHSIW,"ROAD TO PALOMA

As a big fan of the WWE I have to support everything they do so naturally I watch all of their films. This is one of those films that WWE had nothing to do with making as they are the distributor. But that is fine since I would have seen this any way since I like the actor who stared/wrote/produced/directed. That of course is Jason Momoa who most will know from TV shows like Stargate Atlantis and Game of Thrones. So I would have gotten this anyway since I like both of those shows.

Momoa plays Wolf, a man on the run after murdering the man that killed his mother. He took the law into his own hands after the system did not work out the way he felt it should have. Yet even though this is a film about a man on the run it actually feels more like a road film because of the heart it has. The lawmen who are after him almost seem secondary to the buddy flick that plays out as Wolf and new biker buddy Cash [Robert Mollohan] head to Wolfs sisters place to retrieve his mothers ashes and spread them. It is that story and relationship that really take the lead here.

In all honesty this film could have just been about these twos journey and it would have been just as good. But with that said I did like the officers after him and how it all plays out in the end. In fact I really did like the ending to this flick. Momoa, Mollohan and fellow writer Jonathan Hirschbein did a really good job with this film. The heart in the film is subtle but it plays out nicely that way. Speaking of playing out nicely the cinematography from Brian Mendoza is beautiful. The shots, flow and lighting of this film are definitely a highlight.

Acting wise I did like it as everyone did a good enough job with their roles, some better than others. Plus it was cool to see Lance Henriksen; well it is always cool to see him. Momoa and Mollohan are great together and make for a good screen team. Also the officers after them are good and often funny the way they play off of each other. Everyone else is good in their roles which is a plus for the film.

The sole special feature we get is a deleted scene called The Hunt which is a shame because I would have loved a commentary from the three writers or at least Momoa and Mollohan. But it would have also been cool to hear Mendoza on a commentary as well or a behind the scenes making of or something. Over all I do recommend this to anyone looking for a flick to just sit back and watch.",1410739200,,2444,4.147679324894515

6382397,3,B00JOWHSIW,"This is a picture people love because of the anti-legal system message and not because of the acting. The story centers on Robert Wolf (Jason Momoa) a Native American in need of a bath. He is on the run from the law on a bike that requires Wolf to also be a mechanic. Wolf brutally killed Charles Grisby (Charlie Brumbly) who raped and killed his mother (neither event shown). Wolf feels Grisby wasn't punished enough and enacted his own justice system, one most people agreed with as he is aided and abetted by everyone he meets. Wolf's noble goal is to scatter his mother's ashes in a proper Mohave ceremony. Along the way he tangos up with Cash (Robert Homer Mollohan) making this film look like a remake of Easy Rider.

In a subplot, Wolf is pursued by two unrealistic federal agents who are 1-2 steps behind him.

The film utilizes independent tough guy, pro-libertarian, pro-anarchist, anti-government themes and similar hokey dialogue to drive home the point that the justice system discriminates against minorities...in this case Native Americans played by Fort Indians.

I am sure the same people who love this film will be the same types who loved ""Billy Jack"" (Part 1 and not the unwatchable sequels). The DVD cover claims ""the road has unexpected turns."" I didn't find anything new or unexpected.

Filmed in California, a state that has helmet laws. Now that was unexpected.

The junk all makes it to the big screen and the really good movies fade away without anyone even hearing about them. It was an accident that I bought this movie now I've watched it 3 times and will watch it again. The scenery was great and the message of the movie was a fact of life.

This is a powerful story that makes you think about family, friendship, and loyalty and what you would do to protect those you love.

There are so many films about Native Americans/Native Aboriginals that do not get wide distribution or exposure and I hope Jason will continue to bring Native American stories to the forefront, along with other Native American film makers.

6382447,5,B00JOWHSIW,"I didn't find this movie to be anywhere close to as violent as most movies are nowadays, the violence when it was there was appropriate for the story line. The movie description says ""two outlaw bikers"" when in fact they meet during the beginning of the movie and become friends as the movie progresses. One is running from the law, the other is running from his life.  I like to think that the latter becomes a better person having made the trip with Jason Momoa's character and seeing the family and community he is a part of. It is a also a sad commentary on how the federal government still treats American Indians poorly.  The ending is sad, and some things are left for you to fill in your own answers as to the fate of the rest.",1405900800,,735,4.318840579710145
6382448,5,B00JOWHSIW,"Let me start by saying that I know this movie will not be for everybody. Honestly, I can see half of my friends not getting it whatsoever. However, the other half will hopefully see it the way I did. Which is BRILLIANT. It was honest, raw, brutal, and beautiful. In the barest sense, fine. Here ya go. If you want fights, you will get your fights. If you want pretty guys and girls, it has that too.  But there is so so much more.
First, Jason and Robert wrote a story that is incredibly compelling, about a subject that too many people turn a blind eye to, or simply are not aware of. They do it in a way that I could not help but feel every emotion they portrayed, as strongly as they did. That is true story telling. They took landscapes that some would call bleak or boring, and made them absolutely stunning. I wanted to jump into the screen, be where they were, feel the freedom they seemed to. They opened our eyes to cultures that are fascinating, yet so few bother learning about. They created scenes that were incredibly intriguing, made scenes sexy and romantic that would not have been seen that way if not done with the minds and hearts of the ones who made this. And they took people and gave them the most powerful, loving relationships. Ones that ended up wanting to rip your heart out. I want these types of relationships. To have that kind of love, that kind of family, friendship, connection with others? That is a gift. I understand that this IS a movie. But isn't that the point? To make you forget that fact, and simply see what is on that screen as real. The actors in this movie did that, hands down. I already appreciated many of them. But I now have even more respect for those I knew, and love for those I just learned of through this film.

The only thing I can still hope for in the future is to see the Director's Cut of this film. This film is Jason's heart, and that of the friends and colleagues that made this with him. But as with any film, while it starts out your creation, others end up having their hands in it, make you change your vision in order to fit theirs. Sometimes that is good. Other times, things are lost. In this case, while the film lacks nothing for me, I have heard of some scenes, some pieces that did not make this final cut, that I very much hope to see someday. Things that can only add to an already amazing movie.",1405900800,5,2374,4.273333333333333
6382449,5,B00JOWHSIW,This is pretty good for a  wwe movie excellent picture and sound then again it should be for a new release movie Another biker movie for my collection,1405900800,,150,4.357142857142857
6382450,3,B00JOWHSIW,"I'm surprised how much I liked it.  Almost gave up in the middle (some parts are very slow!) but glad I watched till the end. Jason Momoa's character just breaks your heart in this - brooding, melancholy, lonely. I felt all the feelings.  He reminds me of Marlon Brando...can I say that???  They even have the same squinty eyes.  Marlon Brando is my favorite actor (except for Last Tango (ick!)), and Momoa definitely has the potential to be that great.

I'm giving it 3 stars because it's pretty slow and some of the dialogue was a little silly (""Good morning, sunshine!"").  Plus, I had to look away during some of the more violent scenes.  Some parts are really, really brutal.  But, I'm probably not the intended audience for this movie.

The scenery was gorgeous, though, and the soundtrack was fantastic!  Its def. worth renting.",1405900800,2,834,4.729166666666667
6382451,5,B00JOWHSIW,"Road to Paloma is an excellent movie. There were parts that reminded me of Easy Rider Billy Jack. It was a great road trip movie, but with a poignant social justice theme.

6382452,5,B00JOWHSIW,"I thought Road to Paloma was one of the most poignant and visually moving movies I've ever seen.  The visceral beauty of the film captured me from the opening scene, and it continued uninterrupted until the film's end, where I found myself yearning for more... The film's plot involves the FBI's manhunt for Robert Wolf, a young Native American man, who runs from the Law on his gutteral motorcycle.  As the fim unfolds, we follow Wolf's journey through the stark beauty of the Southwest. The viewer is mesmerized by the raw cinematography of the locale, the camaraderie of close friends, the loyal bonds of family; the achingly beautiful portrayal of physical love, and more. I do not wish to spoil this movie for the reader with my own words and opinions, because I certainly cannot do the film justice, no matter how many adjectives I may employ.  I simply wanted to share my highest recommendation for this moving film.  Huge kudos to Jason Momoa on his directorial debut.",1405814400,,976,4.791666666666667
6382453,4,B00JOWHSIW,"Congratulations to Jason Momoa for bringing to the public eye a very important issue that definitely deserves more awareness.  While the start is slow, the story finally pulls you in with its great actors and landscapes, especially at the end.  The audience might have become more emotionally invested in Wolf's personal cause if given just a little more information at the beginning.  Perhaps a few happy scenes of the family prior to the tragedy, including the mother whose death Wolf is avenging, and then a traditional Native American burial, followed by ""the Hunt"" scene.  That would have eliminated the need for deleting it.  It left me wanting more.

8652681,5,B00JOWHSIW,"This picture has been sorely under-rated at the very least. For an independent first shot at writing & directing from an actor who does nearly all action work, I just can't find all that many flaws. It is shot beautifully, the acting is superb, and the story sticks in your craw for a while after it has ended; ...say any of that about 99&3/4% of what'll be put out and will make fortunes this year. This is not a bloody revenge tale, as borne out by the choice to explain but never depict the killing that put Robert Wolf on the run, but rather a quiet, thoughtful, & deeply felt portrait of a natural outsider forlornly trying to navigate through a world he can never play a part in or even clearly understand. Jason Momoa plays a lot of these tribal/barbarian-type characters (Declan Harp, the Cimmerian, Khal Drogo, etc), who live in the distant past or in some completely fictional world where a good weapon and the inclination, heart, skill, & muscle to use it will serve them well. These characters are not savages, they just value love, loyalty, courage, justice, & above all freedom, while feeling no obligation to submit to someone else's misbegotten laws, in a place and time  where what a man can or can't do for himself and his own people is all that really matters. A line from Conan, ""Barbarians may be warriors, but they do not sacrifice their children or enslave their allies, like the priests & princes of the civilized world,"" comes to mind. In other words, none of them had ever been counted among the weak & fearful populace of 20th or 21st century earth. I'm quite sure it was never considered or intended during this film's development or production, but all the way through I kept feeling that Wolf was deep down of a kind with those other Momoa characters, say Harp or the Dothraki, & that he is living what they would all find for themselves if they were to be pulled out of their own lands & lives, & plunked down into 2014 America. They wouldn't be out-matched for a second, just outlawed, all alone & vastly outnumbered, and so, sadly lost.",1518048000,2,2069,4.546916890080429
