8478160,3,B005LJDR8W,"Hi! I am a fairly experienced amateur tap dancer. I would say I am an intermediate level dancer. this dvd was way too hard for me. They show each step once saying the names of the steps, but it goes by too fast. even in the practice and teaching, it goes fast. then he shows it again, saying the counts. He only lets you see it once from behind saying the steps: shuffle, ball change, etc. I would have to stop and rewind, or write it down. I,m no where near good enough for this dvd. I gave it to the library. I should have sent it back to amazon.

This is for someone who is really, really good, goes to lots of workshops, and can pick it up FAST!If you are an advanced dancer, you could definitely give this five stars.

Tap dance videos, for the most part, are not levelled. It's hard to judge because, if slowly and thoroughly taught, what looks like an advanced routine can actually be much easier than it looks at first. If I can get a slow breakdown of steps, I can dance some pretty complicated things, I just dance them at a slower tempo. You can't tell from watching trailers on you tube if the teaching is slow or thorough enough. I,m having trouble finding a dvd that's interesting and challenging for an intermediate dancer. They are either way too easy, which is boring, or too frustrating and hard.",1335571200,,1314,4.315789473684211
