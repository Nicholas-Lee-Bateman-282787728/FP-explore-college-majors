8484223,1,B005REHY8U,"This movie is a 4-star movie with Madeleine Carroll and Fred McMurray. If you have seen ""My Love For Yours"" also with the same two leading stars, you will recognize several of the same supporting actors. However, beware. This DVD is a copy from a videotaped piracy from a movie channel broadcast in the Los Angeles area years ago. The pirates were so sloppy at copying it, you can see the cuts for commercials and the identification of the movie channel itself. And the quality of the DVD is terrible. If you can get your head around this: cheap, overplayed,  never cleaned VHS player copying a video from broadcast television on a TV set with rabbit ears for an antennae, and then amateurs digitizing it and putting it on a DVD-R, then you'll understand what you will get if you buy this DVD.",1406764800,2,793,4.545454545454546
8484224,1,B005REHY8U,"In over 25 years of buying DVD's of vintage movies, this is one of the three WORST copies of a film I've ever received. It looks like a 5th generation copy of a video made from an early television broadcast. Granted the film itself in no masterpiece. In fact, it's a leaden melodrama set in the South starring a popular British actress. Clearly the producers were striving to create a minor-league, modern-era GONE WITH THE WIND, but they failed on every count. But my single star is for the quality of the DVD. If this is the best copy you have to offer, a seller should give prospective buyers a candid warning about it's quality. People who want to see the film for nostalgic reasons will buy it anyway. I bought it for an 80-year-old Madeline Carroll fan, but he gave up trying to watch it after about 30 minutes. Tsk!",1406592000,2,822,4.450331125827814
