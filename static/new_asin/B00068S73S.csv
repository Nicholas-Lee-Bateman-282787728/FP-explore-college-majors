The dangers are real and certainly not imagined.  I was an ASW Operator and flew with my Shipmates in the S-3a Viking Acft.  However, knowing that I was able to provide the ""Blanket of Freedom"", that some take for granted, and having served on Three (3) of the best Carriers in the fleet, the USS Independence CV-62, USS Dwight D Eisenhower, ""I Like Ike""CV-69, and last but not least the USS America CV-66, it makes me proud to realize the importance of SEA POWER, across the oceans.  I still to this very day Pray that the Sailors and the Marines who selflessly dedicate their lives, for our protection during these most turbulent times.  On the plus side I was able to go and see the very places that are the sources of all our troubles.  So bide well your tongue you scurvy knaves.  Or go and find out for yourself what it takes to be a bastion of Freedom for all to partake in.  But Non-Hackers need not apply.  ""Fair Winds and Following Seas"", Semper Fi, And, ""GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA""!  In closing, if those of you who want to burn the American Flag, Please wrap your Sorry Ass in it first!!!  Thank You.  ""HAZE GREY AND UNDERWAY...IT'S THE ONLY WAY""!",1490400000,,1305,4.414225941422594
8040322,4,B00068S73S,"Nevermind the misleading glossy modern cover. This is a documentary about USS John F Kennedy's deployment to Lebanon around the time of the Beirut barracks bombings in 1983.  The production quality is decent and reflective of the time. It is a nice, mostly unedited time capsule of Navy life in the early 80s.",1450137600,,309,4.830188679245283
8040323,2,B00068S73S,"This was a a wonderful and informative DVD. However, the quality was terrible it looks like a copy it was grainy and certainly was 2nd rate. It looks like it was copied off of television.",1260835200,2,187,4.371428571428571
8040324,1,B00068S73S,"Do not  buy this DVD. This is a very low quality product, both in image and editorial content, which is very limited and ends abruptly, leaving to many information and topics uncovered.",1191283200,5,185,4.78125
8040325,5,B00068S73S,"I live in Hawaii overlooking Pearl Harbor.  Needless to say, I see aircraft carriers on a regular basis.  Over the years I've had the opportunity to get ""personal"" tours on at least ten different carriers . . . by ""personal"" I mean one-on-one tours with a sailor assigned on the ship, a much more in-depth tour than tours open to the general public which usually include only the flight deck and hanger deck.  This DVD gives you much the same ""feel"" as a ""personal"" tour.  With this DVD, you can get a true look at the people manning these magificant ships as well as their families.  Although I've seen them many times, I still stand in awe of their size and power.",1181606400,4,666,4.426229508196721
