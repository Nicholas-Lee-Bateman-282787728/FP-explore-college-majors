8718120,2,B00YB7JIOM,"Rating not for these classic movies, but for this particular version (release). I should have had a clue when the studio was not mentioned in this listing, by the way it's NOSE-SILO. This NOISE-SILO release states both films have been digitally enhanced! Couldn't prove it by me as Alpha Video releases are better visually and sound wise, for half the money.
If like me your considering the set for the George Zucco ""Black Raven"" the way to go as of this writing is the Roan Group digitally remastered set that includes Black Dragons and The Black Raven. This set is truly enhanced and looks and sounds almost like a new release.
I truly enjoy the Black Raven and have sought out the best copy I could find, and hopefully I can save you both time and money as I own all of the mentioned releases of this movie. Get the Roan Group Archival Entertainment version it's the best one out there and is half as much money as the NOSE-SILO release. Sit back and enjoy another great George Zucco release.",1443916800,,995,4.533333333333333
