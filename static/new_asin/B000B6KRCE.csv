2403485,2,B000B6KRCE,"If you wanna see Mr. O having great amazing workouts, buy this, if you want to learn how you can improve, maybe better off saving your money. While the DVD is no doubt showing one of the best ever, Ronnie doesn't explain anything, there's no info on strategies, diet, pre-contest diet, bukling phases, etc. It's just Ronnie lifting ""light weight!"".",1142294400,3,348,4.816666666666666
2403486,5,B000B6KRCE,"The funniest thing I have ever seen in my life! I have a six pack as a result of watching this,it was THAT funny. The part with the tablets was quality. The training was ok too.

Before I saw this I wasn't a big fan of his but now, well, may he reign for ever! YEAH BUDDY!",1129334400,5,272,3.7719298245614037

8082462,4,B000B6KRCE,This video shows Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman during his off season. While I enjoyed this video it wasn't my favorite of his. The Unbelievable is still my favorite.,1370390400,,162,4.821428571428571
8082463,5,B000B6KRCE,The cost of redemption was a good quality video that really captured the awesomeness of big ron coleman.  If you want to see how a human being becomes a beast then buy this vid.,1364774400,,177,4.205882352941177
8082464,4,B000B6KRCE,"This is probably Ronnies second best movie (after unbelievable). This is a very long movie, it shows ronnies daily workouts, and 4(maybe5) of his meals for his training week. The viewer gets to see Ronnies squat heavy and bench heavy. His other workouts are not as impressive as the ones in Unbelievable. I personally enjoyed watching this, but if i had to choose, I would say unbelievable is better.

pros:
two powerful inspiring workouts
get a good look at life as mr olympia
this is before ronnie was endorsed by a major supplement company, so there is propaganda

cons:
mundane scenes (watching ronnie eat at outback, and black eyed pea about 20 times)
dosnt show all of ronnies meals ironically",1252800000,,699,4.816666666666666
8082465,4,B000B6KRCE,"The video is ok but definitely nowhere near as good as Unbelievable. Althought I liked his freakish workouts...for example that 2500 lb leg press. Dayum!!!!! I like the squat workout, that was pretty entertaining. This was his off season so his diet consisted of the same thing day after day. His sponsor should be Quaker Oats Instant Grits, ""lookit me!!! I ate Quaker Oats Instant Grits and It made me a multiple Mr. Olympia champion.......yeah buddy!!!"" All in all, it was entertaining when he was in the gym. I do watch his liftin' techniques and see what exercises I can incorporate into my workout.",1203811200,,603,4.8076923076923075
8082466,2,B000B6KRCE,"This video is boring as hell.  If you want an intense video by Ronnie's Cost of Redemption, or any of Jay Cutler's videos (preferably One Step Closer)  do NOT buy this one.  it's boring",1171411200,,185,4.382352941176471
8082467,1,B000B6KRCE,"If you want some information and motivation on body building this DVD is NOT for you. If you wanna see how boring Ronnie's life is then you might wanna see this. The entire movie consist of Ronnie eating his breakfast, hitting the gym, lifting weights(not the high intensity workouts but merely warmups), and same patterns over and over. There is hardly any dialogs (other than Ronnie saying ""ohh"", ""ahh"" and ""yeah buddy"" between workouts) and the only music, if there is any, is the music that is playing in the gym or the TV playing in Ronnie's kitchen. His Kitchen looks rather an ordinary kitchen; not what I expect from Mr. Olympia who probably makes more  than an averrage Joe. Take my advice and buy  ""Pumping Iron"" 25th aniversary DVD instead. That is ten times more entertaining.",1149552000,3,788,4.744525547445256
8082468,5,B000B6KRCE,"For those of you who might need a little motivation to hit the gym Mr. O brings it hardcore for three straight hours. This DVD takes you through a typical week of training and diet for Big Ron and you see what a real bodybuilding lifestyle is like up close and personal. It isn't scientific, just brute force, pure intensity and dedication. I've had the pleasure of meeting Ronnie on two occasions and he's been pleasant if not verbose when posing for pictures and signing autograps. When I asked how many calories he eats daily he replied ""I don't know that's too much work, I just eat!"" I truly believe him too, which is amazing in the climate of modern bodybuilding. There's definately no acting just Big Nasty in the flesh letting his muscles do all the talking.",1147910400,,766,4.557971014492754
