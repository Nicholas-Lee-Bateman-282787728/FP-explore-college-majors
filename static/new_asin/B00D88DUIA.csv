I highly recommend ""Japanese Life Goods store."" The store owner ""Koji"" personally emailed me to inform me my order is on the way & to notify him as soon as I received my DVD.",1431216000,,326,3.9545454545454546

8590537,4,B00D88DUIA,"I own all of SCANDAL's live discs - yeah, you can call me a fan. One thing their discs all have in common is great performances - SCANDAL are just an amazing live band. I saw them myself at Budokan, so I know that this isn't just a result of post-production tricks. They have great energy, great stage presence, they know how to connect with the crowd and they both play and sing well.  And they did all that from the time of their first live DVD.

What's changed over the years is how polished the production itself is. The early rawness of being in a small club with no real light show, shooting somewhat grainy footage on low-end SD cameras and releasing that footage without much post-processing has now been replaced with huge stage and light shows, flashy costumes, and the use - and now over-use - of post-production effects on both the video and audio.

Specifically, there's an overuse of Auto-tune on this disc, and it does get distracting once you hear it. Some may like the fact that Auto-tune makes the performance sound ""perfect"" but it also often gives the vocals that same robotic sound that's associated with Auto-tune, and that's pervasive throughout the disc.  The whole point of buying a concert video is to hear the band singing live, and that's not what you're hearing on this disc.

So that's the bad news.  For some, that may be enough to make the disc not worth buying.

But the overall performance does still come through. And because of the special setting of this show (which reflects back to their very early days), they play a lot of songs that you rarely hear these days. I think I still like the Budokan set list better, but it's nice to hear ""Shining Sun"" again, or ""Hoshi no Furu Yoru ni"". Some songs they have played many times before in the past year but this disc clearly has the best live version (despite the Auto-tune), like ""Rock 'n' Roll"" and ""Taiyou Scandalous"".

If you're a real fan of the band, it's also nice to see them get so emotional about this concert. This was a dream come true for them and it shows. Their emotions come out at various times throughout the show, and then it takes them a really long time to leave the stage after the last song, during which two of them completely break down and even the normally cool and collected Mami wipes a tear away. It's just nice to see a band that really cares that much about their fans and about playing music.

So no criticism of the band at all here - they did a great job and are fun to watch, as always. If it weren't for the overuse of Auto-tune, this would be a 5 star disc.",1374969600,,2579,4.401260504201681
