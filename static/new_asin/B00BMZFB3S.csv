I watched it with him and they did a great job with the remastering and is overall very fun to watch. Since seeing this one he had purchased the next two in the series.,1455321600,2,324,4.0

8571276,1,B00BMZFB3S,"Great original films if you could get to them and listen to the narration without that racket (some moron playing a guitar or something like that and making a noise that nobody had been subjected to at the time this film was produced).  Whatever it is, this noise is extremely obnoxious.  The films would be great if you could shut off that racket (or if some twenty first century idiot hadn't put it on there in the first place).",1398297600,7,430,4.430379746835443

8571278,5,B00BMZFB3S,"This is a great dvd of the International Harvester equipment advertising films from the 1920s.  This DVD shows advertising films produces by International Harvester showing off the ""new"" Farmall.  I really enjoyed seeing the old equipment in action. Many models I had never seen.  You even see the inside of the dealers service bay back in the 1920s.
There has been music and sound effects added to the original films but they are like a time portal to great grandpas farming days!",1387238400,4,481,4.841463414634147
