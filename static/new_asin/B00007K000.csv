1816647,3,B00007K000,"First off, this film is definitely a mature audience only; for both all the nudity and the plotline that can get confusing towards the end.
The series starts out slow to begin with. There was one point towards the beginning I was just waiting for it to be over. The closer I got to the end, the more interested I was. The plot also takes a lot of turns towards the end.
As for the ""fan service"" (i.e., adult stuff), there's a lot of it because in order for the two main characters to use their power to the best ability, they can't be wearing any clothing. There's also another thing that happens that I don't think I can mention in this review. A lot of people purchase this series for all of that, I got it because I saw parts of it and all the fight scenes that take place in it.
As for the extras; for languages there are only English dub or Japanese with subtitles; you can't just watch it in Japanese. This isn't a problem for me, but maybe that would annoy some of you. There's another nice feature that is a slide show of several character sketches. I don't have a DVD-Rom drive so I can't test out those features.
Are there better films out there? Yes. Are there worse films? Definitely.",1026432000,3,1196,4.273127753303965
1816648,1,B00007K000,"On the plus side, there is a ton of fan service.  On the down side, it's overall quite annoying.  After the fourth episode it felt like I was watching it just to finish the series, rather than wanting to know what was going to happen.  While it is pretty straightforward and predictable it still manages to be semi-incoherent.
I do have to say that fans of The Slayers would probably rate this as 3 stars.  Everyone else probably would find it a chore to finish.  There are better anime discs to watch if you are looking for a disc with some fan service.",999907200,3,554,4.339805825242719
1816649,4,B00007K000,"This is kind of a weird anime because its the OVA sequal to a TV series. The anime is really titled VS Knights Lamunes & 40 Fresh. The original TV show was VS Knights Lamunes & 40 Fire. The story starts out on an alternative future version of Earth after the events of the TV series where two holy virgins, Cacao and Parfait, who originally helped save the world with the help of the third in a great line of warriors called Ramunes that was really a kid who got sent into the future via a video game(kinda like on Monster Rancher). They are sent further into the future to find the 4th Ramunes warrior along with their small blob robot commrade Piqu. The girls find someone claiming to be the 4th Warrior, but he's actually the commander of an invading force. They escape his space fortress in a giant mecha, along with the orphen girl Lemon. What follows is the realization of who the 4th Warrior really is and the recovery of a large robot named the Mythical Knight that was created to destroy the galaxy. Knights Of Ramune is a very funny series and brings a good aftermath to the original TV series which should hopefully get picked up in America soon. Oddly enough, VS Knights Lamunes & 40 Fire was really the remake of another anime called NG Knights Lamunes which had 2 sequals of its own. It's a little odd having an anime like KOR(Knights Of Ramune)which is really the tail-end of the whole saga to be released before any of the other Lamune titles. This was also supposed to be the lead in to another new series called Knights Of Lemon which never got off the ground though. There's lots of great action though and tons of juicy fan service. This series lives up more to the title ""Slayers in space"" than a certain other sci-fi show did.",999216000,2,1748,4.414860681114551
7977163,2,B00007K000,"I really wanted to like this anime but it's just so bad :(

The absurd amount of fan service is so distracting from the plot that I'm not really sure what all is happening in this show.  Even if the fan service was removed the series still drags in it's pacing of the plot.  I found it very hard to get into the plot at all.  I could only finish 4/6 episodes.  It's my understanding that these episode take place in the middle (or end) of the Knight of Ramune story.  Unfortunately this is all that was released in the United States.  If the complete series was available it might redeem these episodes.  I can't say for sure.

Overall I high recommend that everyone avoids this anime.  Life is short.  We don't have time to watch everything.  Make sure you use your time wisely and watch something worth the time.",1451260800,,814,4.3533333333333335

7977167,4,B00007K000,"You have already read all the ( justly deserved ) warnings here about Knights of Ramune, but I would like to add several observations about its very clever writing.  This story, full as it is with fan service, physical abuse of women, implied-or-more lesbianism, violence and mayhem actually is about NONE of these.  Although admittedly having many of the elements present in hentai or ecchi anime, it also has very interesting characterizations, particularly among the nominal ""villians"" of the piece.  There are also enough plot twists to keep you wondering just how it all will turn out, and to let you know things are not exactly what they may seem.

It's true the beginning can seem quite confusing, based as it is on previous Japanese series, but several viewings ( which this merits ) will straighten most of this out.  Our two ( and eventually three ) heroines,  the superbly-endowed Cacao, red-headed Parfait - whose temper matches her coloring, and their acolyte Lemon all have fairly cute designs reminiscent, as pointed out elsewhere here, of characters in Slayers.  Their inter-relations are quite amusing, from Lemon's admiration and envy of ""Big Sister Parfait"" to the unusual method Cacao uses to ""relax"" after performing her stint as Holy Virgin.  Also, are the exchanges between Parfait and their smug and highly annoying mini-robot PiQu, who is the butt of much well-deserved abuse.

However, it is the treatment of their opponents which really makes Knights shine.  True, Rumford/Ramune's design is very stereotypical of the period in which this was created, with lots of spiky hair, very high-collared cape, and huge shoulder guards; but it his warped personality ( and the reasons behind it ) that make him a surprisingly sympathetic, if not exactly likeable villian.  His female underlings each have their motovations and concerns too, again not all what they at first appear; as does his erstwhile misguided mentor, Don Vodka.  But it is his much put-upon and long-suffering android guardian/servant Electone who elicits the most sympathy, as she wants only to be useful and appreciated by Rumford, who she has helped to distort into the egomaniacal monster Ramunes has become.

As an OAV, this has beautiful animation and art, superior as usual to contemporary TV productions; and the Japanese cast is likewise excellent.  I highly recommend a very close watching of EACH of the six opening segments, as they all have their little differences, foreshadowing the twists the particular segment is to take.  And the spurious ""preview"" at the end is hiliarious as well.  I would rate this DVD even higher, but for the very valid reservations expressed in some of the other reviews here, which obviously alienate segments of the anime-watching audience.",1225756800,,2773,5.128888888888889
7977168,5,B00007K000,"Lots of great fan service in this anime, so if you like lots of pretty girls jiggling around you MUST buy this.

In addition KoR has a good story line and a great price. 3 hours of amazing anime for $10 is an unbeatable deal. I very strongly reccomend this anime.",1181433600,,263,4.1568627450980395
7977169,1,B00007K000,"I could not stand this anime at all. Though I admit I liked the songs, I have to say this show has WAY TOO MUCH fan service. The story wasn't good either. The only character I cared about was Drum which sadly, you don't get to know much about her. Like I said, I could not stand this one",1147824000,2,287,3.8813559322033897
7977170,5,B00007K000,"Knights of Ramune is a very quizzical title. It's about two girls who set off to find the knight, Sir Ramune, and save the world, or something, I don't know, there wasn't really wasn't much to it. One of them is a trained space explorer/knight, the other is a ""holy virgin"", I didn't get that part either. The movie starts off with those two going into space, and getting ready to take the mission. Through their follies and mishaps, they somehow end up in the right direction to finding Sir Ramune. They meet up with some help, in form of a mecha which they steal, and later on with a little haired girl.

7977171,1,B00007K000,"What can I say about this anime? Most people will be pulled in by the suspiciously familiar lead character. No it's not Lina Inverse and this is nothing like Slayers. It's crude and unintresting. If you like Slayers, try Rune Soldiers. This is a really poor show.",1068249600,5,263,4.617021276595745
