2716608,1,B000LXH0D6,"This started by being all red with two men and women. The women sucking and
riding their lollipops, but the quality of the video is poor but watchable,
out of focus and silent. I won't go there again.

Vanessa was enjoying her lolly in many ways while the other woman was on the
floor. I will say that they were very active, getting exercise in many ways.
The trouble is the close-ups, they were so close that I could see the spinach
in her teeth.

These are more shorts, and the second was brown and white. Vanessa was
enjoying more of the exercise but with a bigger and black lollipop. I had
to sit way back to see this one because of the colour, and being close-up
most of the time was hard to watch. In some parts Vanessa is so white I
thought I was seeing a ghost. vanessa also loves her cream.

The viewing is much better than ""Retro Hooterama"" and ""Retro Stag Party All
Color Spectacular 2"", but don't think it is 100%, way from it.

The next one she is on a blanket covered sofa with a guy, taking it slow and
easy, but the trouble is you can only cram so much onto a dvd. What is it
with all these close-ups? I am starting to get eye strain and my eyeballs
are turning red.

It is more of the same use of the lollipop, same boring stuff, no variety.
You get more variety out of a box of corn flakes, and at least you can
enjoy yourself with them, and you can see them floating in the milk.

The black guy is back again but this short got stuffed up so it was stopped.
Pity they didn't do that to all of them. So starts the next one. A man comes
to the door, they talk and go and sit on the sofa. He produces a pistol and
demands to be used in the normal fashion. She gets to work on him while he
holds a gun on her. I know what I would do if I had the gun. She ends up
doing the same to the pistol.

This time the lady gets another visitor, but the film is so washed out you
can't tell what is going on. I don't know if I should fast-forward it or
have a cat-nap.

A chess set is the next start, but I do not know what it has to do with
anything. The couple are next to the bed, he lifts her up onto his
shoulders he starts to enjoy his burger. She leans back and eventually
falls onto the bed. He must be strong for a skinny guy as she is lying
between his legs and he grabs her, pulls her up until she is upside down
so she can enjoy the lollipop. A bit of variety goes a long way.

I can't stress enough how bad the quality of the video is, and recommend
it should be sent to the big dvd grave in the sky.

I was glad to see the end of it so I could refocus my eyes on the normal
world again. I'm drained of energy, as you need it all to try and tell
what is going on most of the time.

In all honesty I can not rate this dvd, to do so would mean I am lying.",1300147200,3,2770,3.8336252189141855
2716609,1,B000LXH0D6,"This DVD collection is probably the worst of them all, picture quality is way too poor for DVD format, it was very grainy and dark in viewing. I wouldn't have to comment on the content.",1182124800,21,185,4.314285714285714
2716610,1,B000LXH0D6,"A collection of foreign, not even B rated movies that are disappointing at best.",1179705600,17,80,4.785714285714286
2716611,1,B000LXH0D6,"This is the fourth time I've typed out a review for this 'collection'.  Maybe this time it will take.

First off there are half a dozen movies in this collection.  None of them are over three stars.  Three of them are soft porn and one of the worst jobs I've ever imagined.  Example:  One move has two toy dolls having sex with each other and nothing but that.  Example:  The first hour of one movie is five females adlibing for over an hour--and they're not any good at it.
Here are the names:

FROM VENUS;  2 stars.  Clean movie.
SANDY HOOK'S LINGERIE PARTY MASSACRE: 0 stars. Soft porn with the five females.
NIGHTMARE MUSEUM:  0 star.  The dolls.
RAPE IS A CIRCLE;  0 star.  Soft porn.  Would have been drama if not for the first hour of porn.
SO MORT IT BE:  3 stars.  Horror, the two guys can act, some originalitly.
SORORITY BABES IN THE DANCE-A-THON OF DEATH: 2 stars-fairly clean.

So that's it, I don't recommend the collection but if you can find those 'okay' movies individually they are an okay way to kill a boring night.  BYE!",1178582400,56,1041,4.378947368421053
