I noticed results within a few weeks and as long as you continue the workout, you can easily maintain them. The workout is made of easy movements but is very intense even though it's short and you can feel the burn the whole time you are working out. I love that it only takes 8 minutes to get such amazing results and it's easy to fit into my daily routine. The instructor of the series, Jamie, helps keep you motivated and focused on proper form so as not to aggravate your back and his continuous talking helps the time fly by. Most importantly, the workout works for noticeably toned legs! HIghly recommended!

Only giving this 4 stars because I had purchased the 8 Minute Buns workout that came with 8 Minute Thighs and it is the EXACT same workout as 8 Minute Legs! Be aware so you don't waste money!",1407628800,,886,4.273809523809524
