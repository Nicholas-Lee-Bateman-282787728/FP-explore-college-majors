8509859,2,B0074FVU80,"3D Horrible, how can they legally get away with calling crap like this 3D? Story has strong old fashion vibe of 'good vs evil', imagery very creative - artistic - beautiful. Nice to have a new angle on the 'Nutcracker' theme. This would be an adventurous young Family Christmas film. I bought it for the 3D, it is of No value watching this in 3D they ruined it. If you want a dramatic youthful Family Christmas film this could be fun PG-13 for scary theme.",1520294400,,456,4.376470588235295
