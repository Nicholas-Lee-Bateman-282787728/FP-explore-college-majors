8507845,5,B0070WGZ4G,"Amber Kuo is one of my favorite actress and I have seen and enjoyed a number of her movies such as ""Channel X"", ""Invincible Shan Boa Mei"" and ""Love Forward"" which was very excellent. This talented actress has such a sweet voice like a little girl's voice in a woman's body. I have been waiting for more releases that have her in it.",1408147200,,332,4.285714285714286
