5009441,3,B006OKOXKS,"The ""Fan Favorite"" collection sounds like another of Ralph's hare-brained schemes. If you want just a handful of the classic Honeymooner episodes, then perhaps this is the way to go. But for a ""mere bag of shells"" you could buy the complete ""Classic 39"" episode set here on Amazon (currently an extra $15.00) which not only includes all of these ""fan favorite"" episodes, but the rest of the fabled 1955 season as well?

Of course I have my own favorites, most of which are included here, but several others are not. My mom got me hooked on the Honeymooners when I was a teenager back in 1985 when they were on every evening on local TV. She bought me the ""Classic 39"" collection as a Christmas gift a few years back and I love it.

If you can't get enough Honeymooners, I would take a pass on this fan favorite set and get the complete set.",1330992000,2,840,4.378205128205129

5009466,4,B006OKOXKS,"WOW, I'VE ONLY WATCHED ONE SHOW SO FAR ABOUT THE TV AND CAPTAIN VIDEO AND HIS VIDEO RANGERS. I LAUGHED AT IT STILL WITH GUSTO. ART CARNEY AND JACKIE GLEASON TO ME WERE AS ZANY, COMICAL AND TALENTED AS THE TEAM OF STAN LAUREL AND OLIVER HARDY: WHO WERE THE GREATEST. THEY ALL OUT SHINE THE 3 STOOGES AND ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE TV TEAM OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. I AM ENJOYING ALL THE MOVIES I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PAST MONTH: THANKS.",1397779200,3,426,4.144578313253012
