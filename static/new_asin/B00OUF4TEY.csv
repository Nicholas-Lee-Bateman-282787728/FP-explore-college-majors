8685033,5,B00OUF4TEY,"This (along with the whole series) was a wonderful class.
I have been building puppets for several years and these have given me so many new techniques to use.  BJ Guyer is a great builder and has a lot of knowledge to share.  Because of that he does some talking to explain his methods and alternatives.
There is some confusion from time to time as to which camera to use for the best angle but that is part of the charm and shows the effort put into getting us the best view.  The actual film and sound quality are great.  I watched them once and am now working my way through them while taking notes and doing several builds.
If you want a series that doesn't make you feel like an idiot because info is skipped or left out, GET THESE.  Or if you like to feel like part of the class, GET THESE.  If you enjoy puppet building, GET THESE.
I haven't used any of the other Stan Winston series so I don't know how they compare.  I can tell you that I have seen several of them that I plan to purchase soon.
Thanks for the series.  Looking forward to getting more.  -Jeromy",1420243200,,1070,4.180487804878049

This dvd has a lot of talking, it could be much better edited and filmed.
I have seen much better tutorials on you tube....",1415577600,,149,4.357142857142857
