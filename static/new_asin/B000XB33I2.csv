8227690,5,B000XB33I2,"We have all the I Love Toy Train DVD and this Christmas edition does not disappoint!  My son love to watch this one.  After 3 years I am still puzzled as to how my son can watch several hours straight of Trains, but he does.  This is a fun edition to our I Love Toy Trains collection.",1358380800,,284,3.9473684210526314
8227691,5,B000XB33I2,"This is a well produced short DVD that keeps the grandsons (and probably granddaughters) entertained.  Its not so long as to lose their focus, not too short as to cheat the viewer.  Cute, fun, and entertaining.  I would highly recommend it for any young person that loves transportation and / or toy train sets; especially Lionel.",1356739200,,330,4.857142857142857
8227692,5,B000XB33I2,My 4 year old absolutely LOVES this movie.  We watch it over and over-a must for any kid who loves trains. My son loves to dance to the music and it's educational! We ordered the CD's by James Coffey as well. Product arrived as promised.,1333584000,,237,4.266666666666667
8227693,4,B000XB33I2,"This is a great dvd for anyone who loves trains.  I love the fact that there are stories and poetry read as well as songs sung on this dvd so your eyes and ears can take in Christmas!  My son requests this dvd every day since we've bought it so I know it's a hit.  I would have rated it 5 stars if there had been at least part of the movie where the perspective was the very nose of the train moving through the scenes and thus having a better sense of the layouts.  That being said, this is a great way to get into the Christmas spirit and I highly recommend this dvd.",1317081600,2,569,3.9217391304347826
