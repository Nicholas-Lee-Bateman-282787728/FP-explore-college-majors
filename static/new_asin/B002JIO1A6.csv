8572298,4,B002JIO1A6,"Despite being low budget, this doc looks at one of the WBC's controversial protests with a clear genuine interest in making a good documentary without succumbing to the temptation to ask leading questions to incite a wacky response. It's a great look with some real journalistic objectivity at a group that many of us, myself included, naturally recognize as bigoted jerks. This film simply presents another look inside the Westboro Baptist Church with the bulk of the weight carried by raw footage and conversations. While I love a good documentary about how crazy and awful the WBC is, sometimes it's nice to see the information presented in this basic, raw format where the facts speak for themselves (and, for the record, the facts show the WBC is still a bunch of bigots).

A good watch for anyone academically interested in politics, religion, and/or the social effects of the WBC as a group.",1442793600,,898,4.907894736842105
