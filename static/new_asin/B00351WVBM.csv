8388582,4,B00351WVBM,"This is an interesting DVD with lots of nice footage and action however there are only two segments that deal with the Soviet/Russian Navy.
The first one is called Russian Navy and that deals with all aspects of the Soviet Navy and includes lots of nice footage on Soviet ships, submarines, fishing boats, cruisers and many more. Very nicely done. The other film that deals with the Soviet Navy is ""Challenge Below"" in which the US Navy theoretically thinks how the Soviets would deploy their submarines to attack the US and how the Navy would respond to such attacks.
The other films are interesting but they are not related to the Soviet Navy.
The following are the contents of the DVD:

Film 1-The Russian Navy 24:21 minutes
Film 2-The Challenge Below 16:31 minutes
Film 3-Russian Newsreels 19:12 minutes
Film 4-Beneath the Navy Wings 28:25
Film 5-Russian Submarine 6:11

Russian newsreels is a compilation of news footage from the Soviets during war. Beneath the Navy Wings is a little movie produced by the US Navy showing the different career options available in the Navy and the last film shows the inside of the Russian submarine at the San Diego maritime museum.

Overall a nice historic DVD worth having in your collection if you like military history.",1388102400,,1263,4.865116279069768
