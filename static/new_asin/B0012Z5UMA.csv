3101157,5,B0012Z5UMA,I was first hesitating to purchase from Amazon due to it being my first time and I was surprisingly satisfied for the great condition I find the product I received.,1288915200,,164,4.5
3101158,5,B0012Z5UMA,"Sean Cameron, Emma Nelson's first love, returns, shaking the foundation of her seemingly solid relationship with Peter Stone, who stuck with her during her eating disorder battle in season 5.  Sean and Peter continuously butt heads with each other over Emma, which leads them to an illegal street race that ends badly.  Sean and Emma do end up getting back together, but Sean's image of Emma being perfect is shattered when he finds out a secret about her and Jay (think back to season 4).  A new girl name Mia Jones, a former Lakehurst student, becomes a student at Degrassi, and is at first snubbed by Darcy (the new Squad captain) when she tries to get on the cheerleading squad simply because she has a kid, which is how she ends up hooking up with J.T. Yorke.  Liberty, J.T.'s ex-girlfriend, is jealous and bitter about J.T. moving on, especially since she still has feelings for him, and is still dealing with things from the previous year. J.T. has a rivalry with some Lakehurst thugs. Darcy finds herself being stalked by an online predator. Paige, starting her first year at University, finally starts to crack under the pressure and has panic attacks. Craig returns, and brings his drug problem along with him, which leads to the end of his relationship with Manny.  Ellie Nash, who is in college and dating the editor of the newspaper, falls for Craig once again, and his hurt by Craig once again, due to his addiction.  Manny, determined to make herself feel better after her break-up with Craig, decides to throw a birthday party for Liberty at Emma's place when her parents go out of town.  The party is soon out of control, and once some uninvited guests arrive, the party takes a tragic turn and we see the loss of one of Degrassi's beloved characters.

Definitely another good, intense season, which will definitely (in my opinion) require some tissues after the death of one of the main characters",1278374400,,1915,4.72972972972973

3101188,5,B0012Z5UMA,I love Degrassi I will never get tired of bad acting with alot of drama. This show never has a dull moment.,1387152000,,107,3.909090909090909

3101192,3,B0012Z5UMA,I liked the original Degrassi Junior High and decided to give this a chance.  Although some of the stories are ok to good - they get tediously repetitive.  And not just the same story line but the same characters with the same story line.....  I'm tired of it,1376956800,,259,4.354166666666667
3101193,5,B0012Z5UMA,"I am 50 years old and still enjoy this show.  I hope to see more episodes soon. Amazon is somewhat better than Netflix, however on some series and movies you can buy the DVD""s much cheaper than watching them once. Prime needs to add more overall.",1375660800,,246,4.3478260869565215
3101194,5,B0012Z5UMA,So this season is the best in my opinion Sean comes back semma begins again. Sean finds out what happened with jay and Emma. Peter gets his. Manny has a lot of troubles and gets back with Craig so begins cranny again. By far the best season with the old crew and some of the best stories also.,1374451200,,293,4.068965517241379
3101195,5,B0012Z5UMA,Degrassi is my favorite show and I was so happy to find this season for such a good price. The disc looks great! I haven't watched it yet but I am sure I am going to love it!!! Thank you Movie Mars for another great sale!!,1373241600,,222,3.847826086956522

3101201,5,B0012Z5UMA,"degrassi is a great show, i grew up watching it.so needless to say i wanted more seasons as i have season 1 through 5 and now finally six",1356220800,,137,3.9285714285714284
3101202,5,B0012Z5UMA,Every season of Degrassi keeps getting better. Love it. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys shows of this nature. Happy and satisfiedwith the purchase.,1344211200,,159,5.153846153846154
3101203,2,B0012Z5UMA,The Degrassi box was all damaged. -_- All the disk were fine. But the box looked like it was knocked around heaps.,1325203200,,114,4.2272727272727275
3101204,5,B0012Z5UMA,"The season itself is packed with amazing story lines with J.T. and Lakehurst, Craig Returing and Sean and Emma drama. This is one of my favorite seasons of Degrassi.
The extras could be greatly improved though, I always enjoy a cast commentary, it's been done in previous DVD's and I was confused as to why this one didn't include a commentary especially on an episode like ""What's it Feel like to be a Ghost?""
The picture quality is greatly improved from previous seasons however, it's still not the best on a superb DVD or BluRay player and TV but it's a lot better than it used to be",1292630400,,586,4.435185185185185
3101205,3,B0012Z5UMA,"Season 6 kicks off with the return of Sean Cameron.  The last viewers saw this character was back in mid-season 4 in Back in Black.  In the season opener, he and his ex Emma Nelson begin to rekindle their high school romance; but there is a problem, Peter Stone is determined to keep these two apart in the first 3 episodes.

Degrassi also gets new rivals and newbies in Mia (played by Nina Dorbev) and Johnny.  Both characters later become heavily linked later in the season when Degrassi looses one of its beloved characters.

Meanwhile, Jimmy and Spinner restore their friendship after a couple of seasons due to the school shooting that paralyzed Jimmy.  Spinner and Darcy are back together, but not for long.  Jimmy and Ashley are together, while Jimmy is aimed to satisfy Ashley more than just on a emotional level.  Alex also returns back to Degrassi for a fast-track to improve her grades to get into college. Later in the season, Alex has to set her pride to the side to make quick cash when things go terribly wrong at home.

The graduates, who actually went to college, start embarking on their new journey post-Degrassi but not without its share of problems.  Ellie is a freshman reporter of her college paper which leads to her developing a relationship with head-editor Jesse.  Ellie though can't seem to get over Craig, who also is dealing more than with his fair share of bad habits.  Marco becomes warily that his boyfriend Dylan could be cheating and Marco becomes addicted to a new activity which could have him losing more than just fair share of winnings.  Paige returns midway in the season facing the possibilities she has failed at her dream college.  Paige and Alex take on their relationship for the second time, where there seems to be more angst and heartache from the last break-up.  Can these two make it through the storm or will the pain be much too serve to restore?

All in all I found this season to be decent.  Season 6 didn't leave up to any huge expectations like previous seasons.  The show didn't pick up for me until Rock this Town and the graduates got most of the story towards the end of the season.  Yet this is only my opinion, if you are a Degrassi buff, I would recommend you purchasing this season to add to your collection.",1289174400,2,2273,4.5816831683168315

3335688,5,B0012Z5UMA,I used to watch this show when it first aired. I am so glad they finally put more seasons on prime. I am catching up and its great!!,1379548800,,132,3.75
3335689,3,B0012Z5UMA,I liked the original Degrassi Junior High and decided to give this a chance.  Although some of the stories are ok to good - they get tediously repetitive.  And not just the same story line but the same characters with the same story line.....  I'm tired of it,1376956800,,259,4.354166666666667
3335690,5,B0012Z5UMA,"I am 50 years old and still enjoy this show.  I hope to see more episodes soon. Amazon is somewhat better than Netflix, however on some series and movies you can buy the DVD""s much cheaper than watching them once. Prime needs to add more overall.",1375660800,,246,4.3478260869565215
3335691,5,B0012Z5UMA,So this season is the best in my opinion Sean comes back semma begins again. Sean finds out what happened with jay and Emma. Peter gets his. Manny has a lot of troubles and gets back with Craig so begins cranny again. By far the best season with the old crew and some of the best stories also.,1374451200,,293,4.068965517241379
3335692,5,B0012Z5UMA,Degrassi is my favorite show and I was so happy to find this season for such a good price. The disc looks great! I haven't watched it yet but I am sure I am going to love it!!! Thank you Movie Mars for another great sale!!,1373241600,,222,3.847826086956522

3335700,2,B0012Z5UMA,The Degrassi box was all damaged. -_- All the disk were fine. But the box looked like it was knocked around heaps.,1325203200,,114,4.2272727272727275
3335701,5,B0012Z5UMA,"The season itself is packed with amazing story lines with J.T. and Lakehurst, Craig Returing and Sean and Emma drama. This is one of my favorite seasons of Degrassi.
The extras could be greatly improved though, I always enjoy a cast commentary, it's been done in previous DVD's and I was confused as to why this one didn't include a commentary especially on an episode like ""What's it Feel like to be a Ghost?""
The picture quality is greatly improved from previous seasons however, it's still not the best on a superb DVD or BluRay player and TV but it's a lot better than it used to be",1292630400,,586,4.435185185185185
3335702,3,B0012Z5UMA,"Season 6 kicks off with the return of Sean Cameron.  The last viewers saw this character was back in mid-season 4 in Back in Black.  In the season opener, he and his ex Emma Nelson begin to rekindle their high school romance; but there is a problem, Peter Stone is determined to keep these two apart in the first 3 episodes.

Degrassi also gets new rivals and newbies in Mia (played by Nina Dorbev) and Johnny.  Both characters later become heavily linked later in the season when Degrassi looses one of its beloved characters.

Meanwhile, Jimmy and Spinner restore their friendship after a couple of seasons due to the school shooting that paralyzed Jimmy.  Spinner and Darcy are back together, but not for long.  Jimmy and Ashley are together, while Jimmy is aimed to satisfy Ashley more than just on a emotional level.  Alex also returns back to Degrassi for a fast-track to improve her grades to get into college. Later in the season, Alex has to set her pride to the side to make quick cash when things go terribly wrong at home.

The graduates, who actually went to college, start embarking on their new journey post-Degrassi but not without its share of problems.  Ellie is a freshman reporter of her college paper which leads to her developing a relationship with head-editor Jesse.  Ellie though can't seem to get over Craig, who also is dealing more than with his fair share of bad habits.  Marco becomes warily that his boyfriend Dylan could be cheating and Marco becomes addicted to a new activity which could have him losing more than just fair share of winnings.  Paige returns midway in the season facing the possibilities she has failed at her dream college.  Paige and Alex take on their relationship for the second time, where there seems to be more angst and heartache from the last break-up.  Can these two make it through the storm or will the pain be much too serve to restore?

All in all I found this season to be decent.  Season 6 didn't leave up to any huge expectations like previous seasons.  The show didn't pick up for me until Rock this Town and the graduates got most of the story towards the end of the season.  Yet this is only my opinion, if you are a Degrassi buff, I would recommend you purchasing this season to add to your collection.",1289174400,2,2273,4.5816831683168315
