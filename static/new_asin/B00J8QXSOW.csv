The video course is not perfectly produced. Front view and side view of a single movement may not be and mostly to by the same demonstrator and same clip( shoot from both angle at once).

HOWEVER, this is the best available on the market. Among all books or video, free or charged, modern or vintage, this is the best course currently available.  Most other videos are not course, most are not even qualify as traditional martial art.

The gem of this book is to follow its directly and practice about 2 ours daily with a single routine each month through a year. A lot benefit is not to,d to the audience and its hard to express. It just works despite how elementary the movement looks like. Yes, it's ridiculous simple and a while belt can advance to more complex form in a month.
The benefit does not surface easily. Only after you work on it religiously over one to three months depends on your own condition and knowledge, the benefit won't be realized.

However, how much you can get out of this is depends on our own knowledge. You need to invest a lot more on the subject area to get benefit. Like research paper.

You have to follow the movement exactly and smoothly. And slow and smooth like taichi instead of quick and power like boxing.

This is not designed to be a fighting technic.  The block and punch are ideal. The heart if the routine is to build a foundation.

This is a must but only a handful will really carry it out. You just don't buy and watch. You have to do it. And do it...till one day you realize the fruit is sweet.",1414195200,2,1766,4.359756097560975
