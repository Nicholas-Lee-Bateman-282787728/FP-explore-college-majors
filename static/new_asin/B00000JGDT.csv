1232202,5,B00000JGDT,"In the third season of Upstairs Downstairs we say goodbye to Lady Marjorie, Elizabeth, Sarah, and Thomas, who all depart the show, but welcome Hazel Forrest, a shy middle class girl whom James has fallen in love with after enduring great sorrow.  Hazel is my favorite character in all of Updown.  The aristocrats sneer at her, but she's worth fifty of any of them!  Another newcomer is Georgina Worsley, ward of Richard Bellamy and soon to be the object of James' wandering eye.  Below stairs we meet Daisy, the new parlor maid and soon to be wife of Edward, the footman.  Rose continues to serve faithfully, as do Mrs. Bridges and Hudson.  This series has a couple of episodes away from Eaton Place, two at Somerby Park, the aristocratic country home of some of James' worthless friends, and one, the final episode, by the sea as the staff takes a holiday.  By the time this series ends it is August 1914 and World War I is about to start.  The Bellamys and their staff prepare to soldier on.",1032652800,12,993,4.53932584269663
1232203,1,B00000JGDT,"This review is solely on the picture quality, not on the contents.  The people who gave it 5 star reviews probably did not pay actual money for the actual goods.  What is the point of having a good story when your enjoyment is destroyed by watching a horrible dvd picture.  Try watching this on a large screen TV and you will feel even more ripped off.  There are better things to do with your money.

I was seriously misled by the 5 star reviews.  These reviewers should put their money where their mouth is.  Check how many of them actually forked out real money to buy it.  They might have seen the material somewhere else, but not on dvd they paid good money for.  Even if the material is exceptional, as in this series, I do not think any one will be ecstatic after buying fuzzy picture quality.  Beware laudatory comments from someone who did not actually buy the physical goods.

I have nothing against the contents of the series. The contents merit 5 stars.  I buy lots of A&E and BBC stuff.  I read reviews that the first two series were bad in the dvd transfer.  OK.  I tried the third series.  The picture quality is still pretty awful.

If this picture quality is deemed acceptable, then the first two series must be absolutely horrible.  The picture quality is an eye strain.  Do not buy this if picture quality is of some importance to you.  Imagine watching a third or fourth generation video tape copy when lightning is going on messing up your electricals.  Well, this is how your screen is going to look like.  This kind of dvd is meant to be watched on small TV set.  If you watch it on a screen over 34 inches, you are going feel very shortchanged.

There is no English subtitling here.

There is something to be said for rescuing excellent TV series which would otherwise be lost to posterity.  Unfortunately, the sellers seem to rely only on this.  There appears to be no effort to spruce up the picture quality.  Sorrell and Son from Granada has about as bad a picture quality as one can take.  Buy Sorrell and Son first.  If you can accept the low quality, then downgrade to the Flambards.  And if you are half blind, you may then try Upstairs, Downstairs.

Hey, nobody is expecting Gosford Park picture quality.  We know the stuff is aged.  But this?  Unless you do not mind second generation video tape quality, and buying this solely on the strength of its dramatic contents.  The dialogue is excellent, so if you close your eyes every few minutes or so, you will reduce eye strain.  When you open your eyes again, chances are that the same characters will still be in the exactly the same position as when you closed your eyes last.",1031011200,6,2660,4.466666666666667
1232204,5,B00000JGDT,"Amazingly enough, I must admit that this series only improves with time. The first two seasons were riveting, but the third had me hooked; I watched every episode nonstop. The character development of James Bellamy is refreshing, as is the new blood introduced by Hazel. I can't wait to get my hands on season four, but I'll just have to be content to savor the first three seasons  in the meantime. Why can't current writers and producers get it through their jaded Hollywood skulls that this is the kind of entertainment that most thinking people long for?",1021334400,7,558,4.752577319587629
1232205,5,B00000JGDT,"We are enjoying this series as the newer DVD formats become available - about every 4 months. The 3rd series is particularly wonderful because it develops the characters in marvelous ways. The two country outings of James Bellamy, one alone and one with his new wife - reminds one of Gosford Park, with the same sorts of scheming, intrigues, trysts and fun. Hudson, Edward, James and Hazel are further developed. Christmas 1913 comes in with a two new actresses - one upstairs and one down, both providing color and adventures in both areas of the house. Although we give this series 5 stars, our feeling was that the first two episodes sufferred a little with video fidelity.
Still - it was wonderful. We have not seen the Upstairs Downstairs series in years, and can hardly wait til the 4th series (WWI) is available - hopefully in June or July.",1018137600,6,847,4.691275167785235

1232207,5,B00000JGDT,"The third season of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS opens in a midst of social change. It begins with a two part story, MISS FORREST, and A HOUSE DIVIDED, which deal with the tragedy of Lady Marjorie Bellamy perishing on the Titanic.  One thing that made Upstairs Downstairs so good was the real life effect.  People died and left, and the others in the house struggle to carry on, a  theme which runs through this season. It covers the pre war years  (1912-1914) in which James meets and marries the secretary, Hazel Forrest,  who is one of the best characters that was created. Rose also meets a man  whom she intends to marry, and naive but sweet Georgina Worsley also  arrives, along with Daisy, a maid who falls in love with Edward. Season  three is stronger than the previous installment, partly because of its  subject matter of the changing times. James and Hazel's troubled marriage  is heartbreaking to watch, as is the Titanic episode. Season Three ends  with another two parter, DISTANT THUNDER and THE SUDDEN STORM, which deal  with the beginnings of World War One, which would change everything the  Bellamy's and their servants believed in. Richard Bellamy sums it up in THE  SUDDEN STORM, ""This war marks the beginning of the end of everything  I've loved and lived for. We'll never be the same again."" These two  episodes are probably the best of the entire series. This season is one of  the best things ever on television, and builds up nicely to the fourth  season, not yet on video, which deals with The Great War. Another good  episode is GOODWILL TO ALL MEN, which deals with Georgina trying to help  Daisy's starving family. WHAT THE FOOTMAN SAW, which shows the beginning of  Edward and Daisy's romance, is highly touching. A very highly recommended  series.",944956800,13,1771,4.775577557755776

The budget for these shows must have been about three dollars per episode but it does not detract from the fantastic writing and the awesome acting.  This is just about the best TV show I ever saw.

Mike Bunkermeister Creek",1355961600,,395,4.6
1232221,5,B00000JGDT,"This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the recent remake ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and others.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.

The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).

I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Three is as intriguing as the previous two seasons though dark clouds hang over the Bellamy household. A terrible tragedy causes much strife and chaos in the Bellamy household. Son James falls in love with a woman not of his social class, and the staff downstairs are also experiencing problems of their own. Finances in the Bellamy household are tight this season and the residents of 165 Eaton Place are forced to economize, both upstairs and downstairs.

This third season of the show sees a death in the family, a marriage, a murderer putting the lives of the residents of 165 Eaton in danger, and the possibility of romance! The writing as always is engaging, and the plot lines keep me riveted to the screen! I am hopelessly addicted to this show now, and the new remake truly can't compare to the writing and acting in the original!",1332288000,,2499,4.940476190476191

1232223,5,B00000JGDT,"The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic nostalgic time-travel covering 1912-1914, pre-world war one.
Richard Bellamy (David Langton) and house heir James (Simon Williams) need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. ""You should feel very proud, Rose. Very proud."" last dialogue line to Rose, played by a co-creator of the series. It sums up the entire series.

1232224,5,B00000JGDT,"I started with Season Five to see if I would like the series, so I have the advantage of watching and appreciating the characters' growth over the previous seasons.  Season Three is the mid-point of the entire series and introduces new characters, something that probably contributed to the series successful survival into its fifth season.

I especially enjoyed the new character Hazel and her struggle to come to grips with the gulf that separated her middle class background from the upper class behaviors and attitudes of her prospective and later spouse, James Bellamy.  The fervent pursuit by the young James and his apparent willingness to defy the conventions of his ""station"" in life seem as gallant and romantic as a Victorian romance novel.  We are totally enchanted, but even as one feels happy for the couple, somewhere in the back of one's mind, there lurks the suspicion that life just doesn't work like that and that disaster will overtake the couple, as it ultimately does.  New to the series too is the lovely Georgina, step cousin to James and ward of his father, Richard.  Both of these ladies are probably some of the loveliest creatures ever filmed.  The red haired Hazel seems to capture the mythic of English womanhood, a lady of Shalott or a Guinevere, while the bubbly Georgina is a porcelain princess, the epitome of the pretty English girl from the Victorian period on. Each scene seems like a fine painting by a master.  This is also the point of departure for the matriarch, Lady Marjorie.  It was during this episode that I came to realize how much more about world history I knew than I thought I did.

Overall, this Season is one of a set of characters and actors who are comfortable with their roles and of an audience that is happy enough with them to keep coming back.  There is a perfect balance between the old and the newly introduced to keep one both satisfied and interested.  The subtle changes in society's attitudes, fashions, and technology give the viewer a strong sense of ""being there,"" gently pulling us along through time as it does in our own lives, while the mixture of personal and historic events give the whole a sense of context and its immediate impact.  The accidental and unexpected events of personal and world affairs diverts the course of the characters' lives, just as it does our own.  A major change happens, and suddenly nothing is ever the same again.",1282435200,,2418,4.767386091127098

Marjorie Bellamy goes down in the Titanic, Hazel Forrest becomes Richard Bellamy's typist and Hudson, the butler, almost quits. James becomes interested in Hazel, but, at first, she rejects him. Marjorie Bellamy's maid reappears. It was thought that she had been killed along with her mistress. The actress playing the maid gives an excellent performance.

1232228,4,B00000JGDT,"Which is not to say that this is in any sense bad television, I just find the 3rd Series of USDS to be the most melodramatic.  It certainly is a transitional season, which is never easy, with the introductions of three major new characters and the entrance/exit of scores of peripheral characters and story lines.  There is a lot of busy-ness here without as much to show for it at the end of the season.  Failed romances for Rose, Mrs. Bridges and Sir Richard?  A miscarriage between episodes?  It seems a bit rushed, as if the writers didn't know how to fill the time before the war.  The politics surrounding the war are introduced quite late, again making it feel rushed.  Yes, the episodes surrounding Lady Marjorie's death and the beginning of the war are among the most emotional of the entire series.  The writing, while a bit maudlin at times, kept up the continuity very well.  To my recollection, The ""Titanic"" disaster is referenced in every episode, at least indirectly.  They also capture the atmosphere surrounding the start of WWI, even the weather, quite well.  While not the best of the series, Series 3 of USDS is still better than most of what passes for television drama today.",1115078400,3,1198,4.684210526315789

7912106,5,B00000JGDT,"I suppose, when I first encountered the third series on Masterpiece Theater, in the fall of 1974, that it has always had a special place in my heart. Series Two was a bit tiresome, in my view, but it is here that the series finally found its voice. With the departure of Sarah, Watkins, and Elizabeth, we are about to see another departure, All the more extraordinary, since one character, a beautifully drawn and superbly acted one at that, does manage to salvage the entire series brilliantly. Meg Wynn Owen, the hired typist, Miss Forrest, employed by Richard Bellamy's secretary to work on a biography of his father-in-law, the late Lord Southwold, is nothing short of magnificent - her performance throughout this series and the following a tour de force. James Bellamy, immediately, has an eye for her and the first four episodes form an arc of what will happen, in the face of great tragedy and the changing of the guard at 165 Eaton Place. Each character has his or her episode in the spotlight during this series - Hudson, Rose, Mrs. Bridges, and two young ladies, Georgina Worsley, upstairs and under house parlor-maid, Daisy Peel, later in the series. Series 3 begins in the spring of 1912 and ends with England's inevitable engulfment into the First World War. The final two episodes of this series, in this writer's view, are flawless, and director Bill Bain won the Emmy for directing the last episode, ""The Sudden Storm.""  Acted to the nines, impeccably written and superbly directed, Downton Abbey can not lay a glove on ""Upstairs, Downstairs."" I find these comparisons tiresome, especially since writer Julian Fellowes purloined several of the plot lines from  UpDown. Those who know and love this series as I do agree, no matter how much money spent on DA costumes and scenery. Upstairs, Downstairs endures because it is ABOUT something. Downton Abbey? Well, it's been done before and so much better, in my view. One last note - be sure to have a listen to Jean Marsh, Simon Williams, Jacqueline Tong, et. al. and their commentaries on various episodes. It is great fun and only adds to the allure of this landmark and abjectly outstanding drama series. ",1449446400,,2172,4.833333333333333
