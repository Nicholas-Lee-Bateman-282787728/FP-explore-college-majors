7919994,5,B00004COUB,"I first saw this movie one day when I was alone with my grandmother, she usually likes watching LIFETIME and OXYGEN and other stations where they mostly play TV Movies and mostly drama and chick flicks. One day, we managed to turn on ""ARMED & INNOCENT"", A TV Film from 1994, I've researched this movie online, and from what I saw online, it was only released on VHS in the UK, which kind of suprised me. I was lucky to find a bootleg of this at a horror convention, I was so thrilled this guy actually had it, I got it in less than a heartbeat. Well, let me get into this film.

This movie is about a Southern family in the US. The eleven year old son is left home alone for alittle while. (This movie almost reminds me of a more dramatic home alone!) Suddenly, the house begins to get robbed by three robbers. The child takes a powerful gun, and shoots two of the robbers dead in self-defense, with the other scramming.

The father smothers his son as a hero, and won't stop going about how great he is, while his son is clearly traumatized. The mother (Kate Jackson!)worries about her son, as the son himself just sits. But un-knowingly to the family, the surviving robber attempt to go back on revenge on the kid joined by the leader of the group, who looks so much like Rob Zombie, for killing their two friends.

Im suprised this film does not have an actual release in the US. Its about a family living in the Southern US, so I wonder why it was only released rarely in the U.K. As I said, I got a DVD of it at a convention. This was a GREAT movie, and it was probably about two years after I saw it I repeatedly tried to look for it online, and had no luck, so about three years latr I was thrilled to find that bootleg of it. Its got a great dramatic ending, and a nice thriller/mystery film for you, mif you live in the UK and are reading this, look for the VHS, because this is a great film!

I give it 5/5",1279497600,,1916,4.14247311827957
