8157114,5,6304029985,"High priest of ""breastploitation"" Russ Meyer entered the biker film craze of the mid-1960s with this hyperactive tale of rape and murder in the California desert.

Alex Rocco is Cory Maddox, a veterinarian whose wife is defiled by a rampaging trio of moped-riding miscreants led by Brahman (Stephen Oliver), a crazed Vietnam vet.

 When the local sheriff (played by Meyer himself under the name ""E.E. Meyer"") claims that his wife invited her attack, Cory plots revenge on the hoodlums.

 Trailing them into the desert, he finds Ruby (Haji), a Cajun woman whose husband has just been killed by the gang.

 As the two gain on the homicidal trio, the gang begins to break apart, leaving Cory and Ruby to face-off against the violent, gun-toting Brahman.

 The lurid MOTORPSYCHO, is bursting with innuendo and sexuality, driving the film into carnal overdrive.
