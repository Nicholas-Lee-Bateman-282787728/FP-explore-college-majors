2290197,4,B0009GX20K,"I'll cover both the Do Not Adjust Your Set and At Last The 1948 Show.  I'm ecstatic to have some of these shows finally available in the U.S.  The 1948 Show includes the original Yorkshiremen sketch and Adjust Your Set is a must if only for the Bonzo Dog Band performances (including one with Eric Idle singing lead!).  The 1948 Show is the funnier of the two shows, but at only five episodes, it's a bit brief.  There are sketches here not so very different from what Cleese and Chapman would do shortly later in Python.  Every bit as good.  Tim Brooke-Taylor's chartered accountant's dance is brilliant (God knows how many Python sketches that inspired).  And seeing Marty Feldman makes me ache to get those shows of his that played in the U.S. one summer decades ago.  And of course the Yorkshiremen sketch is one of the great comedy sketches of all time (written by Brooke-Taylor and Feldman!  Take that, dead parrot!).  Adjust Your Set was designed to be a children's show and the humor tends to be juvenile for the most part.  But every now and then something slips in that screams Python (The shop sketch where ordering a long list of groceries gets you only a can of shoe polish.  The famous person hanging from a cliff.  A couple other sketches about irritating people where you can just see Eric Idle warming up for Nudge Nudge.)  And anyway, I'm a huge Bonzo Dog Band fan, and there are at least a couple performances of songs I've never heard before, songs never released on albums.

My problem here is the DVD packaging.  There is NOTHING in the packaging to tell me when exactly these episodes were broadcast.  The DVD packaging claims these are all recently discovered episodes.  So are these the only 5 surviving episodes of The 1948 Show?  Plus just what does recently discovered mean?  The first episode of Adjust Your Set I have on tape from years ago, a copy from a copy from a copy, originally recorded off UK Gold before making its way to the U.S.  I know for a fact these aren't all the surviving episodes of Adjust Your Set.  Am I to believe these are all the surviving episodes from the first season?  The packaging of Adjust Your Set also lists Terry Gilliam as animator.  But Gilliam's name only appears in the credits on episode 3 and there is nothing like the cartoons for which he is famous.  There is in fact no animation at all beyond a few special effects for Captain Fantastic.  Goofy, too, is that the same Terry Jones and Tim Brooke-Taylor interviews appear on both sets.  Why?  It feels like a rip-off.  Couldn't there have been a bonus episode of The Frost Report or Marty Feldman's show?  The Do Not Adjust Your Stocking episode?

I'm also curious to know if these episodes are considered to be complete.  At least the first episode of The 1948 Show lists people appearing in the show who aren't in the episode on DVD.  Is it just that the credits were wrong?  (At least the DVD's appear to be complete episodes rather than some sort of highlight reel.  I appreciate that a great deal.)

So, complaints, rather than hitting on the head.  Nevertheless, I'm hoping they put out the other Adjust Your Set episodes.  The Do Not Adjust Your Stocking episode (or was it a special?) is the only other one I've seen and it is much funnier than the early episodes.  And it actually has some famous Gilliam animation in it.  And how about those Marty Feldman shows?  Any other 1948 episodes?",1123027200,43,3420,4.55008210180624
2290198,5,B0009GX20K,"The waits over for you Python completests. At last ""DNAYS"" is on DVD, something I thought would never happen. It seems that material was found of the episodes, but maybe not complete episodes. You see, the BBC used film with already recorded show over again. This was the cause of the loss of priceless footage of what would be in a short time, in my opinoin probably the greatest television show of all time, Monty Python's Flying Circus. Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam from that team are here, already performing sketches that seemed to echo into Python. Also included on the DVD are interviews with Terry Jones of Python. Since according to the information, there's only two hours of material here, we'll only have to wait for more sets, possibly a Don't Adjust Your Stocking DVD too. Keep em' comin'.

Of course, the Bonzos are amazing. Viv Stanshill is up there with Mick Jagger as the best showman. I picked up ""Cornology"" and I love it.
Note: As another voter mentioned, there are songs here that aren't on any Bonzo album. They are:

Captain Fantastic is the highlight of the series and seeing a young David Jason with future Pythons Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle is brilliant. Denise Coffey is excellent as well.  I was surprised by how funny it still is after all these years.",1379980800,,357,4.476923076923077
2290202,3,B0009GX20K,"The DVD disc set Do Not Adjust Your Set is a collection of nine broadcasts by a team that includes about half of the future Monty Python team and the deliberately surreal the Bonzo Dog Do Dah band. It is intended as a companion piece with a separate DVD set: At Last the 1948 Show. In case there is any doubt about that the included advertising and the special features interviews are exactly the same in both sets.

Between the two, DVDs Do Not Adjust Your Set is not as funny. There is some suggestion that this program was intended as a children's show which may explain some of its lack of adult appeal. I cannot see it as being warmly received by grammar or even middle school students. This is also not Sesame Street. There is no shortage of slapstick and the ongoing episodes of Capt. Fantastic might appeal to the superhero fan seeking a satire. Ultimately the humor is a mismatch of sophistication and curbed punches that are likely to fail all age groups.
The antics of the Bonzo dog Doo.band are definitely a value-added feature. I had hoped to report that their rendition of the Monster Mash was the debut of this satirical piece but alas they not the original artists for this song. They did engage in a very wide variety of creative, comedic, and strange music-based sketch pieces. I would like to think they were in early subversive influence on later British rock idols by inspiring them to don outlandish makeup and costumes. I have no evidence to support this but if true it would make for nice story.

I enjoyed seeing Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Tim Brooke-Taylor (guest appearance), working an early form of their later Monty Python madness. Terry Gilliam is present as an animator but not in his signature unique surrealism meets, comedic form.

Given my general disappointment with Do Not Adjust Your Set, my strongest recommendation is that this is for those of you who, like me have an interest in enjoy the antecedents of the Monty Python team. Several of the skits will return in a funnier, better form once the full M P team assembles.",1372550400,4,2077,4.623306233062331

2290204,4,B0009GX20K,"I bought this set (which in the UK is included with ""At Last The 1948 Show"" but here in the USA for some reason ain't) so my daughter could see what ""real kid's TV was all about"".

She is now convinced I had a deprived childhood.

I think anyone who didn't see the show the first time around wouldn't get much from this set, which showcases content badly degraded from neglect and 50 years in a leaky basement. The footage has stood up surprisingly well, with none of the frame roll and sound dropout ""At Last The 1948 Show"" suffers from in places, but Oh, what a cheap show it was.

The cast of the show was: Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, David Jason, Denise Coffey and the 1967-ish lineup of The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.

One rather sad issue is that the musicians' contract at the time called for (I believe) a new backing track to be recorded but the vocals to be performed live. This is problematical since Viv Stanshall is not at his best in some of the showcased tunes, especially my beloved ""Look Out There's A Monster Coming"". The Bonzos are often left looking perplexed by the bizarre situations they are put in by the script, and today's viewers may not understand the blackface number is a parody of a show that was current at the time DNAYS was first broadcast that would not get airtime today.

The whole thing is saved for me by David Jason and Denise Coffey as the arch rivals ""Captain Fantastic"" and ""Mrs Black"".

Yes, you'll see some wonderful sketches that were so good I remembered them all these years. You'll also see some clunkers. And everything was aimed somewhere around the 12 year old age demographic. You are duly warned.

There *is* a rather neat, if short, custom version of the Bonzo's ""The Intro and the Outro"" which a collector would find worthwhile I think.

And you may recognize stuff that made it into the later show, Monty Python's Flying Circus. The last episode, for example, is clearly the inspiration behind ""Election Special"".

This set is series 1. I don't know what happened to series 2, and why it isn't in the same set. You do get a couple of interviews on disc 2, one with Terry Jones and one with Tim Brooke-Taylor (little known in the USA but a mainstay of great comedy in the UK). Perplexingly, both interviews mainly concern the missing discs from the USA set - the ones containing ""At Last The 1948 Show"".

Worth what I paid. Four stars only because of the obvious idiocy of irrelevant interviews and splitting the set.",1288224000,3,2481,4.517857142857143
2290205,5,B0009GX20K,"In Britain in the late 60s, television was still at the relatively primitive stage where it was necessary to flash up a message from time to time that there was a technical problem in the transmission and that you should not try to adjust your set.  There must have been a similar thing in the US, to judge by the ""There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture"" in the Outer Limits opening.  The phrase made a great title for the brand of zany comedy that Do Not Adjust Your Set brought to children's programming in Britain.

I was older than the target audience, but I was soon hurrying home from work to catch as much of it as I could.  It's good now to be able to watch the whole thing at leisure, on DVD.  I think today's kids may still get something from it, but it's more of interest to an adult audience, wanting to see the early efforts of Idle, Palin and Jones, future Pythons.  Yes, it is essentially a children's show, so make allowances for that.

The musical guests were the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and if you haven't seen them, you should.  They are unique.

David Jason was a member of the cast, he and Denise Coffey being the 'real' actors among them.  He's surprisingly awkward in some sketches, and very physical, with little indication of the great comedy actor he was to become.

Tim Brooke-Taylor makes a guest appearance.  He went on to become one of The Goodies, in my opinion the greatest TV comedy series of all.  (Why are they so poorly represented on DVD?)

Inevitably, some of the references will be lost on a modern or non-British audience.  For instance, the parody of the White Heather Club, a long-running Scottish song and dance show, is excruciatingly funny, for those who saw the original.  Still, I'm sure anyone can enjoy it.

I was looking forward to seeing the insert, a 'Comedy Tree Poster Booklet'.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be a totally incomprehensible tangle of arrows and labels which tells you nothing about how the British genre of zany, surreal radio and television comedy evolved from The Goon Show through to the present.  The chart even includes shows like Cheers, simply because John Cleese made a guest appearance, and it totally ignores radio shows.  This is a pity, because a tree with The Goons, Twice a Fortnight, At Last the 1948 Show, Do Not Adjust Your Set, I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, The Goodies, Monty Python, etc, showing how the whole thing evolved, would be really interesting.

This DVD is recommended for all comedy lovers who are in the mood for some childish fun.

2290206,5,B0009GX20K,"It was great to find this DVD to see what the pre-Pythons were doing before their groundbreaking show, Flying Circus, and to see the Bonzo Dog Band since there aren't many videos of them since there weren't camcorders in the 60's. This really gave the Bonzos some exposure they needed. I think it was said that even grown-up tuned in to this children's show because of the Bonzos. Let's just hope the BBC will finally release The Innes Book of Records. You'll never see Rutland Weekend Television on DVD. Eric Idle won't approve it.",1241827200,,532,4.670212765957447
2290207,4,B0009GX20K,"This short-lived BBC series is, indeed a proto-Flying Circus, with the core of the Monty Python crew waiting for John Cleese to arrive. Many reviewers have mentioned that this was originally intended as a children's programme, which in effect meant that the comedy skits, while often quite similar to the later versions that would appear on ""Monty Python,"" are mainly different because of their brevity: the same kooky tone is present, but the ensemble generally quit a skit at the simplest iteration of the joke, whereas in the later shows, they would have things get much weirder and let the jokes go on and build up to greater degrees of absurdity, with the excessiveness of the repeated punchlines being a big part of the humor. Still, it's pretty cool to see Idle, Jones and Palin testing their craft. Probably more immediately gratifying is the extensive footage of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, which generally performed 2-3 songs per show, in a variety of daft concepts and weird clothing: for fans of the band, this collection is a clear must-have, and a great chance to see Vivian Stanshall and cohorts in their early glory years.

That said, I'm not enthralled with the Bonzos... I know the UK hasn't excised the ""minstral show"" as here in the US, but sheesh!  I wasn't ready for that, and am still forwarding through those scenes.

Four stars for the sketches, but the blackface is just too shocking for me to even put in the rating.",1177891200,,514,4.494623655913978
2290209,4,B0009GX20K,"Maybe my title is a bit off. On second thought, you may have to adjust your expectations ever so slightly. The problem here is that the show is being marketed as ""the classic series that lead to the creation of 'Monty Python.'"" (Of course so is ""At Last The 1948 Show,"" which actually is more prototypical of ""Python."") If you are expecting the level of sustained cleverness or wit found in ""Python,"" you may be somewhat disappointed; if you view this for what it is, you will be pleased.

""Do Not Adjust Your Set"" began as a children's show, but with elements that would become trademarks of ""Python"" such as sketches with non-linear elements, no conclusions, absurdist twists, etc. The show began to gather a wide adult audience as well and it is obvious that over time the show became more geared toward subtle adult humor. The three proto-Pythons (Palin, Idle, and Jones) are the standouts here (of course) while David Jason (a British actor who is best remembered from the ""Captain Fantastic"" segments in every episode, and who later went on to become the voice of a toad in a television production of ""Doctor at Large"" in 1971) is middling. He has some good lines, but falls short of the other three guys. Denise Coffey is the token female cast member, and is by far the weakest of the five, though nowhere near as bad as Aimi MacDonald on ""At Last The 1948 Show.""

The other big feature of the show is the musical presence of the mysterious ""Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band,"" who are extremely odd performers. Although they never perform my favorite of their songs, ""Canyons of Your Mind,"" they do perform some amazingly unusual musical numbers, including ""Love is a Cylindrical Piano,"" ""Death Cab for Cutie,"" ""Tubas in Moonlight"" (which features and early musical adaptation of silly string,) and their notorious musical intro, this time adapted to have Terry Jones performing with toast. (You'll just have to see it.) Overall the Bonzo's are a mixed bag, some of their numbers are merely boring, but some of the more unusual ones are worth their weight in gold. Speaking of music, I found the ""Captain Fantastic"" segments (a spoof of older serials) to drag and not be that amusing, though I did like the concept of a ""horrible handbag"" that could end the world, and was greatly amused by the walking tree. The one thing that I can't forget is the theme song to the segments: I warn you, if you watch ""Captain Fantastic"" you will almost assuredly get the theme song stuck in your head for an extended period of time.

The show is definitely worth watching, especially if you are interested in the early careers of Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Eric Idle, just realize that you aren't buying ""Monty Python,"" you are buying proto-Python for kids with a pit band. For those that may be animation fans, the box claims it is ""featuring original animation by Terry Gilliam."" While I know that Gilliam did work on the show, I never noticed it in these episodes, and if it is here, it is certainly in extremely insignificant quantities.

I recommend this without reservation to fans of ""Monty Python"" or other fans of period British comedies, but outside of that group, this set will have fairly limited appeal. As for me, I love ""Python,"" and I enjoyed it: four stars.",1171152000,5,3262,4.6975524475524475
2290210,5,B0009GX20K,"I gave this video five stars because it is the only thing I've seen yet that has actual moving pictures of the Bonzo Dog Band.  Being that they weren't on TV in the US at all during the 60's, it is quite amazing to be able to see them here in all their original glory. I was completely open mouthed amazed with all of them. Vivian of course was a major howl, but the rest of the lads were right up there with him.  Roger Ruskin Spear in particular was a major scream.  Rodney Slater was a real oddity as well and Legs Larry was hilarious.  So was Neil.  It was just so amazingly great to come upon this.  Like coming upon a time capsule.  There is quite a bit of the Bonzos throughout these shows.  Unfortunately, most of it is not done live, however it is fascinating to hear a lot of their songs in developmental stages. There is almost an hour and a half of Bonzo material on these disks. There are no chapter stops except for the beginning of each show.  There is no copy guard either, so it is possible to assemble all the Bonzo clips on your own disc. This is what I did using a hard disc DVD recorder.  It all worked out beautifully and made the purchase of these DVD's very much worth it.  As for the comedy bits with all the others on the show, well, there are a few things but it really is truly amazing how much improved things got when the Pythons became the Pythons.

But the grainy black-and-white sketches are hit and miss and some of the stuff here is simply awful (latter-day TV detective David Jason's Captain Fantastic is a waste of time and Denise Coffey is nothing special). As well, Terry Gilliam, later the animator for Python, is credited with some writing but is nowhere to be found, either in person or in cartoon form.

For Python completists, this is a must-have. Same goes for the John Cleese-Graham Chapman show from this same time, At Last The 1948 Show.",1158796800,4,804,4.742857142857143

Watching the episodes that comprise the set, you can see what Idle, Jones & Palin brought to Monty Python.

The other worthwhile aspect to this set is seeing the Bonzo Dog Band w/Viv Stanshall in their 1960's glory. Although I have heard that the Bonzos have recently got back together & are touring England w/worthies such as Stephen Fry, there is nothing that can quite replace the absurd brilliance of Vivian Stanshall. To me watching the Bonzos perform on video on this set is like finding video footage of ancient Egyptians walking around the Pyramids. You get glimpses of what the Bonzos would have been like when they played live. The fact that this set is in glorious black & white instead of dull drab color gives it an almost Victorian patina from a time which is as distant from today as the 1920's were in the 1960's.

(The later episodes on the set begin to show more fully-developed sketch ideas - so perhaps the second season of DNAYS, which featured Terry Gilliam's animations - and which are NOT presented here - better represent the show).

Still, DNAYS is fascinating - like discovering a hidden gem from someone else's past. The best bits throughout this volume are probably the crazy songs by the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band (good enough to make you want to look up one of their CD hit collections). It's also nice to finally see David Jason (a legend in the U.K., but a virtual unknown in the States) - who is quite good at physical comedy, and Denise Coffey - a likeable actress with a great comic presence. Their `Captain Fantastic' vignettes are probably the most memorable part of the show.

2290216,4,B0009GX20K,"""At Last the 1948 Show "" + ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"" = ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"".  Really.

There are skits on these DVD sets that are as funny as those by Monty Python.

I have read since the 1970s that British viewers of Monty Python recognized the cast from earlier TV series such as these.  Pythons John Cleese and Graham Chapman (along with Marty Feldman!) starred in ""At Last the 1948 Show"" (with a few small parts by Eric Idle).  Pythons Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin starred in ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"".

""At Last the 1948 Show"" was, as seen on these DVDs, very much an on-stage skit program with lots of dialog.  In contrast ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"" had a lot more outdoor location scenes and special effects for more of a visual gag-type program.

""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" was the next step in a growing community of comedians in the U. K.  Surely this is what British viewers must have thought, at least some.  Here in the U. S. the initial exposure of Monty Python came with no advance warning.  It was a delightful shock.  In fact most of everything Monty Python had released by the mid-1970s (TV series, movies, books, records, live stage show) was dumped on the American market at about the same time.  It was pretty amazing.  We just didn't get to work-up to Monty Python by first viewing TV series such as ""At Last the 1948 Show"" and ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"".

After the years of reading about the numerous pre-Python TV series it is nice to finally see some.

It might be worth noting that the picture and sound quality of the shows (particularly in the case of ""At Last the 1948 Show"") were probably a bit clearer than seen on these DVDs.  I am very sure that what are seen here are cinescopes of the original programs.  Cinescopes were made by placing a film camera directly at a TV monitor and filming live or video tape TV programs directly off of a TV screen.  Once made the films were permanent.  The original video tapes of these programs very likely no longer exist as British TV and radio producers were notorious for reusing video and audio tape through the 1970s leaving no archive copy of many TV and radio programs unless they happened to be cinescoped, often for broadcast in other countries like Australia, for instance.  Many fondly remembered British TV shows originally recorded on video tape are long gone.  When shows like these finally turn up in any form, fans can be thankful, as I am.",1124668800,3,2448,4.515909090909091
2290217,4,B0009GX20K,"In 1968, one year before ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" Eric Idle & Terry Jones were approached by producer Humphrey Barclay (who knew Idle from Cambridge revues & Jones from Oxford revues) to do a kid's TV show which would also feature the abrsurdist Bonzo Dog Dooh Dah Band (featuring Neil Innes of future ""Rutles"" fame).  Desperate to gain exposure as performers as well as writers (having previously written for, among other shows, ""The Frost Report""), they hastily agreed.  Jones automatically brought in his writing partner, Michael Palin (another Oxford revue alum), and, at Barclay's suggestion, the cast was rounded out with two non-University performers, Denise Coffey and David Jason (who would go on to the classic series ""Only Fools & Horses).  The writers of the show (Idle, Jones, & Palin) agreed not to specifically write for children but to simply write what they found funny.  And, thus, ""Do Not Adjust Your Set"" was born and quickly developed a following among adults as well as kids.  At the end of it's first series (there would be two in all), an American animator/writer, Terry Gilliam, would join the fold.  Among the show's many admirers were two writer/performers of ""At Last the 1948 Show,"" Graham Chapman & John Cleese, who knew the Idle, Jones, & Palin as fellow ""Frost"" writers.  The following year, the two camps got together and ""Python"" was created.

  Unfortunately, as was the standard practice at the time, after being broadcast, the video for the programmes were erased and the show was lost to time.  Or so was the belief until recently, when a handful of the shows were rediscovered and, now, released on DVD.  So, now that the history of the show is out of the way, the question remains, ""Is it funny?""

  The answer for me is, ""Yes,"" but it's not as funny as Python or Chapman & Cleese's ""'48 Show"" (which has also rediscovered and released on DVD concurrently with this title).  Being for kids, many of the items are more cute than side-splitting and certainly a lot less harder edged than Python would be.  Noticeably missing is the darkness and savagery of Python, which was clearly brought to the table by Chapman & Cleese (and is visible in the ""'48 Show"").  The pieces tend to be on the juvenile and zany side with quick blackouts abounding.  All in all, it's very much like ""Laugh In"" but with a more English sensibility.

  All of the performers are very good and mesh well together.  The Bonzos especially stand out with their oddball musical numbers.  There are 9 episodes here and they are all of a consistent quality.  I very much enjoyed them but can't say that I was doubled over in laughter.  And, much to my disappointment, there are no Gilliam cartoons on this release, despite him being listed in the credits of one episode.

  The main problem is that all of the performers are rather diminutive and cuddly and, thus, there are no real authority figures for them to play off of.  Idle is the most authoritarian of the bunch but no one is near as upright, straight, or fearsome as Chapman & Cleese could be.  This X factor gave Python much of its strength, where, for example, putting an irritating Palin together with an exasperated Cleese could produce a ""Dead Parrot"" sketch.  ""At Last the 1948 Show"" does not suffer from this problem as Chapman & Cleese's co-stars, Tim Brooke-Taylor & Marty Feldman, were smaller in stature and played a different range of characters from Graham & John.

  David Jason & Denise Coffey have a running serial, ""Captain Fantastic"" that is reminiscent of silent films that is amusing but overdone.  From a historical viewpoint, of course, the show is fascinating... you can see Idle, Jones, & Palin developing the characterizations and ideas that they would later polish to perfection in ""Python.""  Don't get me wrong, every once in a while, there will be a great scene and the tone for the whole show is light and fun.  It's just not as hysterical as ""'48 Show"" or ""Python.""",1123372800,11,3969,4.773861967694566
2290218,4,B0009GX20K,"The highlight of this set for me is a healthy helping of the great Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, who present a song or two and plenty of lunacy in each episode.  Fans of Neil Innes, The Rutles and Vivian Stanshall will want to pick up a copy just for The Bonzo's contributions.

One complaint:  Why did this, and ""At Last The 1948 Show"" need to be pricey double DVD sets?  Both would have fit easily on one double layered DVD each.",1123286400,3,425,4.146341463414634

8060493,2,B0009GX20K,"This DVD is a must for true fans, such as I, and I won't even watch the ""Secret Policeman's"" things they threw together so many years ago.  But I have to be honest, these are not hilarious sketches, with only a few good laughs.  Unlike one reviewer, I'll do the right thing and only review this collection, and not ""At Last the 1948 Show.""  This is a different show, different performers, and the lesser of the two.

Imagine the worst sketches of M. Python, and then go down a notch, and you'll have the best of these bits.  Very amateurish at times, by our reckoning, and there always has to be a ""straight man,"" who hams up his confused exasperation as the rest of the characters say silly things and behave in silly if predictable ways.  This was one thing these writer/performers learned was unnecessary and most unfunny in later work.  One doesn't need a ""normal"" character to show the audience just how odd the others are behaving.

This is good for a history of how these talented people (some of them are talented, anyway) honed their craft.  Take a look at what passes for comedy elsewhere in Europe or even at other times and places in Britain, even today, and you'll understand that this was a time of experimentation and breaking down of their cultural inhibitions.  This show has all the sophistication of a modern community college comedy troupe from Montana.  But this was coming out of a world of 3rd grade comedy.  You can see where they will go, but they aren't there yet.

I will end this with a joke about my people:
Q: How many Germans does it take to change a light bulb?
A: (In heavy Bavarian accent)  It takes only vun.  He takes ze old light bulb out and screws ze new one in.  What iss dis, sum kind of a joke?",1434758400,3,1736,4.411949685534591
