5092001,5,B007K01OGW,"When I saw that the seasons of, ""The Amanda Show,"" were released to DVD, I knew I had to get them. As I have watched most of these episodes when I was young and recently with the 15 episodes available on iTunes (most of them from season 1 and 2), I decided to purchase season three first because the lack of it on iTunes. I was skeptical of purchasing this where it was being made on DVD-R recordable media discs, but I am 100% satisfied! The set looks as if you went to the store and purchased it. The box art is of the display picture that Amazon has for the product, both of the discs have 'The Amanda Show' art on them, which is great! The packaging is great as well, as both of the discs have their own spot! I would recommend getting this product if you were a fan of the show back in the late 90s or even a newcomer. You won't be disappointed with the show or the quality of the packaging!",1336867200,2,896,4.067796610169491
5092002,5,B007K01OGW,"If you were a kid in the late 90's like me, chances are The Amanda Show was on your criteria of shows to watch every night! I was stoked when I saw that Amazon had all three seasons on DVD! I ordered seasons 2 and 3! I got my order right on time, the quality of these DVDs are great, and of course Amazon packaged my DVDs wonderfully! I'm really pleased with my purchase. Thank you, Amazon! :D",1334880000,9,393,4.051282051282051
5092003,4,B007K01OGW,"I had to take off 1 star for something I noticed. I remember the skit fluently from my childhood, so in watching, I can see that some episodes may have been cut. The skit is with Courtney learning to play the piano. After scaring away the music teacher, Courtney goes to her window to call her friends over for a house party, where she then plays the piano fluently. But on the DVD, the skit ends with the music teacher running away, and Courtney smirking. But, the following house party portion did not happen.

So, chances are there are other episodes that may have been trimmed, and thus not the full original episode that aired on Nick.  But other that that, the DVDs seem sturdy and the video quality is superb.",1436918400,5,716,4.458015267175573

8518558,4,B007K01OGW,So funny! Love watching drake and josh together aswell as the numerous skits. The season drake and josh are working together more in scenes and it just shows you what is to come.

8518566,1,B007K01OGW,"I purchased all three seasons of the Amanda Show.  The first two season DVDs worked as expected.  The Disc 2 of Season 3, was defective,  The DVD froze about 1/3 of the way through playing it, and does not move forward. Unfortunately, I was unaware of this, as I don't sit and watch the DVDs with the person I bought them for.  I discovered the problem after the return deadline, and am stuck with the defective disk.  I would advise anyone purchasing these DVDs, in particularly, Season 3, to check for this problem, within the timeline for returns.",1448150400,,550,4.571428571428571
