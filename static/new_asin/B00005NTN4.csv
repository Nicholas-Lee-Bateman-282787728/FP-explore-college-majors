1637746,3,B00005NTN4,"A word of advice to all you fellow travelers: don't talk to men staring at you in the restrooms. Half of you will respond,""well, duh."" For the rest of us who use urinals, I expect the same reply. And when you see ""Harry"" you'll wish he took that advice.
Harry is a quirky character who'll grow on you like he did Michel, who is the husband of Claire and father of three very young girls. A classic scenario: the hot, sticky station wagon, whiny kids and no consolation for the vacationing family in August. Harry is an old friend from college. Michel is never clear that he remembers him, but Harry recalls vivid details of Michel's creative, academic and amorous conquests. And Harry shares them openly with Claire, wife/mother and previously unenlightened partner. Well, with a friend like Harry...
You might be inclined to fault Harry for his misguided generosity until you notice that others give Michel unwanted gifts during this vacation. Wish you had the hero's troubles? Don't be too hasty.
 Harry seems to have it all: money, freedom, a lover and a mission: he's driven to bring Michel's life back on course. And he may be the motivational coach from hell. Chris Farley's character from ""a trailer down by the river,"" would be a welcome relief.
Michel's parents add to the soup with their own passive-aggressive/ manipulative style. Dad's a retired dentist who won't drop drilling as a lifestyle as his wife's snide remarks attest.  And they have their own way of inappropriate gifting that is their fatal flaw.
Both the hero and the title role draw out the worst and the best in each other. This dysfunctional relationship takes us well beyond the bounds of imagination, elevating Michel while tormenting Harry. All this and a happy ending too?
The female characters in this film remain undeveloped and I would like to see more than the one dimension of Claire or Plum, Harry's beau. Most of the women are dispatched so handily leaving me with distaste for the director's treatment of women. Those who know French cinema will probably enlighten me.
Nevertheless, the film grew on me, as perhaps it will on you as well. And with a friend like Harry, who needs... CrCy",994032000,3,2176,4.784574468085107

The man tells him that he is an old friend from school. Michel doesn't remember him but the man has perfect memory of their past and Michel believes that he once knew this man. The man addresses himself as Harry. Harry seems to know all about Michel and even many things that Michel doesn't remember himself. He remembers a girl that they both dated and even recites an old poem that was written by Michel. He stands too close to people, insinuates many things, and asks questions that no one feels comfortable answering. Harry's way of getting into people's lives feels like he is violating them. Harry is not a very likeable person but Michel feels enough comfort with him to have him over for dinner. Michel(Laurent Lucas), his wife Claire(Mathilde Seigner), and his three noisy daughters are on their way to their summer cabin and Harry(Sergi Lopez) and his fianc Plum(Sophie Guillemin) follow. Michel has an exhausting life, from taking care of his daughters to humoring his parents to working on his family's cabin which definitely needs a lot of work. Returning to their cabin, Michel finds that his upstairs bathroom has been entirely redone, in pink. It is a gift from his parents but he feels that they should have asked him first. He hates the color and wanted to work on his house his way. Are they bad people for giving him this gift. Whether it is grotesque or not is besides the point. It could be said that they did something wrong by redoing his bathroom in a color that is not suitable for a cabin without asking him, or that they shelled out their own money to give their son and his family a nice bathroom. Harry notices all of the things that make Michel's life hard and decides to change them, but in a prying sort of way. He tries to mold Michel's life in the way that he thinks he would be happiest. Is he a good person for trying to make Michel's life better or is he not. He does these things without asking or even knowing if Michel would want them done. He assumes that this will all help him but the question is: does it really? We do not really know who Harry is and neither does Michel. All that we know is that he used to go to school with Michel and that he is obviously obsessed with Michel's  life. From the beginning the film feels like a thriller, but we are not sure why. Is it the creepy music or the way that Harry acts with Michel? Is Harry the real villain or does he just bring out the worst in people with his manner. These questions are all posed when we first meet Harry and they are all answered. ""With a friend like Harry"" is by far one of the best films of this year.

1637756,4,B00005NTN4,"As far as thrillers go, `Harry un Ami Qui Vous Veut du Bien' (With a Friend Like Harry) really succeeds on a lot of levels.  It is chilling, unnervingly so, and the ending is ridiculously well timed and unveiled.  It kind of takes you by surprise and adds layers to the films already intriguing plot.

That said; the film does lack in certain areas that could have made it even more chilling.  Because of the fact that this films premise is not your usual thriller foundation (the one to be feared is a more intimate acquaintance) the film really needed to expound on just what it was that made Harry tick like he did.  While the audience surely can place certain pieces of the puzzle together, it would have been more advantageous for the director/writer (Dominik Moll) to have fleshed it out a little clearer for us.  We really want answers to the obvious questions (WHY DID YOU DO IT HARRY?) but we aren't supplied them.

Still, `With a Friend Like Harry' manages to deliver in areas most important, most notably the thrill department.

The film follows a young married couple with three daughters who are vacationing in a home they are currently renovating.  When a chance encounter with an old friend passes the uncomfortable `first stage', things get even more bizarre as this friend, Harry, latches on and refuses to let go.  What seems like mere `helping' turns into a form of terrorizing as Harry does what he sees fit to `help' his long lost friend.

What makes the film work more than it should is Sergi Lopez's fantastic performance.  As Harry, he slowly yet deliberately unveils just enough to keep the audience equal parts fascinated and repulsed.  We want to know more, yet we want him to go away.  Mathilde Seigner is also phenomenal.  Laurent Lucas is a tad stiff, which was part of the character but also could have been loosened by a stronger hold on his character's emotional shifts.

In the end, `With a Friend Like Harry' nails the most important things, creating a memorable thriller with real teeth.  It isn't perfect, but rarely is a film in this genre, so it's forgivable.

By the way; beware of the English dubbed version of this film.  The voices are obnoxious and unrealistic and take away from the film entirely.

1637757,2,B00005NTN4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Harry' is a story about an ordinary middle-class couple, Michel and Claire and their three young children. They're on their way to visit Michel's parents when they pull over at a rest stop. While Michel is in the bathroom, he's approached by Harry who identifies himself as a long lost high school acquaintance. Harry alludes to a poem that Michel wrote in high school along with a sci-fi novel as well as pointing to an incident in which Michel chipped his tooth while rough-housing during a soccer match.

The problem is that Michel is unable to recognize Harry and this crucial plot point doesn't really ring true. It's unlikely that Michel would forget about Harry completely especially when we later learn that Michel's dentist father did some bridge work for him and Michel's brother Eric also can recall who he is. Somehow, the film's scenarists implausibly suggest that Michel has become emotionally stunted to the point where he's lost some of his basic memories.

Harry is traveling with his bimbo girlfriend, Plum, and manage to get themselves invited back to Michel and Claire's summer house (the trip to Michel's parents is cancelled when one of their daughters develops a fever). Before you know it, Harry and Plum are sleeping over. Harry is positively creepy as a good number of his conversations involve one kind of sexual innuendo or another. Claire is a bit suspicious but Michel passively allows Harry to insinuate himself into their lives. It becomes obvious that Harry is totally obsessed with Michel, especially when he keeps encouraging him to start writing again--an avocation Michel dispensed with early on during high school.

At first it appears that Michel will become the target of Harry's creepy obsession. But soon we see that it's Michel's parents Harry has it in for. He ends up showing up at their apartment late at night pretending that Michel is in trouble and coaxes the parents to follow him in his car to Michel and Claire's. On the way, Harry maneuvers his car behind the parents' car and manages to push them off the road, down a cliff. While the parents are killed, we never learn why. The only clue that's offered is that Harry was upset over some poor dental work that Michel's father was responsible for in the distant past.

The death of the parents puts Michel into a tailspin. He closets himself away in the bathroom and begins obsessing about trying to finish his 'Flying Monkey' short story which he began in high school. Claire pays a visit to Harry at a hotel where Plum and he are now staying. She mentions to Harry that Michel is trying to write again and crazy Harry thinks that's a good thing. But Claire also makes it clear that Harry's no longer welcome back at the house. Meanwhile, Michel's brother Eric has shown up for the parents' funeral and Harry ends up doing him in too.

The denouement makes little sense. Harry returns to Michel and Claire's summer house and kills Plum after she tells him she wants to start a family. Instead of hiding the body himself, he asks Michel to help him dispose of it by throwing it down a well in the front yard. After Michel helps Harry to dispose of Plum, Harry then simply asks Michel to help him slaughter Claire and the kids. Did you ever hear of a serial killer who becomes obsessed with one family member but wants to kill everyone else? In real life, serial killers end up killing everybody but not here! Michel comes to his senses and stabs Harry with a knife; he then throws him down the well and then shovels dirt so that the bodies will not be found.

All's well that ends well when Claire asks Michel what happened to Harry and Plum and he tells them they had to leave but left ""sending their love"". The upside is that Harry stoked Michel's creative fires after all. He begins writing a new novel entitled ""The Eggs"" (Harry earlier had spoken approvingly of eating an egg every morning to help with virility). Claire tells Michel she read his new story and thinks it great that he's begun writing again.

One problem is left unexplored. What happened with the investigation into Eric's disappearance? Wouldn't the police start poking around after Eric's friends start asking about him? And wouldn't they look at Michel as a possible suspect, especially after the recent mysterious deaths of their parents? Some internet posters have offered the dubious theory that Harry is actually the altar ego of Michel and that he is the actual murderer. I don't have the space to debunk that theory here but plenty of well-informed postings refute the entire fanciful idea.

'A Friend Like Harry' expects you to figure out Harry's motives in trying to kill Michel's family as well as his obsession with Michel without much evidence. Yes, there are a few tantalizing clues thrown out here and there but the antagonist's motivations are intentionally left quite vague. And the fact that Harry makes no effort to hide his murderous nature from Michel at the film's end is almost laughable.

'Harry' is a bit slow-moving but basically keeps your interest until the climax. Sergi Lopez can do little in the part of the demented Harry since the script calls for a character that's not plausible. Equally implausible is the character of Michel who never seems to have a clue that Harry wants to do harm to his family until the very end. Director Dominik Moll is obviously aiming for some Hitchcock-like suspense but leaves us with characters that do not add up in the end.",1273104000,6,5509,4.741127348643007

The performance of every actor is suberb, in particular that of the  Spanish guy Sergi Lopez(Harry, our friend). this story is not as usual about murders. This film has a special kind of quality in many aspects.
I want to mention as a remarkable fact, the song listened by Harry (the murder). This is ""Ramona"" sung by the Mexican Diva Dolores del Rio. It is strange but I love it ! This song is so ancient but I think it was a very good idea to include it as a part of the sound track. Congratulations !",1221264000,3,543,4.221153846153846
1637760,4,B00005NTN4,"Harry is one of those over-friendly people who seem to have no idea when they're getting too close to someone else - being too intimate, invading privacy, and taking inappropriate liberties. We get this about him from the start, as he makes his first move - in of all places a men's room - and the creepiness sets in long before we sense that he's more than a little obsessive, if not totally psychopathic.

Set in an isolated old farmhouse in the hilly, wooded French countryside, the story has misadventure written all over it, and viewers can gleefully let themselves sink into 2 hours of growing dread as Harry stealthily goes to town on the innocent family he adopts - all with a well-meaning smile on his face (not to mention the occasional odd quirk) and a sweet girlfriend by his side.

1637761,5,B00005NTN4,"An intelligent and unsettling domestic thriller, Moll's ""Harry"" turns a man's frustrated writerly ambitions and confused existence into grist for another's twisted--and ultimately homicidal--handiwork. The suspense hinges partly on how Harry's logic-warping speeches to Michel fuse the psychology of self-realization with psychotic rationalization. Quietly dispatching anything standing in the way of Michel's long-suppressed dreams, Lopez inhabits the role of sinister motivational expert with dark charisma. Wickedly entertaining, with a perversely humorous kick, ""Harry"" is a troubled house guest you won't mind entertaining.",1185753600,,628,6.670731707317073
1637762,5,B00005NTN4,"With A Friend Like Harry is one of those exceptionally well done thrillers that demonstrates a certain artistic quality that so many poorly made, mass produced thriller movies lack. The convincing acting, the weird plot developments and the stress everyone seems to be under in this film make it a true thriller masterpiece.

The movie begins its creepy quality from almost the beginning of the film. Imagine! Michel (Laurent Lucas) is on a trip with his wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner) and their three daughters to their rundown summer cottage and just by pure coincidence (???) Michel meets someone he went to school with: Harry (Sergi Lpez). In a matter of minutes the eager to please and modest Michel is already feeding into Harry's plans for him. Michel and his wife Claire let Harry and his girlfriend Plum accompany them to their summer home which they are renovating. Almost immediately you are stunned by the fact that Harry buys Michel and his family a SUV seemingly without wanting anything in return. Things do move in the first hour--but they don't move too fast. The director, Dominik Moll, makes sure that the scenes, acting and music slowly set you up for a creepy thriller roller coaster even if during the beginning there isn't a cloud in the sky.

Predictably, it's not long after Harry shows up (really just a few days in the film) that things in Michel's family begin to go horribly wrong. People drop like flies and eventually even Michel himself begins to have his doubts about Harry. Harry claims he just wants Michel to write again unencumbered by the stresses of his family responsibilities (the three girls, his wife). Is it that simple?

We never get a definitive answer to that question. Harry, of course, is a psychopath madly obsessed with Michel and Michel's writing. Is Harry planning to ultimately kill Michel after other people have died? Why does Harry continue to come by even after Claire's visit to him in the hotel where Harry is staying with his girlfriend Plum? We never really know with any certainty. In addition, I like the point one reviewer makes when they write that Michel's dislike of the SUV could represent French disdain for Americans. Is this absolutely clear in the movie? Of course not.

And therein lies the immense power of this film. The fact that we never know the answers to so many questions increases the power of the film exponentially: not unlike a piece of abstract modern art, Harry, Michel, Claire, Plum, and the others can be viewed differently by different viewers and still have meaning. Every viewer may interpret events and people as they personally wish them to be. Awesome!

The convincing acting stuns me; I even had goose bumps at one key point in the movie! The cinematography shines its best with the panoramic vistas of the French countryside; and the choreography doesn't falter once.

The DVD comes with few extras besides some unrelated previews for other movies; this is a disappointment but the brilliant film glows so brightly that I will forgive this disappointment.

In short, With A Friend Like Harry gives its audience a five star, first rate thriller. I disagree with others who say that there's comedy in the movie--the ""creepiness factor"" is so high from the very beginning that I focused on that alone.

I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes thriller movies with their inevitable plot twists and unexpected turns. I hope that you get this film, savor it and think about it for some while to come.",1185667200,,3502,4.844481605351171
1637763,2,B00005NTN4,"This movie was too ""in-your-face"" to be a thriller.

It lacked any finesse.  It was not polished and in the end, I felt a little cheated.

I have many of the movies done by Alfred Hitchcock & David Mamet.  I find their movies well directed and have some genuine tense moments that leave you guessing what's going to happen next.

This movie however is about as subtle as a kick in the groin.  The acting is passable but certainly not as enjoyable as a Hitchcock or Mamet movie.",1180742400,,477,4.363636363636363

After reading reviews and watching it again many years later, I'd agree that the Harry character is supposed to represent the id or dark side of Michel's personality.  Those evil impulses that everyone has and suppresses either because they want to or have to are in this story personified in Harry.  Harry goes on to act out these evil impulses.

Some clues: Michel first meets Harry while looking at his reflection in the mirror.  Michel's conversations at night in the kitchen with Harry sound like a guy debating conflicting ideas in his own head.  No one comes looking for Harry and Plum at the end.  By the movie's end it seems that Michel has sold himself out or given in to his dark side in some way - I guess that's the main point.

1637765,4,B00005NTN4,"Michel and his wife are making their annual trek to a rural farmhouse they purchased a few years ago in the French countryside. Every summer, they spend their vacation there, fixing it up. Their three young girls sit in the back seat of the hot car, complaining, crying and venting their misery. Finally, Michel decides to stop at a gas station and freshen up. There, he runs into an old friend, Harry, whom he does not recognize, but Harry certainly recognizes him. Harry remembers the poem and short story Michel published in the school newspaper over twenty years ago. Harry invites himself to their farmhouse for a drink. Harry and his girlfriend, Plum, soon become guests. Slowly, they learn about Michel and Sophie's life. Harry, financially well-off, decides to buy them an air conditioned SUV.

""With A Friend Like Harry"", the new French film released by Miramax Zoe in the United States, is a very interesting, fun film.

Virtually every newspaper ad for the film quotes a reviewer who compares the film to Hitchcock's works. Comparing a film to a classic is always a tricky concept. Comparing a film to the work of someone as revered as Hitchcock usually illicits snickers and derision. ""With A Friend Like Harry"" is the first film I have seen in some time that is worthy of such comparisons. It isn't as good as Hitchcock's best, or even his good, but it does reach for the same level of suspense that Hitchcock was able to achieve over and over again.

""Harry"" also relies on the same suspension of belief that Hitchcock relied on frequently. Can a man mistake a woman that he had an intimate relationship with simply because she has changed her hair color? Can a man solve a murder while bound to a wheelchair in his apartment? Can a man survive a cross country hunt? In ""Harry"" we have to believe that a man will recognize a classmate after twenty years and feel strongly enough about him to help him change his life. The actor playing Harry, Sergio Lopez, reveals the layers of his character in a very restrained manner. Slowly, we realize that the character is deranged and psychotic, but we don't learn this from a foaming mouth or long diatribes.

The actor playing Michel is also very good. He brings a quiet desperation to the role. He is a family man who has never realized his dreams, but he knows that he now has responsibilities and carries on.

The rustic French farmhouse is an ideal location. A bit surrealistic, it allows the characters to act differently toward one another. Slowly, as Michel changes, he seeks solitude in the newly remodeled bathroom, a pink horror that his parents have commissioned in the little farmhouse.

""With A Friend Like Harry"" is a very good, very suspenseful, enjoyable and, at times, funny film.",1113350400,,2754,4.739039665970773
1637766,4,B00005NTN4,"If only you didn't have all these distractions, then you would write that work of genius, which your high-school doodlings clearly anticipated, and your life would be marvellously fulfilled.  Or, failing that, you could buy that ridiculously large, environmentally disastrous, SUV, the one with the air scoop on the bonnet, and, boy, your life would be just great.

*

OK. So what happens if these simplistic wishes are magically realised?  Not much.  But dramatising this idiotic frame of mind to which, it seems, pretty much all of as are prone to, can produce a blackly comic movie.

*

The director, Dominik Moll, presses on the whole mentality of seeing life as a series of problems with solutions.  It's a mentality he allies with the mistake of reducing the complexity of the world to a falsely simple and falsely circumscibed realm, a realm in which one can potentially be master.  Thus we have the figure of Michel's father, a dentist, who finds fixing his son's teeth much easier than fixing their mutual relationship, and who keeps a vivid memory of Harry's dentition, but of little else.  Of course, this is a tangential example, for the focus of the film lies with Michel and his alter ego Harry.

*

Michel has his problems.  The children, his finances, the strain on his marital relationship, his domineering parents.  If only his rich father could simply support him (and then die, leaving him to look after the estate), and if only he were childless, and his wife, rather than being an equal, were a subservient concubine: wouldn't life be free of problems?  He would have Harry's life, including the big black Mercedes. Not only would he consume his fair share of eggs, he would suddenly have his creative forces unleashed from their bourgeois chains, and works of great literary power would roll forth.  Heaven help those who did not take his poetry seriously, such as his wastrel brother: death shall be summarily dispensed with a crowbar to the head.  Yet pouring forth this wealth of literary gold, while hunched upon the throne in his fuchsia coloured bathroom, might cost Michel his wife and children, and this might be (slightly) too high a price to pay.  So better spare their lives and take the Mitsubishi 4WD and ditch the Mercedes and the sex-kitten (in a deep well). This is, roughly speaking, the lesson Michel learns as he journeys through the film.

*

It's kind of worthy, but also, I thought, a bit too obvious and didactic.  Youth aspires to creativity, and middle age to security.  If you actually did kill all the people you momentarily think you'd like out of your way, then, even if no punitive repercussions follow, you'd still have problems.  Yes, right, fine.  Good points and, along with the critique of problem-based living, enough to sustain a decent film, but there's something a bit trite about it all, and something a bit wearing about the film's style.  Still, perfectly watchable, although the genre of the suspense thriller is, ultimately, a less than perfect disguise for the true intent of the film.

*

One review rightly mentioned this being a variant of the Faust legend, and another speculated that Harry was not real, but I'm surprised that most just assumed that this film is basically macabre realism.  Even more surprising is the claim that the characters are well drawn.  Hardly any 'realistic' questions are asked about the 'characters' of Harry and Prune, which is just as well, as no answers, of a 'realistic' nature, are to be had - Harry has no motivation of his own (of course not, he is a voice, an aspect, of Michel) and Prune is the sleepy sexual shell of a woman (a fantasy, Michel's if not others'). All these external representations or embodiments of a character's internal psychology are typical moves in French films, yet they are not recognised as such by the majority of viewers (see The Piano Teacher, Baise-Moi, and countless more for variants on this scheme).  Should the film-maker be even more obvious?  It's sad to even ask this question.

*

Parallels with Hitchcock have been made.  For mine, Hitchcock was far more obtuse with his psychological correspondences - his stories worked better on the crudely realistic level.  Yet clearly there was heaven knows what lurking underneath.  With Moll, the underneath is far too close to the surface (but, again, my criticism could well be reversed, given the apparent response of  much of the film's audience).

*

Another way of expressing Moll's point would be to say that Michel can't see all the things that make his life truly his life, a failing that we all share, and ironically one that is, in a sense, manifest in the typical response to Moll's film. The film then can be taken as a warning against wish-fulfillment, or, more interestingly, as a warning against seeing life as a series of wishes to be fulfilled, but also as an exploration of the limitations of the imagination.  As an example of the latter, perhaps one reason people dream of the  death of their parents for some ulterior gain (as we can take events in the movie dramatising) is because they can not imagine what their world would be like after such a grievous loss - it is literally unimaginable in detail, with the emotions and reactions only dimly anticipated; nor are people great at imagining the actual taste of their life in the wake of great success (thus Michel/Harry gets what he wants, but in the dream world of the movie it remains starkly unreal, unsatisfying, and hardly worth  aspriring towards).  Another tale that explores all of this, in a completely different manner, is Shakespeare's Macbeth.  Indeed, all Shakespeare's tragedies can be read as such explorations.  Which is definitely not to say that Moll approaches Shakespeare, but at least he is trying.",1110067200,,5784,4.845213849287169

I give it 5 stars because it is eery and laid out very well.  If you enjoy thrillers, you MUST pick this up!",1103932800,2,422,4.109756097560975
1637768,4,B00005NTN4,"Michel (Laurent Lucas), a French ESL teacher on holiday with his family, unexpectedly runs into Harry (Sergi Lopez) when the family stops for lunch on the way to their remote country house. Harry recognizes Michel immediately as a former school acquaintance and the author of ""The Dagger in the Close of Night,"" a poem Michel wrote in high school and which Harry has memorized. Michel does not remember Harry at all but invites him to spend the night with the family in the country. The relationship becomes more complex as the stay is extended, and both Michel and Harry begin to change. Suspense builds, leading to a grand climax.

This darkly amusing noir drama is filled with irony. Michel and his wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner), two ordinary people, are the parents of three screaming and bickering little girls, and they never seem to get enough time together, so their invitation to Harry is surprising. They need a vacation, yet they are reluctant to ask Harry and Prune, the stereotyped, clueless blonde (Sophie Guillemin) accompanying him, to leave when they stay too long. Harry is distressed to see that Michel no longer has the leisure or the motivation to write but has no clue that this may be a choice, and he actively encourages Michel to resume writing, even while in the bathroom. Other obvious ironies evolve with ensuing events.

Directed by Dominik Moll, who also wrote the screenplay with Gilles Marchand, the film develops slowly. The accident of Harry's meeting with Michel is so bizarre that the viewer may wonder if the meeting is a set-up, and Harry's motivation for his strange behavior is not completely clear, both problems creating more a sense of puzzlement than suspense.

Matthieu Poirot-Delpech's cinematography of the setting in southern France and David Whittaker's romantically moody piano and string music help create a sense of mystery. Sergi Lopez is a terrific Harry, a bumbling and seemingly good-hearted admirer of Michel, and Laurent Lucas as Michel is a suitably frazzled and somewhat overwhelmed teacher on vacation. The film is fun to watch, but I found the lack of clarity regarding motivation to be a problem in the building of suspense and the black humor not strong enough to carry the rest of the film (3.5 stars) Mary Whipple",1102809600,,2280,4.963350785340314
1637769,4,B00005NTN4,"The opening scene to this film is what immediately pulled me into the story, characters, and emotions.  The consistent nagging of our main character's children pulled not only at Michel's mind, but also deeply into ours.  This sets the stage, while already having your emotions and sense heightened, for the meeting of Harry, Michel's counterpoint in the film.  A classic combination of American Psycho and Swimming Pool, our two characters and everything surrounding them pull us in every direction.  From confusion, to suspicion, to fear, and even disbelief, we watch as a simple friend, and unknown acquaintance becomes so deeply rooted in this struggling family.  Director Dominik Moll has done his homework in this genre and successfully creates a film that not only tantalizes, but also settles in deep inside you releasing snippets of fear throughout the story.  His camera angles, structure, and deeply rooted character development make this little, almost unknown, thriller a step above the others out there.

As I said before, Dominik Moll does a great job directing.  It is obvious from the opening credits until the chilling ending that he is very comfortable with the genre and the material.  There are some amazing scenes that boldly stick out in my mind, and that is a great sign that the director has gone well beyond his duties to create a powerful film.  Outside of the direction, which does stand on its own, we also have some of the best casting around.  Sergi Lopez literally steals every scene in this film.  His charisma, quiet demeanor, and sinister eyes keep our eyes focused directly on him at all time.  Moll gives us nothing about Lopez's Harry, which makes him even more watchable.  He is curious and slippery all at the same time.  We are never quite handed the reason for Harry's persistence with Michel's writing or the back-story on how these two met (the circumstances that apparently effected Harry's life), and it works in this film.  I am notorious for needing more stories to accentuate the characters, but in Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien, none is needed.  The suspense is built by not knowing and it really sends a chill up your spine.

Talking a bit more about the characters, I loved the way that Plum was handled.  Who was she?  Why did she always seem to know what Harry was doing?  To me, that was some of the more frightening elements of this film.  Plum had a secret, and I really wanted to know what it was.  You can never trust Harry, which makes me wonder what was the truth and what were lies that he spoke about.  Strangely, the way that I saw it, Harry never lied.  Outside of the dirty deeds that he sometimes did, he was a pretty honest guy and I think that was his way of winning over Michel's support.  On a side note, could you not see this film being remade using Robin Williams as the role of Harry.  After seeing him in One Hour Photo and Insomnia, I could see him pulling off a role similar to this (also, Lopez sometimes looked exactly like Williams).  Oh well, it was just a thought.

What kept this film going was the simplicity of the story.  It was obvious that Moll used the ever-popular direction known as ""K.I.S.S."" (Keep It Simple Stupid) to keep his audience focused on the characters that were in front of them.  This was a character-based film that, like an onion, had layers upon layers of emotions.  There were no elaborate sets, no twists and turns, no sudden jumping that would detract us from the story, it was a simple story with amazing characters, nothing more ... nothing less.  For this film, it worked.

Finally, I would like to take you on a thought journey if you wouldn't mind.  Think about this for a moment as you finish reading this review.  I thought of this after watching the film and as I typed this review.  What if there was no Harry?  What if Harry was just a figure of a broken man's imagination?  From the opening scene we see the tension that Michel is feeling about his life and family, why is it impossible to think that perhaps he created Harry out of thin air to help him through the rough times.  We all think of times in our lives that we wished we could go back to, perhaps Michel's time was when he was writing.  Writing seemed to ultimately make him happy, so why not dream of a way of getting back there.  When it got to scary for Michel (breakdown was pushing him away from those that he loved), is when he had to deal with Harry.  I know there are logistical issues with this thought process, for example conversations and so forth, but it was a thought I had as this film seemed to wrap up.  Maybe others feel the same, perhaps I am crazy, who knows ... only I will know when I approach you as a lost friend next time you are at a rest area.

Overall, very impressive work by everyone involved.  I thought that the story was tight, the characters were immensely disturbing and exciting at the same time, and the images decorated the film very well.  I would suggest it to anyone that loved Swimming Pool, the structure is very similar ... except one is sex and the other is writing.  They do go together ... don't they?

1637770,5,B00005NTN4,"Every human being has a unique talent, but the question is whether the person recognizes the talent and cultivates it.  Throughout life people are faced with a decision that will influence their life and this decision could have devastating affects on the growth of unique talent.  Sometimes the person might only need a little help to get started, but in extreme occasions the person might need drastic changes in order to nurture their exceptional skill.  With a Friend Like Harry pinpoints this notion in an eerie suspenseful drama where an unfamiliar person has established that the talent exists within the person and strangers decide to make sure that the skill is refined.

Michael (Laurent Lucas) is a school teacher and family man with three daughters, a car with too many miles, a summerhouse that is in dire need of restoration and an income too small to afford a change of life style.  The situation is increasingly stressful for Michael who wants to deal with all of his hassles by himself.  The stress in Michael's life also leads to strain between him and his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner).  On a trip to the summerhouse when the children are crying and complaining about the heat in the car, they stop for refreshments.  When Michael visits the pit stop's bathroom he bumps into a man who appears have been in the same school as him in his adolescence.  This man is Henry.

One of the first things Henry asks Michael is whether he is still writing as he remembers his writing from high school.  Michael, who barely has time for himself, has not written since high school.  Later the audience witnesses Henry in a bizarre scene where he recites a long poem, which Michael wrote in high school.  Henry, who defines himself as a problem solver, as he has unlimited amounts of time since he has a small fortune which he inherited from his father, wants to help Michael to get back to writing at any costs.

Dominik Moll directs a well-written script into a first-rate psychological thriller where the help goes too far as it proves to be lethal to anyone who stands in the way of Harry and his mission.  The cast also provides an excellent performance as the characters feel genuine, to which the audience can relate.  Last, but not least, the mise-en-scene is brilliant as it elevates the impression that each scene has on the audience.  For example, Michael's parental intrusion into his life is brilliantly depicted through the pink bathroom that they have provided for their son and his family.",1099612800,2,2512,4.777777777777778
1637771,3,B00005NTN4,"This thriller is an excellently made film.  I won't go into all the reasons here, as they're covered in most of the other reviews.  The best thing about it is that it's in no way predictable, but neither is it unbelievable.  The directer gave it a great atmosphere.  While one is watching it, it's difficult to put a finger on exactly what's unsettling, but it is.  I gave the film 3 stars because it's not for everyone; even those who like thrillers (like myself) may be slightly turned off by the protagonist's actions.  For me, the conclusion and his actions (which I won't reveal here and spoil the film) left me unsatisfied.

1637773,4,B00005NTN4,"WIith a Friend Like Harry is a silently terrifying psychological thriller that builds from a sedate family story into a suspenseful horror scenario with the use of spine-tingling cinematography and simple acts of manipulation. There is almost no violence in the film, and the shock value is minimal. Instead, the film relies on the piercing reality of the story it tells, on the intuition of its viewers, and on good old-fashionedscared-of-the-dark fear.
In the frenzied heat of midsummer, Michel (Laurent Lucas), his wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and their three young daughters are on vacation, headed toward their summer home. Much in need of a some relaxing time off, the family retreats to the secluded stone country house they bought a few years back. Though they have been working hard to restore the place, it has a few minor hazards that need fixing--such the deep, empty well hidden in the back yard. However, before the family even arrives at the house, they encounter Harry Ballestero (Sergi Lopez), who claims to have known Michel in high school. Though Michel doesn't quite remember Harry, he remembers Michel with intense clarity. Harry can recite from memory the poetry Michel wrote for the school journal, and treats Michel like a brother. So begins the family's odd relationship with the smilingly intense Harry and his flaky girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), who impose themselves on the family with suffocating congeniality.

While the plot is one that has been done countless times, the film slowly manages to build a sense of overwhelming claustrophobia and jolting suspense. The ending is creepy, made even more disturbing by keeping all the secrets a secret. We never know what motivates the characters to do what they do, adding an extra sense of unease and fear to the story. It comes as no surprise that many people did not like this film, it is definitely not for all tastes, but for anyone who likes unsettling thrillers will enjoy this. It's a standard plot that turns itself into a pretty good thriller.",1086998400,,2039,5.0325443786982245
1637774,3,B00005NTN4,"This quirky little French thriller blends the squirming discomfort of watching ""Chuck & Buck""'s unabashed adult-aged schoolboy-on-schoolboy crush with ""American Psycho""'s disturbingly casual mayhem. Michel, a young, harried working-class father vacationing with his three screaming kids and cranky wife has a ""chance"" meeting at a highway rest stop with an ""old school chum"" named Harry who does not seem readily familiar. Harry, a Trustafarian slacker with his trophy girlfriend in tow, rapidly proceeds to completely ingratiate himself into Michel's life, and things become, well, (in the interest of avoiding any ""spoilers"") let's just say, quite ""interesting"". Newcomer Sergi Lopez, who plays the oddly charming yet psychotic Harry with brilliant understatement, could easily become this generation's Dirk Bogarde (compare Lopez's character with the late Bogarde's in the psychologically similar ""The Servant""). The film could have been tightened up a bit, but still has more substance than 90% of the Hollywood ""thrillers"" cluttering up the multiplex these days. Fans of Hitchcock and/or deadpan black comedy (a la Jarmusch or Lynch) will get the most entertainment value out of this one.",1053475200,,1193,5.707865168539326
1637775,4,B00005NTN4,"First of all, if you're looking for a good scare then you'll hate this movie.  If you're looking for a black comedy that will make you feel guilty to laugh and chuckle at some rather unpleasant goings-on, then I can't think of many other films that will fit the bill!  This movie doesn't come out and tell you what it's about--it leaves it ALL up to your imagination.  And that is the un-American genius to it (we can't seem to do this in American film anymore).  Obviously Harry is a nut (because he's a killer), but do his motivations seem that ""off""?  Not really, and that's why this is a black comedy and not really a thriller.  His motivations aren't really out of lust, greed, or hate, which is what makes it rather disturbing.  It makes me think of a Macy Gray song:  ""you are relating to a psychopath, your role model is in therapy, you must be real far gone, you're relating to a psychopath"".  That's what this movie is like.  You get a chance to hang out with a pyscho--and actually get along with him.  It's pretty wild.  But don't expect any hair-raising thrills--they do not happen here.
I also got the feeling that this movie is also making very subtle jabs at the Americanization of Europe.  Like when Harry bought the 4x4 for Michel and family, Michel didn't want it because he thought 4x4's (we call them SUV's here now) were ""vulgar"".  But he soon enough accepted it, seemingly undisturbed by the fact that his values were pretty easily sold out.  Consumerism is making its way to the rest of the world.  If you're unhappy, buy a product and enjoy the few minutes of relief it buys you.  If it buys you more time (like the 4x4 did), then to hell with your values if they were compromised.  These things are not uniquely American, but I think Harry in a way represents the modern American influence on old Europe.  Harry did mention that he had some dental work done in America, so we don't know
So there's a lot of things to pick apart in this film.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I still feel it's a little too obtuse to be a perfect film (plus it is really nihilistic--was Michel relieved by what happend to his parents???).  Maybe I'll see it again in the future and will change my mind, but right now 5 stars doesn't seem right.  But it's really a stroke of genius, though you'll never be able to fully explain why.",1042416000,11,2340,4.3930232558139535
1637776,3,B00005NTN4,"...I won't go into overall plot rehashing. I'd just like to add my 2 cents on the motivation of Harry. Everyone seems to be mystified, but I thought it was obvious (and hilarious). Quite simply, Harry thought Michel was a literary genius. The new Shakespeare. An untapped writer of extraordinary talent. The poem Michel wrote had completely captivated his mind. He adored it and lived by it (See Harry's reaction to Michel's brother when he mocks it). The only other work by this genius was a barely-started work of Science Fiction called ""The Flying Monkeys"". Harry was going to see that that story was finished NO MATTER WHAT!!! He HAD to know the ending! NO ONE was going to get in the way of that story being finished.  The great, and scary, part of all this was that the poem and the story were written by a teenage Michel who hadn't given either one of his works a second thought in 20 years.
 The only question for me was, was their initial encounter ""coincidental"" or ""staged""? I'll have to watch it again sometime and look for clues.",1025568000,3,1042,4.566844919786096

Think ""David Lynch without the psuedo-intellectual nonsense"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock without the melodrama.""",1019952000,,414,5.0144927536231885
1637779,2,B00005NTN4,"OK, OK - I should have known better.  Haven't I been burned by enough highly acclaimed French films?  But ""Harry"" had real promise: a true thriller - not the standard foreign-film avant garde mumbo-jumbo.  With highly favorable reviews comparisons to ""Momento"", and even Hitchcock, how could this possibly miss?  Regrettably, it did.
Sure, the premise is interesting enough: a rich and eccentric supposed acquaintance from long ago (Harry) mysteriously shows up and immediately begins imposing unsolicited favors and gifts on Michele and his family.  So far, so good.  But beyond an annoyingly realistic portrayal of the ""joys"" of automobile travel in a hot car with three young kids, the plot was thinly developed, and the story just a bit too unbelievable to inspire any real credibility.  The acting: typical French aloof indifference to what was actually supposed to be happening on the screen.  And while Harry had sufficient ""creep"" factor and mystique to hold one's casual interest, the viewer's curiousities about him are never really fulfilled.  In the end, I was left frustrated by the lack of explanation of Harry's ultimate motivation, and his fanatical fascination with the husband/father, Michele. Is Harry crazy?  Sure he is - but that alone is shallow excuse for avoiding explanation and closure of the story.  With the irony of a Hitchcock or the surrealism of a David Lynch, this could have been a great film. But unfortunately, neither are evident.  In summary, it is your basic ""'friend' helps man trade his mother, father and brother for a new car, becomes a killer, and finds true happiness"" kind of story line.  As an offbeat alternative to the standard stuff Hollywood fare, I'd skip this one and recommend either ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Momento"".",1019606400,5,1770,5.125435540069686

1637782,5,B00005NTN4,"A deeply unsettling movie that left me reeling after watching it.  Who says a scary movie needs a bucket of blood and a plateful of gore?  In the tradition of Hitchcock whose idea of shocking somebody is through his mind, this movie pays homage to the great director with the greatest flattery: imitation.
Even the plotline is somewhat a reminiscince of ""Strangers on a train,"" a chance encounter between Michel, the protagonist of the movie, and Harry, a long forgotten schoolmate, leads to deaths around Michel.  The ""criss-cross"" theme of Hitchcock's classic is well preserved and I won't go into details to avoid spoiling the movie for you.  The well-timed orchestral music could also easily lead to mistaking this for a Hitchcock's film.
I can imagine any director getting over-excited about a psychological thriller like this.  ""Let's thrown in a few clues here to explain the motivation,"" I can hear a less seasoned director say.  However, Dominik Moll did a fantastic job keeping the film consistent and simple (plot-wise).  The acting is also impeccable; well deservedly, Sergi Lopez was awarded a Cesar (French equivalent to the Oscar) for his role as Harry.  One complaint is that the film seems to try too hard to keep the tone low-key.  It results in an ending that is rather weak (execution, not plot-wise).
Like Hitchcock, Moll is not interested in laying out a map to a killer's mind.  He would rather bother you with the unexplained, after all it is more fun that way.  From watching 'Psycho' we would never know why Norman Bates becomes what he becomes, yet he is probably one of the most talked about movie characters in history.  Similarly, part of the suspense here is to figure out what makes Harry ticks and why.

1637783,4,B00005NTN4,"With a Friend Like Harry takes quite a while to reveal itself.  It's establishing a tone and the relationships of those you are going to be involved with.  The film has a lot in common with
Hitchcock in how it takes its time (like say Psycho did for instance) in deciding to tell you what is going on.  When you start realizing what is going on... the suspense starts to increase.  I was ahead of this film through most of its running time, but that worked in terms of building suspense as well because the characters are ones you are interested in and care about.
I'm purposely not going to tell you much about the film.  In terms of re-counting plot synopsis' there's not a great deal to this story of a married couple who bump into a helpful stranger and his wife, a stranger who had gone to high school with the husband.  He's odd, but seems friendly and reveals himself to be very quirky but seemingly friendly.  There's wonderful details and ironies to be discovered (perhaps on your second viewing) within this film about it's characters.  Gee a film where you are actually interested in the characters--imagine that.  It slowly builds And reveals and has a few tricks up its sleeve.  The film is character based and does not rely on Any over the top type set pieces.  You might say it's quiet that way.  Quiet in the way an early Polanski film like Cul de Sac was.  The tension builds, slowly and methodical until you're more than ready for almost anything.
Direct Dominik Moll cannily manipulates the audiences in how he places his actors and uses his camera.  He captures the tensions of a normal life with an accuracy that rings so true you'll identify at least in part with Michel, (Laurent Lucas), and his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner, sister of actress Emmanuelle Seigner) and their 3 children.
Michel is a very modern and updated version of the hen-pecked husband. We'll come to realize that in his effort to be 'fair' and in trying to please others, Michael has completely lost himself.  He's buried his dreams and lets others use him as a doormat.  His children, his wife and his parents have all played a part in overwhelming him and when he has a few spare moments to think about what has happened he resents the way his life has become something not his own.
Harry  (Sergi Lopez)  bumps into Michael in a roadside restroom and recognizes him.  They went to school together didn't they?  When Michel and Claire's  car breaks down,  Harry and his rather vacant but sexy girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin) offer them assistance.  Thus begins what at first seems like an updated variation of The Man Who Came To Dinner  as siphoned through one of those Pacific Heights, Single White Female, Or The Hand that Rocks the Cradle films.  Most of those tried to mimic Hitchcock with mixed to poor results.
This film however has as much in common with Hitchcock as it does with an early Polanski effort such as Cul de Sac.  This is a good thing.  On the surface most of the characters seem Average, but then we begin to peel off the layers.  The film is pretty easy to predict but there are twists that work quite well.  For the most part the twists are believable and do not de-rail the film into some kind of slasher film histironics as often happens with films in this genre.
The acting is all top-notch and the situations build convincingly.  What may be difficult to fully accept are the motivations driving Harry to insist on being Michael's friend.  Perhaps an extra layer could have been revealed to better convince us, Harry has reasons we can almost identify with for doing some of the things he tries to do.  I can make up (in my mind) a few elements of a back-story to make it work very well indeed.... But it would have been nice if the script-writer had added another layer, and put it on the screen.  Some are going to find the film strains credibility to some degree and it won't connect with them and be as effective as it could have been..  The characters in this film I'm happy to say don't seem to be used merely as convenient devices for a clever stylish film. They act, sound and behave as normal people do.  You don't see this very much in the movies anymore.
NOTE:
The film is absolutely destroyed if you watch the dubbed in English version of the film.  The voices who do the dubbing are poor and have terrible phony inflections that utterly ruin the tone, texture and mood the film creates.  I don't care how lazy you are feeling, you are doing yourself and the filmmakers are real dis-favor by watching the English dubbed version of the film.  Watch it in French, the subtitles are easy to read and any effort you might put forth by doing so is well worth it.  After you've seen the film if you want to go check out how awful the dub version is, go right ahead.  You'll see within a few minutes what I'm talking about and I hope you'll wait until after you see the film the first time before checking the dubbed version out.
DVD STUFF
With A Friend Like Harry is presented in an anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, and the transfer is very well done.  The  flesh tones seem to be slightly on the orange side but it's done on purpose and reminds one of the older 50's type of color films such as Vertigo or Rear Window.  The colors are slightly over-saturated and tend to bleed slightly but the black levels are very strong and everything appears very clear and bright.  I notice very little grain, dirt, dust of scratches on the print used for the transfer.
Both the French and awful English soundtracks are presented in full Dolby Digital 5.1.  Stick with the French soundtrack and read the subtitles.

Going into too much story detail will spoil the viewing experience.
Even a simple summary does not do justice to the dangerously wicked unfolding of the story that starts when two guys Michael (Laurent Lucas) and Harry (Sergi Lopez) bump into each other in the men's rooms of a rural gas station.  It seems they went to school together but haven't seen each other for at least a decade. Harry vividly recalls some good times that  don't seem to mean much to Michael.
Harry and his fiance end up at the country home of Michael, his wife and two screaming kids.  Michael tells Harry, who is rich, about the pressure of helping his aging parents and problems with his scheming brother.  This is a slick, ironic, taught, cynical, intense and unexpected thriller, minimalistically written and stylishly directed by Dominik Moll. Finishing the implied title phrase (""With a friend like Harry ... who needs enemies?"") is not giving away any secrets because in actuality, scary Harry is only the id to Michael's ego. Watch it in French with English subtitles, it's even better.  Or worse.  Depending on your frame of mind.",1006128000,2,1325,4.81057268722467

I seen the movie Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien, it is brilliant and actors are very good.
It is a psychological thriller about the inner world of a man, (and it is hard to understand what is happening for real and what not), is a movie who talks about the influences that can mine our lifes and make us die slowly.
I suggest this item to any lover of good cinema.",1005523200,2,486,4.072916666666667
1637787,5,B00005NTN4,"Clearly released in the USA with a different title (in the UK it's ""Harry, he's here to help""), this film was the best French film of 2000. The blackest of comedies, it's understated,  stylish, and brilliant. What's it about? If one begins to explain the plot, one will spoil the film. Just buy it and be completely absorbed for a couple of hours. Then thank your lucky stars that you don't know Harry, or anyone like him. Or do you...?",1004572800,,436,4.45
1637788,5,B00005NTN4,"Dominik Moll's taut, sardonic thriller begins quite simply.
In the men's room of a gas filling station, Michael (Laurent Lucas) finds himself reacquainted with Harry (Sergi Lopez), a high school chum he hasn't seen in years.
They chat. They talk about the good old days.
Eventually, Harry ends up at Michael's country house.
Big mistake.
What follows is a slick, intense study of the male psyche filled with murderous impulses, hints of homosexualty, psychotic obsessions, stalking, bloodshed, nudity, razor-sharp dialogue and a surprise ending guaranteed to knock your socks off.
And all because Harry decides the time has come to free Michael from domestic shackles which include a nagging wife, two screaming kids, a deceitful brother and two meddlesome parents.
On the big screen, ""With a Friend Like Harry"" sizzled. On DVD, the result is the same. The only difference: You can hit the reply button every now and then, particularly when you think ""Wait a minute! Did what just happen really happen?""",1004313600,,1003,5.159509202453988
1637789,4,B00005NTN4,"Harry. What a guy that Harry is. And eggs. I want an egg right now.
But yes, the movie. Nicely done little french movie. Everyone seems to be descrbing it as a HITCHCOCKish film, and I guess they're not all wrong. It's a well paced little thriller with a vein of black comedy. Like Hitch.
And as a friend told me to watch for, tension was used very well in this movie. From the opening scene in the car with the kids going nuts, to the scene in the bathroom when we first meet Harry, the tension created is just a joy to watch. A good tone remains also throughout the entire moive.
And the end I thought was one of the best I've seen in a long time.  The implications it made marveled me. That was something I wasn't expecting. That the whole point of the movie was that Harry actually HELPS Michel was, I thought, just great. And to end the movie just how it started, in the car, on the road, but the POLAR opposite; ....
The only bad thing about this is that it's a little slow and twenty minutes or so before the very end, are a little extraneous I think. But still, definitely check it out.",994982400,6,1094,4.160377358490566
1637790,4,B00005NTN4,"Quel film!
This film is full of social commentary (as another reviewer failed to realize). Everything these days is, ""follow your dreams,"" or, ""go where your heart takes you."" This film shows what happens when one actually does those things. Sure it's a movie (things typically used for entertainment), but it's making a much larger point, which is this: maybe it is better to be tied down, but to have reason and compassion, than to be completely free yet so caught up in that freedom that you become completely irrational.
Though the film tackles an important and relevant issue, as we all must balance responsibility and freedom in our lives, it does so in a way that isn't too heavy. All of the meaning is woven masterfully into a beautiful piece of cinema. I would certainly recommend this film to everyone.",994723200,,812,4.76595744680851
1637791,1,B00005NTN4,"After listening to an interview with the director on National Public Radio, I could not wait to see this movie. The film had apparently taken home much of the hardware awarded at the ""French Oscars"" last year, and Mr. Moll described his film as being equal parts thriller, black comedy, and social commentary. I understood that the movie was French, but figured this wouldn't be a problem since Mr. Moll quite readily admits that he was born in Germany, which certainly cannot be blamed for France's precipitous decline in cultural taste; it's been over fifty years since Germany has occupied France, but I digress.
I usually consider any film of french origin somewhat suspect due in no small part to the country's fascination with Jerry Lewis. But the interview with Mr. Moll had truly swayed me, so I collected up my two grown sons and my wife and made the fifty-mile trek to the art house movie theater that was showing the film.
Right away, let me just say that ""With a Friend Like Harry"" is an absolute piece of rubbish. There wasn't enough plot in this film from which to build a substandard episode of NYPD Blue, an American TV series I've stopped watching because even the best episodes aren't all that great. Let me assure the reader that I've seen foreign movies, I like foreign movies, foreign movies are friends of mine ... For example, I loved Belle Epoque (Spanish), All About My Mother (again, Spanish) Il Postino, and Mediterraneo (both Italian), etc.
With a Friend Like Harry doesn't make you laugh. It isn't a black comedy. Nothing funny happens, and the stabs at humor fall flat. (By the way, my use of the word stabs here is a comical reference to the plot of the movie. French moviemakers take note ...)
It certainly isn't a thriller. We know very early on what Harry is up to, and the movie is just a long, slow predictable road of discovery for the husband. Unfortunately, we the viewers have paid to watch it, which hardly seems fair, in retrospect.
I guess that only leaves social commentary. Uh, ""some peoples' morals are different than others?"" Is that the social commentary? I don't think so. And the movie certainly doesn't even pretend to say anything else. So it fails as social commentary as well.
Now here's the weird part. At the end, they tie up everything with a nice bow and the husband and his immediate family escape unscathed, while the husband's murder of Harry is successfully covered up. So essentially, we have a bad french movie that reaches out at the end and finds the ""Hollywood Ending"" that so many European filmmakers (and fans) are so eager to disdain. What's the deal with that?
So there you have it. Every single member of my family hated this film. I'm in the doghouse now. It took me years of work to get my family to stop ridiculing me for making them watch the Michael Palin film, ""A Private Function."" Now all that work has been erased by this French piece of trash. Oh the horror!
My review is clearly very much at odds with most of the reviews of this film. This is because I am a fan of good films; not just a fan of foreign films. I don't give films extra credit for simply being made outside of Hollywood. That would be wrong.
I suggest that you wait until this film appears on the Sundance Channel or IFC, or at best until you can rent it for a couple of bucks. Watch it. You'll thank me for the money you saved.
Cheers!",994377600,9,3385,4.532679738562091
