2934207,5,B000VA3J5C,"For years we only had access to a few VHS recordings of Steptoe and Son.  I was very happy to see this was available - some are in black and white, all are a lot of fun.  This complete collection of BBC recordings and copies from other sources is the most complete available for the series.  Sadly the BBC didn't see a future in reruns and taped over many of the earlier shows, but thankfully others using their own equipment preserved many episodes never before available.",1363824000,2,473,4.476744186046512

8217664,5,B000VA3J5C,"I've always been a fan of Sandford and son, so I was curious to see where it came from. I believe I prefer Steptoe and son. I have both series and it's interesting to watch the first few seasons of both because they shared some of the same scripts from Steptoe. One of the best British sitcoms ever.",1443484800,,299,4.172413793103448
