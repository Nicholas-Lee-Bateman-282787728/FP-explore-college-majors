Funny doco-comedy of rather dramatic life of aging porno-star still able and keen to entertain is of a general interest.",1274918400,3,270,5.75
7977160,3,B00007K06W,"This documentary doesn't shine too flattering a light on Ron Jeremy. He is a man mocked by his peers in the adult industry for being too fat, too hairy, too cheap, too tired and too much of a clown to ever be taken seriously. The question being  posed is: Is it worth it sleeping with thousands of beautiful women if you're constantly being looked down on? Either way you view the film, as comedy or depressing tragedy, it's entertaining stuff. Ron is a colorful character who has plenty of juicy stories to tell. The only problem is that he's too busy self promoting and name dropping to make it through a full one. Luckily the other commentators, including Sharon Mitchell, Larry Flynt, Al Goldstein and Jenna Jameson, are a little more on point and just as colorful. We find out that Ron dreams of making a name for himself in mainstream films and eventually leaving porn behind. He hopes to be taken seriously as an actor and the film features a couple of mainstream directors he's worked with speculating on whether that's likely to happen. It's kind of compelling stuff even if you find porn or Ron disgusting. It might even make you change your opinion of the Hedgehog. The DVD features seven deleted scenes and a commentary track with Ron and director Scott J. Gill. Any goodwill Jeremy may have earned vanishes here as he spends the entire track whining about the lack of clips from his mainstream work, the lack of interviews with more well known porn stars, and the lack of info about his mother's involvement in the war. It's obvious that Gill is extremely annoyed by Ron and you start to wonder why he even made the film. If you can get past Ron's larger than life personality and attributes you might find a little room for enjoyment.",1249516800,5,1748,4.602564102564102
7977161,3,B00007K06W,"Boy, I was excited when I found out this ""movie"" was going to be made. There it was, the news they were making a movie about the life of Ron Jeremy.... only problem is, when I finally got to see this recently, I found out it's not a  movie at all. It's just an hour and a half doccumentary.
None of what was shown really surprised me, and I didn't really learn anything by watching it. nevertheless, it's an interesting docco to watch once because it's about Ron jeremy... the world's most recognised male porn star, who by every expectation has no place in the business. He's fat, hairly and not particularly good looking.
Of course, that's what makes him so recognisable =)
Good docco, but it's only one to watch once.",1041984000,10,720,4.454545454545454
7977162,4,B00007K06W,"Ron Jeremy. You've got to wonder about the guy. Anyone who has had the misfortune to rent a porno and then you see this hairy fat guy getting  get down and dirty with loads of beautiful women, it makes the average guy (!!ME!!) think ""If only my Old Fella were as big as Ron's"". No doubt about it, on the surface the Hedgehog looks like he is the luckiest man on God's green Earth.
PORN STAR is actually a highly enjoyable, light hearted look at the rise and rise of arguably the most successful male adult film star in history. Really, viewers will be amazed to learn that Ron really just wants to be taken seriously as an actor and most of the time according to SCREW editor Al Goldstein, he would rather eat copious amounts of food than what he is famed for (ahem!) eating. Hard to believe.
Unlike WADD: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JOHN C HOLMES and SEX: THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY, PORN STAR features no sordid tales of drug abuse or degradation at the hands of sleazy porn merchants. It's basically the tale of a regular all round nice guy blessed with a mega sized schlong who gets to live out every guy's wildest fantasies, yet still finds time to do excruciatingly unfunny standup comedy routines and used to be a high school teacher!! Actually he only intended to do a handful (huh huh) of pornos until more meaty roles came along (huh huh again). PORN STAR is a must see for anyone who is even mildly interested in porn. Highly recommended",1040688000,50,1439,4.409774436090226
