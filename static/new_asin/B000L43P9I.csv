8160103,4,B000L43P9I,"This is a pretty good set to own.  The first movie is great, the second okay and I the third I didn't like.  By the third movie they started to get really silly and slap stick.  More of a spoof of the old jewel theft movies.  The picture and sound are okay and all movies are all in widescreen.  A good set for Chiba fans but it's not for everyone.",1185408000,,348,3.914285714285714
