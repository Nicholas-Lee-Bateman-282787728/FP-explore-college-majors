8162073,4,B000LLIW0S,"I didn't know what to expect with this video. Yogi B, leads a yoga class with his students. The details are already well reported by the other reviewer so I won't go into them. I learned a lot. Yogi B does bark a lot and is kind of insulting to his students. I got the video to see him in action. Since he is no longer alive, I just wondered what he was like. I really love K yoga and feel it's very effective. He is a motivator, it's not sissy yoga. I actually found myself kinda liking that. If you are looking for Kundalini yoga tapes a little more accessible, I love Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's DVD's.",1324857600,3,604,4.084033613445378
8162074,4,B000LLIW0S,"This is a live class taped in the late 1980's with Yogi B and his students.  It begins with a lecture.  There is no warm up.  He goes right into the set.  The set is pretending you are snoring, breath of fire in stretch pose, pounding the floor with your hands, bowing in celebate pose, sat kriya and celestial communication (arm movements to mantra music).  He then plays the gong for meditation, says a few words and its over.  You will probably need to add the tuning in and final blessing yourself.  Yogi B is an interesting person to watch.  He was very hard on his students almost tyrannical.  However this is a good set for anger issues.  Keep in mind that if you have neighbors below you, they may not like the pounding on the floor. BTW this dvd is available other places, cheaper.",1182211200,11,790,4.386206896551724
