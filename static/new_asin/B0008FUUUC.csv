Protools is well known as the industry standard for recording music. Ken is an incredibly articulate, incredibly personable guy.
He was known at Protool (Digidesign) at the best Tech Support Guy. He was so good at helping clients with their tech issues, The company (Digidesign) gave him a special position and would fly him around the world to ""special customers"" like Neil Young, Peter Gabriel and Prince, to help them personally with their Protools studio issues. Digidesign gave Ken permission to put his unique ability to explain Protools to the layman, on a DVD, and this is his Third edition of this successful series. Most important for the buyer of this DVD, is knowing that Ken is a good guy. an Honest straightforward but casual Honest guy...RARE IN Business, especially the music business.  This is the best way to learn protools systems....This DVD is in essence, a guy who really knows his stuff, sitting down and chatting with you about what ever you need to know about Protools..in a way that is easy to take in.",1445990400,,1161,4.8
8056041,4,B0008FUUUC,"Loving my basic information about recording and mixing DVD. It truly is the DVD to have when learning about audio engineering. I do feel, however, there could've been a bit more explination in some chapters though!",1406505600,,214,4.972222222222222
8056042,1,B0008FUUUC,Got 2 copies of DVD and neither would play. Returned both to Amazon. Product should be pulled off the list.,1395964800,,107,4.4
8056043,4,B0008FUUUC,"I received it today and have already watched the DVD. I am happy with the content, however I wish more information or time was spent on the individual instruments (guitar, bass, drums, vocals) mixing sections.  This is a great video if you are new to home recording. If you are an experienced home recording hobbyist, you will learn at least a few things. I have been a home recording hobbyist for several years and I learned several things from this video. I am hoping they offer additional videos which go more indepth of mixing and mastering.  I felt the video was well worth the price.",1355875200,2,589,4.6
8056044,4,B0008FUUUC,This product has been quite invaluable in getting me much farther up the learning curve regarding recording and mixing. Everything sounds better and I now have much more professional level methods and techniques including the ability to hear the mix with a better understanding  that really help me to get the sound I have been after for a long time. Kudos to the producers of this product. I wish I had found it years ago. Highly recommended to anyone needing a good basic understanding of this process.,1311120000,2,504,4.793103448275862
8056045,5,B0008FUUUC,"My copy is fully compatible with DVD players in the US. Sorry to hear about the previous reviewers bad experience with that.
-the DVD was made in 2004 so some of the exact pro-tools functions look different on the screen. But the concepts are rock solid and up to date. I found it to be very helpful, I'm an intermediately experienced home recording engineer/producer.",1294617600,2,368,4.765625
8056046,1,B0008FUUUC,"I purchased this for my husband to use to learn more about digital recording and mixing.  I did not know until after he tried to play it that it requires a PC and Quicktime.  My husband is not computer savvy and even though I installed Quicktime on my computer we had issues with the video freezing, etc. even though I am computer savvy.  He is frustrated that he cannot use it without a computer.  Wish I'd known that before purchasing as this will just collect dust.",1278201600,3,468,4.406976744186046
