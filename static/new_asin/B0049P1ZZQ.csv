4290569,5,B0049P1ZZQ,If you happened to have read the comics or just like the zombie horror genre then this is a great thing for you. The Walking Dead manages to take a fresh approach in a genre that has been done and done again. Its still just the first episode and the show has moments where its still trying to find its feet but the shots are impressive and it has a pretty decent story which is something severely lacking from a lot of modern horror. It uses the comics for guidance but doesn't patronize the material. Well done premiere.,1288569600,,521,4.326530612244898

4290592,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"Started good, turned to sh*t after the 2nd season. Typically predictable, and stereotypical characters that build a bunch of garbage can characters that just contribute to the current racist diatribe that the Hollywood PEDOPHILE elite keep pushing on the world to keep society apart from each other and keep the world fighting.
I choose to live in a society that is free from all the discrimination that Hollywood keeps promoting. We have to vote with our dollars to show that we will not support the Deepstate Hollywood agenda...",1519430400,,530,5.034090909090909

4290600,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This will be a short review, as I've already made an 11-12 minute long video review for this. (In case you don't want to watch that!) Very good special edition! The packaging is nice, the pictures inside and out are great, the behind the scenes are fantastic, and the commentaries are maybe my favorite part! (Everything is so good though, that it's mostly all tied!) I can't believe that the regular Blu-ray, and DVD, don't have commentaries, or this one specific behind the scenes thing, because they're really good, and seem like something that should have been included in the regular purchase! Not that they're not special, they just seem like what you usually normally get with other Blu-ray and DVD purchases!

I'm really not trying to shout myself out here, but I just know that I made a video that went way more in depth, and wanted to make sure that you could find it, and see it, if you wanted to! I'll maybe write a review above all of this, if I can't directly link to the video on here! Update, I can't directly link to it, so I'll just tell you that it's on the channel ""dewlover420 weekly."" (Not ""dewlover420."" That's where I post every day. ""dewlover420 weekly"" is for movie and TV stuff, mostly reviews of them!) You can just search YouTube, and you'll find it!",1516752000,,1279,4.560869565217391

4290604,1,B0049P1ZZQ,The first season is skipping and pixelated?,1514160000,,43,5.285714285714286
4290605,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The First Season is all around amazing.  We find ourselves thrown into the world of some very strong characters and great writing.  In this short and absolutely awesome season you will probably find yourself attached to over half a dozen characters.  The interactions between our players comes off as real and it doesn't take much to become invested in them.'

The effects are great.  A lot of attention and detail went into the zombies (walkers), and things didn't come across as over-done.  It looks like real make-up and prosthetics were used and there isn't a lot of crappy CGI to pull you out of the zone.  The music, when used, is good, but there are a lot of silent parts too in which you get a sense of what the atmosphere would really be like.  Sometimes less is more and this show made good use of that.  They didn't take the shaky-camera cop-out, they also didn't exaggerate things to the point it looked unbelievable.  They kept it honest - as if they sat around and thought - ""what would this actually look like"" and then showed it to us as realistically as they could!  I was able to suspend my disbelief and get lost in the story!

Another thing I appreciate is that in this season they did not go out of their way to try to make ruthlessly pick on religion.  A certain survivor and his son say a prayer over their meal after rescuing a stranger - its fast, short, and too the point.  That was appreciated - that a family that just so happened to believe in God was able to keep to their faith and it was no big deal.  It wasn't done from a standpoint to try to prosyletize, it was simple just in the show because that was that family's beliefs.  Too many new shows I watch go out of their way to make cartoonishly awful religious characters when its CLEAR it had nothing to do with the story line and was just some crack-pot writer standing on a soap box who wanted to throw his or her opinion in your face - so really - it was really refreshing to watch something that was simply about what it claims to be about - the Walking Dead, and how a group of very like-able characters come together to manage in the face of that.",1514160000,,2139,4.31

4290647,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The series is good, and would be better if made by HBO or another premium channel.  AMC productions are made to fit into a primetime slot that includes lots of time for commercials, and the story suffers.  Also, AMC can't seem to cast decent actors.  Some of the characters aren't interesting because of the untalented actors playing the parts.  The character ""Andrea"" is played by that homely, frog-faced Laurie Holden who can't act well enough to play herself in her own life story, let alone portray a character in a drama.  The 1st season had me hoping to see her become dinner for zombies ASAP just so I don't have to see her ruin more scenes.

  The main character, Rick is played by Andrew Lincoln who really isn't up to the task.  When he has to talk seriously at another character he does this little one step dance like Dustin Hoffman's ""Rainman"" character.  It's comical, but a little annoying.  Some of the better performances are turned in by minor characters like Lennie James as Morgan.  James is a very good actor who I hope will get a boost to his career from this series.",1500422400,2,1089,4.556701030927835

4290678,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"In my search for more action/adventure in my tv viewing, I stumbled across this series on Netflix. I'm not a big fan of the zombie genre, but was willing to give it a try. The start was very promising, with good characters and action sequences. But as I progressed through the seasons, I became disenchanted with the writing. The characters began waffling to fit into the writers' intended outcome. I began shouting at my tv in frustration when characters on the edge of disaster suddenly turned into complete idiots just so some plot complication could happen. The final straw was when the (apparently) long-awaited introduction of the super badass villain occurred. Yes, this show may be based on a comic book series, but the writers didn't have to bow down in homage to those roots. The villain's speech was so long-winded and overblown, I was reminded of Vogon poetry (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) where to hear it was to be driven mad. I never made it to the end of the speech, nor have I watched since. The writing is just too deplorable to hold my interest.",1489881600,,1069,4.691489361702128

Ran across a TWD marathon on AMC and was intrigued about this guy who wakes up in a hospital with no people there, no power, and no idea of what has happened.  Then I saw the zombie in the park and changed the channel.  But that guy, he intrigued me, so I bought the season.  I ended up binge watching it and ordering the next season, and the next, and the next.... I like how the zombies are not the focus of the show, but rather how these survivors are trying to safely create a life for themselves on a time and place where what is normal is so vastly different from what was normal.

Season 1 is only 6 episodes, so no way was I going to pay more than 10 dollars for it. TWD is still one of my favorites. I would categorize this as a drama with horror elements- it has zombies and gore, but it's really about the characters and their stories- that's what sets it apart. Like most long running shows, it has lost a little of its sparkle 7 seasons in, but it remains entertaining and one of the best TV has to offer.",1481414400,,566,4.108108108108108

4290766,2,B0049P1ZZQ,Got to say at the time I was a big fan of the graphic novels and really liked a lot of work Frank Darabont had done so initially I was very excited for this. Unfortunately this has got to be the most overrated dreck for any horror fan out there. It doesn't have the same engaging social commentary of any of the Romero films although the creators of the graphic novels clearly state they were influenced by it. I think Andrew Lincoln is horribly miscast as Rick Grimes and the overall pacing is just all over the place. I gave it to about season 4 and it did not get any better.,1479513600,,578,4.169642857142857

That's what the Walking Dead is about. How do we get along with others, how far should we go to protect ourselves and loved ones? How much liberty do we sacrifice for security? The shady business of morality.

I can watch season 1 over and over again. It's kind of gritty, low budget looking at times but in a realistic sense that sets it apart from most of the garbage you see on TV. The actors play the roles well and they really draw you in to caring about them. Amazing show that I've had to stop watching at times simply because I've been drawn in too deep. I always come back though, again and again.

There's also the zombie stuff too, if you're into that, top notch.",1475884800,,720,4.240875912408759

I'm not sure why I have those before Season 1 and 2. But at any rate, my DVD's of Season 1 arrived in excellent shape.
There are Bonus Features: Making of The Walking Dead, Inside The Walking Dead; Episodes 1-6, Behind the scenes.
Another DVD features Extra Footage: Zombie School, Bicycle Girl, etc...
I can't wait till the new Seasons come on and then I am on pins and needles the whole time the show is on. My husband and friends know when The Walking Dead is on - leave me alone!

There is an actual plot more than just killing of zombies or being killed by zombies. you become very attached to all of the characters and the writers do an amazing job of character building. They will have you hating a character you loved or loving a character you hated in the matter of just a few episodes and they do it so carefully!,1473984000,,408,4.177215189873418
4290820,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Is there really a need to review this? If you're a fan, you're a fan. If you're not, what are you waiting for?
It's absolutely worth owning this series. With repeated (non commercial) watchings, a new layer is peeled back exposing character traits, motivations, and personalities that you missed in prior viewings. That's the mark of great writing. I just never get tired of watching these characters develop.

I might add it's much less stressful when you already know what's going to happen. There's tension and excitement- sure- but at least you're not clenching your teeth hoping your favorites don't die.

If this is your first go-round with TWD, go ahead and order S2 now. S1 was a trial and was a very short season- guaranteed you'll finish it in one or two days and be jonesing for S2 so go ahead and have it ready to go.",1473638400,,829,4.594594594594595

In other words, they're okay, but nothing to write home about.  This series is about FAR more than the zombies, it's a show about the people and how they deal with this crazy new world they fight every moment to survive in.  Off the hook great.

4290870,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love this series.  I didn't think I would because zombies are just ridiculous.  How can you believe in zombies. But they turned it into a riveting story.  They even provide an explanation of how the brain stops functioning and how a person becomes a ""walker""...(Democrat).  It's also fun because when watching it, you can tell the walkers are the Democrats.  Absolutely now brains, no thought process, and only one thing on their minds.  They just keep coming at you and try to take everything you have, biting and biting into you until there is nothing left.  They even look like Democrats and act like Democrats.  Since they saw fit to take a shot at Republicans when the evil brother accused the good brother of being a Republican because he cared about people, I feel it's fair to take this shot at Democrats.  I'm sick and tired of watching shows and all of a sudden out of the blue, they take a shot at  Republicans.  EVERY show does it, now,  Just to set the record straight, Conservatives, (not the RINO's), believe in helping people, being tolerant, world peace, etc.  And the way to achieve all of this is the opposite of what the Democrats (socialists and communists) do.  Capitalism is what made this country great.  The Constitution has been shredded by the current crowd in Washington, and we are in jeopardy of losing our freedoms.  A great show like this wouldn't have a chance in a socialist or communist society.  Capitalism is what makes it work.  If the shows producers or writers think differently, they should donate all their (spit out this next word like its evil) PROFITS to the poor.  You control the airwaves now.

Once I started I got so hooked up that I watched all six seasons one after the other, a total of 88 episodes.  Now that I finished I can't wait for season seven to start in October.

Did a bit of research and found I could watch Season 1 through 5 for free on Netflix (sadly, I didn't research until after I paid for Season 1).  Soooo only two stars for pricing but five stars for the show.  Now, if only I could find Season 6 for free. :-)",1463443200,,364,4.231884057971015

Im sure the show gets better but Im already on the fifth episode and am ready to quit. The southern accents don't help. I just finished watching Breaking Bad and am probably very spoiled. Its really too bad because I'm a zombie fan from way back and this show does a great job with them. I don't think its entirely the actors fault, the scripts, direction and pacing are terrible. Maybe I should just skip ahead to the 2nd or third season.",1462060800,,575,4.433962264150943

When they began talking about it and watching it the way they described it made me think of night of the living dead movies I watched as a kid. They were stupid and I wasn't willing to set down and watch this series. I was in the room once while they were watching it and it caught my attention. I decided then and there I was going to watch it. We live in the woods so I cant stream videos so found it listed on Amazon and decided to purchase it. OMG.... I love it. I didn't think I would, but I do. It draws you in and keeps you waiting in suspense on what will happen next. There is never a dull moment in this series. Once I started watching I couldn't stop.

I struggled through the first episodes, but I have to say, I ended up getting hooked. I've bought the dvd's since to keep up with it. As a series it is brutal, ugly and disgusting.

Now, if you, or a friend, are not a fan of the zombie genre, I HIGHLY recommend you give this series a shot, starting at Season 1. It is chalk-full of humanity, infused into a genre that is typically devoid of such. The characters evolve, dramatically, from season-to-season to deal and cope with the utter breakdown of civilization.

If you are a Zombie enthusiast, then you've already seen this show. The one thing I will say is don't listen to your enthusiast friends that say the show is too slow. It's a different take on the genre that balances character dev., but includes those classic elements of zombie vs. human.",1454889600,,681,4.762711864406779

4291029,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was hesitant on watching something called ""The Walking Dead"" because even though I love horror movies I've never ever liked zombie movies. My son told me I would LOVE it and since he talked me into watching a sweet series called ""Breaking Bad"" I thought maybe this kid is on to something! I still doubted I'd like it. I dragged my feet for a few weeks and then I gave in...I was desperate to purge on yet another series, so I thought I'd give it a shot...and again I was hooked! This is tastefully (no pun intended) done with excellent actors- excellent story behind said zombies that makes sense to me. These zombies aren't clawing out of their graves but have a virus that becomes active once they die naturally or not so natural (zombie bite, etc) and the government failed to contain it or is responsible for it in the first place. This will come into light soon after or in first season). Really really love this series, gimme more!",1454112000,,939,4.465116279069767

I PURCHASED the TWO disc Bd set of season one. My opinion is that the bluray quality lacked from one camera to the next. At times the picture was grained. At other times the picture was great. Audio seemed even and good through out. If you want the set for your collection its fine. If you want 1080p broadcast quality wait on a better release.",1449100800,2,486,4.282608695652174

4291109,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"I will never understand the draw to zombie movies and this series just confirms it.  Zombies are boring creatures created by equally unimaginative writers.  They can't do much other than shamble, moan and bite.  They can't think, plan, or use instruments. Occasionally, you get a fast mover, but that's only when the script calls for it. Such as when Glenn is making a getaway in the red Challenger.  Then, all of sudden, a walker can run and climb fences.  SMH!  In order for the zombies to have a chance to be a threat to anyone, you have to have characters with the brains of garden snails.  That's pretty much what you get with the Walking dead.  Booring!!!",1447200000,4,661,4.589743589743589

Many of my friends watched The Walking Dead when it first came on AMC and said it was great. So I got the first season when the third one was airing. Wow. The story line just kept me glued to the tv. It wasn't as bad as I thought as far as being gross or scary. I then found out it is from a comic. I have now caught up and look forward to every new episode.

This show is so well acted and written it plays unlike any horror/zombie show/flick I have ever seen.  And God bless the producers/writers for never using the word ""zombie"" in this show.  I think if any of the characters referred to the walkers as zombies it would ruin the ambiance.  Cheapen it somehow.  Make it campy.

Anyhoo,  I rather enjoyed not being acquainted with this show at all until some months after the 5th season had aired because I was able to bingewatch the whole thing over a period of a few weeks rather than 5 years of waiting, ... and waiting for a new season to begin.

4291157,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"YOU MAY WANT TO READ THIS if you're one of those that sees or hears that this series centers around ""zombies"" and your next reaction is, ""Zombies, you say? No thanks, I'll pass.""  Take a wild guess who had the same exact reaction! I'll fess up, ""comic book zombie stuff placed into a TV series, nahhhh"", was my initial reaction.

But then I started thinking, and doing some additional probing, hmmmmm, the reviews are rather good and the series has now entered its ==6th== season. I mean, hey, how bad or off the wall or dull or zombie over-kill can it be? Confession #2, some months ago I was looking at the movie ""Battleship"" and the very moment I read that the ""enemy"" was out of space ""aliens"", it was an automatic turn-off and pass. But then, at least on that one, a Blu Ray DVD of the movie had a super sale price and on a total whim I got it and I loved it! Alien ""enemies"" or not because the special effects were absolutely dazzling 'especially' in Blu Ray!

Sooooo, nosing around,  I saw that Amazon had a reduced price for ""The Walking Dead"" , first season,  and which is only =8= episodes and not 12 episodes as are all the other years but, hey, on another whim I bought it and figured if the first episode or so was not a grabber or they over-did the zombie thing, no big loss at a $19.95 sale and free shipping for the ==Blu Ray== version.

I'll cut to the chase. The characters and the writing quality become the grabbers in this series. By episode 4 and clinched with episode 5 of Season one , I ordered season 2. Then seasons 3, 4 and 5!  THIS from someone who initially heard the word ""zombies"" and wanted to pass! My next buy will be season 6! Since I use satellite dish internet [the only game in town in very rural areas], watching via downloads or in real-time on the internet bites [no pun intended] in to my monthly satellite gigabyte usage so the best option for me is to get the DVD or Blu-Ray when the series wraps and the DVD or Blue Ray becomes available. It works out because the discs have plenty of extras including deleted scenes. In any event, it's worth the watch and you ==will== get involved with the characters although [** don't worry, I won't give anything away] but, how to say it, and here I'm making reference to 5 ==seasons== of the show, there are some characters who, let us say, ""disappear"" along the way [please note again -- I'm making reference to the first =5= seasons of the show] where I get the classic ""WHY ==you-know-who== syndrome"" as was the case in the SOA [Sons of Anarchy] series! Are you with me? If you were an avid fan of SOA [now ended], you KNOW who I'm talking about and the fans were not happy campers when you-know-who was taken out via that pipe.  Script writers always contend that such-and-such ""had"" to happen to ""move the show in the right direction"" but I take issue with that! Why? When the ==fans== really like a character and perhaps can even identify with that character and he or she is taken out especially if in real life the actor or actress didn't want out [!], well, that can be a drag! Nuff' said on that.

Try out season 1 and my guess is that you'll be back for more! Zombies or no zombies!

4291210,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I always think its helpful to give a little context of the reviewer. Im in my late 20s, live and work in a city with a high stress job, and have little time to watch TV so I tend to not watch shows in real-time but wait for recommendations and then get them on Amazon. And I have seen very few zombie films/TV shows if any  It is not a genre I typically seek out. But wow  I feel head over heels for this show with Season 1 and have not been able to stop watching since.

When I first heard the premise for the show  a group of survivors fighting to stay alive after the entire world has been consumed by a disease that reanimates the dead and causes them to become vicious, blood thirsty, zombies  I thought no way would I enjoy this. But after several friends kept pushing, I finally caved and watched.

The show is of course violent and gory but all of that is really second to the characters themselves who make this show so amazing. The show makes you question values, human morals, and you find yourself rooting and cheering for these people through the screen.

Season one follows Rick Grimes as he travels to Atlanta and then the countryside to try and find his son and wife. This season is really focused on Ricks rise to group leader and the dilemmas he faces in this new world. It is definitely worth watching!!",1440547200,,1322,4.285140562248996

4291213,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"THIS EDITION IS DEFINITELY EDITED! Probably one of my favorite scenes in ""Guts"" is cut out of the episode where the group in Atlanta pulls in a walker so that Glenn and Rick can cover themselves with his dead body parts to disguise their odor to the walkers. Rick stops and acknowledges the identity and humanity of the walker and who he used to be by looking at his drivers license and having a kind a short funeral for him. It's one of my favorite scenes in the entire series because it represents a sense of humanity that quickly faded away once the show got going.

4291248,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I have watched this very first episode of The Walking Dead many times over and each time I am just as mesmerized, heartbroken and heart warmed as the first time I ever saw it. Andrew Lincoln brings such depth to the character of Rick Grimes, coping with the discovery of the world as he knew it having been destroyed, his family nowhere to be found. Lennie James as Morgan is just as compelling, introducing Rick to the violent world they now have to call home. The hope and drive in Rick's soul, to embark on a journey to find his wife & son, is incredibly palpable as we watch him, feel him yearn to be reunited with them. His performance is gripping ... and we can't wait to join him as he gears up & hits the road. Morgan's performance as Rick's rescuer, teacher & friend is amazing, you can't take your eyes away from the story for a second, it is that interesting ...  especially as we watch him going through his family photographs. The scene will break your heart.  'Days Gone Bye' is what hooked me into the series. I give it 5 golden stars.",1438128000,,1050,4.324873096446701

4291276,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Just the best, the whole show. I'm awaiting season 6 anxiously. Season one has some extremely strong episodes. This show isn't a one trick pony. It has depths that continue to amaze me, and while it's an ensemble drama, the characters are allowed, encouraged, shoved into complexity, and it seems so perfectly well done. The morally weak character develops into a better person--but slowly. The virtuous get darker. The saints....start to understand the sinners very, very well. So to speak.

If you like a zompoc with a clearly defined cause, Walking Dead doesn't have one. Neither does the graphic novel. We do know it's very likely viral. It seemed to overcome the populace rapidly. The zombies are indeed reanimated dead. They are similar to Romero-type shamblers, although they do move faster when prey is sighted.

In general, as the seasons go by, there's an alternation between what's the bigger danger...humans or the walkers. The word zombie is never used btw. Could go on and on. Watch the first episode. Some episodes are draggy, and that holds true throughout all 5 seasons. There are ""setting and establishing"" episodes that always, always have huge, so-satisfying payoff episodes down the road.",1435968000,,1209,5.101010101010101

I think it's a great set for a reasonable price however I now am a Netflix subscriber & Netflix has the first 4 seasons. My advice is to buy Netflix so you can watch all 5 seasons for less than $12 a month along with a ton of other shows & movies.

I would downgrade it for some highly improbable situations as well as for lack of a convincing presence of faith. It is not realistic to show any random group of Southerners who are not both Protestant and most probably devout--particularly in difficult circumstances like this. There wouldn't be many Catholics, so that's probably realistic enough. Someone told us that religion is addressed in later seasons. We are going to keep watching, of course! It's interesting for looking at how people are likely to react when they're under serious pressure to survive and also for getting ideas on survival in emergencies.",1433721600,,738,4.818897637795276

If you've never watched The Walking Dead or you are an avid watcher, theses are great to add to your DVD collection.  I have already purchased Seasons 2-4.

4291384,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"Despite being exceptionally, even excessively, gory, there is enough character development and an interesting enough plot to keep me watching.  Not for anyone with a weak stomach, but if you can get past the blood and violence, you might enjoy it.  I'm talking about people painting themselves with blood and tissue from a dead person and walking around with that person's intestines around their necks--really, really nasty stuff.  And not just violence to people--animals too.  Not sure if I will buy any more seasons of this.  I believe it could have been done with less focus on the blood and guts scenes.  Kind of puts me in mind of The Stand, but Stephen King, who is not exactly a shrinking violet when it comes to horror, told that story without resorting to so much graphic violence.",1428364800,2,792,4.786764705882353

4291393,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I know I'm so late to this show but I really enjoyed Season 1. What I think I like most is they don't drag out the storyline. Things that you are waiting for happen quickly.

4291399,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Started to watch in the 3rd season. Missed the beginning episodes, and always wondered how it all began. It still doesn't go into depth about how the walkers came to be, i.e., a virus or what. But, it was great to finally view the first of the series.",1427587200,,251,4.25
4291400,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The zombie as reimagined by George Romero in 1967 was a remarkably potent monster that seemed to reach the deepest levels of primal fear. Yet it was a remarkably limited monster. It wasn't intelligent and even romantic like a vampire or even a werewolf when not transformed; not coldly intelligent like an evil space alien, or able to crush cities like Godzilla. Within the short time span of a movie, everything that could be done with them was essentially done in the original Night of the Living Dead. You might change the location to a shopping mall or whatever, but the setup was always the same: a group of people were trapped somewhere and the zombies were trying, always relentlessly, to get at them. It didn't help that the numerous films that followed usually had miniscule budgets, poor writing and minimally talented actors.

Then The Walking Dead showed the way. With a TV series there was time to do more than be trapped in some building. You could develop characters, move around, show interaction between groups of survivors, open the whole thing up, and this is what the Walking Dead staff and actors have done with great success. It's still a bit limited. You can go into the primary group's relationships and dynamics and this can develop characters, but too much of this and it can turn into a soap opera of who's in love with who or whatever and lose its way. Or, you can introduce the possibilities of conflict with other groups or villainous leaders of groups which creates opportunities for action beyond zombie killing. A few people have complained that it is getting somewhat repetitious by the end of season five, but it is still a somewhat limited template. I don't think those fans would want a full season of peace and happiness which is about the only alternative.

The Walking Dead has tried both directions with maybe a bit too much soap opera in the first half of season two and maybe too long of a single villain arc in season three, but each time has pulled back and brought the show back on track. Mostly it explores human nature when the protected life we knew that allowed us to be ultra-nice people disappears and the world becomes a hostile and dangerous place where niceness doesn't suffice any more and we have to bring out the tougher, harsher side of ourselves.,

The show does this wonderfully well and this is where you start. Be forewarned that the show can be pretty ruthless about killing off major characters. But if the primary characters were always safe like in older TV fare, it wouldn't be very unsettling and would become a bore. Like any of the better series coming out of cable these days it can be addicting. ENJOY!",1427500800,6,2675,4.67515923566879

Vanity Fair says ""The Walking Dead is the best new television show of the year"". AGREED. DreadCentral says this is ""The greatest zombie epic of the last three decades"". After waking up out of a coma, a police man finds that he is in a nightmare world. Atlanta, Georgia is deserted and he finds that zombies have taken it over! He soon finds some human survivors in a camp outside of town that are barely surviving the zombie apocalypse. This is a story of human survival against cataclysmic odds. This TV show airs Sunday nights on AMC network and is directed and made by the same people who made The Shawshank Redemption, The Terminator, and Aliens. It is based on the comic book/magazine of the same name. VERY, VERY GRAPHIC. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. I would rate this TV show R or MA for violence, gore, blood, occasional cussing, occasional nudity, and intense action.",1425427200,9,989,4.469613259668508

4291446,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This series is one I thought I could avoid.  I mean, seriously, how many more zombie flicks do we need? I'm a big fan of George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" movie circa 1968.  We all grew up with it right? That was a really scary movie shown on late Saturday night TV.  Everyone loved it, or at least those of us who liked a good scare and also enjoyed monster movies growing up and staying up past our bedtimes.

But then came all of the zombie sequels and rip offs to no end. I hated all the sequels like ""Dawn of the Dead"" etc. I know their are big fans of that movie in the shopping mall, but to me, it did not have the scary effect and only the gory part...in color. Trust me when I say I like horror movies, but only the original stood out for me and I'm not even sure ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the original zombie movie. In fact, something in my memory makes me think it is not.  But it did have the most impact in the late sixties and us young kids in the early 70's. I also liked Romero's 1990 remake in color.

Now onto this series.  I avoided it like the plague for the last number of years thinking it was either just another rip off or simply trying to impress people with more gore and/or CGI effects.  Well, I was bored and decided to at least give Season One a shot. I'm glad I did. This is ""Night of the Living Dead"" modernized for today's audiences. It's really not about the zombies but the adventure for survival for the living, which holds true to Romero's original.  I looked forward to viewing the future episodes.",1425081600,,1551,4.1433333333333335

4291526,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is one of those TV series that you don't think you're going to like and then find out it's INCREDIBLE.  I actually had the 1st season sitting around for almost an entire year, lent to me by my father, before I ever watched it. Looking at the description on the  back I was like ""Ehh...an apocalypse with zombies...yeah right. Whatever.""  Just lots of blood and gore, right? WRONG.  While there is surely plenty of that in WD, the real focus and charm of this show lies in its characters.  There's so much character development, in fact, that you truly fall in love with them (or hate them with every bone in your body) and it makes you truly care about these people and what they are facing in such a dark, scary world.  Gone is the day-to-day life of work, sitting at home watching TV, or even going on vacation.  This is now a world filled with danger, from the undead to the living alike, and NOTHING is the same.  Survival...and nothing but survival, that is the name of the game.  I have watched all 4 released seasons and will very much look forward to season 5's release...but the 1st was a brilliant start and full of gripping action. **SPOILER ALERT**- My heart nearly leapt out of my chest, for instance, the first time Rick got trapped by zombies in the city, his horse got eaten alive, and he barely made it into the tank before the same would have happened to him.  After that scene that was it...I was hooked.",1421798400,,1440,4.420454545454546

4291557,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I've only recently begun watching The Walking Dead, being one of the few people in America who didn't get swept up in it by the third or fourth season.  On TV, it isn't easy to jump into unless they play a marathon starting at the beginning, and even then, you're going to be on the couch for way too many hours, or you're going to be taking up a ton of room on your TV saving them all.  I'm not much into streaming video, so thank goodness for DVD's.

After finally getting Season 1, I can understand why the show has become such a phenomenon.  It all starts with the direction of Frank Darabont, the man behind Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist, and The Shield.  I've noticed some stylistic similarities to The Mist, which presented an equally apocalyptic atmosphere.  Aside from his effectiveness stylistically, Darabont achieves a tremendous degree of realism in his work, which made Shawshank Redemption such an amazing achievement.  Making the zombie apocalypse seem real is no easy task, but Darabont pulls it off as well as anyone who has worked in the genre.

One of the features making the show so believable is the outstanding acting, some by veterans of Darabont's past work.  Laurie Holden, who starred in The Mist, earned a well-deserved Emmy nomination for Walking Dead.  Jeffrey DeMunn is also great, and has been in Darabont's biggest movies.  Michael Rooker, who has a long film career, is another highlight.  And, of course, Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes is as strong as acting gets on most TV shows.  The rest of the cast keeps up with the heavy hitters, though, to round out one of the best ensemble casts on TV.

There's really not much to dislike about The Walking Dead, unless you're opposed to the violence and gore.  But since any fan of the zombie genre won't be opposed to those elements, that shouldn't be much of a concern.  If you're not into violence and gore, why are you watching a zombie show, anyway?  The only criticism I've really seen for this show is that, for a story based on a comic book zombie apocalypse, it takes itself very seriously, maintaining a grim, oppressive tone that can be a bit much at times.  I can understand that notion, but the show has a strong enough cast and crew to pull off being mostly serious.  Naturally, I'll be continuing my exploration into the series now that I've finished Season 1, and I'm sure from all the accolades I've heard that there's some great stuff to come.",1420243200,,2456,4.630484988452656

I got seasons 1 - 3 for $35 on Blu-ray during the holiday sales for my parents. They LOVE the Walking Dead (don't we all?), and they were super happy with the gift- even more so when they noticed it wasn't just DVD. They call me a few times a week to thank me, and they watch 3 - 5 episodes a night.

4291568,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"I purchased this series (Seasons 1-4) for my husband for Christmas. So far, we're half-way through Season 2 and almost every episode has scenes missing. The biggest part that we noticed was missing in Season 1 is when they arrive at the CDC. On the original series (and on Netflix) they are shown making their way from their vehicles to the CDC building, knocking and pounding on the door, then begging into the camera to the man inside. On this disc version it cuts all of that out and jumps straight to the guy letting them in. LAME!

Other reviewers indicate that there are parts cut out of only the international version and only for gore-purposes. WRONG. I purchased the US version and the scenes cut out aren't necessarily bloody or violent.",1420070400,4,747,4.659090909090909

This does not even have MENU option, does not have option to switch from widescreen to full tv option. I have old TV, and this movie is meant to be for widescreen so the picture looks funny and stretched a little. And it does not give Closed Caption option.

Update, we now got rid of OLD TV and got flatscreen widescreen TV and smart bluray player and then DVD Menu option shows up, now I can finally watch it with subtitles for hard of hearing. I guess this DVD doesn't work with old dvd player or old Tv..",1419465600,2,610,4.205128205128205

4291628,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"Would have been one start had there not been character development and interaction amongst survivors.  Yet, I despise the main premise.  A contagious disease takes over the earth.  People get infected by getting bitten by a victim of this disease, a zombie.  Once beaten their brain shuts down and they die, only to wake up to be a member of zombie species.  The ending of 1st season finally explained why the world was being run by zombies whose brains are reduced to reptilian brains, that is they can only function enough to survive, they only survive by eating up the remaining few members of human species, who if not totally consumed wake up to be zombies themselves.  The whole set showed lots of blood n guts, and painted zombie species not as living beings, but as monsters.  The way they were killed by few members of surviving humans, made me question who were the monsters, who were the humans.  Obviously having a fully functional human brain did not turn humans into fully human.  Both species that were pitted against each other were only doing the same, trying to survive.  At least main Rick character had seen one of the zombies with both her legs, most of her body eaten up as an innocent victim, n apologized from her as he relieved her suffering by killing her. Yet I did  not see that touch of humanity, that is compassionate outlook to the nightmare again the whole season.  What a grim outlook to future!.  Mankind is liable to turn into monsters, when their survival is at stake.  Yes, they can form communities to help each other survive, they can use science to increase their likelihood of survival.  Yet they see themselves as justified to annihilate all other life forms they deem as threatening to their existence.  Yes that had been man kind's history.  This show makes it their future as well.
Another objection to this show is how it desensitize the viewers to scenes of cruelty, violence, or suffering.  Such creativity in scripting and filming should have been used to create a futuristic world where compassion n justice for all life forms  rule.",1418083200,,2083,4.7202216066482

4291658,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"It took me 3 years to make myself watch the first episode of The Walking Dead (TWD).  I am not big on the horror genre; however, when I saw the first season, I then immediately binge-watched the next two seasons to get ready for Season 4 on AMC.  I am now a HUGE Fan of TWD.  Sure it has zombies in the show, which represent a constant threat in a post apocalyptic Atlanta, GA, but it is mainly a show about people.  Although based upon a graphic novel series under the same title, the show realistically portrays what society could become in a ""Zombie Apocalypse.""

In so many scenarios, People are more dangerous than the Zombies when it comes to lawless, unstructured survival.  I found myself asking the question over and over - 'What would I do in that same situation?'  The show mainly follows a group of extremely eclectic and diverse individuals who bound together to try and make it through these horrid times completely littered with unknown risks.  The acting is superb, the special effects from the sets to the make-up are excellent.  The show takes some plot liberties, straying away from the graphic novels from time to time, but this just makes it more interesting for both - the TV viewers and the fans of the graphic novels.

If you enjoy a show with really exciting plots with twists and cliffhangers, as well as excellent character development, then I highly recommend this series.  Renting or purchasing it from Amazon.com is a very convenient way to stream the series to your smart device, tablet, or PC...  or like some geeky folks have done - an HD Projector and Stereo System.  8-)",1416441600,,1605,4.628975265017668

4291673,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I thought this was going to be just another Zombie show..... I saw it spoken of on Fox-News and decided to give it a try. If you can get past the gore there's a story there unfolding that not just touches but ""Strike's"" home real heard for every human on the planet. It's about life, the choices people make (write-wrong, good and bad).
  It give as true an example of what the author see's (and has every right to believe) the world will be in the event of a complete system Melt-Down in ours and every country. Humans are just that, human. God gave us all free-choice to decide how we want to view life and it's reason, and worth. God also left us with instructions that fewer and fewer humans take time to even look at. With this series, set In a society that has fallen apart, one see's all the choices and there reason's played out in short and long term. Do I believe in ""ZOMBI'S"", heck-no. Do I believe in the desperation of humans, and there different ways of responding to tragedy? ""Heck-Yes""! In real life I'm a paramedic of 20+ years.
  I also know we live in a society that has had it so-good for so long that what-ever happens to our structure and the survival of all people will be defined by every-one's understanding of the value of life and what ""we"" rear our offspring to understand. This ""SHOW"" is well worth the time it takes to watch, but.... Not as much as reading (And Studying) the Holey Bible. After all? The show isn't real but all who endure it see that the stories in it are much like what we face on a very minute level every day with life, work, home, and simple survival....But Life, Choices, and Gods word very much are-real. I suggest Both for all. After all, how much time do any of us really have?

Walking Dead isn't just a zombie TV show.  It's a show of wits, errors, friendship, betrayal and human nature in the face of horrifying events.  It's a testament to great writing and good acting.

Season One of this show should be enough to ensnare any viewer and turn them  to a repeat customer.  The hoopla was justifiably deserved.",1414368000,,460,4.675

4291705,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I'll be honest with you, I've been terrified of zombies since I was little (the whole flesh rotting and eating people thing never really sat well with me).  When I heard they were making a zombie show for AMC all I could think was ""nope... I'm out"".  Luckily my best friend convinced me to give The Walking Dead a try and I was hooked.  Yes, I was initially creeped out by the walkers but the fact that it focused on the survivers made it easier for me to watch.  I like the fact that our story is basicly Rick's story - him being thrown into the zombie apocolypse, learning as he goes, and trying to find his family... all while trying to balance the rules of the new world with the laws of the old.

You can see that this is a passion project from all parties involved, from Darabont to Nicotero to Kirkman to the actors themselves.

The Walking Dead was my gateway into the zombie genre.  Watching this lead to things like the Night of the Living Dead (the original)... that I would've otherwise missed out on.",1413849600,,1013,4.328042328042328

It didn't let me down.  I suspect that I would have been hooked on it when the first season began, had I started watching it then.  The characters are so well developed that after a while you come to know them and how they think.  I still don't know how the world got into the situation it did with these stories, but it really doesn't matter.  This series is all about the characters, how they handle their situation, how they work together (or don't) and how they get from day to day in a hopeless world.  The action and mystery of what will happen next never stops and never ceases to surprise me.  I can't wait for the next season to start, and may even go back and watch all the others all over again.  Once I started watching Season 1, I watched all 6 episodes in 2 sittings.  LOVE this series!",1410652800,,973,4.262295081967213

I'm one of those skeptics to this show and now look at me! I'm absolutely in love with the show. I'm more into manga but I may find myself wanted to at least buy the graphic novel!

Its not a zombie, zombie movie, its more realistic and sensitive series which has my respects and by far I haven't seen a zombie movie that's well ""hell bent"" into showing a long life of human perspective. So its sorta like a soap opera/scifi ^.^ And I hate drama and soap opera by the way so check this out!

4291807,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I am not one who is into zombie movies or stories. They usually don't interest me. However almost from the start I became a fan of the ""Walking Dead"". This is a well done series that will keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what is going to happen next. Great acting, great directing and great writing has come to make ""Walking Dead"" one of the most popular televisions shows today. You never know what to expect with the story line of this show.

The first season alone has its share of twists and turns to the story but if you get into the series and watch the other season to this show you will find yourself dropping your jaw many times as you watch how the story progresses. One good example of this is how over the seasons regular cast members have suddenly been killed off on the show. If you start watching this show and develop a favorite character be warned you could at any point find them suddenly dead. Also know for the squeamish this series can get a bit gory, especially in the later seasons, but because the story is so compelling to watch I find that I can look past all that and in fact I have come to have gotten use to it.

 If you can get past all the gory stuff I promise you will find an excellently made series which is something it seems you can't say for most television shows today. Give this series a try. You definitely want to start watching the first season so you can keep up with who is who on the show and understand better situations that will occur in the later seasons. Speaking though as someone who is not into zombies I do highly recommend this series.",1408320000,,1610,4.254901960784314

4291812,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"I like horror movies, end of the world stories and have no issue with gratuitous violence.  As  zombies aren't my favourite things that go bump in the night, I didn't jump on ""the Walkng  Dead "", bandwagon at first, however so many friends have told me how great it is and while I was recently in the US I even saw a couple of episodes of a later season.  That is why I decided to purchase season 1.  Which is also why I didn't read the description, I was flabbergasted that my jet lag series was only 6 episodes.  I was just getting involved in the characters when boom, season over.

The fact that it only has six episodes is not why I gave it a 3 though.  I had expected that the initial episodes would be slow in order to build the universe as well as introduce us to what is supposed to be an ensemble cast, however, I was not expecting predictable story lines.  In additionIn I saw  fairly predictable characters, the do gooder, the bad boy who wants to be good, the long suffering wife, the bigoted but useful redneck, with a few people of color thrown in.  More important, is that as I was getting to know characters, they just disappear and don't show up again.  It's a possibility that some are due to show up in season 2, but as it was, I was left hanging at the end of the 6th episode.

So while I do recommend season 1 , so that you understand the universe and what drives the individual characters, I Highly recommend that you purchase season 2 at the same time, so that you don't get left hanging.

I am eagerly awaiting season 2 to see if my friends were correct and to see if watching the humdrum of season 1 was worth it.",1407715200,,1639,4.194888178913738

4291931,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I started my ""Walking Dead"" experience at the begininging of Season 4 and absolutely fell in love with the show! But now since I have to impatiently wait til next Fall for season 5 I thought well why not buy the first 3 seasons and check those out while I wait. I honestly didn't think that the first 3 seasons would be as good as the 4th but I WAS VERY WRONG! These first 3 seasons where just as, if not even more, amazing! I especially loved seeing Season 1 and watching how this world unfolded from the begining. You can't help but fall in love with Rick and his amazing Character, you feel like you are really there with him. I Love this show!",1400112000,,647,4.184

4291934,5,B0049P1ZZQ,The Walking Dead is one of the greatest series to ever air on television. Every aspect of the show is brilliant. The actors and screen crew all do their jobs above and beyond. Anyone who has never seen this series should jump on board the band wagon now because this is a show that will never be forgotten. Great horror mixed with the fight to hang on to morality in a world where the dead walk in hunger and the living fight for survival.,1399939200,,439,4.238095238095238
4291935,5,B0049P1ZZQ,to make a long story short if you like this type of movie you should truly buy it. only complaint is a little pricey considering the total length/time of it.,1399852800,,157,4.266666666666667

4291937,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"On a whim (and because my husband loves all things undead) I purchased the Walking Dead books (Volumes) for him one Christmas, hoping that he would at least think they were all right (he is very particular). By the end of the day, he had blown through Volumes 1-3 and I am pretty sure he didn't finish them all in one day only because we had holiday festivities to attend!!

I, being a comic book reader myself, was curious about the books so I decided to give them a try, figuring I wouldn't like them because of the zombie aspect to them. I was, to my delight, completely wrong. I was hooked by the end of the first story and we have been reading them faithfully ever since. We even lend out the Volumes to our friends when we purchase them.

When we heard about them making a TV series out of the comic books, my husband was ecstatic, but I was a little skeptical. Well, again I was proven wrong.

I'm not a professional critic and won't try to act like one. All I can say is that I enjoy the series as much as I enjoy the comics, and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the show to pick up the comics and see for yourself. I find the characters engaging and the storyline engrossing and sometimes heart-rending. Some of the episodes are like emotional roller coaster rides, and the slower episodes serve as fantastic character/group dynamics development.

Some people may be put off by the gore, as am I (I don't like to watch the show by myself), but if you can get passed that, this is truly a fantastic dramatic series that will keep you coming back for more!!",1399766400,,1568,4.341296928327645

I  bought the first season without even seeing one episode, and boy I made a great decision. The first episode will get you hooked and make you want more. Sadly your soon growing addiction will only have 6 episodes to feed on, but those 6 episodes are epic. It isn't just about the walkers, it's about the characters. This series if very character driven, and it will drive you to care, worry, and love each character. This is simply one of the best shows on television right now and you'd be silly to not watch it. This is where it all started, get it now.",1399161600,,652,4.174603174603175

4291951,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"In my opinion, the zombies are secondary to the incredible human character development. It's the kind of story you don't want to end after an hour.

4291982,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"A man in a coma is left for dead when the zombie apocalypse strikes.  He wakes up (from the verge of death) to discover that the world as he knows it has been overrun by the undead.  How appropriate.  This is the season that started it all.  I've recently gone back to watch Season 1 again and was stuck again at the

You won't see the scariest undead on this show.  It's just not exceptionally scary or gory and that's not what makes this show great.  More than anything, its really about the living and what they do in a world that has been turned upside down.  What do they do after losing loved ones?  What do they do when faced with certain death (or undeath).  What do they do to retain their humanity and preserve their community?

Zombie stories have been told and retold countless times.  Yet most typical zombie stories are more heavily focused on the zombies than the people.  And like the zombies, the stories often meander mindlessly.  They are gory and scary for the sake of being so (and cause the audience loves it).  Not with Walking Dead.  At the center of it all is a drama about the living, sure in a world where they have to survive an onslaught of undead.  But above all its, its about their interactions with each other.  The people, the characters and the actors, and their interactions are what make this show compelling.

If you've never seen it, check it out, on Amazon, or a number of other online services.  If you're a fan, watch some of the episodes again.  You'll be surprised to discover that there is still more to learn about the characters and their back story, even the second time around.",1395705600,,1626,4.444067796610169

IT WAS AWESOME!!! In fact, it was better than I was even expecting it to be, this could have gone totally bad and extremely watered down, thankfully, this was not the case, this was a fun, exciting, and very interesting first season, great characters and each episode leaves you hungry for more!

That said, I absolutely love TWD. Season 1 has been my favorite season. I consider the first episode to be one of the best single episodes of any show in any genre that I have ever seen. There is not a bad actor in the bunch. It is not a show about zombies, it is a show about people trying to survive. You could drop the same characters into any post-apocalyptic scenario and I imagine the show would be just as successful. The Zombies, aka Walkers, are the backdrop. The character development is so strong and the moral challenges they face will have you debating right and wrong with fellow TWD fans. I recommend starting with Season 1 and all other seasons of this incredible show.",1394409600,,868,4.465408805031447

Premise was standard zombie yawn. I hear it gets better but wasn't worth it for me. They lost me at the strobing hospital lights and hands reaching through the door and finally, mostly at the hissing ""scary sound"" the zombies make. I was hoping for something new and interesting. But if you want zombie silliness, I strongly recommend ""Sean of the Dead.""

Well acted, well written, well cinematized; you put yourself right in the thick of the characters' predicaments.  This is not just zombies - this is a study in actual survival for those who watch.  It could be a study in ANY type of apocalypse whether it be disease, grid problems. you name it.  How to survive without the life niceties.  I watch the series with my grandson and make sure we discuss the character development.  He gets it which makes me proud; we don't focus on the zombies, we focus on the characters' situations and how they grow internally show after show from one season to the next.  The zombies are a way to lure viewers; the acting and character maturity keep viewers.  How would YOU react; it makes you think.  I highly recommend you show this series to your early teens, watch it with them, then discuss after each episode. The torment of some personalities is palpable and you ache watching their suffering, but yet rejoice when they accept and resolve their situations and plod on.",1394150400,,1078,4.691489361702128

4292027,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"In fact I hate zombie movies and shows and anything zombies. Just looking at them you can imagine how they smell and the fact that they eat you doesn't help either. But I decided that I was going to face my fear and watch this show. I can't even see a commercial for this show without turning away in fear and I don't like to just shut things down without giving them a chance. There were moments of watching this show where it got so scary I had to bury my face in a pillow and nearly turned it off but I stuck with it and I'm happy I did because now I'm hooked. The shock of seeing the zombies has worn off completely. I can watch this show at night and not be scared s***less to turn off my light to go to sleep.

I will say most of the women on this show I DID NOT LIKE!! Why is it that women always have to be the dumb ones? Lori was a sk*nk, I'm not shacking up with my husband's best friend no matter how hot he is (and Shane was HOT), mere months after my husband's ""death"". Most women wait a while before they start dating after the death of a spouse, and some women never date again. My dad died twenty years ago and my mom is still single. Also there are zombies walking around, I'm not getting my freak on in the woods when it's basically the end of the world.

Andrea was an idiot. Now I'm a feminist I believe I can do pretty much the same things most men can do but I know my limits. If my boyfriend is like babe I've got that don't lift it or don't touch it, I'm going to let him handle it. Andrea seriously got on my nerves. When she shot, or skimmed rather, Daryl I was so disgusted. Like really? Everyone's telling you not to shoot and you do it anyway? That makes women look stupid and that's not cool in my book.

I loved Carol, she felt like the most real of all the women. She was afraid out of her mind but she was also logical. I liked Maggie because she was tough but I didn't like how clingy she became. I mean to suggest that Glen share her room with her in her father's house and for Glen to tell her is wasn't right, took her from being tough to needy.

Michonne is the chick! I love her and love to see a strong no nonsense, not taking cr@p, woman. Maybe it's just me but I would LOVE to see Michonne and Rick get together because she's so strong and he needs that sometimes especially when everyone is looking at him to make things right. He's only human, he can't take care of everything. I think Michonne would be the perfect match for him because she could be his rock. It seems like Carl respects her also so I think she would be good for him too.

All and all it's a really good show and now that I can watch it without covering my eyes every five minutes, I will. I've never read the comic book and was thinking about it just to see where the story goes, but I won't. I'd rather be surprised!!",1393804800,,2831,4.01241134751773

So having heard all the positive hype for this series, I decided to give it a try.
OK, so let's say the world is hit with a plague that turns almost everyone into things that have to eat live human meat.
If the people unaffected can hide and hold out for about 3 weeks, all the zombies will starve to death and the living can start trying to rebuild.
And why do all the zombies have something broken?  Surely as everyone was catching the disease, they couldn't have all been in car wreck at once, right?
I watched two episodes.  Same old lame stuff surrounded by a soap opera.  Dull, dull, dull.  I wasted $3.98 and almost 2hours of my time on these episodes.",1393113600,2,788,4.489510489510489

4292045,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love the lead in to this series by AMC, the weeks prior to the 1st episode AMC advertisements for it had Rick dressed in his Deputy sheriff uniform on a horse in Atlanta, with the old hit song by the Walker brothers playing in the background, The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine any more. Actually its the only time the song plays and I never hear it in the series. They should have kept it, it was PERFECT, genius advertising. Very appropriate for the show too. This first season is really good, establishing characters and relationships. Without spoilers if you haven't seen it. Its great zombie fare, even if you never thought you would like zombie shows, this really gets its hooks into you, or should I say teeth? LOL.",1392940800,,715,4.507692307692308

Buy one and if you like zombies movies then try this one.  Because I really don't think you will regret it.,1392854400,,282,4.054545454545455

4292049,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I heard a lot of talk about this series and wasn't sure what to think so I bought season 1 and now I am addicted to it and am halfway through season 3. I've never seen a series so able to keep shocking me week after week. I'm not talking about the shock of the blood and gore which there is a lot of (including spatters on the lens and many scenes of organs and flesh being eaten). That is a little gross but not really shocking (after the first few episodes). the shocks come from the willingness to kill off any character at any time so it is never predictable. The relationships and interactions are always changing and are always interesting. This show is totally engrossing and will make you binge watch it.,1392595200,,712,4.32089552238806

My wife missed the granddaughters spending as much time as they used to (they are now nearly 13 and 11, respectively.) I thought well (can you hear the gears in the admirals' scheming bridge-mind going on) we bribe them with ice cream and stuff so why not buy this. Soon they were spending the night and we started watching this. This show is very well done and does not leave you with that cheesy b-rated (bad) movies aftertaste (The Zombies That Ate The Taliban - oh, god, I'm a terrorist target, now.)

4292133,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is one of the best TV shows I have seen in a long time. The show focuses on a Cop named Rick Grimes who was in a coma and wakes up to the Zombie Apocalypse. During the show, you follow Rick on his journey to search for his family and watch as he tries to find a place for his group to survive. The Walking Dead is great show because it focuses on human vs. human as well as human vs. zombie. The show will keep asking you "" When the world is a zombie apocalypse, do you team up to fight the zombies or do you fight each other and follow survival of the fittest?""",1388880000,,579,3.8739495798319328

4292135,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM SOME ARE HAVING WITH EPISODE 2, ""GUTS."" IT APPEARS THAT SOME ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE ENTIRE FOOTAGE (3+ MINUTES OR SO) CONCERNING THE GROUPS TAKING INDOORS ""WAYNE DULAP"", THE DEAD, WALKER. THIS FOOTAGE OF GORE AS THE GROUP HACKS AWAY AT HIM WITH AN AXE IN GRAPHIC DETAIL. I TOO HAVE SEEN THIS DELETION. BUT, YOU CAN SEE IT ALL! A SIMPLE CHANGE AS TO HOW YOU BEGIN WATCHING THE FIRST DISC IS KEY. SIMPLY VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE EPISODE IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN CLICKING ""PLAY ALL."" TO VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE PLAY, YOU WILL SEE EVERY FRAME OF INTENDED GORE AND BLOOD! OR AS REAL AS IT WAS INTENDED! I HOPE THIS CLEARS THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF ""MISSING FOOTAGE.""
 As a Verified Amazon Purchased item, I can attest to this with my honesty and heart. Growing up on the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", that movie scared me for years. To this day, it still sends shivers down my spine. In fact, the only thing that truly gets my heart pounding in fright, is the dead coming back to life! For decades hundreds of movies have imitated, but never duplicated that 1968 low-budget film. One man's view took others with him and the select few became giants in the industry in their own right. Tom Savini was Romero's make-up & special effects artist on NOTLD and he branched off to make the dead more real in his views. Another man, Greg Nicottero, followed Savini, and in time, along with Howard Berger, became the predominant forces when it came to bringing the dead to life. Fast forward to 2010.
When I heard whispers at Horror Conventions that the Graphic Novel I loved, ""The Walking Dead"" would be picked up by AMC for a single, 6 episode season, I knew my dreams of NOTLD had come full circle. Having met Mr. Romero on several occasions, I had asked him of his thoughts on the TV jump? He just said, ""If anyone can pull this off, Greg can."" That was golden for me. But how does one take a comic of sorts and turn it into a TV series?
AMC gave the go-ahead for an unprecedented attempt to where TV had not gone before. No different than Star Trek and the realms it charted. Wow. Was I shocked and happily worth the 50 year wait!
Robert Kirkman's take on the ""Undead"" was and is breathtaking. While there are certain differences between the Graphic Novel & TV show, some subtle, others much more outright, ""The Walking Dead Season 1"" was absolutely brilliant! Sure, the first episode mirrors ""28 Days Later"" as Rick Grimes awakes from a coma to find the world has turned upside down, he remains true to his Sheriff's law abiding ways. As well as a man seeking his wife and son. Only to find every BODY he passes is either ""put down"" or NOT! As he arrives to his home, his life, you see what I believe any of us would do. Collapse. He breaks down as he realizes that all he knew is no more, but with a grip on ""maybe?"" He patrols outdoors to his former neighbors home. Only to be whacked with a shovel by an even more scared Duane. Only a child himself trying to deal with DEAD PEOPLE NOT STAYING DEAD! As Rick regains his wits for a sec, he sees Morgan with a muzzle in his face. Wait? Isn't Rick the Sheriff? No wonder he passes out! We as the audience do not need the growing ensemble cast yet. Rick needs to learn about the new reality first, first hand. The brief cut-aways at his prior gun shot are necessary for US to learn about him. Rick learns of the world from Morgan and Duane. All the while Morgans pathetic wife mopes just outside because Morgan himself still hasn't come to terms yet. And he is 1 month into this insanity!
All in this first episode, the 3 members must deal with this together. Yet prepare to go separate ways. An amazing moment when Morgan has his new rifle that Rick gave him. One full month on of his morbid wife lurking outside the front door, and the Human Element keeps him from putting her down. He knows she is dead. It is the right thing to do. But the LOVE keeps him from pulling that trigger. Duane knows the moment is near and covers his ears and cringes with fright! Morgan hesitates. He is not ready to deal with the ""Walking Dead."" Fore his wife is not his wife anymore. Given the chance, she would tear into his flesh in a sec! Rick drives off in a Sheriff's car in search of Lori and Carl. He KNOWS they made it. He hangs onto this simple yet strong notion. If not, then all hope is truly lost! All in the first episode!
I shall not go on about the remaining 5 episodes of Season 1. By now, I'm sure most of you have either seen them or know about them. Many on here have written much as I. Yes, some hate the premise of Zombies altogether. I say to them, just don't watch, don't read this and change the channel. As Bruce Springstien sang, ""500 channels and nothing to watch."" I'm sure there is. As for myself and Millions of loyal Undead fans, THIS is exactly what we have been waiting for.
All thanks to George A. Romero and his original vision of ""NIGHT OF THE FLESH EATERS."" I'm so glad that name never took!
I am highly recommending this set in Blu-Ray! To watch this in the best possible clarity and sound is like nothing else! I have also purchased ""The Walking Dead Seasons 2&3"" on Blu-Ray as well. I shall be leaving follow-up reviews for them as well. By far, aside from the original ""Star Trek Series"", AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" is the BEST thing on cable television...",1388793600,,5382,4.333994053518335
4292136,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I used to watch a lot of horror movies in my teens, and maybe 20's.  I'm not an old geezer yet at 40, but with family, work, age, etc I guess I've gotten softer as I really don't enjoy horror anymore.  I don't like roller coasters, go carts, or extreme sports either.  I really can't remember the last true horror movie I've seen.  BUT... I heard a lot about this tv series and was very curious.  I watched the first episode and I was hooked from the first few seconds.  I watched all four seasons (it's in the middle of season 4 now) in a few weeks and loved every bit of it.  This is a great show.  Lots of gore but lots more good drama.",1388793600,,639,4.015873015873016

4292139,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"Over new years AMC ran all the episodes of this show again and since everybody is raving about it  I thought that I would tape these and give it a try.  Everyone said that it's not so much about the horror of the zombies but about the people who pull together and what they do to survive.  It's a terrible thing to have to contemplate the end of your country and all that it stands for but it's even more terrible to see that people love the destruction and violence so much, what has happened to us as a country?  This thing literally made me sick.  One of the first scenes was a law officer shooting a tiny little girl carrying a bunny and wearing slippers, he shot her in the head without even a blink.  After New Town to see a child shot was the most hurtful, and the complaints of gun violence in this country are growing bigger every day but people want to just drink this show down, the violence is alright if it's television?  We are literally becoming desensitized  to violence in our country and in our world and you see evidence of this in the mass shootings that keeps occuring in our country or the bombings with no thought to human life.  When did human life have no value?  And as a married middle aged woman to see this same cop's wife thinking her husband is dead what maybe two weeks? So this woman with a boy under the age of 10 decides to have sex with her husbands former partner?  Does this not bother anybody either?  Are we not better as a people than to sit down and watch this horrible depressing and nightmarish show?  I watched two episodes and decided to call it quits and I spoke to my husband before I erased it all and asked if he wanted me to keep it and he said no that the first thing of the child being shot made him upset also.  We live in the greatest country in the world but I feel like we are sliding off the edge of decency and morality.  So the final word is this and here goes, I did not like this and can think of better things to do with my time than watching people get slaughtered and eaten, this is not entertainment!  I did not find any unity or special survival instincts among the character's in this show, it's not exciting or a thrill to watch something gross and violent that does not have any hope at all, in the end they are all going to die.  There are better shows out there, Grey's anatomy, Criminal minds, Personal of interest, Grimm, Dead Files or how about American Ride with Stan Ellsworth?  You want to feel good and experience the joy of what your country is all about give Stan a shot on BYU television, To hear that man speak about the history of our country will bring you to tears of gratitude of who we are as a people and as for the Zombie thing well maybe you might want to ask yourself a question which is why you like it so much.  And maybe we should question why a cable network thinks it's fine to make such a show and better yet how many of our young men who have been playing video games full of violence and death and you get points or levels for the most killing and this seems to be the main audience for this show so is there a connection between violent media and the mental illness in our young people, the one's driven to kill?  I think that this is more than a show but a statement about the times in which we live. Update: well I wrote the truth as I saw it and have had many people get extremely upset and intimidated on my view of this television program and one comment in particular I would like to respond to which is ""how can I make a decision about this show after seeing only two episodes?"" Well if someone plays you a type of music and you hate it do you need to listen to every album to know it's not for you? Someone feeds you dinner and it's horrible do you need another plateful to tell you it's bad? I stand by what I wrote but what's more I think this show it detrimental to the young people watching it and what's more one day when you hit your middle years your going to look back and wonder why you ever watched this in the first place and parents out there I would seriously consider never letting a teenager watch this horrible violent thing and take a page out of Sue Kleibolds book and maybe avert catastrophe. Our young people need help it's why we are called parents and not friends because kids do not have the intellect to understand that even though it excites them it's not good for them.",1388707200,9,4404,4.18321513002364

I like how it isn't just constant fights with walkers but it also shows more what the people go through in such. Obviously, it isn't realistic, but in my opinion it is more so than other movies/shows about walkers taking over. The directors and Robert Kirkman do a great job of developing the character and making the viewers become attached to them.
The show is based off of the comic series by Robert Kirkman. The comic series is also enjoyable but viewers be mindful the show does not follow the comics exactly.",1388620800,,589,4.566037735849057

I was hesitant about this one because I thought it would be too dark and scary with nothing but zombies but there's actually a great show with a wonderful and captivating plot. AMC has raised the bar for quality television and their shows are surprisingly well written and feature actors who have little fame and are proving themselves to be great in their breakout roles.

You don't expect certain main characters to die, but they do and sometimes without any warning and you are sitting there in shock. The acting is great.

It is not so much the zombies that is the draw but the human Dynamic and their struggle for survival.  I truly enjoyed how the story shows the struggles faced by the group and their need to hold on to what was.  This series is not for everyone, but I know that even the drama and occasional horror movie goer will enjoy this series.  Definitely not for children.",1386633600,,535,4.155339805825243

4292213,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"My objective is to keep this review just about season 1 of The Walking Dead.  However, given the direction that later seasons have taken, it is necessary to discuss later seasons for comparisons sake.

  Season 1 starts off with a scene lifted almost directly from 28 Days Later, with sheriff Rick Grimes waking up from a gunshot induced coma to discover he is in a deserted hospital that looks like it was the site of an apocalyptic nightmare.  Of course, we know that several months earlier a pandemic virus that kills its victims and reanimates them as walking dead overran the Deep South and, from all indications, the rest of the nation, if not the world.  While Rick was unconscious, his wife (Lori), son (Carl) and best friend (Shane) all were forced to escape the cities with other refugees.  Ricks goal is to try to find survivors, with the hope that his wife and son are among them.

  Based on the wildly popular graphic novel of the same name, and hitting television sets at a time where popular cultures interest in zombies was at its zenith, The Walking Dead had a very auspicious start.  The tension, drama and suspense as Rick joins up with a group of survivors, that includes his family, is palpable.  His determination to find a solution to this crisis by taking a group into Atlanta to the Centers for Disease Control leads to several other compelling encounters with different survivor groups who are persevering in their own way.  The additional drama brought about by Ricks unexpected resurrection creates massive conflicts between Shane and Lori.

  Season 1 comes to stunning climax when Rick and his group learn that there is no quick solution from the one surviving CDC employee.  The subsequent seasons will be about the long haul survival of these people.

  One of the biggest disappointments about Season 1 has nothing to do with Season 1.  The problem is that none of the following seasons ever managed to come close to the narrative pace and excitement of these first episodes.  The one dimensional caricatures of the first season were not as big of an issue as the plot continued to rapidly advance.  Unfortunately, as the producers decided to artificially inflate story lines to increase the number of episodes they could run, the failure to engage in any meaningful character development because exacerbated by plot elements that moved slower than molasses in January.

  However, Season 1 can remain a shining example of how to kick off ambitious show.  It can also remain as a reminder of what the show failed to live up to in later seasons.",1385251200,,2578,4.8
4292214,4,B0049P1ZZQ,I am not a big Zombie fan but I enjoy the scenario that this show proposes. This series is character driven not zombie driven and that is why I think it is so successful. My only issue with the first season was that there were only six episodes. Outside of that it is a great series that only gets better and more addictive.,1385078400,,324,4.158730158730159

4292219,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"If you do not suffer from zombie burnout, get ready. While I think the show is well-made, it was instrumental in me getting really tired of zombies.

Walking dead is so much more than a show about zombies but can be compared to political and social aspects if you really pay attention. I've yet to find an inconsistency in the writing or directing

I love Movies about Zombies and End of the World Scenarios, not that I would ever wish for that reality though.  Zombies Movies have been my favorite Movies ever since the original Dawn of the Dead came out in theaters in 1978.  I like The Walking Dead Series because the movie shows respect for the dead - they are treated like they are real and it is actually happening that the dead are walking the Earth.  I also like the fact that the dead are not thinking or running like living people; movies that do have the dead seeming to start thinking or having them running ruin the experience of having a world where the dead walk amongst us.  All movies that deal with the dead coming back should take notes and emulate The Walking Dead.",1381708800,,855,4.31875
4292283,5,B0049P1ZZQ,My daughter got me watching this and it's a great series can't wait to own them all! I started watching them on Netflix and decided to own it.,1381536000,,142,4.107142857142857

4292287,5,B0049P1ZZQ,One of the most suspensful but disturbing shows I've seen.  Characters are great and storyline is really scary.  Can't wait to catch up on all the rest of the episodes so I can catch the new season.,1381363200,,198,4.324324324324325
4292288,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I like the story and the characters are credible. The blood and gore is pretty well done.

4292289,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"My friend kept bugging me to watch. She's right- it's really good. The blood and violence was a bit much at first, but then I realized that this is the only show I watched recently with blood and gore that is not based on cases in the headlines. I actually had stopped watching Criminal Minds and the CSI shows because it was just too real and too disturbing what humans are capable of doing to each other. This show- totally fake, not realistic, but a well written fantasy story with characters I love or hate, so somehow it works. I still look away sometimes, but it really is one of my favorites now.",1381017600,,603,4.345132743362832

Packaging is extremely flimsy.  It arrived caved in and torn when I opened the shipping box.  Now it won't even stand up properly - it leans.

It's more of a ""boy thing"" I think, so if you have brothers, friends, boyfriends, etc. they will probably like the zombie killing gore and epic action going on.  I tried to be involved in the ""soapy"" parts of the show, like Rick's marital issues, but by the end of episode one, I was just ""meh.""  I will probably end up watching it with my friend, because he loves it to death, but it's not something I would seek out on my own.",1377561600,,510,4.1313131313131315

A friend lent me the first two seasons on DVD and after one very long week where I think I slept with my bedroom door locked every night, I got through both seasons and found....I wanted more. Even if you aren't a fan of the horror genre, this show is for you. I learned very quickly that The Walking Dead is not a show about zombies - sure there a LOT of zombies - but about what happens to people when the world goes to crap and all you have left are a few individuals fighting for a small slice of life during a difficult situation.

Don't get me wrong, this is no ""Shawshank Redemption"" but it is great. So much so that I am now a lifelong fan and can't wait until season 4 starts in October.",1377043200,,1047,4.132352941176471

I flipped through the channels and just stopped on AMC to watch it and I was there the rest of the day. The only problem was I was confused because it was season 3. So of course I had to buy all 3 seasons then.

I love this show and even got my husband addicted to it when he HATES zombie movies! We both really enjoy watching this and right now are waiting impatiently for season 3 to be shipped and October for season 4 to start!

4292357,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is one of my favorite TV Shows right now. The first season, which is composed of only 6 episodes, it's not my favorite season. I bought this season because I want to own the entire series but I would've just bought Season 2 and Season 3 instead. Regardless I recommend because there is, in fact, way more people that differ my opinion.

I takes you about 4 episodes to start caring for the characters but when you do, you can't stop.

I had a problem with Amazon.com and that was that I didn't get the cardboard sleeve that comes with the blu-ray to protect it. I called and returned it and they sent me the same thing. Finally, they ended up giving me a promo. So problem solved I guess. But I'm still disappointed because I didn't get the cardboard protective sleeve.

4292367,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"If you haven't watched the Walking Dead yet you need to read this review.
Your probably saying to yourself, ""I don't like that type of program"" or ""It's not for me, I don't like horror or zombies""
This is where this show differs. The main story is about a zombie apocalypse, but that is where it starts, it goes way beyond that to a basic survival story. Without getting into the story too much it traces the story of an ordinary man (a sheriff) who's life is thrown into chaos when he is shot on duty and goes into a coma. when he wakes after the apocalypse he is searching for his family (wife and son) and what he discovers is horrifying.
I started watching this show from episode 1 and that's how you need to see it. The first five minutes will hook you.
After that you will be a fan for life. When the show first aired in 2010 I watched it and told my sister about it. She said ""I'm not interested in that"" and I told her if she watched the first episode she would be hooked. Fast forward to one year later and the second season was about to start so AMC was having a marathon of the first season. I told my sister to DVR it and watch it when she had time. She did that, and when she did she started watching the show on a Friday night, she couldn't stop watching until 2:00 in the morning, she was hooked. This is a person who never liked horror movies, zombie movies etc.
While this little story might not get everyone interested in the show, I hope I get at least a few people to watch, once you do..................................you'll  be  hooked!!!!!!!!!
I hope I have been helpful.",1375574400,,1595,4.260726072607261

4292369,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I originally wasn't going to watch this series as I am more of a 'vampire' fan than a 'zombie' fan but my niece had me watch a couple of series with her a couple of times and I was hooked!,1375488000,,188,3.725

This show FAR exceeds what have admittedly become low expectations in this genre.  The zombies are AMAZINGLY done (make-up, effects, whatever) and the character development is, in some cases, complex.  This show is about so much more than the end of the world -- it's about who WE become when civilization dies.  Do we regress to being animals once more, cling to what's left of our humanity, or evolve/adapt?  You name it, this show covers it.  If you haven't seen it, BUY IT.

After a few episodes of this awful garbage was crammed down my throat I actually had to ask ""can we please not watch this anymore?""  Nothing happens... ever.  There's zombies and a few backwoods idiots who have survived somehow.  The worst part of this show is the dialogue between characters in moments that look like everyone has expressions like it's important but the talking is just as useless as the zombie groaning around them.",1374969600,12,480,4.888888888888889

Maybe future seasons pick up the pace, but I'll wait for it to hit Prime (if it ever does).  As far as AMC goes, I much prefer Mad Men, and in general I thought Falling Skies was a much more compelling series.",1374537600,,299,4.0508474576271185

4292385,5,B0049P1ZZQ,This show is one of those that makes you yearn for the next week to come quicker.

4292388,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I'm not into the whole zombie craze but this series is also about character development.  I have gotten many people hooked on this series because it's not what most would expect.  I highly recommend this series.,1374105600,,211,4.833333333333333

4292395,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Kind of pointless to review the show from a content perspective at this point, but in short I really enjoyed it.  The Blu-ray presentation here is terrific as well: the video quality and sound design are both high quality, while the extras on this three-disc collection are definitely worth the extra cash.  There's a fantastic documentary exclusive to Disc 3 that features a great amount of location footage as these episodes are being shot, with plenty of fun and interesting moments featuring the cast and crew.

The packaging also deserves special mention: it's a beautiful digipak design  with a nice matte finish and killer artwork.  The three-panel spread on the inside (where the discs are held) is a striking composite image featuring art from the comic blending with a cast photo.  As a whole, it's really aimed at die-hard fans...so if you're one of them, this is the version to buy.",1373846400,,894,4.887417218543046

I downloaded Season 1 to watch on my flight across the Atlantic (where clearly there are not a lot of options for entertainment.  The only reason that I finished watching was that I had very few alternatives to occupy me as I sat in my economy-class seat.  The zombies look ridiculous and are anything but scary.  There are a couple of scenes that are supposed to tug at your heart strings, but instead make you cringe at the bad acting.

But, I was hooked after the first episode!!!!  This show is SUPER well written, acting is top notch and the story os VERY compelling.  It will hook you no problem.  Yes, there are undead walking around being creepy but at its heart the show is about human nature, survival and family.  I am telling everyone who isn't already hooked to get on board.",1373155200,,493,4.304347826086956

4292409,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"There have been zombie movies, zombie shows, and zombie cartoons... Everything pales in comparison to the documentary-grade execution of The Walking Dead.  In a league of its own, the pilot-launching Season One has to be the best of all time!  Seriously, it redefines what a pilot can achieve!  Watch this alone, and you'll be hooked.

The make-up is world class. The story & acting are riviting.  The soundtrack is haunting.  The cinematography is dark and compelling.  It adds up to a new benchmark in cable series quality.

This is one of those productions that warrants BluRay...go the distance!  But not you Carl...Go back in the house!",1373155200,,641,4.971698113207547
4292410,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love this series and I can't even tell you why! I hate blood and gore and all the sound effects that go with it, and this series has plenty of it. Yet I continue to watch it episode after episode totally glued to the television watching it. Its not just a lot of dead people walking around aimlessly like you would see in an older movie about zombies or anything of the like. It's about human beings having to start all over again in a world that seems so hopeless. It's about people trying to survive in a world that no longer has any law and order, a world where you don't know who you can trust, a world where there doesn't seem to be any place to rest, a world where you have to engage in all that blood and gore or you will not survive. In fact I think this series is written so well that during one of their six month breaks I started watching it all over again from the beginning and was just as captivated as the first time I started watching it.",1373155200,,956,4.063492063492063

4292412,5,B0049P1ZZQ,This is the reason I got interested in zombies. Usually movies with blood and gore are not my type but the story line keeps you interested. The characters seem real and shows how we can and do change in times of unbelievable horror.,1372982400,,232,4.4186046511627906
4292413,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"When I heard people saying there was a great TV series that had to do with zombies I had my doubts. I thought it was going to be a little silly and therefore it took a long time for me to come back and decide to give it a shot. I was sorely mistaken, since once I started watching the first episode I was instantly hooked. There is nothing silly about this series, the story is cleverly crafted, there is suspense / horror for days and some of the plot twists will leave you breathless.

This is a short first season, so you can go through it in a day, but luckily the following seasons are longer (13 and 16 episodes for seasons 2 and 3 respectively). The creators do a great job with posing questions and slowly giving us information getting us closer and closer to the answer. For example, we instantly start to wonder about what caused the zombie a.k.a. ""walker"" outbreak? Also, what are the exact mechanics by which contagion works? and why walkers have to be killed a certain way.

Beside the great story line, there are some excellent performances in this series. I particularly like the job Jon Berthal, who plays an intense Shane, who was a police officer until the outbreak and who after everything changed rebuilt his world only to see things shift again drastically. Jon can communicate quite a bit with his eyes, and this is used quite a bit in the series. Norman Reedus is my other favorite actor in this series, he plays a redneck that has some handy abilities when shooting arrows and may also have a softer side in there somewhere.

My advice if you have not given this a try yet is to hurry up and do it already. Don't be like me. Once you start you will be watching these non-stop until you run out of episodes. Yes, the series is that good!",1372896000,,1760,4.376146788990826

4292432,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I decided to start watching this show to see what all the fuss was about. I was not prepared for how bloody and gruesome it was going to be. However, you do get a bit desensitized after watching the 50th zombie get its head blown off. The story here is what makes this good. There is great character development and you really care what happens to them. Every show ends with you wanting to watch the next one. We've watched 3 shows in a row because of the cliffhanger endings. Overall, if you can get past the gore it's a great show.",1371772800,,533,4.235294117647059

4292434,5,B0049P1ZZQ,One of the best shows ever made with some of the best actors. I been a fan of the walking dead for 2 years now and i gotta say i love it. I hope this turns out to be one of toughs long lasting shows kinda like the Mythbusters or what not. The disk were in good shape.,1371686400,,267,3.6206896551724137

4292437,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"I just can't understand all the hype regarding this show. There were too many deja vu -moments of the Falling Skies that I watched a few months ago: Empty world, civilization almost wiped out, stupid people. If you want to see zombies shot or hacked to pieces, there is a plenty of that... Even that wasn't my issue with the show, but the lack of interesting elements. Acting was ok, but it doesn't help much if the story is lacking. I have enjoyed several shows in the past, like Prison Break, SG-1, SG Atlantis, BSG and especially Babylon 5. Even though some of those were not necessarily perfect shows, never once did I have the urge to stop watching them like happened with every episode of the Walking Dead Season 1 (and Falling Skies Seasons 1&2).",1371340800,8,753,4.544117647058823

4292440,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I don't like the zombie thing but the characters are developed so nicely that you are endeared to them. The post apocalyptic element is awesome as well. Hoe do you survive a hopeless situation? I love Andrew Lincoln as Rick. Great choice of casting.,1371254400,,249,4.681818181818182

I borrow my friend's season 1 & 2 of the Walkng Dead recently....I was amazed!!!!!I LOVE it!:)I enjoyed it soooo much that I had to buy my own. Your heart goes out to those characters and you find yourself at the end of your seat watching in AHHHH and wanting & wondering what the next obstacle those poor characters are going to have to go through next and in the mean time they have to fight off all the walkers...(zombies). MY favorite character is Daryl. He comes off crusty & cold in the 1st season & in the 2nd season you just fall in LOVE with his character. Norman Reedus does an outstanding job playing this character. This tv series is amazing to watch, even if your not a zombie or a horror movie fan. It is bad ass and awesome.",1370649600,,880,4.152046783625731

I've re-watched this season with my sister as she never seen Walking Dead before and she loved it. Only thing I don't like about this DVD is that it seems to maybe have some deleted scenes? I know that on Netflix it shows whenever Lori cheated on Rick with Shane whenever they both went in the woods  together and did their thing, but it didn't show that scene on this DVD so I'm not sure what other scenes I might of missed that were not on the DVD but on Netflix.

You can't store this on your computer it's out there in cyber space somewhere and you have to have an internet connection to view it.

4292491,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I have been really burned out on zombie films or shows of late, but this show goes beyond a bunch of mindless zombies. This show is brutal (especially seasons 2 & 3) in the fact that they allow you plenty of opportunity to get attached to a character, then at the least expecting moment, rid them from the show by the most brutal methods that can be conjured. This applies to men women and children, once again showing that they have no regard for what characters they strip away from you. This show is about zombies, but more so about surviving the aftermath of the apocalypse.",1369008000,,578,4.462264150943396

There are 300 million firearms in the US and 99% of the people are dead, yet these people can't find any guns.  They drive the same crappy RV, always on the verge of breaking down, past entire highways and towns full of better vehicles.  The zombies are slow, yet somehow outrun the living, they can't cross even simple fences, yet are always able to sneak up to people ostensibly trying to save their own life.  It beggars belief that these people would ever survive anything more taxing than a riot, much less a zombie apocalypse.",1368835200,2,608,4.601851851851852

We watched the entire first season, hoping it would get better with each episode.  The acting and dialogue are absolutely terrible. Within each episode, the plot hardly develops at all and certain aspects just drag on. The writers spend way too much time on certain scenarios that don't contribute to the overall plot.

By episode 3,  I was begging her, ""No more please.  I can't take it.  It is too intense!""  She tortured me with one more episode and then sent me home to Illinois.

Upon my return, I jumped right online and purchased Seasons, 1, 2 & 3.  This is definitely a series I want to own.  ALWAYS.  The writing is great. It is loaded with action and peppered with just a little humor to ease the tension.  I love it.  Although, I am limiting myself to 3 episodes per week so that I can sleep at night.

4292537,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"This is a well done series in terms of quality, production, acting, etc., and I know I am in the minority. But, when I was half way through the first episode!!! and the ""dead"" ate the living horse, I ejected it and dumped it in the garbage. I do not care for ""gratuitous"" violence and surely there are ways, as have been executed on classic movies, to portray true horror without extreme graphic violence. This was not for me although I understand its underlying appeal.",1367712000,6,470,4.541176470588235
4292538,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I think this show was one of the best shows on television today. I love the stars and the rolls they play, even the villeins.

4292541,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"What can I add to the comments of thousands of Walking Dead lovers?  It's absolutely awesome.  Especially the first season.  I had never watched it on AMC the past few years, and finally decided to catch up, as I was left out of conversations due to my lack of viewing experience. So I watched the whole DVD in one day.  I love the characters - even the annoying ones - (Andrea, you know who I'm talking about....and Dale, once in a while you expound too much....Lori, I'm reserving my opinion of you - it can go either way...)  and the whole premise of the show.  With Dexter coming to an end, I hope The Walking Dead will fill the void in the next couple of years.  TV basically is stale.  I hate ""reality"" shows.  Ditto for the news media.  Give me the escapism of The Walking Dead any day......action all the way.",1367625600,,817,4.315789473684211

4292558,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"Well, after hearing all the ""rave"" reviews for this show I decided to give it a try.  AMC had a Walking Dead marathon a couple of months ago with all of Season 2 and Season 3 up to the most recent episode at that time.  I ordered Season 1 and enjoyed a few episodes despite how implausible and ludicrous the story line was.  Could the Walking Dead really take over almost the entire country/planet in a period of months???  Anyway, if you can suspend reality and enjoy the show for what it is...mindless, zombie slashing ""fun"" you will enjoy it.  Be prepared to increasingly have to suspend belief by the time you get to Seasons 2 and 3 though.  I think that episode 4 of Season 3 (""A Killer Among Us"" -- I think the episode is called) is when the show ""jumps the shark"" in my opinion.",1366588800,,785,4.27027027027027

4292565,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Police officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and the rest of the living find themselves in an epic battle to survive against a zombie apocalypse. The show is based on the graphic novel series by Robert Kirkman, although the producers and script writer Kirkman himself diverge from the graphic novels on occasions. For the few living, the best strategy is sticking together. Rick's group forms in this first season and immediately the viewer begins to become attached to the characters. The acting is excellent, the gore scenes are executed realistically, and the story is brilliant as we follow these main characters with their problem of survival and their interpersonal problems within the group. I gladly recommend this entertainment!",1366243200,,736,5.299145299145299

4292580,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This show (for those who don't know) is based off of a comic book series. Although the show strays away a bit, it's a great tv show. In my opinion, it's in the top 10 shows on tv. Being so different from the comic, you never know what is going to happen next. If you haven't seen it, I would strongly recommend it.",1365811200,,314,4.0

Sadly, I still cannot get into the whole zombie craze and I just could not get into this series, which I all-to-often found to be boring.",1365552000,,268,4.254901960784314

4292587,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I discovered The Walking Dead after Season 3 started. I never thought it would be my kind of show. I hate horror films, and I couldn't understand what was so compelling about a bunch of walking zombies. Well, I was wrong. The show is incredible. I ordered all 3 seasons and am now sad that I have to wait for Season 4. I watched all of these episodes while working out, and it kept me going! I would highly recommend this series. BTW, I am a fan of Downton Abbey, anything Jane Austen, The Good Wife, Homeland, and Game of Thrones. Walking Dead is about characters, lives, hope, faith, survival, persistence. And the situation is actually very realistic in this age of terrorism/bio terrorism. If you like excellent drama and acting, you'll love this.",1365465600,,751,4.611940298507463
4292588,5,B0049P1ZZQ,Finally started watching this after my boyfriend kept saying it was so great.  You do have to get used to a lot of blood being spattered around and I wouldn't recommend it for kids... but it really is well acted and has interesting plot lines.

4292589,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"What's better than an apocalypse?  That's right... an apocalypse with flesh eating zombies!
I love the show because it's much more than killing zombies and surviving... It's about people and how society acts and how we behave.  What used to be taboo or wrong is now right for survival.  It's an interesting study on just how fragile our societal rules are and how primal at the core humans really are. And... occasionally they find really cool ways to kill zombies!",1365465600,,465,4.7875
4292590,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I heard about The Walking Dead series from Halloween event based on the tv series at Universal Studios Hollywood. I saw the previews on the tram and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Let me tell you- AMAZING series! I watched it the first season in one weekend. I knew I was addicted. The Walking Dead Season 2 is just as addicting... if you haven't jumped on the band wagon.... NOW is the time!,1365379200,,405,4.2727272727272725

4292595,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I had to 'nag' my wife to watch this series, now SHE'S hooked!  The story line alone warrants watching it.  The 'zombies' AREN'T the subject but the catalyst which motivates the complex and believable characters to learn to give-in & die or survive in a world that is being nauseatingly destroyed and has started-from-scratch.  One of the best 'series' ever made... Rob Reiner was right when he said, ""With series' such as this, we HAVE entered a second ""Golden Age of Television""...",1365206400,,483,4.865853658536586

4292599,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Based on a comc book series. There is a reason this is such a popular show. It is consistently a well made show, all around. You never know who can/will die in each episode. A band of survivors make their way through the zombie apocalypse. For a tv show there is plenty of blood, and the zombies are often pretty gruesome.
This bluray set contains a web series of the ""bicycle girl"", which is really good too. Top notch creators in the industry contribute to this series weekly. If you have not seen it, check it out and see what the fuss is about. Yes it's a show about the zombie apocalypse. But you sometimes don't see zombies, except in the background. This is definitely a show about the interaction of people in this situation and how they deal with it.",1365033600,,759,4.390070921985815

Both the plot and zombies in ""Walking Dead"" are slow paced. ...The zombies in 28 Days
and vampires in 30 Days are HI-SPEED. As in Terrifying !!!

I enjoy watching the ""Walking Dead"". It's one of the better series on TV. But if you watch
28 Days or 30 Days and follow it up with The Walking Dead, you will find the The Dead

4292611,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I do not typically enjoy gorey fare on tv or at the movies, but the underlying storylines, character development and situational issues that must be dealt with in the zombie infested world of The Walking Dead have made me a diehard (no pun intended) fan. I usually look away during the truly gruesome parts, but it is so worth it so see what this band of survivors will be faced with next.",1364860800,,389,4.416666666666667

4292623,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I don't know how I got hooked on this very action and drama packed series. Zombies are ""not real"". But if we had some kind of world crisis, this I find most interesting because of the split second decisions for survival as a group. Great filming scenery, acting, plot, and the need for survival for some, not all. Displays the emotional terror and grief processes that would come along in this type of what if, situation. Absolutely hooked!!",1364428800,,441,4.666666666666667
4292624,5,B0049P1ZZQ,Awesome series.  Evem more awaeome in Blu-Ray.  I didn't think a show about zombies would keep as interested as I am now.  I'm looking forward to the 4th season.,1364428800,,161,4.482758620689655

4292633,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"This show is too dark and gritty for my tastes. I could see though that for people who can tolerate that sort of thing, it would probably be interesting to follow the personal stories as they develop - kind of like Lost but darker.",1364169600,,231,4.2727272727272725

4292646,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Drama, humor and best of all zombies! Like the graphic novels, the walking dead does not disappoint as a television series. My favorite show!

4292656,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I bought this due to the popularity of the show.  I'm a late adopter, I still have a Blackberry, and not the new one.  I bought the first two seasons in December but did not watch until this past weekend due to innappropriate material for small children.  I nearly spent the entire weekend locked in my bedroom watching this series.  I am not a fan of zombie movies, but the story and characters are well developed in this series.  There are a couple of twists that you see coming a mile away, but don't seem to mind because of how well its written.  Its the kind of TV show that will spur dinner conversations with your spouse on how you would survive the zombie apocalypse.",1363737600,,675,4.36

4292664,5,B0049P1ZZQ,The Walking Dead is one of the few series in my lifetime that I ever made sure to watch.  The last one for me was Seinfeld and to be able to download them to my Roku to catch up on when I do miss one is a great convenience.,1363478400,,223,3.5510204081632653

4292666,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Not sure why this was done, however when the PLAY ALL option is selected the episodes ARE in fact edited. When each episode is selected individually the episodes are NOT edited. I do not know why this was done as I feel it takes away from the season 1 release...Aside from that it is still a fantastic series and a decent release.",1363132800,,330,4.338709677419355

4292668,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This show by far is one of the greatest shows to hit TV. I love this show not just because of the zombies, this show is actually considered to be under the genre of drama. There is plenty of zombie killing but you also really get to know the characters and wonder what they are going to do next. The first season is great! You start your journey with Rick Grimes in the new zombie apocalypse. You follow him through some great situations with zombies and people. The last episode will definitely make you want to know what is going to happen next! If you have yet to watch this series I highly recommend it!",1363046400,2,607,4.28695652173913
4292669,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I really enjoyed the first season. I was totally new to The Walking Dead and am glad that I started.
The first season is kinda short but its really worth it.

Buy Season 1 and 2 on DVD from Amazon and catch up with instant video for season 3",1363046400,,241,3.9183673469387754
4292670,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"A very entertaining series despite my confusion of why don't the characters raid stores for more supplies such as food, weapons and ammo, and clothes? Also, if it were me, I'd dump the 1973 Wagoneer and drive a Range Rover or a Hummer! Haha!

Love that it is filmed in Atlanta",1363046400,2,276,4.411764705882353

4292673,2,B0049P1ZZQ,I watched episode 3 then watched it again with my wife. Amazon charged me twice. I looked through the help page as to where to challenge this..but good luck with that. I can leave a review!,1362960000,2,189,4.277777777777778
4292674,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I was kind of skeptical before I bought this but I heard so many positive things about it I decided to take a chance on it. And I'm glad I did. This is an awesome series. Great zombies and story line for that matter! Alot of breath taking moments. I will continue to buy these series as they come out! I can't wait for season 2....I've heard that Josh Stewart is in it which is even more incentive for me to buy it ;),1362960000,,417,3.9761904761904763
4292675,5,B0049P1ZZQ,Zombies definitely scare me and I like being scared. If you like being scared and the idea of a zombie apocalypse appeals to you then be sure to check this out. It really takes a couple of episodes to get to know all the characters but the show comes together pretty quickly after the second ep I think. The show also seems to parallel the comic book but not exactly- there are subtle differences. Lots of action too. And you never know who's gonna die and who's gonna live. They really keep you guessing since no one is really safe. Lots of bonus stuff on the dvd's- almost too much. I don't like seeing too much behind the scenes stuff b/c it takes away from the realness of the show. The scenery is gorgeous too since they really film in some of those small Southern towns in Georgia in and around Atlanta. The characters are so real- not at all laughable. It really makes you think about how profoundly life would change if a zombie apocalypse really occurred. This show is extremely violent and gory so beware of letting kids or even adults with jumpy hearts watch! If you like to be scared then this is a show for you.,1362873600,2,1124,4.357142857142857

4292677,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"Horribly boring.  The acting was the only thing that was half decent, but even it was mediocre.  The story line was non-existent (just another rehash of the same zombie apocalypse nonsense that was interesting the first time you saw it but painful the thousandths time.

4292679,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I live for the next episode of The Walking Dead. I am truly hooked and can't imagine this show is on AMC TV. This series is in the same calibre as a Big Budget Cinema Movie. The Roller Coaster Ride is a Blast!,1362873600,,209,3.883720930232558

4292710,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I did not want to get into AMC's The Walking Dead, because it is what a like to call, addictive television. I try to avoid shows like this, but I was at a friend house the other week and there were a group of people watching it, so I really didn't have a choice and I got sucked into it's grip. The reason I don't like to watch shows like this is because it's based on a book, which usually means, the show is amazing and very well written until they reach the end of the book and have to come up with new stuff on their own. At that point, the quality of the story quickly diminishes and the show either gets boring or goes way over the top. As I watched the first two seasons of The Walking Dead over the course of a couple weeks, I found that the same was true for it. The first season was an absolute delight and I hated the fact that it was only six episodes. The second season started out pretty good also, but that's when the book must have ended and things changed. This powerful, exciting show became extremely predictable, with every episode featuring about forty minutes of talking and five minutes of action. So, if I was so turned off by it at that point, why am I watching the new episodes right now? Addictive television! Now that I know the characters and their stories I want answers to the same four questions as everyone else. Who is fighting with who, who is having sex with who, how will the story end, and the big one, who lives and who dies. Similar to soap operas, shows like the Walking Dead, for the most part, aren't well written, are extremely predictable, and don't really develop much after the initial impact. I didn't see a single episode in the second or third season that I enjoyed as much as I did every episode from season 1. I am nevertheless invested in the show and what happens now, and to be honest it's not that it's a bad show. I really like Sarah Wayne Callies from Prison Break and Norman Reedus's character is the one guy who really evolved into someone who fascinates me. The action scenes, as well as the effects are terrific, and they do have a pretty talented cast. It's my hope that as it continues to gain popularity, that the writers turn to other sources, perhaps the author of the book or even some fan fiction for alternative ideas on how to keep things fresh and interesting, because right now, aside from the question of who lives and who dies, there isn't much there to attract new viewers to the show. If you like dark stories, horror, and end of the world type fiction, I'd give the show a try, but if you're a newbie whose thinking about getting into the Walking Dead, I warn you, the first season is amazing and will suck you in, but after that, as of yet, it hasn't gotten any better.",1361836800,2,2748,4.286538461538462
4292711,5,B0049P1ZZQ,this show is fantastic.  season 1 is still my favorite.....the latter ones get into charcter definition waaaaay too much .  season one will remain the best because the apoclypse is so new and hectic and scary and real. more zombies less people problems!,1361836800,,253,4.8604651162790695

The way they did the walkers in this series is unbelievable. They are so realistic and authentic that its just crazy how awesome they look. Before I bought the series I had also heard that Norman Reedus was in this show and I had already liked him from when he was in The Boondock Saints movies so that kept me waiting for when he was going to be in the episode and without a doubt he is my favorite character. If you want a good show to leave you on the edge of your seat with awesome characters and good action in pretty much every episode, this is the show for you.",1361750400,,987,4.040816326530612
4292714,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"This half baked soap opera with the occasional zombie tossed in has only been enjoyable because my teenage son & I take such pleasure in ripping it to bits. If you must buy it though, sticking to the 1st season is your best bet because after that the series sinks into an ever deepening quagmire of ludicrous & contrived plot lines that are probably too numerous to mention in an Amazon review.
Although, I would like to know how zombies manage to arrest the whole rotting meat drawback so they can go on & on & on like mobile hunks of Energizer bunny meat?
I would also like to know why, given the plot point that the reanimated part of the zombie's brain is the ""reptile brain"" of pure animal reflex, the zombies aren't humping what they're not eating?
Or, better yet, humping what they are eating?
Maybe that's a bit too disturbing for the kind of geeky pseudo hipster couch potato this show seems to appeal to....
Strangely enough, this has been the first zombiefest I've watched where I find myself consistently cheering for the zombies.

I stream Netflix for $7.99 monthly, and they are hands down the cheapest when it comes to watching shows. Seasons 1 & 2 of the Walking Dead are available. If you want season 3, then you have to stick with Amazon.

I am not a fan of zombie shows, but this show is INCREDIBLE. AMC is better than HBO, which I used to love their serials. The Walking Dead is cutting edge, and no one is safe. I think that in itself keeps the show fresh. Things are changing constantly, which as a viewer gives that sense of dread, of doom. There is no feeling of safety for anyone, which is scary. Other TV shows have their cast of characters and no matter what they encounter, you are assured they will make it out alive. You can have empathy, but there is no real mystery. Not so with the Walking Dead. For almost an hour each week, people are put through the paces of ""what if"" and how would I handle things? The characters are in a constant state of survival. There is not time to settle down and grow food. So they have to constantly look for what is left, as more and more has already been plundered. Each week we are made to live the dread with them. We are pushed to change with them, because their personalities are changing week to week as they deal with the nightmare they live in and try to survive.

I do not like slasher/blood and gore movies so for me that's not the attraction.  What captured me was the human interaction in extreme survival mode while trying to maintain human decency.  Of course, special effects are quality and the violence is necessary for the theme to be realistic.  Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, and Stephen Yeun are so REAL in their characters, you have to believe them.

4292772,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I have always thought the idea of zombies to be stupid. The concept was lame, impossible and cheesy at best. When my boyfriend ""made"" me watch zombie movies I did everything I could to hold back laughter. It was just that dumb, in my opinion.

Then one day this new television show began to air called The Walking Dead. The hype, to me, was just another zombiefest riding on a new generational obsession. Check back in with me in 15 more years when the next generation hypes it up again. Like waves on the beach, fads do come and go. Come back, go .. wash, rinse and repeat.

Then my Mom watched the show. I felt defeated. Outnumbered. I now had two people pressing the issue telling me to tune in. I didn't wanna .. and I didn't do it. Season One came and went. I don't know how it happened but one day during the long Summer break I gave in to my boyfriend's persistence. I sat down with him and watched one episode of the Season One dvd set I had bought him as a gift. Then another episode, then the third .. I realized that day there was something different about this zombie craze. But I still resisted!

Weeks went by and I did not pick up where we left off. Eventually though, I found myself flipping through cable channels at night or on the weekends and would see The Walking Dead reruns on. I would just keep it on there .. you know, for background noise. By the time season two came on I was hooked and had been highly anticipating the return of Rick and Shane for weeks.

I now watch every single episode the moment they come on. The first night of this most recent season my cable provider did not offer us AMC due to a contract dispute (yes, I was one of the helpless victims caught in the middle). I found myself hitting ""refresh"" every five seconds trying my best to get AMC's one-time free airing of The Walking Dead to load on their website for those of us who were with the ill reputed cable service provider. While I missed the first 20 minutes of that episode, I found myself laughing at my desperation. Of all things, I was freaking out over not getting to watch zombies.

By that following weekend, I canceled service with my cable provider and switched over to a competitor. The very next day I found out my former cable provider finally cut a deal with AMC and they got my zombies back. I didn't care, though. I was more than happy to go elsewhere to a provider that would not take away my zombie show due to their own financial issues. I cannot risk it .. not ever again!

As for The Walking Dead and what keeps me on the edge of my seat for more .. I cannot get enough of the characters, the story plots, the emotion. While the possibility of zombies can still be passionately debated (I still laugh at the thought) what took hold of me and jerked me right into the vortex of what can only be described as one of THE best television shows ever is the way these people become a part of your life. No, I'm not setting a spot at the dinner table for Rick (although i would love to!). All the important elements that make for amazingly wonderful television and entertainment is right here within this show.

For the first time since I was a kid I am excited to tune in and watch a show that is so worth my time and my love. It really doesn't get much better than this.",1360108800,,3291,4.239234449760765

4292781,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This is without a doubt one of the finest dramas I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  I say that as someone who doesn't care for horror flicks, and most especially not the zombie genre.  When a friend recommended this, I thought she was crazy and I delayed for months before finally giving it a try.  I wish I hadn't.  Once I started watching it I finished the first two seasons in a few days.

To me, the zombies are really a very small part of this show.  Like any good show, it is the writing, acting, and directing that make it amazing, not the subject matter.  But the premise provides an excellent breeding ground for all sorts of drama.  One of my favorite aspects of the show is the incredibly hard decisions that have to be made, and the show's writers do a good job of showing that right and wrong under these circumstances aren't nearly as clear-cut as you might think.

The show also very realistically portrays the fact that diversity is most certainly NOT strength.  With only a few survivors, the group is a wildly disparate one with people from all sorts of backgrounds.  They rarely agree on anything, and are in constant conflict.  And yet they manage to overcome diversity (for the most part) and pull together to face the common threat.

In order to put characters in agonizing scenarios, the setting needs to be extreme.  Lets face it, you can't get anymore extreme than Zombiepocalypse.

I really love the soundtrack, cinematography, realistic dialogue and emotionally-wrenching scenes in The Walking Dead.  I don't watch this show to see a crazy zombie kill (though it is a nice bonus) but rather to see how characters will evolve, survive or die.  This isn't Shakespeare but there is a surprising amount of depth and complexity in this show.  If you are at all curious, don't cheat yourself - check out this show.",1359331200,,742,4.888

The music was creepy,too. I was 6 years old when i saw it. Me,my brother,and my mom still talk about this movie. None of us can enter into,or pass by a cemetery without thinking about this film.

When I watch a series like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, the characters, writing, and story line are so good and feel so real that I cannot wait to start the next episode.  This is the opposite.  Each episode is worse than the one before it.  The writing is so bad and the characters actions seem so forced and contrived, that I find this nearly unwatchable.  The characters are all like cardboard and have no personality.  The african american woman in the group has about 2 lines the whole series.  The blonde girl just gives us lame ""worried"" faces, and the ""hill billy"" dude is so stereotyped that it is comical.  Even the main characters are lame, and their kid has the personality of a stuffed animal.  The zombies are also pathetic; just bopping around town on the streets.  You'd have to be blind and crippled to get caught by one.

So tell me, does the show get dramatically better in subsequent seasons?  After watching season 1, I am really baffled.  How can people rate this as a 5 star show?",1358726400,,1094,4.4646464646464645

First view episodes does a great job of pulling you in, after that some people complain the plot and story goes nowhere. I disagree because I enjoy the character development and silly distractions the survivors go through when surrounded by the walking dead.

4292854,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"I approached The Walking Dead extremely excited by its rave reviews amongst my friends. ""Oh, you have to see it!"", ""It's great!"" they chimed. I would ask why, but I'd get the rather terrible answer of, ""Oh, just watch it!""

As someone who generally enjoys a good round of zombies, I tried to think through why it could be so much more interesting to my friends than the typical zombie fair. I came to the conclusion that zombie films require so much time and energy to set up the backstory and tone that they have little left for the characters, leaving them as unfortunately shallow shells you don't care much about. While this is fine for a night of popcorn mashing, it doesn't leave a film as particularly memorable. However, given the episodic structure of a TV show, there's a lot of time to develop characters and make them into people you care about, making their interactions with zombies all the more enthralling.

With this in mind, I eventually bit the bullet and decided to give it a go. I purchased and streamed each episode separately, constantly skeptical as to whether or not I would finish the whole season or not. Seeing as I made it to the end, that's a good start I suppose (although the cheap cliffhanger endings made that significantly easier).

However, the journey was often times disappointing and frustrating. The show starts off the first few episodes with a stereotypically boring intro to set the peculiarities of this particular strain of zombies and characters. While the content of these episodes tended to be boring, they showed off a few emotional twists I've never seen before in a zombie film, making the show feel promising. Thus, I continued. As time moved on, however, I found that the characters remain shallow.

In general, it seems as if the writers are trying to write for a short-attention spanned audience - the only characters that get developed in interesting ways are the ones who disappear from the show at the end of the episode (zombified or otherwise). I really had no issues throwing my uninitiated friends in to watch a single episode of the season (for comparison's sake, try doing that with Lost). In my opinion, this single-episode mentality really wastes the episodic format and ruins my hopes for the character development in the show. Worse yet, most of the time, the characters are hardly likeable - I often celebrated to myself when the most boring characters were uprooted from the show.

That being said, as most zombie films, it was popcorn-munchingly decent. On the plus side, it still feels as though future seasons may hold potential - in fact, this season reminds me of the 20-minute exposition of a typical zombie movie: rather dull and boring (""Haven't these characters seen a zombie movie before? Why do I have to watch their ignorance again?""), but necessary for the fist-bump inducing follow up. By the end, the show's fat is trimmed and it seems perfect for a good roasting, provided the writers can get their act together.

I would recommend The Walking Dead, Season 1, to zombie lovers who don't really have much else to do at the moment.

(Summary)
Pros:
* Zombies
* Potential - episodic format has the ability to develop the characters in interesting ways
* Creates unique, although subtle, moments with zombies that plays with the emotional impact unlike other zombie films I've seen

Cons:
* Shallow, unlikeable characters
* Feels like the boring exposition of every zombie flick",1358208000,6,3460,4.83277027027027

4292871,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"Here is a classic case of a show feeling its way along from a great premise, and some interesting moments, to its much better groove (the succeeding season, seasons). Which could be said for so many other television shows. It usually takes quite a while to get the real creative juices going, doesn't it? Just to offer a few examples: how terrible were the first seasons of Star Trek: TNG, and the X-Files, respectively?

The Walking Dead, Season One, really only proves how there is usually a freshman jinx involved with classic television shows. The opening episode, for example, is hardly original: we saw it all before in 28 Days Later, didn't we? A guy wakes up in a hospital only to find the world has become a post-apocalyptic zombie hellscape while he's been away. Some neat twists on the theme do not take away from the fact that it is a stolen idea. From more than one place, it turns out: Stephen King wrote similar scenes as this in The Stand. Remember Stu Redman?

The rest of the season is not very surprising; various and sundry encounters with the undead and the presentation of survivors, none of which is particularly interesting. A low budget also meant a reliance on computer-generated graphics, so that the zombie deaths usually resemble something you could catch in a Resident Evil videogame.

We never see the most interesting part of the apocalpyse, which is the transition from one world to the next. It's just the next, and you have to imagine the rest. Disappointing. Or rather, it did not have to be disappointing, but it is, due to a lack of originality.

Today's audience is also accustomed to zombie horror, so that many of the scenes here, pivotal sequences in the episodes, just aren't very striking -- such as Rick's (the protagonist's) encounter with a hoard of undead in Atlanta. We've seen all of this stuff before, and so it is hardly worth a glance.

And the fact is, if this was all the show turned out to be about, it would be terrible. Instantly forgettable. Like a toned-down version of Night of the Living Dead. And there would certainly be no reason to keep turning it on week after week.

But it isn't just about zombies, that's the thing. It's about fully-developed, dramatically real characters inhabiting a zombie-world -- and that is new. Basically, what we have is the zombie universe treated for the first time since Romero's original film in the 60's as a serious stage on which the human condition can be played out.

We quickly realize that this is less about the scares and the killing, the dim lighting and the horror, than it is about the people involved in it. The interest arrives with the elucidation of character (which does not happen enough here to earn a higher rating from me, but which does happen).

Few of the scenes I liked involved zombies, actually. My favorite was the abandoned Dixon brother on the rooftop in Atlanta, his psychological struggle with God/fate/himself as he was dying of exposure. Very well done, a great performance based on the bedrock of a wonderful script. Romero never directed anything so beautiful. Other good ones involved Shane and Rick's emotionally divided son.

The stories show glimpses of what they will eventually become, once the writers become fully immersed in the characters. Not great, but very good in certain instances, especially the dialogue. Not a lot of trite lines here, no signs of inexperienced screenwriters ...

It's a very intelligent experience, overall, especially in the last few episodes. The lines given to the group's conscience, Dale, are frequently wonderful. Worth the price of admission. The over-arching themes of the series are introduced fairly well, and in a convincing manner. So again, it is not the zombie stuff that intrigues, but the deeper layers. For example, if there is no hope, if this is mankind's ""extinction event,"" then what, exactly, are these people plodding on for? And of course the survival of the body/versus the survival of the human soul thing (again embodied in many of Dale's dialogues).

I only give it three stars because the setting is given preference here, instead of the characters ... because it is still all being set up. The show gleams wonderfully when it is about the characters and the choices they face, the loves and hatreds they habor. But it sinks when focusing on the ""walkers."" Because again, we've seen all that before.

But the writers are clever. They understand that before the viewer can give a damn about who gets eaten or attacked by a zombie, he/she must first become involved in a character's plight ... and in a movie? You just don't have time to do that sort of thing. A few minutes backstory per character, and you better hope you succeed, or the whole movie fails.

Here they have time, and they take it. They build these characters brick by brick, and as convincingly as anything you'll find in even Emmy-award winning shows.

But again, all is set-up, a finding of the way, a searching through fog-enshrouded trees for a proper path. It's a good start, but I maintain that only in the next season do they really begin to get it right.

The final two episodes are disappointing, though intellectually stimulating. A CDC scientist, at the end of his tether, tries to murder the group, or encourage their mass suicide, however you choose to look at it. Either way, it's contrived. And almost certainly factually inaccurate, as far as the real CDC in Atlanta is concerned. It involves the destruction of the entire facility, when only the destruction of the labs (including any stores) would do. And the final blow-up is computer-generated nonsense, almost laughable in its look.",1358035200,4,5668,4.810894141829394

4292874,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"AMC's The Walking Dead, based on the graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, convincingly captured the imagination of the public in its inaugural season.  The degree of success of a series about a world where the undead prey on the living, probably came as a major surprise to some, as in recent years, there has been no shortage of ""zombie"" or ""outbreak"" films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;(2002), and it's radical sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later/dp/B000VDDWEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later</a>&nbsp;(2007).

There are many reasons why The Walking Dead achieved such popularity, starting with the high quality of the source material.  With the graphic novels sometimes serving as storyboards, the goal of the series' creative team, which includes Frank Darabont (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B003ZHR6RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist/dp/B001AR0D4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist</a>) and Gale Anne Hurd (The Terminator films), was to bring a fictional world to life.  Characterized by high production values, The Walking Dead features stunning visuals, creative camerawork, and top drawer special effects, with contributions from genre effects wizard, Greg Nicotero (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B001ECDVZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>, Planet Terror,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predators/dp/B0040YFR1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predators</a>).

It's quite remarkable, that a program which routinely features brutal gore and graphic violence worthy of a hard R rating, would be produced on a cable network like AMC.  The apparent lack of censor ship is amazing, as series does not shy away from showing zombies hacked to pieces, or splattered apart.

Set in Georgia, the story follows the aftermath of a viral outbreak that turns victims into mindless flesheaters, that behave much like George Romero's traditional zombies.  The story begins with Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) a law enforcement officer who is in the hospital when the outbreak occurs.  Upon waking from a coma, Grimes finds himself in a strange and terrible world where death is all around.

Frank Darabont does a fine job of directing, and the series contains some memorable visuals, such as Grimes entering Atlanta on a horse, and encountering zombies on the street.  While suspenseful and at times shockingly brutal, The Walking Dead is by no means perfect.  Leaving the town where he lives, Grimes wisely gathers a cache of weapons, but seems to neglect to take food and other basic supplies.  Headed for Atlanta in a truck, he runs out of gas.  While clearly not the most well-prepared guy, Grimes is truly blessed, as with help from a group of survivors, he escapes from the undead who have him trapped in an army tank, and then is miraculously reunited with his missing wife and son.

While much that occurs is based on the graphic novels, the season finale, an expedition to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, is an exception.  While this adventure seems to suffer from plot conveniences and timing issues, some key background information is provided, and the stage is set for ""life on the road"" in Season Two.

Much like a series like 24, being able to watch the episodes consecutively makes for a terrific viewing experience, where you can really become immersed into the world of The Walking Dead, at whatever pace you choose.  Some situations are ridiculous, or don't ring true, but the nature of this savage world is fairly consistent, with the high quality special effects contributing to the realism.  With a strong action component, character development occasionally suffers, but these are people that you can generally get behind and care about.

There are some common elements with The Walking Dead, however no previous program had achieved the phenomenal success of AMC's production, which is entering its fourth season.  The zombie genre remains popular, and with good quality films in rather short supply, a series like The Walking Dead is very much appreciated.

I have enjoyed this show because I hanker now and then for good zombie- and post-apocalypse stories.  And this show delivers pretty well on those counts.

That's why I tolerate the sometimes terrible writing.  Without giving away anything important, I'll give an example.  During one episode in one of the three seasons I've watched, there is a very small town of fifty or sixty survivors who have managed to set up a good perimeter to keep out the zombies and get back a semblance of half-decent living.  An old man in the community is about to die from cancer, and has volunteered for an experiment.  After he dies, he will be restrained and allowed to turn into a zombie (sort of an undead, human-flesh-eating ghoul).  Running the experiment is a person who seems to be sort of bookish and nerdy -- perhaps he was a technician or researcher of some sort before the apocalypse -- he will test the old-man-become-zombie to see if the zombie can remember anything from the old man's life.  They want to see if there is anything human left in the unconscious mind of the zombie. Okay, so, old man dies.  They put restraints on him.  The corpse turns to zombie, starts growling.  The researcher asks a question to the zombie. So far so good.  I have no problem with the plot so far.

Next, the zombie moves his hands in the restraints, tries to lift his mouth to bite the researcher.  The researcher now turns to the other person in the room and says -- ""We've got to take off the restraints!  We've paralyzed his mind!"" And quickly undoes the arm restraints.  (I won't give away what happens next, and it's not relevant to my point.)

I'm sorry, but do the writers really take their audience to be that stupid?  Or is it the writers who are stupid? Consider.  The bookish nerdy techie guy knows that if he is bitten, he will have to be quickly killed, because once bitten, you soon turn into a zombie raring to eat people alive.  The bookish nerdy techie knows very well how dangerous zombies are.  He knows how they behave.  The whole of life revolves around surviving in the face of zombies.  But suddenly, he gets the brilliant idea to demand that the restraints be taken off immediately, because he believes that will allow the zombie to better communicate.  Furthermore, the techie doesn't want to even think it over, or try to discuss it.  No, he rushes to remove the restraints, and not with a ten foot pole, but close enough so the zombie might be able to take a bite out of him.  The other person in the room tries to intervene and demand that the techie guy not remove the restraints, but techie guy just doesn't have even a minute to stop and consider whether removing the restraints is really a good idea.

Now, that is so far from believable it's actually annoying to watch.  Obviously the writers just wanted an excuse for something scary to happen.  I'm fine with scary, but not if it only happens through idiotic writing.  Can't the writers find a better way to get where they want to go?  One way the writers could have sort of saved the scene, perhaps:  if the second person in the room, observing the techie rushing to remove the restraints, responded in part by screaming in shock, ""Are you out of your mind?  Are you a total idiot?!!!""  Then if it turned out the techie guy indeed had a screw loose or was a moron, the scene would make some sense.

But the scene did not make sense, it was just stupid.  Now, imagine such unbelievable stupidities proliferating like the zombies in the show.  I realize that the whole premise of the show is strictly speaking unbelievable fantasy -- but good fiction often makes the unbelievable plausible -- that's part of the fun of it.  One chooses willfully to suspend one's disbelief, because the thing is well-enough done to enchant.  But it's hard to suspend one's disbelief if a story virtually shouts at you ""hey, look how idiotically unbelievable this writing is!""

I sometimes enjoy emotional or sentimental drama, so long as it's at least somewhat intelligent, but one reason I gave this show only three stars is because, at certain points -- I don't recall whether this started in the first season, or the second season, thankfully the third season does relatively little of this -- the characters get into the most annoyingly unbelievable -- especially given the whole zombie context -- pointlessly emotional conflict scenes that make no sense or make sense only by the primitive logic of bad writing.  This makes one start to revile some of the characters for their non-sensical emotions and behavior given the situation.  The conflicts tended to go on for a tortuously extended period.  The emptily intense dialogue, perhaps particularly between the main character and his wife, was sometimes almost impossible to endure, both tedious and provocatively stupid at once (at least in the second season).  I found myself hoping the wife would get eaten by a zombie.  I don't blame the actress.  The writers (and directors?) have so frequently invested her with false and idiotic emotions and intensity, to the extent that you can't look at her face anymore, because it so embodies the aspect of the show that is so annoyingly stupid.

But despite the sometimes terrible writing, this show is still definitely very much worth a gander if you like zombie-post-apocalypse stuff.  The fact that this show is fun despite the sometimes terrible writing is a testimony to the power of post-apocalyptic zombie mythology.",1357430400,3,5479,4.710830704521556

4292906,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I watched Season 1 and Season 2 on Netflix. This review is for both seasons and is posted on both. As a TV series, other than Friday Night Lights, I've never been so drawn into a world.

The main characters have distinct personalities.

The men:

Rick Grimes - The moral leader.
Glenn Rhee - Smart, stealthy, supporter of the team. He's accused of being weak at times but is the opposite.
Daryl Dixon - Loner. He's rough around the edges but inside has a good heart. They're in the south, so they needed a hard core redneck.
Shane Walsh - Bad ass cop, he's the one who you're never quite sure about. Friend, or foe?
Dale Horvath - The group's elder. His words of wisdom are often lost on the younger generation. Isn't that how it usually works?
Hershel Greene - Opinionated, but somewhat delusional, he thinks they're dealing with a virus for which a cure will soon be found.

The women:

Andrea - The strongest, yet at times, weakest, of the women. She contemplates suicide more than once but learns to protect herself.
Carol Peletier - The weakest of the women, she lets men abuse her, and seems clingy.
Lori Grimes - The unofficial ""First Lady"" of the group. She's at times mother, at other times confidant to the women, at other times supporter of the men.
Maggie Greene - Farm girl who falls for Glenn. She lives in Hershel's dream world until reality jolts her.

I've read a number of the 2-star reviews (as I never read the 1-star ones) and most of them focus on how ""we've seen this all before"" or the plot is ""contrived"" or ""people just don't act that way."" I'll address each of these cons for folks out there who might be interested but have been turned off by the negativity.

SPOILERS AHEAD

The beginning. A cop named Rick is shot. He's in a hospital. When he wakes up the world has fallen to chaos. It feels too familiar to 28 Days Later. But that's where the similarity ends. Rick comes across a father and son, who save him and tell him it's safe in Atlanta. That they will soon make their way there. So Rick decides if his wife and son are alive that's probably where they'd be. Atlanta, of course, is overrun. He hides in a tank where apparently the operators were also taken by the virus. Rick is saved by Glenn who watched him crawl in the tank. The group who Glenn is with outside the city happens to be the group whom Rick's wife is with; and she isn't alone. She's been getting down with his best friend Shane, who left him to die in the hospital.

Contrived? I'd say, yes, there are some coincidences that seem a bit far out, Rick's reunion with his wife the most egregious. It will depend on your point of view. I think when you start watching, you expect him to find his wife. If you think it shouldn't have happened, you'll think it was contrived, no matter what. Because in that situation it really has to be ""contrived."" This reunion is what drives the rest of Season 1, so if you can't suspend disbelief with regard to it, you will hate this series.

Why do they kill themselves out of nowhere? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what to say to this. Wouldn't you think about it in their situation? This is very real to human nature, in my opinion, and I didn't think characters ""did it out of nowhere."" They were probably all thinking about it at one time or another, only some were actually willing to do it.

Guns? Why didn't they have more guns? After all, why wouldn't that have been their first priority? With all the guns in the South surely their would be guns EVERYWHERE, falling from the sky, the naysayers pout. I say in a time of panic, humans shift to the most basic parts of the pyramid for survival. Food, Water, Clothing, Shelter. Guns would certainly be on the list, and these folks admitted they needed more guns, but I could understand how, in a time of panic, that might not have been as much a priority. Also, in the beginning, they didn't necessarily know their would be ""herds"" roaming. They were away from their town and far from the city, so they had a false sense of security.

Why do the characters keep doing dumb things? Admittedly, these excursions lead to chaos more often than not, but isn't that why we watch? Don't we watch or read these zombie dramas to see the group attacked? To see how they react to adversity? To watch the breakdown of humanity as we revert to our basic instincts? Rick has a good heart, and he DID grab guns from the station. When he was ambushed he left them in Atlanta. So naturally, his inclination is to retrieve the guns, while doing something good: saving a man he handcuffed to a bar. That is in-line with him as a character: analytical, pragmatic, but not always totally logical. This is in contrast to Shane, who at all the twists and turns believes they should be ruthless. The contrast is clear throughout, never so much as the end of Season 2.

END SPOILERS

The bottom line: if you enjoy the zombie genre, great acting, interesting characters, wacky situations, and heart-thumping tension, (and if you have Netflix or AMC on demand), I'd highly recommend throwing on the pilot. This is the type of series where the hook is obvious and if you aren't into it by then, you won't be. If you are like me, you're in for a very, very fun ride, and you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.

4292926,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"This is the must have season #1 that brings all the story line, character and context background to the series.  That being said, some of the Computer Graphics in season #1 is REALLY Cheesy; especailly the epsiode where the Centers for Disease Control blows up.  They'd have been better to work with scale models than the unrealistic CGI.  Also, the it seems while the producers go to great lengths to employ realsim, some episodes and takes are truely UNREALISTIC.  For example in the episode where Main Characters walk into the ""gang"" enclave to rescue theor asian buddy, and only after heated words do they all decide to ""cock their pump shotguns...""  HUH, really, You don't lock and load UNTIL you get inside the bad guys Lair!  Thats so UNREALISTIC.  And you have eough explosives to totall Destroy the ENTIRE BUILDING housing the Centers for Disease Control, yet you can crouch down 100 ft away in side your 1980's RV and never suffer any SHOCK concussion.  Ok, so the PHYSICS consultants were taking a break when that scene was shot.  I still enjoyed the story line.",1357171200,2,1073,4.756756756756757
4292927,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is a brilliant zombie mini-series that follows an unlikely group of people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. The writing on this show is very smart and I was pleasantly surprised on more then one occasion during the first three seasons. I won't ruin it for you but this is a show you must watch from the beginning. Don't cheat yourself out of a fun ride. I've already purchased seasons 1 and 2 for my personal collection and will buy season 3, once the full season ends. If you are a horror fan and like zombie flicks, you won't be disappointed. This is not a B-Rated flick, it's very good quality. I would not recommend this for young children as it is a zombie movie that has plenty of gore and guts in it.",1357171200,,732,4.350364963503649

The Walking Dead is an eye-opening thriller that makes you realize that the government's priority is to protect itself and not the individuals.  Only you can truly protect yourself.,1357084800,,356,4.786885245901639

This was our first Amazon Instant Video purcahse, and I will tell you I was very skeptical. I am very happy with how smoothly everything went, from activating it on the app for my Samsung TV, to the purchase online through that app.  We have good bandwith and got a great HD picture, even though the TV is connected by WiFi.  The operation of the app was simple and intuitive.

As far as the show - If you buy this, you will end up buying season 2.  This show hooks you quickly and keeps you going.  Not having watched it until we got this at a friends suggestion, I can imagine the agony at the end of each episode based on the continual cliff-hangers at the end.

4292946,5,B0049P1ZZQ,In the blu-ray. One person commented about the gut scene. I don't know what he is refuring to but the people did drag a body out of a alley and did smear the dead persons guts all over their body so the zombies would think they were dead. I have one comment. I never saw the show on AMC. I thought Zombies ONLY ate people? Not animals? Great Zombie show. Love it.,1356912000,,363,4.055555555555555
4292947,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"It's fantastic that Rick remains dedicated to his group. He could have so easily given up on Maggie and Glenn, but literally slipping into enemy territory and facing certain death wasn't enough to keep him or Daryl and Oscar away. He's done a good job proving his leadership ability and even giving Daryl some focus when the prospect of Merle came up.

That said, Rick is still stuck with some emotional issues. I had thought that it had been a quick fix after his phone revelation, but seeing Shane was not a good sign that things are back in order. It was a nice surprise I wasn't expecting, but I can't wait to see how long until Rick breaks again.

And did anyone think Shane looked like Wolverine with that haircut and beard?

I did enjoy the gun fight, although I though Glenn and Maggie's rescue seemed a little easily done. Yet, it was certainly interesting that the two sides really didn't get a chance to meet and spent more time anonymously apart and firing bullets.

It really makes me want to see a personal standoff between Rick and the Governor even more. Except I have a feeling that the Governor Rick will be forced to face down the road will be nothing short of pure evil.",1356912000,,1190,4.470046082949309

4292970,5,B0049P1ZZQ,We didn't see this show until the 3rd seasons started up. I borrowed my daughters first season dvd set and my husband and I sat down to watch it one weekend. We were hooked from the first show and finished the entire season within 2 days. I checked the store for season 2 and found that it was much cheaper on Amazon. So I ordered 1st and 2nd season. It arrived by the next weekend and again we sat watching a marathon of Walking Dead. I did have a problem with one of the disk in season 2. There was a couple of places that started jumping forward in a particular episode. At first I thought that it might be my Blue Ray player but my daughter borrowed it and said she had the same problem. Probably not Amazons fault.

4292976,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The opening episode ""Days Gone By"" sets the stage for the best zombie series to ever hit the small screen. The opening is an idea stolen from 28 Days Later, where the hero wakes after a Zombie Apocolypse devistates the world. In this case, it is deputy sherriff Rick Grimes, who learns of the fate of this family and friends throughout the first season.  The horse and tank scene is classic!  Excellent support from a fine supporting cast.  The final episode is explosive to say the least, with the CDC doctor sharing a secret with Rick the viewer does not learn about until the end of season two.  Highly recommended!",1356566400,,618,4.590909090909091

4292997,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"As much as I personally love the post cataclysm and zombie setting this series just isn't interesting enough to watch.  While most drama in this genre (like many others) is driven by contrived circumstances usually the narrative is engaging enough that this becomes less overt and almost unnoticeable. Sadly in the case of ""the Walking dead"" the simplistic and contrived plot points blend pointlessly and uninterestingly into one another and then are then sprinkled with absurdity and banality.  The story literally advances as you expect every step of the way, there is no interesting dialog, action, or interaction between characters, the environment, or even among story lines.  A character is presented, his role immediately identified, and his story arc predicted with near certainty.  It's not particularly entertaining to watch the uninspired characters, their inane behavior, or the 3rd grade dialog unfold when you already know the underwhelming conclusion.  Worse still, the band of characters are forgettable and essentially boring, Han Solo and Bobafet may be one dimensional but at least they're interesting.  Even Shrek had layers. Watching this show is an exercise in tedium, I kept waiting for it to get interesting, but that never happened.  I watched the whole first season and it seemed that at some point it might become interesting, plus it's well reviewed by people who clearly think it is interesting, but much like a side scroller you can solve with button mashing your time is likely better spent on another original series out there that is more then a few steps from terrible, or at least engaging.",1356393600,,1625,5.179389312977099

I will say that I forced myself to give this show a chance and quickly found myself asking, ""what happens next?""  Love the characters and how they work together to overcome their perceived fate.  I've never been so excited to see a zombie get its butt kicked!  You end up rooting for the characters, feeling relief when they prevail, and sadness when they perish.

We are looking forward to Season two.,1356048000,,274,4.5
4293029,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"This series is going to be perfect for sci-fi fans who have a knack for dystopian tales. This particular series, dealing with zombies, grips you from the very beginning of the first episode which takes place at the start of the disease's spread. Throughout the series, you'll dangle on cliffhangers and surely be tempted to watch it all at once, all episodes back-to-back. Characters are complex, intriguing and far from perfect. I would recommend giving this a shot. One episode will prove whether it's right for you or not.",1355961600,,525,4.910112359550562

4293035,5,B0049P1ZZQ,Alright so I am a 70's baby. This show in composes my love of horror and action. This is yet another show that is depicted from a  graphic novel. Which I have never read. Yet I have quickly become a die hard fan. This show is set in an apocalyptic type atmosphere with a some what realistic twist. You find your self wondering how you would survive if you were there and who would you trust. What would you do to keep your family alive.,1355961600,,436,4.129411764705883

4293037,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Got the GREATEST deal ever on this during the Lightning deals. Got me started on the season.
If you're interested in anything from the south, it will interest you. The ""zombie"" experience is amazing as well, but
usually not my thing. The writing, characters, and ""set"" (city of Atlanata for the first season), are the best parts!",1355961600,,329,4.7894736842105265
4293038,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"In my opinion The walking dead is one of the best series in years!
So, of course, I had to get it on DVD. Unfortunately there is no uncut version in Germany or even the UK.

So for any fan in Europe, of course you need a Region 1 DVD player:
I ordered it from the US, it arrived even before the estimated delivery date and even after paying the VAT it was still cheaper than buying it in Germany...

The series itself is just great, just see for yourself... definitely worth the money!",1355961600,,485,4.148936170212766

4293041,3,B0049P1ZZQ,Most of the plot came from 28 Days Later and a lot more of it doesn't make sense. It's fun to watch until the really poor dialogue gets to you. I bought the entire season before I watched any and I was fast fwding through lengthy emotional scenes that did  nothing for the plot right away. Maybe watch it if you cant find any other single show in the world to watch first.,1355875200,,372,4.095890410958904

4293053,5,B0049P1ZZQ,After hearing so many people praise this show and seeing random episodes on AMC I decided to take it upon myself to give it a shot.  Zombies always have interested me and this show definately fills that nitch.  The show starts more about survival in a chaotic world with how people thrive with flesh eating dead walking about but ends up being more about the horrors of how terrible humans can be.  Very well written and the actors are spectacular.  Would easily recommend to anyone and the digital content allow for mobile viewing in HD to catch up to season 3.,1355616000,,562,4.534653465346534
4293054,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"There isn't enough time for me to tell you how awesome The Walking Dead is. This is not just a Zombie show, it is a study on the human condition in a crisis. The Zombies are just the danger, this show is very much about a group of survivors trying to survive a cataclysmic event and maintain their humanity. While only 6 episodes, Season one will have you gripping the edge of your seat the entire time. Be forewarned, you will not survive buying this season without being compelled to buy the second and soon to be third seasons. Awesome Show.",1355616000,,544,4.396039603960396

4293074,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead Season one tells us and shows us what the world has become for these characters. As the show goes threw their first six shows they show how powerful the human spirit is and what it can go threw and survie.  The show mixes many elements together like drama between the actors as the storyline goes along.  How determine we can be to find answers to the questions we have about what is happening to us.  The show itself reminds me of the old style zombie movies, just with more depth and intensity to keep the show going for a long time in my viewpoint.  I think this is a great tv show and will be on for a long time because it mixes drama, sadness, anger, love, so forth between all the actors because they want to find out what is out there in this new world.  While they trust each other to protect one another as they travel along their journey.",1355097600,,865,4.218181818181818

The main problem is that it's so hollywoodized and clich in terms of emotions, acting, and plots.  It suffers from having very simple plots and nearly zero political or artistic relevance.  It just doesn't appeal to me as much as Game of Thrones, True Blood, Star Trek, and other series that seem to attract the best and brightest artists, designers, and writers by using fantasy as a means of addressing controversial issues from a metaphorical distance.",1354924800,,599,4.776699029126213

4293102,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Great show from great source material. If you're expecting ""simple"" horror (gross outs, scares, etc.) this really won't scratch the itch.

Both the comic book and the show are much more about the human toll of the collapse of civilization. The zombies certainly add a fun element but watching how the characters change as they are forced to do things they would never have done in the ""normal"" world is a big draw of the show.

Early in the days of the comics Kirkman talked about having a zombie movie that never has an ending - and watching the protagonist (Rick Grimes) become almost unrecognizable as the man he was when the story started.

The BluRay definitely looks better than the broadcast HD and the specials are OK.

If you like post-apocalyptic fiction where the people don't look clean and neat (looking at you, Revolution) give this a try.",1354492800,,853,4.704697986577181
4293103,5,B0049P1ZZQ,This series is so awesome. From minute one of episode one of season one I have been hooked. The DVD was delivered in it's original package and I have had no problems and have enjoyed watching.,1354406400,,192,4.361111111111111
4293104,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Great show if you're into the zombie genre and good enough to draw you in if you're not. The Walking Dead, however, is not exlcusively blood and gore (although it does a great job excelling on that field). My favorite aspect of the show is the intense inter-personal relationships and actions that the characters are forced into.
Entire first season on great quality Blu-Ray and I got it for $12.99 so I have 0 complaints",1354406400,,421,4.626666666666667
4293105,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I bought the bluray based on the Black Friday sale and the high ratings that the show received. I am glad that I made the purchase.  I thoroughly enjoyed the series.

The zombies makeup are extremely well done. There were definitely no corners cut here on the special effect budget. There is also an engaging storyline along the required shoot em ups that one expects from the genre. I can't wait to get season 2. Horror picture fans will not be disappointed and even the casual horror picture fans may find the series engaging. Very well done indeed.",1354320000,,551,4.612244897959184
4293106,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I watch very little television. This is one of the few shows worth watching. And it's about zombies! What more could you ask for? Well... there is that issue with zombie skulls being so thin....,1354320000,,194,4.571428571428571
4293107,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"My sister bugged me to watch this. I said, no way - I don't like gore. I don't like drama. But she bugged me, so I watched episode 1 of season 1. A week later I was through the whole season and getting started on season 2. Another week later, I devoured season three. So, yes, I hate to say it but my sister was right! This show is excellent! Great effects, great tension, some nice twists, complicated characters and very good acting!",1354233600,,435,4.253012048192771

4293109,5,B0049P1ZZQ,Heard good thins on this show and went out on a limb by purchasing the first season. I was hooked within 3 episodes and continued by buying the second season and the individual episodes that have aired in the 3rd season. Now that I'm caught up I just use my DVR.,1354233600,,262,4.1568627450980395
4293110,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"For starters, I'll say that I've followed the Walking Dead comic series prior to viewing the show, but it hasn't colored my feelings that much.

The first 4/6 episodes of this season are powerful, emotional, frightening and great.  I'm saying this in spite of the fact that many of the characters on the show are either wooden or unlikable.

The series begins with a bang (literally) and races along in a rush for survival, but slams on the break by episode 5 (of 6).

The production values on the show are film quality.  Things look great and feel real.  For the most part, the acting is good, but there are a few bad actors and they can unfortunately overpower scenes at times.

If you're up for a show that's a little disturbing (not scary, disturbing) that takes you for a ride, this can be a good show.  While I'm not head over heels for it, I know I'll come back for more in subsequent seasons.",1354233600,,900,4.412121212121212

I did not like horror zombie movies and things like that, but he persisted so I caught the first episode in a rerun and I loved it.  My husband and I are now both completely hooked on this show!  I must say you have to watch the seasons in order to understand all that has happened and what is happening.  I purchased season one and watched them all to catch up to season 2 then watched season 2 and now season 3 on AMC.  This show is more about relationships, and how you trust people.  It is much more than zombies, yes there are zombies and it is violent and graphic (very well done too) but it is more about survival.  It really makes you think, about a lot of things in life.

I attended the 8 PM Thursday (aka Black Friday sale) sale at my local Walmart just so I could get season one and a few other DVDS at a cheap price. I had to wiggle my way around a mob of shoppers to grab the last DVD set, which I paid just under ten dollars for.

It only took me two nights to go through the short season of six episodes. They were just as good as when I originally watched them. The show is one of the best written series on television and it keeps getting better with every episode.

Then to top it off, dish dropped AMC... so I turned to Amazon and was so very happy they were showing The Walking Dead the day after it shows on TV. Dish ended up putting AMC back on after the 3rd episode of the season aired and I ended my subscription to The Walking Dead but I can honestly say that the quality of the show was good (I used my google tv to log in to amazon and stream it onto my tv) and I will be using Amazon again to watch my shows when traveling or if dish pulls another stunt.",1353283200,,564,3.8706896551724137
4293161,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I order this and got it in the time frame I was given, I have yet to watch it, but it was brand new so I'm sure its in perfect shape!",1353283200,,133,3.3225806451612905
4293162,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Once again, I am adding my voice to already hundreds of reviews because it can't hurt the series or Amazon to have another avid fan rate it 5-stars. The Walking Dead isn't for everyone. I will start by warning you it is just about the most graphically gory show allowed on 1st tier cable. And if that gore was done for the sake of bringing in the teenage crowd, I would not watch it.

So, let me try to convince you that if that sort of thing is always your basis for not watching a show, then not only are you missing the point, but you are missing arguably the best show on TV (at least as good as Homeland and Sons of Anarchy). The blood and gore is a function of the reality the people left alive after the ""zombie virus"" has decimated society and must endure to stay alive. It's not a perfect show, and occasionally I see things writers do for plot's sake, but those moments are few.

When I first read that our hero, Rick Grimes is played by Andrew Lincoln who hales from London, England (just an aside, anybody else think between Canada, the UK, and Australia that the all -American actor is a thing of the past? ), I admit my jaw dropped. I am one of those who can honestly say I am an original fan. I have watched Dead weekly from the very first episode until last night's episode. Somewhere in the second season, I looked Rick up on Imbd and found out this great actor with that perfect Georgian drawl actually speaks with a fairly prissy English accent! (Which like most American women normally find quite sexy.) I cannot imagine what it must be like to be one of the actors on this set. All that to say Mr. Lincoln's portrayal of Rick is the standard all actors should aspire to. The cast is lengthy and in the first season changes out quite a bit. I'd like to name each one, but that would be ridiculously redundant on this thread.

If you haven't watched the series yet, and can suspend your normal reaction to the goriness of Dead - seriously - start with this season (1) and enjoy TV so good, the fare offered at the movie theaters has very rarely surpassed this one. I have to say that Season 1 was genius in how real it stayed with characters, surroundings, and story. In my opinion, society would devolve into a very messy thing under these circumstances. As one who likes an apocalyptic storyline, I also rarely find any of them to be particularly good or realistic. The Walking Dead ALWAYS keeps it real. With characters you fall in love with, expect to keep tissues handy throughout the season. BUY IT! And do buy the best viewing (blu-ray right now) version of it. Makes excellent Christmas presents for fans and NEWBIES who keep saying they'd like to watch it but are too busy. You can't go wrong (knowing you are buying for adults - I personally would not let anyone under the age of 16 watch this - extreme adult content). I know money is tight for many people these days, and I would not push a show that wasn't truly top-notch for that reason. This one is already highly popular with (I hope) many seasons to come. Just an addendum here - the TV series and first season was Frank Darabount's baby. He completely stepped out at the end of season 1. But if you want to know the effect that had on Season 2 and most way through 3 - you'll have to read my reviews of those!  Season 1 - best of the best. Enjoy!",1353283200,,3334,4.312599681020734
4293163,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Well, I'm hooked.  Everyone said I'd like this and I finally gave in and ordered the Blu-Ray for Season 1.  I've already ordered Season 2 and can't wait for Season 3 to come out.  It's not about the zombies, and yet it is.

4293164,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"When my friend recommended this to me I was very weary of it because I am not into zombies or science fiction but I said that about vampires but I gave them a shot and I love them! So I gave the zombies a shot and good thing I did because it is one of my favorite shows of all time!!!!!
I'm still not a fan of science fiction but the walking dead has a good enough plot and story to make it great!!!!! My fianc is not into scary movies or any movies that are gross or bloody at all but she loves this show too!! If she can love it anyone can.
The only criticism I have about the first season is that it's only 6 episodes but they are all great!!
At least they didn't put in filler to make a normal full season.
If you are like me and my fianc and don't really like science fiction or blood and guts, give this show a chance because it has a great story to make up for the blood.
If you are on the fence about this series then take a chance like I did and you will be very very surprised and happy you did!!!!!

4293165,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"You will not find a more well written and disgusting show/movie anywhere on this planet than The Walking Dead.  Some episodes are a little slow, but they add to the story line as a whole.  Everyone should watch this show. The violence is a little disturbing at times.  Like watching a zombie get his head smashed in or chopped in half, but if you can stomach that type of thing then you will not find a better show on tv. My wife doesnt enjoy that type of violence and I often find her closing her eyes or looking away, but she can't get enough of this show either.  Also, I should add that this show is way more than just zombies getting splattered all over the place.  It's a story of humanity, relationships during trials, and how major conflicts can bring society together and tear them apart at the same time.  Total strangers,doctors, convicts, police, racist rednecks, elderly, children, etc... all working together in a small group with one common goal...survive.",1353024000,,971,4.649122807017544

4293169,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I have researched a bit looking up why the minority reviewers here gave The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season the lowest rating--1 star. What stood out to me were reasons of poor acting and being very predictable. I have yet to hint any poor acting by the actors and it is not really predictable from where I stand. The acting is quite superb and this is not an understatement; the actors are not the typical soap opera actors on afternoon TV. They each have that little something that evolves into a huge flow of depth expressed in dialogue and emotion. I keep an open mind when I watch each episode to the acting and to say it is a joke, not funny. But to each his own.

As to my own review of the first season, it is just spectacular. I am a fan of zombies. I enjoy a movie depicting endless zombies furnished with a small group of survivors trying to overcome their odds to stay alive. This fits the description of The Walking Dead yet not in its entirety. As opposed to many movies in the typical zombie apocalypse plot, this series is very unique in that it heavily makes you think and critique every character and their actions. The relationships between them interacts so vividly I dare to say The Walking Dead is not so much about zombies and blasting them to smithereens with shotguns, revolvers and the all-so silent melee weapons like a baseball bat or sword than it is the love-hate and personal demons circulating about. This field is not explored much by the zombie-genre and it has always been missing until now.

Speaking of characters, the love-hate factor is evident right from the beginning. The same feelings will not always be there as you will change due to the fact character development is literally on steroids here. It is almost like a biography of every one packed into a series.

In summary, the action is all there just like any other zombie movie you would expect. What clearly makes the series stand out from the rest  is the portrayal of how and what the word humanity means.

What does humanity mean?

How do you balance between humanity and the will to survive?

Is humanity relevant even in this day?

Or is humanity obsolete?

Humanity has never been more subjective than it is now.

I am a late-comer since initially I was not interested about The Walking Dead. I think it is because I do not have cable, believe it or not, nor do I own any other series on DVD. True, I had heard about it before with all the praises. I bought the first and second season just recently out of curiosity [ bored at shows featuring now on regular TV ] and the praises were all true. I am going to get the third season as soon as possible and have a good feeling I will re-watch it again and again.

I also would like to note: Andrew Lincoln has that Wolverine persona in him from my observation.

Truth is the acting is bad, porn quality bad, in-fact their are times when you'll catch yourself subconsciously wondering why the Cinemax music hasn't started up, or why the actors still have their clothes on.
Regardless, the makeup is awesome and if you can live with bad acting then go for it. Their are only six episodes in the first season.

4293184,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"To put it diplomatically, ""The Walking Dead"" is a modern adaptation of John Wyndham's ""Day of the Triffids.""  In fact, the first episode of ""The Walking Dead"" is a blatant theft of the first chapter of John Wyndham's classic:  Both protagonists suffer an injury that permits them to escape the apocalypse, wake up in a hospital bed, know that something is wrong because the nurse won't come and the clock has stopped, and walk into the light of a world in ashes.  There are in fact so many similarities that ""The Walking Dead"" seems to any reader who's had the pleasure of reading ""Day of the Triffids"" silly and derivative.

I also find the acting unbearably melodramatic.  A good director with empathy would have understood that emotional force and reality would have been created if he had his actors understate and under-act their emotional states.  First, that would have been the natural human response -- when faced with danger and intense shock, humans naturally suppress their emotional reactions, thus giving them to analyze the situation and come up with survival strategies.  Second, understatement would have shifted the emotional burden to the audience, making ""The Walking Dead"" a much more frightening experience.

I think the unfortunate explanation for the enduring popularity of ""The Walking Dead"" is that it is a silly and derivative television show.  It is a formulaic recollection of popular culture, television show, and movies that people were fond of once.  ""The Walking Dead"" is a testament to the triumph of cliche and nostalgia, and the death of creativity and originality.",1351900800,3,1601,5.076335877862595

I don't think I have ever felt so much for the characters. It is a show that you love some of the characters and hate the other ones so bad you hope something happens to them.

It is very brutal and the show does an amazing job at realism, the story is wrapped around something that ""could"" happen in real life in a way. It just feels so real.

The characters NEVER do things real people would do. They do stupid things. They spend most of their time talking about their personal problems instead of focusing on survival and there are too many ""gimme a break"" moments. There are moments of brilliance and real terror, and some things are shown that are great. But really -- does ANYONE think that in Georgia it would be difficult for people to find an unlimited supply of guns and ammo? There are scenes of abandoned military vehicles and zombie soldiers everywhere yet all of their guns, ammo, grenades and so on somehow have vanished. Not a single survivor seems to have a military weapon. In addition, in a world where there a billions of dead people, the best these morons can do is continue to drive around in an ancient RV that conveniently breaks down at the most inopportune moments? Gimme a break. This goes on and on and on. The survivors struggle more over their pitiful bed-wetting problems than about the seemingly unlimited number of zombies who only seem to show up at the perfect moments to send the little survivor-ants scurrying around. Seriously. The writers do not give the viewer any credit for intelligence or imagination. If you're going to have a zombie series, at least have the characters do what REAL people would do, not what some writer who needs to move the plot has to FORCE them to do.",1351209600,6,1504,4.744274809160306

It is among my favorite shows, if not #1. (Along with Breaking Bad and American Horror Story). Season 1 contains doesn't quite fulfill my need of zombie-intake, but I believe that the emotional connection is what makes it a truly remarkable show.  Every time a character is alone, you worry something is going to happen to them.  This is because of the show's success in luring you closer and closer to each character.  I could rant on and on about the exceptional aspects of this show, but I believe it'd be best for YOU to be the judge.  If you are into zombies, and dramas, then the Walking Dead is DEFINITELY for you.  You will not regret it, I promise you that.  The only negative feature I could think of is the lack of a good CGI, but the unique zombie-kills make up for it.

The product itself (3-Disc Special Edition) has a decent design.  It opens up to a cartoon drawing of the characters alongside a painting of the iconic zombie, and pictures of zombies on the discs. There are some webisodes (that you can watch for free online) and a few commentaries featured on the special edition disc, but nothing that makes this a truly essential buy.  It is a must-have for hardcore Walking Dead lovers, but if you ONLY like the show, then I suggest buying the regular blu-ray edition. The only complaint I have is that the product shipped with a crack on the blu-ray case, but that is reasonably irrelevant to future purchasers as it is particular to me.

A successful TV show should do two things consistently:

1) Develop likeable characters, and
2) Present a strong plot.

No complaints on the characters; there are enough quirky personalities there to work with.  Unfortunately, blood and guts and severed limbs have taken the place of a decent plot, and the increasingly farcical appearance of moaning, slavering idiots rapidly devolves from creepy to funny to just plain boring.  Every decent director should know that an unseen (or rarely glimpsed) movie monster is much scarier than one that's constantly in your face.  Yet what do we have?  Herds and herds of zombies shambling around in every episode, boring the audience to tears.

With all due respect to the long-standing cinematic zombie tradition, that just sucks.",1350691200,5,1164,5.165775401069519
4293201,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"I really want to like this, but it's just like '28 Days' mixed with others, but stretched longer.  The most characters aren't really convincing nor some of the logics in behaviors/plots.",1350518400,,186,5.0
4293202,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"A MUST for everyone that wants to know how life can be when the world gets turned upside-down!  Though unlikely that the dead will ever rise up and walk again, this series gives us an intense look at how life will be post-apocalypse!  B.C., Mayfield Ohio",1350518400,,254,4.5
4293203,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"While the 28 days later opening hospital ripoff was disappointing, overall The Walking Dead is a dandy zombie show. The zombies are scary, gruesome, and a little tragic. I really liked that they were somewhat sympathetic and pitiable, with just a touch of confused humanity--as well as horrifying & terrifying, especially in a mob.

The human characters are mostly complex & interesting, and not complete idiots (stupid decisions are an infuriating monster movie convention & while some bad choices are necessary for drama, you still want it to be somewhat believable). The non-zombie dynamics & drama heighten the stakes on the zombie action. And the overall storyline is both engaging and believable in the context of the story. I still haven't seen the last two seasons, but i'm psyched season 2's on netflix so i can see what happens next!",1350432000,,843,5.021428571428571
4293204,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Good:
This is an excellent series, a must watch. Even if you are not into zombie flicks. It may sound odd to some, but the personality story lines reminds me of Twelve Angry Men.

The Bad:
Normally I rip my own Blu-rays but I figured I'd give the digital download a shot since Amazon's MP3 store has been so good in regards to the digital market. Big mistake. I have my library cataloged using a Plex server. I downloaded these only to discover that they are DRM'd so that if you try to access them via a personal media server it crashes the server and client applications. This is lame and should be disclosed more readily; I'm sure if you read the fine print some where along the line it'll say as much.

So bottom line is if you are a media junkie just buy the Blu-Ray hard copy and rip it. Commercial digital video downloads, even on Amazon, are still a hassle in many ways which is unfortunate.",1350432000,3,903,4.305882352941176

4293208,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was skeptical at first to watch a 'zombie' TV series but the plot and acting caught my attention from the start.  The first episode had the flavor of an old flick titled 'Day of the Triffids', which I, and I'm sure many other Baby Boomers will agree, enjoyed.  The story line proceeds smoothly (with some bumps) throughout.  One gets used to smashed skulls, brains and blood very quickly.  The make-up and special effects are supurb.  I had to buy the second season (which I never do) to see where it's all going.  Now I'm dvr-ing the third seasoning.  Hooked I am. Worthy entertainment.",1350172800,2,589,4.605769230769231

If you don't like zombie related movies/shows, then you might still like it.  This is a very well written series.  The character development is well done and the acting is top notch.

Battling zombies, while it is part of the show, is more of the side theme.  The show deals more with the interplay of the cast and how they struggle to survive.

Season 1 starts in normal time (i.e. pre-zombie).  Then, the main character awakens to find himself alone and trying to determine what has happened.  This is no cheesy Syfy channel movie.  This is a well done series with a strong cast that takes surprising turn after turn.

Some questions are answered during this season.  But, many are left and carried over to next year.",1349913600,,781,4.546762589928058

4293214,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I watched the first season of ""The Walking Dead"" on Netflix, having heard and read many good reviews of the program.  While not an aficionado of the Zombie motif in general, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys good drama, who appreciates well written plots and story telling.  After renting these, I felt that I would enjoy watching each episode multiple times, as there is enough character development and plot twist to make this a worthwhile purchase.  Other reviews will take up the story line (survivors of a deadly zombie virus) and there are some wonderful points made throughout them, if you are curious or not sure about this series, please read through them and take a chance.

4293220,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is about the zombie apocalypse, which has been done many times before. I am not a fan of the countless zombie movies that are made year after year, but this show is a revelation. While it has its share of blood, guts and gore, the main theme of the show is survival in a world that bears no resemblance to the one before. A group of varied people work together to survive against a common enemy and discover that survival of the fittest is a fact.

Rick Grimes wakes up from a coma after being shot in the line of duty to discover that there is no one alive in the hospital besides himself. There are bodies in the hallway and a room marked ""dead inside"" in blood. He finds a dismembered body on the side of the road, bones sticking out, a gruesome sight, but it is moving and trying to come for him. When he realizes what has happened and what he is facing, his only hope is survival, and his mission is to find his wife and son.

This short six episode season is a teaser for what is to come, an exciting and disturbing show that strips human nature down to its barest instincts.",1348272000,2,1098,4.199052132701421

This is a show that can be appreciated by all, whether they like zombie shows/movies or not.

4293224,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love this show and would like to see it broadcasted forever . As Long as the dead are biting, this show will be a hit forever. In the beginning, I thought the Main character, the Cop, was a wimp . It took a while for him to grow up and realize he must act like a man . One weakness in the show is the Black male actor., who is big and strong, yet they didn't give him a decent part to play in the group and they seem to treat him as an invisible person who doesn't need to be with them. They made him a buffoon, clumsy and wimpy. At least they didn't kill him early in the movie as most movies do with Blacks male actors, unless they are well known, like Denzel Washington . Now I know there had to be a lot more people of color who would survive  a disaster because they make up 80% of the worlds population but the writers only include 3 people of color with one killed early on. . Why? I don't know. Maybe in another hundred years , people of color( Blacks, Asians, Latinos, Native Americans  ), will be seen as an equal in this country and will be more represented in movies of this nature, or any movie in this country .",1347667200,,1127,3.982300884955752

It was not the usual blood, gore, and screams zombie fest.  While it does have its share of that, it also turns out to be first & foremost, a well-told story about very human characters, with all their failings & heroism, showing both the good & the bad in them.  And it is dealt with in a realistic fashion, with the characters making decisions that let them survive, or making wrong decisions that get them killed, without any miraculous ""saves"" that we don't get in real life.  It is on-the-edge of your seat suspenseful, keeps me coming back & wanting more.  Can't wait for the new seasons!

Everyone who is casted feels like the character created, from the comic or not, was written for their part.  I won't bore you with the details of every single character, but I will say you will have some opinion or feeling for everyone.  No one is just a bump on the log, just joining the ride.

4293233,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is a television show on AMC about a group of strangers banding together for survival after the world experiences the Zombie Apocalypse. In this horrific drama we follow the stories of Rick Grimes, a sheriff's deputy who always trusts his gut even when it's wrong, his errant wife, Lori, and their over-eager son, Carl. We also follow Rick's backstabbing best friend, Shane, a wiz-kid, Glenn, a whining desperate woman named Andrea, Daryl, the good ole country boy, T-Dog, the strong, silent man of the group, Carol and her daughter, Sofia, and Dale, the constant lookout.
 This television series is based on the comic book also named, The Walking Dead. This monthly black-and-white comic from Image Comics was first issued in 2003 by writer Robert Kirkman, who has also written Invincible for Image Comics as well as Ultimate X-Men and Marvel Zombies for Marvel Comics, and artist Tony Moore, who has illustrated Fear Agent and The Exterminators for Image Comics. The Walking Dead was awarded Best Continuing Series at The Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards in 2010, the same year AMC adapted the series to the hit TV drama it is today.
 The story mainly takes place in Atlanta, Georgia, and the countryside surrounding the city as the group of survivors fight against the hordes of zombies also known as the ""walkers."" Although, the show is about the Zombie Apocalypse, the bulk of the story is based around the relationships and interactions of the people left alive still struggling day to day.
 In my opinion, that is the best part of the show. This is not your stereotypical zombie/survivor story. Yes, the ""walkers"" are around every turn. Yes, I personally get way too involved in the story and become that person that everyone hates who yells at the screen, but only because the show does focus more on the characters and you become attached.
 Although this show is above most of the other zombie stories, it could be improved. I hate that so many people die. Like I said earlier, you get very attached. Yes, I understand that this is probably how it would be if this were to ever actually happen to the world, people dying every other minute would be something you would have to get used to. I still don't like it.
 I would recommend this show to anyone who loves drama, can handle quite a bit of gore, and wants to better his or her chances of surviving an apocalypse. This show is not meant for someone who gets easily queasy or nauseous. I personally love all the gore and drama.
 Someone who loves this show might also like the films Zombieland or Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. There have been a ton of movies based off of the comic book genre lately, everything from new Batman movies to Brain eating zombies. The comic book/film industry crossover is only becoming more popular and in my opinion on the up and up.",1346976000,2,2845,4.725806451612903

In this we get to see the character's foibles. How they deal with them, with each other and with the...walking dead. We can feel for them and with them. I'm looking forward to the next season. I hope it carries on in the same direction. Some shows start out strong and then fall short of expectations. Lets see what happen with this one. All in all, a good tv series. The only real fault I have with the series is the stupidity that prevails among some of the characters, just like in real life.

4293253,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I'd always wondered when TV would get around to putting on a show about zombies. Heck, we have or had TV shows on everything from vampires(True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, Moonlight) to werewolves(Teen Wolf) to aliens invading earth(V, Fallen Skies).

The Walking Dead being the biggest hit of the 2010 television season might not be too far off, to be honest.

Based on the acclaimed graphic novel by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead follows police officer Rick Grimes who wakes up from a coma after being shot to find that the world he once knew no longer exists. In its' place, a zombie epidemic of worldly proportions. His wife and son are missing so he hits the road to look for them. Heading to Atlanta where, literally, all the survivors are heading; Rick finds a small group of people who struggle to survive as zombies face them at each and every turn.  That, my friends, is where the saga of The Walking Dead begins.

If you're thinking that this show is like all the zombie movies you've ever watched, well- it isn't. What makes this show shine is how it deals with the humanity of this global epidemic. An example of this is how Rick, in one scene, goes back to put the Bicycle zombie woman out of her misery and apologizes to her that what happend to her happend & that he has to do what he has to do to end her suffering. Some reviewers out there seem to think that the show blows it out of proportion and make a big deal out of the emotional things. Personally, I think that is what sets this apart from all the other zombie stories out there. It gives a more realistic approach to dealing with a situation like that. I mean, ask yourself this..Would you not feel remorse for having to put someone out of their misery of being turned into something such as that?

Make no mistake; there's plenty of blood, guts & everything else that makes zombie films so great..as well. It is a zombie program after all. So, for those of you that are in it for that, the show has that too.

I suggest this show to all fans of the genre and even those who aren't. It's a really great program.",1344988800,,2091,4.390180878552972
4293254,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"What else can really be said that already hasn't been?

TWD, put simply, is by far one of the best episode shows ever put on screen.

the acting
the camera work
the zombies!
the storylines
the zombies!

The Walking Dead is gold medal material.

In my estimation, there's little that can be done to improve on it.
We should all just be glad the makers of this thing made it all happen.

I'll be putting in my order here on Amazon.com in the next few days for TWD season2.

4293269,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"5 stars over all ,
 I was not a zombie guy before this movie , This is not just a horror movie like night of the living dead , it has that ,, but its also a science fiction movie,With VERY HEAVY DRAMA overtones,..
  Top shelf stuff , This is one of those shows that makes life worth the effort , That's how good it is.
 Only other made for tv series i can think of with the pure entertainment value is Deadwood . It is for nearly the same audience ,Mainly Male ages 15 - 150 . and many Women will love it also .
Its a visual carnival ,The premise is pretty basic, Zombie apocalypse,But plausible.
Season 1 is setting things up , It will be even better for you if you are familiar with the comic series , as you will see the characters you already know take life . You won't be disappointed ..
  For people not familiar it is an introduction to the story and characters.
For extremely discerning acting enthusiasts, It might come off a little over acted or underacted in places ,Some character choices may seem illogical .
 Don't over think it, Just watch. There is a reason.  ,.. Because season two will bring a lot of that together.

 Season two----The whole story is a fuse to the explosion that will take place in 2 and nothing needs to be missed up to this point .It is a masterful work of art,There is no other way of saying it . It has every single element that makes for a good story /movie , all well placed ,and executed with mastery .
 There is no overuse of vulgarity like in Deadwood , It is present , but isn't used for effect , Just when necessary,even then its not the type that makes you cringe. They seem to have kept in mind that kids would be watching this, I cannot recall any nudity offhand.
 That said , This is a violent movie and how . I began hating the interludes between the zombie attacks because the situations they have to fight themselves out of are so entertaining , But as season two progressed those human interactions began to take shape .and take the spotlight.
  This is one of the few that will withstand re-watching a few times over the years,  therefore i recommend buying not renting , Set some time aside and enjoy it but beware of watching the entire thing in one night , savor it .Or you will be like me wishing they would HURRY THE HECK up with season three!!. Go to AMC website and learn a bit more . And if you like this , and are an adult .... you'll probably like Deadwood also .",1340928000,2,2428,4.191397849462366

I am well aware that this series is based off of a comic book collection which is also available on Amazon.com, but never having really been into comic books myself, this show was just what was needed to spark my interest. I have already pre-ordered all of Season 2, and Season 3 will continue in October 2012 following a teaser weekend in July 2012. This isn't a series just about zombies. There is alot of blood and realism to what life might be like if there were a zombie apocalypse, and the various cast members represent real life people in todays world. The makeup and effects can't be beat, and even with all the blood and the fear of zombies, this series actually has a storyline which makes the horror much easier to tolerate for people who don't watch horror/zombie flicks because of the surprise fear factor. This is a must see series!!!!",1340150400,,934,4.5325443786982245
4293274,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I usually resist getting involved in watching series because your life revolves around being home to watch them. With DVD recording systems and DVRs, it is much easier to watch shows on demand. AMC had a marathon on Thanksgiving weekend (2011) and ran all of The Walking Dead ending with the mid-season finale.  I was hooked!  I ordered the complete first season that week.  Love the show!  The conflicts between characters (both living and dead) makes this show great.  Both fortunately and unfortunately, I bought the ultimate edition (with bicycle girl on the cover) while I was visiting my family in Fort Worth, thinking that I would get a better, more expanded experience with the ""dead.""  It was great.  There is more bonus materials that added more ""meat"" to the show (the good part).  The bad part was the quirk I found on my copy when I tried to watch all episodes in order. The scene with the ""guts"" was deleted! When I watched it again episode by episode, the scene miraclously appeared. Creation of super-expanded versions of the same shows or movies are a common complaint many people have with the company Anchor Bay (distributors of these DVDs). Only ice cream cones should be double dipped (hint: Anchor Bay). Lazy people like me don't like having to hit the play button more than once (LOL).  The ""walker autopy"" was a crucial segment to that story line and Anchor Bay was to blame for ""butchering"" that episode. A real let down for die-hard fans of the genre. Another thing I found strange was the commentary track with Robert Kirkman and Emma Bell on episode 104 (Vatos).  Kirkman mentioned a conflict with T-Dog actor Irone Singleton.  I'm not sure if the altercation was verbal or physical but judging by how little screen time T-Dog got in Season Two, I got the impression that the conflict wasn't truly resolved.  Many people on the Twitter buzz who have watched Season Two have complained on AMC's website that T-Dog's character has had little if no screen time with one maybe two lines every other episode.  Some have relagated him to ""token status.""  I wonder if it had anything to do with the conflict.  The character (with beefy actor Irone Singleton) could be written as more of asset to the Grimes Gang.  A real missed opportunity.",1339459200,,2261,4.744245524296675
4293275,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"C grade.

Just OK basic cable show with a few too many unbelievable plot holes and cliched zombie situations. Good if you're bored and just want to plop down and turn off your brain, you know be a zombie.

1. A police officer or any other intelligent person(SOME PO's are intelligent) would have the basic logic that if millions of former humans are now rabid killer zombies then DON'T go to where there WERE large amounts of people clustered together i.e. cities. That's obviously where most zombies will be. DUH! I can see the logic of staying NEAR cities for their large stocks of non perishable food and other items but to march into a city is just beyond the pale. Lazy contrived story writing, ugh!

2. Cliched zombie survivor story. In almost every zombie story there are a group of survivors who are bullied by one or two angry males, almost always southern white males. Geez could these writers be any more typical than the countless entertainment workers I encounter here in Los Angeles. Believe me they are a tribe with their conformist PC ways and views that are easy to spot in mass market entertainment. Most of us don't even know that much and how much our views are shaped by these people. The clearest illustration is the current metro based Democratic party.

3. Annoying product placement. Oh that Dodge Charger scene was so obnoxious, now if fuel was limited and you didn't want to get in a car crash no matter what you would not go tearing full speed anywhere, but they have to get more and more revenue from both the paying audience and commercials AND in show placement, ugh. Not to mention the silly CDC part, that too would be the last place to go because EVERYONE else would go there too.

4. Annoying PC character balancing so everyone can relate! Plenty of feel good revenge scenes, black man leaving racist angry white man behind to be eaten, everyone is ""god"" fearing appropriate level of morality, PC kindness, abused wife does the final killing of violent husband turned zombie, etc. etc. The hospital for the elderly is protected by our friendly Latino gang, very silly and contrived. In an apocalypse survival situation none of this would happen, we'd go back to survival of the strongest period. You can barely walk through a dept. store without feeling the anger/alienation even now.

5. Plot holes. How could a character chained up suddenly out of nowhere find a hacksaw? Why would he use it on his hand rather than on the handcuffs? This is just silly. The tanks in the show would have had blood/body parts all over them including all of the cars, etc. They were clean as new here. Almost everything is burned out, why weren't the zombies also burned dead with the flames? The writers do so much to just string along a story in so many situations.

Now granted I am an engineer so I can see so much more wrong with the logic and realism than most but come on!

Zombies would be easy to immobilize in reality with our mechanized technology and number of technically educated people. You don't need to waste bullets firing on something that is just crawling along like in one scene. Simply mounting saws on the sides of a moving vehicle would cut their legs off effectively killing them or using airplanes to drop acid to burn them up, if they die from starvation then it would only be a matter of time anyways if they only eat flesh. Just run them over with a truck or car or tank, etc etc.

 Heck set the whole city on fire or herd them into an enclosed fire proof place to get rid of them, duh! Herding them into a slaughtering plant or other ambush point and putting a heated wire at the neck level or leg level would take care of it too, etc. etc etc. Contrived and idiotic writing is what you get with the majority of advertising based shows though.

From what I'm reading Season 2 is not as good as season 1, wow I'll skip this series here and now.",1339113600,2,3891,4.512784090909091

Ok first thing about the DVD is it upscales nicely assuming you have a legitimate copy and not one of those fancy fakes, I had to purchase mine elsewhere due to all the fakes that are being sold online I wanted a genuine studio released DVD because the fakes don't play normally and they don't upscale correctly here's a tip most fakes are sold as new, and are shrink rapped to look new but they are not, also they tend to come with a realistic looking cover box you'll also notice jagged lines during playback and the picture will go in and out of focus, so buyer beware

Now back to the original disk set there are some nice special features that included  break down of all of season 1 episodes, and a making of short and a convention panel short that's quite nice I'm glad to add season one of the Walking Dead to my DVD and blu ray collection next I'll get season 2 as soon as the price drops. oh one more thing there is no audio commentary that I've noticed unless I didn't find the option but if I'm mistaken I'll revise later thanks for reading my review is for the Walking Dead season 1 Original DVD studio release only if your DVD didn't have the features in this review or played poorly you have a fake.",1338163200,2,1578,4.201320132013201

Somehow I can connect with the characters and want them to survive, and I suppose that's why I kept watching episodes through the first season.  Talk about breathing new life into an old genre!  Also, I love the way the ""walking dead"" are called ""geeks"", since I imagine that geeks make up much of the demographic that make this show so popular.

I gave it three stars because it's obviously low budget (but pretty well acted), requires some suspension of disbelief, and the redneck stereotype guy got sort of predictable (always going off over something) but then again it's a show I watched when I was brain-dead at the end of the day so that stuff didn't matter much.",1338163200,,939,4.373563218390805

You get to know the characters more and more, but they will end up died. The zombies will eventually find and kill a character you grown to like/love, and you don't know who is next to die!

You might think that in all zombies shows, you know a bunch of people and they will die eventually, but it's different with this show. You don't usually get to know those people that MUCH! You really get the feeling that anyone could get caught by a zombie and get infected and just turn into one at anytime, anywhere.

In the story Rick is pretty much the only 1 person, you know for sure, he will not get turned it a zombie. The only reason for that is because he is the MAIN CHARACTER! No, not just a main character, THE MAIN CHARACTER. A main character can still be likely get turned or die in this series.

The story follows Rick and what he is doing most of the time. The show also shows other people like Rick wife, son, and best friend and what they are doing. Rick is trying to find his wife and son, but unkonwn to him is where they are. He believes that they are safe and unharmed, but doesn't know where they are. He gets pieces of info from people he meets to where his family might be.

The people in this story continue to find themselves never ever being save. Even if they think they are ""safe"", they eventually are not safe and have to keep on moving and finding somewhere safe.

There's even a short in there that shows you how you can do your own zombie makeup cheaply for Halloween costumes! I enjoyed this set and can't wait for season 2 to be released.

The whole concept is astoundingly shot where you start to think about what ifs... some scenes make you want to puke, others pull on your heart strings it is a fantastic series and with actors that fit the comic to the point its creepy. I bought this after I found I liked it, and worried that it might not be worth it, I found it totally is. Granted the first season is only 6 episodes but there is so much bonus footage I don't feel ripped off at all. Great deal, and the spammer who said the section where they chop the guy up, isn't there, it absolutely is, so he or she got a defective purchase, or is just being a noob.

4293301,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love the Walking Dead, it is probably my favorite show on Television. The characters are all so dynamic, the zombies look digustingly real, and the tense plot keeps me entertained every week. There are some very deep moments in the show where Rick's leadership comes into question, Shane's role in the group becomes questionable, and various character's mental stability is put to the test. However, the interesting thing is that that can all get interrupted by a hoard of motherless, flesh-eating zombies attacking them, threatening their lives.
As for the DVD itself, there is no reason for it to decrease my review of it any lower. Most people buy them just for the actual shows themselves, with the added content and other features as a bonus. This does not make it cost $50-$60 in stores, but that's why I went to Amazon.com, to get it $30-$40 cheaper.",1334707200,,859,4.8108108108108105

4293305,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This show has a low-budget feel to it. I mean that in a good way. Aside from the zombies (which are certainly not low budget), it is filmed rather simply in rural areas which certainly capture the atmosphere of the south (e.g., that the characters always seem to be slightly sweaty). The pacing is on the slower side, especially in the first season. However, I find that part of its appeal, as it is really a post-apocalyptic drama more than anything. The characters and their conflicts are well developed and make the series worth watching. I would call this show a fine balance between good writing, artful acting, and zombie killing adventure. It is my new favorite show.",1334448000,,674,4.720338983050848

I'm a huge zombie fan and often zombie movies get compared to the remake of Dawn of the Dead, not only do I believe the walking dead to be in the same league, but surpasses the previous bench marks, as a series it is afforded time to tell a real story and develop real charactors.
Blu-ray does the high budget and great make up justice, zombies are believable and detailed even in full HD

4293321,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

After watching these 2 DVDs, I could not believe what I had found. This is a TV SHOW that is MUCH MORE SUSPENSEFUL & GRIPPING than many other horror movies. Not only it contains horror but it also cleverly deals with some psychological matters. For example, it reveals troubles in friendship, and marriage. On top of that, it emphasizes parental love. There are many scenes that emotionally tortured me. For example, some of them forced me to answer the question ""What would you do if your close friend betrayed you?""

This is one of the few TV SHOWS that are so entertaining and yet so unsettling at the same time. It's ONE of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in  terms of horror and suspense.",1333238400,,709,4.5234375

4293323,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"First of all, I would like to say that I love ""zombie"" anything, therefore, I am bias in this review. With that said, however, season one of ""The Walking Dead"" is the best zombie film I've ever seen! It has a great opening and the theme song is something that definitely gets stuck in your head(but in a good way). When Rick wakes up in a hospital after being shot by some schmuck(which totally ripped off 28 Days Later), he walks the deserted hospital laded with corpse and a sealed off room with the eerie words ""Don't open dead inside,"" you immediately start feeling the terror of the harsh reality that ""something"" has drastically gone wrong. As he learns that a zombie(walker) apocalypse has taken place and that his family is missing, most likely having gone to Atlanta, he sets out on a mission to find his family. The entire first season is the epic story of Rick trying to find his family...no, not really, but that would have been really cool if he went the entire season without finding them at all. His family is safe and sound on a hideout thanks to his best friend, Shane. Upon arriving in Atlanta with hopes of finding the shelter and his family, Rick instead learns that the situation he woke into is much worse than he ever imagined...the pilot ends with him being trapped in a tank surrounded by a massive horde of walkers and seemingly no way out.

Stop, if that hasn't gotten you interested, then maybe this series is not for you.

What makes season one so great, imo, is that the story is character-driven and it focuses on ""probability,"" leaving you understanding every hard decision the group has to make in order to survive in this new world; given the realism of the characters, it also forces you to stop and think for a moment, ""How would I react to a zombie apocalypse?"" All the decisions and the way the characters react to each other, the raw emotion under the crisis at hand, and the survival instinct of these characters struggling to maintain their humanity in the new world(more on this last point when season 2 dvd is released), leaves you truly caring and - more importantly - ""understanding"" why the people are making the decisions they make. Another thing that stands out in this series is that the survivors ""feel sorry"" for the walkers and they typically view killing them the same as ""mercy killings."" The characters sympathize with the fact that the walkers were once just like them.

Whenever other networks start making their own zombie apocalypse series, they'll definitely have their work cut out for them to top ""season 1"" of The Walking Dead. The setup was done as great as can be and it leaves you anxious to know where the show is heading!",1332979200,2,2689,4.597916666666666

AMC really hit one out of the ballpark with this! I have the comics and while the show deviates a little, it maintains the  story.

This is about real survival of the human race after the end of the world and about the unthinkable becoming reasonable. It's gritty, disgusting and believable. Talented acting, incredible makeup and riveting storytelling. There are characters I like and some that I just despise. This is the only show I have ever seen that makes me yell things at the TV.

As for the Blu-Ray itself, it easily lives up to the quality of the show. The picture quality is excellent, the sound quality is stunning, & the extras are great: tons of making of docs, special fx featurettes, etc. Plus, I really love the inclusion of the black & white version of the pilot episode (a b&w version was also included on the Blu-Ray of Darabont's highly underrated adaptation of StephenKing's ""The Mist"").

However after reading some reviews and replies to reviews I learned that if you do not select play all, and you select the episodes individually, the scene is there. Why is it like this? I have no clue. But the bottom line is that we can view the episodes complete and uncut if we just select them individually. Good thing, because I was getting ready to return it.

First, vast majority of the female characters are relegated to traditional ""homemaking"" roles even though we all know the rules have changed and will change more drastically in the type of world encountered in The Walking Dead. I  would love to see a female character portrayed as a leader who is capable of doing something more important than the damn laundry!

Second, indoor plumbing (unless using a well system) and electrical power would no longer be available. Obviously, these modern conveniences would shut down within an extremely short period of time since there is no one alive to service these utilities.

Finally, instead of constantly dealing with an old motor home which breaks down frequently, anyone with half a brain would simply commandeer a new and updated motor home. Surely they could have found one in the Atlanta area!!",1332115200,,1006,4.976190476190476

Outside of Romero's film, Dead Snow, and James Gunn's classic remake of Dawn of the Dead, I usually end up panning all zombie fare. The Walking Dead has it all!! Great characters, great action, great zombies and a storyline that just won't quit. The pandemic is and its details are kept in the bag, which is nice for now and the evil characters make the zombies look good which is a nice clever aspect of the series. The acting could be stronger in spots but overall the main characters are very solid. As a reader only a few Z novels make the cut on this level of entertainment: Max Brooks, WORLD WAR Z, MONSTER ISLAND and a great new one i just discovered called BLUE BLOODBATH by Katrina Von Kessel...I hope the producers who did Walking Dead have something to do with Brad Pitts WWZ...they know what they're doing!!!",1329868800,2,869,4.54140127388535

its about time Zombie movies became the norm, iam happy to see great directors making my kind of movie, then making it a TV series.

out of 10, i give it a 8, only because the picture is not 100% if they fixed that i would give it a perfect 10 out of 10,

PS, there is one scene in the first series were a man is trying to shoot his zombie wife and cant do it that scene is powerful both actors made that scene incredible.

I was in.

I was especially happy that AMC was taking this project on, because I love Mad Men, and I have appreciated Breaking Bad from afar (I did watch the first 4 episodes and plan on watching more). To top things off the writer Robert Kirkman, Frank Darabont, Mike Nicotero ,and Gale Anne Hurd were on board. Im a huge fan of all of them. A show like this HAS to have a good cast. The graphic novels are so well loved, and the characters so significant, that to not honor them would be a tragedy. For the most part the cast is a dream there is but one stinker in the bunch (im looking at you Sarah Wayne Callies).

A show that follows a book/novel/comic cannot just stick to the original story line like glue, you have to veer off at some point and make new paths. The smart fans will understand that, the fans with half a brain eaten wont. I happen to love where they take this season, what they added and what they took away. It made perfect sense to me.

The makeup ...oh the special effects! I couldn't have asked for better Walkers (they are never called zombies...i love that) from the ""hero"" dead, to the glimpsed and shot dead, its all a giant bloody rotten orgasm to my eyes. This show made even non undead lovers, a fan of the genre. I mean who hasn't watched a Romero movie and just wanted it to keep on and on and on!!!

It wasn't just your run of the mill mindless zombie show. It had a plot with characters you could like and wanted to follow. The show is intelligent and well produced. It does for zombies what ""Twlight"" did for vampires, but The Walking Dead"" is much scarier. It's so realistic it makes you wonder could it really happen.

I may be biased by the developments that happened in the second season, but I really appreciate the pace at which this is moving.  They started us right off with the action, and we will learn more about the characters first.  It makes sense that some of the characters die before we really get to know them... What else would be more realistic in a post-apocalyptic world with all kinds of dangers around.  We will get to know these characters through the memories and flashbacks or even just references from other characters.  If you want realism, accept that group members are dying, and expect that some of the main characters are going to die, as well.

Somebody responded to this review and showed me that I was way off on my review and they were right. I forget the person's name who wrote to me and opened my eyes that what I wrote was wrong, and he was so right and very constructive with his criticism. So I deleted my old review and I now admit that I was way off in the disrespectful things I had said.

4293356,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"Trust me, I wanted to like this show.  I paid good money to buy the dvd set, having not seen the show previously on cable TV.  But I just couldn't get past the gazillion huge giant gaping gaps of logic (in the writing).  Spoiler alert hence forth:

1) How does the main character, Grimes, end up in a COMA (for over a month!) from a gunshot to his ribcage?

2) How does Grimes survive in a coma for what, several weeks, in a deserted hospital without any intake of water or food at all????  It had to be weeks without food or water, right?  Right?  Enough time for Grimes' best friend to start ""doing"" Grimes' wife--I assume she didn't just start having sex with the guy in just days.

3) When Grimes heads to Atlanta to find his missing wife and son, why in hell would he abandon his police car for a horse!!!!?  Who the hell in their right mind would go horseback riding through a zombie infested landscape!?  And if he did find his wife and son while on horseback, how would all three ride on one horse?  And at the farm where he gets the horse, he doesn't even check the farm vehicles for gas? I mean, come on!  There's zero common sense given to the characters in this show!

4) In Atlanta, Grimes ends up inside a tank surrounded by zombies and he never tries to start the tank!!??  I mean wouldn't you want to see if you could drive the tank to escape!?  Yet, he never even tries to start it.  Also, he's got a .50 caliber machine gun on top of the tank yet never thinks to try to use it to kill some of the zombies!

5) The band of survivors that his son and wife are among AREN'T holed inside some defendable and secure location such as a bank, police station, prison or army base?  Instead, they're just OUTSIDE, unprotected, living in flimsy tents????  With no defenses beside a few strings of tin cans as a ""warning.""  Ah, yeah, guess what?  They get attacked and a bunch of survivors get killed.  What would you expect living outside in a zombie infested area!!!!?

6) The band of survivors ""trapped"" in the department store have been ""surviving"" against the zombies for a month, yet they're barely armed at all????  Just a handgun or two and a hunting rifle.  In this country there are over 300 million guns, more guns than there are people.  Ah, if you're fighting against hordes of zombies to survive, don't you think every survivor would have a crapload of guns and ammo???? And the blonde woman with the silver pistol doesn't even know how to use it!  She never even thought to ask anyone how to fire her gun!!!!????  AND... what's with their clothes?  Instead of tactical clothing or army-type fatigues, they wear things like fashionable and pretty silk blouses????  And none of them wear any anti-zombie protective gear to protect themselves against bites?  No police riot gear, no bulletproof vests, no thick motorcross pants or jackets or gloves or helmets?

7) And the survivors vehicles consist of a broken down old motorhome and an open-air jeep!?  When they could easily get tanks, armored trucks, military HUMVEES, buses, or brand NEW motorhomes????  I mean, nearly everyone's dead, they can take or use whatever vehicle they want.

8) And guns!!!!  In one episode a gang of Latinos and a group of survivors are set to kill each other over one lousy bag of handguns and shotguns when there's military machine guns just sitting in the streets???  And the survivors are content with arming themselves with crummy revolvers and pump action shotguns when then easily could and should be armed with assault rifles, Saiga shotguns and/or military weaponry???

9) And the characters are always saying there's no gas?  When they're constantly coming across hundreds if not thousands of idle vehicles?  There's no gas in ANY of them!?  But how would they know?  There's not one scene of any character checking a vehicle to see if it has gas in its tank!

Honestly, it seems ZERO thought was put into writing this show from a stand point of logic.  The writers obviously didn't get into the minds of the characters or the situations they face and consequently there's NO plausibility to the character's actions in most scenes.  Too bad, because this could have been a good show--it's a good premise.  But it's just too poorly written to be truly entertaining.",1329091200,24,4276,4.58784676354029

My only pet peeve is that we really don't know how humanity perished and it is odd to see abandoned military vehicles and installations.  What happened to the soldiers!?  Minor quibbles aside, this is a first rate series and harkens us back to George Romero's zombies.  I only hope the series can maintain its momentum.

4293362,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"i am a year behind in watching this because frankly the last thing i wanted to see was another zombie based show.  i was amazed AMC would get behind the idea following on the heels of its successes with Mad Men and Breaking Bad, two of the best shows on tv.  i should have had more faith.  yes, there are zombies.  but the story arc is really about those who survived, a very few, who continue the struggle to stay alive.  far from concentrating on one zombie battle after another, the struggles among these few survivors is what makes the show a runaway hit.

one of the most affecting moments in the show is when one of the survivors loses her sister to the zombies.  she remains with the corpse and no one can budge her.  they think she doesn't realize her sister will come back as a zombie. however, she is well aware of this and is handling her grieving and the final disposition of her sister exclusively.

another key moment is when the love affair between two people is brought to a crashing halt when her husband shows up alive.  it turns out that her lover lied to her about her husband's being dead. the two men, once police partners, now must work on surviving together while also being in love with the same woman.

all in all, i thought it was great and am eager to now start watching the second season, now playing.

4293363,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Most folk reading this probably read the graphic novels and watched the first season as it was aired on A&E and then bought the DVD/BD when it became available. I know that was how I experienced the show. When this re-release was announced, I actually found myself looking forward to the Special Edition.

The reasoning is simple - every episode had at least one commentary track (Pilot Ep has two in fact). A whole slew of featurettes, and the original pilot... shot in unrelenting black & white. I've gone through most of the special features and have greatly enjoyed the commentary, specifically director Frank Darabont's musings through the Pilot. He describes the series as an event that allowed him to do the sort of film he'd always wanted to.

Yes, from the man who did Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile. But we know his involvement simply meant that folk would take this project seriously, and as it should be. You can't sell a survival horror story without the deep humanizing that we see in this much too short of it's first season.

One note: commentary tracks may 'dare' you to point out an f/x shot that was done practically or digitally; apparently they think these effects are done so well, you can't tell. Well, for that I have only one thing to say...

CGI is very clear on a big 47"" screen and PS3 BD.

Now, it is amazing that they now reveal their is a lot more CGI in these introductory shots. The military base outside the hospital... whole thing: CGI, except for a heli shell, but even it's blades were CGI.

I've written this review specifically to give you as possible buyers what you are getting into. If you are a fan of just the show and don't go for new bonus features and whatnot, don't feel bad and hang on to your original purchase when it was first released. Keep it. It's a great set that I own as well.

But I geek out over the tech stuff. So this Special Edition is a beautiful addition to my BD collection. Bottom line it: do you go geek over zombies? If you do, even in the slightest, pick this up.

And I can almost swear that picture is much, much improved upon. Now you should go back and switch it to 7.1 sound. Re-release again.

And I'll buy it again.",1328054400,9,2201,4.441687344913151

4293367,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is based on a best-selling comic book, and the first of its kind to hit basic cable television. Never before has anyone pushed the envelope to actually incorporate the intensity of zombie apocolypse violence on cable tv, as the idea of zombies has always been left to full-length motion picture filmmakers. This only pushes the character of the zombie to further affix itself to modern culture hopefully as much as the vampire has. Usually many television shows can easily bring vampires to public audiences, and even to Disney channel ones, only because the violence factor of vampires has always been relatively mild. Anyone doing anything with zombies though, would need to amp up the violence/gore factor, which is perhaps why no one has dared to do it; until of course, The Walking Dead.
This is a fairly short season, consisting of only 6 episodes, and that is a good thing, considering that a season running about 15 to 20 would be way too much. Regular dramas can do this only because the meat of the show itself, killing zombies, would become way too old if overdone. This season feels more like an introduction to the zombies and our characters more than anything else. With that, we have the typical zombie storyline - world becomes overrun at the offset, one protagonist must find his missing family, we meet others along the way, people fight, split, separate, etc. If you have been watching zombie films since George Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead,"" this storyline will not be anything new. What we do look forward to is the characters, their likability, the special effects, etc.

Now, while TWD works, it doesn't revolutionlize anything. The zombies are the star of the show here really, no really our characters. Zombies are made up of a mix of CGI and make-up, making the characters themselves very real, but lots of their guts and gore mostly all computer generated. It is noticeable, and a bit disappointingly so, as I still cannot fathom how even after all these years of CGI we still cannot make splashing and squirting blood real looking enough. Anyway, while the gunplay isn't to the point of a video game splatterfest (although THAT is a full-on action episode I would LOVE to see... even though it would only work for ONE episode, after which it would just get old), it still is heavy enough where a good number of our characters die in some pretty gory ways. I myself was a bit shocked to see such gore could even be shown on television, which is good considering this show really is doing something new. This is definitely for mature audiences, and I wouldn't recommend any children under the age of 17 to be exposed to it (15 if they can take it).
Still, even though our zombies make a good show, our characters and their plots are simply PRETTY good to OK. They all play their parts well, but nobody really GRABS us, makes us jawdrop or wows us in any way. They are just basically people trying to survive, and admist some standard dialogue, mixed with a flair of cheesy writing, we never really are found rooting for our survivors. I must say though that the writers do geniunely try, they just haven't really found that magic as of yet; maybe they will 2nd season.
By the end we sort of end up where we start. I won't give anything away but we are left at the end of the season with simply a good INTRODUCTION to our show, not really much else (really just ONE thing we know will lead to a plot twist in season 2, but just one).

Yet this is a good show, I have to give them credit for their guts (in more ways than one), and one zombie fans will enjoy and take pride in. I'm just hoping for more plot twists and character development as the seasons go on, as this season does it very minimally. As far as a decent drama, it's there, and you can't beat the gore, you really can't. 4 stars really for a progressive idea, ambitious storytelling and action.

As far as extras, it's your pretty standard fare, which isn't bad: interviews with the director, cast and creators, behind the scenes footage of make-up, etc, a run down of each episodes behind the scenes features.
If you want a bigger content of extras I would recommend buying the 3-disc special edition, featuring lots of featurettes about zombies themselves. This I would think more enjoyable considering it most likely would go into the history of zombies in filmmaking, hence talkign about the culture of zombies and them as creatures beyond what this show presents to us. A little pricier but I would think well worth it for the zombie fanatic. All others merely interested in only this show, this BD provides enough.",1327536000,2,4641,4.623030303030303

4293378,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I bought it as fast I could, when special edition wasn't avaliable.
Blue Ray Disc 1 includes all 6 episodes + extra content. The seoncd one is also a blu ray and has bonus content.  Only the episodes has spanish subtitles, extras doesn't. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
Right now, for the price, you can buy the special edition wich includes a 3rd bluray disc. Even so, this is a great version.",1326585600,2,393,4.3108108108108105
4293379,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"Characters are dull.
Their motivation makes no sense most of the time.
They constantly bicker for no reason other than to fill time.
The zombies make no sense.
The rules of contamination are unclear and keep being broken.
The capabilities of zombies keep changing.
The series is heavily doused in estrogen, in an attempt to attract fenale viewers. Do we need romance and intrigue in a zombie movie?
We have the irritating stereotypes again, most notably the white redneck. But then we have Mexicans who only look like criminals but are in fact decent hospital staff. Some people cringed I am sure, and wondered if some p.c. staff edited the script before they started shooting.
Oh, and how do you put the main character inside a TANK surrounded by zombies and not have him drive it and mow them down with machine guns? What a waste of what could have been the greatest scene in the history of zombie movies...

Final verdict:
This series is mainly frustrating, but it has some good action as well and some pretty good zombies. I sugest that you watch it while doing the washing up or something, so you can do your housework during the dull scenes and concentrate on the ones with action. You won't miss anything, every single round of bickering is identical, with the same characters saying the same things over and over again.",1326585600,3,1327,4.695278969957082

I also had to resort to plugging my ears during a scene of chopping up a zombie body with an ax that went on forever.  I couldn't watch and all the splattering blood and organs or stand the graphic sound effects.  Too much violence for me.....

4293402,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"When I was introduced to The Walking Dead comic a couple years ago, I was blown away.  Great, taut writing that is thrilling and unpredictable.  At first, when I heard it was coming out on TV (not on HBO), I was immediately suspicious.  American TV has very strange rules, as are American sensibilities.  We can see all the gore and violence we want, but show a boob or say f--k, and many Americans' ears and eyes begin to bleed.  A strange dichotomy, to be sure, but there is a lot of all of these elements in the book, as well as some very extreme situations that I thought would not translate well to the small screen.

It turns out my fears were unfounded.  AMC was able to take a great book (for more info, see my or other reviews on the compendium) and make a truly great show.  The focus is still there; that is, the main characters are what is important, not the zombies.  They are almost incidental to what is going on.  They just frame the situations the characters must face, and that is the true genius of the story.

But something else I found great about the TV show is that it does not slavishly follow the source material, changing it subtly in places, drastically in others, to create an all-new entertainment experience that rivets me to the tube every week.  If you read the book, it is a good introduction to the show and vice-versa.  But what is great is if you liked one, you only get the outline for the other.  You get two great experiences.

The extras on tacked on and like most DVD extras, are totally dumb and unnecessary.  Mostly, it is just people in the cast, crew and writers congratulating each other on how great it is as a story and how wonderful it is to work with each other.  Honestly, I can only see this so much until it makes me throw up.  Tell me interesting stories in making it, obstacles you had to overcome, the adversity of making the show.  None of these productions are harmonious in nature or smooth in execution.  I want to know the hiccups and travails.  THAT, ultimately, is what is interesting.  But the show is really why we buy these things, so get it and be prepared to be wowed.

One last thing, do NOT show to children.  This is some pretty extreme stuff, hard R to NC-17 territory.",1325635200,2,2241,4.357487922705314
4293403,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!! Originally watched the series on Netflix and this was instantly worthy of being added to my movie collection.

4293408,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Cinematic in scope, The Walking Dead Season One is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Yes, some episodes are better than others, but all are riveting and well crafted.  Because this is a TV show with no requirement for wrapping up a story in 90 minutes (as opposed to a film), we're treated to satisfying character development, intertwining stories that entertain and sets that were obviously designed with care.

If you're not a fan of zombie flicks, don't worry...you don't have to be.  They may provide the thrills and chills, but this series is really about people and how they react and interact in the face of an impossible crisis.  Watch Episode One and I can all but guarantee you'll be wanting more.",1325289600,2,706,4.754098360655738

The series is certainly disturbing but it is actually well acted, well written, and well shot. The character development is really good. You actually get drawn into the story and forget that it is one of the most cliche plot themes around.

I certainly did not expect to like it so much but I have to recommend that, provided you are not squeamish about horror movies, you should check this out.",1325203200,3,493,4.6022727272727275

This was another pleasant surprise for me and i thought i would review it so that the  rest of the living dead fans know that this is NOT just another cheesy zombie film. This is serious... and it was beautifully done!!!..The acting is good, cinematography is just perfect and those zombies are really great..they actually  have a really serious and creepy looks!!  Far more realistic than lots of zombies in other movies......

It is my 3rd movie i watched from director Frank Darabont, he also directed the ""The Shawshank Redemption , The green Mile and The Mist by Stephen king. The walking Dead will be another strong addition to his work!!! The movies as a really apocalyptic atmosphere as the zombies are everywhere and a group of survivors will have to quickly get organized if they wanna survive...pretty much everyone is dead or gone and this epic battle to survive will finally bring them to understand what really caused all this and why..........

If you like zombie movies then you owe it to yourself to give it a shot!!  This is really good and i cant wait to get my hands on the 2nd season, i know its on TV right now but i would rather have the whole thing with me when i start it cause i sometimes like to watch more than one episode without having to wait for the next week......im sure you'll feel the same way after watching the 1st episode!!!

So i am one of the few ppl on this planet who actually likes audio commentary, and this has that in spades.  episodes one through six all have that.  theres the black and white pilot episode, which isn't as great as i was hoping, but its interesting to watch once. those are about the only great special features for the set, if you don't care for those, i suggest you buy the normal dvd set.  for a collectors set i was expecting better special feature, or at the very least a better box to put the dvds in.  the illustration on the dvds, and where you put them into are great, but the rest of the box design is sub par.  even something as small as a plastic cover to put the box into is missing.

4293439,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I will be honest... I don't watch TV anymore. There is nothing on worth watching, and if there is, Fox will cancel it within 2 months in favor of another Seth McFarlane show that no one will ever watch.

When I heard about Walking Dead, I thought that a series about zombies would not take off. I figured, no one I know is really into zombies, how can this show last? Well... I loved it. I would stop what ever I was doing in order to watch this show.

Sure, some of the characters are not very good, and in fact, you HOPE they get killed by a Walker just so they never have to return. How ever, this show makes you think... it makes you jump... and you cannot guess what is going to happen as it continues, which is what I LOVE about a TV show. Unlike reality TV, which is for the ""lowest common denominator"" of people... shows like this actually force you to think while watching, which is as good as it gets.

The costumes for the Walkers are top-notch, and in fact, surpass most of the zombie movies made in the last decade. You will see all sorts of unique Walkers... if you decide to look hard enough. The work and detail they put into making unique zombies is indeed incredible.

While the series does not follow the comics at all... aside from the first couple of episodes, its a good thing... as you will not know what to expect. Shane does survive in the comics, as he is killed by Carl, and he never gets to the farm house you see in Season 2. That in itself leaves room for the unexpected.

I hope this series continues for years to come... best show on TV!",1323734400,,1569,4.1993355481727574
4293440,5,B0049P1ZZQ,A friend of mine told me I just HAD to watch The Walking Dead. They promised I wouldn't be disappointed! They were right. My only disappointment is that the first season is only 6 episodes long. That is not nearly enough zombies! It is like watching a zombie movie that just doesn't end. It is fabulous! You absolutely must watch!,1323648000,,330,4.516666666666667
4293441,5,B0049P1ZZQ,The walking dead is one of those shows that comes along only once in a lifetime. It takes the subject of zombies and turns it into a fun ride that keeps you begging for more. I would like them to make more then 12 or 14 episodes per season.,1323388800,,240,3.9183673469387754

4293443,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Simply put, ""The Walking Dead"" is right now one of the best television dramas of the last several years. I never read Robert Kirkman's original epic comic book series, however, I never read the Harry Potter books or read the Lord of the Rings books either, and yet I loved the film adaptations of those stories to the point I felt I didn't need to. ""The Walking Dead"" is brilliant...AND TERRIFYING!! The fact it's on cable (AMC channel)is wonderful. I like zombie fiction. I'm a huge fan of George Romero's legendary ""Living Dead"" film series...however, this is something completely different!

Most zombie films, the best ones anyway, try to give you compelling heroic human characters who struggle to hold things together while the world we know has been destroyed amidst the dead rising up and the brutal carnage reaches a fever pitch. ""Walking Dead"" gives us human characters, who try to always do the heroic thing, yet sometimes the line between heroism and viciousness gets somewhat blurred. I like that. This is a world where everything is upside down, inside out, and even the best intentions can have dire consequences. A ragtag band of survivors, led by Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Shane (Jon Bernthal)and Rick's wife travel through Atlanta trying to seek safe haven from the undead scourge. In the series, the creatures aren't referred to as zombies, but as ""Walkers"". According to Kirkman, this is a world in which no one has ever heard of or seen a zombie, even in a fictional setting, and this leads to the series giving us a realistic tone to the undead.

Trust me, these ""Walkers"" are gruesome, and vicious, and scary! There are more scares in this series than what we see in most theatrical features nowadays. You never know when the luck of these human survivors will run out, and thats the power of dramatic tension. Right now we're in the middle of its second season (however, its split in half, with the remainder of the season resuming in February next year). I loved the first season, although it was too short with only six episodes. I had to buy the blu ray 3 disc collection; I'm loving this series soooo much. Kudos to Executive Producer Frank Darabont, co-producer Kirkman, make-up effects creator Greg Nicotero, the excellent cast and the writers who know its not always about the ""monsters"", but about the human drama that surrounds it. Well done. Keep em comin'.",1323302400,,2388,4.821951219512195
4293444,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I never thought that I would be a fan of such a horrific display of gruesome flesh eating ""zombies"".  I have to say that I really enjoyed watching these episodes.  The quality of the shows combined are very clear.  I received my DVD yesterday by USPS and it was packaged in a bubble envelope, very secure.  It took approx about 4-5 days with standard shipping. I actually became a fan of this show in the middle of season 2, so being able to purchase season 1 and catch up on the older episodes at my leisure is great.",1323216000,,518,4.255102040816326
4293445,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I'm a big fan of horror.  HOWEVER, the zombie genre is waaaaaay down on the bottom of my 'to watch' list.  I've seen them, but personally I don't like them very much, never really have.  Maybe it's because at one time these were human beings.  Heck, even the young aren't spared the possibiltiy of being turned into a rotling.  And, it's never just one zomboid comin' after your arse, but a bagillion at once. The walking dead have always just creeped me out!

With that being said my son MADE me watch the first episode.  I was sooooo agitated, uneasy, and hyper darn near yelling at the TV to ""SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, DON'T GO IN THERE, RUN YOU SOB, RUN!!, DON'T GO DOWN IN THAT PITCH BLACK STAIRWELL, DON'T DO THAT, GO GO GO!!!  (alas, the TV nor the actors ever listen!).  Yet, by the end of the first episode and how it ended, I felt strangely compelled to watch another episode. YEAH.... let's set myself up for more MAJOR squik factors, agitation, and nightmares which are sure to follow!

Needless to say, I'm hooked!!  I love this show!  It's so much more than just the rotlings looking for their next snackie. Plus you find yourself saying, ""Oh hell no..... a person wouldn't do this or that"", thereby putting yourself in the situation of how you'd handle yourself in a Zombie Apocalypse.

This show definately elicits strong emotional repsonses from the viewing audience, as this core group of survivors do some bone head things.  I think that's why I get agitated & aggrevated, because in a real life survival situation, you wouldn't DO some of the DUMB THINGS they do. No way in hell I'd be going out into the forest to pick mushrooms alone....ALONE!!!! ""Off I trapse, tra la, tra la....."" I'd have more friggin' armed sentry around me than the Queen of England protectin' my butt!!. I'd also be raiding places for silencers, heck, even poor man silencers would do, (noise attracts the rotlings, among other things).  But then if our group of survivors didn't do all these stupid things, we wouldn't have a show, now would we?  I would soooo want Daryl on my side when things go in the pooper!...  Go Team Daryl! He rocks!!  Glen also has a good head on this shoulders.

There are excellent character dynamics going on.  You come to care about these folks in their quest for survival.  Some of their behavior will shock and surprise.  But that's what makes this show awesome, you're never really sure what's happening next. The special effects are quite good too. The first season was only 6 episodes long.  A&E wanted to see how well this show would be received.  Apparently it's been overwhelmingly positive.  Season 2 is following suit, though a little bit slower paced. They didn't have to cram so much into just six episodes, and the mid-season finale for season 2 was a corker!!

Even those who get squiked and are squimish about rotlings and all things dead should give this series a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how good it is.

4293449,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"LOVE the series! Believe it or not, I hadn't even heard of it until recently, but was able to correct this glaring omission in my personal library thanks to Amazon's Streaming Video Section!

I guess not having heard of it is a doubly bad admission considering I own several large Preparedness Websites... go figure. But since I'm up-to-date now, and Rick's group is obviously struggling through aCOMS (""a Collapse Of Modern Society""), where every noise draws unwanted attention, might I recommend that SOMEONE in their group think about maybe hanging a SILENCER off the end of their weapons? Maybe even spending some time with a Kinetic Bullet-Puller and some Powder Scales to work up some Sub-Sonic rounds for the pistols? They'd only have to dial back the velocity of the 9mm Rounds (or even the 357 in Rick's Colt Python) just a touch to be rid of that loud Super-Sonic, Zombie-Attention-Getting, 'CRAAACK'.

Heck, for that matter, if Daryl can punch a crossbow bolt through a Zombie Skull by hand, maybe all *we* need is a few 22's with ""CBee's""... then we could even carry PLENTY of Zombie-Slaying Ammo without sacrificing the amount of WATER and FOOD that we'll need to get ourselves up to our Pre-Prepared Retreats! OF COURSE *WE* have a small Vacation-Home/Retreat already stocked and waiting up in the Mountains of Georgia/SC/NC/TENN, Right? Because we see how well the people with the ""Bug-Out-Bag-and-Live-in-a-Tent"" plan have been faring so far (IE: Not very well), especially compared to ""life on the farm""... Seriously, leaving home with all of your worldly goods on your back is called ""being a refugee"", which has a LONG and consistent history World-Wide of 'not working very well'... So that Bug-Out-Bag just needs to hold enough stuff to get you up to your Pre-Stocked Zombie-Proof Mountain Retreat... say, ""3 days worth of supplies"" ;)

OK, ok... maybe I'm just getting all technical and Engineery (Occupational Hazard), but if Rick's group will just make a few silencers, at least then they won't be ringing the dinner bell every time they have to tap the trigger on a Walker...  I'm just sayin...",1322870400,,2118,4.97457627118644

4293459,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I loved this television series, I watched the first season in one sitting. Although some scenes may be a little predictable, many that are not. This is a fresh adaptation of the zombie post apocalyptic world that actually has a plot line and character development that leaves me hungry for more.

I was very surprised after reading many of the negative reviews; most of which were complaining about character development and predictability. Maybe it's because I've seen more than the first season, but I find the statements ""one dimensional characters"" to be completely off base. I expected to find no plot or character development, (normal for a zombie/horror movie/shows), but I found a thriller with depth!

I'm half way through season two and I can only think of one character who is basically the same person as season one. Everyone has taken dynamic strides in who they are and what they believe in... Which can be expected in a post apocalyptic world.

I can guess those who said it had poor character development didn't give the series enough time. The first season is probably over the course of a month... if that long. You're not going to see dynamic changes in anyone in this amount of time. Even in this fight or flight mode they're still trying to come to terms with what's actually happening. I also think it's because they fail to remember they're watching a television show about zombies. I would like anyone to name a zombie movie that has better character development... I dare you!

Frank Darabont has taken an excellent comic book series and the theatrical depiction of the zombie post apocalyptic world to the next level... It is by far one of the best television series currently running.

I also love the depictions of zombies, their makeup artist is a genius... By far the best I've ever seen.",1322438400,,1818,4.795527156549521

4293466,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is to zombie movies what The Sopranos was to gangster movies:  a chance to expand the genre into something new and more detailed.  Your standard zombie flick pits a few people against an army of zombies and offers plenty of gory violence.  The Walking Dead does the same thing, but has an emphasis on plot and character that most zombie films don't.  This isn't to denigrate the movies, but you can do a lot more with a story if you have five hours (in the first season) than only 90 minutes.

The Walking Dead's principal protagonist is deputy Rick Grimes who (in shades of 28 Days Later) wakes up from a gunshot-induced semi-coma to find the world is a much grimmer place.  Most of civilization has fallen due to a zombie epidemic (actually, in the show, ""zombie"" is not used; the preferred term is ""walker"").  Fortunately, they are the ""classic"" slow moving zombies; unfortunately, there are millions of them.

The early part of the six-episode season focuses on Grimes's attempts to find his family.  It's not much of a spoiler to indicate his wife and son are alive (it's revealed early on) and eventually he will join them and a group of other survivors.

Grimes's role as an authority figure puts him in a leadership position (taking it over from his cop partner, who had the role first).  It is an inherently unstable position since the law doesn't really exist anymore.  For Grimes, there is also the struggle to maintain his natural integrity.  At one point, he will risk his life (and others') to attempt to rescue a nasty drug-addled racist.  Later, he will drive a decision for the group to leave their camp and seek refuge at a different place, a location that will seem safer but also bears a terrible secret.

Since you are with these characters for a longer period of time than in a movie, they wind up involving you more, which heightens the suspense.  This is one of the goriest TV series to ever appear on a non-premium channel, but it works in its context.  It won't appeal to a lot of people for this reason, but for those who like zombie stories, this is superb entertainment.",1321747200,,2116,4.6

world. He doesn't even know if anyone else is alive as his outer
security cameras only show corpses piled up all around town. As he's
recording a video diary we get two new nuggets of info: It's been 194
days since ""wildfire"" was declared and 63 days since the disease went
inexplicably global.

What we don't know is what wildfire is. Could be a mutated vaccine he
was working on, could be a random outbreak from nature, could even be
an offshoot from a passing comet. Who knows? But over the last 6.5
months the situation has been getting worse, and about 2 months past it
became apparent no place on earth was safe from it. Which begs a few
questions, like, is Atlanta Ground Zero for the problem and as you go
farther away the problem is less pronounced? If so, that could be even
worse for people living far from the city as perhaps there was a flash
point phase where healthy people got sick without being bitten by a
walker. Perhaps the disease was airborne first and then altered. (Which
would go a long way towards explaining why there are so many zombies
walking around. Normally a body decomposes to liquidity within a month
without preservatives. Perhaps whatever is causing the walkers to
reanimate serves as a preservative too?) Maybe one reason family groups
survived is because they carry a resistant gene. Again, who knows? Point is, if for some reason this actually happened, these are all rational questions to be asked. I'm surprised this group is so wait-and-see about the end of the world. Obviously this is a little more than FEMA can handle. They've survived this long; now start defining some better parameters for going forward rather than just the nomadic caravan idea. Get to high ground. Find a water supply. Build a fence. These aren't tough ideas to come up with.

PS- the old man with the beard and Glenn, the Asian pizza delivery kid,
make this series. They are consistently the voice of self-preservation
balanced with logical reasoning. (In contrast to Rick, who always does the least logical thing concerning safety and planning.)",1320969600,,2341,4.693430656934306

4293479,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I bought this box set as I loved the T.V. show and wanted to add it to my collection of movies. And as such, this won't be a review of the T.V. show, as I figure most of you interested in the box set have either seen the show or at least some of it.

I'd like to point out that the video quality isn't up to Blu-Ray standards. By that I mean there are camera shots that are crystal clear then the scene switches to another camera and it is as grainy as an eighties T.V. show on an era correct T.V. To me, that is disappointing and points out that the show didn't have the budget for HD camera's, or something of that sort.

The extras were good and I really liked the mini documentary about the make up used and how they created a ""Zombie School"" to teach the extras playing zombies how to walk and move about.

Interviews with the cast and director and even Kirkman are also interesting. It was a good jumping off point for me to dive into the books (I bought the compendium after watching season one).

To summarize, the Blu-Ray set isn't worth the money in my opinion as the video quality isn't top shelf all the way through. Let's be honest, you get Blu-Ray because the video quality and sound quality matter to you and you wan that little extra. For me, if the DVD set is the same as the Blu-Ray I can't see why you'd pay the extra money and not get the extra you wanted.

4293481,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is the story of Rick Grimes, a sheriff's deputy who woke up from a coma only to find out a zombie apocalypse had taken place in the interim. The show opens with Rick shooting a zombie, flashes back to the shooting that put him into the coma, and then forward to him waking up. He shortly sets off on a quest to find his family. The Walking Dead is based on the Robert Kirkman comics, but does at times depart significantly from them.

After several movies (28 Days Later, I Am Legend) with fast zombies, The Walking Dead returns to slower zombies (but not too slow). The only way to put them down is to kill the brain. A bite will pass the infection. Zombies don't have much to say other than, `AAAAGGGHHH!'

The zombies look great. The writers and directors know how to start a scene off on a slow simmer then ratchet up the danger level. The shot of Rick entering a dead Atlanta on horseback was instantly iconic. The opening credits create the perfect mood.

Some of its best work is expanding on what is in the comics (e.g., Rick arriving in camp). The medium allows scenes to be drawn out to allow the viewer to really soak in the emotion. Sometimes they push it a bit too far, though (e.g., the fishing scene). A lot of the new stuff is phenomenal as well (e.g., anything with Merle or Daryl). TV allows you to examine your characters and the effect of a zombie apocalypse on human interactions, but the show is sometimes clumsy at doing so. Coupled with the tendency of the characters toward stereotypes, I have the niggling sense that the writers could have created something much better but thought we're too stupid to appreciate it. There is a sad reversion to the horror norm that women only react to danger by screaming helplessly.

In another example of ""dumbing down"" for television, we are given significant expository information on the zombie ""infection"" and the collapse of world civilization in an info dump near the end of the season. Presumably driven again by lack of faith in the viewer, the writers sucked a lot of the horror of the unknown out of the show.

The writers also get somewhat lazy in their storytelling from time to time. For example, characters exclaim that it is 100 degrees outside the day after a character was complaining about the cold; temperatures in Atlanta don't vary that much from night to day.

DVD extras include The Making of the Walking Dead, six Inside the Walking Dead episode guides, A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman, Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-Up Tips, Convention Panel with Producers, and The Walking Dead Trailer. They have replaced traditional episode commentaries with short videos (~5-6 minutes each) of the characters and creators talking about the episode interspersed with clips of the episode. This has several advantages over a traditional commentary: it is far less tedious to watch, he keeps the contributors on focus, and it avoids spoilers (you could watch each clip after the corresponding episode).",1320364800,3,2991,4.7203065134099615

4293488,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"What a great show! A chip off the old block that is an excellent adaptation of Robert Kirkman's graphic novel. The show combines elements of the comic's first and second editions, plus adds new material to keep. We get the camp outside Atlanta PLUS it is set in a rock quarry with a lake. We get Morgan and Dune (Rick's early saviors) PLUS their wife/mom, who was missing from the book.  A few new characters - notably Merle, the redneck crossbowman - bring additional zing to the cast, which is notably more diverse than it was in the book.

The TV adaptation often improves on the original, giving us time to get to know the characters before they are inevitably chomped by zombies. It also makes more sense of Shane and Lori's relationship before Rick shows up at camp. In the book, Rick and Lori had a perfect relationship - which didn't square with Lori falling for Shane after just a few weeks. The show fixes that problem, and gives us more of the Shane-Rick-Lori love triangle to enjoy. Andrea and Amy get to bond as sisters. Dale sprinkles the fireside chats with Faulkner.

I thought I would be put off by the gore (the book was drawn in black and white) but it is bearable - if very intense. Nothing like watching half-rotted zombie corpses being beaten, blasted, battered and dissected in full color to keep the nervous system a-tingle.

The Walking Dead"" Season One is very watchable, with fun characters and impossible situations. Not at all soap-opery, and great treat. Rauughr!",1319587200,,1493,4.665399239543726
4293489,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"""The Walking Dead"" is an adaptation of a graphic novel series with the same name.  It is one of the best miniseries to come on TV in a while.  There are many detailed reviews on this product, so I will keep my review brief.

The story focuses on approximately 15 main characters who are trying to survive after the dead have started coming back to life.  In some ways, it is an affirmative action sampling of the population since all groups are represented. (Which seems a little fake, but in a place like Atlanta it could happen.) The walking dead are zombies in the traditional sense...they want to eat living things and they are killed by destroying the brain.  They're typically referred to as ""walkers"" in this series.

The first episode focuses primarily on the hero, Rick Grimes, who is a police officer that wakes up in the hospital after being in a coma.  Gradually, he learns the reality of the apocalyptic world.  A few of the other survivors are introduced to us in Episode 1 as well.

The remainder of the episodes deal with a wider group of people and a few ""quests"" to either find someone or rescue someone.  The final episode of Season 1 seemed a little out of place with the previous tone of the movie, but it ended the season with a hard hitting reality check: there is no safety in Atlanta.  Many of the characters do come across as stereotypes, but there will be more seasons for character development.

People will enjoy this series if they realize that it focuses on the characters more than blasting zombies.  It's a human interaction story.  Just don't take it too seriously or think too hard about it.  Just enjoy it and remember it was based on comic books.",1319500800,,1683,4.54485049833887

4293497,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Squeezing a coherent post-apocalyptic, zombie-filled world into six episodes is a difficult task in and of itself.  Doing so with the addition of real human drama, life wrenching, soul tearing, audience crying drama, is another thing entirely.  The Walking Dead not only does this, but the six episode first season is a generally compelling story.

Much like 28 Days Later, the protagonist (Rick Grimes, played by Andrew Lincoln) for The Walking Dead awakens from a coma in a hospital room without assistance.  Upon departure of the hospital, he learns that the world has fallen into chaos, where the dead have risen to attack and eat the living, filling their ranks with each newly infected victim.  His wandering leads him to Atlanta, a city infested and overrun.  Luckily he unites with a scavenger cell from a group that has staked claim near a massive rock quarry just outside the city.  After mutually helping one another, Rick is welcomed back to the camp that is harboring his wife Lori (Sarah Callies), his young son Carl, and is being led by his former Sheriff's Deputy partner Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal).  The new group must battle the zombies, themselves, each other, and the general despair permeating throughout the world.  Regardless of the impossible premise, it's nearly unfathomable for a viewer not to associate with the characters.

And that's just the setting and actors!  The action and special effects are top notch, with blood splatter and brain matter painting walls like so much graffiti.  Intensity is definitely not lacking.

The Blu-ray contains all six of the episodes that make up the first season.  My only complaint comes from that fact, six episodes leaves me desperately wanting more.  The zombie's in the series are beautifully done.  They stay true to the slow dumb zombie mold as opposed to the fast and thinking zombies that appear in some movies.  The zombie story has been told before, the main character wakes up from a coma to world that is incredibly different from the one he knew (stop me if this sounds familiar).  What sets this series apart from the countless other zombie stories out there is the character development.  The character story lines are wonderfully done and leave the viewer feeling a connection to the survivors.

The blu-ray quality on these were a little off-putting.  There were some scenes that were very grainey and kind of annoying.  I kind of overlooked it however because of how much a fan of the series I am, but if you're a person who dwells on blu-ray quality you may not be too happy with this.

The second episode brings the full cast of main characters fully into play and pits the survivors precarious situation and alliances agains an unstopable hord of undead, this was also good, this continues into the thrid episode and frankly the series was pretty much on a roll here. after this we start to see what the meat of the show looks like which is in essance how to survive a zombie appocalyps permanently. amongst the last three episode the begin to get into that, some of this is frustrating but in the same way as its frustrating to watch the 'hot chick' haplessly walk outside into danger that audience obviuosly saw comming, and some of it is in that some of their (the survivors) ideas are simply bad or insufficient. Really though, this is to be expected if you are a fan of the genre.

4293509,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"THE WALKING DEAD

I have been reading the comic since it was released and that is no lie. I am a big fan of zombies in any format mainly because my brother is literally scared of them. I can't help it but I love it. So when I first that the comic was being turned into a series I was super excited. I had always believed that this would be the right format for such a grand story. If this was made into a feature film there is no way it could fit all that it would need to.

Now as a big fan of the comic from Robert Kirkman I could tell you anything that is spot on direct and anything changed but that would take the fun out of it. Plus for any one who has not read it or is not a comic reader this is a very stand alone show. Any one who has read the comic I will say that you should not be disappointed, sure the comic is classic but this show is also really good. Well cast, acted, written, and directed, I would have to say that this was and is a great show.

The great first season was six episodes long with each paced very well and surprisingly kept in tact what the comic was about. That of course is the humans and not the zombies; it really is a character driven story. I knew with Frank Darabont on board this would be made right. He did a great job here has I really enjoyed this show, from TV all the way to DVD/Blu-Ray.

The story follows a cop named Rick Grimes who is shot in the line of duty; he ends up in a coma. When he finally awakes no one is to be found and he is all alone, alone in the hospital. He now is on the hunt for his wife and son who as far as he knows are missing. Everything he knew and loved is gone, and besides meeting two new friends they go their own ways. He heads to Atlanta based on a tip to find his family and runs into undead and other survivors along the way. Now outside of the city it turns out wife Lori and his son Carl are with another group of survivors including Rick's best friend and co worker Shane Walsh. They all believe Rick to be dead so that leads to an interesting dynamic for our little group of friends.

Like I said before this is a character driven story and it really helps the show out. Now of course the ""walkers"" are there ready to eat all humans, and there are a lot of them. When there is action there is some good action but the story is really strongest amongst the living. So one group is already out there surviving and one man is out there in the middle of it all looking for his family. Do they find each other, well I say watch the show or read the comic to find out.

I will just say that the entire cast was great in my opinion and were wonderfully cast. So there is no need to go one by one since they were all great. Of the six episodes Frank Darabont was a writer on four and directed the first episode. I would also like to point out that Ernest Dickerson directed an episode, you may know him as a Spike Lee protg who directed classics like ""Juice"" and ""Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight"". Any way the writers and directors for this sure all did a good job here.

Now special features for the two disc set include a making of, inside each episode, sneak peaks, behind the scenes, a convention panel, and the trailer. Now of course now they have released a three disc edition to get more money out of me. Of course I am going to shell out even though I really shouldn't. I hear there are commentaries on each episode, dang them for adding that. I am a big fan of this so I need to get it.",1318118400,3,3478,3.981348637015782
4293510,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"I realize that I'm going against the grain here, but I couldn't stand this show.  As another reviewer said, the first episode was quite good.  It sucked after that!  I had to quit in the middle of the series.  The characters are extremely one-dimensional, and everything that happened was incredibly predictable.  All of this is coming from a huge, life-long fan of horror films and books.  I spent much of my time watching this show thinking ""yep...  I've seen that before.""  Or ""I bet this'll happen next!""  Sure enough, my predictions usually transpired.

The Good:  Nice visuals and beautiful cinematography.  Even though I didn't like the show, it looks great in HD!
The Bad:  One-dimensional characters, highly-predictable story line and the audio effects were way too over-the-top.

My recommendation:  If you're gonna watch this, try not to spend too much money!",1318032000,18,870,5.070921985815603

4293518,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I am a life long horror fan and waited patiently to buy the DVD set for the first season of THE WALKING DEAD, for me it is the only way to watch this kind of TV.  And I must say the show was well worth the wait: THE WALKING DEAD is the best new show on TV in years and I commend AMC and Frank Darabont for having the guts to put it on the air; I mean, a TV series built around the zombie apocalypse, there's no way in hell ABC, CBS, NBC, or FOX would ever put something like this on the air, maybe that is why they are bleeding viewers?

I loved the way this series jumped right into the action: Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, in a coma after being wounded in the line of duty, wakes up in a seemingly deserted hospital, surrounded by rotting corpses, lined up row upon row. He quickly learns from another survivor that while he was out, a plague has ravaged humanity, wiping out civilization and ushering in a new Dark Age more horrific than any worst case scenario: the dead have risen to devour the living and their numbers seem endless.

But this in not a story centered on the zombies, it is very much about the human characters and the price they must pay to survive: how they must try and hold onto their humanity when death is coming for them day and night.  After a while, you wonder if the title isn't referring to the zombies, but to the living, now making their way in a world where survival simply may not be worth it.

This sounds pretty damn bleak, but it's terrific storytelling.  I am a sucker for a great end of the world tale, and I took notice that in every episode the natural world is presented as lush and green, full of bright sunshine, a perfect contrast to the horror in its midst.

There are some great scenes, especially Rick's arrival in Atlanta and his confrontation with an army of zombies in episode one; same thing for the nocturnal zombie attack at the end of episode four.  There are also plenty of quiet moments where characters are allowed to develop, some may think this slows the show down, but they add the depth needed to make the violent moments hit with a harder punch.

Yes there is gore, but it's not over the top, nobody is trying to outdo George A. Romero.  We are shown what is necessary to drive home the horror of the situation.  And the acting is terrific, especially newcomers Andrew Lincoln as Rick and Jon Bernthal as his partner and best friend, Shane, who shares a guilty secret with Rick's wife.  Jeffry DeMunn and Steven Yuen are standouts in the supporting cast, while Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus shine as a pair of redneck brothers.

And all praise to Robert Kirkman, whose comic book, THE WALKING DEAD,is what the series is based on.  My biggest complaint, the season is way too short at only six episodes.  At least they leave us wanting more; can't wait until season two.",1317427200,3,2836,4.354838709677419

I recently re-watched all of these episodes in one night on these 2 Blu-Ray discs and all I can think was that buying this was well worth the price. Some extras on disc is a welcome addition too.

Visual quality is superb.

Audio quality is superb. Note: This is in 5.1 channel audio. This is likely due to the fact the show was recorded for HD Cable Television, which as far as I know is as high as broadcast HD television has as of yet.

4293527,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"THE WALKING DEAD is an exciting, innovative and very original series.  High kudos to AMC.  THE WALKING DEAD takes the zombie theme and brings it to a brand new level with intense drama and characters with depth and feeling the viewer can relate to.  The show sucks you in from the first second of the pilot.  And rest assured, there is blood and guts and gore galore but even with how great those scenes are it is the rest of the show that rules.  The story is more about the survivors.  It is thru their stories and interpersonal relationships that the heart and also true suspense and drama of the show lives.

The blu ray is amazing.  The video presentation is superb.  The picture is intentionally a little grainy which adds to its effect while the clarity and sharpness of the picture brings everything to life.  Colors are bright and realistic.  Close-ups are very crisp and flesh tones very realistic.  The scenes with the dead are mezmerizing as the colors of their lifeless walking bodies mesh with the realistic blood and gore in the action sequences.  And the audio is also superb.  Dialogue is strong and the menacing scenes come to life utilizing all surround speakers.  It's a whole other dimension from watching it on tv or dvd.  Bottom line, this is a scary zombie series that comes to life due to the heart and soul of the human characters.  It is about survival, love, acceptance and trust.  Writing and directing are of course superb.  Highly recommend this series and the blu ray transcends it to a new level.",1316476800,10,1529,4.617100371747212

If you are already familiar with the show, chances are you are already a huge fan.

As an overly critical and discerning enthusiast of the genre, I am generally not quick on the trigger when it comes to giving my approval to zombie films.  Nonetheless, The Walking Dead is an epic series, masterfully weaving the stereotypical elements one comes to expect from great zombie films with a fresh and surprising, almost giallo-esque focus on the very human side of the characters, often neglected in similar works.  The Walking Dead works almost as a cross-genre series, offering all the gore and action zombie fans expect, while also offering a deeper glimpse into the complex and well-constructed characters as they make their way through an apocalyptic world in which danger is lurking just around the corner at all times.  There is a very personal feel to this series which I find to be a  refreshing take on what has become a rather tired and played-out formula.  If you love zombie films, this series is a must.  If you are not a huge fan of the genre, this series just may be the one that brings you in.  I highly recommend this one.",1315872000,,1230,4.662037037037037

I have never been very drawn to comic stories, but this graphic novel series has completely changed my views and I am hooked!  I can't wait for the new season on October 16th!

4293538,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was afraid to see how they would mess up the comic and when I saw the mistakes they actually worked out in the end. I liked the different way they started it because it's still in the essence of the comic where the zombies aren't the main focus they are just the backdrop. Speaking of which these zombies are the most realistic zombies I have seen. They can't exactly run due to coordination issues but they aren't exactly slow either they just kinda stumble and shamble towards you. And the greater the number the scarier they are because all of a sudden you are completely surrounded. So it gets the terrifying aspect of the zombies but that's not what you are watching most of the time. It's more focused on characterization and a kind of ""how far would you go to save yourself"" situation but it's not just you which is what we normally think about. There's family still living with you in this ""world ruled by the dead"" like your wife or husband maybe child or grandparent what if it was your best friend the one person you thought you could trust to have your back no matter what. How would this change the group dynamic on who is on whose side?

4293542,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I enjoyed ""The Walking Dead"" more than I thought I would.  Who ever thought there would be a TV series like this?  This is a very unusual show, which could be the reason I liked it so much - almost refreshing.  If you are a ""hard core"" zombie fan, you may not like it as there are many things you could pick apart.  If you scare easy, this show may not be for you.  I, on the other hand, really like Zombie flicks (even though they scare me - I just don't like the idea of zombies!).  Remember, people react to things differently.  I thought the Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead were terrifying and I had nightmares for a month.  Some of my friends thought it (the Exorcist) was hysterical and giggled through the whole thing.  Now, that stupid movie ""Candy Man"" scared my friends to death, but I thought it was so dumb that I couldn't even sit through the whole thing.

I realize this is a TV show and not a movie, but I wish they would have established the characters just a little bit more in the first couple of shows.  I understand that we will ""get"" all the characters as the show goes forward.

Based off of a comic book by the same title, AMC hosted this series, and prior to it's airing, it had a lot of underground hype... and for good reason!  I was worried that being on a station like AMC, that The Walking Dead would go unnoticed, but I was surprised by just how many of my friends were raving about this series while it was on the air at the time.

I have to admit that my husband is a ""zombie fan"", me, not so much. I have been dragged into watching many a zombie movie, some better than others.  However, this series was one that I could really sink my teeth into! Excuse the pun. For my husband, the series had everything he wanted, scary zombies leaving you on the edge of your seat.  He's a military cop, and so he enjoys all that survival stuff, and fighting zombies.. whatever. For me, it had superb plot and character development. I think you got the most realistic look at what it would really be like to live in a post apocalyptic world. That maybe you'd want to all gang together with people, but those people wouldn't necessarily be *nice*, that they'd all have their flaws, that they'd all be under stress and not as cooperative as you'd like. There's of course conflicts between characters, heart warming friendships, love-triangles, and every episode ends on a cliff hanger.

This is a great DVD to add to your collection. You'll definitely want to lend it out to anyone who was unfortunate enough to have missed it when it aired on TV.  And of course, when Season 2 airs, you'll want to refresh your memory of Season 1!  This is my all time favorite of the zombie genre.",1313625600,,1852,4.413489736070381

The first season comes with two discs, the first having episodes 1-4 or 5, and the second disc has 2 episodes on it and special features. I haven't watched the special features yet so I can't comment on them, but at $20 or so, this is a very good price for such an amazing show (and for it being a blu-ray as well!). There isn't any extended episodes that I'm aware of so don't purchase it thinking there will be more to the show.

4293553,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I resisted this series when I first heard about it last year mostly because zombies are as overplayed as story/characters these days as vampires are - I was just jaded to hear about more zombies. Also, a guy waking in a hospital after an injury to see the world has changed - ""28 Days Later"" anyone? That said, a slow weekend made me pick up the box set and give it a go. I was wary for the first 45 mins of the pilot, thinking that if it didn't get better soon I'd put the set on eBay and try something else but oh boy did things get better quick!

The final 30 mins of the pilot is outstanding, gut busting action as Deputy Grimes enters Atlanta on a horse with a gun slung across his back and a bag of guns behind him only to find the city infested and riddled with zombies. What follows is one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen. Grimes is repeatedly just making it out of reach of the ""walkers"" (as they're known in this series rather than ""zombies"") and he's forced into smaller and smaller spaces, making it out just in time! By the end of the pilot, I was hooked. I had to know how he got out of the way he ends up.

From there on in it's a mixture of that tremendous action and the introduction of a motley crew of survivors. Standouts for me were Grimes and his partner (who share an awkward and untold secret) and the belligerent redneck brothers who come to blows more often than not even as they evade the hordes.

The series constantly turns conceptions around in the episodes. A group of renegade Latino gangbangers? Think again. A kindly professor offering safe haven? Think again. While a couple of episodes are kind of slow, focusing instead on developing the characters' backgrounds more and including flashbacks to before the world ""turned"", the majority of episodes here are excellent and the zombie action is among the best the genre has produced. You never know who's going to make it and who's going to get bitten and that makes for some great twists and turns along the way as the survivors run from one location to the next, hoping for respite somewhere.

The series ends with a literal bang and I was left thinking that it deservedly was given the title of ""best series of 2010"". Fantastic action, great acting, among the most gross and realistic zombie makeup you'll ever see - can't wait for Season 2 out later this year!",1312761600,,2358,4.401376146788991

I can not wait for season two.  So refreshing to see something this awesome on TV.,1312329600,,255,4.122448979591836
4293555,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The primary thing that has always set this amazing zombie story apart from all the rest is that its primary focus has always been on the people and their trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in this nerd-fantasy, post-zombiepocalypse world. If you haven't read the still-ongoing comic series, it also comes highly recommended, but has only ever meant to serve as a basic guide for the direction of the show and there should be no surprise that the live action version holds some ""detours"" from the comic - some extremely creative ones I might add.

There's no shortage of zombie tension in this six-episode season 1 (that was actually meant to be just the pilot, but went a little long), some good cliffhangers, and there's certainly plenty of character drama with this group of survivors surrounded by death.

If you're looking for a non-stop action, zombie kill-o-rama, this may not be what you want; but if you're looking for an extremely well told story of survival based on an amazing comic series with plenty of gory zombie goodness, then you cannot go wrong with The Walking Dead. And with season 2 coming in mid October 2011, now's the time to get caught up with the story.",1311984000,4,1196,4.7451923076923075
4293556,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I got the product pretty fast.  I only saw a few episodes, due to being overseas.  When the season came in, I was surprised how few episodes there were and the focus on non zombie issues.  I was also surprised to see the lack of zombie interaction with the characters and how the series was more focued on living human interaction.

There were times in many of the episodes where it seemed the actors were only on a camping trip, or marooned on a tropical island, rather than living in a world overridden by zombies.  I'm more into the zombie on your tail, constant fighting to survive, destroying hordes of zombies type genre.

With that being said, it was awesome to see one of my favorite book genres playing out on a television series.  The zombie scenes and action was as gruesome as expected.  Though the focus is on the actors mainly, and how they deal with the outbreak, I do enjoy seeing how they cope with their situation and keep on surving.  I am going to watch and buy season 2, and I hope it's more action packed than season 1.  I'd love to see episodes showcasing the first few weeks of the zombie outbreak, the government/military trying to contain it, and seeing the society break down to how you see it now in the series.",1311638400,,1239,4.418502202643172
4293557,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"So,how is The Walking Dead. Well, it's quite good realy. Now if you read the graphic novel be prepared for some liberal departures from the source material. There is alot that made it into the show from the graphic novel but much is close but slightly different. At other times entire episodes are simply fabricated out of thin air. Enough, about that though let's get down to brass tax.

It's made for TV so don't expect Hollywood special efects with a Hollywood price tag. That being said not every zombie is all that great but at times they are down right spot on. Lets not forget we are talking about an end of the world zombie apocaolypse with roving hordes of extras made up to look like the undead. Most shows to attempt this would skimp on the budget and fall flat. Not the case with The Walking Dead it largely delivers.

Violent. It is at times very violent. Fire axe to the melon complete with messy splatter. Yep, that's in there.

That Walking Dead is not a never ending canabalistic splatter fest. It's about humans pushed to the limit and all the best and worst of our nature: the brave and the cowardly, the merciful and the cruel, hope and despair, friendship and loss.

The acting is solid on almost every account. A couple of characters are a bit thin. (Maybe they will be zombie fodder in Season 2.) The writing is good as well. No idiots going off to look for noises in the woods at night stuff.

So, effects are good, violent, has a soul, decent characters, avoids being too campy, and it's the end of the world with zombies.

I'm in! If you like zombies then you should be too. If not well, I think there is like 50 vampire shows on. So....yeah.....have fun....with...that.",1311552000,,1696,4.490259740259741

4293559,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"After hearing all of the rave reviews for AMC's 'The Walking Dead', my expectations were rather high. I am pleased to report this DVD collection didn't let me down. It is easily one of the best series I've seen in quite some time. From the 90 minute pilot episode to episode 6's dramatic conclusion, 'The Walking Dead' grabbed my attention in its gnashing, rotting teeth and didn't let me go! The production quality is more like that of a movie; as is the levels of gore, violence and mature content. However, these are not extraneous and only serve to further the plot.

As you've probably heard by this point, 'The Walking Dead' is a story where most of the population has become zombies and there are groups of ragtag survivors trying to find some answers and survive as best they can. It has a horror theme, but it is more of a human drama than anything else. The zombies serve as a plot device to test the character of the main players, exposing their strengths as well as their flaws. The casting is spot on and the characters believable and relatable. The second of the two DVDs has a lot of behind-the-scenes / making-of extras and I was surprised to learn that the lead actor who plays police officer Rick Grimes is British. Andrew Lincoln becomes the Georgia law man so thoroughly, you'd never guess. The rest of the ensemble is equally convincing in their varied roles.

The Walking Dead is will probably not please all viewers. The level of explicit violence is pretty high, though appropriate considering the subject matter. People stop being nice and do what they have to do to survive when civilization breaks down (I hope I never find out). There are some scenes where the story's continuity breaks down but nothing too detracting. And there is only 6 episodes - I'm left wanting more! Well, season 2 is due to begin in about 3 months and this time we get 13 episodes. I'm tempted to wait for it to come out as a set though. Watching all of a season 1's shows back-to-back was just too engrossing of an experience. Here's hoping producer/writer/director Frank Darabont, the cast and the crew are able to maintain this high level of quality and perhaps even kick it up a notch!

4293561,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I absoloutely love horror films, and to be more specific I love zombie movies. But, with every zombie movie, it must end.. or it just gets dragged on, IE Resident Evil.

If you're in my shoes, trust me you will LOVE this series. It is simply amazing. Just as a little FYI this series is based off the comic books The Walking Dead created by Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore.

First off, I love the characters, and I also love that their story is unpredictable. In a movie you can basically tell who is going to live and who is going to die. In this series its up in the air; if there is any one character you expect to live you may be surprised. Not to mention the fact that they're all really great actors. My favorite characters are Rick Grimes, whom the story primarily focuses on (played by Andrew Lincoln.) His journey into this new world overtaken by zombies begins in a hospital bed. He has been neglected after a gun shot wound, and walks out into the real world to find everything he loves is gone. Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) is another character to watch out for. He's a military vet, and is handcuffed to a metal pole as impending doom is knocking at his door (literally.) Don't worry though, he finds a way to survive... by removing his own body part. And finally you have Glenn (Steven Yeun) who provides comic relief to the characters as they are enduring the Zombiecolypse, haha

Another thing to watch for: the zombies themselves. My fiance and I agreed the zombies in this series are probably one of the best special effect make-up we've ever seen. They truly are a work of art, something you have to see for yourself. Not to mention the fact that the zombies must be killed by destroying the brain, and the show spares no expense showing the viewers the gruesome scenes.

This isn't your typical zombie movie. These people are trying to survive during the zombie attacks... and just when you think they're safe.......... well, see for yourself :)

The only negative that I have about this series is that it is wayyyy too short. This is normally why I only purchase series when I know they are done filming, and I can buy a complete set... and not have to wait until October 2011 to see what happens! (Even longer actually, we don't have TV out here so I have to wait until it comes out on DVD.)",1310860800,,2318,4.431924882629108

4293564,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"AMC is already home to two of the most critically acclaimed and popular series on television (Mad Men, Breaking Bad) but the network's latest addtion may be its finest yet.  The Walking Dead is an invigorating update of the zombie/apocolypse genre adapted from the graphic novel series created by Robert Kirkman.  Don't worry though, you don't have to have read any of the comics in order to appreciate this gripping and emotionally charged drama.  Chances are that The Walking Dead will appeal to fans of zombie flicks as well as fans of great television.

Produced by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) The Walking Dead's six episode freshman season follows a group of survivors in the wake of a world wide viral breakout that has turned its victims into an army of mindless, flesh craving corpses referred to as ""walkers"".  The series follows the small but closely knit group as they struggle to stay alive and find any sign of hope for the future of the human race.  The action is often gory and wince inducing, and Darabont and his creative team have constructed an excellent milieu of desolation and decay--particularly when the action shifts to the streets of Atlanta.  But what keeps you watching and coming back for more is the human element.  Each of the characters is painfully human with shortcomings and fears aplenty.  Viewers will likely find themselves at turns aggravated and inspired by the selfish and selfless actions of the cast.

There may only be six installments of this first season, but that is more than enough time for The Walking Dead to develop into a fully realized drama with complex characters, gripping suspense and a undeniable sense of dread.  The season finale in which the survivors take refuge inside the CDC in Atlanta is a telling example of just how dire things are and how steeply the chips are stacked against them.  The will to survive may be the only thing that keeps them moving forward.  And what are they moving towards?  We'll have to wait for season two for answers to that question.  Let the countdown begin.",1310428800,,2083,4.828169014084507

What we have here is a fascinating insight into the interpersonal relations between a ragtag band of survivors that borders on an anthropological study that would have made Margaret Mead proud.  Yes, The Walking Dead gives us some of the best undead special effects and terror that I have seen since the classic remake of Dawn on the Dead, but the main focus of the series zones in on how the human animal acts and reacts when taken out of his/her comfort zone. Unlikely heroes rise to the occasion alongside standard villains.

Police officer Rick Grimes is shot an wakes up some time later in a hospital bed.  The only problem is that the hospital is empty.  Rick goes through the hospital in a daze unable to comprehend what he is seeing.  When he leaves, there are pile after pile of dead bodies.  With no one around, Rick heads home only to find it deserted.  His wife and son have vanished.

Rick is found by Mogan Jones and his son Duane.  Morgan gives Rick a lesson in Zombie 101.  Morgan tells Rick that people were told to go to Atlanta.  Rick decides to go to Atlanta in hopes of finding his family.  But what Rick does not know is that Atlanta has been overrun by walkers (their term for zombies).

Just outside of Atlanta is a group of survivors headed by Rick's partner Shane.

As episode one ends.  Rick is stranded in a tank in Atlanta surrounded by walkers.

Episode two -  Rick is stranded in a tank but then he hears a voice over the radio.  With the voice's help, he escapes and we meet another part of the survivor group.  The downside of Rick's rescue is that the walkers are alerted to the humans and they become trapped in a department store.  Through some ingenuity, Rick is able to save all but one of the survivors.

Episode three - Bad boy Merle is still handcuffed to the roof of the store with the walkers try to break down the door.  Rick and the rest of the department store survivors return to camp.  To Rick's surprise, two of the survivors are his wife and son.  What he doesn't know is that his wife and his partner Shane have hooked up. A rescue mission to save Merle is mounted but all they find is his severed hand.

Episode four - Since Merle escaped, now they are trying to get the guns that Rick lost in the street.  But even that goes wrong when they encounter a new group of survivors who have as ecret of their own.  Back at the camp, things are breaking down.  When things lighten up over a fish fry, the camp is attacked by walkers.

4293573,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"What is it about Zomebies that makes them so appealing nowadays? As one that loves the classic monster movies, Zombies are the new kids on the block. They became a hit with the cult-classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968. Back then, Zombies were reanimated dead people that had an insatiable craving for human brains. They were slow fumbling ""simple"" folk. As other people made Zombie movies, each writer, director, and producer added their own twists on what it was to be one of the undead. Of crouse the biggest inside joke was that in all the movies, they are never called ""Zombies"".

Today, Zombies have a cool factor about them. They have even starred in extremely hilarious cult movies such as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Fido. Now the cable channel AMC has brought back an entirely new Zombie story and for the first time, they are at the heart of an episodic television show. The first season of ""The Walking Dead"" was truly landmark TV and something TV viewers are so desperate to have. It's unique, compelling, and highly entertaining. My only lament is that the first season was only six episodes long.

So what makes it so special? Well for one, like all good science fiction, it's about the human condition and our society set in a fantastic fictional setting. A sheriff is shot in action and slips into a coma. When he wakes up, the hospital has become a wild abandoned haunted house with things that go bump in the night locked behind chained doors. When he gets up and gets out, he discovers his home town almost deserted. He makss a bee line to his home where he discovers his wife and son have packed up thier most precious belongings and fled, He then meets a man and his son that have been surviving the ""zombie-pocolypse"" that bring him up to speed on what's gone on. There has been a deadly virus that once it kills you, it reanimates your body into a mindless flesh-eater. The rumor has it a lot of people have fled to nearby Atlanta for sanctuary, so our Sheriff goes to his local precinct, loads up for bear, and heads for Atlanta. Once there, he meets up with a reg-tag band of survivors and this is where the great dynamic begins.

The survivors are a cross-section of Americana, complete with all its flaws. The only thing they have in common is that they want to survive. This is what makes Walking Dead stand out amoung all the other zombie stories. It reminds me of what I thought made the recent version of Battlestar Galactica so great. Its not about the Zombies, its about the human condition. The Zombies are there to present an on-going crisis that compells tha central characters on to confront their frailties and issues. The stories and scripts are so well written, I am going to be quite upset if this off-beat show is not nominated for an Emmy for its writing.

Also, it's writers are not afraid to take risks and just like Battlestar, everyone is at risk. People die and they have made it quite clear that no one, even its central characters, are safe from death or zombification. Another thing I quite liked is that so much was packed into these six episodes, it seems like a series that had twice the number of episodes. The pacing is extrordinary and while it's never overpwoering, it moves at a brisk pace. Also, when the last scenes have played out in the final episode of the season, it is a great ending that not only leaves the door open for Season 2, but it clears the slate so that anything can happen.

This is must-see TV and I highly reccommend anyone that can get past the concept of Zombies to watch this series. I can not wait until Seaosn 2 airs.",1309046400,,3621,4.505327245053272

That said, the extras leave a lot to be desired. First, it seems like after every menu selection there's a splash screen that states ""Walking Dead Season 2 coming this fall"". It gets old quickly, and will be completely useless once season 2 starts.

Second, the featurettes are split into two different screen sections, and I'm not sure why because they seem to be pretty similar to each other. Also, in my world, ""extra footage"" means cut scenes, but in this set it means ""behind the scenes"" features.

So, terrific show, but the extras aren't presented logically, and the splash screens both waste time and are maddening because they'll be obsolete soon.

4293582,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead combines traditional zombie horror genre with traditional soap opera, gives 'em a good shake, and adds a dab of sci-fi for the topping. It's all good -- for those of us who love zombie movies, good old soap opera drama, and sci-fi.

The ""high concept"" here is the mix of different genres. The zombie genre has evolved to often include some reference into sci-fi -- the question, ""Okay, I understand the dead are now walking around eating people -- but, uh, WHY are they doing that, exactly?"" (The answer, of course, is always something like ""Dr. X mixed the Reanimator serum with the Godzilla Virus, and now it's gone airborne!"")

Oh. That explains it.

The weirdo bogus science aside, this series delivers with atmosphere -- the large-scale scenes of deserted streets are more chilling than the scenes of seemingly endless wrecked cars. The gore is not excessive, but it's definitely there -- even if there wasn't a ""need"" to satisfy gore fans, it's still a realistic part of the plot: dead people walking around, looking to kill living people - something bad WILL happen.

Toss in the tear-jerkers, the messy relationship, and some characters that we can almost but not quite care about, and it's a wrap! It works as a basic thrill flick with some poignant scenes here and there -- it has a bit of trouble (doesn't every movie and TV series?) at times, having an especially bumpy ride due to the lack of any message or central thematic note.

But it gets there. Despite the bumps, the ride gets to its destination, and you wanna be there when it does.",1308096000,4,1570,4.673913043478261

If you go into this wanting ""horror"" made for TV, you will be disappointed as this is not necessarily a ""scary"" TV show for someone who has seen movies like 28 Days Later, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead etc. (It would be scary for those who possibly don't watch this genre normally or younger children though) This series is honestly a far cry from those types of movies and to me is closer to something like Stephen King's The Stand in feel. The filming is done with the people at the center of the series rather then the zombies and follows them as they decide how to live in and cope with a world where the dead walk. If you are someone who is into films or television with an Apocalyptic type theme, you should really enjoy this series as it does get you thinking of how you would respond and what you would do in these circumstances. The filming is generally gritty and was very well done and does put you into the middle of what the people are going through and that combined with a wonderful cast that really draws you in is what makes this really special. All in all, a great compliment to the genre, intelligent, thought provoking and well written. Can't wait for Season 2! :O)",1308096000,2,1393,4.2965779467680605

The Walking Dead has been a welcome departure from this formulaic mediocrity. The writing is crisp and it flows fast. The actors and actresses are taking their craft seriously. It is supurbly well directed. What they have done is set out to make a quality product and they have hit a home run.

The Walking Dead set ratings records. They did it by creating a quality product and approaching their subject matter seriously.

4293589,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I'm not a big fan of the comic series this is based on; don't get me wrong, I read a lot of it and enjoyed a fair amount, but after a certain point all the tragedy started to feel more comical than dark the more it was piled on, and I had to quit. The narrative at times just felt like it was too big for its chosen medium, and the characters I cared about were vastly outnumbered by the characters who I couldn't care less for because they didn't get enough ""page time"" to really develop.

What I was most surprised by was how good the television series is at making characters the comic had painted as villains believable and sympathetic. While Comic-Shane was little more than a mentally unstable lumbering brute, TV-Shane comes across as a still unstable but very lonely man torn between his loyalty to his best friend and his own desires. Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori does an absolutely amazing job of turning a character I previously felt was little more than a shrill, selfish, hateful witch into a strong, conflicted woman I genuinely cared about and felt bad for. Andrew Lincoln does a good job as Rick Grimes, although he hasn't really had a chance to do much beyond look determined/horrified, and Steven Yeun is supremely enjoyable as fan-favourite Glenn. Carol's character gets a drastic overhaul as a badly abused wife (or at least her husband is present here where he was absent in the comic), but I feel it gives her some sorely needed perspective and character development that her often seemingly emotionally (and maybe mentally) unstable pen-and-ink incarnation lacked.

It does disappoint in some places. Too many of the new characters are utterly unforgettable to the point that deaths that are supposed to be tragic just come across as ""meh"", and while the violence is mature without being sadistically gory, I felt like the narrative let me down in a few places that it deviated from the source material. One character, for example, is significantly older than they are in the comic, and I have a feeling that it was a decision that was made solely to make the May-December romance that pops up less ""weird"" to the viewing audience, which was a bit of a disappointment when the comic managed to portray it in an honest, mature fashion.

But while the story does deviate drastically from the source material in a way that will probably enrage die-hard comic afficianados, the television incarnation of The Walking Dead manages to be that rare beast that balances action and horror with genuine, believable human drama without one ever really getting in the way of the other. The season finale is a bit over-the-top in that it strays a bit too far into formulaic sci-fi disaster movie territory, but at this point, I have put my trust in the cast and crew to deliver. Highly recommended.",1307232000,4,2806,4.710794297352342

4293591,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Zombies are my favorite sub genre of films out there, though it is a rather shallow pool when you talk about the really good ones, and I'm not saying that there haven't been really good ones made since the 70's, because there definately have.  From Faluci, to 28 days later, to the over the top Dawn remake, to even some of Romero's new projects, but there just seems to be a gap between how good I think it can be with how good it ends up being.  This movie juggles a very fine line and manages to be one of if not the best shows currently on tv, and I hear that from all kinds of people, not just zombie fans.  The source material for this is a graphic novel, and though I have to say that I am not a fan of comic books, the writing really takes center stage.  Romero once said that the real bad guy of his films was not the zombies, but that they acted as a catalyst for humans to be their base selves as society depreciates, and that is at the cornerstone of what makes this series so great, but not from a cynical point of view, but from the heartfelt perspective of someone who believes they can change society for the better, and show that life is worth living to his son.  I don't want to give away the finer points to the show.  I can tell you that it is not a zombie attack of the week, which makes when the zombies do show up in mass all that much more exciting of a surprise, because of the lulling of feeling you are safe from all the human interest pieces.  There just happens to be zombies about.  This has more in common with High Noon than your average zombie fair, not to say that there is not some desensitized gore in there, but series lead Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile is a master of blending human and horror elements.

The prosthetics are outstanding looking convincing enough to make one queasy. On the whole though the balance is well handled, it is after all a prime time thriller and it does deliver.

4293595,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Rick Grimes, a sheriff in a small Georgia town, is shot during an altercation and ends up in a coma. Waking up weeks later, he finds the hospital abandoned and corpses everywhere. He quickly discovers that the country is overrun by the walking dead. Rick sets out to find his missing wife and son, hoping they made it to the promised 'safe zone' in Atlanta, but finds that the city has fallen. But there are other survivors out there...

Based on Robert Kirkman's comics, The Walking Dead is essentially a zombie movie that 'never ends' (or at least will go on much longer than any zombie movie or even series of zombie movies). Frank Darabont, the much-feted director of The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, has applied his writing and directing skills to Kirkman's comic to create something quite impressive.

The Walking Dead's opening episode is bleak and cinematic, with Rick's predicament ably transmitted through Darabont's claustrophobic direction and Andrew Lincoln's superb performance as Rick. Lincoln, a Brit best-known for his comedic role in Teachers, plays Rick's frustration, fear and concern for his missing family to perfection. The first episode, with Rick alone against the zombie hordes, is arguably the best, but the remainder of the short first season, which sees Rick link up with a band of survivors outside Atlanta, is only a notch down in quality.

The rest of the first season concerns itself with the survivors arguing over what to do next and explores the dynamics of the group. Rick's old cop partner Shane has been leading the group, but finds himself supplanted by Rick, which leads to some tension. Two of the other members of the group are racist thugs, setting up tension with the black and Hispanic members of the group, whilst another survivor takes out his frustrations and anger with the situation on his wife. It's not a happy group, and the writers and directors do a good job of exploring the characters and their interactions whilst remembering to bring the zombies on every once in a while to cause mayhem.

Production values are extremely high. The zombie effects are great (a couple of them are obviously fake heads over ordinary people's faces, but these are very rare), up there with the best movies, whilst Atlanta (population 5 million, including the surrounding area) looks convincingly abandoned and bleak. There's a couple of ropey CGI explosions, but beyond that, The Walking Dead looks and feels like a big-budget movie.

The story unfolds at a pretty good pace, though there's a couple of divergences in the second half of the season and a few moments of possible wheel-spinning. However, given that one of the appeals of the story (in both comic and TV form) is that it has the time to show such side-plots and explore the fall of America to a zombie horde in greater detail than a film or novel, that's not an invalid thing to do. By the end of the season there's also a renewed sense of purpose, as the survivors realise that the CDC (Centre for Disease Control) HQ is in Atlanta and may have some of the answers they are looking for. This marks the biggest change from the comics, where the CDC is not mentioned, but as Robert Kirkman (who wrote the fourth episode of the series) points out that's only because he didn't know it was there. If he had, the comics would also have gone there. This sets up a number of interesting possible storylines for Season 2.

Season 1 of The Walking Dead (****) is a terrific, well-paced and well-acted post-apocalypse series. Let down only by a couple of meandering story threads, it's otherwise a great piece of television. The series is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1306454400,,3707,4.802507836990595

Distributor: Anchor Bay Entertainment (US)

Some of us have been waiting patiently for a full blown zombie television series for what seems like an eternity and finally after many years of rumours and speculation we finally get Frank Darabont's The Walking Dead.

So, would the wait eventually prove to be worthwhile? Actually, it probably was.

The series begins with the story of a police officer shot during his regular day to day activities, only to awake in hospital some weeks later to find that in the meantime the world he knew has simply gone to Hell, quite literally. The story progresses across 6 episodes and deals with a handful of survivors battling hordes of the undead whilst trying to find a safe haven and avoid becoming the next zombie meal. With a fair amount of character background which builds across the various relationships, the struggle for survival brings a decent amount of tension to the screen with characters that you will actually care for and a couple of reasonably well placed twists along the way to keep you guessing. The gore factor is also pretty high for a television series and the effects look altogether excellent throughout.

Worth noting in fact, is that the gore looked so realistic, that in all countries other than the original US broadcasts, edits have been applied to a couple of the episodes during their major gore scenes. This also remains true of the Blu-ray releases as every other version apart from this US disc contains the cut print, so if you want to see the full version of the episodes, you will be needing this US release from Anchor Bay. The only problem there being is that this disc is unfortunately locked to region A. More proof if any was required, that a region free Blu-ray player is the only way to go.

Anchor Bay have released The Walking Dead with an excellent 1080p 1.78:1 wide-screen transfer which looks fantastic. Detail is superb with colours and black levels enriching the performance. Having watched the original broadcasts, the Blu-ray looks to be on a different level and really immerses you into the story. With no print damage on display and enough grain to enhance the atmosphere and still give that home made quality, this really is the ultimate way to view the series.

Audio is also excellent. Presented with a True HD 5.1 soundtrack there is plenty here to grab your attention. From the moaning hordes of re-animated corpses to the bullet ridden showdowns, the audio drags you kicking and screaming into the action. Dialogue is clean and crisp, explosions are bassy and powerful and combined with the already classic music score, an altogether brilliant performance is delivered throughout.

Extras are also of an excellent quality, including The Making of The Walking Dead which provides a 30 minute documentary delving into various behind-the-scenes features and interviews with the cast and crew. Following this there are six mini featurettes which each focus on one particular episode in turn, behind the scenes make up tests, a producers Q&A session with a Comic-Con setting and a couple of zombie specific supplements. Rounding all of this off, there are also a couple of cast interviews and an on camera tour of one of the shows sets.

All things considered, this set is a must have for zombie fans everywhere and although some parts of the series share more than a passing similarity to films like 28 days later and modern day zombie remakes such as the Dawn of the Dead, the story here is both fun filled and gripping with more than enough new concepts to please all but the most demanding horror fan. With Season 2 beginning later this year, there is no better time to revisit the first season again, especially in its new enhanced presentation.

Although I have AMC I missed the broadcast showing of The Walking Dead so I was quite pleased to see it out on DVD.

The DVD features all 6 episodes of the first season of The Walking Dead.  The show does pretty well in a marathon or by splitting it up between the two discs. Either way you'll want to block out some time to watch this series as it is very addictive and it's hard to just watch one episode.

The Walking Dead plays more like a movie to start than a TV show and in the first half of the series the effects are top notch. The sheer number of people they have cast as zombies is impressive. The Walking Dead does very well when compared to other zombie films with great action, suspense and tons of gore.  On top of all that is a nice character driven story which holds together quite well with characters that you get to know and like.

I went into watching The Walking Dead after hearing a lot of hype around the series and often things just don't live up to that kind of hype. The Walking Dead absolutely lived up to the buzz, it's a fantastic show that I will definitely be watching when it comes back on air for Season 2.",1305676800,,1643,5.161654135338346
4293605,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I would not describe myself as a zombie fan.  That doesn't mean I don't occasionally get lured over to that territory through popular culture or a particularly irresistible bit of story-telling.  I have no cable television in my home, but even I'd heard enough buzz on The Walking Dead to be intrigued.  After all, it's the same network that brought us Mad Men, and I've been hooked on those DVDs for years.  Still, as scary as 60's-era advertising execs are, I wasn't sure I was prepared for zombies.  I called my buddy Jimbo and asked, ""Will The Walking Dead be too scary for me?""  His answer: ""Yes.  But you have to watch it anyway for the story-telling.""  As usual, Jimbo was right on both counts.

In the extended pilot episode, a Georgia sheriff's deputy is shot in the line of duty.  He eventually awakens, scruffily bearded, in the hospital after an unknown period of time.  He is still weak, bandaged, and disoriented.  Is he really awake at all?  Because he's awoken alone in a nightmare world.  The hospital is deserted, and there are terrifying signs of violence everywhere.  The morgue has been locked down tight, but there are... things behind the door.  Outside, he finds dozens of decaying bodies lined up like logs.  So begins Rick Grimes' odyssey in a wholly changed world.  Eventually he meets other survivors who explain that the dead have risen and who give Rick the basic info on this brave new world.  His only immediate goal is to survive and find his wife and son.

Enough can not be said about the quality of this television series.  From performances, design, special effects and makeup, writing, and direction, this series on the small screen rivals anything you'd see on the big screen.  I don't believe I've ever seen the horror genre treated with such respect and intelligence.  The Walking Dead won't appeal to a universal audience, but there is simply no denying how good it is.

The first season DVDs contain a mere six episodes, but they include a nice variety of DVD extras ranging from several making of-style documentaries to a how to achieve zombie makeup tutorial for Halloween.  I was disappointed by the lack of commentary tracks, but hopefully they'll be included next season.

Yes, Jimbo was right.  This show is way too scary for me.  I watched these episodes one at a time, with the lights on, and not before bed.  They truly scared me to the point that I could barely continue watching them.  I was cursing Jimbo the whole time and swore that I would not be watching season two.  But by the time episodes five and six were viewed, I knew it was hopeless.  I'm hooked.  I need to know what's going to happen next, but I dread finding out!",1305676800,32,2684,4.642553191489362

4293614,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I love this show.  I've been a fan of The Walking Dead since day one when I purchased the original books years ago.  Even though this show has some differences from the books, I still enjoy the program very much.  That is the reason why I jumped on season one at the $27 price here on Amazon for the Blu-ray version.

My reason for the four star rating has little to do with the content of the show, but rather is a complaint about the quality of the Blu-ray.  I watch this show through my PS3 in 1080p on an LG LCD TV, and I am disappointed in many scenes.  The video quality looks like the show was shot in improperly lit scenes with a Canon dSLR set on a high ISO.  There is way too much grain in the shots done in the forest or inside of rooms.  It is distracting and annoying to see this on a Blu-ray edition.  What makes it so frustrating is that in many shots, ones that are well lit, this issue does not exist.

Maybe I have unrealistic expectations in hoping for Hollywood film quality Blu-ray resolution from a TV show.  Even so, I think this is something that takes away from the quality of the presentation.  The difference between the price on the DVD and Blu-ray editions is about $5, so I would suggest someone who owns both go ahead and get the Blu-ray.  That said, I would like to see the difference between the DVD in an up-converting player (like my PS3) and the Blu-ray.

In spite of that minor complaint, I still love the show and can't wait for season two.",1304640000,,1478,4.213523131672598

4293616,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"This is the first time I've actually bought a TV series. Usually I don't bother shelling out the cash since I'd only watch it once, maybe a few exceptional episodes twice at most. But I had to buy this because, (a) a close friend kept raving about how well they adapted the graphic novel and (b) It's the Walking Dead. I wanted to watch it in pristine Blu-Ray quality, not some dinky grainy download version.

So, there. I bought it and you can obviously see, from the title, that I loved it haha. It's not exactly the same as the graphic novel but it comes pretty damn close. And the changes, in my own opinion, are for the better. I watched the special features and Kirkman (the creator of the comic) had a large hand in the production of this TV series, and it really shows.

For the die hard fans out there bemoaning the changes, I don't think change is always a bad thing. Put in perspective, it's a rare occasion that an artists gets a chance to revisit a work after its become a sensation and revise it. I don't think the changes have detracted from the quality one bit.

The only thing is, I wished it was a bit longer. I knew when I bought it that it would only be six episodes but still, I was left wanting more at the end.

Here in Australia we don't get a lot of the series you do in the US - I mean we were lucky to get Dexter from what I heard.

So I put in on in the morning while having breakfast on a day off. The missus comes in, says ""I don't want to watch this cr*p in the morning""
Well she was still sitting there toward the end of the first episode saying are they finishing it there? I want to see the rest of it!

So it even hooks the none genre people as well.

Personally, it's got enough slice and dice / story line to keep you interested and the character actors get you interested in the storyline. It's even got a few funnies thrown in

I really hope they make another series - 6 episodes was way too short!

There is more to The Walking Dead than your usual zombie movie. It's not just about the survival of the living, but there is a plot with sub-plots as well. The stories are character driven instead of the usual bloody fanfare. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of blood and gore for those seeking that as well. I won't give any spoilers, so all I am going to say is that if you like a good story no let me correct that, if you like a great story then this is for you. The quality alone is more than you would expect from a TV show. More, the actors are unknown but top-notch and sure to be seen in future endeavors just for their acting in this series. My only complaint, is that there are only 6 episodes. I truly found myself wanting more at the end of the six episodes. Season two should give us all that.

4293627,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season DVD has everything a TV collection ought to have, with only a few clich&eacute; DVD  flaws holding it back.

The Show: The AMC adaptation of Robert Kirkman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead/dp/1607060760/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead</a>&nbsp;comic hosts an accurate portrayal of the original series without being strictly faithful.  It follows Rick Grimes, a small town deputy sheriff who comes out of a coma and wanders into the Zombie Apocalypse.  Rick must find his wife and son while coming to terms with the end of the world as he knows it. The story asks the questions that a standard film lacks the time to address: What if these characters had to survive in this horrific situation forever? How would they survive? Where would they live? How would they get food? What would become of their humanity?  ""The Walking Dead"" is an excellent job portrayal of the human mind under extreme stress.  The prolonged storytelling forces the viewer to form stronger attachments to the characters than one would normally develop for your standard zombie lunch special.

""The Walking Dead"" also looks fantastic.  It's filmed as if it was a theatrical motion picture, so it looks awesome, and the writing is superb, too.  The result is a terrifying, heartbreaking, and thrilling experience. Watch out for the last episode on the disc. No spoilers here, but it's a MAJOR departure from the comic series, and it might throw some die-hard fans off.

The DVD: The disc and its menus are fairly standard.  An animated title screen shows off your options, with a second disk for Special Features.  All pretty standard, with English and Spanish subtitles. It's really nothing out of the ordinary, so that annoying little DVD standard is here too: advertisements.  In addition to the regular previews and ads preceding the menu, the second disc has an obnoxious surprise.  When I selected the ""Special Features"" menu, I had to click through a ""New Season Coming This Fall"" advert screen before moving on to the bonus content. Thanks.  I'm already watching the show. I have the DVD. I don't think I need to see an advertisement for the show I'm watching RIGHT NOW.  I can't wait to see this ad again in a few years, when it's outdated, and nonsensical.

Special Features: This collection has ten featurettes: one for each episode, a general ""making of"", make up behind the scenes, sneak peek with the comic author, and a convention panel. The TV trailer and six ""Extra Footage"" segments, which showcase the creative influences on the show, actor interviews, and so on, are also included.  Although it seems like much of this was previously aired on AMC, it's still a great collection of content for the hungry zombie fan, with enough peeks at the production process to satisfy your inner film nerd.

Overall, it's a great DVD - completely worth owning for any fan of the series - but I had to deduct one star out of five for the sake of that stupid, stupid in-menu advertisement.",1303862400,,3081,5.065346534653465
4293628,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The first episode of The Walking Dead left me with some doubts about the show, but by three episodes in, I was feeling a lot better about it.  While the show is set in a zombie apocalypse, much of the drama is focused around the humans, their relationships and their struggle to survive.  With a bit of retweaking, this show could probably be about a group or survivors in another type of disaster.  I don't mean to say that there isn't plenty of zombie antics, because there is.

At first, I thought that it'd be another show where character drama was stretched out over several seasons, but the writers actually seem to do the opposite.  Character tensions are resolved fairly quickly and new characters will come and go pretty often.  I think the pacing of the show is great.  The plot of season one though, could have been a bit more awesome.  It felt like the writers were on the verge on doing something really interesting, but kept holding back.  When they finally tried to do something great for the finale, it came across a little hokey and silly, if that's even possible for a zombie TV series.  I don't want to give too much away, but it felt like they missed a great opportunity to explain some of the backstory of the disaster to leave us on an intelligent cliffhanger and instead went with an overly dramatic ending.

The DVD set comes on two discs with four episodes on disc one and two episodes plus extras on disc two.  The extras are pretty good too: making of, inside ""The Walking Dead"", sneak peek, behind the scenes, convention panel, trailer, extra footage, interviews, etc.  Overall, I think it's a fun series to watch and I'll definitely be watching season two in hopes that they do something a bit more interesting.",1303776000,,1740,4.574193548387097

I picked this one from the Amazon Vine program for my husband.  He loves SciFi and Zombie movies.  We watched it together and for me it was a good storyline, but a bit too graphic.  The blood and gore was just too over the top for me and the scene with the horse...well, let's just say if it had not been on dvd I probably would have changed the channel.

My husband felt it was just like other Zombie movies where the humans are just trying to survive.  He thought the graphics and the settings were great (amazing actually) and he watched every episode.  He did think that the human aspect and the storylines that they had were pretty good and drew you in.  Basically it was a great emotional Human tale whose enemy just happens to be zombies.

I think another viewer said it best that the zombies are secondary to the human aspect.  This is a small group of people trying to survive, be a family, maintain order, and live with the threat of death constantly hanging over their heads.  I think that it is a great group of actors and they do a wonderful job of of portraying ordinary people whose lives have been turned inside out and now they are just trying to live day to day.

4293644,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I popped disk one of The Walking Dead into my dvd player figuring I would watch one episode before I went to bed.  Six episodes later I was very tired but very content after watching all of season one.  This is a great series and I can't wait for it to return to television this fall.

I had never heard of this series or the graphic novel upon which it is based.  I figured I would try it because I have liked end of the world stories/movies since reading A Canticle for Liebowitz (a 1960 post-apocalyptic novel by Walter Miller) as a young teen. Also, Shawshank Redemption, written and directed by Frank Darabont,  is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was intrigued to see Darabont was the writer and executive producer of The Walking Dead.

What got me hooked from the moment I started watching  were the characters. This is not a blood and guts horror movie with stereotypical characters used to take up time between action sequences.  This is a movie where well crafted characters, whose lives have been turned upside down because a virus has destroyed most of civilization, try to survive.

The series begins with Rick and Shane, two small town Georgia cops, talking about life and chasing a bad guy.  Rick is shot and wakes up from a coma to find an empty hospital full of bodies.  After realizing he is not dreaming he runs into Morgan and his son who let him know that a virus is killing people and turning them into zombies. The zombies then feed on living things including people.

One of the first really moving scenes was Morgan's dilemma over what to do about his wife who has contracted the virus. I won't mention any more for those who have not seen the series.

I found all six episodes extremely well written. For someone like me who is not into gore, I found the occasional literal blood and guts scenes (we are talking zombies here) necessary and by no means gratuitous. While I think you could have replaced the zombies with any other threatening creatures, I understand from watching the extras that this is based on  The Walking Dead graphic novel series, which has a big following. Clearly Darabont had great material to work with and from the extras I have learned that he is faithful to the Walking Dead series in many instances. I plan to read this series next.

If you like great acting, well crafted characters, exciting action scenes, fascinating character interaction, great dialogue and tons of suspense watch this series.  Plus you get some great zombies thrown in as well. I can't think of a better end of the world/survivor movie.

I keep using the word movie, instead of series, because I feel like I watched a movie.  In fact, in one of the extras that came with the series, Darabont explains that AMC told him that they wanted him to create something movie like.  As a result he shot on location when he could and he created this series as if he was creating a movie.

The series started with six episodes so that's all you get in season one. There are some good extras talking about how the series came to be and with interviews with cast, crew and Robert Kirkman who wrote the graphic novel.

The final episode was great. It ended with me wanting more but I also was pleased that it tied things up sufficiently for me to feel like the six episodes combined had a beginning, middle and end. The characters are still trying to figure out how to survive but I was not left with a cliff hanger, wondering for months until the series resumes, whether some key character was alive or dead.

I can't wait for more episodes. I eagerly await season two on DVD.",1303084800,,3601,4.507692307692308

I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I began the show not caring for the characters and by the end I was deeply engrossed in the character's lives and their outcomes. Not all of the characters affected me like the main four or so characters. The series centers around the survival of a group of people close to the Atlanta metro area. The group tries to survive the zombie apocalypse with occasional run ins with other human survivors that are also trying to survive.
The start of the series is fantastic with Rick Grimes, the main character, awakening in an abandoned hospital with zero survivors. The story only picks up more speed from here and continues into Atlanta and then the outskirts of Atlanta. There are only six episodes in the first season with thirteen slated for season 2 which starts in October 2011. This is a hard review to write because the story is so engrossing that I do not want to give away any spoilers, but from research I do know that the TV series does not follow the graphic novel's plot closely.
I enjoyed the story and can not wait for the second season. I would highly recommend this show to any person looking for a new series about human survival. This show definitely made me reflect on some things because the connection between families is very deep in this show. Highly recommend this show.",1302998400,,1492,4.529629629629629
4293648,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"AMC's The Walking Dead has every element that makes for a great new show. Based loosely on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead Books, this series takes you on it's own storyline with many different twists and turns. The direction is perfection with Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont sitting in the director's chair. Added to this talent is Gale Anne Hurd, who produced Aliens and The Terminator. The cast completes this award winning line up of writing, directing and producing, with Andrew Lincoln playing the main character, law officer Rick Grimes, his partner and best friend Shane Walsh played by Jon Bernthal, his wife Lori Grimes played by Sarah Wayne Callies, along with a great supporting cast.

Great performances by some of the supporting cast includes Morgan Jones played by Lenny James, Glenn played by Steven Yeun- a huge fan of The Walking Dead Books, Sisters Andrea played by Laurie Holden and Amy played by Emma Bell, Brothers Merle Dixon played by Michael Rooker and Daryl Dixon played by Norman Reedus and Dale played by Jeffrey Demunn. The characters make this show believable by contrasting their human flaws, courage and fears against the non emotional zombies.

The story begins with two law officers Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh going through their typical day in a town just outside of Atlanta. While stopping a car of gun toting thugs, Rick, the main character gets shot and after being in the hospital for weeks awakens to a nightmare world of the living dead- zombies. He's totally alone and has no idea where to begin to find out what's happened and where his family is. Following Rick through this challenging new world of zombie gore and the emotional torment he has of the people he may never see again, along with the few non zombie people he meets along the way makes for a great storyline that keeps you watching. I was quite surprised that this main All-American John Wayne type character Rick Grimes is in real life British. Andrew Lincoln does a tremendous job in playing law officer Rick Grimes.

There are only 6 Episodes in this first season of The Walking Dead:
1. Days Gone Bye
2. Guts
3. Tell It to the Frogs
4. Vatos
5. Wildfire
6. TS-19
Included are plenty of bonus materials:
Featurettes: Making Of The Walking Dead, Inside Episodes 1-6, Sneak Peak With Robert Kirkman, Zombie Make-Up Tips, Convention Panel and Trailer.
Extra Footage: Zombie School, Bicycle Girl, On Set With Robert Kirkman, Hanging With Steven Heun, Inside Dale's RV and On the Set With Andrew Lincoln.

Watching this first season of the contrasting zombie gore against the cast's bravery, courage, emotions and fears really makes for a great new series that you won't want to miss. With the complete breakdown of laws and rules, it's a survival of the fittest, and you will begin to wonder what is more dangerous, the zombies or human nature?

As a fan of the graphic novel series, I'm happy the TV series is pretty faithful to it so far, but that Mr. Darabont gives his own spin to things to keep you guessing. This is as it should be since a carbon copy would be pointless and boring if you knew exactly what to expect. AMC also deserves credit for allowing the amount of blood and gore that's shown, which keeps the carnage realistic since a zombie apocalypse ain't pretty. Big kudos to Greg Nicotero and his company for the great zombie makeup and special effects. I think this may be the first time I've actually ever rooted for humans over zombies.

I continued to watch episode after episode and couldn't stop until I was finished. It was created/directed by the same man who brought us classics like Shawshank Redemption (one of my all time favorites), The Green Mile, and The Mist. How can you go wrong with that?

4293659,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"The show gets five stars. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been mentioned here or by critics; the acting and writing are excellent, the show is well-produced and it is much, much more than just a zombie infestation. The character development and human emotion really take front stage here; the undead theme isn't the centerpiece of The Walking Dead by a long shot. Think of it more as a ""what would happen if the apocalypse came?"" type of survival scenario -- emotions running high, tempers flaring, people struggling to maintain their sanity after calamity. It's all very human, which allows the viewer to empathize with the characters on screen. This is a key element often missing from supernatural/horror stories and makes this show truly unique and exceptional.

On to the issue of this DVD's price. There's only 6 episodes (running time is approximately 290 minutes) and Amazon is currently selling the DVD for around $18 - $22 (MSRP: $40). It's fairly light on special features: you get a couple of commentaries/behind the scenes vignettes, a couple deleted scenes, and that's pretty much it. You can also turn on English or Spanish subtitles on the DVD and 5.1 audio (neither of which are available if you download the show from Amazon).

However, you can purchase this show -- minus the extras mentioned above -- through Amazon Video On Demand for $1.99 an episode or $11 for the entire season (if purchased all at once). Given that there's not much bonus content on the DVD, I knocked down the DVD's rating a star. Heck, you can buy all the episodes in HD from Amazon Video On Demand for $14 -- which is still less money than this DVD that runs in 480p.

Again, the show itself is easily five stars. The DVD, however, is not. It's a bit expensive for the amount of content you get, and it doesn't really come with any compelling extras to speak of. If you have a fast internet connection, I would simply buy the episodes from Amazon or another download service and save the $6 - $12. On the other hand, however, if you don't have a great connection, don't hesitate to buy this DVD -- this is one of the best shows on television today.

Update Apr. 23, 2011: Amazon's price is now $9.99 for the DVD. At this price-point, the DVD is definitely 5 stars (and is actually cheaper than the downloads). It would seem that the price on this title changes fairly often -- so check to see which is the better deal (DVD vs. downloads) and make your decision accordingly.",1302480000,2,2483,4.62358276643991

If you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch, especially in HD.  The sense of loneliness and stillness is constant.  There are tons of zombies, but they are probably the smallest part of this show.  Instead, it's how these survivors react to the zombies that will keep you coming back.  Another great thing about this show is that there is very little musical score to it.  This makes the show very quiet and still.  You can hear every footstep and every breathe which gets your heart racing because you don't know how close the next horde is or if they will be able to hear those footsteps.

After reading the comic books (which are excellent), it's safe to say that these are a departure.  There are some similarities and most of the time I knew approximately what was going to happen, but it also threw some screw balls at me which kept it from being boring.

If you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  You'll be glad you did.",1302480000,,1172,4.375
4293663,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"Some people have commented on this being a talk feast or soap opera. To be frank I get the impression that those viewers were 12 year olds. (I'm over 40). I have to admit that I am bit of a Zombie fan, but thats because I find zombies scarier than most other genre. The whole mindless uncaring flesh eating monster scares the hell out of me. My wife? Well she is less than entusiastic. But this is in fact the first time she has enjoyed a zombie fest. My Wife, my Daughter(16) and myself watched the whole thing over 2 nights. Everytime we finished an episode we had to watch another one. We enjoyed it so much we had to ration ourselves.

Why was it so good? Because the story or should I say the characters reactions were understandable and believable. You could identify with them. There was interesting drama. Lets face it the only story you can create in a zombie armageddon is about the survivors and their struggles. Zombies 24/7 over six hours would be boring. I am going to get series 2 when its released for certain.

Side comment, I live in Australia, thank god for amazon. The free to air television in this country is a joke. Addicted to reality tv and reruns, only pushs their audiences to DVD series purchases where you can view quality product without adds.",1302393600,3,1273,4.459227467811159
4293664,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"First off, I don't watch much TV and we don't even have cable television in our house, just cable internet. I never heard of this series until it was offered through the Amazon Vine program. Out of curiosity I ordered it, thinking I'd watch the first episode or two and formulate a review.

Well good thing there are only 8 episodes because otherwise I'd have spent a lot more time watching this instead of doing whatever I should have been doing. Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop because I had to see what was going to happen next.

You can get the basic plot details from the other reviews posted here. What I want to say is that I got addicted because of the quality of the plots and the acting - I became immersed in the series and felt like someone who was actually there with this small band of survivors, feeling constantly on edge because of the dangers to which they were exposed and also imagining a world in which something like this actually happened.

One thing I want to point out is that it is a very gruesome show - most definitely the scenes of violence and bloodshed are graphic and disturbingly real so if that kind of stuff bothers you, then I'd suggest watching something else. It's a virtual hackfest of blood spraying all over the place and body parts flying in all directions. This is not solely for shock value, though - it is just part of the overall experience of watching this series, and part of what I feel are very intelligently written and believably acted plots.

While I am not planning on getting cable television just to watch season 2, I am looking forward to the new season so that they can hurry up and release it on DVD.  I give it thumbs way, way up.",1302393600,,1702,4.390476190476191

4293668,1,B0049P1ZZQ,"I don't know if it's my bad luck, or my portable DVD player, but I ordered this, and it didn't work. The first time I ordered it, the first disc would load halfway. It got to the Anchor Bay logo and froze. I tried it a million times, only to discover the same result each time. I tested disc 2, and it wouldn't load at all.
I tried them on my laptop and on 2 other DVD players, but to no avail.

So I brought it to Amazon's attention, and they professionally and promptly issued a replacement set. But that set didn't work, either. This time, neither disc would load at all, on my portable DVD player, my laptop, or on a DVD player. So I sent the second set back. I am currently waiting on a refund to my account.

I'm sure it's a terrific show (the ads I saw on TV were quite impressive, and i noticed it seemed to have theatrical film special effects, which is fantastic considering it's a television program), but I am really dismayed at the product itself. I've been reading other reviews, and so far I seem to be the only person who's encountered this problem.

While it was so very gripping that I ended up watching all 6 episodes in a marathon, some of the melodramatic turns left me annoyed.

Keep in mind, I'm not one of those guys that say, ""Oh, they changed it, now it sucks."" I knew they had changed things before I started watching the series. Why would I watch it if it was just going to be a direct translation from the comic books? If I wanted to see it all again, I'd just reread my comic books. Some of the changes they made are reasonable. There are other survivors. That's okay. What makes the main characters so special?

It's just the racists, wife beaters, and dead wives that are a detriment to my enjoyment. It's acted well, but I see it all coming from a mile away. Plus, some of the main characters from the comic books are missing or different in varying degrees. Allen, Donna, and the Twins are missing, but they still might pick them up next season. Jim talks a good amount, where originally he was in a PTSD-style shock. And Carol (a favorite of mine) is very different.

I bought the Two-Disk DVD set and I'm happy with it. There isn't anything extra on the Blu-Ray version. Four episodes are on the first disk, then two more on the second disk, plus about 2-hours of extra features. If you think it's too much to pay $20 for 6 episodes, then think of it as a six-hour movie instead.

Well, they call them ""graphic novels"" because they are adults and don't want to admit they read comic books but still... RIGHT I didn't. I am not reviewing the comics. I am reviewing the series presented here on DVD and the last few episodes were very good with character development, but you get that on other shows. This show is touted as ""the first zombine show on television"" and it should emphasize the zombies far more. I know, to keep our interest we have to get to know and love the non-zombie regulars but don't forsake the zombies for 4/5ths of most episodes to build that non-zombie character development.

4293685,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The dead will walk, and boy do they ever.  A pitch-perfect adaptation of Robert Kirkman's Image Comics series, AMC's The Walking Dead is simply spectacular.  Georgia cop Rick (Andrew Lincoln) wakes up from a coma to find the world around him has gone straight to hell.  Flesh eating zombies are everywhere, but that doesn't stop Rick from searching for his missing wife Lori (Prison Break's Sarah Wayne Callies) and young son Carl (Chandler Riggs).  Unbeknownst to Rick however is that his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) has things well in hand, with things getting hot and heavy between him and Lori in the process.  Produced by Frank Darabont (director of The Mist, The Shawshank Redemption, and The Green Mile; and who also helms the pilot episode), The Walking Dead captures both the horror and human elements that make Kirkman's comic so good in the first place.  Deviations from the source material aside, this is the brilliant zombie epic we've been waiting years for.  It's scary, rightfully bloody, and features a wonderful cast that also includes Darabont regulars Jeffrey DeMunn and Laurie Holden as Dale and Andrea respectively, newcomer Steven Yuen who is excellent as Glenn, and memorable guest appearances from Norman Reedus, Michael Rooker, and Noah Emmerich.  While this first season's six episodes are based on the comic's first storyarc, things conclude in a very different manner than the comic, and it leaves things sitting on a powder keg for the upcoming second season.  Do yourself a favor, even if you've never checked out the comic, give The Walking Dead a try.

Even with AMC's record of producing high quality series & Darabont's previous works, I still worried because adapations almost never meet the calibre of the source material. Thank goodness my worries were for nothing.

The first season compromises of six episodes with the first one strong enough to be released on its own as a standalone movie. Some fans of the comic didn't like some of the changes made to the characters/plot but I think these changes didn't detract from the series at all.

The episodes are well written and boast a strong cast. Viewers who normally shy away from horror/zombie films shouldn't stay away from this. Yes, there is some gore (and of course zombies!) but the story is really about the human relationships in the time of utter devestation.

On one exceptionally slow day, I could find no ""make work,"" so I randomly selected a dvd to take a look at. The zombies must've been with me that day, for it wasn't more than a few minutes until I was hooked. I had no clue at the time who had produced it or on which cable outlet it appeared. I just knew it wasn't done on a shoe-string budget, nor was it appropriate for television (I wonder what time this program aired on AMC?). Incredibly, I actually found myself getting ticked-off when (much-needed) customers dared to enter my domain!

I finished watching the last episode the next day and, as soon as I got home that night, I went online to order the COMPLETE series. When I found out this was the ONLY one out of the dozen or so I ordered that just had one season under its belt, I almost blew a gasket.

At the risk of ruffling the feathers of the few who gave ""Walking Dead"" low marks, I'll say this: If you like zombie  movies, there is a 100% chance you will love this series. If you can't stand zombie movies, there is a far better than average chance that you will love this series! The acting is a-one. The subplots are intriguing. Direction is professional.

4293698,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"Humanity hasn't got a chance if these people are left.

There's terrific production values in this tv show, but super annoying major flaws of reasoning.

For example a group of survivors have made camp outside Atlanta. Only one of them carries a gun, and it's only a revolver (six shooter).

The camp consists of tents pitched anywhere. There's no sense of attempting to fortify themselves at all against attack. The tents are pitched well away from their vehicles. IF the zombies attacked they'd be wiped out in minutes

In a nation of major gun ownership the fact that only one guy has one gun with him is just stupid.

Second is the Sheriff's deputy - a survivor on the way to Atlanta.

He got a tiny petrol can - perhaps only 5 gallons. And that's it. Not even a back-up can.

He too walks around with a six-shooter, though sometimes he takes a shotgun out of the boot - what good it is there is beyond me.

I am amazed at this poor writing. Even if you watch ""The Colony"" a post-apocalyptic `reality show' they took with them more supplies.

The deputy, when he stumbles into the city and is surrounded by zombies makes his way into a abandoned tank. Does he try to use the weapons? No. Someone calls him on the radio. They just happen to know the frequency and that the radio is still left on. He leaves the protection of the tank to follow their radio instructions. The stupidity goes on and on.

Even the front-cover - whilst 'dramatic' is typical of the muddle-headed logic here. If people were desparate to get out of the city -they'd have used even the on-coming lanes.

If this is what's left I'd give then two weeks to survive.",1300838400,15,1640,4.451505016722408

The characters, for the most part, act in a believable manner, though there are some instances of over dramatics that irked me in places (Without going into spoilers, Andrea's actions at the RV in the aftermath of the camp attack come to mind as the most memorable example of this.)

The first five episodes were strong and very character driven.  I particularly liked how the characters (even the minor ones) were testing the boundaries of what is now acceptable in a post apocalyptic world of people making choices.

The main reason I didn't give this one five stars is the sixth episode.  To put it bluntly, it was a stinker and I didn't care for that episode at all.  I don't really think I can adequately describe what I didn't like about TS-19 without spoilers except to say that it was overly predictable and riddled with cliches.

That episode aside, I am very interested to catch the new season when it comes out in the fall.  It's dark and edgy.

I haven't had a chance to look at most of the extras, but they seem like standard fare (behind the scenes of each episode, commentary from the creator, and so on).",1300665600,3,1200,4.544186046511628
4293702,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"I too, like many of the other reviewers have read the comics from issue 1 to 82 and own the 6 hardcover books. I also watched each episode as they aired in HD. As far as the show itself, I really like what they have done. I will never be one of these people who think that a graphic novel or book should be anything like what is made into tv/movies. This part of my review is for people who love the comics but have never seen the show. Look at this tv show as an alternate telling of the story. Kirkman himself wanted this show to be something that reading fans could watch and not know everything that is going to happen. Yes, there are only six episodes in the first season. This is all that AMC would green-light for the series' premiere season as it was not known at the time that the show would be as big a hit as it has turned out to be. I thought I was lucky and picked this season up for only 20 bucks so I felt that it was a good deal, price-wise, for a week one purchase.

However, now that I have gotten to watch it, I am horribly bummed... The production quality of these dvd's is beyond crap. I watched it on my pc monitor, 28"" lcd, and the picture quality is beyond unacceptable. Out of the 250+ dvd's I own, this one takes the cake as the absolute worst picture quality of them all. Very pixelated and at times, people's hair looks fake as it was so blurry during motion, it looked as if it were a plastic wig. As a test, I downloaded the first episode in non-HD format and it was like night and day with what I am looking at with these dvd's. I have a couple friends who are waiting for the mail to deliver their copies and am hoping that this is a specific issue to my set that I can return and get one that isn't so bad.

As far as the extras go, that has made up some for the episode quality. There are a lot of neat behind the scenes featurettes and a decent interview with the cast and writers about what they were hoping to do with the show.

Overall I have to give this one 3 stars. This rating is for the total package. Five stars on the show/extras, one star for the quality of what I received.",1300665600,2,2120,4.0308788598574825

The way the show enwraps you around every character to the point where you start caring about them. Forget the geeks that claim it is not sticking to the Comic book version. Who cares? It's no longer a comic book, it is a TV show now. Sure it's a zombie show and zombie movies are a dime a dozen but is NOT about the zombies but rather how the humans cope to survive and the struggles they go through in other to do so. Every week this show would leave you with a cliffhanger that would leave you wanting more and screaming at the tv for ending lol. Sure there are gory scenes ( those with weak stomachs will have to turn away ), I mean we are talking about a zombie show and zombies must be dealt with the only way there is. However the gore is pretty much limited to a couple of scenes per episode. This show is produced by Gale Ann Hurd former wife and colaborator of James Cameron which speaks volumes. Not because of her ties with him but her own credentials ( Original Terminator, Aliens ). In a tv world filled with crap reality shows about bitching, rich spoiled wives, fighting drunk bimbos and competition shows we have lost the Tv we once knew of well written scripts and cliffhangers. Well The Walking Dead has answered our prayers. I cant stress enough what a good and addictive show this is.

Now, I'm not really sure what the intent is here, but it doesn't look like they set out to mirror the series, because for the most part they don't. I have spoken with other fans of the book, and they all seem to be pretty split 50/50 on whether or not they enjoy that.

That being said, the diversions from the book, and it really diverts, aren't too bad, though they have their moments. I think the episode ""Vatos"" really should have been left out, but I think they did an awesome job with episodes 2 and 3, and I love the story they added. There are quite a bit of added characters, which I can only assume are in place to be killed off.

The thing I love most about this, is that they did a great job with the casting, and they did the visual effects justice. The zombies look awesome. I was a little scared that this might turn out to be a cheesy TV makeover, but they really did a great job here.

4293711,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Acclaimed director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) has seemingly done the impossible by taking zombies, probably the least television-friendly genre, and has brought them shambling to the small screen with The Walking Dead, adapted from the comic book series written by Robert Kirkman.

Deputy sheriff Rick Grimes is gunned down after a high-speed chase on the highways of Georgia and ends up comatose. But Rick's nightmare truly begins when he wakes up to find the dead have come back to life to feast upon the living. He sets out to find his wife and son, whom he believes have abandoned their homes for safer shelter and could still be alive. He ventures to Atlanta to find it overrun by ""walkers,"" and only manages to make it out alive with the aid of a handful of survivors who have set up camp in the hills outside of town. Rick joins the group as they struggle to survive zombie attacks, internal conflicts within the group, and a journey to the CDC in search of a cure, answers, or just hope in a future where the likelihood of living much longer is incredibly slim.

Darabont sets a measured, cinematic pace, so nothing in the show feels rushed for the sake of fitting the hourlong timeslot. The show certainly doesn't skimp on production value either, as we get to see all the guts and gore (and even the occasional profanity) that is inherent in the zombie genre. Thankfully, cable channel AMC, producers of shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, allows its shows to push the envelope with its content, because if The Walking Dead had been produced by one of the more conservative broadcast channels, then the show probably would not have turned out as fantastic as it did. We also get to see broad cityscapes ravaged by the fall of society, and it's pretty remarkable that any major city would let a production of any kind take over its streets the way The Walking Dead does with Atlanta.

But the element that makes the show truly shine is the human element. It isn't a show merely about zombies, its about the struggles of those left standing after the world ends. The title ""The Walking Dead"" describes the zombies who have overrun the planet, but it also describes Rick and the other survivors and the almost hopeless nature of their situation. They might survive the hoards of undead now, but for how long? Is there any point of holding out hope when it seems almost futile to try in a world where falling prey to the flesh-eating masses seems inevitable?

The Walking Dead may be a television series, but it has the look and feel of a big-budget zombie film, and it was easily the best new series of 2010.

This two-disc Blu-Ray set includes all of Season 1's episodes as well as behind-the-scenes and ""Making Of"" docs as well as a fun little tutorial about doing your own zombie make-up by Greg Nicotero of the Oscar-winning special effects group KNB EFX.",1300320000,2,2898,4.65234375

This is an excellent show, and I am anxiously waiting for the next season.  This is so much more than Man vs. Zombie.  It is the story of survival of Man vs. any disaster.  In this case it is zombies, but it could be disease, virus, war, whatever, but it ultimately is man trying to survive in a massive world breakdown.

I thought each episode was well thought out, and flowed very well.  It's only six episodes -- more like a miniseries in that the story was continuously played with the only gap being when the characters broke for sleep.  The only real complaint I had is that I didn't really connect with some characters, but only because I didn't think the acting was that good in those cases.  I thought the main leads were excellent and perfectly cast, especially Andrew Lincoln, John Bernthal (both new to me) and of course, Jeffrey DeMunn who always fits every role he plays.  Andrew Lincoln is incredibly believable in this role.

Frank Darabont is all over this series.  I think the graphic books that this series is based on are really good, but they do  seem like Man vs. Zombies.  Darabont fleshed out the books (and changed much) but I think for the best.

4293716,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"This show had extreme promise and delivered - its first 2 episodes. But then it got bogged down in a Jericho-like syrup of a story that made the zombies less and less the focus. I have no doubt that a good zombie series will play up human interactions as much or more than the zombies, but the last 3 episodes of this already-short first ""season"" almost had to make up a subset of the story just to have an excuse to show a few zombies. Why call it The Walking Dead when they are so minor to the story before you're halfway through??? So, 5 stars to the first 2 episodes, 4 to the third, and 1 to the final 3 equals a mediocre rating of about 3 stars. We enjoyed the story of the last 3 episodes but the title IS The Walking Dead and the Walking Dead had better play a big role in the shows or else it's a broken promise of a series.",1300060800,9,833,3.9940119760479043
4293717,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Since I've been together with my fiance, I've been immersed in the wonderful world of zombies.  If there's anything zombie that's come out in the past couple of years we've seen it.  So it came as no surprise when one night he's like, we're going out, The Walking Dead is out on video now.  I of course was clueless and suppressed a small groan.  ""Not another zombie movie!"".  Nope, not another movie, this ones a tv series was his answer to me, his eyes lit up with glee.  Surprisingly, I was engrossed from the first episode.

SYNOPSIS: (There may be spoilers!)

This is a short series; only six episodes long at this time.  But there is a lot packed into those episodes.  We're given a little bit of intro in which we are introduced to Rick Grimes a deputy sheriff in a small town, who is shot in the line of duty despite his partner Shane's best efforts to keep him safe.  When Grimes next wakes up, he is in the hospital and no one is responding to his calls.  His machines are off, and the flowers left are dead.  He stumbles out into a scene of madness with the hospital ripped apart and dead bodies lying everywhere.  Stumbling around in his hospital gown he encounters some things a bit scarier though, as he leaves the hospital the whole area is destroyed and bodies are piled everywhere.  There's one that he sees while taking a bike that looks demolished, but then it starts moving.  Still disoriented from waking up in the hospital after being in that long coma he continues home to see what has happened to his wife Lori and son Carl.

Defeated after finding the house empty, he stops to rest and doesn't really pay attention to the strange moving man coming up the street towards him.  But then two more people come on the scene and brutally murder the man in front of him.  Still weak and having been hit by one of them, he passes out only to awaken later being cared for by a man and his son.  They explain what has been going on in the world since he's been in a coma.  They explain all about the Walkers, and how to destroy them.  Later, he leaves and sets out for Atlanta, hoping to find his family and some safe refuge.  Atlanta isn't what he expects though.  Thinking he has met his end he is rescued at the last minute by a foraging group in the city.  They are part of a group camped outside the city and are just trying to survive.  Now, with all odds against them they have to make it out of the city and back to everyone else, but even after that, what are they going to do in a world taken over by the walking dead?

I'd never really seen any of these actors in anything before, but I think they all did a magnificent job.  Fear is prevalent throughout the movie and all were able to express that very well.  Rick as a character was somewhat unbelievable at times and had an uncanny knack for surviving.  But I suppose that's what makes the story.  I think his wife is a raging jerk and very finicky and I'm not fond of her at all.  Everyone else is pretty interesting and its a good mix up to do the story.

All the effects were remarkably done.  Everything was very lifelike and the zombies both creeped me out, grossed me out, and amazed me all at the same time.  It was even scary in certain moments.  Some of the imagery was incredible.  The picture shown on the cover of the dvd set is of Rick riding a horse down an empty road into Atlanta.  This is a real scene from the movie and it was very powerful.  Most of them are in fact.  But they are also very brutal.  There is a lot of gore and violence in this movie and it can be stomach turning.  If you can't even handle a little bit of blood, this series is not for you.

I can't wait for the second season to come out.  There is a lot of unfinished business and it will be a long time before fall.  I want to know what happens, six episodes just wasn't enough.  There are too many things left unexplained.  I guess until then I'll just to find something else to occupy my time but it'll be tough.  What a great show!

4293718,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I just sat down with a large group of friends and family and we watched the whole series (6 episodes across 2x Blu-Ray discs) this past Saturday.  People came for a birthday party but I turned it into a video-fest.  Everybody loved it, from 10-year-old kids to 50-year-old couples, we all enjoyed this show!  There are some violent scenes (Zombies!) but only one sexual adulteress scene, and the scary parts are quick, so the kids didn't freak out.  Most of the time is spent on the surviving humans and their drama.  Little details are kept across episodes, like the grenade, bag of guns, etc.

If you love Sunday nights on HBO, Showtime, and Starz with their high-end series like Soporanos, The Wire, Spartacus, etc. then you will love The Walking Dead.  AMC, who knew?

Normally I only buy movies on disc, but after loving this purchase I will look to buy more series on disc.

I am also an avid collector of guns...a newish hobby that started when the USA went crazy and I lost a few hundred thousand dollars in the stock market.  This show demonstrates the point, best to keep a bunch of shotguns and pistols nearby just in case!",1299974400,,1134,4.569306930693069
4293719,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The end comes to the first season in this nice little piece of episode six. Also, there is commentary that cna be gotten to go with this for free, making everything understood. The group has trekked for a while and has gotten to what they think is a safe place, right outside of zombie reach. This leads them to feel like they are in fgood hands, and it leads to a time of rest. The only problem with that is not asking the right questions, and questions are always good things.

As the season ends, you expect a lot fo the undead to rear their heads. That is not the point of this season, however, and good things happen in the human part of the drama. Good acting comes forth, some motion pushes people on, and some of the cast dies out in a turn that makes the cast keep moving.

I liked the way everything ended and it makes sense to go this route. I origianlly downloaded this and the episodes that goes with it, and I think they go good together. It talks about the direciton and it had some commentary with the cast, making some interesting observations. This is a 5/5 way to go with the first piece of the human/ undead experience.",1299974400,,1139,4.268518518518518

Suspenseful and chilling. No ridiculous zombie/humor here with half-baked characters or sub-marginal types posing as heroes. There are some real heroes here, of all races and genders. No Olympic sprinting zombies. This is the real deal straight out of George Romero's playbook. Serious action, and quality actors who develop both complex and compassionate characters that you can really care about. The world has been waiting for a really quality series based on zombies and here it is. Ten stars.",1299888000,,665,5.529411764705882

I don't buy dvds anymore because I live in the year 2011 and own a 2011 HD tv.. They could of at least put the information on the box for crying out loud.. I paid for a Blu-Ray 2 disk set.

But it doesn't stay very faithful to the spirit of the 'the walking dead' comic series and that's why it's very good.  The acting is excellent too and the effects are outstanding, the show and comics borrowed from many zombie movies particularily Romeros classics but that's ok too. This is high budget tv and it's got good stories and it's only the second tv series featuring zombies ever. The first was the outrageous ""dead air' from the uk , which skewered 'big brother' and the desire for instand fame. I recommend that one too and this one looks great on blu ray.

This is Zombie genre at its best. I think this show will be a cult classic. If you love Zombies or horror this is a must. I highly recommend this set. I cant wait until fall of 2011 for a full season. This only thing i hate about this set is they didn't give us enough episodes. I am excited to see how they will be doing Michone my favorite character. Also thank god they didn't hold back on the shock factor, they you AMC!",1299888000,,577,4.026086956521739

Now Amazon has clearly stated that it is region locked to 1 BUT does not state in ANY WAY that its BD is locked to region A which is VERY different to regions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

4293726,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"It seems that horror films have changed drastically over the past few years. Where once there was a cycle that lasted about ten years between horror films being popular, they seem to be more mainstream now than ever. Not only tlat, the horror genre has kicked into gear crossing over into other areas as well. Books like THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE, zombie movies galore and finally the comic book series that has now made its way to TV and DVD: THE WALKING DEAD.

Based on the hit comic book series that continues to this day, this zombie outing is unlike any other in most ways. True the beginning of the series seems a bit like 28 DAY LATER, but once you get past that it's one of the most original zombie tales ever filmed. And unlike most it doesn't focus near as much on the zombies as it does on the survivors.

The series starts with officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) being shot and put into a coma. When he wakes, he discovers no one is left on his floor of the hospital and most rooms on the floor tossed and turned. As he slowly makes his way through the white corridors, he comes across a chained double door with a warning of what lies beyond spray painted.

Finding clothes and setting out to locate his family, Grimes sees nothing but devastation in any direction he looks. Crashed helicopters and cars are everywhere but no sign of people. Outside the hospital are row upon row of sheet covered corpses. What's happened?

On Grimes trek to his home, he sees up close what has happened. Though unable to believe his eyes, a half rotted corpse drags itself across the grass. Grimes takes the bicycle that apparently belonged to the corpse and heads home only to be knocked unconscious by someone living there.

A man and his son are staying in a house nearby Grimes old home, since vacated by his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs). He explains what happened, though as with most zombie films we have no idea what caused it to happen. He shows Grimes how the zombies walk the streets, attracted by noise and searching for the living to feed off of.

It's not long before Grimes helps the man and his son by taking them to the local police station and arming them heavily as well as providing them a place to shower. The station has its own emergency energy source giving them light and hot water. Grimes heads towards Atlanta in search of his family, sharing a walkie talkie with the man on the chance he makes it there later on.

But this is only a part of the story. As Grimes begins his search, we see his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) among a group of survivors banded together. In this group are Grimes wife and son. And Shane and Grimes wife are now a couple. Eventually we know their paths will meet.

The best part of this show is that the story revolves around people, struggling to survive in a world gone mad. The depth of the show presents us with realistic scenarios of what people would do, how they might react, giving us the more human element of the story rather than focusing on the gore and zombies alone. It is this tale of emotions and the basic instinct for survival that separates this tale from most zombie movies.

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of zombies to be seen and enough gore to keep those fans happy. KNB effects have done another outstanding job here. And scenes like a downtown street in Atlanta filled with zombies moving towards our hero truly make your skin crawl.

Tested with just a few episodes the show was a dynamite hit for AMC and was quickly renewed for a second season much longer than the first. Until that season airs, fans will have to be content with the DVD release of season one. Horror fans will find this a must have for their collection. Movie fans will enjoy the horror film done right. And those just curious will find more than they bargained for from a horror series. Well made, well acted, directed with style and featuring a story that unwraps slowly make this one well worth owning in your collection.",1299715200,,4012,4.483561643835617
4293727,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"""The Walking Dead"" is the most exciting show of the new season.  While its based on a graphic novel of the same title and it adheres to that storyline with shocking fidelity, it certainly borrows freely from various genre entries.  What is surprising about all this, is how fresh it feels.  This is mainly due to the show very wisely focusing on character development, story and its philosophical contemplations on morality Vs. survival and how each character clings to hope or gives up in the face of a world gone insane.  This is truly one of the great doomsday stories and its brought to television with unflinching realism by screenwriter/director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist).  Darabont wisely avoided casting any major stars, but instead has gathered a superb ensemble of character actors which only adds to the show's sense of reality and gives us a depth of character we might not have otherwise had if the show revolved around the vanity of a major star.  It'a exciting, terrifying, moving, and often very funny, with terrific production values and surprisingly graphic, stomach turning gore and violence.  This first season has only six episodes, but the show packs more drama and excitement into those 6 episodes than most shows do in a 20 episode season.

The blu-ray presentation is a 1080p, widescreen picture that looks fabulous and is true to source.  Even if you watched the show in HD, this is a considerable upgrade, as it only enhances the cinematic look and feel.  Shot on 16mm film, instead of video, the show has a grimy, depressed look, with lots of swirling film grain that only adds to the reality of the story making it more immediate and intimate.  This is what Blu-ray is all about.  Fans will be overjoyed by this.  Special effects and mnake-up look fantastic, with every welt and bit of gore visible down to the smallest spots of blood.

The audio is a truly awesome Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mox which lets us know right at the outset that it means business.  Gunshots, explosions, and action are rendered with unnerving realism and power, aided by strong LFE support.  Ambient surrounds are very scary as we can hear zombies moaning and growling all around the listening area.  Dialogue and subtle ambient sound (crickets chirping, birds, sounds of silence) are rendered with pinpoint accuracy.  Dialogue is crisp and beautifully reproduced.  The haunting theme music and score pours fromn the speakers.  Imaging is terrific.  Audiophiles and fans of the show will be giddy listening to ""The Walking Dead"" on BD.

The supplement package is pretty good with a thorough making-of doc, interviews with cast and creators, a doc on ""Zombie School"" shows us how the extras were trained to move like the undead.  I would have enjoyed audio commentaries on select episodes, or even better, all of the episodes given there are only 6 in this first season.  I would have loved to hear the cast offer ruminations on the episode entitled ""Guts"" which required some of the cast members to wear entrails from one of the ""Walkers"" in order to fool them into thinking they were one of them.  But alas, the extras are fairly satisfying, but could have been better.

Overall, this set earns my highest recommendation.  The show is the real focus here and it is produced beautifully with a kickass lossless soundtrack.  This is a must-have for genre fans, and even non-fans will quickly become addicted to this gripping and exciting show.",1299715200,3,3482,4.875850340136054
4293728,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"Based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman, AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" is the first zombie serial made for TV. The story begins with Andrew Lincoln playing Rick Grimes, a Sheriff Deputy who wakes up from a coma in the hospital and finds the zombie apocalypse has taken place around him. He attempts to heal and find his family though it is a struggle just to survive in this new world. The pilot is like a feature-length movie and takes its time setting up the story with amazing tension and visuals.

The opening scene is gripping as the Sheriff is attempting to maneuver through tons of abandoned cars as quietly as possible and sees a young blond girl holding a teddy bear walking barefoot. He calls out to her offering assistance and she slowly turns around to reveal wide blue-eyes and a missing bottom jaw, covered in blood. She begins to approach him and he gulps, steadies himself, and begrudgingly shoots her in the head and winces as he knows it will attract more zombies any second.

The first two episodes of the six are incredible. They are so suspenseful, the characters are exciting and interesting, and the people have common sense survival skills. Other main actors appearing in this series are Jon Bernthal, Sarah Wayne Callies, Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Steven Yeun. I won't say who the characters they play are in relation to Rick to avoid spoilers. The zombies are very detailed and disgustingly cool. One memorable zombie only has an upper body and is dragging herself through the grass with entrails behind her. There's a subplot of a father and son duo surviving day to day in the suburbs that can't bring themselves to leave because the mother is wandering around outside as a zombie and they can't leave her or bring themselves to kill her.
Rick Grimes once he has his bearings decides to head for the city where there are rumors of a safe zone where people have gathered. He hopes to find his family there but the city turns out to be completely overrun with a zombie infestation. Like I said, the first two episodes -- fantastic! After that...it goes downhill a little bit. The group of characters you meet that have assembled together trying to survive begin to make really poor decisions. This just proves that in the zombie apocalypse scenario, the more people you have, the more danger you are in because someone is going to screw up in the name of being human. Oh, you can't bear to leave the most ignorant, racist jerk on the planet  stuck on a rooftop in the city because he's a person? If you go back for him, he'll probably kill you and you'll lose members of your rescue party! It's painful to watch people do stupid stuff and argue amongst themselves over unimportant things and endanger themselves and others around them in the process.

Aside from the stupidity of some characters, the production values are excellent. Every episode feels like part of a big budget movie that keeps going and going and you don't really want it to stop. This show isn't afraid to use silence to establish tension, eeriness, and realism. Then when the music comes in, it is quite a bit more effective.

Bonus Features:

The Blu-ray menu is SCARY. You see a skyline rotating across the screen and then that little blond girl's back and she slowly turns around and moves toward you, eeeeeek! It makes me want to run right out of the room.

""The Making of The Walking Dead"" explains the process of how creator Frank Darabont came across Robert Kirkman's comic books and wanted to make them into a TV series. They strove to find the best actors for the roles but managed to find people who looked quite a deal like the illustrations in the books as well. This featurette goes into production values, makeup, editing and effects, sound, and how they decided to change some of the details of the comic book story in order to be able to surprise the audience.

""Inside The Walking Dead"" goes behind the scenes with each individual episode and they talk about their characters, the breakdown of civilization, and the strenuous situations that they undergo. You also get ""A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman"" about how the series isn't exactly like the book so that the audience could be kept off balance and there is a featurette on Zombie Makeup tips.

There are clips from the San Diego Comic Con Panel with the producers, but it also has the main cast members explaining their roles and the course of the story. Sarah Wayne Callies spends her time on the panel staring at Andrew Lincoln as if she has goo-goo eyes for his accent. They all say the bare minimum, look terrified at the sea of people, but are gracious to be there. Also, there's a trailer on the Blu-ray. There are really good features here for a season with only six episodes and I think they knew that and beefed it up a bit for a better value. The Blu-ray quality is spectacular and it does make me want to tune in for the next season.",1299715200,11,4921,4.602052451539339

I really appreciate how the writers did not just follow the comic's plot. Had they done this the translation would have been very poor. By saving the key elements of the world that the story takes place in and the epic characters that fans of the series have grown to love this series is an excellent choice for fans of the graphic novel, zombie lovers, or the completely uninitiated.",1299628800,3,560,4.394230769230769
4293732,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I've generally never considered myself to be a fan of horror films, so I didn't pay much attention to the zombie genre. Shaun of the Dead, that hilarious loving tribute to zombie movies and George Romero, got me interested. So did the brilliant 28 Days Later. So, from there, I watched Romero's newer stuff. Then his older stuff. And then I got hooked. Now I'm in to the zombie book genre. I'm a sociologist, so the zombie genre fascinates me because it's as much about the people and the collapse of society as it is about the zombies. You could argue that the zombies are just a backdrop for the human drama. So, I was really excited about The Walking Dead. I love zombie movies, but I was intrigued by the prospect of a TV series, in which the filmmakers have time to explore classic zombie genre issues and ideas more thoroughly.

I wasn't disappointed. It's a solid show. At times it felt a bit clichd, and some of the subplots felt unnecessary or implausible. But the acting is generally strong, the effects are great, and I'm looking forward to the second season. For folks that want a wall-to-wall gorefest, it might be a bit disappointing. Some episodes are almost zombie-free. This show is really about the people. But that's ultimately a strength, and again providing evidence for my theory that the best zombie stories just use zombies as a backdrop for exploring what it means to be a human living among other humans.",1299628800,2,1430,4.6299212598425195
4293733,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I will give Season 1 3.5-4 stars for the following reasons.
Good:
When seeing it was an AMC series, I knew they didn't skimp on their shows but I was hesitant in how well they could do a zomie film with all the special effects and such. The effects here were really well done. My hat comes off to the effects crew on this. It was top notch. There was a behind the scenes showing one actor getting his makeup applied and although they could have shown a much better example, it was a good clip.
Cameos: There are many cameos in this series that go uncreditted. 5 episodes have Norman Reedus (Boondock Saints) who sticks around for some time and has a major part but as stated, is uncreditted at the beginning. This was a surprise that I am willing to put in the GOOD side. Also, Michael Rooker (Mallrats, The Replacement Killers) had a cameo for 2 episodes that was uncreditted in the opening. Again, good to see some big names providing good input.
Acting: Was well done. It didn't seem like a made for TV movie. They really stepped up and made a good show.
PLOT: Is good and bad for the following reason. I have seen movies like Pulp Fiction (for instance) that didn't go in exact chronological order and they were still great. This series jumps a round a little bit and felt like they didn't have to do that and it made it a little less enjoyable. We open with our main character in a cop car with his partner talking about their relationships. In a police chase, the main character gets shot. Cut to, our hero in the hospital, zombies are already taking over, eventually our hero makes his way home to find nothing/no one. When he comes across his partner later, the partner initially acts like he doesn't know him? Also, I believe the partner was now with the hero's wife? This issue was discussed in the show but we never really got a conclusion.
SPOILER
Second example, a guy named Jim gets bit but it's not quite the end of the season, he is left by the road and the survivors move on without him. So, we know he got bit, we do not know if he turns. Season 2 can still have him return but he wasn't a strong character to begin with.
What did the scientist wisper to Officer Grimes? I think it was that he is a ""carrier"" of the disease. Remember he took blood samples of everyone? Also, his partner said that Grimes had no pulse. He thought he was dead.
BAD:
I have to say, it seemed short for the money you pay. I watched the entire season in one evening. I couldn't do that with True Blood.
I say, even with a few odd plot holes, and some non-chronological annoyances that go unanswered in this season, it is still a good series and worth the watch. 3.5-4 stars is respectable. Lets give credit here to the actors, effects and overall story.
I am rating the regular DVD. It has a behind the scenes for the making of, one for each episode and one for the zombie makup. Bluray might have more special features but the reg. DVD has plenty.",1299628800,5,2944,4.315884476534296

4293735,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This is a zombie television series.

What sets it apart is four things. First is very high production value, this is of the same quality as the best Television has to offer and frankly surpasses next to all movies in the same genre. The second is strong character development, it allows a character build up and you get to feel and hope for the characters. The third is - It is scary like hell. Well built up tension, shock effects - everything is there and done well. If you like scary it will deliver and deliver well. The last is the plot. O.k. Zombie is zombie, but the story is plot driven and builds up. Here is shows well that it is built on solid ground, the graphic novel it is based on.

Where it is not perfect is certain nit picking things, like, well Zombies in general and survivor stupidness. All zombie stories have this weakness and this is no exception. But all zombie stories require a suspension of disbelief and this is no exception.

5 stars as it is among the best horror tv and zombie stories out there.",1299542400,7,1027,4.366492146596858

4293737,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"All it takes for society to fall apart are a couple of zombies who can infect everyone else and that, perhaps, is why Frank Darabont's TV version of the popular graphic novel resonates so clearly; it's about how precarious our existence truly is and the irony in the title for the survivors of this massive catastrophe is clear--THEY are truly ""The Walking Dead"" of the title--one step away from becoming denizens of zombieville and spelling the end of the line for humanity if they can't survive.

The Blu-ray looks extremely good--""The Walking Dead"" was shot on 16mm film and, as a result, is quite grainy but that only adds to the ""reality"" of the series. The digital transfer keeps the series ""look"" as it was presented on AMC intact. Colors are nice throughout and although the show looks a bit soft that appears to be intentional.

If amazon is still filing this under DVD as well I can't comment on the DVD picture quality but have been told it looks quite good.

The extras are quite nice for the show--there's nothing on the first disc but disc two of the Blu-ray is packed with goodies. We get a 30 minute documentary that focuses on the creation and development of the series.

""Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-Up Tips"" is a clever short that let's us in on what it takes to make a zombie.

We also get half a dozen short pieces that take us behind-the-scenes on specific episodes.

""Zombie School"" demonstrates the training it takes to get people act like the undead.

""Bicycle Girl"" gives us the background on the creation of one memorable zombie in particular and we get an 11 minute featurette on the Comic Con panel presentation of the show.

We also get ""On Set with Andrew Lincoln"" letting the actor discuss his character. ""Hanging With Steve Yeun"", ""On Set With Robert Kirkman""(the graphic artist who created the original print version) and ""Inside Dale's RV"" each run about four minutes and are self explanatory featurettes.

Could this set have been better? Sure--if we had a couple of commentary tracks from the writers/producers/directors that might have given us some additional ""meat"" to ""bite into"" and learn about the production of the series. Nevertheless, this is an extremely good set that fans of the series will enjoy. It's a pity the first season was so short and that fans have to wait so long for the new season to start. I'm just hungry for more.",1299456000,9,2380,4.701923076923077
4293738,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"""The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season""  is probably one of the most ambitious horror series made specifically for television.  The notion of cannibalistic zombies roaming mindlessly with only one instinct -- to eat the living -- seems way beyond taboo for the small screen.  But AMC took it on and the show premiered, appropriately, on Halloween night, 2010.

County Sheriff Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) awakens from a coma utterly alone in a post-apocalyptic zombie world.  The world he knows is gone.  The series, based on Robert Kirkman's successful, popular comic book series, tells the story of the weeks and months that follow the apocalypse.  All six episodes are contained in this two-disc set.

On the plus side, ""The Walking Dead"" is graphic and doesn't cut away from the more gruesome scenes.  Fans of zombie flicks will appreciate that.  Special effects are outstanding, from the zombies' ghastly make-up to sequences in which the zombies feast on their victims.  The acting, overall, is good, particularly from Andrew Lincoln as the sheriff, Jon Bernthal as Deputy Shane Walsh, and Jeffrey DeMunn as retired widower Dale.

The downside is that, after the first episode, there are long stretches of talk, talk, talk, with little zombie footage.  We get a lot of background on the eight main characters, maybe more than we really care about.  It's the zombies that are the primary attraction.  When they do appear, they're creepy, scary, and make for exciting moments.

Bonus features are generous.  In addition to a making-of featurette, there is a behind-the-scenes look at the zombie make-up, ""A Sneak Peek With Robert Kirkman,"" conversation with the producers, trailer, and six mini-featurettes featuring assorted cast members.",1299456000,2,1749,5.233812949640288

This is not a show about zombies.  This is a show about people, and about how they deal individually after their world ends.  It's well-written, well-acted, and incredibly realistic and riveting.

This extra takes us through the show's genesis with the cast and crew talking about it with plenty of behind-the-scenes clips. Highlights include seeing Greg Nicotero applying zombie makeup.

""Inside The Walking Dead: Episodes 1-6"" consist of five minute featurettes about each episode from the first season with cast and crew talking about their intentions for them.

""A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman"" features the writer introducing more behind-the-scenes with clips from the show and the cast talking about it. There is some overlap from the Making Of featurette.

""Behind the Scenes Zombie Make-Up Tests"" sees Nicotero giving some insight into how they transform a person into a zombie. This is a fascinating extra as we see the process broken down for you to try if so inclined.

""Convention Panel with Producers"" features highlights from the San Diego Comic Con with Kirkman, Darabont, Nicotero and others. They talk about how the show differs from its source material. The cast also join the panel and talk about their characters.

Also included is a trailer.

""Zombie School"" shows how the extras are taught to act like zombies.

""Bicycle Girl"" takes us through the genesis of a memorable zombie in the pilot episode.

""On Set with Robert Kirkman"" features another location shoot from the pilot episode.

""Hanging with Steven Yeun"" features the actor giving us a tour of another location and speaking fondly of his love for the comic book, which he was into even before the show was made.

""Inside Dave's RV"" features Jeffrey DeMunn taking us on a whimsical tour of his character's Winnebago.

I like the characters; except for the wife, I agree, she is weak and they need to boost her character up a lot.  I find the hillbilly character very good.  He gets the job done and he is not the stupid one in the group.  It will be interesting to see if they continue the sequel.  It does keep you on your seat and in suspense.

As with any good horror film/show the inter-personal conflict among the characters pushes the narrative forward and shows that the most vengeful adversaries to the heroes are the other member of the group. The show portrays the differences in Americas social as stereotypes, but that is better than everyone being portrayed as the same single dimensional character. Worth watching over most other shows out-there.",1298851200,,431,5.447761194029851
4293743,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I never intended to watch this show.  I am not a zombie fan. Nor do I watch shows on AMC besides Breaking Bad. Well, I mostly watch that on dvd. But that Halloween I was at home and flipping through channels when I came to the repeat of the pilot episode. I loved it. I've always been fond of a good post apocalyptic tale of survival and Walking Dead delivered.

I find it odd to see so many reviews regarding weak acting or writing since it is due to the great performances of the actors, which has made me fall in love with the show.  I can not enjoy a tale about survival if I am not emotionally connected with the people who are struggling to survive. I guess for most folk the zombie killing would be enough but not for me.

I recommend owning The Walking Dead not to just to see the zombie slaying but for the characters who you will become attached. You will end up wanting to follow their stories as they attempt to survive in a new world.

Standout performances in my opinion (BEWARE SPOILERS BELOW!):

Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes - Amazing!  He's not Bryan Cranston but he really makes you root for his character.  The cycle of emotions that he had to process alone in the pilot was riveting.  His scene of reuniting with his family was so great. It gets me every time I watch it.

Steve Yeun as Glenn - I hate annoying and whining teens or young adults on tv shows. Thank god, Glenn is brave, smart and capable, while at the same time terrified and disgusted by the horror that has overtaken the world. Yeun does a really good job at finding that balance, which is really harder than it looks.

Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon -Daryl is a walking stereotype that Reedus elevates beyond convention to make you really feel sorry for and root for the jerk.  Seriously, I usually can't stand redneck characters. The nuances that he brings out with the angry pacing, conflicted emotions and grudging cooperation with the group are excellent.

Laurie Holden as Andrea -  Holden successfully conveys a woman terrified not only for herself and her sister but also determined to protect and provide for her family. Thanks to Holden's excellent performance you could tell that her sister was the reason she was holding it all together, which foreshadows her later breakdown. It is a very nice parallel to Rick. Where Rick is able to reunite with his family, Andrea ends up losing her own family in one of the best scenes of the season.  Her story is one I am really forward to seeing next season.

There are lots of other great characters and performances but I just wanted to highlight some of the MVPs of the first season. I can't wait to see more of these characters next season. So, more character drama, I say! I want flashback stories before the zombie apocalypse. I even want a CDC flashback with Jenner and his wife. Let's hopefully get some awesome new characters also!",1298764800,4,2878,4.495201535508637
4293744,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Zombies... what can I say? They're the antithesis to the very best that humanity has to offer.

I recently rented the Romero trilogy: ""Night of..."", ""Dawn of..."" and ""Day of..."". They're classics-all of them. And working on many different levels, they offer insight into us: the human species. Almost every human characteristic is explored: cooperation, consumerism, hate, trust, race, stress, FEAR, leadership, ingenuity, hope, loss, paranoia, claustrophobia, political ideology, deprivation, deception, companionship, cunning, strength, DEATH, murder-the list is endless.

If we are all of these things, then what are Zombies? Our polar opposite?

And besides, aren't we all, at some point in our lives, forced to be a little bit of a mindless, all-consuming, walking-dead zombie.

Forget alldat vampire B.S.----ZOMBIES zwhere the party's at!

Anyway...

Frank Darabount is the main man behind ""The Walking Dead"". He was the director of ""The Mist"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"". There are plenty of parallels that can be made between his films and Romero's Trilogy-especially ""The Mist"". I suggest renting it.

I know nothing of the comic that inspires the show, but some day I will prob. enjoy reading it too.

If you like Romero and Darabount, especially Darabount, then you will LOVE this show. It's EXCELLENT!

He roams around with a fuel can looking for gasoline but doesn't think of putting a pick through the petrol tanks of the abandoned cars. He collects guns and amnunition from the Police Station but no gasoline. I would have thought a Police Garage would have a storage tank and at least a few full jerry cans in case of emergency.

The script writing is poor; the part where he rides into the centre of the city into a swarm of zombies was pure stupidity.
I thought to myself; how is this guy going to survive 5 more episodes seeing his capacity for caution and logical thought plus his survival skills are zero.

4293753,2,B0049P1ZZQ,"The Walking Dead is one of my favorite comic books of all time. In an age of ""event"" comics where trademark characters are killed only to be retconned (for those of you that aren't comic book nerds, that's retroactive continuity, an intellectually lazy way to explain past events that don't make any sense given the current situation. A good example would be a character coming back to life after being killed only to find out it was his twin brother that died, a character you've never seen nor heard of before) because real death would cost too much money, a world in which ""no one is safe"" is appealing. The Walking Dead is as close as you can get to a real world tale of a zombie apocalypse. There is no morality, there is no good, there is only survival for you and your own.

Now, flash forward to the Walking Dead TV series. After an incredibly strong pilot episode, things just go downhill. One of the things the comic does extremely well is the ever-present danger that the dead pose. You can blink your eyes and get attacked. That simply isn't the case in the TV show. The survivors, while not totally safe, rest near the rock quarry like they're on a camping trip. They do laundry, they fish, they talk (ad nauseum), they shout...not counting 1 major event, I can only recollect 1 scene in which a walker is even near the campsite, and it is quickly and silently dispatched by Daryl. Not only is an apocalypse an easy situation to build suspense, but the writers simply seem like they weren't even interested in trying.

Now, I didn't expect a tit-for-tat adaptation, nor did I necessarily want one. However, for a 6 episode season, an inordinate amount of time is spent on inconsequential plot devices. I'm speaking primarily about the final episode. We get this long explanation about how the virus works. Why does it matter? Whether it is an act of God, a biological weapon, or anything in between, it doesn't change the situation one bit: the civilized world, as you know it, is over. The tagline for the comic is ""In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally begin living."" Not ""in a world ruled by dead, a small group of survivors hunts for the cure to an extinction event"". The reason the Walking Dead has done so well as an independent creator-owned comic (an INCREDIBLY rare occurrence) is because we see ourselves in the book. How would we deal justice in this world? If someone steals food, a benign crime today that can kill everyone in this world? Do you warn them not to do it again? What if they don't listen? These are the things we never hope to have to decide, let alone see their horrible ramifications. I waited to see these hard decisions, not only for those who were put into them but also to see the impact on the group. What I saw were few decisions, let alone any with negative ramifications for the group, which seemed incredibly passive as those things happened. One can only hope that in season 2 one of the group gets infected and as they waste needed food and medical supplies on a lost cause it turns around and bites them, literally.

Now, I can write off some of this to a show simply getting its bearings. Some of my favorite shows had terrible first seasons. The U.N gang watching their grandmas? A white trash wife beater and his kind-hearted wife that makes every excuse she can think of? A pair of racist, redneck brothers, one of which is named Meryl? A near rape and near execution from a guy that 10 minutes earlier was the just, strong group leader? And T-Dog? T-DOG?!??!?! An ""Urban"" character with a fashion sense that looks like he was plucked from a Wayans brothers movie shot in 1992. Who the Hell introduces himself as ""T-Dog"" during the zombie apocalypse? This is just lazy, lazy writing.

When I read that they fired the entire writing staff I thought maybe the higher ups saw how in the long-term people will pick up on these ridiculous characters and situations, but it turns out that was a false rumor. I can only hope that season 1 simply had a ton of growing pains that they can work out and season 2 starts with a massacre of terrible characters that no one gives a damn about.",1297123200,36,4154,4.498013245033112
4293754,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"++++  NO SPOILERS ++++

I love horror and outre film and television, but, no pun intended, I thought until ""The Walking Dead"" that the zombie genre was a played out mining town.  Starting far back with Bela Lugosi's fantastic ""White Zombie"" all the way up through the masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ending in satire with the hilarious ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I thought myself to be on safe ground in this harshly critical assessment.  Sometimes, it's a pleasure to be flat wrong.

I watched all six episodes of this, and cannot wait for the next season.  It's an ensemble acting piece, so focus never lingers too long on any one particular character.  This is a brilliant opening gambit for television since the viewer can, in a way, vicariously share the dread of ""just getting to know someone"" and then have them ripped away, either by the evil of men, mischance, or zombie attack.  Some think that the acting is contrived.  I do not.  All of the characters are on edge, just up to the point of hysteria, and played consistently thus.  True, it can make for one-note dialogue and predictable, archetypal situations, but what other notes might there be in the opening month of the end of the world, and a world not only ending but grown hideously hostile to boot?  It will be interesting to see how the actors manage the change into something ""else"" as they adapt to a zombie-filled world, and I hope they are up to the challenge.  From the looks of things thus far, they are.

And this makes the title especially provocative.  One would assume that ""The Walking Dead"" refers to zombies.  I am not sure of that at all.  Here, the undead are the backdrop to the action, not the action itself.  The action lies in the excellent ensemble acting and cleverly turned scripting.  It may well unfold that the living are the ones who end up truly meriting that disturbing title, not the once-human shambling mounds of flesh haunting the desolate streets of ""Necropolis Atlanta.""  I have an odd suspicion that by the end of season two, the mindless juggernaut of zombie hordes will be a pale shadow compared to the darker and more malevolent forces that can shape the human soul into something far more fearful and terrifying.  And these six shows set up that subtle possibility with suprising elegance as the normal turns suddenly abnormal and the ""brave new world"" or both urban and rural America comes bloodily undone.

This is not a show for the faint of heart.  The make-up and effects for television are very well done and almost entirely convincing.  The adult situations, profanity, and desperate sexuality also make ""The Walking Dead"" unsuitable for minors.  But for adults, this is nothing less than a treat and not a ""guilty pleasure.""

So spread the word.  Zombies are back, and very scary again.  Almost as scary as the people trying to outlive them.  Five stars.",1296950400,100,2900,4.709741550695825

Attention to detail: Episode 1 and 2 has a CB radio installed in an M1A1 main battle tank. The US military does not use CB radios and therefore there are no mounts for them in their vehicles nor means to power them. Episode 1 has dead US soldiers on the M1A1, one wearing DCUs (Desert Camoflage Uniform), that uniform was phased out and is not worn by personnel while in the US. Episode 6 shows a heavy machinegun emplacement with a DShK heavy machinegun. Problem is, the DShK is a Russian heavy machinegun, not used by the United States and our ammunition is not usable in the DShK. There is a glaring lack of dropped M4s, M16s and M249s amongst the dead soldiers. Also, the General that would use Main Battle tanks as a defense for a street or area around the CDC or other city areas rather than razorwire, HMMWVs and/or M2/M3 Bradleys deserves to be eaten by zombies.

4293758,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I'm the type that can always find something 'just not right' with television, film and books, but where 'The Walking Dead' is concerned, I can find NOTHING. This show has broken records, was renewed for a second season long before the first season was over and will continue to captivate viewers as long as it stays on the air (if the 1-year-long wait for Season Two doesn't tick too many fans off and send them packing). Now let me tell you why...

The Cast -

Nothing bugs me more than how television and even film tend to think that getting the hottest, clone-like, most high-profile actors is a necessity. While the cast of The Walking Dead are not by any means unattractive, they are real, relatable, everyday-looking human beings like your next door neighbor, or that guy that works as a mechanic at Jiffy Lube. Fans can easily relate to every character on this show in some way and not be distracted by the Hollywood 'expectations', which so many television shows and movies live by. Look at the cast of films such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and yes, even Twilight (dare I say it!)! Many of these actors were extremely low-profile, or in the case of Harry Potter, practically nobody. Now imagine if Steven Spielberg landed the Harry Potter director's job and cast Haley Joel Osment as Harry, or if Sean Connery accepted the role of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings. Do I really need to say it? I didn't think so. So yes, characters matter. They matter A LOT, and if you want a kick a*s television show or film, then choose the cast based on character, not on fame and sex appeal.

The Location -

Face it, a good majority of all television and film is not only shot in New York, Chicago and other huge cities as such, but base their story lines in those places as well. There ARE other people and places in the United States, y'know! If The Walking Dead was shot in Chicago instead of Atlanta, I would've been ticked off, needless to say. But like with casting characters that so many average people can relate to, the storyline taking place primarily in a city OTHER THAN the `Hollywood cities', is just as important.

The Storyline -

In addition to all of the excellent reviews and comments by fans out there, I've also run across quite a few haters (can't be successful without haters!) who have griped and complained about this and that and blah, blah, blah. Basically, the majority of negative comments I have seen seem to revolve around one thing: PREDICTABILITY. These are people who expected Dr. Jenner to know every single thing about this `virus' and give it all up in episode 6, and about other things that did not happen, but they pretty much thought would. The Walking Dead storyline isn't entirely PREDICTABLE! Really? And that's a bad thing how? Personally, I was extremely happy that episode 6 went out the way it did and that the characters didn't go into the CDC and leave with the knowledge that would obviously send them out to find the cure, which is a plant that only grows on ledges under waterfalls. I want to be surprised when I watch something new and The Walking Dead has definitely delivered UNpredictably!

It's NOT About Police Investigations or Emergency Rooms-

CSI, Chase, CSI, NCIS, CSI, CSI - Really...when is enough, enough? The Walking Dead comes out and is a godsend to television riddled with cop and doctor shows, not to mention, fake reality TV.

Kick-a*s, Gruesome ZOMBIES -

No need to explain this; watch the show and it speaks for itself.

The Walking Dead is my favorite show E.V.E.R - just can't beat it. I highly recommend buying Season I ASAP!",1296000000,12,3612,4.6018662519440126

In the comic series lori is preggo. I have been reading the series since issue 6 and they are at issue 80. thats 7 years of reading this comic. the cdc scenerio never happened in the comic. personally i hated the cdc end because it took the hope out of the series. In the comic no one knows what happened, why it happened, or if there trully are safe places in the world. By revealing the reason and result of the zombies you take away the mystery and hope factor for these characters. So much of the comic is based on keep going for hope of a better world. Anyways, Lori preggo thing is weird how they played it in the show. I thought the same thing as you when the doc whispered in ricks ear. He took the blood test, he would know. Of course in the comic shane dies very early on. As in while they were still in camp. In the show he is still alive. im guessing that they kept him alive because they want a bigger confrontation about it being shane's baby.
Last spoiler. - I am willing to bet anyone that Merle is going to be the govonor. He wanted to take charge early on in a forcefull way. His racisism will play interesting with the rape scen with michone. Also the obvoius hand being gone will give him perfect reason to cut ricks off later on. Plus they were all in the same area. It would make perfect sence that they would end up close by. For the people that don't believe because the govonor was mexican, don't put too much in that. They changed plenty from the original comic. added new characters, went new places. i don't think they will double think for a second changing his nationality. it never really had much play in the core of the story so they can easily change it.",1295913600,2,1696,4.2215384615384615
4293760,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Very impressed with what amc is producing.  This show had me from the first episode. Way pumped for season 2.  Breaking Bad, another amc show is also amazing.",1295740800,,158,4.607142857142857
4293761,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"I liked the series, even though it does have a few problems.

The computer graphics in some places (namely blood splatters) could use a little work.  I liked the explosion in the last episode, it looked very realistic.  The characters are generally believable and well-played.  The storyline is interesting and doesn't feel contrived - most of the time.

Which brings me to my main dislike:  the contrived.  ***Spoiler below***

***Spoiler below...you have been warned...***

The main character, Rick, is trying to find his wife and son.  They've been separated for three weeks.  The wife, Lori, is alive at a camp with the main character's partner, Shane.  Shane leaves the hospital and tells Lori that Rick is dead.  Within the three weeks after this news, even though Lori is portrayed the rest of the show as a loving and faithful wife, she sleeps with Shane.  When Rick returns, Lori is back at Rick's side, is angry at Shane, and wants nothing to do with him.

To me, it feels somewhat contrived, as if there wasn't a point of conflict in the story and something had to be found to build on.  I understand that it's the apocalypse and ""he's not coming back"" and all that, but, if she's as faithful and loyal as she is portrayed, it would take alot longer than two or three weeks to get over her dead husband.  The fact that zombies were running loose throughout the countryside would probably be enough to keep me from wanting sex with anyone for some time, and certainly not in an open field.  But, that's just me.

***End Spoiler***

Anyhow, I enjoyed everything in the series except that one bit.  I took off one star for the main point of conflict being a bit contrived, and for the price point they've put it up at.  It is a bit expensive for what you get.",1295395200,12,1767,4.560509554140127

4293763,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was riveted by this series. It was fantastic and the quality of every aspect about it made it quite cinematic. It never felt like a television show.

Every zombie movie touches upon the difficulties of adjusting to life once society breaks down. However, in those zombie movies, they are only able to devote a few moments, out of the 90-120 minutes, to that enthralling subject.

In this series they go through a painstaking detail about what it's like to lose your family, dealing with ""dangerous"" survivors, the logic of racism when there is no longer a real race left, sacrificing survivors for the betterment of the others, how to maintain a family and raise children in an apocolypse, figuring out the vulnerabilities and behavior of the zombies, and whether life is really even worth living in such a bleak world.

The zombies are pretty much secondary since they just exist to create this stunning landscape to establish a top notch drama. This is as good as anything that could be out there. Even my wife, who would never willfully watch a ""zombie"" movie, was totally engrossed by this captivating drama.

This is a ""perfect ten"" of a piece of entertainment!",1295222400,40,1168,4.796019900497512

Get over it kids, it's just the world we live in now, twenty dollar cds and fifty dollar tv shows are par for the course now.

Anyway, this is a truly superb show, one I would recommend to zombie fans and dramatic tv fans alike. All signs show that fans of the comic won't be so jazzed, but nothing new there.

They're lumbering around outside your home, putrid flesh rotting from their bones, and the stench of death emanating through the boarded up doors and windows.  This is the idea behind The Walking Dead.  From the first scene of the first episode, you're pulled into a post-apocalyptic world of flesh-eating corpses.  However, this series is not all blood and guts.  It focuses very much on the psychological aspects of a zombie apocalypse, which can be incredibly terrifying in itself.

It's about time a good horror series is on cable.  It seems like every one dies (pun totally intended) well before its time.  For the horror genre to be so huge, it certainly doesn't have lasting power on basic cable.  I hope we see a long life from The Walking Dead with many seasons in its future!",1294444800,5,882,4.75

We're now concerned with our next meal and a safe place to lay our weary head. Will you survive or not? Can you trust the people around you, including your own loved ones? This series is based of a comic which I've not read. However, I think the characters of the show are extremely well developed, the special effects, acting, etc...are well done, and I'm often eagerly waiting to see what will happen next. I'm hoping next season will be longer, as it's often the case the first ones are short. I want to see what will happen to Rick Grimes (protagonist), his family and friends. At every turn there is possible danger, a macho rivalry for control, the need for weapons, losing loved ones, suffering, love, etc...

Having experienced so much zombie media, I feel fairly content saying that this is one of the best I've seen.  It's short, only 6 episodes, but you already knew that.  The important part is that there is a lot of important things in those 6 episodes.  Normally, in my experience, it takes at least a seasons for a TV show to ""find it's groove.""  Weather it's trying to establish characters, setting up multiple plot lines, or filling out the backstory, the the truth is that there normally just isn't enough time to get everything set right away.  The Walking Dead seems to have bypassed this.  After only 6 episodes, I was already attached to the characters, cared about the blots, and felt like I understood a lot about the world the show takes place in.  I think the most important thing to understand with this show is that it isn't a zombie movie with people in it.  It's a drama with zombies in it.  The survivors and their thoughts and feelings and relationships are the focus, and the zombie apocalypse is mearly the backdrop driving the show forward.  This makes for a show that is watchable by both fans of the genre such as myself, and people who normally wouldn't give a zombie movie the time of day.

With a second season coming out late next year, I'm excited to see what we're in for with more than 6 episodes to work with.",1293753600,,1442,4.437262357414449

The Walking Dead was THE sit down and shut up t.v. event of the year.  All naysayers were immediately silenced when the cinematic masterpiece of a pilot, 'Days Gone Bye' aired Halloween night.  The critics fawned, the audiences cheered, and the social networking machine became as ravenous as a rotted corpse shambling along looking for it's next meal.  Frank Darabont(director/screenwriter of Shawshank Redemption) brought to life, a nuanced yet brutal retelling of the first few issues of The Walking Dead comic series.(penned by Robert Kirkman, drawn by Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard) Somehow the comic series that has won the Eisner for best continuing comic series, was put on an even higher pedestal by the brilliant transition into television that not only shattered all previous cable t.v. records for viewership, but has already been nominated for dozens of awards including the Golden Globe for best t.v. series.(note: not best NEW series, BEST t.v. Series)

Some people are complaining that the price on the Blu-Ray/DVD is too high for only 6 episodes, but I ask you this: how many television shows have EVER been this powerful in a mere 6 episode season or even a full first season for that matter?

If you love blood and gore, this is the show for you.  If you love tense love triangles, this is the show for you.  If you love slow and nuanced drama, this is the show for you.  If you love fast paced violent action, this the show for you.  If you love gripping character development, this is the show for you.  If you love damn good television, this is the show for you.

I was hooked! It was scary at first with so many questions you want answered like what happened? Where is everyone? Ok, so they just left him there at the hospital? Can't spoil it for others but....

Needless to say I became a fan and looked forward to purchasing the weeks episode on Amazon. I was able to watch the episode with ease instantly with no trouble, the only problem ......waiting a WHOLE WEEK for the next episode!! It's so good your actually scared that the writers will get lazy and the excitement will die down but it hasn't and I hope it won't. For everyone who's not a sci fi fan or into zombies don't worry this isn't your typical sci fi strictly guy series. It has romance, character development, hot steamy affairs :), just the right amount of action and suspense mixed in with a little bit of blood and gore but perfectly done not exagerated and not unbelievable. You get to see the desperation of the characters, the relationships they develop with each other, the lies between them and the way they each view life and survival. It's really more about trying to save the remaining human race and well not die in the process. The cast is great, looking forward to finding out what happened with the father and son who helped the sherrif.

Amazon on Demand: I have bought several episodes, shows, and rented movies via Amazon and on my movie rentals have had trouble here and there with viewing such as pausing, stopping, etc but Amazon has voluntarily without my asking refunded the purchase price whenever there was a problem.

However, I found the show to be completely uninteresting, not scary, and poorly acted (I notice that ""bad acting"" is one of the Tag Suggestions below) with terrible dialogue. The Walking Dead is based on a comic book, and perhaps the adaptation was too true to the original: everything about the show seems two-dimensional, and I can imagine it working in a comic book, but it falls flat on the screen. The characters are introduced as archetypes (at best) and stereotypes (at worst) which is a necessary short cut of the comic-book genre, but is just lame on TV. And the direction is manipulative: by episode 2, I could tell that the ""suspenseful setup"" was going to end with a, ""oh good, it wasn't a zombie, it was another member of the party sneaking up on her!"" I purchased the whole season on Amazon On Demand, and by the end of the first episode, my wife and I were left wondering what the heck was supposed to be good or interesting about this acclaimed program. I said I'd give episode 2 ten minutes to provoke my interest, and I watched beyond the point of disinterest, for about half of the episode, and realized that I was just wasting my time. My wife had been insisting ""it must get better!"" but I remember hearing about people loving the show after the first episode, and it just did not appeal to us at all.

4293780,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I have been reading ""The Walking Dead"" for 3 years now. This show is actually based off the Graphic Novel, written by Robert Kirkman, which you can find here on Amazon and any book store out there that stock graphic novels.
 The show truelly brings justice to the comic in every way, from the direction, to the acting, everything is spot on. I really hope people take the time to watch, and/or, read the graphic novel. This is more than a ""zombie popcorn flick"" you would normally expect from hollywood. Infact, to my understanding, other than maybe resident evil, and 28 days later, this story actually takes the zombie thing seriously.
 This story will bring out your human emotions. Through seeing loved ones turned to zombies, to making friends who you may have to kill later, even sometimes seeing the young forced to grow up fast and forced to kill other zombies or maybe those who are not infected, but pose a threat to thier family. The Walking Dead, is just simply an amazing adventure of human survival, told through the eyes of an author who decided to make a realistic, and sensible approach, towards something we've laughed and joked about for over 30 years. Where as before, zombie storys were left for the teens, and only seen as junk food for the brain, this time around, its as serious as a heart attack, atleast, in this story it is =D.
 So, do yourself a favor, and check this story out, in either print or film.

4293797,3,B0049P1ZZQ,"After six episodes ""The Walking Dead"" has failed to impress me much. The premise it begins the series with is nothing new - the protagonist wakes up in a hospital after an unexplained zombie outbreak - and does little to defy genre conventions thereafter. The plot is unfortunately predictable and the characters are cartoonish cliches. The zombie apocalypse itself doesn't even look that bad. Everyone is remarkably clean, well fed and in good health - especially the characters who have Hollywood good looks. They always look flawless. Survival is apparently not that hard in ""The Walking Dead"", because no one ever breaks a sweat or messes up their nicely styled hair. Special effects also have room for improvement. While the zombie makeup is good, the low quality CG sticks out and the sound effects are WAY over the top. Maybe next season AMC will give the show a larger budget and they can replace those ridiculous looking blood splatters. As a whole, ""The Walking Dead"" hardly compares to prior zombie apocalypses entries like ""28 Days Later"" and Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. Hopefully the longer 13 episode season will allow Frank Darabont to craft a narrative that isn't quite as ham-fisted and unimaginative as this 6 episode miniseries turned out to be. However, I can't help but feel that this would have been so much better as an HBO production with a different director at the helm. AMC isn't willing to get as gritty as the material requires and Darabont doesn't seem to understand what makes a good zombie apocalypse. As novel and exciting as a zombie themed TV drama is, ""The Walking Dead"" turned out to be quite flawed, uninspired and ultimately disappointing. Worth seeing, but in no way does it live up to the hype.",1292198400,10,1748,4.849498327759197

Each episode treats zombies not only as a threat but also as the dead, and by that I mean, we, as humans, have a need to respect the departed.  We need to reconcile what we've lost with how can we survive.  This show illuminates that struggle, some characters succeed, and some fail but it's all good.",1292198400,3,465,4.435294117647059

1. If blood in the eyes/cuts, etc. can turn you, why does the goofball with the crossbow continue to wipe arrows (target arrows by the way) off on his pants time and time again? And why does the sister continue to hold her dead, BLOODY, sister, with blood all over her face, arms and clothing? Is she immune?

2. If they need transportation, why not grab one or two of the thousands stranded on the roadways? Are they price-shopping for a better deal?

3. Why do they have to be in or near Atlanta? Why not move away, far into the country, away from once populated areas? Or maybe Barstow...nobody goes there unless they have to.

There are some shows who put out box sets of full 22 episode seasons that don't charge that much.  I give AMC credit for putting the entire season onto one disc but I am not going to spend this kind of money.

While the zombie horror element is there its still basicly man vs nature in this case a pathogen or similer. The human condition does not change just becuse the enviroment does and it was refreshing to see that even when survival was on the line hatred like meryls rasict manner as well as internal conflict was alive and well. Its not the zombies  that make this a stand out show for me its the human interaction. I have never seen the graphic novel. But have seen aid workers taking fire during Katrina while trying to help out with bodies rotting in the streets Angola and Balad in 2007 was not much diffrent.

4293812,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I found this series by accident while I was looking online for something new to watch. My first reaction was no way, there cant be a tv series about zombies, but then you see there really is. Your next thought becomes why didn't someone do this sooner?

Overall this is a very good series with a few small flaws on the side. AMC has shown they are one of the best when it comes to making award winning tv series and I'm sure The Walking Dead will also follow that trend.

Where this show slips up a bit is balancing the story and people with the action and zombies. If you go into this show expecting the same as you get out of a video game or other zombie movies, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, they seem to spend a little too much time on the characters and not the action, which can make things boring at times. What makes this show good is the fact that its not just another zombie movie with endless action, but they need to find a little more of a balance.

The characters are good all around. They are put into a impossible situation and do a great job of acting that out. I saw the wife beater, the racists, the love triangle, and on and on. They did a good job of mixing it all into the main plot and the actors do a great job with it.

Where AMC slipped up a bit is in only having a 6 episode first season with nothing more coming till next October (unless something changes of course). I don't think anyone believed a zombie show would turn out as popular as it has, and the fans are rabid for more, which means the ten month delay is going to turn some people off.

However, I was severely disappointed in the picture quality of the DVD.  The first scene looks like it was filmed on a flip camera, and sadly doesn't improve much from there.  They might have been going for ""gritty realism"" but this is almost to the point of pixelated.  ""Jaggies"" with camera movement, highly distracting, I've seen better home movies.  This looks like a third-gen VHS.  I would have been better off just burning a DVD from my DVR drive.  Reading other reviews I found Blu-ray customers with similar complaints, so I'm glad I didn't shell out extra at least.

That being said, the extras are meaty and worth every penny.  Sad to say though I'm not terribly tempted by the promise of a ""limited edition"" in October unless they clean up the picture a little.  This show deserves better.",1291680000,2,979,4.622093023255814
4293815,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I am disappointed in many of the departures this series has made from the graphic novel, as well as the oversimplified characterizations of many key characters. This series would have been much better if they had stuck to the original script and if they had made their characters less ""Hollywood"" and more real life (Dale).

I won't mention any spoilers. But if they had been faithful to the script and strayed less into bizarre areas, such as the politically correct inner city gangsters, this show would be truly epic.

But I have to admit this series is well done. I can understand that TV is not the same format as a graphic novel and departures had to be made. I think the only real complaint is that the first season was criminally short. It was hard to develop many of the characters, and feels about a third of the way through what a full season should be.",1291680000,5,864,4.496815286624204
4293816,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"I've been reading the ""Walking Dead"" series for several years and was pleased to hear that it had been adapted for TV.  Like the comic, the show focusses on the emotional impact of the zombie plague on the human survivors... There is some violence, and some gory gross-out stuff, but for the most part the zombie ""walkers"" are in the background, an ever-present, overwhelming danger but not the main focus of the drama.  There is already some plot divergence from the books, and I'm still waiting for some of my favorite characters to show up... But for the most part, this is a satisfying, suspenseful zombie epic, and is a nice compliment to the original graphic novels.  I'm looking forward to seeing where they take it from here... So far, so good!  (Joe Sixpack)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSTSCRIPT: After Season Two came out (which totally rocks!) I went back and watched this season again, this time on the DVD release. I really was surprised to find that the DVD edition _edited out_ the gruesome, graphic sequence in the episode ""Guts"" in which the Rick and Glenn chop up a zombie corpse and coat themselves in its gore and viscera in order to ""pass"" as zombies themselves in order to escape a zombie herd. It's one of the most genuinely horrifying scenes in a zombie show that goes to great pains to elevate itself from being a mere splatterfest, but it's also one of the greatest dramatic successes of Season One -- it's a horrible scene which really makes the stakes of survival feel visceral and real. Editing it out was lame. The third disc of bonus features also deserves some comment: the ""black and white"" version of Episode One seems pointless, and doesn't really look that good. (Whatever.) But the ""making of"" featurettes are fun... Overall, I found the DVD release to be more enjoyable than the streaming video I bought when the show was new - no buffering issues or visual jumps. But the decision to edit gross stuff out seems pretty bizarre, if you ask me.",1291680000,4,2051,4.913294797687861

The experience I get when watching this show is much more like being immersed in a really great film. Or a really great book. I have never read the graphic novel, but now I will definitely check it out.
The characters and the character development are magnificent. Thoroughly believable and impossible not to empathize with.
The camera-work, the environment, the lighting and the seamless effects are very immersive. It makes me feel like I'm there, and the characters help me feel what it is like.
The show is dramatic, but in the most realistic way. Their life IS drama. From putting a bullet in a zombie's head to having to put a bullet in your own sister's head when she becomes a zombie. When the walking dead take over the world, people aren't fake anymore and the drama becomes survival, but still holding on to hope.
And then there are the zombies. EPIC. The make-up work and special effects are phenomenal. I have seen ALOT of zombies. I am a zombie fan. LOVE zombie movies. These guys nailed it. I not only love the zombies visually, but I love their concept. Sure, the superfast, superhuman zombies can be cool if done right, but zombies who don't really run any faster than the average person are so much more realistic.

4293821,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"This review is based on the show itself. My review on the dvd will come when its released which I just pre ordered..

The show of course based off the hit graphic novel by Robert Kirkman and it follows Officer Rick Grimes after he wakes up from a comoa to find out that zombies have taken over and now he must he find his wife and son.

The show does a great job adapting the comic to the small screen. Adding some new storylines and characters, as well as changing the fates of some to add new conflicts to the fold. You still have most of the major characters. What makes the show really good for those who read the comics (which I have), they have new characters. So at times I don't know the fate  of them. Will they live, will they die..if so when and how.

They did however leave out to me 4 characters (a husband and wife with their 2 young twin sons however the character of Carol seems to be a mixture of her character in the comics along with the wife mentioned). I didn't really care for the redneck brothers who aren't in the comic, but not knowing their fate leaves me intrigued.

This show does what so few comics have done, made an adaption that works. I hate that season 2 won't start till Oct. of 2011 but I will have the dvd in March to keep me entertained till then. Expect my review of the dvd when it hits stores in March.",1291593600,2,1343,4.15
4293822,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Wow.  A very short first season comes to a surprising end.  After becoming addicted to the graphic novel, I was definitely filled with mixed emotion when I heard a television series was in the works.  I rank the graphic novel with the highest marks possible but was not sure how it would translate when presented in episodic television format.  I do admit readily, that I was disappointed by the extra characters which were not in the novel, i.e. Dale and Merle, what would they possibly add to the story, I think they perhaps put Merle in so that he can re-emerge at some later time, unexpectedly.  If you have not read the graphic novel, just pick it up, read a portion of it and you'll see why it was green-lighted for TV.  It is otherwise brilliant.

Now in the season finale, they do away with a character or two, I guess which is why there are extras put in in the first place. The doctor in this episode is convincing and yes, I did shed a tear or two.  I cringed a little when Shane tried to explain himself to Lori during a drunken moment.  I wonder how much longer his character will last.

If you are Walking Dead graphic novel fan, you know that by now, Shane (Rick Grime's good buddy) should be dead. Also Carol's abusive husband was not a character in the series but was spoken of as a memory or a flashback, if you will, when Carol is opening up to someone, I believe it was Lori. Rick never told Morgan (guy in his neighbor's house after he returned after his coma) that he would continue contact via walkie talkie.  I will not spoil it too much and just say, read the novel, dude. At this point in the story for tv, someone is pregnant. Woops, I had to drop that in in case you needed more incentive to continue watching. Although this is a different animal, it is still Robert Kirkman's creation, perhaps a test tube or birthed by a surrogate but it still has his DNA and therefore, I will stick around to see how the story-lines are treated.  Will the governor be appearing soon, Michonne? When and where? Who will they cast?

I appreciate that the ""walking dead"" are not supernaturally strong beings as in other zombie movies or stories.  That just doesn't make sense.  If dead tissue were somehow reanimated, why would it return from decay and death to be even stronger and sturdier than when it were alive and well.  That simply doesn't make any sense.

Curiosity, if nothing else, will keep me in for the long haul! So many twists and turns, possibilities to expand on the original story as outlined in the novel.  I have been won over and hopefully, they will keep me coming back for more every week.",1291593600,,2624,4.41995841995842
4293823,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"Here's what I think of the Walking Dead series, if you cba to read the whole thing I sum it up in the end :)

If your looking for a zombie series that's strictly all about brain bashing, bloody gore, mindless violence. This is not the show for you. All the bad reviews about the Walking Dead are from people who expect the show to do nothing but bash some zombie brains running around shooting up everything they see in sight.

Truth is the Walking Dead is more about the living aspects to a zombie infected world. As I can recall, there was one episode where only two zombies died. Yes, if you think that's not enough gore for you then you should opt out of watching. But for many others it's so refreshing that there's a zombie based television show that ISN'T all about gore and action. The series explores complex human relationships and mental states of a group of humans who are thrust into vile situations. It truly is fascinating how they are put into various scenarios instead of the standard cut and paste Hollywood zombie film of:

1. Oh no zombie breakout
2. Find a bunch of survivors together
3. Escape to some remote location or find a way to destroy all the zombies and resume life.

The first few episodes do have a lot of character building and will probably bore most people, but when the zombies do come into screen WOW it's on a grand scale, great make up, mass zombie mobs. The series explores assorted situations that I've often wondered ""what would I do if _____________ happened"". That I think is why I find this series ground breaking, it focuses a lot on the living instead of the dead.

******
In conclusion this series thus far is mainly focused on the human relationships and the difficult decisions they have to make. The acting is superb and when a character is going through an emotion (usually sadness lol) you can really feel for them. The standard zombie killing is pretty gory and awesome but you have to be patient for those scenes, as for now the series is in it's infancy and will get much better (I hope lol).",1291593600,3,2049,4.467914438502674

All the bad reviews about the Walking Dead are from people who expect the show to do nothing but bash some zombie brains running around shooting up everything they see in sight.

Truth is the Walking Dead is more about the living aspects to a zombie infected world. As I can recall, there was one episode where only two zombies died. Yes, if you think that's not enough gore for you then you should opt out of watching. But for many others it's so refreshing that there's a zombie based television show that ISN'T all about gore and action. The series explores complex human relationships and mental states of a group of humans who are thrust into vile situations. It truly is fascinating how they are put into various scenarios instead of the standard cut and paste Hollywood zombie film of:

1. Oh no zombie breakout
2. Find a bunch of survivors together
3. Escape to some remote location or find a way to destroy all the zombies and resume life.

The first few episodes do have a lot of character building and will probably bore most people, but when the zombies do come into screen WOW it's on a grand scale, great make up, mass zombie mobs. The series explores assorted situations that I've often wondered ""what would I do if _____________ happened"". That I think is why I find this series ground breaking, it focuses a lot on the living instead of the dead.

******
In conclusion this series thus far is mainly focused on the human relationships and the difficult decisions they have to make. The acting is superb and when a character is going through an emotion (usually sadness lol) you can really feel for them. The standard zombie killing is pretty gory and awesome but you have to be patient for those scenes, as for now the series is in it's infancy and will get much better (I hope lol).",1291593600,4,2049,4.467914438502674
4293825,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I thought I was over zombies. I was wrong, and I found that out half way through the first episode of The Walking Dead. Like the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" all really great zombie pictures have been ""life boat"" stories: Strangers trapped in a confined space surrounded by danger. That means that at the heart of the story are the emotional dynamics between the living characters, but one character is going to really stand out; in The Walking Dead, that character is Sheriff Rick Grimes played by Andrew Lincoln. From the very first scene we know that he is a vulnerable man with heart and emotional pain, a man who must have entered law enforcement to help people, and rises to the need of the moment. Andrew Lincoln portrays Grimes with subtlety and depth. By the second episode I was hooked: I really cared about Rick, and then about his family, and finally about the circle of people whom he comes to lead. Not since Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) in Lost have I felt this connected with a character. I am SO looking forward to season 2!",1291507200,3,1047,4.544973544973545
4293826,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw the previews for this show prior to Halloween (2010).  I was blown away and hooked after the very first episode!  It was so well done, realistic and the acting was stellar!  The zombies and special effects were awesome and the gore was where it should be.  What impressed me was how the show captured the true emotions of people in the unique circumstances that these characters were thrown into.  You could identify with the characters and what they were feeling.  I also liked the rollercoaster of emotions that you felt for certain characters.  At first, you can't stand certain people, then you like them, then you loath them and later they do not seem that bad...  I began telling all of my friends about this program and they loved it too.  Being from Atlanta, it was also interesting to see all the locations that I could recognize.  In my opinion, the series began to lose a tiny bit of steam around the ""Vatos"" episode.  You have to watch to see what I mean.  The CGI could also be improved and may as the budget increases.  The CGI for the zombie headshots was fine, but the explosions were pretty bad.  For example, the grenade in the last episode was pretty weak and the final explosion of the building was laughable (Will not be specific so that I do not spoil anything).  These are picky little details that can be ignored.  This is a 5 star show and I will buy this season for sure!  There were a lot of loose ends at the end of the first season that I wanted to see, at least touched upon.  For instance, what happened to the black father and son who helped the main character?  I really liked those folks and wanted to see more of them.  What happened to the racist jerk from the roof?  Normally I would not care since you have to assume that they will be in season 2.  Unfortunately, there are rumors that Frank Darabont may drop the official writing staff and pursue freelance writers instead.  This would be a horrible idea since it would kill the continuity of the story and characters (If every episode was done by a different writer).  Watch the movie ""The Signal"", which was also filmed in Atlanta and you will see what can happen when you do this kind of thing.  This show is a gem and I really hope that they do not ruin it!

Unlike the other reviews here, I am going to review this episode, Wildfire, from Season 1 of The Walking Dead.

I really liked the episode. Great acting early while drama is going on over the death of a sister. Really good example of what emotional response such a circumstance could bring out. More development in the affair triangle. Great moment of tension when Duane is considering taking Rick's life. And an amazing cliff-hanger. So excited about this series.

Amazing effects by the latex master Greg Nicotero, we are talking truly SICK undead characters that will stay with you, to memorable kill sequences that will have you rewinding just to see that flesh-ripping scene one more time.

The acting involves too much acting and there are not enough zombies. The main characters sit around and mope far too much as they apparently wait for the studio to hire a semi-competent writer who could liven things up. The pacing is pretty much exactly the same on Survivor.

It feels entirely contrived.",1290988800,,470,4.595238095238095
4293841,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"""When the dead walk, our only hope is each other."" is one of the show's promotional tag lines. Except that sometimes we're a pretty crummy bunch of folks. AMC premiered THE WALKING DEAD on Halloween 2010 and breathes a different sort of life into the zombie apocalypse sub-genre. Robert Kirkman - from whose comic book series this telecast is adapted - won't be rolling over his grave. First, because he's not dead. Second, because AMC does his baby justice in terms of capturing tone and themes. The first episode (""Days Gone Bye"") drew in eight million viewers. That means it's a hit, yo.

As in Robert Kirkman's comic book, it's not about the zombies, not really. The zombie infestation serves as the bloodcurdling backdrop, yep. But the focus is on human drama, the highs and lows that man will get up to when the world ends around him. Sheriff's Deputy Rick Grimes is the central figure, mild-mannered and competent and clearly our point-of-view character. After surviving getting shot in the line of duty, Rick wakes up in an abandoned hospital, and we won't get into whether this sequence was ripped off from 28 DAYS LATER or not, because, really, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS did the hospital wakey-wakey bit first, and did it decades ago. Rick soon enough learns of the zombies, or as the father and son duo who takes him in calls them: the ""walkers."" Horrified at what the world has become, Rick nevertheless sets out to find his family. It's what you and I would do, right? He heads for Atlanta, rumored to be the site of a refugee camp, except that the rumor is all kinds of wrong. But if you weren't yet certain that Rick was the ""hero"" of the piece, then that iconic image of him on his horse wandering down a desolate highway probably did it. Positively John Wayne, that was.

It helps that the special effects and the make-up work are so very good. You don't struggle at all with the believability of the shambling revenants. So the bits with the zombies will satisfy the goreheads. But this show, much as in Kirkman's comic book, explores the human condition as it tracks those few humans left. Inevitably, values will be compromised, that underlying social contract sidestepped. If this show follows the course of Kirkman's arc, you're in for dark roads ahead. Getting too fond of the characters isn't advised. Some of them aren't in for a long stay. Some of them will change. Expect several heel turns.

There are powerful moments. The first episode alone (""Days Gone Bye"") offers three searing images. We see Morgan Jones (Lennie James, from JERICHO) sighting thru his rifle telescope as he searches for his undead wife. Later, we gaze at a horrifying aerial view of zombies swamping a tank inhabited by a cowering Rick. But maybe the most memorable scene has everything to do with Rick's returning to the park and to that crawling torn-in-half zombie woman. That moment, strangely enough, maybe encapsulates what this show is about. Despair and empathy.

It's zombie melodrama; it's character driven. I hope the slow burn approach doesn't throw you off. I do think that some of the characters are plucked from clich city, and the featured love triangle is all kinds of old, and that the last four episodes aren't as gripping as the first two. But never mind. As embodied by English actor Andrew Lincoln, Rick Grimes, in his stoic, quiet way, is a compelling character. Born in London, Lincoln emulates that southern drawl quite nicely. (Maybe I'll refrain from mentioning that Andrew Lincoln's real last name is Clutterbuck.) My second favorite character, by the way, is Glenn who is just a likable dude. There aren't a lot of chuckles in this series, but Glenn provides moments of levity.

Visceral and graphic, zombies don't quite usher in the sexy the way vampires do; zombies instead bring the icky and the missing bits. But AMC and all involved have put in the work and what they've done is add prestige to this often dismissed genre, sort of what TRUE BLOOD has done for vampires and DEXTER, for serial killers. THE WALKING DEAD is a contemplative - and, sometimes, ponderous - doomsday saga. It is despairing and devastating and, if you keep watching and if it lasts long enough, will shatter your heart a bunch of times. The Walking Dead, if you haven't gotten it yet, doesn't only refer to the zombies.

Lastly, I like this show very much, but damn if I'll spend the asking price ($25.99) for a DVD with only six episodes in it.",1290988800,3,4453,4.724581724581725
4293842,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I am a huge fan of the graphic novel, so when I first heard this series was being produced, I was understandably stoked about it. Thus, I was rather disappointed when I first started watching the series and saw how many...artistic liberties and creative discretion was taken by the show's producers in writing the series.

Strangely enough, that disappointment did not last very long as I saw each episode, the changes still kept within the realm of plausibility while also keeping the tension and drama that characterized the comic book original.

Certainly, I have gripes with many of the changes. Andrea's age, for instance, was certainly an uncomfortable point for me when I saw how drastic the character was changed. The nature of the zombies too, disheartened me to a certain extent. I was expecting the slow, shambling, ambling zombies generally mindless and working on a pack mentality. So when I saw the series zombies were the aggressive, highly functional zombies, I was rather uneasy with how the series would end up.

Nevertheless, despite the misgivings I have for the changes made between the series and the comic itself, I can say that this show has been worth every penny I've shelled out so far to watch it. The acting is sufficient to sustain the tension and drama, and for the purposes of a tv show, that should be enough. The focus, therefore, is on the plot, and that is well written, well paced, and in general, true to the nature of the source material.

The acting, the feel of the locations, the dialogues, the make up everything is of the highest quality. It stays faithful to the main principle of the zombie genre: Are the living worse than the dead?. This group of characters show that even at the end of the world as we know it, humans cannot stick together and forget conflicts. Zombies, at least are consistent, kill and eat!...that's all. You fear the living more than the dead, the real tension comes from the characters interactions and issues. Of course, the zombie killing scenes are top notch, gory and the exact amount of brains splattered on the screen. But you won't see great athletic feats or technology, just a bunch of very regular people trying to stay alive. Episode 4 is so far my favorite.

shocking brutality of the action scenes when they do turn violent and it would be a short-lived series if the focus was

the series seems to be pretty well written so far. These are hard characters for the actors because they have to project

This particular episode brings out the complexities of personal relationships and the painstaking efforts to exist as well, in a group atmosphere. With each day comes a new battle and a new beginning or end, and sometimes both. Trying to hold on to ones past and at the same time exist in the now, even when someone close to you is dying a horrific death. We the viewers continue to watch as we see the development of both good and bad in each person and then also accept those characters who appear to be above reproach.

I sincerely hope we never have to find out but I do wonder. I think Andrew Lincoln, (Rick) has a lot of compasion for the living and the dead. Although he does some things that confuse his son Carl. For example, how can he go back to a city infested with zombies, leaving his family so he can help a bad guy. Carl has to be my absolutely favorite character.  He is cute as a button. Just imagine what a child that age must be going thru. Leaving his home, the security it provides, school, and everything he knows. Not knowing if his father will return and then what the future will hold.  A little less gore would be nice but if you watch some of the popular cop drama episodes I have actually seen worse. Like Chandler Riggs, (Carl) once said when asked that question, he replied,""I know it's fake and just pretend. It really doesn't bother or scare me."" So if it doesn't bother a child that age that sees it every day, I guess it shouldn't bother us!!!!",1290297600,3,1090,4.251207729468599

4293862,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I read the first 12 issues of Robert Kirkman's epic graphic novel The Walking Dead back in 2006. Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead-Compendium-One/dp/1607060760/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead: Compendium One</a>. As of today, Kirkman has published 80 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).

What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of seasons ahead if this AMC TV series stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first season. And I think AMC must be quite pleased with how the show is shaping up because prior to the launch of the first season of only 6 episodes they renewed a second season of 13 episodes that will begin filming in early 2011.

Director/Executive Producer Frank Darabont with Kirkman oversight have brought The Dead to life in surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. Has the TV series already taken some liberties? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! This just could be the best new show on TV.

The Walking Dead begins the story of Police Officer Rick Grimes as he wakes up from a coma after being shot months ago in a normal world. And ironically his waking throws him into a nightmare of a land that has been devastated by an apocalypse of The Dead. The beginning of the story starts kind of the way the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000XJ5TOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;ended and the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>&nbsp;began...with the lead character waking up from a coma in a world gone mad.

Family gone. Friends gone. Civilization...all gone. Officer Grimes ventures out to find only a handful of survivors at a time. The entire world seemingly has been overrun by vicious hordes of the undead. But as the story matures, it is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.

You'll find unfathomable chaos and horror in The Walking Dead as well as a hypothetical look at human nature in a new world: hordes of zombies, along with human survivors in desperate situations that do the unthinkable to stay alive (or entertained).

The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama that will have you screaming for more after this short 6 episode season ends. But the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to catch up or get ahead.

Well, I just finished watching the first 3 episodes of THE WALKING DEAD and must say I am impressed if not overwhelmed. I think it's a real measure of how much series television has improved over the last 15 years or so that a show like this, which probably would have blown me away had it come out in 1995 or so, now merely strikes me as significantly above average. On the whole it's a solid show, although I find there is an overreliance on foreshadowing that is counterproductive to the effects one should be trying to achieve in the horror/thriller genre. Having said that, I must commend the creators on putting together a great-looking series with credible performances and artful dialogue. The most intriguing to me, I think, is the reiterated theme of the inability of people to get along at the precise time when they most need to; if you don't think that's a relevant topic for a contemporary show, you need to turn off the entertainment and turn on the news.",1290038400,6,1053,4.542105263157895

2 some years later here we are and I have to say YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO NOT WATCH THIS. Some may brush it off as oh...it's another zombie movie. Its really not. The story in the comics and in the series is focused on human reaction and character in the face of a zombie apocalipse. Yes there are zombies, Yes theres everything you can expect from a zombie movie but the deeper meanning of this shows lies within character development and the way they interract in the face of desperation.

Potential SPOILER!

The story deviates slightly from the comic book. The author did not originally think there would be such a HUGE demand for this thus tried to get through his story in order to avoid cutting the story short.
The director of the film worked with the author and developed the story a step further where there was room. As a result there are a few extra characters in the story thus far but I am sure they will die off in order for the story to move along to its next step.

the potential spoiler is that in the comic, the author builds up a group of survivors and then due to a tragic attack many of them die. this happens on numerous occasions. so be prepared for a wild ride, and DONT MISS THIS!!!!",1289692800,2,1413,4.206642066420664

4293881,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"When is the last time you cried during a zombie movie? Honestly, AMC's new series ""The Walking Dead"" (based upon the successful cultish graphic novel series) is, after Breaking Bad and Mad Men, their third show poised to be a remarkable and heavily awarded television series. Graphic in its gore content and violence, the pilot nonetheless presented a plausible and terrifying ""end of the world"" tale that is surprisingly personal with moments of great poignancy.

The central character, Georgia Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, is shot nearly fatally spending a long (unknown) amount of time lying in a coma, awakening from it and, barefoot and clad only in his hospital gown, stumbles through and emerges out of the hospital to discover a world devastated by some mysterious catylcismic event; a world nearly devoid of life.

Once again a fairly unknown British actor takes the lead in an American television series, but having watched Andrew Lincoln as Rick in this series, I fully believe the guy was made for the role (or the other way 'round). For nearly 70 minutes, Lincoln's Rick is mostly on his own, but his face - a magnificent mirror registering every emotion from self doubt, fear, grief, utter despair but also the hope of finding his wife and boy. Lincoln's is a tremendous performance of made all the more remarkable considering the genre and thus a rare opportunity for subtlety and introspection.

Rick's interactions with another father and son who capture, but ultimately rescue and aid his return to health, has a deep resonance in a world where men are considered stulted in understanding or expressing their emotions (a topic which is introduced nicely in the shows opening scene with Rick and fellow officer Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal).

Lorie is too timid, too thin, and has too weak of a persona so far.  In addition, all the drama with the locket was silly and would have killed it (plus I don't think anyone has obnoxious lockets like that in the last couple of generations).
Another thing is that the camp is way too spread out...they need to be closer together for safety (same with the thing in the woods-- there is no way, they were doing it in the tent where it made more sense in the comic book).
Glen wouldn't be panic-ed making death comments about climbing a ladder; he had more guts and liked what he did (the thrill/adrenaline -- he doesn't seem to have it here).
There are also characters that I don't remember, and I'm not a big fan of the racism/sexism that they added in.  Also, Rick shouldn't have taken leadership by force -- especially so early like now, because he is way behind the others on the learning curve of what is going on (having just woken up and shown up), and beating up one of a group (even if the guy isn't well liked) is stupid because you are the outsider so they are less likely to trust you and more likely to do something to you for it.

They do a fabulous job of creating a rich scene to see details in. Watching the first episode a second time allowed me to see some cool details I originally missed.

I'm looking forward to more episodes and I've been impressed with the massive scenery that has been created for the scenes (or maybe its computer generated, I cannot tell if it is). Either way, I'm looking forward to the next episode when I get Rookered. You should get Rooker rocked too by Michael Rooker. Fabulous Actor.

I enjoyed this very much, and am greatly looking forward to future episodes. Highly recommended!",1288828800,6,563,4.371428571428571
4293899,5,B0049P1ZZQ,I wished for a worthy show to come down the pike for a long time. I hope this show will deliver. It looks great so far!,1288742400,,119,3.6153846153846154
4293900,4,B0049P1ZZQ,I heard about The Walking Dead series back when the San Diego Comic Con was going on and AMC had released a trailer.  I was blow away this seemed like a drama with zombies.  When I watched the first show I was not disappointed it had drama and zombies and it did not try to over whelm you with either.  I just had a problem with a couple of scenes that it why I thought it was 4.5 stars and not 5.  I won't mention the scenes to keep spoilers out of the review but lets just say that I could not suspend my disbelieve for those two scenes.  If you like your zombie shows with some drama and good acting and action then The Walking Dead is for you.,1288742400,2,647,3.9461538461538463
4293901,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I've always been a fan of the zombie genre but I get disappointed when I see a bad zombie movie and there are a lot out there. My favorite zombie movies are Night Of The Living Dead, 28 days later, Dawn Of The Dead (original and new), Zombieland and Dead Snow. Zombieland was a pleasant surprise, I didn't think it would be such a good zombie movie being comedy also. When I heard that there was going to be an actual mini-series made about zombies I instantly became stoked, but after I found out it was an re-imagining of The Walking Dead comics I about fainted. I think the first episode of T.W.D so far has stayed loyal to those films and The Walking Dead comic but at the same time while being its own entity. In my opinion you can't go wrong with Frank Darabont as the director and then the producer of both Aliens and Terminator movies. I am extremely excited about this show so far and cannot wait for the second episode, ""Guts"" to come out this Sunday. I recommend you watch this show immediately !",1288742400,,1007,4.333333333333333
4293902,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"The pilot exceeded my expectations. It's cinematic, tense and dramatic. While this episode does not introduce many characters aside from Rick (and Shane in a way), they did it really well. I cannot wait to meet (again) the Atlanta camp survivors in the next episode (Glenn!).",1288742400,,275,5.0
4293903,4,B0049P1ZZQ,"Although it starts off kind of slow, it does pick up.  From what i watched it is a very interesting adaptation of the Zombie flicks that aren't all about gore.  Some of the parts are a little graphic, might not be the best for young kids but all in all a good show!!!!  Can't wait for more.",1288742400,2,290,4.052631578947368
4293904,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was looking forward to this show starting, but with cutting back on my budget, decided to rid my household of cable and dish.  But, I love the fact that I can get some of my favorite shows, or in this case what will soon be one of my favorite shows on amazon.  The show was great.  Really started liking the characters right off the bat and am excited to see where the story goes.  I am not familiar with the graphic novel, but will definately check into it after watching the show.  Can't wait for the rest of the season.",1288656000,4,524,4.148514851485149
4293905,5,B0049P1ZZQ,"I was absolutely delighted to find that ""The Walking Dead"" was available through Amazon Video on Demand. I purchased the first episode last night and watched it with no problems on my Roku.

This episode was fantastic - good pacing, good characters, and a surprisingly sympathetic/human protagonist. So far, the show appears to be more than JUST about survival, which is essential to a successful drama. However, the action segments were also exceptionally well done, as were the zombie effects. This is definitely a show that warrants continued viewing...",1288656000,,556,5.247191011235955
