8454981,5,B00534OHAM,"BORAT (2006) is easily the wackiest movie made in many a year. It's extremely politically incorrect, kinda juvenile in spots and just one huge laugh, that is, if the insulting of Jews, women and ""retards,"" or seeing a nude 400 lb. guy in all his flabbiness won't put you off your popcorn.

The full title (Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) gives a sense of how our hero, as portrayed by Londoner Sacha Cohen, fractures the English language. Kazakhstani TV reporter Borat was originally one of three Cohen characters on the half-hour BBC-TV comedy series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DA-ALI-G-SHOW/dp/B000JBXH82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DA ALI G SHOW</a>&nbsp;(2003). This movie expands on his anti-Semitism, misogny and penchant for misspoken scatology as Borat films a documentary of his travels across America from east to west.

Borat is based on an incredibly funny doctor that Cohen met while in southern Russia. Those of us who appreciate a good belly laugh are truly grateful for this chance encounter.

Erran Cohen's fanciful national anthem ""O Kazakhstan"" has a tune and lyrics that immediately invade your brain. Here are two of its less-objectional verses:

Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan you very nice place
From Plains of Darashik to Northern fence of Jewtown
Kazakhstan friend of all except Uzbekistan
A very nosy people with bone in their brain

Kazakhstan industry best in world
We invented toffee and trouser pants
Kazakhstan's prostitutes cleanest in the region
Except of course for too many scars

Extras on the DVD include outtakes (some good, some really boring) and a collage film of Sacha in character enjoying a new-found American fame that was at near-mania levels back in 2006.",1379462400,2,1795,5.532846715328467
