3597177,3,B001G6OML0,This was evidently the early days of the program.  Howdy referred to Buffalo Bob as Mr. Smith and the show was set in a circus atmosphere and not more western as the later shows became.  There are a lot of commercials which I thought were odd.,1356480000,,243,4.260869565217392
3597178,3,B001G6OML0,"I enjoyed watching the video but I can't believe that this was ""the best"" of that long running show.
Rather than just raw footage of old shows it would have been nice to have some context on the evolution of the program and the development of some of the puppet characters. At least the price was very modest.",1350172800,,309,4.344827586206897
3597179,5,B001G6OML0,"All potential buyers should be aware that these episodes are also included in the 40 episode box also sold by Mill Creek. I did not know this and bought both, only to discover that two discs on the bigger set are duplicated from this set. There was no way to know this ahead of time, as Mill Creek's website did not list the episodes on the 20 episode box. So don't buy both sets, unless you are buying one for yourself and one for a friend or family member.",1268265600,41,458,4.157303370786517
3597180,5,B001G6OML0,"I purchased this for my brother's 60th birthday. (I also bought one for myself.)

3597182,5,B001G6OML0,"It is what it is. And who can say anything bad about Howdy Doody.
 I did seem to recall it was a much grander production when i was a child.

I say it is clear and quality copies if these classic shows",1471305600,,201,3.761904761904762

3597187,4,B001G6OML0,"This is the old b/w series that I enjoyed as a child. It was fun to reminisce with this DVD. The quality is the same as I watched in those days. If you want to see those old programs again or share them with your neighbors or grandchildren, then this is for you.",1436918400,,262,3.9622641509433962
3597188,5,B001G6OML0,"The video plays just great.  Brings back so many memories.  My brother recently purchased a vintage Howdy Doody ventriloquist doll for me for my birthday. I had mentioned to him ""in passing"" one day, when we were just talking about ""Old times"" that when I was a little girl, I had actually thought Howdy Doody was a real little boy,  I loved his freckles and red hair.  And the guy I married actually was a red-head w/freckles. And shared the name of Bob Smith (Buffalo Bob). We both had a really good laugh about this.  ""Karma?""  Anyway, he kept that thought to himself for quite awhile and decided that's what he would give me for my birthday.  This video, I found on Amazon.com, was a perfect addition to my vintage puppet......it will take me some time to actually view the nearly nine (9) hours of shows contained on this video. But they sure are fun to watch and reminisce.",1435622400,,879,4.490566037735849

3597194,5,B001G6OML0,I purchased this item to show my granddaughters one of the programs I watched as a child. They loved it and always ask me to play it when they visit. They laugh at the skits of Howdy and friends just as much as I do. I really enjoy watching them have a good time while they view Howdy Doody.,1398988800,,291,3.9491525423728815
