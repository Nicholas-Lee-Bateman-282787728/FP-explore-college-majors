1636547,5,B00005NQGO,"I saw Journey of Man in IMAX and was very impressed by it.  The wonderful Cirque du Soleil acts we have become accustomed to are as good as ever and set as they are in beautiful landscapes, they become even more beautiful in a surreal but intimately familiar way.  From the grace of an underwater ballet to the lively banquine, every act is a gem.  I especially liked the dance of two human marble statues with the theme of ""Love"".  In addition, the soundtrack is inspiring and lovely.",1028678400,9,485,4.4772727272727275
1636548,3,B00005NQGO,"I received this as a surprise, just in time for my birthday. How excited I was as I plopped the disk into my DVD player and sat back in joyous expectation of an hour or maybe 90 minutes of the sort of pure entertainment found in other Cirque du Soleil titles. We put a pizza in the oven. By the time the pizza was done, so was the damn film!
Journey of man is a visual feast for the eye but a famine for content. It is beautifully filmed in natural settings that appeal to my Pagan little heart. Moving from the sea, to a forest, to a rocky desert, it is visually entertaining. We move on to what appears almost like a Roman villa with classical  statuary, which turn out to be performers who deliver an impressive strength demonstration. Then we move on to a stylish set that might conjure in the mind a more modern estate for the closing performance.
The problem is, that closing performance comes surprisingly soon. I was taken aback at how quickly the whole thing was over and done with. I thought I must be mistaken. I grabbed the shuck and checked the table of contents. Nope. There were no lurking ""additional"" scenes. No expanded version. I checked the running time, and it claimed the whole thing should run appx 39 minutes.
39 minutes! That's a grand total, folks. 39 whole, complete, total minutes! That includes the credits.
As I sat, feasting on pizza, I was disappointed right out of my skull with the famine of content found (or should I say 'not found') in Journey of Man. It was like a bad case of ""visualis interruptus!""
Meanwhile, the basic premise that everything would be simply peachy if the world would break down and embrace ""dreams, faith and love"" struck me as horribly naive. How Septermber 10th! It is nearly as Pollyanna as Bush's claim our economy is fundamentally sound!
Caveat Emptor ~ the film is great visually, too bleeding short and stingy of content, has a message to deliver that is inherently juvenile and only 39 total minutes.
Being armed with this information, you make your own decision. It is a mixed blessing, feast or famine.
Investing in this DVD is the electronic equivalent of purchasing WorldCom or Enron stock!
Personally, I strongly recommend other titles in the C du S line.",1027814400,22,2227,4.5814536340852134
1636549,4,B00005NQGO,"The best video production of a Cirque de Soleil I have ever seen. The reason it gets 4 stars, because it's only 32 minutes long. I was still on my popcorn as the movie ended. It felt that the producers robed me. This DVD should have been called a trailer but not the whole feature. Otherwise it's so beautiful that I had to play it again. A word to the producers, please release part 2, and make it this time at least an hour long, let me finish my popcorn.",1027468800,12,457,4.088888888888889
1636550,4,B00005NQGO,"The most important thing to understand about this DVD is that ""Journey of Man"" was originally created for an IMAX 3-D presentation.  I saw it in the theaters and was blown away, and so I bought the DVD as a reminder of that experience.  The sound on the DVD was spectacular, drawing out the beauty of the soundtrack, but there are inherent limitations on the visual side.  Because IMAX's aspect ratio is close to that of a TV, there's no need to letterbox this feature, but there's no way to capture either the size of the IMAX screen or the 3-D effects that made it so spectacular.
All of the acts were taken from the various touring Cirque shows:  The opening ""Taiko"" from Mystere, some synchronized swimming from ""O"", ""Cube"" from Alegria, ""Statue"" and ""Banquine"" from Quidam, and so on.  I'm not sure that there were any original acts, but each of the performances here has been further stylized and put into a setting that frees the act from the constraints of the stage, making each one larger and more powerful.  ""Statue"" is especially striking, as the performers in full-body grey makeup perform on a vivid green leaf floating in a black pool.  The colors are beautiful throughout, and the performances are, of course, spectacular.  The acts are connected by sequences that were amazing on the big screen but feel a little bit unnecessary in the living room.
The storyline explores the ""child-like wonder"" theme of previous Cirque productions, but I think that the theme is both better portrayed and has more of an impact here than I've felt in Cirque's other work.  There are all sorts of amazing things in the world if you keep looking, and what you think you want isn't always what you need most.
Basically, this DVD is a good buy for rabid Cirque fans who need to have everything that Cirque has produced, people who never got a chance to see Mystere, ""O"", or Alegria and so can enjoy some acts they haven't previously seen, or for those of artistic bent who don't mind shelling out the money for a 35-minute presentation of beautiful staging and cinematography.  I fall into all three categories and am very happy with my purchase.
However, EVERYONE should see this in its original IMAX 3-D format.  On the big screen it truly is an amazing spectacle throughout.  On the small screen it's more of a novelty.",1018656000,41,2319,4.670761670761671
1636551,4,B00005NQGO,"For the fan of Cirque, consider this the video equivalent of a souvenir program: beautiful but too short and too expensive.  Let's face it, Cirque is best experienced live. Second best is ""The Journey of Man"" in IMAX 3-D. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it really took advantage of the 3-D format to not only showcase acts but also tell a story, all through the typically remarkable vision and design of Cirque's creators. The only thing that video offers over live is good multiple camera setups and editing to give you many points of view. On the multi-story IMAX screen Journey's visual effect is dazzling and the sound thunderous. Friends gave us the DVD for Christmas and my first question was, ""does it come with the glasses?"" Sadly, no. So at best, the Journey DVD is only a reminder of the 3-D IMAX experience, as any Cirque video can only be a reminder of the actual performance. But after all, I still leaf through my souvenir programs years later and I still watch the videos. How could I not? Cirque in any form is amazing.",1010188800,2,1032,4.578378378378378
1636552,1,B00005NQGO,"I am a Cirque du Soleil fan and waited eagerly for the release of the Journey of Man.  With the hype and previews, I expected this one to outshine the recent others.  Much to my dismay, not only was it about half as long, but had only two acts I considered equal to their reputation.
Much of the time was taken up with scenes and music that are common to many a movie/performance.  I normally love the story lines that accompany the performances, but this one spent way too much of the already short time on ""nothing"".
The two performances that were worth veiwing were still not enough to make me want to keep the video.  I sent it back.",1007251200,8,637,4.283333333333333
1636553,3,B00005NQGO,"If you are a die hard Cirque Du Soleil fan and must have everything they put out, like me, then by all means go out and buy this DVD.  If not, I would strongly recommend you pass on this one.
Why you ask?  Well, lets start with the fact that it is (dollar amount)and is only 35 minutes long, and it's not even in widescreen.  There are only a few acts and they are very short.  There are no acts in this show that aren't available in their full length in other videos or DVDs.  Even the soundtrack is copied from other shows, with the exception of ""Journey of Man"", which is a great song, but is much better (and is complete) on the audio CD.
There are a couple of pros, though.  The audio seems to actually be 5.1, not 5.0 as specified on the box, and the quality of the video is quite good, once you get past the fact that is in 4:3 format.  The scenery is spectacular, it is nice to see a rich background to the acts (as apposed to the scafolding of the big top).  And it is a cute story...
With a little more effort, this could have been great.  Unfortunately, it's, well... not...",1005523200,76,1085,4.104265402843602
1636554,4,B00005NQGO,"Cirque du soleil is one of the most intriguing artistics statements in our society today.  This particular piece, as seen in 3-D Imax, makes a provocative, tasteful introduction to what Cirque represents.  The scenes are wildly colorful and poignantly dramatic, so much so that it brought tears to my eyes!  My only wish is that the DVD would ship as 3-D as well.  If you have a chance to see this in IMAX do so before you watch the DVD.  You will NOT be disappointed.",998438400,8,468,4.458823529411765
1636555,5,B00005NQGO,"I saw ""Journey of Man"" in 3-D and felt I could catch the Banquine flyers in my lap.  The movie is the next best thing to a live Cirque du Soleil show, even though nothing compares to the being there.  The soundtrack, written by Benoit Jutras, not only proves to be a great background for the film, it is great to listen to even without visuals.  I hope this movie is eventually released on DVD.",988934400,42,394,4.226666666666667

1636570,5,B00005NQGO,"Over the past years I have come to appreciate the
human circus known as Cirque du Soleil.  The troupe
of performing jugglers, contortionists, acrobatics and gymnasts
dressed in incredible costumes never fail to elevate the human
spirit.  Cirque du Soleil is unlike anything experienced before.

The artists of Cirque du Soleil appear in this wondrous film,
Journey of Man, originally shot for Imax 3D.  Smoothly narrated
by Sir Ian McKellen, the film is presented in my liner notes as
a fantasy that follows the stages of human development from
birth to maturity, with each stage presented by a Cirque du Soleil
act such as bungee-diving through giant redwoods, synchronized
swimming, cube spinning and human balancing.

The single biggest problem with Journey of Man is its silly,
incoherent story which is the reason I couldn't quite describe
it in my own words.  Where the real focus should have been put
on the Cirque du Soleil performers, things get bogged down
with a rather shallow storyline.  Still, most of this can easily
be forgiven when you consider the visual impact this film offers
its viewers thanks to its amazing acrobatics and other human feats.
It's just amazing to watch these acts of human endurance.

This is a film that shines beautifully in 1080 HD for the fact
that it was shot on location in beautiful locales.  You'll absolutely
marvel at the synchronized swimming sequences shot underwater
in the island of the Bahamas and the bungee-diving sequences lensed
in Boulder Creek, California.  The transfer offers abundant clarity and
revealing detail that make these backdrops look magnificent.  Costume
colors are often vibrant, leaping out at the viewer, and black levels
are quite good -- especially in the sequence involving the cube spinner.
To really appreciate how detailed this transfer is, one only need to
look at a sequence performed in the middle of a pond with its water
that looks like shimmering glass.  Just one of many beautiful backdrops
for the viewer to soak in.

While originally conceptualized and shot for 3D, I am a bit at odds
as to whether the process really elevates the film itself.  I think this
film would have worked equally well in 2D as the process of adding
depth to the film only slightly enhances the overall visuals. There
are oh-so-brief moments where heads, arms or shards of a broken
hat move out towards the viewer.  However, for the most part, most
of the visuals remain confined inside the screen.  The process makes
for an interesting 3D experience but not an outstanding one.

The soothing musical soundtrack from Benot Jutras sounds clear
and crisp across the front channels with the rears giving support to
chorals as well as atmospheric effects.  Turn the volume up and
you'll find the soundtrack to be a satisfying, encompassing experience.
Beautifully lensed, Journey of Man makes for a rather intriguing HD
experience for fans of Cirque du Soleil, though the 3D process doesn't
necessarily enhance the viewing. For what it's worth, I would have rather
seen the filmmakers skip the cornball story and just stick with the
performances instead.

Sadly, I am not confident that this title will appeal to those not
appreciative of Cirque du Soleil, however with this 40-minute 3D Blu-ray
reasonably priced at under $14, it may make for a compelling purchase --
perfect for the entire family.",1453075200,,3362,4.992831541218638

1636573,3,B00005NQGO,"I have always wanted to see Cirque du Soleil, so I thought here is my chance, watch a 3D movie of one of the versions! The quality of the movie was really great, the plot line was not for us.  We expected it to be more acrobatic, we never even finished watching more than 30 minutes of it.

I did enjoy seeing how our new 3D television would look. The production of the movie was top notch and it was amazing to see some of the acrobatic moves in 3D. The moves themselves were few and far between and it seemed we just watched the same thing over and over again.

I wish I had more information for you, I do not like to ruin the plot of a book or movie. But if the plot is so lost it can't be seen, even in 3D, I have to recommend that you spend your money on something else.

I enjoy reading product reviews and, in turn, try and write one for my purchases online. I ordered this movie on Amazon and paid full price for it. ",1446508800,2,925,3.9516129032258065

1636623,3,B00005NQGO,"Typically, Cirque Di Soleil is a non-stop dance, song and acts of skill.  This attempts to keep that spirit, however looses its momentum repeatedly and becomes a little awkward and lacking traditional flow.  In a typical stage show there are musical interludes between acts but the show stays alive throughout, even in act transitions, this does not have that spirit and energy.

The costumes, make-up and acts continue to be stellar, but the real life atmosphere takes away the magic although providing a new way to see a show.  Not to mention, the music is not as memorizing as other shows.

It is unique in 3D and new concept for cirque video, however if you only intend to see this in 2D, this is not a show worth spending the money on.",1378944000,,740,4.575757575757576

The 3D Blu-Ray version of Journey of Man takes you into a place where movies cannot go.  I won't reveal the experience, but as with all CdS shows, there is a mix of water, acrobatics, and the ubiquitous characters who communicate with non-verbal gestures.

Actually it is a quite nice production with very good use of 3D as part of the production but not as a gimmick.  It is understandable why some were put off.  The 3D is used but is not stressed.  I found only two scenes that ""pop"" out of the screen (in an overhead shot in the living statue dance when the man lifts the woman into the air and, the end, when the hat hits the book exploding it into flying pieces).  There were some shots in which it seemed that the action was intentionally kept within the frame of the image.  The performances were not filmed on astage/arena with most using little or no rigging.  It shouldn't be compared with a performance since it was shot much more like a film, mostly if not all, on location.

1636684,5,B00005NQGO,"First let me say that there is 3D and then there is 3D.  I have purchased and enjoyed this disk using a Samsung 61 inch ""3D Ready"" DLP TV.  This is an important distinction.  My TV uses the ""checkerboard"" format rather than the 3D Blu-Ray standard.  This checkerboard format is, in most respects, superior to that which you get on the new 3D TV's.  This may account for the negative reviews from owners of the newer sets.  The 3D is also superior to that which you saw in the original IMAX 3D theatre release.  That is because theatres use passive 3D glasses rather than active. The difference in depth is substantial.  The 3D, for example, in ""Polar Express"" is disappointing even in IMAX, but, placed on the home screen, is dramatic.  Having said this, I can report that the friends with whom I have watched this on our system are simply amazed.  This is Cirque as it should be.  I have some quibbles with the way they have depicted the ""Journey of Man"", but these can be reduced to artistic differences and the film should be enjoyed on its own merit.  I would also say that I have lent the film to friends with the official Blu-Ray format and the results are no where near as good.  We are at the mercy of decisions made by big corporations.  From what I have been able to read, the checkerboard format was too expensive to incorporate in plasma TV's, so it was abandoned. Plasma was not as good as DLP, but corporations had huge investments to recoup.  So, they sold it to the public.  We are all the poorer for this. (Please note: Mitsubishi still offers checkerboard and all new Panasonic Blu-Ray 3D players now incorporate this technology.  I believe that this is a bow to its superiority for the home viewer.  You will find both on Amazon.)  In any event, this is good news for ""3D Ready"" set owners and lovers of Cirque. For folks who own other technology, try it.

1636692,1,B00005NQGO,"I am a fanatical fan of Cirque du Soleil, and I was waited eagerly for the release of the 3D Blu-ray
version of this Cirque du Soleil Journey of Man.  When I received it, it was played on a
58"" Panasonic Viera 3D Full High Definition TV + a Panasonic Threatre Sound System combined
with an ORB Audio System; but still I was dismay about the 3D effects qualities of this disc (need to
say that that I can't bet of receiving a dude copy).
Unliked to the Cirque du Soleil stage show, the underwater swimming synchronization was
excellent but its surrounded environment was that cloudly as if it was videotaped in a dirty cow-
trough; the forest captures were as if made by a cheap filmmaker's camera; and only fair few other
parts of the movie pertaining to rocky & hilly natural scenery were in 3D effects (but in depth
ONLY, never came out of the screen); and the beautifully related ""Journey of man""story lines that
accompany the performances was cramped into a 39 minutes ""Much Ado about Nothing"" dull
movie with seasonal 3D effects.  As I see it, Cirque Du Soleil had been discredited by the release of
its performances in that 3D version.  My recommendation to mainstream 3D filmmakers are to
stick to creature-features movies when trying to convert 2D into 3D; because you are all hell bent
on 3d-ing old 2Ds movies instead of producing fresh 3D Blu-ray movies from the start; I would say
that there are so many family-friendly movies in the last decade, hence I also know that most
filmmakers are turning to already created creature-feature 2D movies that they can convert into 3D
Blu-ray movies; and at least their created 3Ds do look better that this one I am reviewing now with
a 1 STAR rating.
N.B.: To buyers I would suggest you do keep your hard-earned dollars (even your wilfully-earned
dollars are worth keeping) for better 3Ds and leave this one on the distributors' and/or retailers'
shelves; no offence to amazon.com because that will not stop me purchasing all my 3D movies from
amazon; take my advice and Have A Nice Day.",1310774400,2,2039,4.642659279778393

1636694,5,B00005NQGO,"I almost missed out on this gem
This is the blu ray 3d version not blu ray
Whoever said it's 4:3 is wrong
It's 1:78 wide screen but of course will show up full screen but Its not 4:3 geez what IMAX film is geez - 4:3 IMAX lol - not!!!
Read back of case - I did actually

It's not a stage performance - many stunning locations - the color is rich and the 3d is jaw dropping

Disregard what others say - I love it !!! Not a big cirque fan either and this is magical and beautiful

If u have a 3d tv - don't miss this masterpiece
Even the last scene is breathtaking !!!!",1310515200,2,567,3.788135593220339
1636695,5,B00005NQGO,"The combination of a great philosophical theme, beautiful scenes, fantastic athleticism, and that, coupled with 3D, makes this the best Cirque du Soleil that I have ever seen.  It is a fully emotional trip that brought tears to my eyes.",1309392000,,236,4.9
1636704,4,B00005NQGO,"The story content is a bit esoteric and underlying vision development requires patience on the part of the viewer but the performances are unworldly.  The 3D cinematography was spot on as you would expect from Cirque.  I'd give it 5 stars except for the short length.  I did have trouble, as did other reviewers, with getting it to work on any of my DVD players - 2D or 3D.  Even the third copy sent only works on my 3D player though Sony proclaims it can be played in 2D.  Perhaps, they meant it can be played in 2D mode on a 3D player.  Anyway, If I could give 10 stars to Amazon Customer Service I would.  They replaced the first two defective discs by overnight delivery no questions asked.  Kudos to the best customer service department of any out there.  I usually place my orders with Amazon direct even though their price may be a little higher than that offered by other sites.  The experience with this affirms that choice.  Thank you Amazon!",1308700800,,952,4.445086705202312

I tried it also on my pioneer blu-ray burner and it did not play properly. The quality of the blu-ray disc seems much cheaper than the others that I have - disc is very flimsy.,1308528000,,339,4.0

1636707,1,B00005NQGO,"I purchased this from amazon and it would not play on both a sony and samsung 3d bluray player.  It would either eject and say disc error or load forever, or occasionally make it to the menu, but the movie would only play for a few seconds then lock up.  Even though I've never had a bad dvd or bluray before I thought that particular disc must of been bad.  I sent it back to amazon and they sent me another brand new one.  Guess what?  Same exact problem.

Sony also makes the swimsuit sports illustrated 3d bluray and it plays fine along with all my other 3D and 2D blurays and dvds.

The few seconds I saw of the film between it locking up did show great 3D and was really pretty to look at, I wish I could watch the whole thing.",1308009600,,733,4.048611111111111

It includes the living statues act and the tumbler act,  with their original music.
All of this is woven into a coming-of-age story perfect for all ages.
In 3D it really is beautiful. This is the best 3D disk that I have seen so far. I would suggest that anyone who has the necessary hardware should grab this item immediately.",1307664000,3,401,4.493150684931507
1636709,1,B00005NQGO,"I bought this movie because I love Cirque du Soleil and I just got a new 3D TV.  Aside from some bright colors this seems completely unrelated to the Cirque du Soleil stage show.  It's set underwater, in the woods, etc.  It is incredibly boring.  The 3D effects are not very good.  I think we got through at least half of it fast forwarding waiting for something good (which never came).  It's so bad I'm just going to throw it out.",1307491200,,432,4.271604938271605
1636710,2,B00005NQGO,"Until I purchased a packet of two Cirque du Soleil DVDs, I had only seen it on television. Since I was always impressed by the professionalism, beauty and originality of their productions, I was really disappointed with this DVD. When I got home and read that it was only thirty some minutes long, I thought I had misread it and read it again. In my opinion, the show was also very boring in spots, especially the underwater ballet. The acrobats were fantastic and I was sorry to see their act end.",1292112000,,498,4.483516483516484
1636711,3,B00005NQGO,"The very successfull Cirque Du Soleil decided to lately present its talent on a short film rather than their traditional public show. It was nice watching it on film, however I have the following remarks:

Pros: Very colorfull, talented, nice sountrack, and entertaining.

Cons: Very short (30-45 mins), no story, and lacks singing. I guess it would have been much nicer if it was a musical, such as Moulin Rouge. It could have been a romantic story with some singing and lots of their talented acrobatic shows.",1240012800,,511,4.862068965517241

1636716,1,B00005NQGO,"At the opposite of the C.D.S. spirit. This DVD sounds like an old fashion Hollywood film. They tried to use SFX, but that's really too much and we can't enter the adventure.

There are only 3 real performances, one from Quidam, one from saltimbanco.

The esthetic of the film sounds like plastic. Really too expensive. Uninteresting. Keep your money or let's buy the dvd of saltimbanco, alegria or quidam.",1154649600,2,405,4.855072463768116

1636718,3,B00005NQGO,"This was the film made for the IMAX theaters so as with most IMAX films it is shorter than your average movie.
Frankly I found the begining dull the water ballet slow and not at all entrancing. The rest was lovely but they were all acts that can bee seen on other discs with other shows.
IS the premise  a bit juvenile? Well yes it is but it was made BEFORE 9/11 so in fact it IS very 9/10 as someone arrogantly put it. And frankly Cirque is not an American company so even if this were made after 9/11 why must it reflect the jaded and negative nature that has come to pervade our nations attitude?
This film is a lovely bit of fluff with no extras to speak of and nothing except recycled acts. It was lovely to see once but not worth owning IMHO.  I had no probelm with the narration but it did actually seem somewhat uneccessary the message was there inside the visuals.",1079395200,5,873,4.190476190476191

It was beautifully amazing with 3D glasses and for $10 I didn't mind that it was only 40 minutes long.

1636723,4,B00005NQGO,"I have been fortunate to see live performances of C du S's La Nouba and Quidam which were both exqusite and breathtaking.  The originality that C du S brings to their performances brings out the child in me and every time I see them I am moved.  This is what circus should be about.  I have seen journey of man several times at the IMAX cinema at the Ontario sicence centre and it is only this large screen format which does this film justice all the acts in J of M are wonderful if a little short, but as a 29 year old man it always brings me to tears.  I think I would recomend buying other C du S movies before buying this one, unless you are a die hard fan.  However, I would also recomend not buying any and saving your money to go and see a live performance!
