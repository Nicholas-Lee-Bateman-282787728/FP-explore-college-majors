7062625,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"Written and directed by Ronit Elkabetz and her brother Shlomi Elkabetz, Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem is a fascinating look into something few people outside of Israel are familiar:  the Kafka-esque nightmare a woman has to go through get a divorce in Israel if her husband is unwilling to grant one.  (Note: the word ""Gett"" is the Hebrew word for the divorce document that the husband must present to the wife granting the divorce.)

A bit of background is necessary.  Because of its complex history, Israel's system of marriage and divorce laws essentially date back to when it was part of the Ottoman Empire and only religious marriages were considered valid.  For Jews, that meant strict orthodox rules govern both marriage and divorce.  And because in modern Israel no single political party has enough clout to form a government by itself, it has always been necessary for the larger parties to form coalitions with smaller parties in order to have enough votes to form a government. This gives the smaller parties a level of influence completely out of proportion to their size, in particular the orthodox religious parties. As a result, even though only about 20% of Israeli Jews are Orthodox, Orthodox Judaism has control over all marriage and divorce among Jewish Israelis. There is no secular marriage for Jews in Israel (unless they get married outside of Israel, which many choose to do).  Any application for divorce in Israel goes to a rabbinical court, which decides the matter based on orthodox religious law.  Which makes divorce difficult in general and extremely difficult if one party is unwilling to cooperate.

The film opens in an Israeli rabbinical court where we first meet Viviane Amsalem (compellingly played by Ronit Elkabetz), an Israeli woman who has been trying - unsuccessfully - for three years to get a divorce from her cold manipulative husband of twenty years, Elisha (Simon Abkarian).  Viviane is represented by a sympathetic secular lawyer, Carmel Ben Tovim (Menahe Noy).  Her husband is being represented by his older brother, Shimon (Sasson Gabai), a buffoonish self-appointed lawyer who is nonetheless sly enough to know how to say the things he knows the court's rabbinical judges want to hear.

And what the rabbinical judges really want is for Viviane to quit bothering them and go back to her husband.  With absurdist repetition, the hearing gets delayed again and again when Elisha first refuses to show up, then appears but refuses to cooperate, or cooperates only to delay the process, each delay enabled by the decisions of the judges. By orthodox law, the grounds for divorce are extremely limited, and do not include things like incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, or even mental or emotional cruelty, all of which are manifestly evident in Viviane's unfortunate marriage.  The judges piously claim their hands are tied by the law, but it is clear at every moment that the law and the judges favor the husband. Every session ends with the case unresolved, a quick fade-to-black, and then the trial resumes with a notation reading ""two months later"" or ""three months later"" or ""six.""

Taking place entirely either in the small spare courtroom or the waiting room outside, Gett has a very stark and claustrophobic feel to it, which works in subtle ways to make the viewer feel how Viviane feels - trapped in an endless legalistic maze with a husband she desperately wants to get away from.  The starkness is accentuated by a complete absence of a musical score.  At 115 minutes, the film is not really that long, but the endless continuations from one court date to the next with constant delays and setbacks make it feel much longer, which also makes the viewer feel how Viviane feels, that this nightmare will never end.

The acting is in a word, superb.  Ronit Elkabetz's Viviane is a study in endurance pushed to its limits, pushed to the breaking point at times when she either explodes in rage or breaks into barely controlled laughter at the absurdity of it all, like when her sister testifies loudly and in humiliating detail what her marriage to Elisha is like, ignoring and at times bulldozing right over the rabbinical judges' efforts to shut her up.  Simon Abkarian's Elisha is a more subtle study, done with nuanced facial expressions and telling glances that show far better than words how manipulative he is and how, though he insists he loves Viviane, he has no real understanding of what the word even means.

Note:  Though Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem as a film stands on its own, apparently it is also the final part of a trilogy written and directed by the Elkabetz siblings. I cannot comment personally on the first two films, not having seen either of them, but from what I've read, in 2004's ""To Take a Wife,"" Viviane is a young mother but her marriage to Elisha is already stressed, and in the second film, 2008's ""7 Days,"" more conflict emerges as the extended family sits shiva over the death of one of her brothers.

Highly, highly recommended.",1427500800,54,5041,4.911660777385159

Possible spoilers

Both my partner and I saw this film at the BFI London Film Festival October 2014

Film makers Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz's latest film, is supposed to be the third in a trilogy films exploring male-controlled undercurrents in an Israeli family. However, the viewer need not have seen the other two films to be able to understand the subtext of their narrative. This film was exhibited at the 2014 London Film Festival under the `Dare' category and has since, in the case of the UK, gone straight to DVD.

This production has its attentions zeroed in on Viviane (played by director Ronit Elkabetz) and her five-year journey to obtain a divorce from her husband, after her 15 years of marriage. However, she is forestalled - in that in Israel, there is no a straightforward civil marriage or divorces. For a wife to wish to live her life independently it is wholly reliant on the acceptance of either her husband or the sternly conformist rabbinical courts to agree. This is a film, which at times has ridiculous hilarity of the human condition within the context at hand, and is countered with its heart-breaking humiliations. The filmmakers approach in their direction takes an uncluttered and Spartan approach. The narrative conveys the atmosphere of rigidity in the courtroom - right down to the strict and appropriate dress code. All the film's scenes take place in the courtroom, a small claustrophobic room with white walls. It is the former wife Viviane - who is the key issue of the piece, and Elkabetz's portrayal is one to be applauded - as we see her go through frustration after frustration and her resilience.

One of the themes that really got under my skin was the fact that the court session cannot get underway until the husband is present! By using this stratagem Elisha played by (Simon Abkarian) declines to present himself in court. He uses his influence to delay the court in order to wear out his wife and force her to withdraw her annulment request. In reality this tactic is unfortunately used by Israeli men who want a postponement or curtail a divorce, and is a cognitive act of revenge, or a way to illicit child custody.

For me a `Gett' offers a deeply troubling view of a system whereby misogyny seems, as if it is, codified into the court system.

(02/19/2015) For those interested

A rabbi has gone on trial in the United States accused of plotting to abduct Jewish men who refused to grant their wives a divorce(""Get""). Defence lawyer Robert Stahl argued that his client was acting as an advocate for women and had a reputation for ""convincing these husbands to go give their wives a get"".

The wife of a devout Israeli man who is married to him for 30 years tries desperately to get a divorce but the only way to achieve it is with her husband's consent. The trial goes on for 5 arduous years due to religious restrictions that bound the couple, till the moving and really heartbreaking finale comes.

Ronit Elkabetz gives a stunning performance, subtle at times, intensely dramatic at others.

This film alone defines her place as one of the great actresses to grace the screen. That she co-directed this film only adds to her legacy.",1483747200,,446,4.881578947368421

The only reason I didn't give the film five stars was because it was a bit slow moving although that was part of the cinematic technique of the film maker. I was also not exactly sure of the end which seemed to be very abrupt, perhaps also to make a point.

7062639,4,B00UNEJ2LQ,"We watched this Israeli import purely on the power of Ronit Elkabetz, who stars in two of my all-time favorite movies: ""Late Marriage"" and ""The Band's Visit.""  ""Gett"" feels like a play.  In fact, I researched to see if it was a play first, but does seem like Ms. Elkabetz and her husband/co-director Shlomi Elkabetz wrote this specifically for the screen.

The blatant misogyny of the farce of the justice process on display here will have you boiling over with anger and incredulity. Elkabetz's Viviane -- trapped in a loveless marriage in which her husband no longer speaks to her in the home -- is cast as the offender, slandered with one baseless accusation after another.  Simon Abkarian is particularly good playing Elkabetz's estranged husband.  You know he's good because your bile juice will get flowing watching his heavy-lidded, cold refutations of his wife's pleas.

The subtitles here are easy to follow despite needing to hopscotch between three languages: husband and wife speak French to each other (their families have emigrated from Morocco); and, there's some Arabic spoken between them as well.

Speaking of plays, they made one out of ""The Band's Visit."" I urge everyone to see it.",1480809600,,1202,5.010050251256281

Even though this movie is in rooms that are painted with walls that are probably egg shell white, it never made me feel in any way claustrophobic, on the contrary it made me expand my mind into thinking how other people think and uh might behave when it comes to certain situations, such as being in love with a woman. A woman with dark hair which is long and nothing seems to be working out with her maybe because she wants more? It really made me think about how things are supposed to go with this agreement called mirage between this woman and this man. People in the middle east are really special and how sensitive he doesn't want to let her go and I understand him. I wouldn't want to let her go either, I would like for her to like me too, she's really talented this actress she is particularly spectacular.

7062648,3,B00UNEJ2LQ,The story is all too familiar and maybe it needed to be told to a larger audience. Ronit Elkabetz was always a wonderful actor.

7062664,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"I think the power of this film is dismissed and diluted by the inevitable reference to the Orthodox ""control"" of women. Living inside of traditions that hold off the culture surrounding them is much more complex and nuanced than people outside of those communities can see. I suspect the experience of life in such communities is deeper than any of those caught up in the corporate/technological take-over of the human spirit that is American culture can even begin to imagine. This drama portrayed the mystery of marriage. And it is a mystery. Each quest to understand it (neighbours, family, the couple themselves) showed a different picture. And this is the mystery of all relationships. A drama that struggles to illuminate that mystery is profound and I personally am deeply grateful for it. Marriage is one of the deepest relationships we experience. A divorce trail in a Rabbinical court is a perfect choice to examine this mystery. Contemporary divorce courts in America no longer have any interest in the personal or practical reasons for divorce. They are concerned strictly with splitting assets evenly  (As an aside  that includes children  who are viewed as assets rather than relationships.) I don't know the motivations of the filmmakers, but I would not assume that every drama about the Orthodox community is meant primarily or even at all, to address the perceived control of those within the community. This film calmed my spirit, which is battered and bruised by being treated like a piece of digital information  spied upon, used as a potential market  my every move recorded  my sensibilities constantly bashed with licentious images, screaming voices and electronic noise. To think that people still live deeply personal lives within communities that are thoughtfully crafted is reassuring. I know that I cannot enter such a community  I was not brought up in one  but it nevertheless dispels some of the despair I feel to recognize their presence. I thank those who made this film from the bottom of my heart. It was deeply personal and completely human. That cannot be said about any main stream American film I can recall in the past 10 years.",1461715200,,2169,5.0055555555555555

I so admire that she persevered with so much against her.

He was the best character in the movie. It was very clear that a patriarchal society officiates at divorce proceedings... we get it. What wasn't so clear is the ending. Could have done a better job in my opinion.

7062701,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"An excellent film depicting the anguish that a women must go through to obtain a divorce under orthodox Jewish law in Israel.  If the husband does not agree to a divorce, there is little that the wife can do.  She can appeal to a panel of rabbis, who will try very hard to get her to go back to her husband.  In the film, the wife appears before the panel numerous times over a period of five years with no resolution.  Finally, the husband agrees, but only if she will also agree not to be with another man.  Reluctantly, she agrees just to be out of the marriage.  This film painfully illustrates the superordinate position of husbands in the fundamentalist part of the Israeli society.

7062722,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"While the film is fiction, it portrays and indicts the barbaric system of divorces in Israel that are no better than how women were treated in the Middle Ages. In Israel, only rabbinical courts can issue divorces, but as shown in this film, the rabbis believe they can only issue a divorce if the husband agrees to give the divorce to his wife. A woman cannot initiate a divorce. As a result, husbands can refuse to grant wives divorces leaving them unable to marry. They are chained to their husband for life even though the husband is not living with them, supporting them, and able, under Jewish law, to marry another woman. This situation needs to be changed.
In this film, we see the common occurrence. The wife Viviane Amsalem wants a divorce from her husband who is extremely controlling. There is no doubt that the marriage cannot endure, but the rabbis continually insist that Viviane return to her husband and try to work out the marriage. This goes on for about a dozen appearances before the rabbinical court of three rabbis, for over five years during which time Viviane suffers. Viewers will see how unsympathetic the rabbis are to her situation, how little they know of psychology, and how prejudiced the rabbis are in favoring the male.

7062748,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"It's certainly not a slow movie, and yet it is filmed in such a way that you come to feel the impatient desperation of the woman who wants out of a loveless marriage. I was especially glad to find this on Prime, as I had been unable to get a ticket at the Jewish film festival earlier this year in Atlanta.  The idea of the Gett, the contract of divorce, is removed from the lives of many contemporary Jews who have moved away from more Orthodox roots. Many are satisfied simply to have a civil decree from the county courthouse (I'm speaking of America, here.) But the complete process, when one has had a Jewish wedding, with a Jewish wedding contract (ketubah), performed by an ordained rabbbi under a canopy (chuppah) and then one wants, or needs, to divorce - includes a gett. I have seen the effects with a personal friend: he had an affair, she wanted a civil divorce AND the gett. And she went through months of emotional upheaval trying to get that document out of her ex, while his mistress gave birth to a child less than nine months after the marriage had taken place. I am a Jew, but if there is some part of my heritage with which I can find fault, it is the humiliating obstacle course that women are put through in trying to obtain a divorce through rabbinical court. This movie is a must-see for anyone, everyone, as an eye--opener into the lives of the religious who are unhappily married, and seek a solution.",1444694400,,1428,4.429657794676806

It's a fascinating view of the rabbinical judicial practices and procedures in Israel, of which I had no inkling. Clearly women are less regarded under the law than men. The setting is stark, rarely outside a small white office which serves as a courtroom. The judges never show sympathy but do reveal impatience and anger at disrespect. It was a mystery to me why they kept reconvening the hopeless couple, or why the husband stuck stubbornly to the marriage.

Possible spoilers

Both my partner and I saw this film at the BFI London Film Festival October 2014

Film makers Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz's latest film, is supposed to be the third in a trilogy films exploring male-controlled undercurrents in an Israeli family. However, the viewer need not have seen the other two films to be able to understand the subtext of their narrative. This film was exhibited at the 2014 London Film Festival under the `Dare' category and has since, in the case of the UK, gone straight to DVD.

This production has its attentions zeroed in on Viviane (played by director Ronit Elkabetz) and her five-year journey to obtain a divorce from her husband, after her 15 years of marriage. However, she is forestalled - in that in Israel, there is no a straightforward civil marriage or divorces. For a wife to wish to live her life independently it is wholly reliant on the acceptance of either her husband or the sternly conformist rabbinical courts to agree. This is a film, which at times has ridiculous hilarity of the human condition within the context at hand, and is countered with its heart-breaking humiliations. The filmmakers approach in their direction takes an uncluttered and Spartan approach. The narrative conveys the atmosphere of rigidity in the courtroom - right down to the strict and appropriate dress code. All the film's scenes take place in the courtroom, a small claustrophobic room with white walls. It is the former wife Viviane - who is the key issue of the piece, and Elkabetz's portrayal is one to be applauded - as we see her go through frustration after frustration and her resilience.

One of the themes that really got under my skin was the fact that the court session cannot get underway until the husband is present! By using this stratagem Elisha played by (Simon Abkarian) declines to present himself in court. He uses his influence to delay the court in order to wear out his wife and force her to withdraw her annulment request. In reality this tactic is unfortunately used by Israeli men who want a postponement or curtail a divorce, and is a cognitive act of revenge, or a way to illicit child custody.

For me a `Gett' offers a deeply troubling view of a system whereby misogyny seems, as if it is, codified into the court system.

A rabbi has gone on trial in the United States accused of plotting to abduct Jewish men who refused to grant their wives a divorce(""Get""). Defence lawyer Robert Stahl argued that his client was acting as an advocate for women and had a reputation for ""convincing these husbands to go give their wives a get"".

I think when Elisha finally realized that in order to keep a wife around you must express love not just have it in your heart and that you cannot posses love as you do a object it was too late and the love of his life was out of his life and had completely disconnected from him in every way. Even then, his regard for his own jealousy and ego were more powerfull that the love he thought he carried for Vivian as revealed in the condition he imposed on her in order to give her the Gett. He loved her as his prized possession and his greatest conquest, not as a fellow human being. I think it broke his heart and crushed his ego that she left him. I found myself hoping desperatly for Vivian as she was thwarted repeatedly in her fight for freedom,  feeling her despair and anger and the stinging injustice and degradation she suffered at the hands of the men in authority in her life and I admired her tenacity in persisting until she wrested her freedome from their hands.

7062951,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem,"" directed by the brother and sister team of Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz, is part three of a trilogy made in Israel. Viviane seeks a divorce decree, or get, from a rabbinical court (bet din).  She is estranged from her husband, Elisha, who refuses to grant his wife her freedom.  The three members of the bet din pressure Viviane to return to Elisha, but she claims that her husband is cold and indifferent, and she no longer wants to live with him.  Her attorney, Carmel Ben Tovim, played by the charismatic Menashe Noy, returns to court with Vivian on numerous occasions to plead her case, to no avail.

Elisha, portrayed with steely determination by Simon Abkarian, fails to appear at the scheduled tiime on several occasions.  When he does show up, he stoically states that his separation from Viviane is entirely her fault.  If she would stop being so stubborn, he would willingly take her back.  This seriocomic film has a fine cast of supporting actors, some of whom appear as witnesses for one side or the other.  Their testimony is ofen rambling and irrelevant but adds a dose of humor that helps relieve the tension generated by the Kafkaesque proceedings. As the title implies, it is Viviane, not Elisha, who is being judged.  The implication is that she is guilty for no longer observing Jewish ritual and for not doing all in her power to keep her family intact.

Shlomi and Ronit Elkabetz not only co-directed but also co-wrote the screenplay.  The sharp camera angles and frequent close-ups emphasize the characters' inner turmoil. Carmel Ben Tovim is frustrated at having to deliver the same futile arguments again and again; Viviane is furious with the smug Elisha, who assumes that he will eventually prevail; the rabbis are fed up with both Elisha and Viviane and wish that the two would simply disappear.  Ronit Elkabetz is luminous as a striking woman worn down by a patriarchal system that empowers husbands at the expense of their wives.",1435276800,8,1994,4.83235294117647

7062953,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"Written and directed by Ronit Elkabetz and her brother Shlomi Elkabetz, Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem is a fascinating look into something few people outside of Israel are familiar:  the Kafka-esque nightmare a woman has to go through get a divorce in Israel if her husband is unwilling to grant one.  (Note: the word ""Gett"" is the Hebrew word for the divorce document that the husband must present to the wife granting the divorce.)

A bit of background is necessary.  Because of its complex history, Israel's system of marriage and divorce laws essentially date back to when it was part of the Ottoman Empire and only religious marriages were considered valid.  For Jews, that meant strict orthodox rules govern both marriage and divorce.  And because in modern Israel no single political party has enough clout to form a government by itself, it has always been necessary for the larger parties to form coalitions with smaller parties in order to have enough votes to form a government. This gives the smaller parties a level of influence completely out of proportion to their size, in particular the orthodox religious parties. As a result, even though only about 20% of Israeli Jews are Orthodox, Orthodox Judaism has control over all marriage and divorce among Jewish Israelis. There is no secular marriage for Jews in Israel (unless they get married outside of Israel, which many choose to do).  Any application for divorce in Israel goes to a rabbinical court, which decides the matter based on orthodox religious law.  Which makes divorce difficult in general and extremely difficult if one party is unwilling to cooperate.

The film opens in an Israeli rabbinical court where we first meet Viviane Amsalem (compellingly played by Ronit Elkabetz), an Israeli woman who has been trying - unsuccessfully - for three years to get a divorce from her cold manipulative husband of twenty years, Elisha (Simon Abkarian).  Viviane is represented by a sympathetic secular lawyer, Carmel Ben Tovim (Menahe Noy).  Her husband is being represented by his older brother, Shimon (Sasson Gabai), a buffoonish self-appointed lawyer who is nonetheless sly enough to know how to say the things he knows the court's rabbinical judges want to hear.

And what the rabbinical judges really want is for Viviane to quit bothering them and go back to her husband.  With absurdist repetition, the hearing gets delayed again and again when Elisha first refuses to show up, then appears but refuses to cooperate, or cooperates only to delay the process, each delay enabled by the decisions of the judges. By orthodox law, the grounds for divorce are extremely limited, and do not include things like incompatibility, irreconcilable differences, or even mental or emotional cruelty, all of which are manifestly evident in Viviane's unfortunate marriage.  The judges piously claim their hands are tied by the law, but it is clear at every moment that the law and the judges favor the husband. Every session ends with the case unresolved, a quick fade-to-black, and then the trial resumes with a notation reading ""two months later"" or ""three months later"" or ""six.""

Taking place entirely either in the small spare courtroom or the waiting room outside, Gett has a very stark and claustrophobic feel to it, which works in subtle ways to make the viewer feel how Viviane feels - trapped in an endless legalistic maze with a husband she desperately wants to get away from.  The starkness is accentuated by a complete absence of a musical score.  At 115 minutes, the film is not really that long, but the endless continuations from one court date to the next with constant delays and setbacks make it feel much longer, which also makes the viewer feel how Viviane feels, that this nightmare will never end.

The acting is in a word, superb.  Ronit Elkabetz's Viviane is a study in endurance pushed to its limits, pushed to the breaking point at times when she either explodes in rage or breaks into barely controlled laughter at the absurdity of it all, like when her sister testifies loudly and in humiliating detail what her marriage to Elisha is like, ignoring and at times bulldozing right over the rabbinical judges' efforts to shut her up.  Simon Abkarian's Elisha is a more subtle study, done with nuanced facial expressions and telling glances that show far better than words how manipulative he is and how, though he insists he loves Viviane, he has no real understanding of what the word even means.

Note:  Though Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem as a film stands on its own, apparently it is also the final part of a trilogy written and directed by the Elkabetz siblings. I cannot comment personally on the first two films, not having seen either of them, but from what I've read, in 2004's ""To Take a Wife,"" Viviane is a young mother but her marriage to Elisha is already stressed, and in the second film, 2008's ""7 Days,"" more conflict emerges as the extended family sits shiva over the death of one of her brothers.

Highly, highly recommended.",1434672000,2,5041,4.911660777385159

It must be said that no stone should be left unturned to preserve marriage - for a greater good.  But what if one or both partners entered the marriage in desperate need of living water, only to discover that their marriage was a waterless desert?  What then?",1434412800,,712,4.8347107438016526
7062956,4,B00UNEJ2LQ,"""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" (2014 release from Israel; 115 min.) brings the story of Viviane and Elisha Amsalem's divorce trial. As the movie opens, we are informed that Viviane left her husband three years ago, and that she is now trying to get a divorce (or ""gett"" in Hebrew). Viviane and her lawyer are in court, but Elisha refuses to appear, leading the judges to postpone the hearing. We are then quickly informed it's ""six months later"", then ""two months later"", and then ""three months later"", with no end in sight. Will Viviane be able to get a divorce? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this movie is co-written and co-directed by Ronit Elkabetz (who also plays the role of Viviane) and Shlomi Elkabetz (whom I believe is her brother). Second, 95% of the movie plays out in the court room, and as such is really more of a filmed stage play than it is a movie in the traditional sense. The movie consists is various family members and friends testifying as to why the divorce should, or should not, be granted. Third, most importantly, this movie spotlights the many absurdities of the Israeli court system, at least how it relates to divorce matters. The judges are rabbis and, most appallingly, the true power is held by the husband, who apparently must consent to granting the divorce. Without the husband's consent, not even the court can impose the divorce. In that sense, this movie demonstrates how easily a husband can (and does) abuse his wife psychologically, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. For that reason, I found the movie deeply disturbing, although I am also aware that, sadly, Israel is far from the only country where women are treated in this manner. Bottom line: ""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" is very much worth seeing, but let the viewer be aware: you may likely be pretty upset about what plays out in this Israeli divorce court drama.

I saw this movie in March at the Silverspot Cinema in Naples, FL. The early evening screening where I saw this at was quite nicely attended, which surprised me, given not only the nature of the movie, but also the theater-like style of the movie. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign divorce court drama that will challenge you in more ways than one, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1430265600,22,2451,4.671296296296297

8707588,5,B00UNEJ2LQ,"This movie is about an Agunah. The Agunah (Chained woman) problem is a sad one. Someone wrote this being an Israeli problem, but it also happens in the USA in the religious communities. Yes, a person can get a divorce by USA law, but this isn't a 'gett' (Jewish divorce), if the woman remarries secular (because no Rabbi will marry her without a Gett) it can cause problems for her children. In this movie, the man is refusing divorce because he says he loves her, but it seems more like control.  The movie is very interesting and heartbreaking.",1499212800,,546,4.571428571428571

8707592,4,B00UNEJ2LQ,"This film was very well done.  Even though there are only two scenes, the courtroom and the waiting room, the viewer is completely immersed in the drama.  The acting is excellent and completely realistic: these are dramatic characters we know.  As the film progresses, the dynamics of the couple's relationship emerge.  These are people who hate each other.  The only issue is whether the wife can hurt the husband more by getting the divorce or the husband hurt her more by denying it.  The point of the film is that the rabbinic court prolonged the process of divorce, thereby allowing the husband to continue to inflict pain on his wife.  The film aims to draw attention to this injustice and to contrast Israeli divorce laws with those of western countries where the woman has more of a say.
No doubt, there are cases of abuse, but they are not as widespread as one might suppose from the film.  The couple here had been married 30 years.  So the court's ordering the wife to return to her husband for 6 months looks like an act of compassion.  The buffoonish behavior of the judges was entertaining but not very plausible.  Nor is it likely that the court would release the husband from prison--where it put him for contempt--on his promise to grant his wife a divorce and then release him (and try to wash its hand of the case) when he changed his mind.
Can we really suppose two people to have a quiet, simmering mutual hatred for 30 years and choose to do nothing about it?  Multiple implausibilities undermine the social commentary, but the drama remains compelling.",1486598400,2,1575,4.666666666666667
