8328560,2,B001N9S5XG,It only has 3 songs.  I was overcharged because I wanted a concert and I got 3 live songs and I paid as much as I would have paid for a CD.  I was very disappointed.  It was actually a promotional DVD - it was not what was advertised i.e. a concert DVD with Tim McGraw performing.,1448064000,,280,3.8771929824561404
