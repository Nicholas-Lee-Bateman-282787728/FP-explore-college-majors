7447082,5,B015S12VUM,I bought this concert with high expectations knowing what Devin Townsend is capable of releasing and it didn't fail me.  This concert is amazing.  The image and sound quality is superb.  All the musicians are talented and you can see they enjoy playing together.  Highly recommended to any DT fan or new listeners.,1452470400,,314,4.867924528301887

I just finished watching this DTB Concert on Blu-Ray and I have to tell you it is one of the most amazing concerts I have ever seen.

Let me back up and let you know that I've been a Devin fan since the Infinity Record, but Ocean Machine is still my favorite by far.  I own every record he's been on from Punky Brewster to Lamb of God to Soilwork to Ihsahn.  He truly is a musical genius in song-writing, producing, singing, and guitar playing.

I appreciate the Dark Matters Record played in it's entirety, as this album to me was a bit lacking when it came out because I wanted to visualize what the story was about.  Devin achieved this during this live performance, and I am now even more of a fan of this album.

As for the second half of the concert....the ""fan request"" portion, I can tell you that it is some of the best live performances by a metal act you will see.  Not just because of the musicianship, but because of the ""connectedness"" DTB has to these songs when playing them.  I think it has to do with the fact that some of these are not played live much, and that the fans picked them out and wanted to hear them.

You see a while back, when I heard that he was taking requests for the upcoming live concert blu-ray, i knew that I had to vote for my favorite 3 songs (all on the Ocean Machine Record).  Funeral .... Bastard .... The Death of Music

And as you can see, I wasn't the only one who felt those were some of his best work.  All three songs just have this insane amount of emotion and epic feel to them.  Something that i find lacks a little bit in most of Devin's most recent work....not that I don't like the new material, but there is something about the Ocean Machine Record that just absolutely moves me in a way that I cannot describe.  I feel the pain and emotion of his every note, his every word.

The absolute highlight of this Blu-Ray and is worth purchasing just for this, is the above three songs I mentioned ... Funeral .... Bastard .... The Death of Music.

Because those three songs are one this live blu-ray, I ask you to do yourself a favor and watch the blu-ray before listening to the CDs.  It is a completely different experience I assure you.  Particularly with The Death of Music....

....I have never seen Devin put down his guitar, and just play a song so ""stripped-down"" and full of emotion.  No guitar to hide behind, just he and the audience in front of him.  This is no easy song to sing, and he does it live, after singing other very intense songs for 1.5 hours prior.  Devin was just so full of emotion....no cheesy quips....no fart jokes...none of that during or around this song.

Buy this live concert if you are a Devin fan, buy this live concert if you love progressive metal, buy this live concert if you enjoy music that was written by a musical genius.

Buy this live concert!",1448409600,22,2981,4.288014311270126
8734398,4,B015S12VUM,"Glad this Bluray played fine in my PS4 with US region code. Real awesome performance of DTP. It would have been nice with a 5.1 audio mix like others also wrote, but the stereo mix is a very good one so it doesn't bother me that much. It would have been a full 5 stars though with a 5.1 mix.",1532390400,,291,3.8666666666666667
8734399,5,B015S12VUM,"Truly captivating. I have been a Devin Townsend fan since I started listening to Strapping Young Lad years ago. I saw the Deadhead portion of this dvd on youtube and knew I had to own it, I am not disappointed. My girlfriend and I enjoy watching this together with a bottle of wine. Devin is a genius and the whole band is incredibly talented. Check out DEADHEAD on youtube, then you will know you need to add this to your collection. It is brilliant.",1522972800,,451,4.380952380952381

8734402,5,B015S12VUM,"This concert is freaking amazing, and Devin and crew sound amazing. (I know I know, a lot done with backing tracks and post, but final product is excellent) I had read some people saying vocals sounded low in mix, but Im wathing on Sony gold headphones, and they sound really clear to me. I will have to try it through my system as well, but I think the audio sounds great. Really energetic and fun performance. Dev is hilarious as usual.",1503273600,,438,4.419753086419753
8734403,4,B015S12VUM,"ok, first things - this is a region 0 disc (plays anywhere). The audio track is just lpcm stereo.
The video and audio are good. It is a chronic shame that they didn't mix this for 5.1. Especially with the theatrical aspect of the show a 5.1 soundtrack would have bumped this up to 5 stars.
The first part of this show is a visual rendering of the dark matters cd (or cd 2 of the z2 set). It is very well done, and well worth the watch, even if dark matters isn't a favourite of yours.
The second half of the show is a selection of songs picked by polling fans on what they want to hear. This set is the meat and potatoes of the disc, with a great selection of songs.
The band are obviously enjoying playing all the stuff here and it shows through. I think the band misses anneke helping out on vocals, but modern trickery covers this.
This is very much worth getting if you like townsend's stuff .... i just wish they had added that 5.1 because a good 5.1 would have made this the best bluray disc I own.",1489363200,3,1004,4.101522842639594
8734404,5,B015S12VUM,"Big fan of Dev. This DVD has to be one of the best sounding concert DVDs ever, especially considering how layered DTP productions can be. Everything is spot-on with a seriously EPIC performance. 5 stars all day every day.",1473552000,2,221,4.6923076923076925
8734405,5,B015S12VUM,"This has usurped the title of ""favorite live performance on DVD"" from Godsmack. The visuals, theatrics, cinematography, audio mixing, and performance are all perfect. It looks and sounds so good, I can only imagine what it was like to have been there. The last four songs wrap up the entire performance perfectly, by the end you will be left with a sense of fulfillment and completion.",1463961600,,385,4.848484848484849
8734406,5,B015S12VUM,"Looks, sounds, is, amazing... and yes, it plays on USA Bluray/DVD devices just fine.",1456444800,,84,5.071428571428571
8734407,4,B015S12VUM,"I have the Blu Ray version (a Christmas gift from my wife). This is really a wonderful concert. As everyone else has pointed out the concert was split into two parts. The first Z2 Dark Matter. Complete with guest vocalist Dominique Persi of Stolen Babies doing her part as The War Princess. It's a fun first half as the story comes alive and everyone performs at a top level. At least so far as you can hear. After Dev gives a quick chat about there being a break (although a cast bow with Dominique would have been nice) we're treated to the second half, which as has been mentioned was by fan request. In it we get I think the best selection of Dev's work that he's put out on film yet. Maybe because it has Earth Day my favorite of his, or the inclusion of much of Ocean Machine, but I couldn't dream of a better selection of songs. And musically the band is spot on. An the vocals seem on, but you can't really tell, and this is my complaint for this, the mix is awful and the vocals are buried so far down in it, you can hardly hear them. It's a problem from the first song, all the way through to the last, the music is loud and clear, but the vocals are muddy, murky and lost the ENTIRE time. It take what would be a magical viewing and make it almost as annoying as it is fun to view. The worst part of that is on both the By a Thread box set 4 night series, and Retinal Circus, the mix is perfect the entire time. The music is clear and so are the vocals. I first thought that maybe I was being too picky. But my kids love Dev, and watched the Ziltoid half with me and it didn't take long for them to start asking why they couldn't hear the vocals. And they know the songs inside and out. So in short, it was a great show, and it must have been amazing to have been in attendance that night. And if you're a fan (and it's still available) it's well worth picking up. But it's as disappointing as it is enjoyable. I wish I could say otherwise and give it 5 stars, but I simply can't. I doubt I'm the only fan commenting on this, so who knows maybe they'll remix it and re-release it. The ""Addiction"" DVD on the By a Thread set was defective and those of us who got it were able to get it replaced. Maybe we'll get lucky and this concert with a decent mix will be put out later.",1455494400,2,2285,4.046357615894039
