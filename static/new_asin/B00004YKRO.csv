1374874,4,B00004YKRO,"I worked in Prague for the W.H,O, for several years (from 2000-2003).  A concerted effort was made to work with the Czech government to educate Czech youth (not just the prostitutes) about the dangers of unprotected sex.  Although prostitution is legal in the Czech republic, the government bureaucracy was staffed with holdovers from the communist regime who refused to acknowledge that a problem existed with STD.  They refused to acknowledge that AIDS existed.

By the time my tour of duty ended things began to change. Sex education became part of the school curriculum, and sex works were taught how to avoid contracting STDs.  That doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist, but consider that this documentary was made more than 20 years.  From what i hear from  my colleagues who have recently return, things have improved dramatically.

Yes, the stories of the young men in this doc are heartbreaking.  I'd be interested to see a follow-up to the 1994 documentary, to see if our efforts to improve the the plight of the sex works have improved.

We had  urged the Czech government to license sex workers as the Dutch government does.  But due to the shear volume of dispossessed youth, it isn't a practical solution for an financially  stressed country.",1437523200,7,1263,4.957142857142857
1374875,4,B00004YKRO,Great insightful documentary.  Sadly most of these young men are probably not alive today.,1407196800,2,90,5.428571428571429

1374877,5,B00004YKRO,"This is more of a documentary than a movie.  However, I did not find sadness, as most reviews have given, o' how terrible, and tragic for these young men.  No, after all the young men portrayed in this documentary were all around the age of 17 to 21, or older. Not exactly children, rather young adults, don't belittle real sexual child abuse with this.  This is more of a way of life.  After all, all admitted to coming to Prague from through out Europe for three reasons: they all didn't like rule and regulation at home or they were being abused at home in some manner,  and for all they new they could make money.  I'm not giving ether or judgement on this way of life, but prostitution has existed since the beginning of and will continue.  Most of the charters in this documentary were not unhappy, and said they liked it, it was a way of life for them.  They can't imagine having a real job, where they would really have to work hard, from their mouths not mine, watch the film.  ""Where else can you make so must money in two hours"" some said.  Their biggest fear was old age and being alone.  Though I thought this film was well done. You will be informed.  Not a family move.",1398902400,,1184,4.3076923076923075
1374878,5,B00004YKRO,Such candid film making is a refreshing revelation and allows the viewer to see deep down into the layers of the onion that is life. This film evokes our sympathy as well as our disgust but the veracity of it leaves us informed.,1379894400,,228,4.325581395348837
1374879,2,B00004YKRO,I had been searching all over for this Doc. When I finally found it I bought it straight up only to be filled with Disappointment,1375488000,,129,4.2
1374880,5,B00004YKRO,"Here is the tragic realities portrayed, by the historic end of the communist bloc, as Eastern Europe nations, struggle to provide the same services and basic needs of a society as a republic or democracy.  The Czech Republic is no exception.  In the rural areas
of the Czech Republic, the end of the communist bloc meant no rule of law, no pensions, no employment, no health care, orphans left on the streets, et. al. So the young of all ages went to the cities like Prague in desperation to survive. From 11 or 12 years old into ages of 18 or the 20's, boys sold their sex to survive.  Until entry into the European Union, the common people strive to survive.  In the interim, those of Wealth, and promoters of the Pornography Industry prey on the desperation of the young.  This is an excellent documentary how Eastern European nations hope for the West to support their efforts for improved quality of life to end the debauchery.",1369094400,2,932,4.590361445783133
1374881,5,B00004YKRO,"For those of you who have never been to Prague or those who like to learn about eastern europe this is a good insight. i've been there several times and have witnessed first hand what this picture is about. it is a documentary that describes in detail the horrific and dreary lives of those less fortunate in post-communist czech republic. the things that young boys have to do to survive in the big city, having come from small villages outside Prague--this is not a documentary for children. This is a documentary for those who like to learn about all facets of life around the world. Picture quality is not as bad as previous reviews would lead you to believe.  I think if you buy it and don't like it you could donate it to a local university's socialogy department.",1003190400,17,770,4.539568345323741

1374923,4,B00004YKRO,"I thought it was an interesting story about the boys who come to Prague and end up in the sex trade or porn business.  You can tell it's made with the objective of making people feel sorry for these kids, but forgive me on this, they know why they are coming to Prague and what they will be doing when they get there.  I think everybody makes choices in their lives, and that's what these boys did.  To me, most of them seem pretty okay with where they are in life.  I mean it's not like it took much effort to get where they are, and I didn't hear many statements of regret.  So anyway, regardless of how you look at the issue, the documentary is interesting, so I think its worth watching.",1447113600,2,691,4.165413533834586

1374926,3,B00004YKRO,"Interesting but wildly disjointed overview of the Czech young male demi-monde. There is a good film in there if someone would apply some editing. Unlike many foreign documentaries, it is technically sound and works as a mood poem. Nothing really happens (which considering the subject may not be such a bad thing) but it is thoughtful and provocative.",1444867200,,351,5.068965517241379

1374928,5,B00004YKRO,this is a great movie it shows a young person who really loves older people the only one I really feel sorry for is the young girl that really loves him but loves him so much she wants to see him happy and that my dear people is what true love is all about,1439078400,,256,3.759259259259259
1374929,1,B00004YKRO,"I was not expecting it to be a documentary. I was expecting it to be more of a traditional movie that told a story, not a documentary.",1438819200,,134,4.0

7927278,3,B00004YKRO,"This documentary is a bit dated by 2016 standards, but tells an interesting story nonetheless of the exploitation that so frequently befalls countries that are undergoing drastic social, economic, and political changes.  The bulk of the young men featured are ""straight"" identified, but engage in ""gay for pay"" encounters with foreign travelers for the sake of survival in their newly (under) developed economy.  They are featured, at length, describing what led them down this path and the resultant consequences of their decisions.  While some express a desire to ""get out,"" many others seem at a loss to imagine what the future might hold for them.  It would be great to have some kind of follow-up on these young men to see if anything in their lives have shifted (for better or worse).  Liberating a country means little if what you put in place is worse than what was removed or discarded.  Something more politicians and world leaders would do well to remember when involving themselves in the affairs of those in other nations around the globe.",1468022400,2,1052,4.948863636363637

7927280,5,B00004YKRO,"The filmmaker has attracted prurient interest to revelation as cleverly and effectively as in any drama and with the tools he had handy: REAL LIVES.
  While dating to the socially and economically tumultuous time following the Iron Curtain's fall, the subjects of this documentary are instantly recognizable to anyone who's ever spent time in an urban setting: They are humans in need of a place.
  The title could not be more apt, as these mostly VERY young men are following a very adult course of survival  -but cannot know how innocent they still are.
  Even some of the youngest offer us wisdom in their interviews (after all, they have seen so much). The only thing more unblinking than the camera are its subjects, who give us almost any information-even if they have to look away from the camera.
  Less than half of these youth are gay- by admission anyway. All are at risk and know it: their future, health, day-to-day survival and even what's left of their innocence.
  Their charisma and brightness are as paradoxically evident as their acne. And this ensures we feel the tragedy of it -without the help of a single thespian!  We feel close to them. We want to give these boys a good meal; find them a meaningful occupation. We want the right to slap the cigs and drugs out of their hands!
  We do see a varied lot: including one well-turned-out, seasoned gay, who's attained a professional (if still risky) stability - and who one could see comfortably writing 'sex worker' on his tax forms.
  There is the smiling, matter-of-fact 'facilitator' in the TRAIN STATION who sees no moral dilemma [and perhaps that slightly goofy smile is an effective defense]. And most prominently shown (though others are as poignant) is the lad who grew up in the USA until his father dragged him back to the old country [a universal fear shared by all 'zero-generation' Americans, by the way--  including the Tsarnaev  brothers].
  He is compelling not just for his unmistakable American accent, which would startle any remaining detachment out of an American viewer -(and which no doubt attracts certain 'sexual tourists'); but for showing the universality (trans-Atlantic and timeless) of his dilemma. We can easily picture him falling into the same situation in New York.
  Except that it comes across even more bleakly in Praha: the director has him speaking in English to broaden the film's audience; but sadly, his vocabulary is fading away. How better to show a life headed in the wrong direction ?! He is loosing his 1st or 2nd language (shrinking his horizons) at a time of life when many Europeans are learning a 3rd or4th!
  Yes, you can find his situation in New York  today or in any city where you care to look [even Tehran].  Because, as this boy and the others show us, the universal problem is that we neglect our youth - even while some of us lust after them !
  Again, paradoxically (since love and lust can be hard to separate), it is our LOVE that the young need even as they pull away. Even if they are not ours; even if they seem 'deviant'.
  What is love?  It is attention. How did the director illicit such trust from his subjects? He was truly PAYING ATTENTION.
  Here and elsewhere economics can cause this dearth. But, seeing to our youth is always society's most important (and yes, most challenging) responsibility.
  I hasten to add that mostly what is portrayed here is NOT an alterative lifestyle.  And no, the attention paid here to our lads by the clientele is not what I had in mind above.
  When these young men talk of a 'John' who's been good to them -or even offered them some kind of life-  you can see in their eyes they know its a pipedream!
  This is an exploitative 'demi-monde' accessed by all manner of men (politicians are frequently mentioned), and some women; subjecting all manner of youth.  It has always been with us; but its dimensions (if well understood) can be minimized.

  The exploitation of boys always seems more shocking than that of the exponentially greater numbers of girls and women because of the widely shared masculine ego-myth. Hopefully, powerful work like this raises consciousness generally.
  But, I am preaching while our auteur only wanted to give us an honest portrait; which he has done - very well.
  As I said, I'd like to give all of these young men meaningful work; especially our 'facilitator ' -say in a local coal mine.

  Wiktor Grodecki's subsequent film, a few years later, on the same issue, in the same city, details an even darker situation [BODY WITHOUT SOUL,1996]. Only a prepared viewer should see it.",1459468800,,4592,4.740834386852086
