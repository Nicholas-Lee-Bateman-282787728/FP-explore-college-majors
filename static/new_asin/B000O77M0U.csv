2792644,5,B000O77M0U,A great series to have. If you have Gunbuster 1 you need to get this series to complete the saga. Gunbuster 2 has it own unique side and great storyline that complements the original.,1414800000,,183,4.411764705882353
2792645,5,B000O77M0U,"Spoiler free:

What I loved about this is the variable character interactions, with a lot of silliness.
If you like serious anime like Gundam Wing and not zany as FLCL or Gurren Lagann - you will probably dislike this.

As for variable character interactions, I expected the relationships between characters to stay the same, be static,
as is a common cliche in other anime.

Like one character is always mean from start to the end to the other character,
but this show doesn't do that despite it's short span. It develops and that's what makes it neat.
From hate and jealousy to being there to comfort the other character.

I suggest watching the first Gunbuster before going onto this one. It will make the impact much more enjoyable.
Note: The first Gunbuster is a lot older and has different anime art aesthetics, but just bite the bullet if you prefer the modern anime art style.

I saw this at a young age and I really loved it then. Pulled some heart strings. I've re-watched it recently after buying the collection, and it didn't stick as well, but I guess it's because I knew where it was all going. Still, I can recall the nostalgia seeing it first time after watching Gunbuster 1, and loving it.",1414281600,,1206,4.590697674418605
2792646,5,B000O77M0U,part 2 was even more amazing ! the whole redefinition of the main character its the best part of it troughout all the episodes!,1406073600,,127,4.333333333333333
2792647,4,B000O77M0U,"GunBuster 2/Aim for the Top 2: DieBuster is a worthwhile watch for fans of the original GunBuster series.

While not necessarily required to understand the plot, several key moments in DieBuster lose their emotional impact if one hasn't seen GunBuster.

On a technical level, the series is well-made.  Animation is great and the visuals are as epic as can be expected of Gainax (FLCL, Gurren Lagann). Some of the more interesting elements of the original series such as the effects of time dilation have been omitted, presumably to make the story more accessible and the story does have some pacing issues.  Specifically, the third episode seems rather pointless and focuses on fleshing out a secondary character who has no real impact on the events of the rest of the series.  However, the story is not incoherent in any way.

Overall, I say give it a watch.  It can be moderately enjoyed superficially if you haven't seen the original, but having watched GunBuster will bump it up a great deal.",1377734400,5,996,4.8579881656804735
2792648,4,B000O77M0U,"Gunbuster 2 is a good sequel to Gunbuster, with a new generation of pilots and a new threat. However, amazon's description is wrong. It is not in English. It is in Japanese with English subtitles. There is no English dub, so please do not buy this set expecting there to be one. Hopefully amazon corrects their information on their US and Canadian websites soon. I hate not being able to rely on them, but I've been stung too many times, so I always double-check now

[...]

It's also much cheaper from dvdpacific.com. I will pay the $16.48 US plus shipping from them, rather than over $30 from amazon.ca.",1366934400,6,605,4.592592592592593
2792649,5,B000O77M0U,"Welcome to ""Gunbuster 2' vol. 2 (OAV episodes 3 and 4) featuring the android Nono who wants to become a Gunbuster pilot, Lal'C (her onesama) and the Topless crew.

In episode 3 titled ""I Hate the Topless"", we get to learn more about the character Tycho. A Topless who is a member of the Mars Meganebula Base. In a way, Tycho is a reminiscent character of the original Gunbuster series of Jeung Freud, the Russian pilot who was rivals with Amano Kazumi.

In this case, the rivalry is between Tycho and Lal'C and Tycho is always competitive against her but yet always loses to her. In episode 3, her passion of being a rival leads to her Buster Machine ""Soixante-Six"" being destroyed by the space monsters.

But it's announced that a new Buster Machine has been made and is available (note: it was learned in the last volume that a Buster Machine has not been made in decades because of the high cost to produce them). And Nono has her eyes in finally getting a Buster Machine for herself, that is until, Tycho has her eyes set on the same Buster Machine.

The episode is primarily an episode focused on Tycho's character and why she has grown to be a person that is somewhat bitter and why she hates being a Topless.

You also get to meet more of the Topless pilots but most of all, how some of them despise Nono because she is an android. A lot of them feel she's an idiot.

But you also get to know more about the Serpentine Twins, two mysterious twins who dream of becoming eternal Topless. They are working on a secret excavation project which they hope will bring them closer to their dream.

In episode 4 titled ""Resurrection!! The Legendary Buster Machine!"", ""Gunbuster 2' is taken to overdrive and packed with action as the Serpentine Twins excavation to resurrect the ""Sirius Buster Machine"" is underway and their dream of becoming eternal Topless may be coming true. That is until what is discovered becomes a shocker and leads to a tragic battle which includes all Gunbuster Machines.

In this awesome episode, we get to see a major development with Nono as her dream to become a Buster pilot may come true.

I really don't want to reveal so much but after watching this volume, I was wanting more! It was great to see somewhat of a homage to the Jeung/Kazumi rival of the original series in episode 3 of ""Gunbuster 2' between Tycho and Lal'C but most of all, to see how action-packed and tragic things get with episode 4. I was amazed by the animation, the battles and impressed with the overall storyline.

So, not wanting to spoil it for anyone, all I can say is that ""Gunbuster Vol. 2' is just awesome.

Animation and sound is top notch as the previous volume. Again, there is no English dubbing but the overall voice talent in this series is done very well. Audio is presented in Digital 5.1 and 2.0. The Digital 5.1 really sounded quite cool on my surround sound as it's used quite a bit, especially in episode 4.

As for the animation, animation is done very well in this volume and is presented in 16:9LB.

As for special features, again we are blessed with a 23 minute ""DIEBUSTER TV"" episode with an interview with screeplay writer Enokido Yoji.

Again, similar to the last volume, I was very hypnotized by this latest episode of ""DIEBUSTER TV"" as we got to learn more about the creation of ""Gunbuster 2' and what went on the mind of Enokido when writing the screen play. Again, another special feature that enhances your overall feeling of the anime series. So, very grateful this was included in this second volume.

Also, included in this volume, like the previous is the 20-page DVD insert booklet which features cast information on Tycho and the Topless pilots and their Buster Machines.

Also, somewhat of a science lesson is the inclusion of ""Brainless World's Basic Knowledge"" which is a primer to various technical things featured in OAV episodes 3 and 4 such as what a ""Red Milky Way"", ""Expiration"" of a Topless, ""Exotic Maneuver"", ""Clefshin Luminescence"" and other scientfic terms are all about. There are about four pages filled with terminology which will make the science buffs grin.

Also included is the ""Buster Machine Development History"". This one I found very intriguing because there is not much record on Buster Machines previous to #10 (Dix-Neuf) which is piloted by Lal'C.

But overall, a very good information source on Buster Machines from #10 all the way up to 90's which include the new Buster Machine unveiled in episode 3.

Also, similar to the last DVD insert booklet is the inclusion of more science lessons and interviews with Tycho voice actress Sawashiro Miyuki and voice actor for Nicola, Iwata Mitsuo.

I know that there are people who may have only seen the first episode or two of ""Gunbuster 2' but all I can say is watch it from beginning to the end, you won't be disappointed. If you are a fan of the original ""Gunbuster"", I can't say how important it is to watch ""Gunbuster 2' and see how it ties into the original.

As for the DVD, I found the beauty of ""Gunbuster 2' through the DVD series. From the ""DIEBUSTER TV"" featurette and the 20-page booklet, you gain such an appreciation of what director Tsurumaki and screenplay writer Enokido were planning for the overall series and made me love it even more.

That is one thing that I love about the release of DVD's of how a featurette (or director's commentary) can really be the ultimate eye opener of a series and literally boost your appreciation for it. The inclusion of ""DIEBUSTER TV"" and the 20-page booklet was a great addition and I'm very thankful for Bandai Visual to include that.

All in all, a beautiful anime and things just continue to get better with this second volume and the fourth episode alone really changes the dynamics of the series. Wow!

This volume was great but what Gainax has planned for the final two episodes will definitely bring things to full circle for fans of the original ""Gunbuster"" series and this new series but for this volume alone, I'm still saying... ""Wow!""

8183930,4,B000O77M0U,"A continuation nearly 10,000 years (I think) since the end of last major battle in the first Gunbuster.  Those heroines haven't arrived back on earth yet.  A nice series that was worth picking up.",1509321600,,196,4.735294117647059

The packaging was excellent and the condition of the DVD's are new. It also comes sealed in a plastic wrap. This show is gives off good vibes and feels. I totally recommend buying this!",1490659200,,337,4.728813559322034
8183932,3,B000O77M0U,"Far too rushed for an attempt at epic. Good animation, good Japanese voice acting - the only DVD set I've gotten that only seems to have Japanese language bu default. But way too short. The characters don't feel truly developed, especially when they drop lines like, wanting to be with everyone and such. This aside, it looks like they focused in on their message as much as possible within these few episodes, but because of everything else crammed in, it lacked punch. Could have easily been a single disk.",1481328000,,508,4.719101123595506

8183937,5,B000O77M0U,"The series is great! Kept me riveted to the screen for the entire thing! So great that it's a short and sweet show, so there aren't a lot of boring fillers, just constant plot plot plot. It lacks a little in character introductions and growth, but it does a good job of making sure we know who the main/important characters are and makes sure we care about them. Not safe for you children since there are at least two(that I can think of) totally topless scenes(that is both true and a pun! Watch the show to get what I mean!) I almost wish it was dubbed in English just so I didn't have to read while watching the show, but I love the talent of the Japanese voice actors so much more than any English dub could do. Highly recommend as long as you don't mind having to read english subtitles the whole time.",1438732800,,807,4.246753246753247
