She knows her subject and gives lots of examples to get the concepts across. While the usual emphasis of the Enneagram is how there are nine different ways we can be dysfunctional, Brady covers this and then turns to the positive aspects of each Personality Type and shows how each type has a spiritual gift. This program was made in 1993 and originally presented on VHS, but now has been transferred to DVD. Her book ""Beginning Your Enneagram Journey"" 1994 goes very well with this video series.",1290124800,5,665,4.55
8264294,5,B0017093MI,"I am categorically pleased with the Enneagram DVDs. Ms. Brady is a charming and gifted presenter. This set is everything I hoped that it would be. When we know ourselves we know how to improve ourselves, and when we know ourselves we can understand others better. Read books for the deepest details and enjoy these DVDs to see these ideas come alive. In addition to the three discs, after placing the first disc in your computer you can view or print out a well designed 29 page Notes for Viewers Manual which can be used as a study guide to use alone or to teach this material. Further, the sound is superb. I am somewhat hard of hearing yet understood every word. After an introduction melody the only sound is the clear voice of Ms. Brady.",1210809600,14,742,4.463235294117647
