The whole film was tiring. Only good thing was that it was short, 1.5hrs. Personally, I felt it was a failed attempt at making a Turkish art-house type film.",1360108800,,321,4.440677966101695
8355047,5,B0027PGC2G,"A provincial family living on Turkey's southern Mediterranean coast finds their leisurely pace of life suddenly interrupted when the father suffers a sudden brain hemorrhage while away from home on a business trip. Ten year old Ali (Tayfun Gunay) lives with his family in the town of Silifke. He's constantly picked on at school, and as the summer vacation begins he's upset that he hasn't received one of the homework books that's been issued to the rest of his classmates. Meanwhile, Ali's older brother Veysel (Harun Ozuag) returns from the military academy to reveal that he's dropping out to study business management at the local university. His father Mustafa (Osman Inan), a stern agricultural merchant, makes no attempt to mask his disapproval of the plan, and informs Veysel that should he choose to walk that path he will be on his own monetarily. Mustafa's wife Guler (Ayten Tokun) is the emotional anchor of the family, and suspects that her husband has recently taken a mistress. All of these minor problems are eclipsed, however, when Mustafa suffers a debilitating brain hemorrhage while traveling for his job. Though it won't be easy readjusting to life after such a tragedy, this family is determined to make do and carry on no matter what hardships life throws their way.

In this sense the film is told according the welll known parameters of a good script. The peaceful introduction in which we assist to the eve of the next summer; then, we will witness the in and outs of all that though life'e experience this boy will have to face and so,when he returns to class he will have to do a brief essay that resumes all what he did on these two last months. This poignant film was for me a majusucle surprise when I watched it the last Saturday evening. The original script, the sumptuous photography and the fluidness of the narration, supported by arresting landscapes make this movie one of my twenty films of this year.

So, no doubt it and go for for it. It will reward you from start to finish. A genuine masterpiece.",1301875200,,2041,4.762711864406779
