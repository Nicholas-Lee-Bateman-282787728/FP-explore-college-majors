8466008,4,B005CXIQME,"Director Luis Mandoki follows the preparations leading up to the celebration of El Da de los Muertos in the small town of San Jos Independencia of Oaxaca, Mexico. The town was displaced, and relocated during the construction of the presa Miguel Alemn (1949-1955). The project, carried out by the Mexican Republic, aimed to generate electricity from hydraulic energy. The documentary captures a village caught in-between the modernizing push of the Mexican state and the village's deep-rooted sense of tradition and culture.

 The film, originally released in 1981, was recently restored, archived, and rereleased as part of a larger film series on indigenous film. Cine Indigenista aims to illustrate ways of life, traditions, understandings of identity, land, beliefs, ideas, cultural expressions, and educational values as they are captured through film. The organization focuses its work on subjects that demonstrate the diverse problems encountered by the majority of indigenous peoples across Mexico.",1319414400,,1005,5.693333333333333
