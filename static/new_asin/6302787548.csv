7831139,2,6302787548,"This is best described as a Poor Man's El Cid.and is an obvious attempt to cash in on the huge success of the 1961 Heston/Loren/Anthony Mann film.
It benefits from being shot in Spain, and it's not a grade B movie budget wise...they spent a fair amount of  money on the film and the battle scenes are well done...but other then that the film pretty much sucks.
The script is basically bad, and the cast is totally forgettable...except for Frankie Avalon as a medieval minstrel..and I am not kidding. You will want to forget Avalon looking hopelessly out of place in a Medieval epic, but you will not be able to. He was out of place in 1836 in ""The Alamo"" and it is ten times worse here.
The Plot (designed to be as much like El Cid as possible) is Christian vs Moor, with lots of big battles but none of the style or panache of El Cid.
Brodrick Crawford. and Cesar Romero are the other two obligatory American ""Big Names"" in the film (though both were very much past their prime as stars; quite a few European productions would cast Ameircan stars on the downgrade in their films because they did not cost much and suppodedely added box office appeal for American Audiences) and though not well cast are at least not total embarassments like Avalon is.
All in all, a classic example of an inferior film trying to cash in on a successful film.
The Battle scenes and good production values lift it up to  two stars, but overall it's a pale imitation of ""El Cid"".""El Cid"" is one of the best epic films ever made, this is a pale imitation.
I have to wonder about the people giving it 5 stars reviews. given it ijust plain not very good. Crap like that is why Amazon User Reviews have such a poor reputation.",1493337600,,1703,4.386075949367089
7831140,2,6302787548,"It might be an old classic but it was terrible.  The acting was terrible, except for Cesar Romero, and the sets were not great, either.  The script was silly.  I don't recommend it.  It isn't old enough to be that bad.",1475798400,,218,4.2439024390243905

7831144,3,6302787548,"OK ""historical"" Spanish-made, English-dubbed flick about El Cid routing the Moors in Spain.  A lot of wrangling about the various kingdoms in Spain not working together very well to fight off the occupying invaders.  Also a pair of saints come down from Heaven to help the fumbling humans do things right.  The stars are a mulligan stew group from all over; Euros, Latinos, Americanos.  The worst part is Frankie Avalon as a traveling minstrel keeping the audience updated on the proceedings.  All that is OK but it takes so looooong to tell its story.  Over two hours.  The Warner Archive DVD-R release is fine quality and is the one to get.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1417996800,,679,4.743589743589744

7831146,4,6302787548,"This is a fun, lesser known show about the Reconquista (not for the strict History minded). Made after El Cid and on a much more limited budget apparently, it makes up for it with the filming on the historical sites. It does somewhat remind me of an Iberian release of Krazcy, or Alexander Nevsky (propaganda works against the Germans, but here against the Moors).

An enjoyable two hours, despite a sound track that was propbably the worst part of the movie.",1350000000,,459,4.666666666666667
7831147,4,6302787548,"I see this movies go to many many many years. This is a amusing epic with Espartaco Santoni in the leader character. The count Fernan Gonzalez (another Cid ""caballero"") and your battlers versus the invasors Arabians. The ending battle is one Spanish Legend. Santiago (Saint James) voyaged from heaven to Spain for combat this enemy.
Broderick Crawford is a bad king and death coming soon. Frankie Avalon sing in Spanish with American accent. Is a kind serie B not great but amusing very much.",1243728000,2,492,4.869047619047619
7831148,2,6302787548,"This spanish-made ""spectacle"" was released a year after ""El Cid"" and takes a different look at the medieval Spanish wars between  the Moors and the Christians. Whereas the Charlton Heston epic carried a  message of unity for loyal Spaniards, whether Moorish or Christian, this  movie is a flat out jingoistic anti-Moorish propaganda film. Both movies  had large casts, huge battle scenes, a struggle of a hero to unite Spain, a  romance, and are told in a style evoking tales told by medieval troubadors.  ""El Cid,"" however, has garnered both critical and popular  accolades and is actually a damn fine movie, though its stylistic  earnestness gets an occasional campy snicker. ""The Castilian""'s  stylistic earnestness fails to impress and the production values show a  depressing cheapness for what was supposed to be such a big movie.
Frankie Avalon (!) plays a travelling minstrel who tels the tale of a  hero who defeats the Moors in an epic battle with the assistance of two  saints with flaming swords. His scenes of exposition are just silly to the  point of embarassment. There is lots of Spanish mountains and countryside,  lots of bad dubbed dialogue, lots of pro-Christian, anti-Muslim stuff, some  swordfighting, and a surprisingly lugubrious battle. It is said that the  battle was the largest ever filmed or something like that, and there is an  impressive shot of the Christian army marching in a cross formation, but  somehow it lacks the excitement of battle scenes in ""Spartacus""  or ""El Cid."" The aide that is given by the saints seems to  undercut the achievements of the people involved.
I am a completist when  it comes to medieval movies, yet after seeing this once, I really did not  have a desire to see it again.",964828800,15,1738,4.9411764705882355
