The Brainy Baby one is longer, 45 minutes compared to 30 minutes for bilingual baby. The content is structured differently. As an infant and toddler my daughter liked bilingual baby, but now she prefers the Brainy Baby version. There is a more extended vocabulary and there is some review of the familiar basic words from the first video. There is some footage in both, but they are certainly different!",1053388800,5,532,4.670212765957447
182514,3,1560154012,"If you already own Small Fry's Spanish tape (vol 2)  - you'll find that Baby Brainy Spanish uses the exact same footage, in fact it's the same tape - it is just edited differently.  My 2 1/2 yr old son prefers the Brainy Baby version  - probably because it starts out simpler -  with nouns, progresses to colors, numbers, verbs and then phrases.  The Small Fry Bilingual Baby tape hurries into phrases too quickly, it's not as well done. (And no, I wouldn't consider it a part 2 of the series) I am disappointed that I own 2 copies of this tape, unfortunately Small Fry is unwilling to do anything about it.
  On the other hand - we really like Baby Brainy Left and Right - those are wonderful. If Brainy Baby were to take those and translate them into Spanish and any other language - that would be a great teaching tool.  Since around age 2 - my son has spoken/known his alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes and now speaks in complete but simple sentences.",1051660800,7,955,4.417142857142857
182515,5,1560154012,"I am a billingual Spanish (Cuban)/English speaker. It is very important to me that I teach my son Spanish.  I bought this video to reinforce my teachings.  I am very pleased with all that it covers.  It reviews the numbers 1-10, colors, common nouns, some parts of the body, Mommy, Daddy, common verbs, hello, goodbye, yes, no, and how to say please and I love you.  It does some reviews with questions and answers for things like, ""How many books are there?  There is one book."", or ""What color is the snowman? The snowman is white."" (obviously in Spanish).  The words for all of these are displayed in Spanish on the screen in large print and in English in small print.  There is a lot of repetion to reinforce the lessons.  They missed some obvious things, like how to say thanks you and some parts of the body (like arms), but I guess you can't get everything in. They also use a couple of words that are different from my dialect, but there are so many dialects, I can't see how they can avoid it.  They also sing Mary had a Little Lamb in Spanish (no words are shown onscreen while doing this, which would have been nice).

182516,4,1560154012,"Brainy Baby is a high quality video for children to learn some Spanish words and phrases, however, it varies very little from Bilingual Baby (Spanish) with it's pictures, words, and music.  I was disappointed to spend $ with shipping to receive a video so similar to one I already own and love. It has perhaps 15 words different than Bilingual Baby.  If you don't have Bilingual Baby, Brainy Baby is wonderful.  If you're looking for the best, I would reccommend Bilingual Baby for it's slightly slower speech patterns and the helpful translated script found on the fold out jacket cover.  Both are produced and sold by Small Fry, yet there is no indication on the Brainy Baby video information that it is almost the same video as Bilingual Baby.

My daughter started watching these as a baby [I left them playing in the background so she would be used to hearing Spanish] and they still entertain her as a three year old.  The songs are extremely catchy, sung in Spanish and English with both the Spanish and English words at the bottom of the screen.  My daughter really liked the bright colors and the kids engaging in all their activities that go along with the songs.  She learned the songs and went around singing them, and I feel that this has given her a firm foundation for later learning to be fluent in Spanish.
As a side note, my husband started learning Spanish as well, just from hearing the tape over and over!  Now he even speaks some rudimentary Spanish without even really trying to learn it.

There is a River, Let's go on a picnic, Let's  take a walk in the Forest, When the Circus Comes to Town,  I live in the  city (clap your hands to the rhythm of the city), the opposites song,  etc.
I have successfully used the series in teaching children German.  The children are attentive and enjoy the tapes, which make excellent  introductions to concepts.
Now, I have been assigned to a school where  20% of the incoming students do not speak English--so I am learning Spanish  from these beautiful tapes.  The songs are so wonderful that I can listen  to them for hours while I do other tasks.  And after only two days of  (intensive) listening, I am beginning to sing them in my head even when I  am not listening to the tapes.
The quality of the photography is  excellent.  The themes are child oriented and interesting. They hold the  audience's attention.

I REALLY LIKED that it didn't flip back and forth between English/Spanish; it's much more effective to help children understand the context and meaning of Spanish without always giving a translation.  Constantly encouraging translation just adds an extra step in the acquisition.  Example - after multiple sloooow slides of apples, I guess they should get ""manazana"" right!? ;) Yet - it works!!
At any rate, my kids will choose this DVD over others on my shelf of Spanish DVDs.  Bottom line, there probably are better out there, but this isn't a waste of money either; it's slow, easy and good for beginners.  I like to start/stop and give my kids a chance to use the vocab, etc.  It works.

182541,5,1560154012,"First a little background. I'm a cuban-american. Born in the US...parents from Cuba. I learned Spanish as my primary language but, as I grew up, English took over. Now when I speak spanish, I sound gringo as hell...but I can hold my own. I may sound (and screw up) but I can carry conversation...even with the picky Spaniards.

I married a Trini that speaks barebones school-taught spanish. Luckily she's very supportive of spanish as a 2nd language so I speak to my son in pure spanish all day...everyone else (her and 2 brothers) speaks to him in pure english all night.

I never give in. I always keep up the spanish. The results...he's learning. He knows what I'm saying and, although he may talk back in english at times, he understands. So if you know a bit of spanish...don't stop...they're listening and picking it up.

Now..onto the DVD. I'm reading these reviews about ""proper spanish"" and this crap makes me sick. Listen...just get the friggin' DVD. Who cares if he says ""creyones"" (I grew up on this word and it's perfectly fine). Who cares about the 2 or 3 odd words that don't get spoken in Spain. Let's get real...they're in the minority of latin america. I'm talking *minority*. Bottom line...I just want my kid to learn. If he says ""bola"" so what? Also, the speaker *is* spanish.

Onto the story...My son is now 2.5 years old. He's been going to sleep with this video since he was 18 months. The soothing music and voice is perfect for nighttime. Plus, I want him to hear the spanish dialect as well.

The results:
My son knows every friggin' word in the video. He can count from 1-10. He knows how to say every, single word. Seriously. And for those of you thinking ""it only works when he's watching the DVD""....guess what? I walk with him to the mailbox and he counts the numbers on the boxes...in Spanish! He even knows words I don't speak in the daytime. I didn't understand where he got them, until I saw them in the video near the end.

Bottom line...this video is perfect for introducing and teaching Spanish. As adults we may find it boring...but for my Noggin spoiled kiddo...he digs it.

A huge 5 stars from my end.",1241395200,8,2142,4.5625

The truth is that at the moment, there were not many other options out there, specially full-immersion DVDs or CDs.

Luckily for my second child, there are much better options available now, specially foreign productions. I am specially excited about a collection of DVDs by A LA VIBORA DE LA MAR that I discovered on a trip to Mxico. I have been using them with my 2-year old for almost a year, and she absolutely loves them  (these are full immersion DVDs, in fact, they were designed for Spanish-speaking babies... but they have worked wonders for my children who have developed an acute ear for the language)...

My biggest complaint, though, is that the music is far too loud. It almost drowns the woman's voice in some spots. It's very distracting!

182563,5,1560154012,"This is my first Amazon review--the product is just so great I had share.

My daughter has been watching this video since she was 6 mos old--she's almost three now and is just starting to outgrow it.  I would put it on and she would sit totally mesmerized for the entire length.  Later she started repeating out loud after the narrator.  The original VHS was a bit shorter than the DVD (I bought it twice if that tells you anything!), and the shorter version was actually better for her attention span.

She knows all the words, colors, and can count.  As a first generation American (of South American parents), it has been my goal to ""not lose the language"" and to give my child the same gift of a second language that my parents gave me. This video has been an invaluable tool in working toward that goal. This is the only video I have found that is purely in spanish, and I personally think that immersion is the best method of teaching another language (especially to small children just forming any language skills at all).  I have the Lyric Language video which does half english and half spanish which is okay but goes too long for a small kid's attention span, and Sesame Street's Fiesta which is fun to watch but only has about eight words (plus the numbers) in Spanish.

I'm patiently waiting for the next level (hopefully soon)--I'm definitely buying it when it comes out!",1130716800,7,1384,4.55241935483871

It is a basic starting point, but it is was a thrill to hear my baby (2.5 yrs) repeat all the words in spanish.

With other videos such as baby einstein or blues clues he pays attention to what is going on, talks to the television, and so on.  This video wasn't able to hold his attention for 2 minutes.  The video has a lot of potential.  I liked the way they did the counting and how they have only speak in spanish but the english words are in the corner for the parents.  The best part of the DVD was the music video for Mary Had a Little Lamb; but they only had that one song.  Maybe if they had incorporated more of this technique the video would have been more interesting.",1120608000,6,629,4.1570247933884295

The Spanish is good, it uses some words that we don't use frequently for some objects (like ""bola"" for ball) but I can live with that.  There is only one word that I think the translation is wrong: ""Creyones"" I never heard that.  We use Crayones o Crayolas but not ""Creyones""

Also, the best way to teach kids spanish is to immerse them in the music, visuals and language and this video doesn't do that.  In fact none of the United States based videos do.  I highly recommend you try videos that come from Hispanic countries instead.  Much more visually impactful.  Try ""Los Rayos"".",1105833600,26,430,4.379746835443038

I suggest you try ""Rayitos Del Saber - Las Formas"", they only have this one video so far but it is very lively, it has great puppets segments and the music is great.  It'll keep your child entertained while it teaches him/her Spanish.",1100649600,10,494,4.406593406593407
182570,2,1560154012,"First, I should say that I am originally from Spain, and my wife is from Central America. Our native language is Spanish, which we are proud to cultivate. Now, let's get on with the review.

We bought this DVD for my 20 month year old hoping to expose him to some Spanish via the TV. Both my wife and I speak to him in Spanish.

First, I would like to address the content of the DVD.

As a previous reviewer said, the DVD uses a NON-native speaker. The first lesson starts by showing a plastic soccer ball. The proper word in Spanish word for a ball is ""pelota"". ""Bola"" is generally used for hard balls, like a bowling or a billiard's ball. Next, the video shows a box of crayolas. The announcer goes on to say ""Crayones"". What!!?? Sorry, but that is not a real word. I guess ""pinturas"", ""lapices de colores"", ""colores"", ""ceras"" was too hard to come up with? Next, orange is translated as ""anaranjado"". The proper translation is ""naranja"". ""Anaranjado"" means ""like orange"". I could go on an on...

Let's now atalk about the format of the DVD.

Sorry, but it is not entertaining enough for a kid. It basically bombards him/her with words & images. There are no sketches or stories of any kind. It is very likely that your kid will soon turn away from the set and go on to more interesting things. I suggest you play one chapter at a time to avoid overloading the kid. My oldest son is now 22 moths old and this DVD is too basic for him. I hope that gives you an indication of the level of the content.

To conclude, I would like to point out that this DVD was probably done with very little money and it shows. For the money, this DVD should have better content, better presentation, and include a color picture book.

Unfortunately for those of you that are looking for a decent Spanish DVD to teach your kids, there isn't much out there. This is the winner by default, and hence my 2 star rating.",1097798400,67,1897,4.34180790960452
182571,5,1560154012,"I have taken many years of Spanish...had a million teachers with differing backgrounds and dialects.(i.e. Castillian, S.American, Mexican).. I loved this video! I thought it was very thorough...almost like a first year Spanish class.

  I agree that there are a few words that are not too commonly used..but, there are different dialects throughout the world, and the words the video teaches.. gets the idea across..no matter which Spanish speaking nation is listening.

 I think..as a VERY busy..somewhat bi-lingual mother of 2..that the video is an excellent way to teach your kiddos spanish words and phrases.

  Another thing I liked about the video was that it is very much like a classroom exercise..it taught, gave examples, asked questions..sang a song using words learned..then it reviewed everything taught.

 The video is definately for older toddlers...my 3 yr. old will watch it (on occasion)..my 17 mo old will watch it...(sort of)..yet, she has no clue what is going on and doesn't really care. But..my husband watched it and learned beginning Spanish..:)

 I really think..if you have a school age kid..get it..a child over 31/2.. get it..a younger child..get it...and play it while they are doing something else...you may learn something too!",1092787200,6,1259,5.303030303030303
182572,2,1560154012,"Unless you're tone deaf, you'll want to avoid this one. The string quartet that plays on the soundtrack is so out of tune that I could not even tolerate one complete playing of the video. Aside from that I guess it's fine, thus the 2 stars. We also bought Brainy Baby - Right Brain, which is much better. I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. Our favorite learning video thus far is Baby Van Gogh by baby einstein.

182573,5,1560154012,"Was very impressed with the video. I have an 18 month old who loves it. The only negative is that the Spanish is more Castilian.

If you're interested in this raising a bilingual child, ""Babies Speaking Spanish"" is an excellent video. My 18 month old sits through the entire video!",1077926400,,380,4.686567164179104
182574,4,1560154012,"When I saw one of the very negative reviews, I thought this person was exaggerating given that I had bought the Brainy Baby for French DVD and thought it was really good (quality and all), but I needed to buy an educational DVD for my 18 mo. old daughter in Spanish since is too my very first mother tongue. I decided to buy this DVD, specially because there are not many out there of this kind. When I saw it, I thought it wasn't that bad. It does have accents where there should be, and question marks (Did this person referred to an old version?) However, they did use a couple of words that I would not use in spanish so it's useless to teach a toddler words she would not use, like the word for ball (pelota), they used ""bola"". I think pelota is more widely used, not just in Mexico. That is my only criticism; they should have used a term that is common for many countries, so I think they should have done a little more research and the narrator would be fine. Her pronunciation is fenomenal (regardless whether or not she is a native speaker, it doesn't matter!). The content of the video is great, just what a toddler needs to learn a language in a fun way. My daughter enjoyed this DVD from beginning to end. It's just good enough to entertain my daughter without mindless TV cartoons.",1075852800,144,1295,4.333333333333333

Now that she has just turned one, there are many words that she says and recognizes from the video.  As a Spanish speaker myself, I highly recommend it, although there are some words that could use different translations (but that depends where you are from.)
