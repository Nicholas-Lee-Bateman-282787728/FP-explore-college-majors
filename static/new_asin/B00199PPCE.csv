3430513,5,B00199PPCE,Enjoyed watching real actors at work.  The pace of the storytelling allows for the development of the characters and the plot.  There is nothing like a Brit mystery!,1220140800,6,165,4.857142857142857
3430514,4,B00199PPCE,"Unlike many other works of P D James,this one is slow moving,probably because
Dalgliesh is not in charge of the investigation. It is also somewhat unrealistic
(even for fiction),as 7 women have been murdered at night,and women are still
going outside alone after the sun sets. The discovery of the main murderer seems
to have occured with little police input (it's a wonder the local ""cop"" was
not superceeded by an outsider).The technical production is good,except I do
miss not having Closed Captioning (British sound/pronunciation takes some
careful listening at times. Also,a spell out of the character names would have
been helpful). All this said,this DVD set is worth viewing and my remarks should
be considered along with more positive ones,such as those of ""Mr Jim"".",1219017600,13,775,5.158730158730159
3430515,5,B00199PPCE,"Koch Vision presents ""DEVICES AND DESIRES"" (4 January 1991) (310 mins/Color) -- the 1989 detective novel in the Adam Dalgliesh (Roy Marsden) series by P. D. James --- It takes place on Larksoken, an isolated headland in Norfolk --- Commander Adam Dalgliesh, having published his second volume of poetry, retreats to the remote Larksoken headland where his recently deceased aunt, Jane Dalgliesh, left him a converted windmill --- However, a psychopathic mass murderer, known as the Norfolk Whistler, is on the loose and seems to have arrived at Larksoken when Dalgliesh finds the body of the nearby nuclear power plant's Acting Administrative Officer during an evening stroll on the beach --- We then watch the effect a following series of interlocking plots have on each other --- Certainly one of the outstanding examples of P.D. James mystery writing.

Under the production staff of:
John Davies - Director
Thomas Ellice - Screenwriter
P.D. James - Novel
Carol Gould - Asst Producer
John Rosenberg - Producer
Richard Harvey - Original Score
Geoff Greenleaf - Cinematographer
Keith Judge - Film Editor

The story line deals at length with such issues as nuclear power and its dangers/benefits; the loss of a wife and the effect it has on a family; the bond of siblings; the use and manifestations of both psychosis and duty; and, finally, the love among family members --- The film is also notable in that Dalgliesh himself does not actually solve the crime; the plot instead begins with different characters carrying on their lives with the bleak backdrop of a controversial power station and a prowling serial killer --- Soon, however, after the copycat murder that propels the story along, we start to watch the characters bounce and chaff and strike out at one another, but very little actual detecting takes place --- Still, the plots merit is in its ability to entwine multiple human beings who must try to live their lives amidst chaotic circumstances --- It should also be noted that the mystery actually has nothing at all do with the serial killer --- Everything about this production is excellent. What a cast! Full of fascinating twists, turns and bizarre subplots - not to mention a series of very creepy murders, this one is a certainly a winner in my book.

the cast includes:
Roy Marsden ...  Commander Adam Dalgliesh
 Susannah York ...  Meg Dennison
 Gemma Jones ...  Alice Mair
 James Faulkner ...  Dr Alex Mair
 Tony Haygarth ...  Chief Inspector Terry Rickards
 Tom Georgeson ...  Ryan Blaney

Roy Marsden is a terrific Dalgleish (unfortunately he never liked the character and quit the series before it ran it's course) and the supporting cast is equally as good.

3430526,4,B00199PPCE,"""I tend to believe in an absolute morality, independent of time or circumstance.""--Adam Dalgleish

Anyone who is a PD James fan is a fan of Adam Dangleish. He is the superlative in Inspectors. I have read the entire series,and I am a fan of the DVD series. This series is thirty years old and looks it in several ways, but I like to revisit that time when everything seems to be black and white,no grey to muddy the waters.

London Inspector Adam Dalgleish, played by Roy Marsden, Is on leave, trying to settle his aunt's estate. An old friend, Meg, played by Susannah York, catches him up on all the local gossip. There is a hint of a romance here, however,  action is slow for Dangleish. Meanwhile, there's a serial killer known as The Whistler roaming the countryside. The local policeman has met with Dangleish asking his advice. The murders hit home for Dalgleish at a dinner party; one of the guests is late because he stumbled on a body. Naturally, he tells more of what he saw to the assembled guests than is wise, and, then, Dalgleish finds the body of a woman from the nearby nuclear plant after she is killed by an unknown assailant. It looks like The Whistler has struck again.

There are several older actors I recognize from many BBC films, Gemma Jones, late  of MI-5, James Faulkner, Nicola Cowper, Susan Crowley, and a very young Kate Beckinsall.  The action may be slow but it is steady and is superb for me.

3430527,4,B00199PPCE,"OK loved both of the books, the movies are well done it a trifle long love the scenery and the actors but it felt as if both movies were running on molasses.",1358553600,2,157,3.9375
3430528,5,B00199PPCE,I love p d James videos - they keep you guessing who done it Roy Marsden is wonderful - low key but insightful,1356652800,,110,3.8260869565217392
3430529,2,B00199PPCE,"First off, pay no attention to the `editorial reviews' section.  The women of London are not being terrorized by the Whistler.  The Whistler, like Dalgleish, is in Norfolk.  Dalgleish has inherited the windmill/cottage of his recently-deceased aunt and he is vacationing there when suspicions and fears concerning the Whistler's murders dominate the local scene.  In some ways, this is awkward for the plot, for Dalgleish investigates the murders, informally, but he is not in charge of the investigation; a former colleague/subordinate is.

This part of Norfolk (despite the beautiful Norman churches which dot the countryside) is a nasty bit of business.  Just for starters, Dalgleish must deal with: a brother and sister team who may have killed their father, an alcoholic widower with a brood of kids, one of whom goes to a local ruin at night to pray, some local retro-hippies protesting the nearby nuclear power plant, some very real terrorists who have hacked into the power plant's computer system and might bring the China syndrome to Norfolk; a smarmy personal assistant to the plant director who appears to have a checkered past, a plant worker who suicides by leaping to his death on the cap covering the core at the plant, and, lest we forget--the Whistler himself (herself?), who goes about strangling women and putting body hair in their mouths.

Bottom line: a few too many characters and a bit too much mystification in the plot.  The redeeming elements: performances by Susannah York and the always excellent Gemma Jones.  Marsden mumbles as Dalgleish; although he is the iconic player of this part, because of longevity, Martin Shaw is far more effective in the role.  Those who have not seen him as Dalgleish should prepare themselves for a rare treat.

The major problem with the production is the sound.  There are no subtitles; there is a great deal of mumbling and the sound is simply done incompetently.  When characters continue talking but turn their heads away from the camera or go to the door, etc. we are suddenly unable to hear them properly.  In a 5-hour+, very talky story this is a significant problem.  At points there are whole sentences and paragraphs which are inaudible.  Assuming a sound level of 1-10 on your TV remote, where you usually listen to programming at ""4"", you need to crank up  your set to ""8"" or ""9"" just to hear the characters.  Then, however, you are confronted with the intrusive background music or, in some cases, background noise.  Here we have a major production with serious actors and a serious script, but the finished film sounds like something done by a beginning film student in his garage.

If you are able to (more or less) hear it, the story will hold your attention.  This is for one of those long nights or weekends when you lack a good book to read and can count on the fact that if it's P. D. James it won't be all that bad.",1339632000,2,2899,4.792756539235413
3430530,4,B00199PPCE,"This series takes Dalgliesh to the Norfolk area where his recently deceased Aunt Jane has left him her home which is a converted windmill. As one would expect, murder and mayhem precede him and compels him to use his considerable skills to help the local police unravel the mystery.

This particular series is not for general viewing by the entire family as there are several scenes with partial frontal nudity and rather graphic scenes of murdered corpses; I cannot recommend this one for children. From the perspective of British detective shows this one is good and holds ones interest through all six episodes.

As is usual liberties are taken with P. D. James' story line but all in all the series works pretty well. There are some lovely beach scenes that help establish a mood of isolation.

If you're a Dalgliesh fan you'll probably enjoy this one too.",1312934400,7,860,4.797297297297297
3430531,2,B00199PPCE,"P. D. James is Britain's ""Queen of Crime,"" arguably the best of England's crime writers. She is able to write a good mystery that is a fine novel. Yet, this film is, in my opinion, not good.

 The film is 310 minutes long. It is broken into six segments, and was apparently shown on British TV in six installments, perhaps a week apart. The film is too drawn out. It could have been done better in two or at most two and a half hours. It has so many characters that add so many red herrings that the film begins to look like an overripe fish soup and not an exciting drama. Adam Dalgliesh, James' usual Scotland Yard detective, is on holiday in a village and doesn't have the key role in the investigation. He moves about from time to time and talks to people. This and the many unnecessary events and discussions weaken interest in the tale and add confusion.

 A number of women are killed in mysterious ways in the village by a man the villagers call ""the whistler."" An atomic power plant's computer is invaded by a virus. The director of the plant is having an affair with one of his employees as well as another woman. He doesn't know who is sabotaging his computer system or why. The woman he is having an affair with is murdered, seemingly by the whistler. Is this a single case, two, three, or more? The local police interview more than half a dozen suspects and several ask others to lie about their whereabouts during the murder.",1310601600,3,1439,4.398496240601504
3430532,5,B00199PPCE,"If it says P D James, and Roy Marsden is in it, - BUY it. This is one more of the Adam Dalgliesh mysteries that P D James has written. These are way above good.
