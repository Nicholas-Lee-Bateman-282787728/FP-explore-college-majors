7903805,5,B0000066IC,"Totally Underrated Series-While the 1st OVA of ROD is still my favourite. This still doesnt discount the series intellectual storyline! its exciting ,Very Clever &unique and belongs in your anime collection",1385683200,,206,5.67741935483871
7903806,4,B0000066IC,"This is an excellent series if you like thoughtful characters and clever stories.  Classical anime in many ways, but enough twists and turns to keep you watching!  One of the better series.  I bought this edition to complete my library as I had a flawed factory disc (from Malaysia?), which may not have been OEM. Subtitles were good, not perfect, but the dubbing was bad as usual.  I prefer to listen to the subtleties of the Japanese language anyways. If you like mysteries, not much violence, dedication to family and friends, you won't be disappointed.",1290816000,,556,4.821052631578947
7903807,5,B0000066IC,"Read or Die TV is rapidly becoming my favorite anime series.  The premise is original and fresh, the characters multi-dimensional, and the storyline compelling.  Although watching the original Read or Die isn't absolutely necessary to understand the TV series, it is helpful as background information (and is compelling in it's own right).

What really sets this series apart for me are the characters, perhaps because I am a bookworm as well and can identify with them.  Additionally, the stereotype of the wimpy bookworm is turned on its head by the butt kicking abilities of the Paper Masters.  Great action, great story, great characters -- this series is a winner.",1100563200,7,669,5.10091743119266
