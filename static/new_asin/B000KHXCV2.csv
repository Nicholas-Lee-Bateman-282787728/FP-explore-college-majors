8157066,1,B000KHXCV2,"Wish I'd read the 1st review before we rented, agree 100%. This is not a video. Fast forwarded through, playing briefly here and there, and gave up part way.

If you want to see uncaptioned, old, low resolution holidays snaps, with the same zoom and fade transition between each. Not to mention zero commentary, just some lousy elevator smooth Jazz - prepare for a deathly dull hour.",1348358400,,383,4.7164179104477615
8157067,1,B000KHXCV2,"This is not a film, but a lame concatenation of still photographs.  I am very dissatisfied, and if it weren't such a piddling amount, I would ask for a refund...",1185148800,2,161,4.366666666666666
8157068,1,B000KHXCV2,I have never encountered a travel guide without any narration or description of sights.  I have been to Hong Kong several times and knew what I was looking at.  I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD to view with friends who had not been to Hong Kong.  An unfamiliar viewer could have been looking at pictures of Rio or Seattle.  A complete waste of time and money.,1180137600,2,368,4.367647058823529
8157069,1,B000KHXCV2,"I eagerly awaited receiving the ""Hong Kong, City of Dreams"" DVD travel guide I recently ordered.  I have been to Hong Kong on a number of occasions, and I had hoped the DVD might be helpful to provide new ideas for my next visit and allow me to ""revisit"" the places I've already enjoyed.  There is no other way to describe this DVD than a total, complete, and utter waste of time (and your money, if you fall into the trap of buying it like I did).  This DVD is not worth $1.99, much less $21.99.  I have purchased many DVDs from Amazon, and have never before been compelled to write a review, but I really felt the need to do so here as a public service.  This garbage has to be described to be believed.  The DVD is comprised of a screen-saver slide show of images (actually most screen-savers are better) flashed over a ""Kenny G""-like soundtrack without any description whatsoever of what the pictures are meant to depict, followed by ""Chapters"" that are really nothing more than minimally descriptive written-word PowerPoint slides accompanied by thumbnail photos.  There is not a single spoken word of guidance -- or even description -- on the entire DVD.  It is almost as if someone simply photographed pages from a mediocre brochure and burned them onto a DVD.  I've never just thrown out a DVD that I've just purchased . . . until now.  The only difficulty is trying to spot the recycling code to see if I can at least be socially responsible about it.",1172707200,6,1460,4.517110266159696
8157070,5,B000KHXCV2,"I really enjoyed this travel guide to Hong Kong. It gives you plenty of insights on where to go, what to see, and where to stay, no matter your class of travel. I really enjoyed how this DVD lets you choose when and what to see in a customizable fashion. Even though I only was in Hong Kong for a few days this DVD helped me organize my time for the best! I would recommend this one to anyone who is planning a trip to Hong Kong or who would like to know more about this fantastic city.",1165017600,3,486,3.9693877551020407
