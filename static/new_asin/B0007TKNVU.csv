2243248,5,B0007TKNVU,"Love watching the evolvement of the quantum physics world merge with spirituality...As a right and left brainer, I found this lecture to be quite brilliant and summarize very important theories...",1496448000,3,196,5.566666666666666
2243249,4,B0007TKNVU,"Check out this lecture.
George and Majorie De La Warr had very interesting information.
Watch and understand our universe better!",1493942400,3,129,5.5
2243250,5,B0007TKNVU,I love this!,1460160000,,12,3.3333333333333335
2243251,5,B0007TKNVU,Great lecture.,1432771200,,14,6.5
2243252,4,B0007TKNVU,"...his book doesn't get five stars because the author fell prey to an ESP ruse that, unfortunately, was included in this thought-provoking work. The scammer was debunked after ""The Quantum Hologram and ESP"" was published. Nevertheless, Dr. Mitchell was a courageous pioneer of the mind and spirit and if you're interested in ESP this is a worthwhile read.",1404172800,4,355,5.137931034482759
2243253,5,B0007TKNVU,"You can't ask for anyone more qualified than Dr. Edgar Mitchell, former Apollo 14 astronaut, the sixth man on the moon to talk about subjects like these. Very interesting DVD.",1399593600,,175,4.866666666666666
2243254,5,B0007TKNVU,I bought this item as a present for my husband.  He was into Edgar Mitchell.  He said it was a great item.,1358380800,3,106,3.772727272727273
2243255,5,B0007TKNVU,The DVD was excellent and revealed experimental evidence for energy transmission and reception from the human brain.,1187827200,9,116,5.882352941176471
2243256,2,B0007TKNVU,"The moonwalk image on the DVD cover is misleading since there is hardly any mention of that experience in this DVD.  Also, the format was not what I expected. However, there was information in Dr Mitchell's lecture to connect-the-dots between science and ESP research in recent years--primarily methodology to support quantum basis for sensory/extra-sensory data processing.  Promising work is going on.

The lecture could have been presented in an audio version as effectively (with a card listing his talking points).",1168300800,23,519,5.4625
2243257,5,B0007TKNVU,"Apollo 14 astronaut, Edgar Mitchell shares his explanation for ESP and psychic phenomenon.  The Quantum Hologram discusses a breakthrough in quantum physics.  He also shares a secret psychic test conducted on the moon.",1119657600,37,218,5.575757575757576
2243298,5,B0007TKNVU,"A wonderful documentary, frustrating only because I so wished I had a solid background in quantum mechanics/physics to better understand Dr. Mitchell's remarks. Nevertheless, much of his presentation is accessible to an attentive lay audience.",1502928000,,243,5.9714285714285715
2243299,3,B0007TKNVU,"This recorded seminar would have translated much better in written form, such as a book.
The information is interesting and ties a lot of various theories together, and presents new, fascinating theories,
But unfortunately the way this information is presented, in a slow, plodding, monotone form, removes any excitement about the actual subject matter.
In short...wait until the book comes out!",1502841600,,395,5.491803278688525
2243300,1,B0007TKNVU,"No matter how many times he is saying this is very scientific, the way he made the statements are clearly not rational, not logic and not scientific. He was just saying anything without proof. If the self-reference things of particle he mentioned ""solves"" the renormalization problem in QED, there must be math in it. But he showed none.

Save your time. If you want to know what he did, just google the authors he mentioned in the video.",1502323200,,438,4.615384615384615
2243301,1,B0007TKNVU,Unless your a physicist don't bother watching.,1501718400,,46,5.714285714285714
2243302,1,B0007TKNVU,"Insufferably dull and plodding. He rambles on and on and on, and there's no payoff.",1501718400,,83,4.6
2243303,5,B0007TKNVU,"Fascinating!  Ties together so many plain and simple truths that are  captured and utilized in theory:  MBTI, Tribal Leadership, works of Stephen Covey, and organizations like Viital Smarts...  It's all about information and our ability to process it (communication, personality, trust, synergy).  It's all related and just as real as our physical reality!  Thanks to Dr. Mitchell and all the other brilliant minds of the world for having the courage to explore, pursue, and share!",1501286400,,481,5.346666666666667
2243304,1,B0007TKNVU,"I could not make much past the first fifteen minutes, all this guy does is drone on about stuff that is not very interesting.",1501286400,2,125,4.25
2243305,5,B0007TKNVU,"OK I have now gone to the other side. As an engineer and person who believes in science and the scientific method, I usually skipped right past any of the UFO or pseudo-science stuff. I think I clicked on this because of the involvement of a former astronaut. Glad I did. There is no psycho-babble BS here. All things discussed were completely reasonable and rooted in real science. Took me by surprise. Also surprising that evidence indicates the many-worlds theories and multidimensional stuff is wrong. Mitchell is well educated and intelligent and this talk demonstrates that.",1501113600,2,580,5.052083333333333
2243306,5,B0007TKNVU,It opened Pandora's box in my mind.,1501113600,,35,4.142857142857143
2243307,1,B0007TKNVU,"I grew up glued to the TV during the alleged moon landings - I was 6 in 1969. This should have interested me, but Mitchell's approach is Slow and rambling - he takes forever to get to a point. A quarter of the movie in, for all the talking he still hadn't really said anything, that's as much as I could stand before turning it off - he may have missed his calling as a politician.

There are FAR better films about those events.",1496707200,2,429,4.107142857142857
8051588,5,B0007TKNVU,Great info and presentation! Look beyond the low budget video and this will give some food for thought.,1516406400,,103,4.777777777777778
8051589,5,B0007TKNVU,"Dr. Edgar Mitchell presented a brilliant and elegant explanation of quantum entanglement
as a nonlocal phase conjugate adaptive resonance projected onto a 3-D spatial and 1-D
temporal continuum modeled as a quantum hologram. The model formulated provided
a theoretical basis for an understanding of human perception, extra-sensory perception,
remote viewing, as well as human consciousness. As such, his exposition was
awe-inspiring.",1515110400,,433,6.114754098360656
8051590,1,B0007TKNVU,"Completely stupid.  This guy spends an hour talking like a salesman for a multilevel marketing scheme; lots of adjectives and name references, but no actual substance.  Who is giving this 5 star reviews?  He does not cover a single piece of factual information.

In the beginning he says he has 45 minutes of material.  Uhh no, he has zero minutes of material and an hour's worth of smoke and mirrors.",1514678400,,401,4.671428571428572
8051591,5,B0007TKNVU,"So essentially as we interact with our physical universe around us we each affect the overall universe.  Even in isolation.  If you decide to hit a wall or not to that defines a specific outcome in our universe.

Really reaffirmed to me that we literally are in the struggle of life (existence) together.  What one chooses to do with their existence, no matter how insignificant really does affect everyone else on a quantum scale.

Fascinating. Science is awesome.",1513296000,,465,4.910256410256411
8051592,4,B0007TKNVU,This is such an interesting topic but drawn out and tedious. I think this guy would do better if he had more slides.,1513123200,,116,4.086956521739131
8051593,5,B0007TKNVU,The audio is bad but great mind blowing information. Thanks you Edger Mitchell!,1513036800,,79,5.153846153846154
8051594,4,B0007TKNVU,"I'm not a scientist and would have really appreciated graphics on some of the information talked about. The speaker does however enlighten us
that nothing has been published yet so he is unable to show us graphics or films during his lecture. I still enjoyed it, although I was also looking forward to the audience asking questions which are cut out of this presentation.",1507939200,,371,4.8125
8051595,5,B0007TKNVU,Ordered this as a gift in the recipient loved it,1506211200,,48,3.9
8051596,2,B0007TKNVU,sounded good and interesting until he mentioned working with Uri Geller the notorious con artist-magician who was totally debunked by James Randi.  everything he said lost all scientific legitimacy after that.,1505606400,2,209,5.741935483870968
8051597,1,B0007TKNVU,"References ""around"" information and mentions eminent minds, without actually relating any actual data or real research.  Employs many of the conversational and presentation techniques of conspiracy theorists, with only pseudoscientific speak that references details and complicated techniques without backing up any of the points with actual experimental evidence or rationale.",1503705600,3,377,6.54
