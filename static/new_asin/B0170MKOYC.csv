8737761,5,B0170MKOYC,"The ""Hitchcock"" (as I call it) Double Feature DVD is the third Sony Double Feature DVD I have purchased this year, after ""RV/Jumanji"" and ""Daddy Day Care/Daddy Day Camp"". Like the other two, ""Hitchcock"" is two movies one one disc. There is a static menu that allows you to choose which movie you want to watch. There are no subtitles, but the menu says ""English Closed Captions Available"". ""Hancock"" appears to be the PG-13 Theatrical Version and not the Unrated Special Edition. $3.74 for two movies is a great deal, considering that both movies individually are over $5 each.",1478304000,,577,4.838383838383838
