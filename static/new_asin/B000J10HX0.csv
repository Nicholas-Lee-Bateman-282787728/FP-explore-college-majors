French is a touching scene...King shoots Steele's father and leaves him for dead, but what if King thought he was a ghost...could it be there might be some confessing of past sins in this last reel, that will be King's undoing and let Steele have the heroine...no doubt about it when Bob Steele and Charlie King lock horns it's a show-stopper....another great B-Western from Bob Steele under the Supreme Picture banner, proves to be one of his most dramatic performances.
