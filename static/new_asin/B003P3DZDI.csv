4163528,4,B003P3DZDI,"This movie was actually a lot better than I expected, and had some hilarious moments. I can relate to some of the things that happened to Greg. I have not read the book, so I couldn't compare it. 12 year old Greg Heffley is nervous about starting middle school. Him and his dorky best friend, Rowley Jefferson try to fit in and become popular, but that's easier said than done. Throughout the school year, Greg and Rowley come up with weird ways to become popular like being a Safety Patrol officer, wrestling, and performing in epic school plays. In order to truly appreciate this film, you either need to be a parent, or think from the perspective of a kid. I highly recommend DIARY OF A WIMPY KID!!!",1270598400,53,702,4.4921875
4163529,3,B003P3DZDI,"My wife had a special ""Girls Night Out"" party at our house this week, so she booted me and the kids out of the house and it was up to me to find something for us all to do. I haven't been to a theater in ages to see a movie so....

I wanted to see the Clash of the Titans remake, but I was a few days too early prior to its release. So it was between Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland sequel and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I picked Alice, but my two kids that are big fans of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book-series/dp/0810993139/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book series</a>&nbsp;outvoted me and picked Wimpy Kid.

Ultimately my kids liked the movie and so did I. But there was something very familiar about the movie, and I've never even seen page 1 of any of the books. My kids both said that the familiarity came from how closely the movie followed the books...or should I say `book'. Because my oldest (age 11) said that almost the entire movie was from just the first book in the series (which I can neither confirm nor deny). But if my oldest is correct, this of course suggests a wide open door for sequels aplenty.

But I've got a better idea than Wimpy Kid big screen sequels. How about a TV series? Ah...that's it! That's where the familiarity is for me! Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminds me of and is very similar to the Nickelodeon TV series that ran between 2004 and 2007 called Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. Coincidentally(?), The Wimpy Kid book series picked up right as the Ned TV series came to an end in 2007.

Both Ned's Declassified and Wimpy Kid follow the same story line: The ups & downs, the ins & outs, the trials & tribulations, and most importantly the rights and wrongs of making it through middle school and managing friendships therein.

Of all the Nickelodeon shows that I've ever sat in for as my kids watched, I think that Ned was definitely the most educational, while at the same time being funny and entertaining. Wimpy Kid fits the exact same mold, but it's like trying to take a lot of Ned episodes and cram them all into one two-hour feature film.

So my verdict would be to forgo the trip to the theater for Wimpy Kid and instead really get your money's worth by purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-1-of-Ned/dp/B001EHDSTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season 1 of Ned</a>&nbsp;for many more hours of middle school entertainment. Wait for the Blu Ray/DVD or even cable release of Wimpy Kid. And if you run out of Ned's season 1 episodes prior to Wimpy Kid's DVD release, you can always go for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-2-of-Ned/dp/B001EHDSTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season 2 of Ned</a>.",1269993600,,2788,5.076419213973799
4163530,3,B003P3DZDI,"As I watched ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"" I kept thinking back to my own middle school days and eventually realized that none of them were being depicted accurately. This goes beyond a mere sequence of events; the attitudes, emotions, and behaviors expressed by these kids -- and the adults, for that matter -- are not based in reality, at least not the reality I've been a part of. Maybe I was lucky. Or maybe the filmmakers didn't have a clue. Whatever the case, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" exists on a channel outside my range of communication. I wasn't entertained by the characters, I didn't find any of the situations relatable, and I never laughed or even chuckled, although I did smile with satisfaction when the drama teacher auditioned her students with ""Total Eclipse of the Heart,"" my favorite song.

Part of the problem is that the title character, whose name is actually Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon), is in fact not wimpy. Unfortunate, maybe; ever since entering middle school, he often finds himself in very humiliating and/or dangerous situations, not the least of which is ending up on the front page of the school newspaper after being beaten by a girl in wrestling. Her name is Patty Farrell (Laine MacNeil), and she's loud, bossy, aggressive, and just plain mean. Greg sometimes has to ward off Fregley (Grayson Russell), a kid so weird, disgusting, and nerdy that it's a wonder he isn't hanging by the elastic strap of his underwear everyday at lunch. Because he's unaware of his weirdness, because he doesn't worry about impressing those around him, he may be the happiest kid in the whole school.

Should I have felt sorry for Greg? I assume I was supposed to, although I found it difficult, probably because most of his problems were brought on by no one other than himself. They stem, naturally, from the idea that one must be popular in order to survive middle school. He periodically shares his thoughts and feelings via a diary (although he insists it's actually a journal) and a series of hand drawn cartoons, and they slowly reveal a kid that isn't as likable as he initially seemed.

A major source of embarrassment for him is his best friend, Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron), a chubby, innocent, socially awkward boy who doesn't seem ready to grow up. How much does Greg like Rowley? ""Maybe I can fix him,"" he writes in his journal, ""because that's the kind of friend I am."" Nice. But the joke's on Greg; his hurtful actions only help Rowley become more popular, especially with girls.

Meanwhile, back at home, Greg has to put up with an embarrassing mom (Rachael Harris), a clueless dad (Steve Zahn), an annoying baby brother (Conner and Owen Fielding), and Rodrick, his older brother (Devon Bostick), who does whatever he can to make Greg's life a living hell. There are a few scenes in which he gives Greg advice about surviving middle school, which include not talking to anyone, not sitting next to anyone, and not getting involved in extracurricular activities. Interesting, I thought -- he may be trying to spare Greg the hardships he went through in middle school, and his bullying is just his way of toughening the kid up. Could it be? A complex character I could actually invest in? Alas, no. Rodrick is a jerk, plain and simple.

I've often complained about movies that do more to deaden a child's imagination than ignite it. ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" does something just as bad: It makes children laugh not through genuinely funny situations, but simply by being gross. By the end of the film, we will have witnessed a booger smeared on a piece of paper, a fart aimed directly at a kid's head, and someone getting peed on. And let us not forget a running gag about a school legend known as the Cheese Touch, which involves a slice of Swiss that has been left to rot on the Basketball court for who knows how long.

The movie is directed by Thor Freudenthal, who a year ago helmed the equally ridiculous ""Hotel for Dogs."" It's also based on the book by Jeff Kinney, which, I admit, I haven't read. Does this mean I was unprepared to review the film? I don't think so; it's not a question of being faithful to the source material but of how it resonates with an audience. As hard as I try, I can't imagine anyone relating to this story. There is no truth in it, not even on an emotional level. It's a strange and ugly experience, and it perpetuates a sense of humor that appeals to the lowest common denominator. For a truly resonant film about adolescence and those difficult periods of adjustment, I recommend you log onto Netflix and order a copy of ""Where the Wild Things Are.""",1268956800,10,4613,4.647058823529412
4163531,4,B003P3DZDI,"(Based on the movie, not on the DVD) Hi, this is Andrea, and I'm going to review the newest movie ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"". I read this book in Middle school, I know that might seem a little weird since I'm a girl and this is more of a boy book, but whatever. I liked the book, however I didn't like the sequels. Rodrick Rules was okay, and The Last Straw was a little worse. I haven't even read Dog Days yet. After the first book, the books just started getting less funny and more boring in my opinion. However, I did still like the first book, and when I heard there was a movie coming out for it, I definitely wanted to see it.

I have to say, the movie was way better than I expected. All the actors did a great job portraying the characters in the book. Now like many people, when I saw the trailer, I thought the kid playing Greg looked a little too young. But in a way, he looked, sounded, reminded me of Devin Workiser (or Ned Bigby) from the first season in the show Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, so I kept an open mind. I have to say, he did a great job. Even though I haven't read the book in like two years, everything seemed just right to me, and nothing seemed wrong or poorly done.

Some negatives I have are that there was a little too gross humor for me. There were times I had to close my eyes just so I wouldn't upchuck my M&Ms. But I guess that was forgiven, since there are many great and funny moments throughout the movie. But one comment I have, in the movie they have Greg's drawings, but they gave them a sorts CGI look to them. I can't really explain it, but it looked weird, and I don't know why they couldn't just stick with 2D animation. But I have to say, I really like the ending of the movie, the lesson of Friendship really shines through. I think this is one of the rare occasions where the movie is just a tad bit better than the book. Also, I know this has nothing to do with the story or anything but I have to say, I loved the song they played during the credits. I've heard it on those Nerf gun commercials, and I loved it immediately. Hearing the full song after a great movie, just left a smile on my face.

If you are a fan of the books, I think you will be very pleased with this movie. They did a great job sticking close to the book, there were only a few things that weren't part of the book, but they are easily forgiven and forgettable. While I wouldn't buy it on DVD when it comes out, I do think that everyone should see it at least once. An 8 out of 10.",1268956800,,2516,4.048192771084337

I was a bit hesitant to let him watch it since it is about kids in middle school and has some middle school aged appropriate content but I watched it with him and found it to be age appropriate for him. He absolutely loves his movie and has watched it numerous times and has even started reading the book because of it. It's a cute movie about underdog kids comin out on top, the troubles of middle school and friendship. It does have some crude humor, the type that middle school boys (and my 7 year old boy) find hilarious but other than that it is pretty harmless.

4163657,4,B003P3DZDI,"Like most adults, I was under the impression that the wimpy kid series was nothing more than the latest fad in youth literature to hit the big screen. I figured it was just another kids movie and passed it off as such, but recently at a family event, I was forced to see parts of it and found it interesting, so I queued it up and as it turns out, this film was legitimately funny! Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is about to start middle school, where all he wants to do is become popular, like his older brother was. Greg goes to extremes and displays some very odd behavior, as he and his best friend, try to enter the elite club of popularity. What's really interesting about these films are that most of the cast members have limited to no experience what-so-ever before being cast in a major motion picture. Some of them, like Gordon, are really talented, while others like Robert Capron are just awkward kids, who are just naturally funny in the way they carry themselves. The dynamics of a family film are always a very difficult thing, because if you don't take a few risks, it's a kids movie that the adults with be bored with. On the other hand, if you go too far, the film will get a PG-13, which means the kids won't be allowed to see it and your audience becomes very limited. The writers of Diary of a Wimpy Kid found the magic formula however, as they managed to create a cult classic, that is fun for kids, teens, and adults alike. The film has it moments and at least a few things that every single one of us can relate to. It certainly isn't goodfellas, but I thought this film was a lot of fun, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually looking forward to checking out the sequels.",1470009600,,1711,4.333333333333333

the plot

Greg is a middle child in the Heffley family and he is starting one of the most trying times in the American life...middle school.  The constant pressure of how to fit in is relentless for Greg, yet somehow this importance was lost on his best friend Rowley.  Greg who was so sure that he would be accepted among the elite groups of students instead finds himself sitting on the cafeteria floor during his lunch period next to the garbage cans with Rowley and the ultimate outcast Fregley.  He tries some different strategies to get in that closed door of acceptance, but for some reason they all seem to backfire.

One of his plans came about when an opportunity presented itself where he can become a school safety monitor.  He and Rowley do become monitors, they don the orange jackets and because of their duties, they must miss a portion of their school schedule in order to walk a group of kindergarten kids home, and also when they patrol the halls.  Somehow Greg messes up this opportunity too with comedic results.

In order to upgrade his status in middle school, it seems like Greg is going to have to hit rock bottom first and learn some valuable life lessons.

the breakdown

Earlier this year, one of the best parts of bedtime with my eight-year-old son was lying in his bed and reading his Diary of a Wimpy Kid books together.  We'd be laughing out loud at the very funny stories and one-liners always making my wife curious about what was going on instead of sleeping.  I can probably say that the film version of Jeff Kinney's book is just as funny.  We all laughed out loud and at the same funny scenes that we remember from the book.

Yeah, it's true that there was very little deviation from the book, except for the addition of a couple of characters, namely Angie Steadman played by Chloe Moretz (The Amityville Horror).  The lack of any new gags for the film version did not deter the big laughs, and the Angie character added to the perpetual refusal of Greg to see what is right in front of him and appreciate it.  His desire to fit in has blinded him to Rowley's mother's great advice to just be yourself, and blind to the fact that an attractive older female has taken interest in him.  Instead, he rather heeds the advice of his evil older brother Roderick.  Because of this he keeps finding himself alone, shunned by the student body until he has no friends at all...except for Fregley that is.

Zachary Gordon plays Greg Heffley with the desired outcome.  Although he is the star of the film, you still end up despising his antics just as the students do.  Yet, you still root for him silently to yourself as you wait for him to learn his lesson.  Gordon does effectively get you frustrated and that's a good thing.  In the same way, you fall in love with the ultimate reject Rowley, played by Robert Capron.  I didn't expect someone like Capron to be what Rowley looks like.  Rowley in the book is sketched with a look on his face that looks like duh'.  Capron's chunky appearance and infectious smile makes him more likeable than the book version does.  This film version of Rowley is more clueless, yet smart - where the book version of Rowley seems less smart.  They're both equally as likeable, and Robert Capron gives the best performance of any of the kids. Steve Zhan, one of my favorite actors is unfortunately used very minimally, while the relatively annoying Rachael Harris may be used a little too much.  But then again, this is the way the story's written.  I think Zhan will get more screen time in the sequel coming out in March of 2011, Roderick Rules.

This movie got a PG rating probably because some of the humor has to do with bullying, boogers, butts and a disgusting moldy piece of Swiss cheese that remained on the blacktop of the school playground for years.  But, there's really nothing offensive or objectionable, except for the boogers, which may make you squirm.  This is a triumph in family movies as it does teach a valuable lesson or two while at the same time being highly entertaining.  I give this four stars.

The story is adapted to a film format about a year in the life of Gregg Heffley going into middle school. He lives with parents and siblings in suburbia (location undisclosed).

Gregg is the middle child and his older brother teases and picks on him. Gregg wants to be cool at school but he hangs out with the uncool kids who are his true friends.

The film is fine for family viewing and even classroom viewing in schools. The DVD comes with extra features such as deleted scenes. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is very popular among young readers especially boys out there. No reading is required to follow the story.",1441065600,,785,4.560283687943262

4163840,4,B003P3DZDI,"Theres a series of books called Diary of a Wimpy Kid and presumably (I haven't read any of them) this first film is based on them.  Altogether the books are a series of 8, plus a workbook so, you could also say, a series of 9
The main character in this film is Greg Heffley, just entering 7th grade with high hopes of rising rapidly to be one of the most popular students.  Alas, his dreams seem threatened by his un-cool friend Rowley, and every avenue he tries to gain attention and popularity seems to be thwarted.  At first Rowley always seems to be the problem, or perhaps the even more nerdy Fregley, oror well, ultimately he has to face the factHE is the problem.  Hes so intent on gaining popularity via superficiality that he has become his own worst enemyand one lousy friend.

In short this is a charming little film focused on a middle-school crowd (and with action and dialog that parents should not find objectionable).  Even betterit does not look for laughs by making the parents seem like idiots.  In fact the parents, teachers and other school staff come across as both reasonable and concerned, but unfortunately as with all of us, not able to live kids lives for them.  So ultimately its up to Heffley himself to realize that hes his own worst enemy.  To put it in the more adult terms I once heard a comedian use in his act: you know that horrible blind date you ended up with one time?  I realizedI AM that horrible blind date!  Other lessons along the way naturally include not putting others down based on appearances, and that the best way to be liked is to genuinely like other people of all types.  It imparts all these lessons with plenty of comedy along with the requisite seriousness, so it looks enjoyable to a wide audience.  In fact it's unclear to me why its rating is even PG; it seemed more G to me, but regardless it's a film that older kids in particular and their parents may enjoy watching together.  I recommend it.",1422576000,7,1956,4.473239436619719

The way they brought the animation into the movie with the stick figure was pretty interesting  I didn't like how Greg acted from the middle to almost the end of the movie, and his brother and a few other older bullies seemed horribly mean..  He was cute in the beginning but a little too mean in the middle and end.  There were definitely parts that made me laugh and other parts that really grossed me out.  I liked that there was no bad language.  In all a pretty good movie for kids.",1419724800,,526,4.2

I did not like that they showed a scantily clad cover of a magazine that is supposed to be pornographic. This movie is supposed to be for children and I thought that it was a let down in that aspect.

4163896,3,B003P3DZDI,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an adaptation of a popular childrens series which follows sixth-grader Greg
Heffley and his desires to become cool. Of course, we all know that being a cool sixth-grader is an
oxymoron. Yet this film is not filled with wizards, or dragons (or disappearing cats)  just the ordinary daily
activities that every child goes through. Consider that school, family, and friends can have just as much
drama and excitement as falling down a rabbit hole.

There are jokes in Wimpy Kid that are clearly geared towards children, and I thought I was watching a
bad sitcom (but I don't blame producers 20th Century Fox for this but rather Pixar for making a children
movie entertaining for adults). But I am sure children will recognize a bit of themselves in Gregs exploits,
and hopefully see that you don't need to go into a magic land to discover who you are.",1408406400,,872,4.6558441558441555

4163906,5,B003P3DZDI,"I love these movies! I saw this with my mom when it first came out. Even though I was eighteen, I got a real kick out of this movie. All three of the movies are great -- they are true to what life is like when you're in middle school (at least for me). The scenarios presented in the movie are pretty over-the-top, but in a hilarious and highly entertaining way. The story is touching without ever growing too serious. I've watched this movie many times, and it always makes my heart and spirit feel light, happy, and nostalgic for my childhood. These movies are great for people of all ages. They are excellent family-night movies -- there is very little swearing (if any at all), there aren't any random sex scenes, no misplaced sexual innuendos, etc. Another thing I love about this movie: it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's fun, goofy, and openly makes fun of things that most people can relate to.

My favorite scenes: Zoo-wee-mama!, The Cheese Touch, The Satan Worshiper Woods, that weird red-headed kid with the ""secret freckle"", Greg's dad vs. marauding teenagers, and Roderick's Halloween eyeliner.",1405296000,,1115,4.77720207253886

It helps him to understand the common experiences he has at school and play with other kids like Wimpy"".  We discuss the situations later and gain insight into why certain behaviors work or don't work and about the qualities of having a good friendship and relationship with siblings and parents.  The author is so insightful in how he decides on a story line and develops the characters.  I purchased the next book and DVD as well called ""Rodrick Rules"", as Rodrick is the older brother who gives his younger brother a hard time.  Again, this story was a huge hit with my grandson and he loves to view it over and over.  It creates a great deal of laughter and is a terrific video for the entire family to watch.

The other two were terrible recording quality like cheap dubbing to where the film could not be seen very well with white dots all over the screen and sound quality was also terrible. This DVD was the only normal one for some reason. I was very disappointed as it ruined my Diary of a Wimpy Kid marathon movie party.

4163974,1,B003P3DZDI,"I love the Diary of a wimpy kid series, and I love the books, and I really wanted to like this movie, but it was unbelievably bad. Not like the book at all. This film lacks the heart and effort put into the book.

The film lacks the morals that the book had which was intended for children. This film is also inappropriate for children. Showing dirty magazines of girls in skimpy clothing? Not only did it bother me that Rodrick's mother got so angry at him for something so little, but to put that in a kids movie? Also, what was the big deal about Rodrick having dirty magazines? He is a grown teenager, that is normal. And then to make him apologize to all the women as if he is disrespecting them, when they are the ones who star in the magazine, is completely absurd! That scene was not neccessary for a kids movie.

Almost universally bad casting. The characters look nothing like as depicted in the book. Greg was all wrong. The point of the book was that you felt sorry for him for being such a shy wimp, but throughout the entire film it feels as if he is doing all of this to himself, and just whining over nothing. He criticized Angie for no reason. Rowley had a bigger personality than Greg. I was bullied a lot through middle school, so I wanted to feel bad for Greg, but this was ridiculous!

Bottom line, this film was a huge let down, but remember, this is just my opinion, so see for yourself, and decide from here. Diary of a wimpy kid was just a moneymaker, nothing more.",1373414400,2,1490,4.276595744680851

4163977,4,B003P3DZDI,"In 2004, game designer/cartoonist Jeff Kinney wrote the realistic fiction novel ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"".

While the story first appeared on FunBrain.com in 2004 (and read over 20 million times), the hardcover version was released in 2007 and became a New York Times best seller earning critical acclaim and winning many awards.

Since ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", Kinney has since written nine ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel"" books and also created the popular online, role-playing game ""Poptropica"".

But also, a total of three film adaptations were created and the first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" film was released in theaters in 2010.  Made with a budget of $15 million, the film would go on to earn over $75 million in the box office.

VIDEO:

""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks great on Blu-ray.  Skin tones are natural, picture quality is very colorful, black levels are nice and deep.  There is a thin layer of grain and the overall look of the film is warm.  I didn't notice any artifacts, edge enhancement or excessive DNR while watching the film on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish and French Dolby Digital.  For a film such as ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", a lot of lossless audio is primarily dialogue.  The film does have quite a bit of music which come alive during the film and shows good dynamic range.  There is not a whole lot of ambiance for the film, but dialogue and music is crystal clear, no an immersive soundtrack but is appropriate for this type of film.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" comes with the following special features:

  Feature Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Thor Freudenthal and writer Gabe Sachs.
  Deleted Diary Pages - A few short featurettes which include the short featurettes such as  Fregley's Scavenger Hunt (2:56) which grossed out my wife, Chirag's Trail of Tears (2:37) which shows locations of where he has been bullied, Fregley's Shuffle (:47) and the film's deleted scenes: Mom Drops Greg  Off at School, Greg and Rowley Jump Over the Wall, Mr. Winsky's Safety Patrol Assignment, Mom Suggests a Friendship Card, Greg Meets Fregley's mom, Greg has the Cheese Touch and there is also a gallery (which you need to use your remote) to view five of Rowley's Lost ""Zoo-Wee Mama"" cartoons.
  And Now a Word from Our Author - (3:39) Author Jeff Kinney talks with young actors Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron about the film.  This featurette is a Blu-ray exclusive.

EXTRAS:

The version of ""Diary of Wimpy Kid"" that I am reviewing comes with a DVD and also a Digital Copy of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a parent of a child who is captivated with each yearly book release of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"", for years I have seen him laugh and reference the book (especially the ""cheese touch"") many times.  Even learning a few things from the book that we had to discipline him a few times.

But for the most part, it's a book about the life of boys going into middle school and learning quickly about popularity and not wanting to be last in popularity. As much as we hope as parents that the experiences that we had back in school will no longer affect children these days, the fact is that it will continue to be a part of a student's life throughout grade school, even no matter what country you live in.  Children are faced with a lot of situations and some just don't want to be labeled unpopular or be mistreated by classmates.

""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is about a boy named Greg Heffley who desires to be popular but unfortunately, he is too fixated by it and each time he tries too achieve popularity, it backfires.

But what happens when Greg tries to impose his wanting to be popular on his friend Rowley (who just cares about being friends with Greg and not too interested of being popular).

While there is a lesson to be learned about Greg's attitude of wanting to be popular and even hurting his friendship with Rowley , I can understand the criticism by a few critics who have felt that the character of Greg Heffley is unpleasant.  And I have to agree.

If I was a parent of Rowley and found out another child was making him change or to partake in things that they are not interested in, my advice would be to enjoy life the way you want and if that friend doesn't accept you, don't hang out with them.

I have not read any of the ""Diary of the Wimpy Kid"" books but while I sat there watching alongside my wife and son, my wife would mutter ""that's not very nice!"" while my son, holding his first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" book, was really getting into the film.  Even I found myself saying ""what a jerk!"" when it came to Greg's actions.

But I suppose that is the case for not just Greg but a lot of people who try to change themselves to become popular.  Some are able to become athletes and discover their true potential, some exceed in other areas in school but some fail miserably.  Greg Heffley is the latter and has to learn through his experiences that he was not a good friend and he put his scheme of trying to be popular ahead of his own friendship with Rowley.  And there is a lesson to be learned with this film.

I suppose that children who read the book will enjoy this film, while parents may feel ""why is there a film about a kid who is a bad influence?"" or maybe even remind them of the troubles of their own past in grade school.  Personally, I looked at the film as a good example of karma.  What goes around, comes around and in the case of Greg Heffley, he learns an important lesson that being a jerk is not cool!

As for the Blu-ray release, you get an audio commentary, a few short featurettes including a disgusting featurette with the character of Fregley and deleted scenes.  And with this version that I am reviewing, the Blu-ray comes with a DVD and digital copy.  So, great for parents on a commute or wants to keep their children occupied with the film on their smartphone or tablet.

Overall, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" is an enjoyable film but I do acknowledge some of the concerns that parents have towards the main protagonist and his actions.  My son felt this is one of the best movies he watched and for me, I felt the film carries a lot of humor but also an intriguing take of one child's worries of becoming popular or unpopular in middle school.  But also featuring an important message at the end of the film that I felt children could learn from.

While some parents will be protective of their children and may not approve of the behavior of children as featured in this film, I do feel it's a family film that can encourage conversations between parents and their children but also a film that families can watch together.",1372896000,,6880,4.506860371267151

The film has some slight, but necessary departures from the text (otherwise the film would be a lot longer), and adds a female character who is in 7th grade, and is a photographer for the newspaper. And yet, the film remains loyal to the spirit of the written text. If you are a teacher using the text in class, showing the film, or a film clip, would be a useful compare and contrast activity. I did such activity with the Cheese Touch, which is one of the most memorable scenes for children. It turned out to be a useful activity that also helped build vocabulary. We could discuss point of view: in the book, Greg narrates the Cheese Touch story; in the film, it is told from Chirag Gupta's point of view. Also, students noticed effects used specifically for films, such as the spooky music, and hearing Gupta's mysterious voice. In sum, the film is a great experience for children.",1364256000,,964,4.578034682080925

4164003,1,B003P3DZDI,"My youngest son, 8, loves the ""Wimpy Kid"" series. After he begged us for the third time to rent this movie, bringing his piggy bank out to pay for it, again, from Amazon, I thought it would be nice to just buy it for him. When I saw the ""disc+"" offer, where you can buy the movie AND be able to watch it on-demand as a rental right away, I thought it would be perfect for us; he gets his ""wimpy kid"" fix now and we'd have a hard copy for later. The instructions in the advertisement state that we would get an e-mail about how to access the movie.  Sounds great, except the e-mail didn't come. Oh, I for sure got the invoice email about how I was billed for the movie, the expected shipping date, etc. But nothing in the emails about how to watch to rental on-demand version. Which was a big part of why I bought this when I did. And in case you were wondering, after looking for another 30 minutes I couldn't find a place on Amazon's web site where I could actually email a question about this. Just lots of circuitous loops around the help files. We are huge fans of Amazon and are Prime members. This experience, however, has not been pleasant. I went ahead and bought my son the 0n-demand rental seperately, as he was dissapointed that he wouldn't be able to watch it today as he was told he could. Would have been cheaper to drive out to Wally World and buy the movie there. At least I would have gotten what was advertised.",1364083200,,1429,4.2153284671532845

4164017,2,B003P3DZDI,"First off, I thought the movie would be animated as the book had many great cartoon images that are for kids. The book went into much more of the thoughts kids spend their time thinking about and presents them in a very thought provoking and funny way at their level of understanding. It shows kids that other kids have a lot of the same thoughts as they have. Except for maybe the first five minutes, the movie was not any of these things..",1360368000,,441,4.325301204819277

4164030,3,B003P3DZDI,"The movie version of the first book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series was released in 2010. It's pretty faithful to the book with the exception of the character Angie, who I don't remember being in the book. She is a seventh grader and serves as a mentor to Greg, who is only in sixth. She's played by Chlo Grace Moretz who I love in everything she does. She's such a fabulous actress (Let Me In, Dark Shadows) that it was weird seeing her in a goofy kids movie.

The acting by the other kids in this movie was good and not over the top cheesy like in some of those Disney channel tween shows. There was a fair amount of grossness that boys will love. My six and eight year old boys thought this movie was hilarious and were riveted by it. My attention started to wane for the last half of the movie, probably because having read the book, I already knew what was going to happen. Even though it wasn't my cup of tea, it was a great way to keep my boys entertained on a snowy afternoon.",1358208000,,987,4.1139896373057
4164031,5,B003P3DZDI,"I actually saw this series in a book store quite a while before the films came about.  I remember reading the part in the book where Greg is in swimming but is embarrassed about his bathing suit and then him describing the people in his school as being so out there.  The way the author illustrated this in his books felt so absolutely genuine that it brought me back to my childhood and what i thought as a kid to loath certain aspects of life at that age and how we come up with solutions that just end up making situations worse or at least memorably wrong at times.  Good times or bad,  IT WAS GREAT.  The movie version absolutely lives up to the book..  Hats off to Zachary Gordon who's narrative voice over observations and acting are so spot on that they give credit to the wonderful world Jeff Kinney has created.  Steve Zahn would have never been the dad I envisioned, but he is great and gives a whole new light on the character.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you love good wholesome fun from time to time and then watch the sequels because they are great too.",1358121600,,1085,4.284313725490196

4164033,3,B003P3DZDI,"Had some funny moments, but the kid is so tormented by his brother, older teenagers and schoolmates.

I have not read the books, so can't compare the movie to them, but both my husband and I did find this funny. As others have said, it centers on the nerdy protagonist Greg heading to middle school, and trying ploy after ploy to become popular. At first he does this alongside his even-nerdier best friend Rowley, but after betraying Rowley, Greg is on his own. He has to learn important lessons about friendship and loyalty, and so the movie has a good heart in the end.

The portrayal of middle school here is pretty disturbing, as well as the cluelessness of the parents involved, and I worried about how it would impact my elementary school-aged kids, so I tried to talk about that and they all rolled their eyes and said ""Mom, it's just a movie."" They seemed to get that some of it was for comedic effect. There is also some bullying themes, and sexual innuendos (including Greg's older brother being caught with porn) that they didn't get, and I had to dance my way around a bit. But mostly I felt it was fine for elementary-aged children (every parent has to judge this for themselves of course.) The interactions between the kids feel real (for better or for worse), and my kids seemed to respond to that, and in the end the message is really about the importance of friendship. loyalty,  and being yourself, so that I could support. And BTW, my daughters enjoyed it too - not just a boy series.",1340064000,,1507,4.436823104693141

It doesn't translate as well on screen but there are some very funny parts, most of them provided by older brother Roderick or best friend Rowley. In both parts the actors are standouts and clearly relish their roles. There was a bit more grossout scenes than I expected, in particular a scene with Greg relieving himself that I could have lived without. The movie feels somewhat muted compared to the book but is worth seeing for some humerous bits and good performances. Overall the movie is quite appropriate for the whole family, with the minor caution about the odd tasteless scene.",1311379200,,783,4.681159420289855

The irony that his friend and only friend would succeed accidentally at being popular where all of his attempts had failed was cute. The eating of the cheese was over the top, hence the 4 star instead of the 5.",1311379200,,453,4.159090909090909
4164102,4,B003P3DZDI,"As someone who never read these books and just watched it on a whim one night, I found this movie entertaining and laughed a lot at the way the actors portrayed their characters in situations that were obviously exaggerated for the big screen, yet nonetheless came off hysterically funny.  One of my favorite scenes is where Greg decides to try out for the school play and the song that the director/teacher makes the kids sing is ""Total Eclipse of the Heart.""  The mere choice of that song is brilliant in and of itself, but the way it's sung by the extras made me howl with laughter because they're so badly off-key and/or melodramatic that it brings to mind auditions for American Idol (the really bad ones)!

The characters all seem to fit except for the girl who takes photos for the school newspaper and hangs out under the bleachers (which is strange).  Her sage wisdom and advice to Greg and Rowley is fine but she never really fits in with the storyline.  It's like they just kind of throw her into a scene at random and there's no real benefit from it because nothing ever really comes of it.  I think they could/should have done more with her character.

The worst thing I can say about this movie is the way it disrespects Greg's mom and dad.  The mom is the one who seems to be most engaged with their boys and tries to discipline them and teach them about life, while the dad simply stands by mostly mute without much to add to the upbringing of their children.  Having not read the books, I am left to wonder if the characters are like that in the book.  If so, then I guess it's just in keeping with the author's writing, but it's very disappointing to see.  The only glimmer of hope is when the dad tells Greg, ""I think she deserved it"" after Greg (who plays an apple tree) begins an on-stage apple-throwing frenzy when he hurls an apple at the girl playing the part of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz; thus unceremoniously ending the play.  I agree.  Dorothy deserved it.  Greg thanks his dad and the two walk off with dad's arm around Greg's shoulder in a display of genuine fatherly affection and support.  Too bad there weren't more scenes like that.

There is a lot of mean-spirited behavior from Greg's brother Rodrick which wasn't dealt with by the parents.  That was frustrating to watch.  In real life siblings, and brothers especially, can be very mean to each other, but it would have been nice to see the parents do something about it instead of ignoring it or refusing to listen when Greg tried to tell them what really happened, like in the beginning scene where Rodrick wakes Greg up at 4AM telling him he'd better get moving or he'll be late for his first day of middle school.  As Greg rushes to get dressed, fed and so forth he wakes up the parents and his toddler brother; which gets Greg in trouble because now they can't get the toddler back to sleep.  When they find Rodrick in bed snoring they just presume Greg lied.  They don't stop to think that there's no logical reason for Greg to be up at 4AM rushing around trying to get ready for school.

The lessons Greg learns about friendship and popularity are hard but good.  The message is good in that department, eventually.

Still, when all is said and done, this movie is very entertaining and it made me laugh many times.  It's not easy to find a movie that is this entertaining and doesn't succumb to the usual foul language, crude sexual connotations and/or drug use that so many movies seem to these days.  Refreshingly clean and witty.  I really liked it.

If you watch with no expectations, as I did, you might like it too.",1311292800,,3618,4.465753424657534
4164103,4,B003P3DZDI,"This was a good movie. The essence of the books was transformed well to a movie. The characters were believable and it was easy to recognize who was who. The plot was not so exciting but then again the books don't have much of a plot either. All in all, the Wimpy Kid lovers probably like this one, too. It is an easy summertime movie with some laughs!",1309996800,2,352,4.1911764705882355
4164104,2,B003P3DZDI,"It's always kind of awkward going into a movie you know is based on a book, but you never read the source material since it never interested you. Now there's a movie and a buzz beginning to pick up, but you still don't see the attraction. So if you're forced to see the movie and don't like it, is it because you convinced yourself you weren't going to like it going in or is it because it's just not a good movie? Well an open mind is a good thing, but sometimes things just aren't your cup of tea and you don't like a movie because it's either not good or it's aimed at an audience that you don't fit into. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is shelved somewhere between not being good and being aimed at a younger audience.

The movie begins with an incredibly predictable opening and it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the movie while also giving you an idea of the hell you're about to sit through. In a nutshell, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is about middle school pains; the ups and downs of trying to blend in and be popular while dealing with the outrageous transition from elementary to middle school. As an adult, middle school isn't exactly something you think about regularly. High school? Yes. Middle school? Not so much. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is able to make you feel a little nostalgic about middle school and triggers memories similar to what Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is trying to accomplish. School is obviously going to be the most important part of your life, right? After school activities, being popular, and attaining that class favorite moniker in the yearbook is the only way you'll ever get anywhere in this world.

But a slight wave of nostalgia isn't really enough to make this movie worthwhile. It's incredibly juvenile, which is to be expected. But the humor will more than likely come off as some of the most dense material you've heard in quite some time; sibling rivalry, getting peed on, boogers, hairy moles, and being creeped out by unusual individuals among other things. It really just feels very immature like trying to go back and watch ""Sesame Street"" in your thirties even though you don't have any kids.

I mostly feel like the movie would've been stronger if it was entirely animated. While live-action gives the movie a more realistic and relatable quality, the subject matter felt better suited for animation and the short bits that were animated were easily some of the highlights. Obnoxious children are one of my pet peeves. That is one thing nobody should have to be forced to succumb to ever and this movie is just filled with nothing but that. Rowley (Robert Capron) wasn't, but he was also twice as immature as everyone else around him. Meanwhile Chloe Moretz was a welcome addition to the cast and seemed to be somewhat normal despite being an outcast, but her character was totally pointless. She works for the school newspaper and hangs out underneath bleachers. That's all she does. And all the while we're stuck listening to kids being called ""turd burglars"" and have to learn about the ""cheese touch."" Greg complains several times about the morons around him and it's nothing more than the pot calling the kettle black as Diary of a Wimpy Kid is fairly moronic the majority of the time.

The entire first half of the wrestling scene seemed to be ripped straight from the W.T.F. episode of ""South Park."" They complained about the uniforms, were inspired by ""fake"" wrestling, and the coach even made a speech about REAL wrestling being better than ""fake"" wrestling. In a movie like this, that probably isn't a good thing having a PG-rated movie being compared to a TV-MA show since there's essentially no way one can live up to the other. It was kind of sad more than anything.

The main thing that plagues Diary of a Wimpy Kid is that there doesn't really seem to be any sort of clear message the movie can really offer its audience. Should I ignore advice from my older brother? Not join any after school activity ever? Stand up for my friends? Do the right thing? Dance with my mom? Eat moldy cheese off the ground? Be proud of who I am and not change to fit in? All of these are glossed over, but never really fully developed.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a cluttered family film. It feels like it's dumbed-down to appeal to a younger audience while the humor and storyline is ridiculously childlike and leaves no room for older individuals to jump on board. Its shades of nostalgia and small additions of animation are somewhat charming, but are incapable of saving the film from mostly being an exhaustive effort at entertainment.",1308441600,4,4577,4.589242053789731

4164112,3,B003P3DZDI,"Rating this movie is a difficult thing because I have to keep in mind the target audience and not rate it in terms of my own standards for judging films.

In essence, as you might have suspected, the book is better than the movie (even though I don't necessarily like everything about the books, either).  In fact, movies almost always suffer in comparison to the books on which they're based.  So judged as a kids' movie, I give ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" 3 stars.  It wasn't great, but it did have moments that made my 10 and 11 year old sons laugh.  There was some genuine humor that even an adult could enjoy with his children.  My sons also enjoyed looking at the ways the movie was different than the book.

As a parent who's careful about what my kids watch, I was pleasantly surprised that there were relatively few objectionable things.  Yes, I knew that a certain amount of grossness would accompany the movie (and which I knew would make my boys laugh), but it was actually less than I expected.  There is one scene with a woman in a bikini on a motorcycle magazine that was unnecessary in a movie that had few other things like this and that will mainly be watched by pre-adolescents.

I also wasn't too keen on the portrayal of the parents (especially fathers) who Hollywood often portray as clueless and careless.  While there are bullies like Roderick in real life, in a comedy such bullying seems unnecessary.

The movie ""redeemed"" the main character, Greg, at the end by having him do something nice to ""atone"" for all that he'd done wrong throughout the movie.  However, all of the times he mistreated his best friend, Rowley, were actually sort of painful and not particularly humorous.

There was also a weird tension in the film every time the character Angie Steadman appeared.  She seemed so much more mature than everyone else that this character provides a moral center for the film.  But she was made a peripheral part of the movie, and the scenes with her in it seemed weirdly out of place and humorless.  In spite of this, the actress who played her had a big screen presence, and so, in a way, she stood out in a movie where she really didn't belong.

We watch movies like this mainly to make us laugh, and this movie did this in an average way.",1303430400,10,2270,4.495121951219512
4164113,4,B003P3DZDI,"Greg and his best friend start middle school (6th grade - 8th) where a lot of the boys are much bigger, and the girls they knew in elementary school have taken up new interests, like looking at cute boy butts. Greg will do whatever it takes to become very popular and get into the yearbook, while his friend is still an unselfconscious kid who likes to play and be goofy.

Every avenue to reach his popularity goal ends badly for Greg, creating very funny scenes: wrestling, he is one of the smallest kids and loses to the redhaired creepy boy who is even smaller. Then he cheats to get into a bigger weight class and loses to a snotty, obnoxious girl with braids who has hated him since kindergarten and whose parents sued the school under title 9 to put her in wrestling with the boys. She has a lot of aggression.

Best dressed boy - his buddy doesn't realize Greg is the only one who is supposed to go to school in the shirt and tie and copies Greg.

The school play/musical of the wizard of oz - ms. braids threatens the teacher with trouble from her mom, head of the PTA, to get the lead, and Greg ends up just being a tree, even though he has the best voice. He has the last laugh as the musical is ruined when Greg and the other tree boys have an apple throwing fight on stage. His dad secretly tells him that Dorothy deserved to have apples thrown at her.

All the pursuit of popularity causes Greg to disregard his friend. When his friend finds a new buddy, Greg figures that a new buddy for himself is payback, and tries to make friends with the creepy redhaired boy, who is the strangest child you can imagine. This attempt at a new buddy ends quickly when the creepy boy eats some sugar/candy, goes hyper superweird, and terrorizes Greg for hours with a booger.

Acting as the voice of maturity and sound advice is Chloe Grace Moretz, who plays a 7th grader who writes and takes photos for the school paper when she's not hiding under the bleachers during PE. She keeps popping up throughout the film, and Chloe is a fantastic actress and super cute. (She's also in ""Let Me In"" a 5 star r rated movie with a lot of blood and explicit violence, and she's in ""Kickass"" a 4 star r rated film with some sexual situations and a tremendous amount of very explicit violence, yet funny.)",1299024000,,2292,4.345794392523365

Most of the characters are great, especially Rowley and Roderick.  They're both robust, well written, and steal the scenes they are in.  Steve Zahn is ok as the Dad, but halfway through the movie he turns orange.  Seriously... it's like he overdosed on spray tan.  Very distracting.  I wish they had left out the 'Angie' part, however.  She's a HORRIBLE actress, and she looks like she's about 20.  Her character gave me the creeps and I felt like they were trying WAY too hard to fulfill the role of 'deep' girl.

Their adventures range from going out for wrestling (and being very surprised that it isn't the same as pro-wrestling they watch on TV) to being Safety Officers walking little kids home.

4164158,3,B003P3DZDI,"""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" was directed by Thor Freudenthal (""Hotel for Dogs"") based on the book by Jeff Kinney. Zachary Gordon plays Greg Heffley, a kid entering middle school for the first time with the company of his best friend, Rowley Jefferson played by Robert Capron. Greg becomes obsessed with the idea that he needs to do something notable to get into the ""Class Favorites"" section of the yearbook in order to make his mark and hit the big time, if it weren't for the dorkiness of his best friend holding him back.

Greg has the curse of being a middle child so he is largely ignored by his parents in favor of his younger brother still potty training and his older brother, Rodrick (Devon Bostick) takes great delight in torturing Greg giving him rules he must follow or suffer the consequences. Incidentally, a sequel is already in the works called ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules."" Instead of keeping his head down and getting through these difficulty years, Greg fights the laws of nature in his household becoming a burden to his family and often getting in trouble.

With the situations and the way they are presented, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" feels more like an extended TV show of something like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" instead of a feature film. It has an amusing way of blending in the stick figure illustrations from the book into the story to represent Greg's visualization of the up and down changes in social status he and his friends experience. Greg tries several tactics to get famous in his school that fail fantastically like joining the wrestling team, auditioning for the school play, and joining safety patrol. Many of his problems stem from his own ego which is immature and underdeveloped and often places the blame on his less than cool friend, Rowley instead of turning the focus on himself.

The only times ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" feels like a movie are when Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl from ""Kick Ass"" who plays Angie Steadman enters the scene. She towers over the boys in height and maturity about their current situation. She tries to impart her wisdom on them that none of what happens in middle school really matters in the grand scheme of things and that it is infinitely better to sit back and watch others make fools of themselves for popularity and comment on it in the school newspaper. Greg turns down her invitation to join the paper insisting it would be a conflict of interest since the paper will be too busy reporting on him (which it does...when he makes a fool of himself). Chloe Moretz has an amazing screen presence that is such a pleasure when she is there and the movie noticeably reverts back to that TV style format again when she is gone.

The take on middle school drama, social status concerns, and the influx of made-up rules that can make or break your popularity is very familiar and a good wake-up call to kids that age. For adults, it might be a little familiar or nostalgic but no longer as engaging a problem to relate to. Director Thor Freudenthal's style is very much for kids and young families and in reaching that target demographic, it succeeds. It doesn't quite hit that sweet spot where it can be appealing to kids and adults simultaneously like ""A Christmas Story"" though it tries very hard.

Special Features:

There is full-length commentary by Director Thor Freudenthal and Writer Gabe Sachs where they go into detail about what was and wasn't in the book, what monologue was used to audition for the lead and how they picked Zachary Gordon. The Angie Steadman character played by Chloe Moretz was not in the original source material, but was added because there were all these diverse guy characters and no girls to even it out, like they were an alien species so bringing one into the mix clearly helped the movie.

There are 10 deleted scenes/diary pages consist of many more scenes with the scary ginger kid, Fregley and mostly consist of helpful how-to's and antidotes about the supporting cast characters.",1283817600,10,3988,4.680456490727532

STARRING: Zachary Gordon, Robert Capron, Steve Zahn, Rachael Harris, Devon Bostick, Chloe Mortez, Grayson Russell and Karan Brar

WRITTEN BY: Jackie Filgo, Jeff Filgo, Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah; based on the book by Jeff Kinney

DIRECTED BY: Thor Freudenthal

Rated: PG
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 19 March 2010
Review Date: 25 March 2010

It's probably safe to say that nine out of 10 people, who received public education, had at the very least felt uncomfortable at some point during the process. This is largely what will cause so many to relate to the humor found in the new comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

This film will no doubt become one of those that has created several stars. It's oozing with talented child actors who will make it big in the years to come; primarily it's two lead actors Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron. Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminded me of a PG version of High Fidelity; Gordon as John Cusack and Capron being Jack Black. Several of the actors portraying side characters, have bright futures in acting as well.

The film is based on the popular book that has spawned several sequels, written by Jeff Kinney. Our host is Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) and he wants us to know something: he's about to start his first day of middle school, and wants nothing more than to be popular. Oh, and he wanted this to be a journal, but his mom bought him a diary by mistake.

Being the second shortest kid in school, and having what others consider an outcast for a best friend, Rowley (Robert Capron); Greg has his work cut out for him.

Greg is so caught up with fitting in that he completely neglects, manipulates, and constantly tries to change his best friend Rowley. Despite the fact that it hasn't exactly worked out so well for him thus far, Greg has a textbook idea of what it takes to be popular. We can at least hand it to him that he does want his pal to be popular too.

Like a little Zack Morris in training, Greg has plan after plan to get people to notice and appreciate him. Tormented by his older brother, (Devon Bostick) who promises he will never survive middle school; Greg has to prove him wrong. He tries everything from joining the wrestling team, to signing up for the school's honor program, always dragging Rowley along with him.

Rowley is more than content with who he is and he really steals the show in several scenes. He's a chubby kid, who's a bit of a mamma's boy and doesn't quite understand that kids no longer `play'; as is shown in one funny scene where everyone laughs at him when he asks Greg if he'd care to partake in this once perfectly acceptable activity.

Just like any good movie should, especially one for kids, Diary of a Wimpy Kid has an important moral theme, and man does it go to drastic lengths to get it across. Like a bar of soap after a foul word or two, the themes of integrity and friendship are placed into our mouths, and then sealed shut until the end of the film. The taste sets on our tongue and we have more than learned our lesson by the movie's conclusion; and rightfully so. I just hope that youngsters, who the film is aimed at, will pick up on it, as the ending is rather abrupt with showing our hero learn his lesson. And we learned it without a doubt; but did Greg?

The film could have been a little better I suppose, but it was still better than a lot of comedies I've seen lately, and delivered far more than I expected. Kids will love it and it's a clean film for them to enjoy. As a bonus, adults will laugh quite a bit as well. Still not convinced mom and dad? Did I mention Steve Zahn plays Greg's dad?",1283385600,,3620,4.385074626865672
4164163,5,B003P3DZDI,This movie is a perfect family movie.  It captures the heart of what many kids go through and conveys it with honesty and humor.  Highly recommended.,1283040000,,149,4.6923076923076925
4164164,4,B003P3DZDI,"Now I have not ready the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series, but you don't need to have read it to appreciate the movie.  It is a comedy, of course, that deals with an underdog who keeps a journal (not a diary!) to get himself through the days at middle school.  It is a great movie to watch as we have all been there and survived middle school, this is an especially great movie to show kids that popularity is not the most important thing in the world.  The movie focuses on real friends and it was a lot funnier than I expected!  I think it would be a great family movie to watch!",1282867200,,581,4.026086956521739
4164165,3,B003P3DZDI,"There's always some concern when a popular book is splattered up on the big screen.  This one, though, is a pretty good translation.  I give the movie makers credit for taking a collection of funny and painfully truthful middle school vignettes and turning them into a well made film.  A plot line of Greg wanting to get in the year book under the ""favorites"", thereby solidifying himself as popular, works well and never detracts from what was so good about the book.  I'm sure I'm not the only fan of the original material that kept wondering how the movie might have played out if it was done as a cartoon, using the original drawings that added so much to the book's humor.  I guess we will never know.  Over all, this is well done and definitely worth seeing.  It is good family fun.

4164168,5,B003P3DZDI,"This movie brought me back to middle school times. I'm an adult now. But this movie was highly entertaining. I can still relate to a lot of it, even though I am an adult and I don't have the same situations any more. But this movie makes it easy to remember. Middle school is a simpler time in your life. And this movie paints that picture very well. I don't mean they dumbed it down. This movie was smart with a very good message: ""Never turn on your friends"". What I mean is it shows how kids worry about simpler things in middle school. And they are frequently hilarious, just like the entirety of this movie. Zachary Gordon did an A+ job as Greg. I can't wait to see them all back in the sequel, and the one after that and the one after that! I give this a 10/10!",1280966400,15,767,4.12

We meet Greg Heffley played by Zachary Gordon about to enter middle school. His obnoxious older brother rushes in his room to wake him telling him he is going to be late for his first day of school. Greg races around trying to get ready and then realizes that it is the middle of the night. This sets up the life of Greg.

Greg wants to enter middle school and become a class favorite only to experience ""Murphy's Law"" every time he turns around. His friends embarrass him, he just cannot catch a break! Trying his hand at wrestling and being beat by a girl doesn't help his popularity either.

Things get more complicated as he and his ""embarrassing"" best friend part ways due to him trying to push himself further up the popularity ladder, he realizes that life wasn't really that bad after all.

What I Can Tell You:

  * The story is cute. I love stories based on friendship whether they are kids or adults.
  * The actors are cute but not overly cheesy.
  * The movie is something we can all relate to. Middle school is one of the scariest times of our lives.
  * Secondary character newspaper report Angie should have more screen time.
  * I just had to Facebook ""cheese touch"" last night while watching. So funny!
  * Great movie for kids age, 6-14 and parents will love it as well. Very much like The Wonder Years and Freaks and Geeks.
  * My favorite parts were the comic book drawings included in the movie. Very Cute.
  * In the end, schoolyard dweebes triumph over the cool kids. What's not to like?

Also, they apparently changed Greg, the main character, so that in addition to being wimpy, he has an oversized ego. Hard to find a more annoying combination IMO. If you have kids, they may dig it but no adult should be forced to sit through this horrible excuse for a movie, which stinks more than that ancient piece of moldy cheese out on the playground.",1277942400,11,614,4.54054054054054

4164174,3,B003P3DZDI,"For pure entertainment and a basic feel good message about popularity and real friendship, Diary of a Wimpy Kid delivers.

Most kids are going to eat up the bathroom and booger humor (sorry about the pun). Most will love the problems Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) gets himself into. There were some pretty hysterical and absurd moments that made me laugh out loud. Lots and lots of physical humor and lots and lots of bad ideas. Greg eventually learns some important lessons like real friends trump popularity and popularity isn't everything especially if it costs your self-respect and good friends. However, Greg does a little bit of damage while getting to the lessons.

Parents may want to consider that this movie contains a few subtle negative messages. First, there are the parental units who are generally clueless. Now, for most older kids to teens this is a real fantasy -- who doesn't want to do what they want to do when they want to do it? Who wants rules and parents sticking their noses in and redirecting or handing out consequences? The more parents are portrayed that way, though, I wonder if kids begin to chafe even more against their own parents who might not be so easy going or easily fooled. I know most kids do know movies from reality. But the more that stereotype is tossed out there the more I wonder if that's not part of the ""but everyone's doing it, Mom."" mentality.

The older brother, Roderick, is a completely mean-spirited jerk. And in some of Greg's dealings with the world it almost feels like he has picked up some lessons from Roderick. The leading female within Greg's class is so annoying I wonder how she could be popular, oh, yes, it's because she threatens everyone. Some of the light-hearted fun is hobbled because of these characters and their excessive meanness. Some remarks made my two friends flinch. Roderick has a biker babe magazine under his bed and it appears in a few scenes. His mother confronts him about the disrespect he's shown all womankind while his friends laugh during the confrontation.

Aside from the parental warnings, it's-a-laugh-a-scene movie that most older kids will enjoy.",1271721600,49,2147,4.8419618528610355
