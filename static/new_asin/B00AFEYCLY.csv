5423500,5,B00AFEYCLY,"Get this before 2nd season it fills in a few questions that come up in the 2nd season, besides that just as funny as the other parts worth getting.",1362614400,,147,4.103448275862069
5423501,3,B00AFEYCLY,You guys should wait for the whole series combo with this OVA included . would be alot cheaper and worth it,1361923200,,107,4.142857142857143
5423502,5,B00AFEYCLY,Well this is my favorite anime so I will be buying this when I get paid. $20 is a bit steep for 2 episodes when you consider we get 13 for $42 (on rightstuf). However if your a big fan of the series it will be worth it. Season 1 came with some OVA's but they are all subbed. I would gladly pay $40 to get them dubbed (^_^),1359936000,,322,3.681159420289855
5423503,5,B00AFEYCLY,"I really do enjoy this series, the voice overs are pretty top notch with some of my favs. in there and the humor is rather exceptional in my opinion.",1357430400,,149,4.172413793103448
5423504,5,B00AFEYCLY,"I admit, I'm not all too happy to see that unlike some other FUNi releases (Darker Than Black 2, Black Butler 2) that they decided to split the Season 2 box set and OVAs into separate sets (which they do sometimes). But, I'd be a big liar if I said that would stop me from purchasing this as well.

This OVA set includes the two OVAs from Baka and Test (Day 1: Me, Maids, and a New Start; Day 2: Idiots, Fireworks, and the Summoning Tournament) and it also has some special features included. The OVAs are just slightly longer than a regular episode of the show.

These OVAs were plenty funny and set up certain characters and events that appear in the second season of the show, but it seems like too much to pay for just these two OVAs and a couple of special features that just could have been packaged with the second season of the show.

As a big fan of the series, I'd be Baka to NOT buy it! But, whether or not that it is worth the price is more up to you. I mean, it is a little costly if you aren't really that much of a fan (after all, it is near the price of some whole series sets for some older Anime titles), but I'm sure if you really like the series, that this set should also be worth the plunge.",1356134400,15,1213,4.045833333333333
5423505,5,B00AFEYCLY,"I loved it! It was great. I was a bit sceptacle when I first bought it, I don't normally buy OVAs due to how short they are, but this one was worth it. The back of the box for some reason says its 22 minutes long, but that's not the case. It is about an 1hrs worth long so the price is about right.",1411689600,,298,3.671875
5423506,5,B00AFEYCLY,"This series is fantastic, one of my all time favorites a must have for any anime fan. I am sure you will love it as well.",1399680000,,121,3.6923076923076925
5423507,5,B00AFEYCLY,"This OVA set takes place in between the first and second seasons of Baka & Test. The show is hilariously funny and should be watched by any anime fans who can handle a little perverted humor. While this set is only about an hour an a half long, when you think about it, you are paying about the same for what would be a movie of similar length so the price shouldn't be an issue for anybody. Definitely pick this up along with the first season and you will enjoy hours of continuous laughter that will make your sides hurt!",1398643200,,523,4.24
5423508,3,B00AFEYCLY,"The OVA episodes are a lot of fun...but there are only two of them! So for the amount you pay, it was a little bit of a letdown to only get two episodes. However, they are entertaining, and if you want to complete your baka and test collection, it's nice to have!",1393891200,,263,4.076923076923077
5423509,5,B00AFEYCLY,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5423510,5,B00AFEYCLY,"This is one of my favorite anime, it produces great humor.

Both the English and Japanese audio have excellent voice acting.

The theme is a bit more mature, but I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends who are also into anime.",1379203200,,241,4.454545454545454
5423511,4,B00AFEYCLY,Baka and test is one of those great dubs a small treasure with good laughs and the OVA has quite a few as well would recommend to any anime fan!,1375056000,,144,3.8333333333333335
5423512,5,B00AFEYCLY,I wish there was a few more episodes for a better setup but for it being two episodes its ok.,1373500800,,93,3.7
5423513,5,B00AFEYCLY,"This is really great because in season two the events of this ova are mentioned, but they never explain what happened. This ova gives an insight into what happened. The storyline is very funny and the dub is great! I would recommend this to anyone who has seen the two seasons of Baka & Test or people who just like to laugh.",1371168000,,325,4.258064516129032
5423514,5,B00AFEYCLY,I really enjoyed the series.  It was everything I expected.  The OVA is completely worth the money I paid.  Seriously,1369526400,,117,4.75
5423515,5,B00AFEYCLY,I really wanted it on DVD only but I had to buy it on blue ray/DVD but it was made before the season 2,1367712000,,102,3.2916666666666665
5423516,5,B00AFEYCLY,"Great OVA's.  Both the boys duel and try to save the day for their women and friends.  The losers of the class one ups upperclassmen.  Way more shenanigans compared to the rest of Season 1, but it doesn't stray from original storyline.  More cross dressing is prominent and the split ending was kinda weird, but sort of ties in for more realism.",1367280000,,345,4.516129032258065
5423517,4,B00AFEYCLY,"The new bit: worth it if you're looking for ""all things Baka & Test"", but a bit pricey for a single episode.
Well, I guess a classroom full of mostly delinquents and underachievers *could* qualify as ""beasts"". This is a pretty standard romantic comedy (harem) that would be average if not for the interesting setting. A school pilot program where students classes can challenge other classes to attempt to improve their school equipment. The best scoring students get the best equipment, the worst get junk. The challenges are done by holographic ""champions"" or avatars based on the individuals grade in the subject of the teacher monitoring the challenge. So some strategy in choosing the right time, place and teacher are needed. It is overall a pretty good series (both seasons and the OVA) but not the most original characters. The comedy is better than a lot (to my liking anyway). I won't go into anything to spoil the series. I think it was worth getting and consider it a ""keeper"". Take that for what it is worth.",1366934400,,1021,4.7740112994350286
5423518,5,B00AFEYCLY,If you liked season one you'll like this OVA (original video animation) that sort of lands you between season one and season two. Though short ( it is an  OVA after all ) still packed with loads of fun stuff and loads of comedy from all your favorite characters in the show. ^_^,1366761600,,278,4.245283018867925
5423519,5,B00AFEYCLY,If u love baka (idiots) you need to see this one and it a great deal look amazing so git ready of the best anime on Amazon,1366588800,,122,3.5555555555555554
5423520,5,B00AFEYCLY,This series makes me laugh. I watched the seasons on Hulu and bought this ova because I wanted more. I wasn't let down. The colors are really bright on blu ray and you can tell they put a lot of effort into the art. Great show and a good buy,1366416000,,241,3.84
5423521,2,B00AFEYCLY,One word: disappointing. This OVA special definitely has some hilarious moments but overall I would have preferred to see them work on Season 3 as opposed to a special with just 2 twenty minute episodes.  Overall just a let down.,1365724800,,229,4.725
5423522,4,B00AFEYCLY,"""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts"" is back and this time, the F class must take part in a festival and find out what kind of event they can do.  Meanwhile, the Class F would like to have real furniture in their class instead of cardboard mats and boxes.

But what happens when Akihisa Yoshii finds out that if they don't succeed in the festival, Mizuki Himeji may have to go to another school.  Meanwhile, there are people from other classes who are determined in making sure the F class does not succeed at the festival.

Does Class F have a chance of succeeding?  Find out in ""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection""!

What is ""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts""?

In 2007, ""Baka to Test to Shokanju"" (Baka and Test) was created by Kenji Inoue. Featured as a light novel series and featuring the illustrations by Yui Haga, a total of 12 volumes have been printed thus far and a manga adaptation by Mosuke Mattaku began in 2009 in the magazine ""Shonen Ace"" and also on ""Famitsu Comic Clear"".

An anime adaptation began in 2010 and a second season which aired in Japan in July 2011. And with the first and second season released in America on Blu-ray/DVD courtesy of FUNimation, the two-episode OVA collection will be released in February 2013.

The anime series features animation production from Silver Link and the previous staff from the first season which includes director Shin Oonuma (""Mahou Sensei Negima!"", ""Pani Poni Dash!""), screenplay by Katsuhiko Takayama (""Cat Planet Cuties"", ""ef: a tale of melodies"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""Ga-Rei-Zero""), music by Nijine (""Akikan"", ""Hatsukoi Limited"", ""Idolm@ster: Xenoglossia""), character designs by Miwa Oshima (""Hit o Nerae!"", Rakugo Tennyo Oyui!"") and art direction from Kohji Azuma (""Natsu no Arashi!"", ""Tokyo Requiem"", ""Arakawa Under the Bridge"").

""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts"" revolves around a not-so-smart teenager named Akihisa Yoshii. Because he is not so smart, he is constantly called ""Baka"" (in Japanese which means stupid). Akihisa is also living on a very tight budget and because he doesn't have much money, he often has to cut his ramen noodles in pieces and eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Akihisa goes to Fumizuki Academy where staff separate their students based on their test scores. The better the grade, the better their life will be in school. For example: ""A"" students have great furniture and desks and luxurious studying areas, while those with F's have regular classrooms but have crates or cardboard boxes as desks.

But there is a way that lower grades students can get things from higher grade students and that is to challenge them in a battle for facilities.

How this works out is that a student can call forth their ""Shokanju"" or Avatar and during the battle, a teacher supervises the battle. While students compete in various subjects, avatars can lose HP when struck by an opponent and when their point count reaches zero, they are disqualified. But a student can leave the battle before reaching a zero, take a supplemental exam and return back into battle.

For Akihisa, his first day at Fumizuki Academy is to take a placement test. Its pretty much a given that Akihisa will be in the lowest class but when the intelligent student Mizuki Himeji is sick as is unable to complete her test, unfortunately she is given a zero and must join Akihisa and other delinquents in class F. The other delinquents include their class rep Yuji Sakamoto, the oftenly mistaken for a girl Hideyoshi Kinoshita, the perverted Tsuchiya Kouta and the tomboy Minami Shimada. Interesting enough, both Mizuki and Minami have a crush on Akihisa.

But because Class F has the intelligent Mizuki (who should be an A student), it gives them an edge in battle. Also, despite students being in F class, they may not be good in certain subjects but some may be great in one.

In ""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"", because Class F holds their class in a classroom without furniture, they are given the opportunity to have furniture if they do well for the upcoming festival.

But after a bout with sabotage from people who have grudges against Class F, the school gives Class F another chance to get new furniture if they are involved in another class battle.  Meanwhile, Akihisa finds out that if the class doesn't do well in the festival or the battle, Mizuki may need to go to another school.

Determined in trying to keep Mizuki at school, Akihisa will do all he can to make sure their team wins.

VIDEO:

""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"" is presented in 1080p High Definition. I actually like the look of the series and the concentration of really elaborate artistic backgrounds. A very colorful series with good pastels, also use of poka dots on backgrounds and foregrounds. And also there is quite a bit more detail for the two OVA episodes compared to the TV series.  The OVA episodes have a hint of softness but picture quality for the OVA's are quite vibrant and colorful.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. First, the good news is the voice acting for soundtracks are very well done. I watched the series in both soundtracks and typically I am biased to the Japanese soundtrack but for this series, both are well done!  Second, because the English soundtrack is presented in lossless 5.1, there is a bit of better dynamic range for the English dub but for the most part, the OVA series is not too immersive as I would have hoped.  But for the most part, both soundtracks are good and well-acted.

Subtitles are only in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"" comes with the following special features:

  OVA 1 Split: Hideyoshi Kinoshita, Mizuki Himeji and Minami Shimada - (10:52) Repeating of a certain scene from the first OVA.
  OVA 2 Split: Ending - (4:01)  A repeat from the second OVA ending.
  Promotional Videos - (4:20) Japanese promotional videos with English subtitles.
  Original Commercials - (:33) The original Japanese CM's.
  Textless Opening Song: ""Renai Koujo Committee""
  Textless Closing Song: ""Getsuyou wa Kirai""

EXTRAS:

""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"" comes with the Blu-ray and the DVD version of the OVA series.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For ""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts"" fans, the return of the characters for two additional OVA episodes will no doubt entertain you, the problem is that the series is limited to two OVA's.  So, it's quite short.

But for those wanting more episodes, what you get with ""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection"" are two episodes that feature Class F in another major challenge.  While season one of the series focused on the class battle, season two of the TV series focused on love triangles and relationships.  So, it was nice to see Class F get into battle once again for the OVA series and take on new rivals, but also to see the group once again in crazy competitions.

Needless to say, ""Baka and Test"" is a fun, wild and entertaining series.  There is a good balance of the RPG-like battles, humor and of course, fan service.  If anything, the series strikes a fine balance in showcasing characters that will appeal to both the guys and girls.  You have a taste of harem with the girls falling for Akihisa, you have the fan service as we often see Mizuki's boobs bouncing, the pervertedness with Kota always trying to take pictures of girls in their panties,  you have a yaoi/yuri situations, you have Minami and her tsundere style and more!

But with OVA collections, you tend to think there will be possibly anywhere between six or even ten OVA's, but in this case, there are only two, which could have been added to the season two Blu-rays.

There is nothing groundbreaking with this OVA series but yet, it does maintain the crazy and hilarious atmosphere that the series is known for.

And as for the animation and character designs, as mentioned earlier, I felt that SILVER LINK, a newer company did a great job. Especially since they are not a major studio and their talent are focusing on several series at one time, SILVER LINK had more time to dedicate to the overall look of the series. From the detailed and artistic backgrounds to the character designs, for the OVA's ""Baka and Test"" looks pretty good on Blu-ray but picture quality does have a little softness but the series is quite colorful and vibrant.

Overall, ""Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - OVA Special Collection is a fun and enjoyable OVA series, the problem is that with two episodes, for an OVA collection, it's quite short.  Otherwise, I do recommend the OVA's if you love the series and have watched and owned both seasons on Blu-ray.",1364601600,2,8827,4.782981530343008

8550896,4,B00AFEYCLY,"This is a great blu-ray set for a great show. Baka & Test were one of the Anime ""gems"" that's hard to forget, and with this release, Funimation has given us the whole library. The price may be a tad steep (20 dollars for two episodes...), but the set goes for 50$ in Japan, so it isn't that bad.

The content itself is great. Unlike season one, this one was made in HD. The Audio and Video are considerably better and the animation is a bit more lively than the TV-series. They didn't save anything on this one and went all out on the budget. The extras are great as usual, there's a bunch of bonus content in form of bonus episodes, as was the case with season 1 and 2. There's not much more to say.

If you're less smart than the avarage man, you'll feel right at home here. If you aren't, you will laugh of all the anticts and stupidity these characters are up to. Maybe cringe as well. Point is: BUY IT NOW!",1422230400,,911,4.141242937853107
