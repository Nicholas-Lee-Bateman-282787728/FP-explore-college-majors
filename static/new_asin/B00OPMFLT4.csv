6758669,5,B00OPMFLT4,This show hasn't missed a beat! !! I hope we have 6 more seasons to laugh with /at !!!!!!! It's still amazing,1442102400,,109,4.0
6758670,1,B00OPMFLT4,"I love this season of Modern Family. Thought this was more entertaining and funnier than Season 5 which lacked that originality and smart humor. But why has Fox stopped releasing Modern Family on Blu Ray. So I have the first 4 seasons on Blu but now I'll never get to have 5, 6 or the future seasons cause i refuse to pick up the DVDs after the universal crap reviews season 5 DVD got. Shame on you Fox.

Also, the star rating is for the release, not the season itself. The season is 5 stars for me",1441584000,15,498,4.134020618556701
6758671,5,B00OPMFLT4,"Despite being on for six seasons, Modern Family is still consistently laugh-out-loud funny, following the lives of the Pritchetts and Dunphys.

The 24-episode season features overachieving Alex's (Ariel Winter) senior year of high school, following her struggles to graduate top of her class and find the perfect Ivy League college. However, as she painfully begins to learn, it's not always possible to be number one.

Meanwhile, Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Claire (Julie Bowen) keep overcoming challenges in running the family business together, while Haley (Sarah Hyland) works for a demanding and demeaning fashion editor and Luke (Nolan Gould) begins distancing himself from his father (Ty Burrell) after years of being more like buddies than father-son.

No matter what the clan does, it's bound to keep you laughing! Season 7 is sure to keep up the tradition.",1433462400,11,859,5.301470588235294
6758672,4,B00OPMFLT4,"Season Six isn't quite finished yet, so I can't rate the product, but I can rate the show.
Modern Family has always been smart and it's always been quite funny, utilizing situations and scenarios most people who've been in a big, mixed family will find familiar, though sadly, it seems to have lost its touch since the first two seasons, which nothing they do can seem to top. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, each of the characters still play off of one another very well with all of their idiosyncrasies, neurotic behavoirs, and cluelessness, and there's still plenty of sight gags, play on words, puns, and absurdly funny situations, but that doesn't change the constant feeling that something is sort of missing, for lack of a better word.",1432080000,8,746,4.790697674418604

6758784,4,B00OPMFLT4,"The show itself continues to be very funny, well acted and cleverly written. One of the main themes this year is Alex finishing high school and getting ready for and trying to choose a college. As other reviewers have pointed out, the show runners seem to want to totally overdo the Alex is a nerd who does not care about her appearance, and dresses her like a lumberjack with the most awful glasses they could find. The younger characters, if the show is going to continue on much longer, are going to have to develop beyond what they are to keep the show fresh. And given that Ariel Winter is so very not a flannel wearing tomboy, allowing her character to move beyond that now is one way the show can do that. While there is some of that with the adult characters, they are definitely more set, and aside from introducing new situations for them to be in (such as Claire and the internet episode) or robot Phil in the season finale, there is not nearly as much room for character development among them as there will be as the younger actors continue to age.

One of the great additions to the cast as recurring characters were the Dunphy's new neighbors, the LaFontaine family, played by Steve Zahn and Andrea Anders. Zahn as a distributor of medical marijuana is hilarious, and having them as sometimes friends and sometimes enemies of Claire and Phil on a limited basis is great. The story lines for the rest of the cast really continues to be more of the same. While each family gets some focus, and there are call backs to prior seasons episodes and story lines. The Hailey/Andy story line that was introduced in the 5th season continues this season (especially toward the end) and we get to see that Beth (played by Laura Ashley Samuels) is actually real, and their story leads into kind of a cliff hanger at the end of the season.

The DVD release this season is better than the season 5 release, but it is still horrible that the show (especially as popular as it continues to be, even if there has been a decline in popularity) that it does not continue to be available on blu ray as it was during the first 4 seasons. There are not a ton of extras, a few behind the scenes and making of features on some of the episodes, including the internet episode (which was almost entirely shot on iphones, a few deleted scenes, and a gag reel. Good for what is there, but not as much as in prior seasons. There are no commentary tracks on any episode this year. If the extras are not a huge deal for you, then streaming it will get you the same audio and video quality as the DVDs will.",1448755200,2,2589,4.402922755741128

6758804,5,B00OPMFLT4,"This whimsical story of the lives of the Pritchard family still hasn't lost steam after several seasons. MODERN FAMILY keeps going on and on and we can't get enough of this blended family and their silly but loving antics.
Jay Pritchard (Ed O'Neill) is married to Colombian bombshell Gloria (Sofia Vergara). They live with their infant  and her son Manny (Rico Rodriguez) from a previous marriage.  Jay's daughter Claire Dunphy (Julie Bowen) who is  married to the lovable but wacky realtor husband Phil (Ty Burrell) had three children and has the ""traditional"" marriage. Add in Jay's gay son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his husband Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and their adopted Vietnamese daughter Lilly and you have the modern family.
It's amazing how the writers continue to keep MODERN FAMILY  fresh and lively after so many seasons...although binge watching several episodes in one evening can create a mind haze in the viewer. Guest stars like Nathan Lane and Tyne Daly add to the fun and the quirky take on modern life can be hilarious. A mini drone with camera continually flies over Gloria as she sunbathes. Phil will figure out a solution to save Gloria, Of course, who can get enough of gorgeous Sofia Vergara and her delightful accent?
There are several highlights in Season 6 but my favorite episode hands down features Claire on her laptop at an airport trying to text and Facetime her family. The results are priceless and a fine job is done in maneuvering this technical maze. Of course, a misunderstanding over Haley's Facebook status causes chaos.
MODERN FAMILY continues to delight. I can't get enough of gorgeous Gloria and wacky Phil (goofy, but totally the loving dad and family man we all wish we had in our lives). This show continues to be a winner on all levels.",1444694400,,1795,4.894736842105263

The picture quality is as one would expect and there were no blurriness issues experienced while watching this one.  It would appear that whatever the problem was in the authoring of the Season 5 DVDs has been rectified this time around.  4 stars given for the season of television itself.  not the funniest season of the show, but still pretty good...",1444089600,,540,4.424242424242424

6758812,5,B00OPMFLT4,"The streak is over. After winning Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series its first five seasons, which tied Frasier for top honors in that category, Modern Family: Season 6 fell short. But it had nothing to do with the quality of episodes. This series remains one of the funniest sitcoms on television, and Season 6 has no shortage of laugh-out-loud moments.

The success formula for Modern Family is pretty simple:  Clever writing, rapid-fire jokes, likable characters, a talented ensemble cast, reality-show cutaway remarks, and comedy thats truly situation-based, rooted in emotions and scenarios that audiences can often identify with.

What makes this family modern is that it includes non-traditional models that are common today. The gruff businessman patriarch of the Pritchett clan (Ed ONeill) has remarried a Colombian hottie (Sofa Vergara) 20 years his junior who has a son named Manny (Rico Rodriguez), whom Jay tries to toughen up. Jays two children are Claire, an OCD who married a doofus (Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphy, the self-proclaimed fun dad) that Jay couldn't stand, and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), his gay son now married to the flamboyant Cam (Eric Stonestreet). Mitchell and Cam have adopted a Vietnamese orphan named Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons), while Claire and Phil have three biological children: the flirtatious and carefree Haley (Sarah Hyland), the studious Alex (Ariel Winter), and not-too-bright Luke (Nolan Gould).

That core group collectively has 27 Outstanding Supporting Actor/Actress nominations and six Primetime Emmy wins. There isn't a weak link among them. In all cases, the actors and writers manage to create characters that are totally believable, both individually and in relation to the others. You accept them as couples, in-laws, steps, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters. There are also degrees of exaggeration that help to create the comedy, but without ever edging too close to the kind of over-the-top humor that too many sitcoms depend upon. And theres no annoying laugh track to prod viewers.

This season new neighbors feud with Claire and Phil, Cam and Mitchell think about adding another child to their family, and Jay seems to be growing more sensitive about his age. Hes also worried his young son Joe is playing with too many girlie things, and it doesnt exactly help his psyche to pretend to be gay in order to fill in for one of the bowlers on Cams team. Haley tries to get Alex to loosen up a bit this season, and the writers attempt a clever (some might say gimmicky) episode thats told entirely from Claires laptop as shes stranded at the airport. Despite the non-standard narrative format, they still manage laughs, and thats saying something. Apart from an episode in which little Joe might be allergic to Jays beloved dog (shades of a Brady Bunch episode), what elevates this show is the originality of the plots from week to week . . . and the way those plots still incorporate ways to connect with viewers. In one Season 6 episode Jay takes a pottery class in order to make a clay bunny for his Bunny for their anniversary, but Gloria treats it like a piata, wondering what he put inside. Anyone whos ever made or received a personally crafted gift can identify with Jay, and common elements pop up in just about every episode.

Like most good sitcoms, Modern Family is addictive. Buy this season and youll probably feel the impulse to pick up the earlier ones. Its that funny. Twenty-four episodes are included on three single-sided discs and housed in a standard-size keep case, with plastic pages to keep the discs from getting scratched.",1443312000,3,3628,5.02828618968386
6758813,5,B00OPMFLT4,"Modern Family: The Complete Sixth Season is a 3-DVD set containing all 24 episodes of the 2014-2015 season. This show has maintained its quality during its entire run, without ever falling into a rut  the bane of many sitcoms. The reason lies in the sharp writing and the shows exceptional cast. The premise of a large extended, blended family interacting in each others lives has offered endless possibilities for humor.

In Season 6, newly wedded Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) accustom themselves to the realities of married life, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) find their marriage stressed by annoying new neighbors, a Thanksgiving dinner goes awry, and Claires online shopping. Meanwhile, a spy-camera drone wrecks havoc in Jay (Ed ONeill) and Glorias (Sofia Vergara) backyard and a close call on the highway leads to amusing changes in various members of the Pritchett-Dunphy clan.

The series has received several awards, including five Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series; four Emmys for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (two for Eric Stonestreet, two for Ty Burrell); two Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Emmys for Julie Bowen; and a Golden Globe for Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy. The show was conceived by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan while sharing stories of their own modern families.
