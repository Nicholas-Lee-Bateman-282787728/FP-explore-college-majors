It's a really interesting [nostalgic] trip back to the heyday of the Salton Sea. It is quite detailed in its approach & very nicely done.",1312243200,6,245,4.3478260869565215

8350106,5,B0023W65ES,"A wonderful window into the excitement and anticipation of the riviera that was never quite meant to be.  The commentator in the 1968 film ""Miracle In The Desert"" prophetically notes, ""this unusual city has a date with destiny.""  Boy, does it ever.  He just had no idea what *kind* of destiny would bring destruction eight short years later.

I highly recommend this taste of what soon-to-be-broken dreams were made of, and endless fantasies of what it could have been had it been planned with as much *research* as it was money.",1492992000,,529,4.78021978021978

8350109,5,B0023W65ES,"Excellent 60's campy films about the ""California Riviera"" and the endless optimism for its future. World-class golfing and water skiing in this beautiful oasis in the desert! A must-see for anyone interested in the history of The Salton Sea.",1447113600,3,241,5.205128205128205
8350110,5,B0023W65ES,"Outstanding video highlighting the history of the Salton Sea from its formation to its heydays to today's sad state. Also, a must-see is ""Plagues snd Pleasures at the Salton Sea"" from the same team at Tilapia Films.",1433289600,2,215,4.837837837837838

8350113,5,B0023W65ES,"Love all the photos and history on the Salton Sea. Makes me what to time warp back to its hey-day. It also exemplifies the complete and utter failure of our government to do anything in a timely matter to save it! How about cleaning it up, having a gambling zone around it and watch it flourish.....our version of Las Vegas!",1370044800,6,324,4.416666666666667
8350114,2,B0023W65ES,"I enjoy historic documentaries of places that have been lost to time and nature.  The details of their heydays and history should be at least a little educational.  This was nothing but the film of old advertising, some home movies (set to a soundtrack) and a musical slideshow.  I've seen at least one other documentary on the Salton Sea that did not insult one's intelligence.  I recommend everyone save their money, this wasn't worth the price.",1330214400,4,447,4.842105263157895
