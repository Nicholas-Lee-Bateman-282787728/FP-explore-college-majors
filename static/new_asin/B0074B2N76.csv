5053894,5,B0074B2N76,"All I can say is - WOW. This blu-ray blows all other versions of these two cult classics out of the water. Wizard is probably my favorite Lewis movie. It's so ""out there"" that you won't believe it exists. The HD presentation is as clear as a bell and surpassed all my expectations. At this low price, it almost seems like they're giving it away. Come on that's $4.50 a movie. Buy it. Buy two and give one away to your mother-in-law for Christmas!",1373673600,9,446,4.321428571428571

5053897,5,B0074B2N76,"I've been a fan of both these films for years and owened them on multiple formats and can honestly say both films have never looked better, as a matter of fact these films shouldn't look this good considering the time period and budget they were filmed for. both still have minimal print damage and cigaret burns, but does not detract from the enjoyment of the films, just gives it that grindhouse feel. both have great commentarys and a H.G. Lewis trailer gallery and poster gallery. getting both these films for under $10 is a steal, highestpossible recomendation. you can throw away your dvd's now.",1344124800,10,601,4.788461538461538
5053898,3,B0074B2N76,"Fans of the classic drive in genre can rejoice knowing that Image has made the effort to release the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis on blu-ray. That's not to say the movies are spectacular in any way, but fans of H.G. and the films he made will be dancing in the street knowing they're now available in high format quality. Which seems odd since the movies were released on about as low a quality budget as was possible. In any event, the movies are a part of movie history, though at the bottom end.

The first film, WIZARD OF GORE, is the lesser of the two if that's possible. Montag it Magnificent is a magician who performs the standard tricks until the finale of his show. At that time he pulls out all stops and taunts the audience to decide if what they are about to see is real or merely an illusion. His first finale is to saw a woman in half. But this isn't the usual fare. Instead, he does so without placing her in a box but has her entire body in view. Pulling out a chainsaw, he proceeds to saw her open, guts and blood spewing forth in great profusion. Moments later the stunned audience watches on as the girl rises from the table, unharmed. The only problem is that later that night she goes to a restaurant and before she can order she's found on the floor saw in half.

A local talk show host having seen the show the night before with her boyfriend sportswriter sees the body being carted off and it accidentally touches her hand. The next day when she tries to get Montag on her show he declines until the bloodstain appears on her hand, a stain that only he can see. He invites her back that night and she goes this time to witness another grizzly scene, a woman with a spike driven into her skull. She too walks away unharmed only to be found later dead of the same injury seen onstage.

Just who Montag really is and how he's completing these gruesome murders would be the normal movie one would expect to see. Instead we get all sorts of goofy speeches from Montag about illusion and reality and a twist ending that would have seemed half smart had the rest of the film not been so bad. Worst of all is Montag himself, played by . When the term ham actor comes to mind from here on out this is the actor I'll see in my mind's eye. Couple that with some tremendously bad make up that has his hair changing color from white to brown and eyebrows that look like they've had shoe polish brushed over them and you have one really bad movie.

THE GORE GORE GIRLS is the better of the two films. Had this story been done with a bigger budget, better actors and a better script it could have been an A picture. The idea is quite good, it's just the execution that's lacking.

The dancers at the local strip club are being killed off in gory fashion. Heads opened, eyes gouged and more should be a reason to chase people off from visiting the joint but they continue to come to watch the go go girls dance away. The local newspaper hires top private eye  to investigate paying him top dollar to do so if he'll give them the scoop. He takes the job and the money and begins tracking down the killer.

Following a trail of clues and suspects he frequents the club where the girls work. This gives viewers plenty of time to see the main reason folks went to see this movie, semi-clad women shaking everything they had with the limited restrictions of the time. For those who don't understand that means pasties and panties are the wardrobe of choice.

Between sleuthing and dancing we witness the killer strike again and again in even more blood and guts scenes than Lewis has done in the past. It was the thing that brought people to see his movies and he delivers the goods.

As I said, this movie at least has a plot that you can follow and that makes sense. It was done, as were most of Lewis' films, on a budget set just below shoestring but the heart and soul that he put into his films is seen on display on screen.

H. G. Lewis may not be a familiar name to the majority of people. He probable will never be honored with an Oscar. But he was a pioneer of the times and did create a genre, the gore film, which has been copied and replicated over and over again. The biggest difference between his films and those being made today (other than budget) was that he was at least attempting to make something different, to offer a story that the gore became a part of rather than the center of.

Movie lovers who remember the days of the drive in will want to pick this one up. It may not be the best that was offered in that locale, but it is something memorable.",1336953600,6,4581,4.266129032258065

8509717,4,B0074B2N76,"DVD Review: Pretty much the greatest thing about this Blu-Ray is that both movies are in 1:78 ration aspect. Or 1:77. Whatever. The picture quality may not be up everyone's a$$ but I hate HD so I was happy about it, thus, don't care what you think.

Movie review: Wizard Of Gore was a weird movie. It made absolutely no sense what so ever. But it was gory. Gore Gore Girls is a wonderful movie filled with ugly broads showing their boobs. Then they get mangled in a hilarious way. Butt tenderizer!!!!

In Conclusion: 4 stars for the Blu-ray, 3 1/2 for Wizard Of Gore and 4 stars for Gore Gore Girls.",1423526400,,599,4.339285714285714

8509720,2,B0074B2N76,"Obviously, you have to be a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis' work to appreciate these movies.

Honestly, I didn't know what to expect when I started to watch this double feature.  Let's just say I was surprised but not impressed.  The nicest thing I can say after viewing each movie is that they are definitely curio pieces from a bygone era rather than anything exceptional in the field of horror.  The transfer quality of both is marginal (the sound features hissing, the film is marred with lines and various other anomalies that streak across the screen from time to time).  The stories in both movies are weak; they both follow the same formula of instantly forgettable scenes followed by a killing, another unremarkable scene, a killing, et cetera.  The acting is consistently bad; all the characters/actors have a tendency to yell their lines and gesture awkwardly.  The dialog is inane.  In the first movie, the magician Montag spends most of his screen time pontificating in a pompous manner, to the point that he repeats his dialog several times (and it wasn't of interest the first time he said it).  At no point is either of these movies horrifying.  The gore might have been impressive 44 years ago but today it just looks like the animal guts they originally used (sheep to be exact).  As an example of early ""splatter"" flicks they might be of some interest.  As entertainment, they are sorely lacking.  I was uniformly unimpressed with both, but at least The Gore Gore Girls had an appearance by Henny Youngman to up the novelty aspect.  (This film is still banned in Australia, although one wonders why, unless boring tripe is a crime there.)  Quite honestly, neither is gory enough to deserve the title of a ""gore"" flick.  There's just way too much yapping and not enough payoff to justify sitting through both.  I kept watching the clock thinking surely they must be over soon.  This was a long-long-long 175 minutes that I can't get back.

They were interesting to watch once, to satisfy my curiosity, but nothing I'd care to keep to watch again.",1403913600,,2063,4.76056338028169
8509721,5,B0074B2N76,"After purchasing The Blood Trilogy, I saw this at Fry's a few months later.  The Wizard of Gore & the Gore Gore Girls.  Both of these films by Herschell Gordon Lewis are better & cheesier than the Blood trilogy.  And I might add that in the case of the Gore Gore Girls, that the funny facter is amped up, and that it is a real joy to watch.  Especially with the late, great Henny Youngman, King of The One Liners (Take My Wife Please!!!) makes a brief Cameo Appearence.  I Love the Campiness of the Gore Gore Girls!  And let's face it, I can't help the chinzyness (and the acid trip) of ""The Wizard of Gore).
  Do yourself a favor, get this double feature blu-ray",1396915200,3,663,4.248
8509722,4,B0074B2N76,"See my review for the blood trilogy...much the same thing except with region A theres no getting out of it, unless your multi-regioned or burn. Chow Chow for Now Now.",1396137600,,166,4.566666666666666
8509723,3,B0074B2N76,"I didn't pay any attention to the distributor before buying these. When I slide the dvd in my machine and up popped ""Something Weird Video"" I thought, 'Oh no!' But as bad as some of my prior experience with SWV has been these weren't terrible!

These are decent transfers. There are still the ocassional streaks and such.
As for the content; both use buckets of guts either shown in close-up while in a container or piled on the actor. (Puking guts??Really!?)

The Wizard of Gore has Judy Cler doing the only good acting. That's beside the fact she's beautiful. The magician is one of those people you don't want to talk to, because they always talk as if they are on stage with no microphone. The effects are poor even for 1970. Other than the gore and stiff acting there is no real violence, no sex, no nudity, and no language abuse here.

The Gore Gore Girls has the same HG Lewis gore, but this one is centered around strip clubs. The great Henny Youngman plays the owner of a chain of clubs and speaks in one liners he's famous for. I actually felt this movie was not only watchable, but I will eventually re-watch it! And not because of all the nudity. This was done with a sly tongue-in-cheek which helped. There is plenty of nudity, but no sex. Again lots of gore, no real violence, and no offensive language.

For the price I will recommend this double feature. Hmmm, there's a Casablance/African Queen double feature blue-ray for the same price!",1392854400,,1455,4.541984732824427
