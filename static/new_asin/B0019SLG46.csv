3443525,5,B0019SLG46,I really like this video.  I use it whenever I can't get out of the house to exercise with my 2 month old daughter or when my daughter just can't get to sleep.  It gets me moving and she's usually asleep by the end of the second song.,1224806400,,234,3.8541666666666665
3443526,5,B0019SLG46,"I received the dvd as a shower gift from a friend  a few months ago.  I have never gone without it since my daughter was born. It is the best thing out there right now as far as calming your baby, and getting back in shape.  I feel better than ever, and my baby never misses a nap!

It's THE BEST!!!!!!!",1219276800,,303,3.918032786885246
3443527,5,B0019SLG46,"Darcy approached me with this idea in September of last year after the birth of my second child, Lila. I thought it was such a good idea that I volunteered to help and have been working with her ever since. Lullaby Exercises has been a huge help to me as a busy mother of two. Lila often has difficulty settling down at night.  Instead of getting frustrated and losing my patience I put her in a baby carrier and get moving. She always goes to sleep and I have managed to work in a little exercise in the process. It picks me up and improves my mood, which helps me to be a better mother to my older daughter, Audrey. Once Lila is asleep we can share some special one on one time, something that is in short supply now that she has a little sister.

3443528,5,B0019SLG46,"What a combination of talent, dedication and committment!  These moms have found a way to focus on themselves AND their babies at the same time-working out and soothing simultaneously...I applaud their innovation and the inspiration that this DVD will undoubtedly provide to other new mothers who are looking for new ways to express themselves.",1219104000,,344,5.37037037037037
3443529,5,B0019SLG46,Chicks-n-Chickens is an innovative new approach to lulling our baby to sleep. The dvd provides us with a refreshing new way to begin naps and bedtime. The lullaby movements are soothing for parents too! A must for new parents!,1217980800,,226,4.82051282051282
3443530,4,B0019SLG46,"Not content with having to drive round your neighborhood in the evenings to get your loved one to sleep then this is for you.
It is billed as an exercise DVD (something that is positive for my wife & I), but the great bonus is that our little guy always nods off to sleep.

So nowadays we do the full half an hour video as a family in the evening & have a regular sleep pattern, no more evening drives, exercise for both Mon & Dad & a chance to have fun together.
I can imagine I will be donning the sling a lot more as our guy gets bigger but for now it's a great family experience.",1217894400,,583,3.940677966101695
3443531,5,B0019SLG46,As a new Mom and an OB/GYN Nurse Practitioner this is a unique and wonderful exercise program for any Parent.  Darcy Novo Albrecht is a great motivator and explains each exercise and gives details for modifying each exercise depending where you are in your post natal time frame.  My daughter was instantly soothed as I painfully attempted to get back into shape.  Now that I'm back to work full time this DVD is my time to have my daughter close to me again and we both benefit from this great work out.  A must have for any new Mom!,1217462400,,534,4.363636363636363
3443532,5,B0019SLG46,"This is the one ""mommy and me"" workout that I can get through without my baby melting down halfway through, because it actually puts her to sleep! And the workout is as challenging or as easy as you want it to be (you can do each set once, or as many times as you want). It was perfect for those early days when I wasn't up for going back to the gym but really needed to feel like I was doing something to start moving again. And now that my baby is older it's great for soothing her when she's fussy with the added the bonus that I get a workout at the same time!",1217462400,,564,3.9130434782608696
3443533,5,B0019SLG46,"I put the DVD on as soon as it arrived, with my 10 week old in the sling and my 3 year old next to me. we loved it! the baby fell asleep in a minute and his sister had fun doing the stretches and moves. can't wait to start doing the full workout on a regular basis. it was a really good workout, better than expected. lisa's music is really beautiful which is a nice bonus!",1216857600,,373,3.857142857142857
3443534,5,B0019SLG46,"I've been giving this awesome DVD to all my friends as they become new moms... its so unique, fun and high-end.  They like that its made and tested by new moms who have been in their shoes - and it really works.  If only it'd been around when my little guy was a baby... maybe I'd be able to fit into my old jeans again.",1216857600,,320,3.9076923076923076
3443535,5,B0019SLG46,"I am due with my first baby in just a few weeks and I got this video as a baby shower gift, and I am really looking forward to trying it out once the baby arrives.  From what I have seen it will be fun for the baby and a good workout for me to get me motivated to get my pre-baby body back while still at home!  I plan to buy more of these to give as gifts to my expecting friends for their showers as well.  A great unique find.",1216771200,,429,3.641304347826087
3443536,5,B0019SLG46,I participated in one of Darcy's demonstrations and my then 6 month old son and I both had a great time!  What is so awesome about Lullaby is that not only do parents and baby get what they need from the exercises and an added fringe benefit (intentional or not!) is that an older sibling can join in as well.  My four year old loves the music and dancing.  Thanks for getting our family grooving!,1216771200,,397,4.266666666666667
3443537,5,B0019SLG46,"We had the great pleasure of hosting Darcy's chicken groove session at Playdate Cafe in San Anselmo. She rocked our crib and the mamas were positively glowing after their work-outs. If you're looking for a work-out to get your pre-baby body back or simply want to share the joy of creative movement with your child, your search is over. Highly recommended for any caregivers who need a little pick-me-up!",1216771200,,404,4.869565217391305
3443538,5,B0019SLG46,"It took a mom. Great ideas always seem so simple AFTER someone thinks of them. Darcy Novo-Albrecht's creation of an at-home exercise video that both tones moms and soothes babies came from her own experience. It's fun and it works (I'm a Nana who's watched). The DVD is very carefully done technically, with cool original music, but features real moms with their babies. It's also a great gift. chicks-n-chickens.com has more info and products.",1216771200,,444,5.013513513513513
3443539,5,B0019SLG46,"I have had the pleasure of hosting chicks-n-chickens at Playtime Safari in Novato. Darcy taught me the ""Chicken Groove"" and I loved it. It's fun and I actually could feel my legs burning! She has inspired me to get groovin' again! I highly recommend Lullaby Exercises to all new and not so new moms!",1216771200,,299,4.555555555555555
3443540,5,B0019SLG46,"I am a new Mom who was looking for something my 3 month old daughter and I could do together (not to mention I needed to get back in shape). We attended the Lullaby Exercises class.  What a morale booster!  It was just what the doctor ordered!  Great way for us to bond while Mommy got a workout. It got me moving and my daughter was asleep shortly after the class!!

I bought the DVD and we love using it at home especially for those days when we just can't seem to get out the door to get some exercise.  More importantly, when she is fussy or needs some help getting to sleep, it calms her and puts her into lullaby mode.  What a Great Find!!!!!",1216339200,,648,4.103174603174603
8275196,2,B0019SLG46,"The lullaby music presented in the DVD and CD (3-4 songs)is really nice. It feels very peaceful and pleasant.

However, I must say the exercise portion of the DVD has no value to me. It is not a well structured exercise at all. You don't need this DVD to do that sort of activity - just hold your baby and move side by side with the music. I don't know why this DVD has such high rating.

If I can choose again, I will just use a lullaby CD and hold my baby to move around as an exercise. No need for this DVD.",1327881600,,510,3.894230769230769
8275197,5,B0019SLG46,"you're not gonna form buns-of-steel with this video, but that's not the point. those first few weeks (and months) postpartum is a time of immense recovery. it's almost as if you have to relearn how to move in your body and this gentle dvd is perfect for that. i started using this video about 8 weeks after the birth of my first child and really wish i had started using it earlier. the music is catchy. the instructor is very sweet. you can do a 5 minute song or the whole dvd. best of all, it's wonderful and guided way to connect with your baby & your body in those early and exhausting first days. (and as a bonus it usually puts little ones to sleep). highly recommend it!",1310515200,,677,4.255813953488372
8275198,5,B0019SLG46,"I have really enjoyed the music & the moves in this video. It has been a great way to return to exercising after baby number three. I like how each song targets a different area (cardio, legs, etc), so that I can choose exactly what I want to work on in the often limited time frames that I have. My son also loves the rhythm & has fallen asleep many a time this way. It worked well with me wearing him in a ring sling initially, and now that he is substantially larger it works just as well using a wrap.",1289347200,,505,4.00990099009901
8275199,5,B0019SLG46,"My daughter is 8 weeks old and we just started doing the Lullaby Exercises.  It is wonderful!  The music is awesome to listen to as well.  I put my daughter in a Moby carrier and within minutes of starting the DVD she is asleep.  The exercises are light, but they are great for someone like me who has been a couch potato during pregnancy and wants to start becoming more active again.  It is also a good bonding time with my daughter who likes to be held and snuggled, especially in the evenings.  I am so happy I found this DVD!",1274745600,,530,4.198019801980198
8275200,4,B0019SLG46,"I started this when my daughter was 4 months old.  It was the only way I could get in a workout.  I could do it when my 2 year old was sleeping and it would put my daughter to sleep; if I did it while my 2 year old was awake he danced along with us.  If you are at an excellent fitness level it really isn't a workout, but if you just want some exercise and want to do it with your baby it's awesome!  I also enjoyed the music as the singer's voice is very relaxing and helped me relax.  Now that my daughter is 6 months she's 16 lbs so it's more difficult but we still like it.",1267142400,,578,3.743801652892562
8275201,2,B0019SLG46,"The music is original and fun. I love it!  But don't buy this for the workout!  The only good part was the squats and I don't need to follow a DVD to do those holding my baby.  Anyone who has ever exercised in their life will be very disappointed!  They do push ups standing up while pushing your arms against ""air""...hello?  That does NOT work your chest muscles.  The lady is also kind of annoying.  It's a waste of money just for the music, but luckily we are at least enjoying that part.",1256774400,,491,4.21505376344086
8275202,5,B0019SLG46,I had twins and getting to the gym hasn't been an option.  This video has made working out a possibility for me.  It's actually fun to do.  The babies love it and so do.  What a great concept (while holding your baby in a sling) for how to exercise!!!,1254268800,,251,4.061224489795919
8275203,5,B0019SLG46,"This workout is great for right after you have a baby. It is quick and fun and it really does put your baby to sleep. The music is great and so is Darcy, the instructer. It is nice to put your baby in a sling and workout with other REAL mamas. The women in the video are real and of varying body types and fitness levels. This workout makes you feel good and gives you time to do something fun for yourself and to relax with your baby. It gives me a little time to myself and some special time with just my second child. This is the lift I need each day. It is also subtle exercise so you don't tend to replace the calories or think you can splurge because you ""worked out hard"". This is a good one for nursing mamas. I love it!

8275204,5,B0019SLG46,"My wife hasn't watched the video yet, so I can't comment yet on the workout but I must say the delivery and order execution was SPECTACULAR!!!
I ordered this item on a Monday & the delivery estimate was 7 to 10 days from California (I live in Florida).  Lo & behold...when I got home on Thursday there a wonderful little brown package waiting for me/my wife in the mailbox.  Not only had the item arrived waaaaaayyy ahead of schedule but to top it off, the package contained some *extra* little goodies (some snack bars) and a HANDWRITTEN NOTE thanking me for purchasing the DVD. Now, I order LOTS of stuff online and this is probably the FIRST time I have been so moved by the ""warm fuzzies"" of receiving the goods as to write a review on the product/service the next day - so big kudos to you, Chicks-n-Chickens, if your DVD is one tenth the quality of your service you will go far!  My wife & I will surely rave about this experience to our friends and other parents we meet for some time.",1235692800,,992,4.351351351351352
8275205,5,B0019SLG46,"What a fantastic workout! My three month old fights napping so when I finally get him down my priorities are bathing and eating. Exercising has not made it to the top of the list. Until today! I love Lullaby Exercises. I feel great after working some long-neglected muscles and my little chicken was out before we got through the second song in the sleep section. I'm going to a baby shower this weekend and I wish I had ordered two DVDs so I could take one as a gift. It was also packaged so nicely and even had a handwritten note from Darcy. Amazingly sweet touch. Do not hesitate, pick up at least one of these now. It is perfect for every new mommy.",1231372800,,653,4.274193548387097
