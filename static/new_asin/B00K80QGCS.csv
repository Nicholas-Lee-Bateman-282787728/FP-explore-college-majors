6404740,5,B00K80QGCS,"I read some reviews and thought this might be a cute movie to see.  I expected all the tired, worn out Mommy jokes that we always hear, but I thought the movie would be OK overall.  FROM THE ONSET...  I knew that I was in for a GOOD MOVIE!  I LAUGHED OUT LOUD it was so funny!  I found myself crying so many times through the movie because so much of it was relatable... her struggles as a Mom to please everyone and that constant nagging Mommy guilt...  I was amused and surprisingly inspired at the same time.  I came out of that theater THOROUGHLY entertained, already pumped to buy the DVD, and feeling REFRESHED and VALIDATED as a Mom.  It is a WELL DONE MOVIE on SOOO many levels!!!

Treat yourself.... You deserve it!!!  Watch This Movie!!!",1402790400,106,747,4.3478260869565215

6404743,5,B00K80QGCS,"I am not sure I have ever preordered a DVD, particularly before a release date has been set but I plan to order this one. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but I enjoyed every minute. If you have ever parented young children you will relate to the humor and if you have ever been a Stay at home mom then you will love it. This is a movie with a faith based message that doesn't sacrifice humor in the mix. It is completely clean but not straightlaced. I went home with a light heart, and renewed energy to take back to my family, Thank you to the producer, director, entire case for making a movie like this, it was desperately needed.",1401667200,99,646,4.176
6404744,5,B00K80QGCS,"This is delightful comedy that centers around stressed out super-mom Allyson (Sarah Drew). She conspires with two other stressed out mom's to have a ""mom's night out""  and to let  Sean (Sean Astin) mind the kids along with his single buddy friend Kevin (Kevin Downes). The other two members of the threesome include Sondra (Patricia Heaton), the preacher's wife and Izzy (Faith based film cutie Logan White).

We discover that the ability to walk in heels is not like riding a bike. Both the women and the men are out of their element leading to an over-the-top comic adventure. While the situation approaches unrealistic, the one liners had me in stitches.  The plot is cliche and formulaic, but works with the characters and on screen chemistry.

The film has a faith based message and utilizes stars that have been strictly in faith based films. With the help of a few headliners to carry the film, plus a decent script that wasn't bogged down with a faith message, this film was delightful, even to this old atheist cynic.

Trace Adkins played a philosophical biker who tells Allyson and us, after a night of hell, what she apparently needed to know to enjoy life.

6404768,3,B00K80QGCS,"If you believe being a ""stay at home"" mother is debilitating, exhausting, and suffocating, this is the movie for YOU! If you don't, and I didn't, you may at least find it humorous.  Just keep in mind that it is NOT REAL and most women who have the privilege of being FULL-TIME mothers love the joys and challenges of taking helpless babies and turning them into contributing adults. (I did; my daughter does.)  Yes, there are moments of frustration, but the sight of your baby's first step, first dry all day diaper, and hearing the adorable way a two year old links words together puts it all into perspective.  Being a fulltime mom requires sacrifice and creativity like no other career.  The movie ending sorta makes up for the self-pitying of the first 20 minutes.  I just hope that's the part that's remembered.  Personally, I can't seriously recommend this movie except as a ridiculous parody.",1527120000,2,899,4.767741935483871

6404798,4,B00K80QGCS,"RELEASED 2011 and directed by The Erwin Brothers, Moms Night Out is a dramedy about three mothers in Birmingham (Sarah Drew, Patricia Heaton & Andrea Logan White) who go out on the town while their husbands & a friend watch the kids (Sean Astin, Robert Amaya & Kevin Downes). Alex Kendrick plays the pastor and Sammi Hanratty the teen daughter. Trace Adkins appears as a tough biker while David Hunt is on hand as a helpful cabbie. Andrea Logan White plays a friend of the three moms while Harry Shum Jr. appears as her ex-beau.

This is a family friendly dramedy with a little edge and slight faith-based elements (limited to one comical church scene and one exchange at the end). The ""inept dad"" theme is tiresome and unrealistic (it seemed to me like the children lacked discipline). But there are some gems to mine, like the female lead being overwhelmed by her own doing. In short, she set an absurd standard for herself and labored under her self-imposed expectations.

The church bathroom scene is hilarious. Have you ever had a meltdown over something trivial due to pent-up frustration and were embarrassed to discover that someone saw/heard you? Theres another laugh-out-loud sequence when someone is innocently doing something, which is inadvertently telegraphed to a bunch of others, but offering the wrong impression.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a fun movie with several genuinely humorous moments and a lil bit of mind/spirit food.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours 38 minutes and was shot in Birmingham, Alabama, and Pelham, which is just South. WRITERS: Jon Erwin and Andrea Nasfell.

6404858,5,B00K80QGCS,"This has to be one of my favorite movies. Its funny but it's a ""clean"" funny that most parents can appreciate. It's something I can watch with my kids or if they're in the other room and I don't have to worry about them hearing curse words or seeing violence. And it always puts me in a good mood.

I'm not very religious, I consider myself more of a spiritual person and this movie is technically a religious (Christian) movie...BUT that said, it's not a shove-it-in-your-face-lets-talk-about-god-every-5minutes kind of movie. It's no more that kind of movie than most other movies on the market so if you aren't Christian or religious don't let the fact that it's a religious movie deter you from it cause it is a good watch!",1503446400,,727,4.635658914728682

6404862,3,B00K80QGCS,"It was contemporary, the ladies in the movie acted outside the biblical concept of womanhood, Worldly Be cautious watching this with younger daughter as the dress and attitude would not be appropriate for Christian women.  We must be in the world, but not OF it, and the sensual dress, wanting to look ""hot"" as a married woman is not becoming of a Godly married (or single) lady.  Not desiring to be lusted after.  Propriety and modesty starts in the heart and works outward, so be cautious about watching this.",1502668800,,511,4.719101123595506

6404869,5,B00K80QGCS,Loved this movie.  I laughed so much my jaw hurt.  Lot's of pop culture references and silliness.  I think having kids makes it easier to relate to but still a wonderful movie.  My 12 year old son loved it as well.,1501632000,,214,4.146341463414634

6404871,1,B00K80QGCS,This is NOT a video I would show to my family because it looks far too much like the world we line in and the behavior is impolite and crude.  I am very disappointed in the film as too the actors for doing this film.  It should be rated R for ridiculous or pg 13 for poor adult behavior.,1501200000,,287,3.847457627118644

The movie was funny, but there is a great message here for Moms who are trying to do it all. After movie discussion allowed some of us more experienced Moms to share our stories with some newer Moms.  To our surprise a lot of the younger ladies in our church thought us ""older"" gals had always had it all together. Uh...no!!  Try this out for some bonding time with some gals in your church, your bible study, or just a girlfriend's night out.  It's a good laugh, a good lesson, and worth the money spent to open discussion.",1499472000,,683,4.151515151515151

First this company has made 6 or 8 other movies, which they discuss before you get to see the main feature. THEN you have to sit through a PREVIEW of EVERYONE of the 6 or 8 other features BEFORE you get to see the main feature.
To add insult to injury, EVERYTHING about THIS movie SUCKS, and its NOT FUNNY.
The ""Heaven is for Real"" movie is really great, Saw it on TV, bought the DVD.

The women in the movie want a well-deserved night out to unwind from daily responsibilities, however it turns out to be a bit of a nightmare. Everything goes wrong, and while it seems a bit over the top, it is intentional to enforce the message that even if things seem to be at their worst, we are still a good mom because we care and are doing the best we can. Moms aren't and don't have to be perfect. It also reminds us that not only is being a mom the hardest job on earth, it is also rewarding.

6404963,2,B00K80QGCS,"Some pretty funny scenes, but overall the overbearing religious ""moral"" in this movie ruins it.  Women are made out to be strong, but only in taking care of children.  Men are hopeless and helpless as far as children go. Ugh, it's like we stepped back to Victorian times.  The roles/characters are so unbelievable and ridiculous.  It's like if you got a pamphlet from a church and decided to make a movie based on it.

The leading role is a woman who apparently homeschools her 3 kids and feels like a failure because her house is messy.  Her husband is always traveling and can't take care of his children (I guess god didn't make men able to do that, as far as the movie teaches).  I homeschool 3 kids and I work and have a career, and yes the house is messy...  who cares?  You either choose a clean house or kids.  Oh and the woman is so ""fulfilled"" by also being a mommy blogger. Stereotypes all around.

There are several funny scenes in the movie - I did laugh a few times.",1485561600,,980,4.329670329670329

The main character is a 'manic mommy' who (as others have suggested) needs therapy. And the fathers are clueless as parents. The whole storyline was ridiculous. I'm glad we only rented it. Save your money on this one, and get a real Christian movie like Courageous. Now there's some class act parenting. Looking for a Christian comedy? Road to Redemption is a great one! I would do a pros and cons list, but this is one time I can't think of a single redeemable quality to give it a pro.

6405073,5,B00K80QGCS,"This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where everything that can go wrong in one night does but there is still a happy ending. Particularly I loved the music included because nearly all of them were popular songs that I've heard before and enjoyed. My favorite character has got to be Bones the biker guy because he is not one to be judged by appearances.

It's clear that they tried to insert some kind of message about Christianity in it, but it wasn't so big as to ruin the rest of the movie. All in all it's a great comedy that beats most others because there is no sex and only very minimal violence while the group tries to find the missing baby.",1473379200,2,690,4.267175572519084

Movie reviewers said it was like a giant episode of ""The Middle"". I don't think they actually watched this movie - as Patricia Heaton's character is NOTHING like Frankie Heck. The story is nothing like The Middle, or Everybody Loves Raymond, either. Maybe they were stoned. Or maybe they were mad because there's no sex in this movie - oh and it does have a bit of a Christian message, but not  preachy. This movies was made primarily for Christians, but I think anyone can enjoy it.  My sister did and she's a Buddhist.",1469750400,3,709,4.363636363636363

If you are into wholesome Christian films then you may tolerate this comedy but I was duped by the trailer into thinking this would be a funny mainstream movie, something along the lines of ""Date Night"". It's not. It is like a knock-off of ""The Family Circus"" in cinematic form. I turned it off when I began to dry-heave from all the sappiness.

Yes, there are Christians in the movie and yes they mention God and share positive encouragement with God in it, but that can't possibly be a negative unless you're predisposed to getting upset about that suit if thing.  This is not a ""Christian"" movie. most of those are rather boring, seriously flawed projects, that seek to tell all those non believers how wrong they are. This is not one of those films.  I watch films and shows with characters of all faiths and plenty of atheists and enjoy those too.

6405280,5,B00K80QGCS,"This movie is so good I just had to order a copy from Amazon after watching it. As a dad, I connected to many parts of it since I am active in taking care of the kids and work together with my wife in taking care of the housework (with 3 little kids messing the house up every step of the way). I also found it to be super hilarious throughout as random bad things keep happening to them. It could be that I was watching this after midnight, but this was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I highly recommend it to anyone who has young kids, especially moms (I am sure my wife will get a kick out of this movie... she has not seen it yet). Even if you don't have kids, I am sure you will find many things very funny.

The comedy style is very similar to movies like Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, Daddy Day Care, and other movies like those.

It also has some faith aspects to it (as it was done by Providence Films), but those parts are not hugely overt, so I think even those who are not religious would still enjoy this movie. Although, being a Christian, I found the subtle injection of faith throughout to be refreshing for this style of movie - one that is not JUST about faith, but it a fun comedy.",1461801600,5,1218,4.049792531120332

6405291,4,B00K80QGCS,"We just watched this at home as a rental and enjoyed it as lighthearted fare with a message.

As a theatrical production it's so-so, more made-for-TV than a big picture release.  But I was struck by the professional critics' pans (18% on Rotten Tomatoes according to Google) compared to overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon.  I traipsed over to the review on the late Roger Ebert website (a guy who at the Sun-Times symbolized old-fashioned common sense, somebody who could remember there's something called middle-of-the-road because there's a view to the left and one to the right and the two views might have individually valid points of their own), written by a Christy Lemire whose pan seemed to be about this movie's ""regressive and borderline dangerous"" message to women.

Then I watched my own wife's reaction to this film, and especially to her tearing up at the central statement delivered by the Trace Adkins character Bones towards the end of the movie.  We are evangelical Christians but I'm not especially fond of much of what goes out as Christian entertainment, but this movie was not preachy at all.  What it does give is an affirming message that women who have sacrificed (and sacrifice is the right word) for a mission of raising children and maintaining the home are, as the Sean Astin character says, important.  Mainstream reviews seem to imply women can't take accept that message without by definition being labeled regressive and borderline dangerous (is empowerment just for the office, I wonder?).  And that seemed to tell me more about Ms. Lemire herself than the validity of any view she's trying to argue.

If you want to understand Cultural Wars in America, you can find an example here in the contrast between Mainstream reviews and what many (not all) of everyday people think.",1461456000,,1821,4.963815789473684

6405297,1,B00K80QGCS,"How is this an enjoyable movie to people? How is this make anybody laugh or giggle or crack a smile? Worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen Sharknado with less complaints.

LET ME STATE: I understand that movies are unrealistic and I'm fine with it. I actually dislike it when people complain about movies being unrealistic, it's a movie, get over it, right?

BUT OH MY GOSH....horrible. As a parent of two these situations portrayed are just plain dumb. They weren't an over the top depiction of what could happen like most movies do, this was a full out ""huh?"" over and over again.
I was honestly expecting a cheesy mommy version of the Hangover or Bridesmaids. I was expecting relatable situations where I'd giggle and say ""yep"" to myself. No. This was just plain a NO.

The main character is annoying. Parents get stressed with their kids. It can be funny - locking yourself in the bathroom, yep, sure, but this is a farce of a woman who needs a psychotherapist and perhaps a padded room.
The friends husband with his ""fear of children"" to the point where he screams when there are trick or treaters at his door having two of his own? What? Wasn't that a fear better provided to the husbands friend and still could have been played up?

As a Catholic I don't mind the religious parts of the movie but can understand it being a nuisance to others. I however cannot see where people are considering this a great Catholic/Christian movie. It doesn't really revolve around church enough to be considered as such in my opinion. The movie throws in a few ""Jesus loves you"" references so that the main character doesn't drive off a cliff with her kids in the backseat while she laughs manically....but that's as far as it goes.

Upsetting to see Patricia Heaton and Sean Austin in such a film.",1461196800,5,1792,4.570093457943925

6405308,5,B00K80QGCS,"So here is the truth.... This movie is about mom's. Mom's who give up too much of themselves to make their houses look great, their families lives easier and so much more. This movie is about mom's not valuing their work and their lives near as much they should. This movie is about mom's looking around and wondering- what? Is this it? This movie is about mom's and their point of view. Everything in this movie is exaggerated, except for the mom's point of view about themselves and their lives.

The kids are louder and crazier and the houses are messier and the men are more incompetent than you would typically find in real life. But there are three mom's. The mom with the preacher husband and the teen age daughter (boy can I relate there), the single mom, the mom with three kids and the pregnant mom.

And the mom's need a night out. And in typical fashion it doesn't happen because the kids need them and the husbands need them. Instead of the phone ringing though- What ensues is a romp through town chasing 'stolen vans', lost babies, and generall chaos.

What hit home for me was the beginning and the ending. The mom hiding in the closet for a few minutes of peace and the wife trying to ensure her daughter doesn't make the same mistakes she did. There is a mom or a moment or whole lot of minutes in here for every mother, a point that you can say 'oh gosh, that is my life.'

This isn't a serious movie. It is a nice, easy to watch movie. I enjoyed it and I related to it and the end was a great wrap up for me.
Enjoy.",1460073600,2,1535,4.2465753424657535

6405333,5,B00K80QGCS,"Normally I don't like faith based movies because they have poor acting, they over-sell Christianity as a life style (Mom and Dad have traditional roles / adhere to ""Biblical"" interpretations), the ""come to Jesus"" message is ""in-your-face"" and the plot is predictable. This movie is laugh out loud funny in places, fast paced, action packed, and unpredictable. It opens with a mom of three (who is a stay at home ""Mommy Blogger"") facing a real case of burnout. Dad is on travel (again) and Mom is losing it. We soon meet her best friend (mom of twins with a positive pregnancy test) and the preacher's wife (mom of a strong-willed teen girl). The premise is that these women desperately need a night out to rediscover who they are (apart from being just mom and wife). The dads agree to babysit the children (sort of like Daddy Daycare). Things soon go horribly wrong... and, without spoiling the plot, lets just say that there are splendidly executed car chases, EMTs, Police cruisers, a local jail, a tattoo parlor, motor cycle gangs, and a parakeet involved. Once I got past the whole ""Mommy Blogger"" thing -- what I liked most about the movie was that the men (husbands / dads) were supportive, engaged and funny (doing the best that they could) and the message came through loud and clear that parenting / maintaining the home is not just Mom's job -- it's a shared / equal responsibility. The husbands actively demonstrated that they knew / appreciated that the women's job is far more difficult than theirs. Additionally, the ""Jesus speech"" is softly delivered toward the end and it's not a turn off. There is a lot to love about this movie and I highly recommend that families watch this together.",1458086400,,1704,4.7407407407407405

6405347,4,B00K80QGCS,"As a Christian, I find most Christian movies annoying. They normally placate to the choir, and put the gospel message so far forward they sound incredibly scripted, like you're listening to a used car salesman read from an old Christian tract.

This movie is billed as a comedy and rightfully so. Is it predictable at times, yes, but many comedies actually are, but are still funny. There are a few laugh out loud moment in this, and it goes places i didn't think it would dare to go. It even pokes fun at the nauseatingly fake church lady, while having the truth of the message be delivered by the most ""unlikely"" character.

It was a lot less nauseating cute and less like a ""human video"" type of presentation than I thought it would be. I think many of the people that don't like it reject it because it has a smidgen of a Christian message to it. But compared to other Christian movies it doesn't beat you over the head with it, or sound scripted.

If you're not afraid of a Christian film that's kind of edgy, watch this film.",1457136000,,1031,4.41578947368421

The story is contrived, the situations that the main characters get into are completely ridiculous and the main character seems to have a serious case of ADHD and depression. Not the best way to start a movie. The dads in the film are completely useless tools who can't care for their own children and there is some serious stereotyping going on here.

6405428,4,B00K80QGCS,"My wife checked this out from the Library. I figured it was a chick flic movie and was doing something else in the living room as she played it.

Patricia Heaton, Sean Aston (Lord of the Rings), Robert Amaya (Courageous) and the actor playing the biker caught my attention, so I kept watching. The story is realistic in that there ARE days when ""All Hell breaks loose"". The producers just spun that as comedy. I have taken 3 or 4 acting courses at the University of South Carolina and something I learned early is that comedy is perhaps the most difficult genre to act or produce.
Timing is everything.

Does the film deserve an academy award ? no  Is it good ?  Yes, I think the actors are first class (It showed me a breadth of ability that I did not know Sean Aston had) , there was a lot of successful improve in the film ! It takes professionals to pull that off.

So I would say it is as good as anything produced in Hollywood.  And you do realize that Hollywood films go from the greatest ever made to a ""complete bust"" don't you ?

In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Proverbs 3:5-6  The Lord will guide you in what to say and do, if you acknowledge Him.  Plan in your day to spend time with the Lord, asking Him to be in control of your thoughts, your words and your actions.
If you have it all together, then why do you need a Saviour?  Jesus said in John 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.  When the going gets tough, remember what Jesus said in Matthew 11:28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

6405464,1,B00K80QGCS,"So it's Saturday night and all the family movies in our local Redbox are out except this seemingly mix of Daddy Day Care and the first part of Knocked Up and my daughter wants to see it.  Wow, what a bad decision.  This movie was just awful.  We all have heard about shill reviews on Amazon, with marketing companies loading up mediocre products here with 5/5-star reviews (e.g. the 5th of George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones books A Dance With Dragons).  Something similar happened here to get this movie so many 5/5-star ratings.  I suspect some biblethumper website started a review-writing campaign to promote this pro-Church movie given that normal, moderately intelligent people could not stomach it.

Here's the premise:  wonderfully caring, faithful, Church-going Allyson, a stay-at-home mom of three, has reached the end of her tether and needs a break from the hellish routine of being a mom, so she recruits her best friend and the oh-so-perfect, somewhat older wife of their pastor to go out on the town and Yeah!! they have a Groupon! (Groupon must have paid a product placement fee)..  But what on earth can be done about their children?  Oh, I guess we have to leave them with the dads.  OK, this is going to blow your mind, it's so impossible to predict this, but the girls' evening out doesn't go as planned, the dads aren't successful at watching and caring for their children, they cry out in panic to their wives to help them perform the fundamental tasks of ...  being a parent ... and Hijinks ensue!!!!

PROS:

- Lead actor Sarah Drew (Grays Anatomy) is pretty cute in an Amy Adams - Isla Fisher redhead sort of way.
- There are a number of B to C List actors here that will be vaguely familiar, including B+ lister Patricia Heaton and our good hobbit buddy Sean Astin (Sam from Lord of the Rings)

CONS  (Warning:  contains spoilers)

- Men in general and dads in particular are portrayed as absolute morons, incapable of exercising even the smallest degree of common sense or parenting skills.  Said dads never spend any time with their families, instead traveling constantly for work or hanging with their bro's playing video games.

- As long as they are Good Christian Ladies, the women in the story are more-or-less pure saints.  All other women are skanks and morons.

- The children in the story, prior to the last five minutes, are such caricatures of out-of-control demon brats that it's ridiculous - Mother Theresa would have gone after these kids with a shovel, they're so over-the-top awful behaving.  Actually, all the characters in this movie are caricatures, sophomorically exaggerated.

- There just aren't any funny scenes.  A mom lets a kid apply mascara with disastrous results right before going in to church.  Nope, not funny.  A snotty dimwit new age restaurant hostess turns our girls away and refers to their impact on the restaurant's ""aura?""  No, that was a miss, too.  A biker gang-leader with a heart of gold headbutts some scumbag?  Nope.  Of course every one has to end up in jail in the middle of the night?  Predictable, yes.  Humorous?  No.

- Once the night-out starts, we find that the protagonist's step-sister-in-law has left her baby with its irresponsible father, who of course ditches the kid with some recovering alcoholic to go on a date with a bimbo, and of course said recovering alcoholic must be portrayed not as a person with an illness, but as a vile Non-Church-Goer, who relapses and disappears with the baby.  This is the main focus of the story, finding the baby ... until the creators of this movie thought ""Let's add some levity with more hijinks and shenanigans!!!!""  and then everyone in the movie basically forgets that there's a missing baby for the next half hour.  But don't fret, good viewers, we have the husband of the good pastor's wife (for those of you who gave the movie 5-stars, I'm referring to the pastor himself) assemble a massive task force of ... police and church-going biker gang members ... to track down the missing baby at the end, all possible because our pal the pastor is so adept at spreddin' the Word of God that he can call in lots of favors.

- The movie heavy-handily promotes Christianity.  All the Church-goers are Really Good People, if a bit pseudo-comically flawed, and they all tell us how it's their faith that makes things good for them.  All of the bad people have no trace of Good Church Goer about them.  If people want to make overtly religious movies, that's fine - just provide us with some notice that a movie is going to promote a religion to allow those of us not into such themes the ability to make a knowledgeable choice about whether or not to watch it.  There was nothing about this movie, from its description at the Redbox kiosk, nor in its description here on Amazon, to indicate that it was intended to appeal to the bible-thumping crowd.  A person's choice on religion is a very personal choice, just as much so as the decision about how one should conduct one's love life.  Just as I really don't need to know that a particular couple likes to dress up as Batman and Robin in their bedroom, I also don't need to know about other people's beliefs in a Bronze-and-Iron-Age mythology.  Keep personal and private matters personal and private.

- The movie's conclusion is ironically more in tune with the general philosophy of the Taliban than it is with modern American life, Christian or otherwise.  Allyson sits down at the end and in that blog of hers that she just couldn't get started, which after her mom's night out she is all ready to address, she writes what she has come to learn and appreciate from all her adventures.  What bit of worldly wisdom has she acquired, you ask?  Nothing that fundamentalist male religious types haven't been preaching for thousands of years and continue to demand of their female slaves ... er  ... wives in such wonderful places as Afghanistan, ISIS, and Iran:  a woman's place is in the home raising children and she should just shut the hell up and not complain because a true woman-of-faith has all she needs to keep her happy in her kids, her husband, her housekeeping, and her god. Not a very progressive, modern message, if one bothers to think about it.  But rational and intelligent thought is the antithesis of religion, isn't it?

- Ironically, in the mini-cut scenes while the credits are rolling, there is a scene where Allyson, our good and virtuous model Christian Wife, decides she wants herself a hunk of hobbit tail and she jumps her hubby on the couch in broad daylight, only to have one of the kids come down the stairs and see momma trying to shag dada Samwise (sorry but I just can't see Sean Astin in any other role).  It was a weird scene and was hardly consistent with rest of the movie which promoted so-called family values.

CONCLUSION:

This movie was an ill-conceived mass of stereotypes and silly caricatures that never managed to be funny, just trite and annoying.  A decade ago when I became a dad, I was shocked to see that the fairly significant quantity of good movies appropriate for kids to watch just aren't out there any more in modern cinematic releases appropriate for the sub-PG-13 group of children to watch.  But the mere fact that there should be more genuine family movies with child-appropriate themes and scenes does not mean that those movies rated PG or less automatically deserve an enthusiastically positive rating.  This one sure doesn't.

Let's be perfectly blunt:  if this movie omitted all mentions of Church or god from the dozen or so scenes that promote religion, at least 90% of the people who posted 5/5-star reviews either wouldn't have given it above a 3/5-star rating and/or would not have bothered to review this likely straight-to-DVD movie in the first place.  There is a very good reason this movie rated a 25% on Metacritic - it's pure garbage.

PS:  I predict that this review is going to attract more than a few Not Helpful ratings from the sorts of people who gave it so many 5/5-star ratings.  If you plan to tag my review with a Not Helpful, please do me a favor - don't just do a cowardly click-and-run NH rating on my review, sit down and in a comment, tell me exactly how anything I have said in this review is not completely accurate or fair.  Don't just rant or call me names, use facts, logic, reason, and examples, as I have done above, to tell me how this review is in any way not a reasonable description of this movie's pros and cons.  Thank you.",1448150400,8,8506,4.6644295302013425

6405505,5,B00K80QGCS,"This is the most fun to watch movie ever. it may seem like it is a chick-flick, but it is great for guys as well. Between the laughs is a poignant story and lessons of how not normal life really is. It shows the struggle to be a good mother but also how much men need to support the home, (wife, kids, family). It also shows how important it is to have friends and a support group. We all need to work together closely to make life work. This is more about life lessons with some scenes about how God is important in our lives. We have watched it several times and it always is great. The lead character is unbelievably great. I don't know how they found her, but it is sure fortunate for us that they did. She delivers.",1444521600,,720,4.113475177304965

But it was some kind of chick flick!!!  Complete with car chase, tattoo parlor, and all the fixins.  And shockingly, it managed to be hilarious and interesting without vulgarity and other objectionable scenes!  People, IT CAN BE DONE!

The movie was a pretty accurate reflection of my own life.  Like many moms, I am waste deep in the day to day reality of raising small children.  I feel her pain.  I frequently wonder if the job I'm doing is good enough.  I frequently believe it is not.  That I am falling short.  Bone's words spoke to me and touched my heart.

I'm NOT a Christian and found the five minutes or so of God stuff pretty annoying, but still found this movie very entertaining and funny. Really, we ALL (moms, girlfriend, grandmas, and daughter) found it very entertaining and laughed our butts off, as it truly is a family friendly movie. The movie has high replay value, as I've watched it three times now.
The Blu-ray provides some nice extras. The special features include outtakes, deleted scenes, some shorts, and filmmaker's commentary, and won't leave you disappointed.",1433030400,,675,4.982300884955753

The acting is great, the humor is genuine, with very little slapstick comedy. This is the first Christian film in a looong time that I can genuinely say I loved! Most are very dramatic (which isn't bad) but it's hard to find a Christian film that showcases a Christian's ""normal"" life. Yes, this is over the top and goofy, but it shows three Christian women just wanting to go out and have fun. It's a fantastic movie and I will recommend it to EVERYONE.",1431216000,,586,4.336363636363636

6405682,5,B00K80QGCS,"There is nothing great or outstanding about this film to rave about.  Perhaps with a little more budget it could have been made better but this is without a doubt a good funny family movie with good clean humor you can watch with Kids and family.  Just for this, it deserves 5 stars.  Surprisingly this is not a Kid's movie.

It is indeed very nice to know that there are still folks out there in American cinema who can still make a good comedy without crude jokes and vulgarity.  For a while now I thought this was a long lost art unknown to the current generation of Hollywood & movie making folks in the US.  I still see many new good foreign comedy films in foreign languages but an American comedy today generally means a whole lot of sexual and crude jokes without which apparently Americans cannot laugh. And every new garbage from Hollywood pretending to be a comedy tries to outdo the previous one in touching new depths of depravity.  If it is an American comedy by default it has to be R rated.  So it comes as a very big surprise that an American comedy for Adults, and a pretty good one too, is rated PG.

Keep it up folks - looking forward to more movies like these.",1431216000,,1181,4.331818181818182

6405686,3,B00K80QGCS,"Improvisation and editing made this film as good as it was. I laughed - a lot. But I didn't care for the crazy action or soundtrack sometimes. I didn't like the stereotype that dads cant handle kids for a few hours without Mom either. Its a moral step down from Courageous. Allyson (Sarah Drew) is stressed out only because she doesnt discipline her wild kids. She doesnt realize that her unruly home is just another Monsters, Inc. Sean (Sean Astin) could share the work load too.

6405700,1,B00K80QGCS,"On a scale of one to five, this movie is a negative five! I bought this based off good reviews, and hey, I love a good clean comedy. First off, this movie was NOT funny. (Ok, we chuckled a little bit at one scene). The attempts at humor were so absurd, they were simply annoying. Secondly, everyone in the movie was completely incompetent and just stupid. Wow, we have the stressed out""Moms"", who really need psychological help. Then there are the ""Dads"" who just play video games and are incapable of responsibility. Thirdly, there was NO plot. Everything seemed disjointed and clumsy. Fourth, this was a Christian movie?!?!?!?! Because the people portrayed weren't Christians. Let's see: tough biker guy with a checkered past. Preachers wife who attended Woodstock reunion and has a secret tattoo that biker dude knows about.",1429747200,7,827,4.956834532374101
6405701,5,B00K80QGCS,"Received this movie last week.  Have watched it twice already.  You can sympathize with the young stay at home Mom who is trying so hard to be the perfect wife and Mom that she has perfected the art of ""never being good enough"" in her own mind.  Laugh outloud and cry if you want to as you watch her evening out with friends ""fall apart"".  They go through many unexpected adventures full of not perfect people and alot of calamity.  Great message.  Accept yourself.  Enjoy the dance.",1429747200,,483,4.482758620689655

The parts I found to be the most funny were the little things such as the texting auto-corrects, trying to wear heels when no longer used to them, and the contrast between the dads. Patricia Heaton's character was my favorite. I found the movie to be a nice escape while being reminded stressed parents are not alone. Maybe not for everyone with some of the exaggerated action scenes, I have no problem recommending this movie :) ..Oh, if you like the movie and make it to the end, there are more scenes during the credits.",1426896000,,676,4.373015873015873

6405755,5,B00K80QGCS,"My wife and I absolutely loved this movie. I always have a look at the negative reviews (if there are any), and there were the usual entries informing us that this was the worst movie ever made - a terrible movie - or, (no shortage of inventiveness here) a horrible movie. The few that actually specified what they found disappointing illustrated a reality that has become increasingly clear to me as I grow older: people are outrageously different from one another! We laughed our heads off. Allyson's attempt to describe her ""stolen"" car to the police was brilliant! (Well, let's see, it has a bumper sticker that says my home schooler crushes your honor student.) There were other great one liners that I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it. But the pacing, the comic timing, the steady increase in frenzy as more things went wrong, punctuated occasionally by a quiet moment, were all evidence of good directing. As for its being a Christian film, it was the first one I have seen that represented Christians as normal people. The characters were neither the platitude reciting automatons of yesterday, nor the even more offputting ""authentic"" types who populate the more recent efforts with all their scars and struggles. The latter come across as desperate attempts to gain traction with a skeptical world by hammering the ""hey, Christians are normal too"" gong a little too eagerly. That being said, was this movie a serious attempt to represent real life? Of course not! It was crazy! Stuff happened in it that would never happen in real life. Imagine encountering such a phenomenon in movies! Just let your guard down and have a good time.",1426809600,,1652,4.840989399293286

Of course, they didn't see us that way - they thought we were the best.  We didn't know that then!!  We just always worried we weren't enough- not good enough, not doing enough....

Forget the brainless critics numbed by the constant filth and dribble in theaters these days. 50 shades of gray is number 1 at the box office right now? Disheartening. While This movie, which tanked in theaters, is hilarious, and real. Motherhood is important. I agree with all the other 5 star reviews and especially loved the ending credits where after the feel good, inspiring part of the movie ended, they were right back to cleaning up messes and dealing with kids. Mothering 24/7 is like that. Exhausting, mind numbing work with spurts of tender, insightful moments woven in. I absolutely loved it!

6405812,2,B00K80QGCS,"The humor in this movie is WAY overrated. There are a few funny moments, but the scenarios are too exaggerated and unrealistic for it to feel real and genuinely entertaining. The lead mom is really fakey, annoyingly hyper, and extremely tiresome. We tried to watch this as a family at Christmas and shut if off after about 15 minutes from sheer boredom. I did finish watching it another night and my initial opinion was unchanged. It's just too dumb and overly contrived for it to be truly funny.

It's clean, but it is not the hilarious comedy it's cracked up to be. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.",1424649600,,606,4.45945945945946

The first time I watched it I literally laughed so hard I was crying! I have watched it several times since then and each time I catch something new and I still laugh just as hard as the first time! Essentially this is the story of a stressed out mom who plans a night out with the girls and basically everything goes wrong, but ends up making everything just right. Any mom/caretaker will relate to this and find it a breathe of fresh air to see that others have the same thoughts and feelings that you do. It provides encouragement to me when I feel overwhelmed and joy when I feel stressed out. The acting is great, the casting was spot on in every way, and the comedy keeps coming at you a mile a minute!

6405817,3,B00K80QGCS,"This is one of the best faith based movies I've seen, and I enjoyed it all the way through, despite its issues. I loved the look and feel of this movie. The characters are Christian, but the movie never wanders into preachy territory, thankfully. It's cute, clever, and succeeds at being funny some of the time, but it does fall short at others. I felt like some of the issues the main character had with her children could have been resolved if she would've just put her foot down. There's a scene where she and her kids are in the parking lot, about to get out of the car to go into church, and the daughter throws a fit when she sees the mom putting on her eye makeup, because the daughter wants to put the makeup on her instead. The mom refuses at first, but finally gives in to put an end to the girl's tantrum. So she allows her daughter (who's about 3-5 years old) do her eye makeup, and then has to run into the bathroom at church to undo the terrible makeup job, adding to her already high stress levels. I'm not going to say parenting is easy, but these are the kinds of issues this mom had, and they could have been avoided if she had just taken a firmer approach with her children, instead of letting them walk all over her.

The overall problem with the movie is that its plot is just too unbelievable, and at times it hurts the dialogue and some of the acting. These moms should be able to have a night out, and leave their kids at home with their husbands, without the world falling apart. And the whole losing the baby plot line just didn't work either. It was too ridiculous. What normal person would leave their baby with the guy at the tattoo shop? And why do people keep passing the baby around to different people without thinking of telling the parents?

This movie earns 3 stars for not making the mistakes that Christian movies are notorious for making: unprofessional looking cinematography, subpar acting throughout, and dealing with subjects that are too heavy or intensely religious which translates into preachiness/cringe-worthiness for Christians and non-Christians alike. But no more than 3 stars because its polished look and spunkiness don't make up for the outlandish plot that hampers what could have been a much better movie had they toned it down a bit.",1424563200,2,2291,4.531400966183575

It touched on so many of the issues my husband and I have often discussed.  I cannot tell you how many times my husband has said that I needed to make friends, to have mommy time, etc.  With four kids, I just could not see a way.  Something about seeing so many of my own issues portrayed in such a way that you can laugh over them and knowing that so many other women have the same struggles touches my heart.  I also love it that the pastor's wife in the story was portrayed as a regular person, with regular mother-to-teenaged-daughter issues.

Apparently, Christian men are UTTERLY incapable of caring for their of children. One man is even AFRAID of his children! Signs of depression and requests for help are met with a ""suck it up and obey your religion"" attitude. There is absolutely no character growth, just a depressed, struggling woman who receives no support of any kind from her useless and self-serving husband and the message from her religious community that it is her role in life to suffer and pretend that it is noble. Oh yes, and for some reason, this is supposed to be funny. I am completely disgusted.",1420934400,4,727,4.732283464566929
6405901,5,B00K80QGCS,"Right after watching this, I decided to check out the special features and noticed a particular one- The Art of Improv. Huh?
I immediately checked it out and my whole perspective of the film was blown further away than what it was, the fact that many, many lines were just improvised on the spot, in turn enhancing many of the jokes and situations.
Essentially, with what the directors said about their film project, this is the family-friendly version of Dane Cook's movie ""My Best Friend's Girl"", where 90% of the script was deviated and the characters spoke more from what they wanted to say than what was written for them. In this, no sex jokes, no swearing, no drugs, but so many blatantly comical moments that sent me howling with my family's dog.
Not only was the story incredibly heartwarming and spiritually challenging (when necessary), I also enjoyed the use of CGI so you could read people's blogs getting types, texts being e-mailed (a couple were downright chuckle-worthy), and even a couple scenes that included what Sarah Drew's character's biggest fears were (very well done in that aspect, especially for any mothers out there).
Trace Adkins' gruff biker character was top-notch, even with the little moment where he shares a profoundly deep thought about God. Everyone else? Every does their characters exceptionally well, as I would hope for since he was a great ensemble casted: Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings, The Colour of Magic, The Goonies, Amazing Love: The Story of Hosea, The Strain), Patricia Heaton (Home Improvement), even Andrea Logan White (Revelation Road 1+2) and Alex Kendrick (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous).
This movie has everything I would hope for in a good, family-friendly, Christian movie without going the way of boring snoozefests. If anyone's offended over some slapstick violence in a couple scenes, then don't bother (there's a reason it's rated PG, but it's nowhere near as bad as Ringo).
I hope Pure|Flix continues doling out this kind of quality film.",1420848000,,2023,5.04179104477612

6405908,2,B00K80QGCS,"Moms' Night Out could have been so much more.  It's about a group of young mothers who struggle with the daily life of raising their kids and become stressed out as a result, so the husbands decide to participate in a little babysitting while the mothers go out on the town for a night of fun.  The mothers knowing what their husbands are like alone with the kids, and how some of them never grew up with their little video game obsession, are strongly against the idea.  However the fathers eventually take care of the kids for the evening anyway.

The concept sounds exhilarating right?  I mean what can go wrong?  It's about kids walking all over the men with tons of hilarious moments along the way... at least, that's what *should* have happened.  Instead we ever hardly see the kids/fathers misadventures at all.  Instead we get weak and rushed writing, and a pitiful attempt to deliver in the storytelling which just about destroys this film for the first half.  Thankfully it picks up during the final 30 minutes.  The first 20 minutes are quite brutal though.

The biggest problem I found with the film is that there's no excitement or memorable/coherent storyline at all pertaining to the most crucial part of the plot- that being the fathers failing to take care of the kids for the night.  To make matters even worse, when the kids eventually turn up missing due to the incompetence of the husbands, nothing funny or interesting occurs so why should *we* care if the kids disappear?  The storyline throughout the movie focuses mainly on the mothers wandering around town and freaking out over the whereabouts of the one mothers baby which abruptly cuts short their night of fun.  Too bad- the part where the mothers visit a restaurant and start a fight with the waitress behind the desk had potential.  Instead this scene (and the whole movie for that matter) feels weak and too girly.  The father with the bird problem in the car didn't help matters.  That whole scene was just awful to watch.

For some reason the writing does whatever it can to avoid showing the exciting parts of the husbands being bad parents, so it's more like the husbands call the mothers and say there's been a problem and now the kid is missing.  The movie fails to show us what happened and instead explains it through phone conversations.  So don't expect any Adventures of Babysitting type storyline (classic 1987 comedy that I must have watched 10 times).  Oddly, as I mention in the previous paragraph, the writing mostly centers around the women and their reactions to the men screwing up a simple babysitting job and significantly less on the kids.  Perhaps the writers thought the mothers perspective would be the more humorous and noteworthy aspect, but sadly almost none of the characters are memorable at all so it fails.  I'd have rather been watching the fathers reactions to their inability to babysit the kids.  I'm pretty sure most people feel the same way.  Then again for some mysterious reason this *is* a highly rated movie here on amazon so maybe not.

Moms' Night Out is also a victim of a constantly fast-moving pace, but failing to deliver with the laughs and enticing storyline because instead of fully carrying out each segment, it immediately shifts into another direction/segment.  The movie flows at a speed that's quite difficult to keep up with, and the weak writing certainly doesn't encourage me to keep up with it either.

To give a compliment, the movie *does* finally improve in the second half.  When the situation becomes too much to handle and the fathers (and mothers) ends up in jail pertaining to a variety of unfortunate circumstances, the pace dramatically slows down and allows time for the characters to be more memorable.  The writing improves too.  I even feel emotional when the moment calls for it, and the laughs get better too.  The movie writer who worked on the comedy did a poor job, but the writer who focused on the emotional side did a decent job.  Also I enjoyed the characters of the British taxi driver with a bad attitude, the clueless tattoo worker and the tall biker dude who actually delivers an emotional and memorable scene near the end when the one woman breaks down and convinces herself that she's a bad mother.

So basically the first half is total filler while the second half is an improvement.  I can't recommend Moms' Night Out due to so many problems.  The writing is way too similar to a romantic comedy which makes it hard to find anything funny about it, the writing doesn't stand out until it's almost too late, and it's just not very good.  Patricia Heaton is a good character as one would expect given her experience in other memorable roles (like yeah, Everybody Loves Raymond) but everyone else?  Completely forgettable.  You can't have the entire cast of main characters awful with the exception of one person.  I say only watch if you're having trouble finding something else.",1420675200,,4951,4.751756440281031

Very good family movie.  I think made geared more towards Christian families but I think any family looking for a good movie without language, violence, or suggestive material, will enjoy this very much.

This movie has something for the whole family with funny moments with the mother's, how us father's sometimes are in over our heads, and how our kids really are a full time job.

Nice cast of actors,Sarah Drew from ""Greys Anatomy"", Sean Austin from ""Rudy"" and ""The Lord of The Rings"", Patricia Heaton from ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" and ""The Middle"" and also Country music star Trace Adkins, really do a great job playing their respective parts.

6405987,4,B00K80QGCS,"As christian entertainment, I found it great.  As entertainment, I thought it was cute.  There is are two or three moments that made the whole movie worth it for me.  One is a breakdown, where mom is lamenting a pair of heels she no longer finds time to wear.  Another that christians will recognize (and love) is a bible study where one lady is thanking God for everything is crazy lady detail.  But my favorite moment is near the end when the least likely guy gives ""mom"" a pep talk that is so sweetly real, it made the entire movie for me.  My preacher even used the moment in a sermon (making him my favorite pastor of all time....well, since college)!",1418601600,,656,4.380165289256198

Fun to have a nice movie you can watch with friends and not have to blush over embarrassing, inappropriate scenes.  True comedy is when you don't have to just push the envelope to be funny.

6406007,4,B00K80QGCS,"I was so pleased with this movie. Truly amusing and enjoyable. So often, previews show the 1 or 2 decent laughs in the whole movie, giving an exaggerated impression of the humor in the entire thing, but not in this case. Very entertaining. A couple of the actors are sub par but do not play leading roles and can easily be overlooked. Additionally, the story line begins to wear a wee bit thin by the time they wrap it up but this is a minor point in a generally well done and entertaining movie. One of the better Christian flicks - and definetly the best Christian comedy I've seen.",1417996800,,584,4.36697247706422

6406012,5,B00K80QGCS,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  My experience is that the humor is appreciated more by women whose children are grown.  In other words, women past the age of these women.  I saw it twice within a week.  This is VERY unusual for me.  I rarely go to see a movie, preferring to wait for it to be on DVD so I can watch it at home.  I not only went to see this; I went twice, each time with a different friend.  I am almost 60 and my children are grown.  Both the friends I saw this with also have grown children.  We laughed hysterically but my daughters in law (who have babies and haven't gotten to this stage of parenthood yet) thought it was funny but were way under impressed, compared to my (and my friends') reaction.  If you have seen children through to adulthood you will probably be prepared for an evening of laughter.  Don't bother to pop corn; you will be laughing too much to eat it.",1417824000,,916,4.1477272727272725

I'm not one that turns movies off without watching the whole thing, but this one was close. It was very dark, depressing, and stressful through much of the movie. The main character acted as though her life was so unhappy and useless. It was a nice attempt at a Christian movie but hard to take in the message with all the chaos. With so many well known actors/actresses I thought the acting would be better, Trace Adkins by far made the movie. Go figure.

6406095,5,B00K80QGCS,"One of the many reasons I loved this movie is because it's been so long since I've been able to watch one, due to the foul language and indecent innuendoes so prevalent in today's movies.  But this movie was slapstick funny; I laughed so hard that my face hurt by the time it was over.  Yes, there was a time or two it was a bit much, but I loved it for the message at the end.  So many times in today's world women who choose to stay home and commit to raising their children are asked why they don't go out and ""get a job.""  Any woman who has worked as a stay-at-home mom (and done it right) works as hard, if not harder, than a woman who gets a check on Friday.
This movie shows a woman who expects too much of herself and how it nearly breaks her spirit.  I also loved that this same woman came to realize she could retire her superwoman cape and how rewarding it was to simply be a wife and mother.  Her husband is a doll with his, ""The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.""
Yes, this is an exaggerated, slapstick, comedy with some finer moments scattered throughout.  You will either love it, or it will get on your nerves.  I love, love, loved it!",1416182400,,1161,4.106194690265487

6406098,1,B00K80QGCS,"I didn't like this movie, which surprised me, as I'd been told it  was excellent & very funny.  It was filmed in too much darkness, which I don't like.  It isn't a movie I would recommend because I never laughed once.  I don't think the way they acted (moms) were funny.  after about 3/4 way thru, I turned it off & watched something else.
That's my opinion on this one!  I enjoy movies & own many hundreds, but sorry I purchased this one!!!!",1416182400,3,442,4.265060240963855

6406102,1,B00K80QGCS,"I know my daughter and i are in the minority based on the reviews but we didn't enjoy this movie.  We found it depressing that a mother of three who has everything could be so unhappy..  She has it all - family, health and love so why is she so unhappy.  I understand she is overwhelmed with motherhood and it does get chaotic when kids are young.  But there is no reason to be so glum..perhaps anti-depressants are needed for this mom in the short term..If you are looking for a feel-good film - About Time (rated r so not for kids), Letters to Juliet, Freaky Friday (original and remake), & Bedtime Stories are films that will leave you with sweet thoughts and some tears of happiness too!  However, if you are seeking a film where faith contains the answer then this film is for you.",1416182400,5,786,4.3561643835616435

6406119,5,B00K80QGCS,"A lighthearted and comedic drama, at times hilarious, (for the whole family) about a mother hassled to the point of needing a break. The night out doesn't go as planned and that's the simple story. This is the first movie in my memory where Sean Astin had a supporting role that wasn't clownish and showed he could act; he is the supportive husband and one of few straight roles in this comedy. Patricia Heaton one of a handful of Christian actors appearing in this movie is the Mom's Mom who is involved in the night out as is country music star Trace Adkins. I didn't find this movie strong on Gospel message, but all the people portrayed were Christians in this movie and Christian ethics, forgiveness, friendship, support, and repentance are there if you look. Maybe Trace was playing an good-natured wannabe (who is also a life-size biker right down to the tats, wallet chain, sleeves missing jacket. and Harley), you be the judge. Don't go to see this to see the Gospel, go to see it for a non-offensive and funny timeout from the cares of this world. Go to see it to encourage Hollywood to make more family friendly comedies, dramas, adventures, romances, etc.",1415664000,,1167,4.669902912621359

My husband didn't want to see it because he thought it would be a ""chick flick"".  My son took me to see it for Mother's Day and we were rolling on the floor laughing.  We couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so the rest of the family could watch it.  We were watching it when my husband and dad came in the room.  Both sat down to watch.  Within minutes, they were both belly laughing.  Trace Adkins and Patricia Heaton are hysterical.  Most importantly, though, is the sweet family relationships presented and the message about how important mothers are to a family.  I loved this movie!",1415232000,,722,4.32089552238806

There are parts of the movie where you will laugh out loud as you identify with the family portrayed in the movie. The grow ups and the kids play their roles to perfection. Some positive life lessons taught concerning doing the right thing.,1414454400,,348,4.629032258064516

It is not a chick film, it is for all. Super casting, the guys are idiots and will keep you in sticthes, as well as the women. It is family night super fun, so put on the popcorn, get your drinks, (no alcohol) and kick back and be prepared to be entertained and laugh out loud at this incredible bunch of people. Sean Aston, Patricia Heaton, (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Trace Adkins, the biker will tickle you to death.",1414368000,,585,4.140350877192983

Can't I just watch another fairy tale that takes me out of my life?...it's a tad exaggerated for some humor and extra stress...most mom's can probably identify with the mom's in the movie so in that case it was funny at times.

6406223,5,B00K80QGCS,"This movie was not only funny but refreshing and light hearted.  So many people have been reviewing the movie as if Christians are meant to be boring and that for every single thing we encounter in life, that we always run to God.  Let's be real for a moment...there are going to be times (especially in parenting) where we are going to be having a ""moment"" and don't sit down to our Bibles and pray for peace.  Parenting is HARD and sometimes we just need a break from the ""job"" without all the condescending ""you should be going to God"" lines.  We are human...we need REALITY. And sometimes that reality is simply getting away from the kids with friends, a spouse, or alone.

Anyhow, back to the movie...lots of good laughter from both my husband and I as the movie is so relatable.  I also had some good laughs with the pastor's wife and daughter relationship because I'm a pastor's kid and totally understand.

6406233,1,B00K80QGCS,"This movie had almost every bad element in it: drugs, alcohol, sexual suggestion, the parents who can't handle their kids and don't turn to God for help, immature men gaming, unwed mother, baby left in unsafe situation, loud rock/dance music, violence, main characters dancing to loud music in bowling alley, the pastor's wife who went wild at Woodstock reunion and has secret tattoos that the biker dude somehow got to see, the biker dude who walked away from God but knows God loves him for just being him, the biker dude telling the frazzled mom to just be herself because that is how God made her, mommy blogging instead of praying or reading her Bible, the women all acting like idiots with their phones, and the list goes on.

We felt comfortable buying this for the family because we saw Alex Kendrick was involved in it, along with some of the co-stars of his previous films.  He has made some excellent Christian movies that were wholesome and encouraging.  I can't understand how they could sell out and appear in such a shameful movie.  David White and Pureflix have really suckered Christians into buying a lot of junk movies that push ungodly things.

6406276,5,B00K80QGCS,"I am normally a Christian book and movie snob.  There are very few that appeal to me due to poor quality, stereotyping, and/or cheesyness, so I did not have high hopes for this one.  I only watched it because many friends had recommended it so my kids really wanted to and, if it was cheesy or preachy, well at least it wasn't inappropriate for a family afternoon activity.

I was totally impressed.  I see this movie as SUCH an improvement on all the above things I normally find in Christian books and movies (including others these same folks have made like Courageous, Fireproof - don't even get me started).  The characters were multi-dimensional, there was non-stereotypical diversity, the message wasn't a quick fix all, hey, even the men weren't bumbling idiots or ones who needed to be told to ""man up"" over and over and over and over again in a guilt-inducing odyssey of religiosity.  Everyone had their flaws and strengths and not everything got nicely resolved in the end (for instance the dad who has to travel and work too much doesn't suddenly get a dream job in ministry).  Sure it was predictable in many parts, but not for my kids who were ROLLING laughing and crying right along with me all the way through it.  Now, when my husband gets home (from the job he has to work/travel too much for) we'll see what he thinks, but hey, the fact that I feel able to recommend it to him is huge as he can be a bigger snob than me about this stuff!

I read a 1 star review stating that the parents in the movie were too permissive with their kids.  As a strict mom to 5 who are 5 1/2 years apart in total and therefore who has ""been through it all,"" there were a few things I have issue with from the movie (violent video games) but even that fact that I do, I think, is great as it shows, hey, there isn't one perfect way to parent - God will NOT strike us dead if we don't get every little thing right.  Most of the crazy things the kids do in the movie seem linked not to the parents' permissiveness but rather personality and developmental stages of their characters - in other words - very normal.  And I think I had at least 80% of the things that happened in the movie in the kid arena happen with my own in one way or another, in one point in time or another (not all in one night, of course).",1413676800,,2309,4.2827586206896555

6406280,5,B00K80QGCS,"This is the funniest movie I have seen in many, many years.  It's clean, wholesome, witty, profound, sensitive and uplifiting.  There's a spiritual message without being gooey and sappy. It portrays married couples in healthy relationships, with the stresses and joys that are involved.  It's over the top--many customer reviewers said that--but the point is....it's supposed to be over the top.  The underlying frustrations, joys, emotions and predicaments that are portrayed in the film are all real and every single mom or dad since the beginning of time has had to deal with one or all of them to some degree or another.

The first time I saw the film was in the theater with a good friend.  We laughed until we cried several times.  Then when we were reminded about God's love and plan for us we cried again.  The second time I saw it, I laughed out loud again.  The third time I saw it I was watching it on an overseas plane ride and as much as I tried not to laugh out loud, I did.  The woman next to me finally asked me what film I was watching...

Alex Kendrick, Kevin Downes & Rob Amaya (co-directors of ""Courageous""), play major roles in this movie.

And the lead actress isn't really the best, in my opinion, but, as a stay-at-home mom to four who was in the middle of her own emotional breakdown, I could certainly relate! And, though cheesy in parts, it did make me legitimately laugh out loud - a lot. I enjoy that the humor was appropriate, clean and actually funny.

6406300,5,B00K80QGCS,"I finally got to see this movie this past weekend, and I have to say, it was worth every moment of the wait.

Three moms try to take a much-needed night out and it turns into a total comedy of errors. Realistic? Not really. But this is totally laugh out loud funny (even my boys were literally rolling on the ground). If you are a mom, you will recognize yourself in these women at least a little bit. You'll laugh and maybe even cry a little. At the very least, it will be a family-friendly couple of hours, perfect for a family movie night with pre-teen or older kids.

My favorite line from the movie: One of the women is a mommy blogger and she writes ""I'm a mess, but I'm a beautiful mess!"" Aren't we all :)",1413244800,3,712,4.1521739130434785

6406310,1,B00K80QGCS,What a horrible movie.  It is everything a Christian family ought not to be.  From children who are absolutely untamed to adults who are equally untamed.  It made me nervous just trying to watch about 15 minutes.  Not the least bit funny.,1413244800,3,238,4.595238095238095
6406311,5,B00K80QGCS,"Our whole family loved this movie.  This is truly a good, clean comedy.  It is not very often that I find a comedy that I will let my girls watch, as a lot of comedy these days is not appropriate by my standards.  So we honestly do not watch a lot of movies.  I was not sure if my girls would relate well to this movie  as they are 7, 13 and 14, and have never had those stressful days that only a Mom can understand.  But they loved it and laughed along with the whole family.  They have watched it 3 times already and are constantly quoting the movie.  My girls also loved the commentary about the movie. They are aspiring film makers, and the Erwin brothers reveal a few screen writing tips throughout the commentary.  They also give fun background information on some of the shots and let you know how much improv is in the movie.  So the extras are a nice addition.
From a Mom viewpoint, I loved it as well.  I have been a stay at home mom who had a husband travel 3 out of the 4 weeks while our older girls were little.  So I could relate all too well with the main character.  And I remember my husband being nervous when I would first leave our girls with him.  Obviously not to the extent they portray in the movie.  But the exaggerations make it that more funny as most parents and moms can relate to some of the things that happen during the movie.
Thank you Erwin Brothers, Andrea Nesfall, all the actors/actresses in the film, and everyone else associated with this film.  It was wonderful to have a movie that my whole family could enjoy!  And thank you for honoring all the mothers who work so hard to raise their families.  The message of your movie was uplifting and a much needed encouragement to all the women in our country.",1413158400,,1744,4.249240121580547

I had an entirely different movie in mind when she described it. We had no idea what we were getting into when we clicked play. At first, we thought, ""Okay, this is interesting"" (as in ready to hit stop and pop in an action movie) but by the end of the movie we all were laughing with tears in our eyes. It is definitely a slapstick, feel good, crazy, totally fictional, no way it's going to happen in real life movie. It's good clean family fun perfectly fine for everyone. Our teens (13-16) laughed right along with us. Definitely a must see, must buy, must share movie! Yes, it does have a religious theme, but it isn't in your face. It definitely celebrates motherhood - although as I said before, it blows it to the extremes. (Which is why it's so freaking funny!) I rate this movie up with ""Almost Heroes"", ""Dodgeball"", ""Out Cold"", ""R.V."", ""Old Dogs"" and ""Wild Hogs"" -- although without the adult content.",1412812800,,1051,4.450777202072539

Being a mom of 4 busy children I was able to identify with the work it takes to keep a house clean and finding enjoyment in all the kids craziness. Like putting the picture frames around the drawings on the wall instead blowing up and finding the inter thoughts of the child. Motherhood is such an amazing journey.

6406424,1,B00K80QGCS,The movie is TERRIBLE. This movie was no doubt funded by some religious group. It would have been nice if this fact had been mentioned somewhere in the trailer or the written narrative beforehand.

I am a stay-at-home mom and thought I would relate, but I would say the only redeeming quality of this movie is that Sean Astin is in it and seeing his face brought back pleasant ""Goonies"" memories. Don't even watch this on the airplane when you have nothing better to do.",1411776000,,383,4.1891891891891895

6406456,5,B00K80QGCS,Loved it. My night out watching it was as good as Moms Night Out. I watched it on a plane and it made the hours pass by (to be fair it was a pretty short flight). Having watched an episode of the Walking Dead this was the perfect follow-up. I even forgot about my GI problems presented to me by Turkish Airlines beef option. The plot is simple but effective - it's essentially a sequel to Lord of the Rings whereby Sam's wife (the hobbit) is getting a little fed up of their little hobbits (they are pretty small) and just wants a crazy night out in Mordor. I would recommend Moms Night Out to moms who want a night out.... and other people.,1411689600,,641,4.17741935483871

6406476,5,B00K80QGCS,"A lot of fun.  Totally related to the main Mom character - we are too hard on ourselves (at least I am).  It was an exaggerated, absurd, yet not totally far fetched crazy day in the life of a Mom & her complete, major fail in a night out that was definitely wildly exaggerated, but relatable in the some things that occurred - esp. the snooty restaurant scene.  Overall fun & heartwarming - really enjoyed it!",1411430400,,409,4.355263157894737

6406501,5,B00K80QGCS,"Something a bit different... this is a hilarious comedy that is unabashedly Christian in its outlook. Therefore, predictably, the professional critics do not like it...but it has a solid audience rating of 84% and has become a highly profitable film for its producers. Sarah Drew (who you will recognize if you watch much TV) is Allyson, the addled mother of three very active children. She is married to Sean, played by Sean Astin, who most of you will recognize as Sam in the ""LOTR"" trilogy. Sean agrees to keep his kids and a friend's kid while Ally and two of her friends have a moms' night out to unwind. One of the friends is her pastor's wife, played by Patricia Heaton; the other is played by Logan White, who I also recognized from TV. Teaming up with Sean's sister, played by Abbie Cobb, the night out turns into a comedy of errors and pratfalls, reminiscent of some of the best screwball comedies of old. In the midst of all the quirky moments of comedy, the film also has moments of deep truth about what it is like to have those ""mommie moments"" when they feel like a total out of control mess. It addresses the sense of failure moms with young kids and teenagers often have. All of these life lessons are wrapped around goofy humor that will have you laughing out loud on a regular and recurring basis. Trace Adkins has a featured role and actually has some of the funniest and most poignant lines toward the end of the film. The producer of several other faith based films, Alex Kendrick, appears in this as the pastor; and David Hunt (Patricia Heaton's husband) is the cabbie. I know this movie will have you laughing...hopefully it will make you think too!",1411344000,,1673,4.561461794019934

The movie was a total disaster except maybe at the end when family respect was finally restored.  I must say that my wife and I were embarrassed to sit through this movie.

You have to watch like you would a Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse cartoon. No, that probably would not all really happen. But humor often does come out in over exaggeration, because it amplifies truth and makes us laugh at ourselves. That is what this film did for me. My kids have never been that misbehaved nor my house that messy, as the main character's, but still I laughed because some days do feel like her bad days. Also the message was sweet, that we moms do feel that we are responsible for everything, and we need reminding that we matter and are doing a good job, even in our messes.",1411257600,,721,4.428571428571429

There were some funny moments, but towards the end, I found myself wandering away to do other things while listening to the dialogue in the background.  I wish I had read the reviews before renting, as they are the only way to know that this is a faith-based film (unless you are familiar with the filmmakers). It is kind of casually faith-based and not in-your-face.  This is totally fine, it's just not my thing, and honestly, I probably wouldn't have rented it had I known. It was refreshing, however, to make it through a movie without profanity thrown in ever other sentence and multitudes of bodily function jokes.
I think this movie was made for a very specific demographic.  White, middle-class, single-income, church-going Americans.  If you're outside that demographic, maybe skip this one.",1411257600,3,967,4.783132530120482

Yes it is made by a couple of studios that do christian themed movies.  There is 2-3 scenes where the word ""god"" is mentioned.

6406577,1,B00K80QGCS,"Where to begin? Although my husband & I enjoyed some laughs as parents...car chase scene.... The movie left me feeling sad that it is touted as coming from a Christian perspective.  For the woman the movie seemed to suggest that neither her husband nor her Pastors wife nor the church gatherings had any valuable wisdom or godly counsel to help in the frazzled mom's life. Never anywhere that I remember do the Christian people pray....or read the Bible....I thought that God gave us His Word and access to Him thru prayer so that we could live a life guided by Him. He is our Help in times of trouble. His joy is our Strength. This Mom does not really turn to God in my opinion. In fact, her most profound moment seems to come from an ever-so-wise-biker/tattoo shop owner  new friend to just be herself....just be you, he says. (The cliche biker character is the movies take on him...not mine)I think that is what she has been doing-just being herself....now she needs to actively put into practice the awesome principles God has given us in order to glorify Him. Where are the movies that show us God is active and living...and that He has given us a way to live that our own Designer and Creator gave. Sad that this Mom was afraid to leave her children at home with her husband who plays violent video games with his buddy. Sad that the preachers wife finally got her freedom and showed it by dancing at a bar/bowling alley in the end...it seems like the Christians in this film are as shallow and self minded as the world. No difference. They do not even find hope in God....only in themselves... Living as Christians does require us to live differently...God gives us His grace to live right. That IS His grace. When things around us are unsteady we are still called to live His way with a firm resolve that our lives are for His glory and not for our glory. It is a fine line it seems at times but the difference is that we are not looking just to feel good, rather we are looking to be like Christ Who said He did and said only what His Father God said. His 12 exemplified Him as they went on in life....they didn't exemplify the ways of the world any more. So it's not just about being forgiven and living however we want. We now have an example set before us thru Scripture of the Father's great plan. Our love for Him should propel us to look for hoe we can live His way and not the way that just makes us feel good.",1410912000,17,2426,4.3532008830022075

It has the perfect blend for a family movie and there is nothing inappropriate about it.  As one review suggests, the music is not ""christian"" music BUT it wasn't ""Anaconda"" by any means.  You hear worse on the radio and you see worse in commercials.  This movie is wholesome and has a positive message.  I highly recommend it!! I personally thank the producers and actors of this film because it isn't easy making movies for a society addicted to special effects and adrenaline rushes.

This movie I would consider a light type of comedy that has a mom target audience, not that this is a bad thing as even I thought the movie was cute (not great but ok). Although not outrageous or roaring laugh out loud comedy say like Hangover or something similar, this is more of a light hearted, family oriented comedy (rare these days) that tries to have a message as the moms go out on an silly and crazy adventurous night out. The downside is that the plot is very formulaic and flows along predictably and sometimes at least for me, I also thought got a little preachy (not realizing it is a faith based movie as you would call them) with its message and I thought a tad too long and drawn out, story-wise.

Overall though, this movie is an ok, clean comedy that is more silly than laugh out loud but it is ok for what it tries to do. Although not great, a little cheesy and slow at times, (wife liked it a bit more than I did), it is a clean comedy for families watch.",1410652800,4,1153,4.212669683257919

6406622,5,B00K80QGCS,"Proverbs 17:22 ""A merry heart doeth good like a medicine"". My wife and I saw this movie at a nearby church, it was great! as a stressed out, home schooling, pastor's wife, and mother of four, it was just what my wife needed to help her relax and enjoy some time away from the kids.
The movie itself is just down right funny, filled with plenty of good humor and funny situations. While a stressed out, overwhelmed parent probably can't see the humor in the situation very often, the movie producers were able to put it all in a funy light without putting down the mothers who identify with the mothers shown in the movie.
The lead stressed out mother is shown dealing with a messy house, hyper kids (who need a good spanking IMO), and a husband who loves her but can't be there to help like he should due to travel for work. After a horrible mother's day, and some further feeling down comparing herself to a ""perfect"" woman at church, she and her friend hit on the idea of a Mom's night out. They include the Pastor's wife, though I wasn't sure why from the movie plot.
The fathers, while wanting to be helpfull are a little out of their league, and the build up to the moms leaving just adds to the humor.
The three Ladies make their escape, in a minivan with a radio that has a mind and volume of its own, to find the imagined night of grown up conversation and neatness goes off track quickly. The reservation was for the wrong night...
From then on the movie follows the misadventures of the mom's trying to save their night of freedom, the dad's great idea of taking the kids to a fun place, which ends with a trip to the hospital, the mom's ending up with their car stollen, a hunt for a lost baby, a good hearted but clueless taxi driver, a tough biker on a Harley, a car chase, and ultimately with the pastor's wife and mothers in the holding pen of the police department.
This leads to the greatest heart to heart for the stressed out lead mom, leading her to see that she should see herself as God sees her, not how others would make her feel, with the tough Harley rider being the teacher.
The ending was great, you've got to see it to understand it. (the lost baby is found)
Overall the acting was great, none of those stilted conversations or less than believable actors found in most christain films. The humor was not slapstick, but very believable, I know I loved it, and my wife had moments of tears and plenty of laughs.",1410652800,,2439,4.339168490153173

We saw 4.5 stars/ 178 reviews and w/o reading those reviews, rented one of the lamest movies we've ever seen.  We had to shut off 1/2way through once we realized it was a lamb in wolf's clothing.  We laughed harder at the fact that we got duped by a Christian movie, than anything in the movie.  If you're actually a Chrisitan mom that never gets out and really has no clue what a real comedy is, then this is a 5-star movie.  For normal people however - this is pure junk.

How the Lord of the Rings co-star was duped into this weak, Christian-Rock comedy I have no clue.  Like Christian rock poses as the real thing, this movie poses as a real comedy.  It is weak from the start with community-theater level over-acting, by mostly amateurs, and the plot is as thinner than paper.  PASS THIS ONE UP.  How a few well-known actors ended up in this out-date-as-the-Bible script is confusing.

Big surprises were Trace Adkins as a biker tatoo artist and a new classic cameo from the dizzy, tattoo parlor front-desk guy: right up there with Sean Penn's surfer dude. Bravo!

6406667,5,B00K80QGCS,"It is rare to find a movie that will make you laugh so hard that you find yourself scrambling for the remote. Not so that you can fast forward to get away from the movie but because you were laughing so hard that you missed something else and now have to rewind to catch that joke as well. It's a good thing and so is the movie MOM'S NIGHT OUT.

Allyson (Sarah Drew) is a part time blogger/full time mother trying to wrangle three pre-school children at home. Her husband Sean (Sean Astin) is an architect who tries to help when he is home but more often than not is out and about working or taking guy time out with his friend Kevin. Needless to say Sarah's stress level is about to explode.

Allyson's best friends are Izzy (Andrea Logan White) and Sondra (Patricia Heaton). Izzy is Sarah's age with two kids of her own and a husband with a fear of children. Sondra is the oldest of the three, the wife of the pastor of their church and dealing with her own child, not pre-school mind you but the next step of aggravation, a teenager. When Allyson has had enough she suggests they have a night out, just the three of them. With a coupon at the local high class restaurant plans are made.

Things start to go wrong when Sean's half sister Bridget (Abbie Cobb) comes to dinner and asks Allyson to watch her baby while she starts a new job that same night. Allyson turns her down but Sean steps in, learning for the first time about the girl's night out, and says he'll baby sit. He wants Allyson to go out, to unwind and to have a good time. He appreciates her and all she does believing more in her success than she does.

All seems fine right? That is until it all starts to unravel beginning with their reservation messed up. Mix that with ever ringing cell phones from husbands who can't seem to deal with the same things these women do every day and it gets worse. I'm not talking about worse because of the cell phones either. By the end we have babies in tattoo parlors, stolen vehicles, bikers, cops, waste heads and children with the uncanny ability to find a way to get into trouble at the local pizza and gaming establishment. And that's just a few things that happen.

The energy if frenetic in this film and never seems to let up. Something seems to constantly be happening here. Each opportunity to turn one of these negative things into something funny is taken and it works each and every time. But more than that the movie also provides an opportunity to bring about a message about faith, about God and about mother's deserving praise non-stop. It becomes something that offers a positive message among the chaos that begins in the first moments and runs through till almost the last image.

If you have children, or if you have relatives with children, you'll certainly relate to so much that happens in this movie. Perhaps not the same circumstances but at least the same sort of minor life explosions that come with having children. At the same time you'll be reminded that children are a blessing and that even some of the worst things they seem to do can turn around to be amazing displays of creativity and affection.

As I said when beginning this review to find a movie that is laugh out loud funny from start to finish these days is rare indeed. When you can find one that is inspiring as well it makes it even more special. I know that MOM'S NIGHT OUT will find a comfortable space in my collection to be watched every now and then when I need to do two things: to have a laugh and to be reminded how great mothers are. My guess is you'll want to do the same after watching it the first time.",1410393600,,3620,4.369985141158989

I know some mom's that feel this way and like they are alone so it was just fun to relate using comedy.

6406682,5,B00K80QGCS,"I finally got to watch Moms Night Out! I wanted to see this when it was in the theaters, but didn't get a chance to. I had heard great things about the movie and I really enjoyed it! I had the opportunity to review the book and I was disappointed because there were some elements that seemed really far fetched to me. That said, I did think the movie would be better than the book because I felt the dynamics of it being played out on a screen would be more enjoyable than reading about it. I was right.

While the movie did have elements that I felt were far fetched, I actually enjoyed them and found myself laughing at many of them. I think the actors did a great job bringing this movie to life. I recognized a few of the actors from Fireproof and I really enjoyed this film.

This movie also reminded me of how important the job of a mom is. I know there are many times when mothers don't feel appreciated for all they do and I know there are times when it may seem like they are not getting much done. This movie reminded me of the crazy role a mother has. It made me appreciate my mom even more!

I really enjoyed the clips during the credits as I found myself cracking up watching them as well. It was nice getting to watch a clean comedy with some valuable takeaway lessons. I think many groups and couples will enjoy having a night out and watching this movie together.

6406685,5,B00K80QGCS,"Outrageously funny.  The first 10 to 15 minuets are spent explaining the roles of a fairly large cast and your patience will be well rewarded as this movie turns into a Nantucket Sleigh Ride of comedy.  Sometimes you haven't finished with the humor of one scene till the director hits you with another salvo.  A couple times I caught myself considering the double verticals of the pause button on my DVD player's remote.  No ""A"" list-ers but whom ever made the cast selections and producer Kevin Downes deserve a big ""JOB WELL DONE!  Kevin brought out the best in everyone.

6406733,1,B00K80QGCS,"I bought this movie based on positive reviews. I am only reviewing this so that others won't be duped by the positive reviews like I was. My review will contain spoilers, so if that's an issue for you, you might not want to read further.

There is nothing redeeming about this movie. If it's supposed to appeal to a Christian audience, there were several offensive factors. First of all, there' s a song with a chorus of ""I'm walking on water"" (a blasphemous reference to Christ because it was depicting mothers, one who falls off her high heeled shoes). Then there is a reference to Amy Grant, as though she and her music is wholesome. Men were depicted as buffoons and incompetent, while women were depicted as hyper, emotional, and also incompetent. Stereotypes, stereotypes, stereotypes.

Now if the movie is supposed to be appeal to families, well, let's just say that's offensive in itself. The writing was juvenile, the acting was bad (despite having some competent actors on board), and the plot was simplistic and underdeveloped. Most of the 99 minutes was filled with a screaming, hyper woman who was decidedly unfunny, or bad, over-the-top slapstick. I would deem even the youngest child too sophisticated (hopefully) to fall for this stuff, and it was painstakingly bad and boring for an adult to have to sit through.

I was very disappointed that one of the Kendrick brothers took part in this movie. It also had some cast members from his other movies, which was equally disappointing. Based on their involvement in this flick, I've been left to conclude that Alex Kendrick has jumped the shark, and I'll probably be skipping his next movie.

I'm guessing that this movie was an attempt to be the woman's answer to Courageous, but it falls flat. Was it supposed to be a comedy? Have a serious message? Perhaps a little of both, but the movie was so confused and the script so disjointed, that the viewer is left with mixed messages and the unsettling feeling that he/she'd just wasted 99 precious minutes. Definitely NOT recommended.",1410134400,10,2047,4.84

6406737,2,B00K80QGCS,"Nice try  A for effort. C for Christianity.  Basically this is a Christian feel-good movie made for stay-at-home moms and children.  In it we are reminded that men rule the household, and faith in God being there--not doing anything--just being around, gets us through the darkest of diaper days.  Men are laughably bad at taking care of children.  They need to be the bread winners.  So, you women staying at home, locked away in a Christian fundamentalist prison should be joyful.  It's all worth it.  Why?  Because those who birth the children change the world.  Really?  Not sure if you saw what is going on in Ferguson or Uganda or the Mexican border, etc.  Maybe those moms need to be locked up.

The actresses are great.  Always dressed appropriately too.  Nice long skirts.  (Still, the main mom is pretty hot.)  Trace Adkins is a great actor too.  Can't wait to see him in some serious action movies.  Everybody else is just ok.

Anyway, the movie is ""cute.""  At best.  Cute.  It's comedy is lame.  Based mostly on Christian lifestyle practices.  Oh, she was caught holding beer on camera!  Naughty!  Giggle!  Oh, those people have tattoos!  And the moms have to interact with them!  Naughty!  Giggle!  That mom made noise in church!  Naughty!  Giggle!  Oh, the women are texting during a prayer meeting!  Naughty!  Giggle giggle giggle.  The older woman in church is a sassy source of advice who once sinned and got a tattoo!  Oh how naughty!  Giggle Giggle!

The pastor has ""connections"" throughout the community, so he can commandeer a police force and a biker gang to look for a baby.  Yeah . . . right.  How much self praise can this movie engage in?  It is a film about the Christian community for the Christian community, stapled with intermittent lessons of faith that the characters vomit every once in a while.

The characters by themselves were good enough to carry a movie, if the writers had gone for some serious adult comedy.  Instead it is a movie about faith more than it is a laugh-fest.  Bor-ring.

There ARE however about five laugh-out-loud funny parts and a fun car chase.  Done well.

NOT RECOMMENDED.  Unless you are Christian and need a tame movie night.",1410048000,,2188,4.701333333333333

6406740,5,B00K80QGCS,"I smoke, drink, and cuss more than I would like to admit.  I also attend Mass faithfully every Sunday and my faith is as much a part of my identity as my vices.  Why I mention this is the elites think the film's characters as being from Mars with their abidance to religion being something out of the norm. Today the only place you would find religion treated with any kind of reverence is on ""The Simpsons"".  If you watched a film from Hollywood's Golden Age characters were routinely attending church services and there wouldn't be a second thought about it.  Why I mention this is religion in this film isn't so much incidental to the story but part of its fabric.  The main plot is nothing special kind of like an extended episode of ""I Love Lucy"", ""Laverne and Shirley"" or,  if I must because of Patricia Heaton's presence in the cast, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".  What distinguishes the film after all the dust clears and the hijinks are completed is the message that motherhood is a vocation from God as important as a call to the ministry.  It's ironic that the message is delivered most succinctly by an agnostic biker type played by Trace Adkins who is quite good here.  Props also to Sarah Drew who plays Ally, a young wife and mother who is experiencing feelings of inadequacy in those roles.  Drew is quite good in charting Ally's evolution as a person through the course of the film.  Yes, this is a faith based venture and denying it  does the film a disservice.  That said women of all backgrounds can draw some valuable life lessons from this endeavor.",1410048000,,1568,4.557142857142857

Possibilities for a future movie done by this same group: include a child with emotional or physical disabilities.  Or a mom with disabilities . . . Don't show everyone owning large, beautiful homes with only one wage earner; it assumes prosperity that escapes most people.  Have a person of color as one of the main characters . . . A family of color with a home culture that is not the same as everyone else's, yet is a wonderful Christian family? . . . How about a family with two parents who have to work, most of us do . . . I know this is sounding very politically correct, but that's not my intention.  I applaud your efforts to make a funny movie that isn't vulgar and I am pleased you were able to partner with TriStar pictures to make this movie.  If you want to make it really funny and attract a broader audience these are just a few ideas.  One more  . . . . include foster parents . . . . who are my heroes.

This movie was actually funny with wonderful acting and real situations. I had a friend call in that her car was stolen because her husband traded cars.

6406782,5,B00K80QGCS,"This film is one of the most creative ones that has come out lately. I don't mean ""the main plot"" is the most creative -- plots are supposed to be simple. What I mean is that the writers did an excellent job weaving in details from the beginning that seemed peripheral throughout the rest of the film so that it was non-stop familiarity. Brilliant.

This film has a specifically Christian message, which is the backdrop meant to envelop the main story line. However, this is not a ""Christian movie"" -- that is, it's not a religious genre. It's a family movie with religious undertones.

Key points:
1. The first 30 minutes or so set up most of the details that come in for the rest of the film. This part seems a bit slow, but it comes to fruition in a redeeming way.

2. Remember, this movie came out on a ""Mother's Day"", which reveals the target audience. Young mothers and families in general will be able to relate. It's kid-friendly for those of you who have kids of any age joining you for the film.

3. The strength of this movie comes from its creativity. It's not a special-effects feature, but one that you're supposed to be able to identify with the characters. The single guy who still plays video games and watches ""300"" or ""Sin City"" will probably not enjoy this film.

In summation, this movie is cleverly made and family friendly. It undergirds the main story line with an overarching purpose. It deals with real-life struggles and issues, and attempts to highlight the humor and importance of people-related (specifically, parent-related), situations.",1409702400,3,1568,4.708029197080292

A lot of cheesy humor and form and there's nothing here that would ever make me want to watch this again.  [SPOILER]  The mom herself didn't even actually get a night out.  She just had to continue living a very stressful life and feel okay about it through faith and basically give up on ever being able to enjoy an actual night out to relax or decompress.  Even though it had an okay message, I ended just feeling bad for the mom and almost an additional stress to my own life of anxiety.  As though a night to decompress or relax is a pipe dream and you should simply give up on it and move on in faith.

They also played it quite safe on any topics of conflict within faith.  So there was nothing to even bring up a healthy discussion or argument about.  The movie is simply there.  Not much to it.  If you're a woman of faith who's a mom, this may speak to you better, but otherwise, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone.",1408233600,7,1172,4.151111111111111
6406797,5,B00K80QGCS,This is a great comedy. Sit with your family and lots of popcorn. You can't go wrong.,1407974400,,85,4.0588235294117645
6406798,5,B00K80QGCS,"I very rarely go to a movie these days.  I don't want to see something ""ripped from today's headlines"" - isn't the world news depressing enough without making films about it?  And today's so-called comedies are crass, childish and vulgar.  If I exchange my hard-earned cash for a ticket stub, I want to be entertained and walk out feeling light-hearted.  So, when I heard about Mom's Night Out, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We laughed so much it would have been embarrassing except that everyone else in the theater was laughing too.  The humor was witty and the actors were all terrific in their roles.  Thoroughly entertaining!",1407715200,2,644,4.696428571428571
6406799,5,B00K80QGCS,I have seen a lot of movies in my lifetime.  I have NEVER laughed as much in one movie as I did this movie.  Very funny.  Very clean.  We loved it.,1407542400,2,147,3.6451612903225805
6406800,5,B00K80QGCS,"I read several negative reviews (such as in USA Today) from critics when this movie came out, but I went to see it anyway.  I know that  if the critics don't like it, I likely will, especially if it's a ""clean"" movie!  My friend and I laughed out loud many times!  It was a great, heartwarming, funny, sweet movie.  I enjoyed it so much, I paid to go see it again and take my three nieces with me.  I enjoyed it even more the second time around.  Many of my friends have also gone to see it more than once.  Not sure what the critic(s) was watching or looking for unless he/she was complaining about the absence of foul language and sexual content!  The script, the characters, the actors, the message -- all great!  I loved it!  I am just waiting for the DVD to become available so I can see it again!",1406246400,12,802,4.176470588235294
6406801,5,B00K80QGCS,"Loved this movie in theaters and will definitely be buying on DVD (which I don't do often!). From the beginning of the movie I kept saying ""that could be me!"" Very relatable, great message in the end. Uplifting and hilarious. Every mom needs to see this (and dad's too I think!)",1406160000,2,278,4.470588235294118
6406802,5,B00K80QGCS,"I loved this movie, and am so anxious to see it again with the DVD!  It's so funny, uplifting, encouraging...it's cliche perhaps, but if you're a mom in the trenches, this is a definite ""feel good"" movie.  Consider it a pep talk for moms, with a little crying and a lot of laughing.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up :)",1405987200,2,313,4.362068965517241

Everyone we were with, men and women ... single, married, with or without kids, enjoyed a very funny movie! Entertaining!  Clean. Classy. Well done!!  I especially thought Sarah Drew was amazing in her role!",1405900800,2,334,4.741379310344827
6406805,5,B00K80QGCS,"So refreshing to see a movie make fun of the humor of family life and support mothers without bashing men!  I was really afraid at first when I took my husband to see it that it would man bash (stupid men can't do anything, women have to do it all and clean up the men's messes, etc.).  We both loved it and put it on our must buy list.  Not often that we both agree on a movie.",1405728000,49,378,3.8205128205128207

Awesome movie!  The type that when you walk out of the theater you know you will be buying it on DVD.  Laugh out loud till you cry movie!  Every mother will relate to this movie in one way or another.",1405123200,8,365,4.056338028169014

6406808,5,B00K80QGCS,"LAUGHED OUT LOUD!  I have seen this movie twice so far....plan to take others and go again!  It is laugh out loud funny without crass, demeaning humor.  I have found myself saying some of the lines in the midst of my day - stress-paralyzed- is one of many.  The traffic scene will have you rolling.  I was a bit nervous when as it started the film stopped and animation was overlayed, but it works.  Ally is introducing us to the characters.....great movie for all who just need a good rip-roaring laugh and a dose of hope.",1404518400,32,523,4.395833333333333
6406809,5,B00K80QGCS,"If you just have to have popcorn, buy the smallest amount because once this movie gets rolling, you will spill the bucket while laughing!

I enjoyed the creative editing as the director worked in tweets, blogs, and flashes of video portraying Allyson's over-active imagination.  Allyson's instantaneous, sensational scenarios threatening her family were very recognizable.  In our culture, where we are constantly bombarded with warnings of dangerous foods, travel, activities, etc., it's hard to stay balanced.  This mom is losing it, and we get to laugh out loud instead of agonizing with her.

But it's not just for Moms--my brother told everyone that HE almost lost it during one of the funniest traffic stops in movie history.

Treat yourself!  This is a great night out for YOU!",1404172800,39,784,5.174603174603175
6406810,5,B00K80QGCS,"Mother's Day weekend was horrible for me, stress wise. That Saturday, I decided that I needed to leave and re-energize and see something. So my fellow frustrated mommy neighbor and I decided to go and see this - her 16 year old son decided to tag along as well. From the start, the three of us were out loud laughing at everything. Most mom movies make things seems like everything is either overly perfect and magical mommy dust is everywhere, or makes things seem like everything is falling apart and there is no blessing in anything. This movie takes the real hard ships, and the blessings and puts them together. There were moments I cried just from the impact of the message. For the most part, though, it was a non stop laugh fest. A true must own!",1403913600,3,754,4.471014492753623

I just wish it would have shown her able to overcome in spite of a still-messy house and kids running around. Besides that, yes, I laughed through my tears most of the movie.
