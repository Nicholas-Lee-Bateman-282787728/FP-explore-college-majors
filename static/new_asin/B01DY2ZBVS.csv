7726075,1,B01DY2ZBVS,"My kids and I have been to multiple Winterjams and they advertised  this video there as if it were a concert.  There are only a few songs interspersed throughout and most of the 2016 performers such a Lauren Daigle, Crowder, Mathew West, Stars Go Dim, We Are Messengers and Red are in the credits however they are never shown performing.  As other reviewers have said this is a big disappointment.

They should not have advertised it as a night at WinterJam more like an infomercial for WinterJam.",1466812800,7,497,4.67816091954023

8757243,5,B01DY2ZBVS,"I just got thru watching the dvd. To be honest I almost didn't get it because of some of the reviews. I think it's an awesome dvd. Cool backstage footage, interviews and stories behind Winter Jam. Also, it had a good amount of full song concert footage placed in between the other footage, much more than I anticipated. Not for every band, but that was expected, otherwise it would be a 4 hour dvd. Highly recommended for anyone a fan of Winter Jam and the bands that have participated.",1490486400,,486,4.47191011235955
