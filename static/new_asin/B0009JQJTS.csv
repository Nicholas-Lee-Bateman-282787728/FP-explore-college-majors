Beefcake Paul falls for slutty blond who is too clingy to begin with, and the rest goes downhill from there. If you feel the need to watch this movie...get the Msytery Science theatre 3000 version. Mike and the bots dutifully chainsaw this abomination to pieces! The tagline for this movie is KAthy the blonde utter ""Moonrock?!! Oh wow!!!""",1179792000,8,465,4.482352941176471
2725684,2,B0009JQJTS,"IN A NUTSHELL: RICK BAKER HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR 10 OSCARS FOR 'MAKE-UP' & SPECIAL EFFECTS'

There is one good thing about the 1976 B-CREATURE FEATURE 'TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST' -- RICK BAKER'S, BIG LIZARD MONSTER SUIT!

WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: TYPICAL LOW-BUDGET CREATURE FEATURE FROM THE 70s

Essentially, a man gets hit in the head by a meteor and becomes a kind of cosmic werewolf that resembles a cross between a primate and a monitor lizard. Though it is a slow moving flick it does eventually reveal itself as campy creature feature. 'Track of the Moon Beast' has the feel of a Kolchak the Night Stalker episode minus Kolchak.

BOTTOM LINE: THIS FILM IS NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD WITH 'SNOWBEAST' & 'CREATURE'

This is NOT a good film, but it admirably avoids the usual cheesy excessive violence and gratuitous sex making it watchable at least. If you enjoy cheesy, campy, creature-features this is a film you may want to see -- once!",1160784000,2,1262,4.65296803652968

If I had known about this one movie I would have won. On second thought, it is so-o-o-o bad it would not win either! It has a bad script, bad story, bad acting, bad props, bad special effects, etc. It is so bad you cannot even find one humorous bad scene; it is just a bad movie.

2725692,5,B0009JQJTS,"When a meteorite -resembling a flaming marshmallow- explodes, sending fragments into Earth's atmosphere, strange occurrences begin. Anthropologist, Paul G. Carlson (Chase Cordell) is out in the desert w/ his latest lady friend, Kathy, when he discovers one of the glowing, pulsating, humming (!) fragments. Obviously, the best thing to do is to pick it up bare-handed, and take it home. Once there, Paul introduces his new girlfriend to his pet lizard (!!) Meanwhile, Paul's colleague, Professor Johnny ""Longbow"" Salinas (Gregorio Sala) philosophizes eloquently to his students about god-knows-what. Soon, a drippy soft-rock band appears to play their newest ""hit"". Johnny ""Longbow"" drones on about Paul's ""loner"" status. Kathy frets. Oh no! Paul starts panting and grunting, right in front of his lizard! Soon, a lovely drunken couple is attacked by a growling, slobbering whatsit! Bloody mutilations ensue. The police are on the case, w/ Johnny ""Longbow"" called in to consult. Will anyone figure out that Paul is becoming a mutant, or will he just have to kill everyone? TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST is hyper-schlock at its most brilliantly painful. Idiot dialogue, petrified ""acting"", and 70s ambiance combine to form a triad of perfect absurdity! Watch for the awesome ""camper-dismemberment"" sequence! Use caution though, as cinematic offal of this magnitude and density could cause dizziness, hives, or even death!

2725695,2,B0009JQJTS,"In pursuit of films featuring people turning into monsters, I will watch most anything (at least once).  And because filmmakers today have long neglected this genre, I'm forced to scrape the bottom of the barrel in hopes of finding a hidden gem.  This, however, is not one of those.  This is a flightless turkey that should have ended up in someone's stew.

The plot features a mineralogist (Chase Cordell) who seems incapable of keeping his shirt on, getting bopped in the head with a `lunar' meteorite.  A fragment of said meteorite lodges deep in his brain (they had to produce several X-rays to prove that).  Every time the full moon comes out, he morphs into a giant lizard.  He starts killing people left and right.  Naturally, the medical community is quick to offer aide and comfort to the killer until they realize the meteorite has disintegrated.  Thank goodness someone remembers a Native American legend concerning the exact same thing happening eons ago.  Not to worry, they expect him to self-combust at any moment.....barring a friend shooting him first with an arrow tipped with part of the original meteorite.

Gosh, it's amazing the things people will put on film and expect other people to watch.  This horror flick has very little going for it except the scene where the mineralogist wakes up in a hospital wearing polka dot PJs for pity sake!  Otherwise, all the performances are painfully awkward and unnatural.  The dialog is hilarious but it's not supposed to be.  The camera work is static.  The monster looks like a guy in a lizard suit.  They even tossed in a musical interlude that they refused to interrupt while they continued with the story.........silently.  I don't even want to talk about the character called Longbow.",1413849600,,1752,4.901360544217687
2725696,1,B0009JQJTS,"The best thing about this movie and possibly the only thing is its hokey plot, which might make it a Masterpiece of Classic Horror/Sci-fi eventually.

2725698,3,B0009JQJTS,"If I saw this movie without knowing it was released in 1976, I would have thought it was older, probably closer to the early 60's.
The plot and the special effects are simple, and to some degree the plot is also predicable once the plot is well established.
It is basically a werewolf movie with a twist that the man turns into a giant lizard instead of a wolf.
The biggest goof in the plot, as far as I'm concerned, was that the main character (the beast) and the female lead meet one day and just one or two days later she is acting like they are deeply in love. Really? They just meet!",1388966400,,588,4.166666666666667

2725700,3,B0009JQJTS,"Not a very good early 70's horror film with attractive leads but bad acting.  The one that comes off the best is the actor that plays the Native American anthropologist who is also the hero.  A young man is zapped by a meteor particle, then doubly zapped by a moon rock.  This leads him to convert to a humanoid lizard monster that goes on a killing rampage whenever the moon is full.  Despite all that I always liked this film.  Not many movies take place in the Albuquerque/Sandia Crest area.  I bought the Movies Unlimited DVD-R version (pictured below) and the quality is pretty good though not perfect.  I don't know if an excellent version will ever be available.",1376870400,,669,4.571428571428571
2725701,2,B0009JQJTS,"Track of the Moon Beast(1976) is a decent, cheesy 1970's science fiction horror film. Mystery Science Theater 3000 brought this movie back into the mainstream in the 1990's. This film portrays a Native American as a hero and it has two attractive leads. Then again, it has clunky dialogue, some poor acting, cheesy special effects and some mean-spirited violent scenes. Country-rock musician Frank Larrabee sings the film's theme song California Lady. The song was released on a 7 inch vinyl single. A minerologist gets hit on the head by a lunar meteorite. The tiny piece of meteorite stuck in his brain transforms him into a killer moon beast during full moons. It's fun hearing Johnny Longbow boast about stew ingredients(""...chicken, corn, green peppers, onions...""). The moon beast's death looks like a funky Buggles music video! There's bad visual effects footage of...flaming toast...flying around the sun! Donna Leigh Drake plays the film's leading lady. She looks hot in short shorts and a pink ""jumpsuit"" . Her screaming sounds like girls at a Beatles concert. Track of the Moon Beast is cheesy 1970's horror that'll keep you entertained for 90 minutes.",1364860800,5,1163,5.158730158730159
2725702,1,B0009JQJTS,"Poor acting, a tired lifeless plot, poor production values, cheesy special effects. Any teenager with an interest in film-making could have produced a much better movie.  Don't waste your money.",1346976000,,194,5.466666666666667
2725703,1,B0009JQJTS,"Concept is familiar -- man turns into a monster, not too different from old werewolf films. But this film has no appeal whatsoever. The writing and the acting are so wooden that it is impossible to care about any of the characters. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's just a boring waste of time. How did something this amateurish ever get OK'd and produced? (On the other hand, it is kind of fun to think about a double-feature pairing ""Track of the Moon Beast"" with 1959's similarly plotted but not as awful ""The Hideous Sun Demon."")",1322784000,2,536,4.536082474226804
2725704,1,B0009JQJTS,"TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST was filmed in 1972 but four years passed before the film found a distributor. There is a reason for that. Now and then a film is bad but amusing or has a strangely goofy charm, with such films as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN cases in point--but most of the time a bad movie is simply that: a bad movie. I fail to see how any one, including the cast crew, ever extracted a nano-second of enjoyment from it.

Briefly, the story concerns archeologist Paul (Chase Cordell, whose chief qualification for the role seems to be that he looks good without a shirt) who hooks up with photographer Kathy (Leigh Drake, whose talent consists miniskirts.) They go for a walk during a meteor show. When a meteor strikes nearby, a tiny bit of rock becomes imbedded in Paul's head. Later, when he goes to a NASA museum, the proximity of a moon rock causes the bit of rock to react in a way that makes Paul turn into a badly costumed monster every full moon night.

I could spend several paragraphs listing what is bad about this movie. Rather than do that, I will list what is good: nothing. Absolutely nothing. And it isn't bad-movie-funny, or bad-movie-goofy, or bad-movie loveable, or bad-movie entertaining at any point or for any reason. MOON BEAST is best seen in full eclipse with the sound turned off.
