8622064,4,B00GBT63IC,"Aki Kaurismakis 1992 film LA VIE DE BOHME is the Finnish auteur's loose adaptation of Henri Murger's classic 19th-century collection of short stories, set in contemporary Paris with an eclectic cast of French and Finnish actors, all speaking French. As the film opens, the penniless aspiring writer Marcel (Andr Wilms) is being evicted from his apartment. Though a series of amusing events, he falls in with the equally aspiring and penniless painter Rodolfo (Matti Pellonp) and composer Schaunard (Kari Vnnen). The film then tracks their comical struggles to make money, gain lasting fame, or charm women in spite of their lack of a stable existence (Evelyne Didi plays a major supporting role as Rodolfo's girlfriend Mimi). Though the three men are perennially underdogs, their firm friendship and readiness to share what little they have makes the film a heartwarming experience.

The poorly spoken French of the foreign actors, as well as the mismatch between the ostensibly 1992 setting and the decaying interiors, must have seemed bizarre for viewers who didn't know Kaurismki before. However, it is quite of a piece with this director's prior work. Kaurismki had made a number of films in his native Helsinki that are ostensibly set in the present day, but feature ramshackle tenements, working-class struggles, and antique appliances that are all right out of the 1950s. At some point, a band will appear on a stage playing high-energy rock music from a bygone age. In LA VIE DE BOHEME, Kaurismki has reused the exact same elements in a Parisian context. He managed to find decrepit places one would have never expected in the modern city, and in one scene a punk band perform even if it has little relevance to the overall plot. While Rodolfo and Schaunard are explained as Albanian and Irish immigrants, respectively, they are really bringing to this film a typically Finnish quality.

One of the quirks of Kaurismki's Finnish-language output is that the actors deliver their deadpan, almost robotic lines in the Finnish literary language, which is vastly different from the ordinary Finnish spoken language. Kaurismki has managed to create a similar effect here by lifting dialogue from Murger's original book, as in 19th-century stories the actors often speak with elaborate constructions and literary flair that is completely unrealistic for the particular setting. Their's also an amusing opposition between the garrulous Marcel and -- remember, the character's Irish or Albanian back stories need not be taken seriously -- the silent, stony other characters, as the Finns are an infamously taciturn race.

Still, Kaurismki's applications of his perennial formula are usually very entertaining, and I never tire of his dark humourly vision. And even if most of the other elements are the same as always, LA VIE DE BOHEME features an unexpected ending. Usually in Kaurismki you can foresee the nice little ending that's going to come from a mile away, but here he takes the viewer by surprise.

Cinema aficionados will enjoy the small roles of a sugar baron, played by legendary French New Wave actor Jean-Paul Laud, and a publishing magnate, played by American director Samuel Fuller. (Viewers who don't know who Fuller is will think it odd that he exits the stage with some profanity spoken in English and a distinctive old-timey New York Jewish accent!)

Still, for me LA VIE DE BOHME was a funny and touching picture.",1479513600,,3717,5.357876712328767
8622065,4,B00GBT63IC,"Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's black and white adaptation of Scene de la Vie de Boheme (originally a non fiction book by Henri de Murger dealing with the lives of the starving bohemian artists of the Paris of the first decades of the 19th century, and later a famous opera by Puccini) is surprisingly faithful to its source material, despite its modern settings. The place is still Paris, and the film closely follows both the book and the opera, with the proud but poor artists living at the day to day to survive in the city of lights. We even have the famous burning of the manuscripts to get some heat during the cold winter. The late Matti Pellonpaa, a Kaurismaki regular, stars as Rodolfo, as well as other less known, but equally fine actors (the actress playing Mimi, however, fails to create an impression). There are a couple of cameos by Nouvelle Vague faves Jean-Pierre Leaud and Samuel Fuller.",1397692800,4,909,4.723270440251572
8622066,4,B00GBT63IC,"Aki Kaurismki is surely one of Finland's all-time greats. No Finn will use three words if two will suffice and Kaurismki does it all dead-pan. His films represent the peak of black humour and his mate Matti Pellonp who plays a key role in most of his films is the perfect foil for Kaurismki's genius. Here, even though just about everyone knows the story, Kaurismki manages to bring out hilarious black humour in the face of tragedy. He even has a part for his dog who like Pellonp is a regular in his films. The Criterion transfer is clear and better than my Finnish DVDs but as is all too often the case with Criterion transfers, the subtitles are quite ordinary. They are often hard to read against the black and white film stock and despite being asked many times to improve their subtitles Criterion do not seem interested. Their Seven Samurai Blu-ray transfer was another with under-par subtitles and it beats me why they cannot get it right. Another subtitle grumble is Criterion's reluctance to subtitle English. Here Andr Wilms talks in English with a heavy French accent and no subtitles appear. This is just lazy. I do not like the Criterion boxes as they are too thick and waste valuable shelf space. Because they use non-standard inserts and booklets it is very hard to repack them if the case breaks or just to save space. Criterion seem determined to be different for the sake of it even when they could so obviously do better. I find that irritating but put up with it to get the better film transfer. With just a little more consideration they could please everyone but sadly choose not to.",1392508800,13,1607,4.6223776223776225
