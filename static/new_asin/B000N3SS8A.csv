8174485,4,B000N3SS8A,"I don't know what to compare this to. I do like the video and its inspirational to get projects done. I got the 2 video set, same video project but one had scenes from car shows, clubs, music in the back ground in between. Some places Ian was a little weird ,maybe uncomfortable (high on fumes? glue?)or getting shock value.  The other recording is the same and is much more straightforward they were both done at the same time.
My 4year old step son really likes it too.",1280966400,,471,4.3522727272727275
8174486,5,B000N3SS8A,"Having been in the business since birth(dad opened shop in '38), I like Ian's no nonsense style of build...granted, he has a couple of design ideas that i don't agree with, but hey, it gets down the road, and looks good doing it.",1264204800,,229,4.348837209302325
8174487,5,B000N3SS8A,"Better than the TV's rebuilds in that this guy builds all his own parts. It's not a thinly disguised commercial for some vendors wares. I learned a lot and I have built a couple of roadsters and presently working on one now.
 An old dog such as my self can learn new tricks.

  The pin-up girl part could be better but she's is quite.
