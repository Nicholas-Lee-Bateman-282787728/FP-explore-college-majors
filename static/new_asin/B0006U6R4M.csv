The writing is superb, its not too goofy or stupid, and it doesnt have the gloss of the usual TV fare but there is nothing ameteurish about it. Probably the most original show Ive ever seen. I could gush about it forever, just buy it.",1115337600,3,305,4.275862068965517
8590215,4,B0006U6R4M,"What can you say?  YOu've seen these or you haven't.  If you haven't, it's an aquired taste.  I have my favorite episodes.  I think this show is hilarious.  Bubbles and Jay-Rock are the best.  The DVD's don't offer much of special features.  Some bloopers and a quick interview with Bubbles.  Get it to have the collection of episodes.  I think it is overpriced at this site.",1108425600,4,375,4.5606060606060606
