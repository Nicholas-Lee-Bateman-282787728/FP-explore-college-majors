8481229,5,B005OE9XEQ,"A star I like to see made me want to buy this movie that I bought at amazon.com. She is actress Lin Chen-Chi whose name is rather similar to mine in Romanization. She retired from movies and manages a restaurant chain in China now. I think she is age 57 now. I have been told that she resembled me when she was my age. In this movie, an older man has three pretty daughters who are practically slaves to him in the bar he owns. There is all too much truth in that in the past. Chen Ping always looks the part of a bar girl who will sell herself to men cheaply. She is also in ""The Call Girls"" and other such movies. Lin Chen-Chi looks innocent and unspoiled and refuses to go as far in pleasing men as her sisters do. She wins the love of a fine young man from a wealthy family. There are problems in their relationship.",1358208000,,820,4.067901234567901
