Needless to say I watched every second of this engaging film including the 45 minutes of bonus features all in one sitting.  I am a female that was raised in and have always lived in three of the largest metropolitan cities in the United States.  Image my surprise to be pulled into this world of rugged, down-to-earth, fearless men and beasts.  A world that up until now I knew close to nothing about.  It was real, suspenseful, entertaining, and even inspiring.  These men's focus, drive and determination can be applied to anyone's ambition and dream for their life.  I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend this film.",1246147200,11,763,4.734848484848484
