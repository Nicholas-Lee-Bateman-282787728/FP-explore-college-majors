5315363,3,B009CHY7UG,"Aaron K. Carters post-zompocalypse film is probably one of the oddest experiences I have had watching indie/homegrown movies. The story focuses on a Father/daughter drama of survival post outbreak, like way post. Very little society is left and most of the rottens have rotted away. All that is left is bands of people fighting one another to carve out dominance over the Kansas terrain. Throw in that only daughter seems to be immune from the virus that is blamed by the whole of female society for its destruction, and you have an old school male dominated saga unfolding.

Overall Dead Kansas is gonna disappoint a lot of people who set out to watch the film. It is on the lower quality side of indie film making-not sure if they had a budget or not. Didnt look like they did. The story is been-there-done-that, and the acting really should have been reigned in more on several of these characters. All that said, the oddity of nature that accompanies these characters, the off-tempo line deliveries, and the sound track somehow put off a Fred Olen Ray/Gil Bettman vibe. By the last scene I actually found myself into the surviving characters and excited that they left the story open for a sequel.",1430870400,,1201,4.746411483253588
5315364,1,B009CHY7UG,"One of the worst movies yet!  The actress playing the daughter had black hair and was homely; however, about half way thru, another actress played the role.  Everything about this movie is bad, writing, script, acting, etc. One star is way too generous for this sorry trash.",1430265600,2,274,4.808510638297872
5315365,2,B009CHY7UG,"Dead Kansas is a c-horror-comedy microbudget indie zombie video, so unless you're prepared for that kind of experience, you'll definitely be disappointed (or even pissed, as a couple reviewers apparently were). If you're up for not taking a video too seriously, and you enjoy indie weekend-shoot type videos with a sense of humor, don't spend your $2 on this, or your time, or you'll probably, as I noted, end up ticked off. But, if you're a 4:20'er, or an indie microbudget horror fan, and you're not looking for Citizen Kane or The Shining, you may find yourself having a bit of fun.

With that in mind, I've seen this a couple times. DK does have a few actors who have played minor roles in notable films (as one reviewer pointed out). In that regard, it does have a bit of a leg up on its fellow c-movies.

No, there are no scares, no chills, nothing spooky - it's not that kind of video. It's a movie you can laugh at, and laugh with. The hammy over-serious acting of Glen (the most consistently funniest part of the whole movie, imo). And, overall, it's not the worst video I've never seen. Close, but no, not the worst.

Long story short - microbudget c-horror comedy fans may find it a fun viewing. If you're looking for genuine scares or chills, or anything like a b-movie or Hollywood-esque quality, probably best to wait till this comes out on Netflix or Amazon Prime.

Cool music, by the way.",1429747200,3,1404,4.537549407114624
5315366,1,B009CHY7UG,"Save your money. I expected it to be a b movie, but you see 1 zombie in the entire movie. This movie was beyond lame. Watch dead and breakfast or Fido instead.",1427414400,3,159,4.0
5315367,1,B009CHY7UG,I am pretty sure that this is the worst movie I have ever endured. There is absolutely nothing worth watching. Don't waste your time.,1426636800,3,133,4.583333333333333
5315368,5,B009CHY7UG,"I kind of went into this expecting a typical zombie movie...bloody and scary.  Lets say its everything but that.  To my surprise, there actually wasn't any ""horror"" in it at all.  It was more of an adventure/western film, with zombies going on in the backdrop.  You have to use your imagination in some parts.  However, I really enjoyed the story.  The sets were cool, and the acting was better than most films with this budget.  I really was happy to see Joe McQueen (aka: black Hulk) from Confesstions Of A SuperHero in this.  Someone finally gave that guy a chance.  Overall, if you go in with an open mind and a twelve pack, you will enjoy Dead Kansas.",1384992000,7,656,4.491525423728813
5315369,5,B009CHY7UG,"The film is about some hick bad-guys who want to kidnap a farmer's daughter...during a zombie apocalypse.  There are circus freaks too.  Look out for cameos by horror veteran Irwin Keyes (House Of 1000 Corpses) and Ben Woolf (American Horror Story).

This is a moderately entertaining film.  Its obvious the filmmakers had a low budget and some production problems.  Heck, even the main actress is replaced by another actress mid-way through... but somehow they made it work.  If you like fun, off-beat cult movies, this one is for you.

Please note: There are two DVD versions of DEAD KANSAS.  The first, only contains Act 1 - which is 17 minutes.  This DVD has the father and daughter in a cellar on the front cover.  The second DVD (the complete version) has all five acts edited together - which is 64 minutes.  This DVD has the girl in cage cover.",1383004800,10,852,4.651006711409396

8539581,5,B009CHY7UG,"Aaron K. Carter uses Horror & Humor to tell this Frightfully Wonderful Tale of Human Survival, in the midst of a Zombie Apocalypse ! He doesn't let the flow of the film slow down with minor details; & presents his Story in an engaging manner, filled with Blood, Gore, & mayhem. The Players are well-cast & include a vast array of Talent, with the Biggest Name belonging to IRWIN KEYES, who's appeared in ""House of 1000Corpses"" & ""Black Dynamite"", as well as numerous other movies & TV Shows, portraying ""Giant"" from the Town of Circus-FolK, with BEN WOOLF playing the diminutive Town Leader ""Squeak"" .
  The Story revolves around a Father & Daughter trying to survive & Protect each other, while there's destruction all around them, & the Search for ""Doctor Emerson"", played by DARRYL DICK, to heal the Father . The Father, ""Glenn"" is Portrayed by AARON GUERRERO & the Daughter ""Emma"" is handled by a Trio of Talented Ladies, ERIN MIRACLE, ALEXANDRIA LIGHTFORD, & the Young MADISON MENDEZ: & they are All Equally Brilliant in their Roles .
  MICHAEL CAMP appears to have a Great Time playing the Bandit Leader & All-Around Bad Guy ""Jebediah"", & he does a Bang-Up job of it ! Rounding out the Cast is JULIETTE DANIELLE as ""Rebecca"", BRITTANY PASTOR as the ""Dart Thrower"", & LAURA E. WHITE as a ""Bar Patron"" .
A Special Thank YOU to Beautiful DENISE JOHNS RAYL for bringing Her Obvious Talents to the role of ""Busty Bar Patron"" !
  Thank You, AARON K CARTER & fellow writer NICHOLAS A. DeNICOLA for this Fun, Interesting, & Horror-Filled Film !!!! Well Done;

8539582,1,B009CHY7UG,"Worse than lame. I love this genre, especially microbudget of this genre. But this movie was just plain stinking. Idiotic dialogue, incompetent directing, terrible editing. A marvel that a sack of dreck this bad ever made to a finished product. Not worth watching.",1467676800,,264,5.162790697674419
8539583,4,B009CHY7UG,I'm a sucker for a grindhouse movie. And I really liked this one. I see people giving movies like this bad reviews. But you have to watch a movie like this for what it is. And it's not that bad.,1454371200,2,194,3.875
8539584,2,B009CHY7UG,It's a campy low budget film that wasn't worth money it was too cheesy for me to get through.,1434412800,,93,3.9473684210526314
8539585,5,B009CHY7UG,"Grab some friends and a case of beer and forget the negative reviews. Dead Kansas is a unique take on the tired zombie genre. With a fun cast that includes the legendary Irwin Keyes and Ben Wool (Meep, American Horror Story) Dead Kansas is a B movie riot. It's only 2 dollars to rent it, I'd say that's a bargain.",1434326400,,313,4.233333333333333
