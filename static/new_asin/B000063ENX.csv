7959145,5,B000063ENX,"this video is for the advanced salsa dancers.  the steps here are fantastic and are fully explained in detail but may require a lot of practice.
this video is better than her other video ""salsa advance"" which is more acrobatic and can be dangerous to execute and is not fully taught in detail compared
with this one.",1355184000,,316,4.543859649122807
7959146,5,B000063ENX,This DVD is very good for People who has dance experience or for teachers who wanted very new combinations and many super show-effekts. I'm a dancing-master and for me it wasn't too heavy to learn this stuff. It's definitly not for Beginners! You must do a good warm-up before learning these combinations.,1142380800,,305,4.884615384615385
7959147,2,B000063ENX,"I bought this DVD after reading the first 2 reviews.

Moves might be good, but quality and presentation of the DVD is very basic. Menu is poor, background music is the same.

Furthermore, I was hoping to see the all the combinations put into practice instead of seeing the bloopers. Bloopers can be another ""extra"" feature on the DVD.

In its place, I'd recommend Super Mario's salsa DVD which to me is far better presented both content and quality wise (if you are not too concerned about Super Mario's looks)",1129593600,2,510,4.644444444444445
7959148,5,B000063ENX,"Dancing salsa for more than 3 years and was looking for a video to explain some of the fast, new combinations in the night club these days- this was exactly what I was looking for.
It showed the moves, counted them, then explained both man and lady's parts so my partner and I knew exactly where we were going wrong.
We used many moves in our new routine for the contest at our night club and WE WON!
I love Josie's videos.",1047254400,4,423,4.170731707317073
7959149,4,B000063ENX,"My first reaction after watching the video was positive. I thought that Josie and her partner demonstrated useful and advanced salsa variations that can be learned in time and with practice. Before considering learning some of the variations, I watched the video a second time and I was still pleased with the moves, the presentation, breakdown and execution of the salsa variations. Many of them are common, meaning I had already learned them, currently dance them and regularly see the variations executed by salsa dancers here in Toronto. If you are not looking for a flashy background in the video, background salsa music and high energy you will be please with it. It's simple, the steps are well executed and broken down and the variations are advanced moves because you have to have excellent rhythm, timing and body control to dance them properly once learned. This a great video for those looking to continue learning more salsa moves and for those who need a refresher from time to time.",1044403200,2,997,4.905325443786983
7959150,5,B000063ENX,"I have been following Josie for years, taking her workshops and have all of her videos.  I also have other advanced videos on the market.  Nobody breaks it down like Josie Neglia!
Not only are all the counts described, but this video also has leading tips, following tips, tips for turning and how to execute the moves with better balance and grace.
I have been to salsa congresses in different cities for the past two years and Josie has all the latest trends of salsa moves here- such as hand tosses, multiple turns for men and ladies, surprise endings to cross-body leads...etc.
I love the partnering moves.  I use them with my dance partner and we always get a crowd around us at the club.
I highly recommend this video if you want to stand out at the night club!
The other videos I have just don't break thisng down as clearly as Josie's videos do.  She's the greatest!",1032048000,4,874,4.477987421383648
7959151,3,B000063ENX,"Great improvement instruction wise on her last couple of videos. Very clear & detailed instruction.
This video is for intermediate to advanced level.
However the video is just nice variations on common moves.
There is nothing new or really exciting in this video.
It is a nice video just not great.",1025136000,6,298,4.862745098039215
7959152,2,B000063ENX,"Josie is a great Salsa dancer and I love her style and agility, so it hurts me to score her video low.
I think she could have done a lot better. My criticisms are:
1. Salsa is sensual and fun, but they seemed stiff and somewhat mechanical.
2. some of the combinations presented seemed forced. They didn't seem to have a natural flow.
3. I also didn't find the combinations interesting.
4. Taking out the section where all the moves taught are performed while dancing to almost a full song b/4 and/or prior to the moves being taught was a bad choice, in my opinion.
I think her other advanced video was a much much better work.",1023408000,4,626,4.358974358974359
7959153,5,B000063ENX,"I have all of Josie's videos!!. I purchased her two new videos as soon as they became available. I absolutely LOVE both videos 8 & 9. I am a trained dancer and have purchased many videos and taken dozens of latin dance classes from dozens of latin dance instructors. I have always wanted to take lessons from Josie, but I have never been able to. I believe these videos are better because I can go as slow or as fast I like, I can put her on pause when I need to take a break without having to pay extra!!
These new videos are amazing,they both have very clear and concise instruction and are very nicely organized which makes them easy to follow (even for my mom). Before Josie's videos I felt that instructional dance videos were useless, but you have to try them and see for yourself how valueable and useful they actually are. These videos will help you become a beautifully trained latin dancer. If you just learn a few of the combinations you will blow people away on the dance floor. All the the steps and combo's in her new videos are what's hot right now, she is so on top of what's going on in the Salsa World, in fact I think she's a trend setter in the Salsa World. Everybody wants to either dance like her or dance with her. Becuase of these new videos I feel that I truly dance like her. Not only is she gorgeous, but it is obvious how professional she is. They are also fun videos to watch with your friends. I highly recomend both videos to anyone who wants to learn how to dance Salsa from a REAL professional Dancer. They are worth every penny.",1020297600,2,1562,4.280405405405405
