8205773,5,B000SL1UKA,"I purchased this version of Dune two years ago and must have watched it several times.  It is a more believable version and runs well with the book.  The actors are also very good and nowhere as ""stiff"" as the original Dune Movie which is too European and formal.  I also have the movie but would like to see the longer version on DVD.  This is a must have for Dune addicts.
