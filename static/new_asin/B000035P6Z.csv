Don't get me wrong, I love the movie (& Pam!!), but this DVD should be destroyed ASAP!! The mono sound is no better than an average VHS tape, but the picture quality is fairly decent. I thought that I would see 'Coffy' with surround sound, but NOOOOOO!!

1257002,5,B000035P6Z,i love the force of Pam Grier.she seeks revenge and gets it.she does whatever she has to find the Pushers&dealers.i can't stand the term Blackexplotation? do folks say that about all the gangster films and say  Italianexplotation? i mean it's loaded.

1257003,4,B000035P6Z,"After her younger sister dies (offscreen) of a drug overdose, surgical nurse and one-woman vigilante army Pam Grier sets out to punish those she believes responsible for her sister's addiction.  Masquerading as a  for-hire call girl, Coffy infiltrates the supposed hierarchy of the city's  dope and sex trade in what starts as vengeance for her sister but turns  into a crusade to rid the city of all its filth, murdering all along the  way, from a small-time pimp and drug dealer (who gets his head blown off  shortly after the opening credits) to her congressman lover, who turns out  to have a piece of the action as well and is as corrupt as the rest of the  bunch.  Despite the sober description, this is not an ""important""  film per se; actually, it's pretty trashy, but fascinating when trying to  examine who this movie is made for.  I guess we're supposed to root for  Coffy as she goes on her murder spree, but, as her ""good cop""  friend (who naturally is murdered before the end of the first reel)  explains to her, the drug problem is already widespread, and who is  ultimately to blame?  Factor in also that our heroine is also asked to  disrobe a number of times for the camera and act very promiscuously, and  that instead of the ""black heroes"" that this genre supposedly  provided to the minority audiences, we mostly get pimps, dealers, addicts,  chauffeurs :)... At the end, we see Coffy, having recently snuffed out her  boyfriend and dejectedly thrown her trusty shotgun on the floor in front of  him, walking down a beach alone, almost certain to be picked up by the cops  eventually (though the closing credits song proclaim Coffy as ""a  shining symbol of black pride"")...Very cynical filmmaking and  confusing stuff--the general message seems to be ""everything and  everyone around you is polluted--you can try to fight the system, but  ultimately, you'll lose.""  How's that for uplifting the race?  Strangely enough, I like this movie for all of its negatives and excesses,  and it is an emblem of a time when ""blaxploitation"" producers and  filmmakers were trying to tap into something different, however misguided;  reflects a lot of backlash from the supposedly idealistic 60s.  Incredible  amounts of violence and gobs of gratuitous nudity in this one.  A HEAVILY  edited version of this was recently shown on TV with Ruby Dee and Ossie  Davis, who awkwardly tried to promote this stuff as quality Black Heritage  cinema.  Add some sleaze to your life and rent this one.",947721600,34,2498,4.827014218009479

King George appears on the scene looking like Dolemite. Whack-a-da music abounds as does Pam Grier. Like one of the character's says, ""I just want to get high and watch."" A favorite film of drive-in movies. Includes a young Sid Haig and break away clothing cat fight.

1257072,3,B000035P6Z,"Having paid her dues in several co-starring roles in a number of exploitation films, actress Pam Grier was given top billing in her first film, a lead title in the then hot genre known as Blaxploitation. Blaxploitation films featured predominantly black casts in more often than not stereotypical roles (i.e. pimp, prostitute, detective, etc.) but eventually evolved into more mainstream style action heroes. This is a good example of that.

Coffy is a nurse who has witnessed firsthand the damage done by drug dealers in her city. Not only does she deal with them at her chosen profession, her younger sister was hooked on drugs by these dealers on the streets. Now she takes to those same streets at night in order to wreak vengeance upon them. It escalates to more blood spilling when the same dealers kill a police friend of Coffys.

Infiltrating the gang led by top man King George (in full pimp style regalia with cape and all) Coffy sets the organization up against their suppliers. At the same time when the chance presents itself she opens up with whatever weapon she has at hand to kill a few on her own. Before the movie ends the streets will run red and vengeance will be extracted, but will Coffy survive?

The movie was written and directed by Jack Hill, famous for movies like SPIDER BABY and giving Grier her earlier break into film in movies like THE BIG BIRD CAGE and THE BIG DOLL HOUSE. Reunited here they work together to create a credible heroine whose means might be a bit off kilter but whose reason for doing what she does is noble. It almost harkens back to the Wild West movies where the rancher loses all only to go after those who burned down his house.

There is plenty of action on screen to see from start to finish. Grier does a solid job of acting here but its interesting to watch her from here into subsequent films to witness her abilities increase with each one. She should have had more opportunities than she did and not be relegated to mostly this genre, but such is Hollywood, a land that screams about equality and then did little about it.

The quality of this release from Olive is well made offering the best picture quality available with limited extras. The fact that they chose to release this alongside 3 other gems from the genre speaks well of them for doing so. Fans of Grier and the genre will want to add all 3 of her films in the mix.",1438300800,,2389,4.520833333333333

But when she found out that LuBelle was hooked on heroin at the age of 11, Coffy was overcome with a desire for vengeance. She learns from her old friend Carter Brown (William Elliot), now a police officer, that a Las Vegas mobster named Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus) is controlling the local drug dealers and pimps, and she sets her sights on him. A vicious attack on Carter for resisting corruption in the police force only strengthens Coffy's resolve.

1974's ""Foxy Brown"", which was to be a sequel to ""Coffy"", might be more famous today, but ""Coffy"" is a better film. The emotions seem more real, the plot more believable, and Coffy is an average woman. Pam Grier's funky, flamboyant wardrobe in ""Foxy Brown"" was memorable, but it didn't do her character any favors. ""Coffy"" wouldn't be successful without Grier's charisma, but Jack Hill's focus on character and social issues are a large part of why this film retains its high status in the ranks of exploitation cinema.

Coffy is an ""everywoman"" character who rises to the occasion under extraordinary circumstances. She's the type of character that was a staple of Harrison Ford's career, but with more nudity and a badder attitude. In addition to her wits and sheer brazenness, Coffy uses her sexuality like a wrecking ball in the pursuit of her prey. She makes vigilante justice look attractive in more ways than one. There is not a lot of grey area in these films. Pimps and dealers in hard drugs are scum. It's a forgone conclusion that they all end up dead, often by gruesome, visually arresting means. Perhaps that's ironic, considering that sex and drugs were not as demonized in the 1970s as they are now. Coffy is like a cross between Jack Ryan and Dirty Harry, making Pam Grier the first female action star.

The DVD (MGM 2001): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by Jack Hill. He discusses how he got involved in the project, how he managed to get some content into the film beyond what the studio wanted, inspiration for the name ""Coffy"", characters, cast, racism in the film industry, and scene-by-scene commentary about locations and his recollections of filming. It's a constant, worthwhile commentary. The film was shot in just 18 days. Subtitles are available for the film in French and Spanish. Dubbing is also available in French and Spanish.",1348099200,,2659,4.878318584070796

Sad when you realize that she was virtually invisible in American cinema for almost twenty years. What a powerful presence--probably the first female action star.

1257207,5,B000035P6Z,"Coffy was the original Jackie Brown.  I came to this movie by way of Quentin Tarantino's top 12 films list.  I can see how a great deal of his cinematic vision and style derived from this film. And I agree with him regarding its thorough enjoyability.

  Coffy is an early 70s movie, usually grouped with the ""Blacksploitation"" genre.  Coffy, played by Pam Grier, is a woman vigilante out to avenge herself against drug pushers who have left her little sister in a coma.  She finds herself out of her depth in a web of intrigue, but by dint of her sharp wits and a little luck, she comes out on top.  The movie is neatly plotted with several memorable twists.  The acting is a bit questionable in parts, but overall is passable.  The story conveys many salutory social messages and lessons for its target audience, and for other peoples as well.

  Pam Grier did a reprise in Quentin Tarantino's movie Jackie Brown, where she plays a very similar character.  Sadly Tarantino went off the rails after this movie, probably wanting to branch into other genres, creating the horribly unaesthetic ""Kill Bill"" series and finally losing stature as an artist with ""Inglorious Basterds"", a general insult against humanity, in an effort to endear himself to the Hollywood moguls.

1257212,3,B000035P6Z,"Pam Grier stars as Coffy. She's a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick, you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts.

There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films, and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters.

Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its type, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and sex-crazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum.

Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent, being both tough-as-nails, and drop-dead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these sorts of films are unwatchable, without her as the main character.

If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other films, like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze, than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy, degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films, don't stoop as low to get revenge, as Coffy did.

I'd say, only watch Coffy, if you're unable to see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress, makes viewing Coffy bearable.",1261872000,2,1634,5.037037037037037

Coffy comes together as a quality film because the character is so likeable, and a standard B-movie formulaic plot is transformed into a really good movie.

As always, the plot is simple. Pam Grier plays a nurse whose
young sister suffers a near fatal overdose thanks to a
local pusher. Coffy's reaction (in grand Blaxploitation style)
is to eliminate the pusher and everyone in proximity to him.
She resorts to various means to infiltrate the
system, locate the main culprits, and dispose of them with
a firey vengeance. We're taken on an entertaining blood ride
of costumes, clever weaponry, cat fights, and colorful accents

accent, which dies away before the end of the scene and is never
heard from again. LOL. I'm pretty sure the director was thinking that Pam Grier in a bikini

1257267,4,B000035P6Z,"A minor digression before I review ""Coffy"".  I remember some 20 years ago Siskel and Ebert doing a special show on the state of black cinema.  They cited Pam Grier as an example of talented black actors who were underutilized.  Grier was a superstar in the niche career that she carved out in ""blaxploitation"" films.  When she went mainstream in ""Fort Apache-The Bronx"" the best role they could give her was that of a strung-out murderous prostitute.  It took some 15 years for a maverick director like Quentin Tarantino to recognize the qualities that Grier brought to the big screen with ""Jackie Brown"".  As for ""Coffy"" itself, if you're looking for this film as a serious examination of the drug problem that had, and still does, a stranglehold on the inner city then look elsewhere.  Outside of a perfunctory scene of Coffy(Grier) visiting her baby sister in re-hab there is little else in the film that would give you food for thought.  ""Coffy"" is high camp.  Outside of Coffy's cop friend most of the other characters are played over-the-top.  The film also consists of a series of outrageous violent confrontations most memorable Coffy blowing the head off of a drug dealer with a double barrelled shotgun.  The film also takes every possible opportunity to show off Grier's impressive attributes.  Grier has a definite screen presence but she's not the polished actress here that she would later become.  There's a certain stiltedness in some of her line deliveries.  Bottom line, entertaining show.

1257269,4,B000035P6Z,"I continue to marvel at the DVD revolution. When I first learned about DVD several years ago, I rightly figured that it would change the way we watch movies. What I didn't figure was how much. Thanks to the acquisition of a relatively cheap player and a cheaper subscription to a rental service, I can sit in front of the television set EVERY NIGHT and watch cult, exploitation, horror, action, and other films in dozens of genres that were next to impossible to find a few years ago. And if you could find a beat up VHS copy of a low budget classic, for example, you would pay top dollar for the privilege because you had to buy, not rent, the film. Video stores out where I live long ago quit carrying the sorts of films I longed to see. Heck, the last time I considered myself lucky at the local movie store was when I found an uncut version of Joe D'Amato's ""Buio Omega,"" under the name ""Buried Alive,"" at a major retailer well known for not carrying such cinematic treasures. And that was probably fifteen years ago! Yep, DVD is not only here to stay but also keeps growing by leaps and bounds. No film is too outrageous for rerelease on DVD, which is where Jack Hill's 1973 blaxploitation epic ""Coffy"" enters the picture.

Director Hill sets the tone of his project immediately by introducing us to Coffy (Pam Grier), a nurse by day and an avenging angel by night. Sadly, a bunch of drug dealers corrupted her little sister some time ago, turning the poor lass into a mentally unstable basket case who now resides full time in a bed at the local psych ward. Coffy knows she can't go to the police for help because of the systemic racism of the man, so she decides to take matters into her own hands. Decked out in the steamiest outfit she can find, she lures a drug kingpin and his lieutenant back to his apartment in order to dispatch the two with shotgun and syringe. Two down for her sister with a bunch more to go. In the meantime, Coffy rekindles her friendship with a black cop named Carter (William Elliot) while maintaining a relationship with fast talking politico Howard Brunswick (Booker Bradshaw). Our heroine comes close to telling her cop friend all about her missions of carnage, but before she can do so a bunch of heavies beat Carter senseless for refusing to go on the take. It's not surprising at all that these same thugs are the guys Coffy will eventually go after as her plot takes her up the underworld chain of command. But in order to achieve her mission, she's going to need all of her feminine wiles. Seeking revenge is serious business--just ask Charles Bronson.

Coffy learns about the existence of drug kingpin Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus of M*A*S*H* fame) who associates with a powerful procurer named King George (Robert DoQui). In order to ingratiate herself to Vitroni, Coffy goes undercover as a Jamaican harridan named Mystique complete with hilarious accent and a huge Afro. When you stop laughing, feel free to continue. Grier's character puts the moves on King George, convincing him to take her on as his star employee. The other ladies in his majesty's service resent the power Mystique holds over the boss, so Coffy needs to worry about the girls plotting her downfall even as she strives to keep her true identity under wraps. Mystique manages to grab Vitroni's attention at a soiree where a full scale catfight breaks out between Coffy and the other gals, a catfight involving thrown food, slapping, a broken bottle, and razor blades carefully placed in Mystique's Afro just in case one of these sneaky girls tries to pull her hair. The movie flies by rapidly from this point forward, with Coffy discovering just how far Vitroni and his goons--including the ominous Russian thug Omar (Sid Haig)--are willing to go. Expect a few plot twists before the credits roll.

I really got a charge out of ""Coffy."" I've always been a big fan of Pam Grier, one of those rare actresses who just keep getting better looking with age. She's great as the relentless Coffy, a woman out to destroying her enemies anyway she can. And while her acting isn't the greatest, the script easily takes much of the blame off the performers. Hill's movie is pure exploitation, more focused on exaggerated visual theatrics like Omar tying King George to the bumper of his car and dragging him through the streets than engaging in intellectually stimulating dialogue. The movie does examine several themes--racism, crime in the black community, and drug abuse among others--but the real driving force of the film is mixing up sex and violence in ways aimed at shocking audiences and pushing boundaries. I initially found the scene between Vitroni and Coffy deeply offensive until I placed it in the context of the film as a whole. Black audiences could bellow in rage at the overt racism expressed by a few of the characters and then sit back and relax as Coffy dealt out her own brand of justice to the evildoers on behalf of the black community.

The primary extra on the DVD is a commentary with Jack Hill that is, unfortunately, rather boring to listen to. It's the film that should draw in audiences, and in that respect ""Coffy"" will succeed because of it's in your face attitude and over the top histrionics. I can't wait to follow this one up with the other blaxploitation classics. Although this is my first excursion into this genre, I suspect ""Coffy"" is an excellent place for the novice to start.

1257273,4,B000035P6Z,"While Coffy (1973) may not have been Pam Grier's first foray into feature films it was the one that really launched her (and her twins) into the public eye, garnering an impressive amount of commercial success.  Written and directed by Jack Hill (Spider Baby, Switchblade Sisters), who would team up with Grier a year later to release Foxy Brown (1974), the film features, along with Grier, Booker Bradshaw (Skullduggery), Robert DoQui (RoboCop, Miracle Mile), William Elliott (Night of the Lepus), Sid Haig (House of 1000 Corpses), Lee de Broux (True Grit), and Allan Arbus (Putney Swope), probably best known for his reoccurring role on the television series ""M*A*S*H"" as army psychiatrist Major Sidney Freedman.

As the film begins we find ourselves in a swingin' soul club where we see a young African American man approach an older African American man sporting an Afro that looks much like a black, shag rug (turns out the younger man is a skeevy dope dealer and the older man his supplier).  Anyway, seems the dealer has a present for his supplier in the form of Pam Grier, who's posing as a strung out junkie that will do anything (or anyone) to `get straight' i.e. obtain a fix.  The trio heads back to the dealer's apartment (seems the supplier plans to snog Pam up good while the dealer only wants to shoot up and watch), and once there things seem to be going according to plan, that is until Pam produces a sawed off shotgun...as far as what happens next, well, let's just say neither man had a good night.  Turns out the woman's name is Coffy (Grier) and she's a hospital nurse whose younger sister took some bad dope and is now a permanent resident of a juvenile drug rehab ward.  In retaliation, Coffy offered up some street justice (as seen in the beginning of the film), but soon learns from her policeman friend Carter (Elliott), who seems the only cop on the force not on the take, that the drug business is a hydra i.e. a beast with many heads.  We, in turn, learn of a new player in town named Arturo Vitroni (Arbus), a heavy duty gangster from Las Vegas looking take over the vice and narcotic rackets.  After Carter suffers a serious beat down (he refused to take bribes) from Vitroni's goons (one of them played by Sid Haig), Coffy goes undercover as a Jamaican call girl named Mystique (complete with phony Jamaican accent), hoping to get close to Vitroni, who's a sadistic sleaze, by going through a local hustler named King George (DoQui), who makes the scene in a mustard colored jumpsuit/cape ensemble, topped off with Elton John glasses (he kinda looks like Superpimp).  Anyway, Coffy ends up getting next to Vitroni, but things fall apart as she's recognized by one of Vitroni's men.  Things go round and round from here as Vitroni tries to figure out who Coffy's working with, while Coffy suffers some abuse before eventually turning the tables on all those muthas who did her wrong...

While I did enjoy Coffy a lot, it's actually a bit tamer when compared to Foxy Brown (1974), the latter originally intended to be a sequel but then changed to a stand-alone film shortly prior to production (why?  I have no idea).  While Foxy Brown had a lot more violence and overall action (along with a more mean spirited attitude), Coffy appears to have more of an actual story and greater dimensionality to the characters, at least in terms of Grier's case (both involved Grier's character infiltrating a criminal organization the intent being to destroy it from within).  Here we see a few scenes where Coffy is trying rationalize within herself the vigilante justice she engages in, struggling a bit with her conscience, and commenting a number of times how it feels like she's in a dream.  As a result, the film starts off with a bang (figuratively and literally), but then slows down a little in the middle, picking up speed again during the last half of the production.  Thing is, not many come into a film like this expecting (or wanting) character development, but I did appreciate its inclusion.  That's not to say the characters succeeded in appearing fully fleshed out (they really weren't), but there seemed an effort on writer/director Hill's part to make the film a little more than it was, and I think he succeeded, certainly assisted by the presence of Grier.  As far as the performances, they were all pretty funky, but for the type of film this is, they work well enough for my expectations.  I did learn a few things from this film, including the following...

1. In the land of chocolate mammaries, Pam Grier is queen (crude as it may sound, it's true).

2. In the 1970s it wasn't a big deal, politically speaking, for local councilmen with aspirations of becoming congressmen to share ownership in a sleazy strip club.

3. If you're a policeman who's not on the take, don't threaten to expose those fellow officers that are as you'll most likely end up being beaten to a bloody pulp by masked thugs brandishing axe handles.

4. You know you've made in the world of sleazy pimps when you've got your very own theme song.

5. Nothing accentuates a mustard colored jumpsuit like a mustard colored cape.

6. Macrame bikinis were fashionable in the 1970s.

7. Never grab a prostitute by the hair as she may be hiding razor blades in her coif.

8. Giant Afros were not only fashionable in the 1970s but also a great place to hide stuff.

9. I heard of drive by shootings, but this is the first time I've ever seen a drive by lynching.

10. Never pause in the middle of a busy freeway at night to take aim at someone with a gun as you'll most likely end up getting squashed like a bug by on coming traffic.

11. The Man is ultimately responsible for all illicit activities.

All in all if you're a purveyor of sleazy, exploitation cinema from the 1970s, Coffy is among the cream of the crop.  It may not be high art, but it sure as hell entertains.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), is decent enough, but does exhibit some grain in a couple areas.  As far as the audio it comes across well enough, available in English, French, and Spanish Dolby Digital mono.  As far as extras there's a commentary track with writer/director Jack Hill, an original theatrical trailer, and subtitles in French and Spanish.

By the way, for those interested, Coffy, while not as balls out violent as Foxy Brown, did feature more overall nekkidness. Another thing, there's a couple of boxed DVD sets out there with Pam Grier's films (one's called `Fox in a Box' and the other is called `The Best of Soul Cinema DVD Collection', both released by MGM), so if you're interested in buying this film, you might want to check out the availability on those sets as it might save you some green rather than buying the films individually.",1051056000,6,6775,4.667788057190917

It felt like another movie that was being cranked out of the blaxploitation factory, one that was not made with any care or originality. This film puts to shame a lot of great Blaxploitation films of the era, such as ""Shaft"", ""Uptown Saturday Night"" (which features a young Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, and Harry Belafonte) and ""Cooley High"", just to name a few.

She's highly convincing as a nurse out to avenge her sister who was sucked into the depths of drug addiction by money-hungry drug lords. It's evident that her character, Coffy, wants to shake the memory of the execution-style death she vengefully inflicted on the drug lord responsible. She has haunting flashbacks of it and wants to make sense of it all.  That's what makes Coffy so lovable- she's not trying to be a bad ..., she just wants justice.

1257300,4,B000035P6Z,"All of Pam Grier movies in the 70s, ""Coffy"" is the most famous.  She deserves it; watch this movie, and you see what so-called blaxploitation films are all about.
The fast-paced ""Coffy"" starts with a dynamite opening, in which Pam's character Coffy lures her enemy into a nasty surprise, and she blows away poor fool's head with a shotgun literally.  Then, her mission of eradicating drug racket goes on until a very bitter ending.  There are actions, fighting, nudity, and battling girls at a party where Pam uses most unexpected weapon -- salad!  Frankly they look rather bland by today's standard, but good soundtrack by Roy Ayres is still wonderful.
Probably the most interesting thing about ""Coffy"" is its gorgeous 70s fashion: music, clothes, and hairstyle.  even if you find its story a little stale, you never get tired of watching dresses, glasses, hats, and everything -- they are so big!  And surprising thing is that the film to certain extent reflects the political condition of those days (see how a black congressman address a speech about drug issues among Afro-Americans).
""Coffy"" is one of the movies that set the style of the 70s.  Those who are interested in that period should watch it (and the original ""Shaft"") once.",1009065600,24,1239,4.899521531100478

Some scenes range from outrageous to truly tasteless, but despite a few print flaws, the picture has never looked so good on DVD.  We're also treated to a running director's commentary and the trailer.  ""Coffy"" is a great revenge fantasy that should belong in your collection, and the rather low price makes it even more appealing.",1008028800,9,504,4.758620689655173
1257302,4,B000035P6Z,"Though 'Coffy' wasn't exactly on American film critics' top 10 lists back in 1973, that didn't stop those who actually MATTER (average moviegoers) from flocking to the theater to see this surprisingly stylish action film which sky-rocketed Pam Grier's career and set the standard for which just about every subsequent blaxploitation film and every other female heroine would be compared.  She commandeers the screen like no other actress ever has, whether she's got a double-barrelled shotgun under her arm, or sitting nude by a fireplace sipping champagne with her lover, or even when she's dropping the cheesy one-liners (""So you wanna play with knives, huh?  Well, you picked the wrong player!"") that this genre is known for.
This is the kind of movie anyone could like if they would just give it a shot. As the title character, Grier plays a nurse who works the night shift at a local hospital, and, haunted by her inability to keep her 11-year-old sister away from the lure of hard drugs, she has taken it upon herself to imprint her own brand of street justice on the lowlife criminals and dealers she comes across.  But after killing the local pusher in the opening sequence, her thirst for revenge still isn't quenched, and when a police officer friend of her's is severely battered by some corrupt cops for not taking bribes, it sets her off on a one-woman mission to follow the trail of corruption to the very top of the mob hierarchy.  And then put everyone involved on ice.  It may be a sub-par set-up, but the incredible Pam Grier is so multi-faceted in the role, she makes it all so legendary.  At once a sensitive, caring, nurturing friend to her people, and then an irresistable seductress who gets you right where she wants you before lining up a double-barrelled sawed-off shotgun right between your eyes with the cold intent of a vicious killer.  The highlight for me comes early, in that classic opening scene, when she holds one of the local pushers at gun-point and demands that he shoot a large amount of smack into his veins (""I can't take that, it'll kill me"", ""Well, if it do, you're gonna fly through them pearly gates with the biggest f---in' smile St. Peter ever seen!"").
While 'Coffy' isn't my favorite movie, it's one of the few movies that I'll probably never get tired of. It's the perfect film to just kick back some night and watch when you have nothing particularly important to do. Though I am a fan of 'Foxy Brown', which is considered by most to be the ultimate Pam Grier film, I've never enjoyed it as highly as I enjoyed this one. Don't analyze it or pick it apart. Just pop some popcorn, sit back, relax, bob your head to the '70s funk grooves, laugh at the sometimes-cheesy dialogue and melodramatic acting, and enjoy the show.",1003276800,8,2770,4.68724279835391
