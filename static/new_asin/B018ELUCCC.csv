7545535,5,B018ELUCCC,Saw this movie at the Gasparilla Int. Film Festival!  It was great!  I especially liked that it kept you guessing through the film and you didn't know who the killer was till the very end! :),1457827200,3,191,4.277777777777778

8742183,2,B018ELUCCC,"If you have Prime and don't have anything else to do, then you can watch this movie. Very convoluted plot with very poor acting, lines being read as though from a teleprompter, flat monotones, etc.",1472774400,,197,4.6571428571428575
8742184,1,B018ELUCCC,"This movie was terrible and a complete waste of time, I too watched it because of the rating which was a lie. Wish I would have read the written reviews first. I for sure will from now on!!!",1470960000,,190,4.026315789473684
8742185,2,B018ELUCCC,Overrated! B Grade Type Movie with very poor acting. Not worth the time to view.,1470528000,,80,4.4
8742186,1,B018ELUCCC,"You've got to be kidding me. You can't trust the reviews on Amazon AT ALL anymore! They need to do away with the entire rating system.

I put this in my watchlist because of the ratings but did not read them first. Well I should have read them, because they are clearly all written by fake accounts. They all have the same wording and NO other reviews, ALL are 5 stars, and all are but one are written on the SAME DAY.

The acting in this is horrible, it looks like some middle school kids made it with a cheap camcorder, and there are numerous mistakes (and we only managed to get through the first 15 minutes or so).",1469404800,7,618,4.184873949579832

8742189,1,B018ELUCCC,One of the most boring and one-dimensional movies I have ever seen.  I saw it based on the ratings in amazon which must have been completed by family members.  Don't waste my time or money please.,1458950400,4,196,4.416666666666667
