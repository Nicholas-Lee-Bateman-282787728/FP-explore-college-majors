8180132,5,B000NOK18Y,This is a Goth and Vampyre subculture classic like Razor Blade Smile. Great soundtrack and campy satire. For Gots a Must See.,1394668800,,125,4.7272727272727275
8180133,3,B000NOK18Y,"Movie premise: Goth band tries to make it in a ""battle of the bands"" competition, but the record company is led by a trio of bloodsucking vixens, and their leader takes a particular interest in the lead singer.

The special effects are just bad (one has to see the interspersed CGI animation to see how lame and completely unnecessary it is), and for chrissakes, they didn't make a lot of effort to hide the tubes that show blood spurting.

But let's not lose sight of the fact that this *is* a B movie. Academy Award material, this is not. Cheap thrills with gratuitious carnage and nudity, this is.

The movie isn't a total loss, however. The soundtrack is filled with awesome Gothic music, with bands like Switchblade Symphony and Christian Death among the artists. And despite being little more than eye candy and weighed down by really bad directing and scripts, Gina DeVettori (""Anastasia Nightshade"") and Kristen Zaik (""Jasmine"") turn in decent performances.

If you're a hardcore fan of the vampire genre, or if you like Gothic/darkwave music, this movie is a treat. If not, well... better stick to the Foreign Film section. :)",1204329600,18,1135,4.835051546391752
