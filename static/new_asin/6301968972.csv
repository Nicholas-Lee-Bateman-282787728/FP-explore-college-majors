388465,4,6301968972,"A ""Huckster"" is an American expression for door to door salesman. After WW11,many returning servicemen came home looking for work. Selling household goods, small enough to be carried in a suitcase,door to door,to housewives,was a common reality in the late 40's and 50's. In Australia many homes and businesses soon started putting ""No Hawkers or Canvassers"" signs in their front windows in an effort to dissuade would-be salesmen.
Clark Gable stars as a returned serviceman who gets a job in advertising, whereby the account they are desperate to win is with a company that makes soap,and has it's own radio station. The campaign is worth a lot of money and the Company CEO, a very unpleasant fellow called Evan Evans (Sydney Greenstreet) uses tyrannical means to goad his team into action and get that account at all costs.
Gable meets a war widow (Deborah Kerr) and her two children,and she agrees to be the girl in his soap ad. He soon realises his new lady is all good taste and class and fashions the advertisement to emphasize this - no sheer under wear for her !
There is an unforgettable act committed by Evans in his Boardroom. Quite revolting and shocking. Equally,very effective.
Gable realises he can no longer work for this ogre of a man, even though he needs the income the job supplies, as he wants to marry Kaye (Deborah Kerr) and be a father to her children.
This is a good film with a fine caste, headed by the man once known as the King of Hollywood - Clark Gable, ably supported by the great Deborah Kerr in her first American role, and Sidney Greenstreet as the revolting lounge lizard, Evan Evans, and the sultry Ava Gardner,plus Keenan Wynn and Edward Arnold.

388467,5,6301968972,"Every veteran of the advertising industry is sure to find lots to enjoy and ponder in this Clark Gable-Debra Kerr classic.  The Hucksters was an adaptation of Frederic Wakeman's devastating novel -- rumored to be a roman a clef -- about big-bucks corporate thuggery and Mad Ave skullduggery in the 1940s.

Returning ad executive Clark Gable and impoverished war-widow socialite Debra Kerr try to hang onto their integrity and each other in the freewheeling, utterly unprincipled world of Madison Avenue in the years after World War 2.  They negotiate a minefield of high-stakes ad campaigns, sexually exploitative art directors, abusive CEOs, lickspittle corporate toadies (literally!), and cutthroat ad-agency politics where senior executives are FBI informants who destroy their rivals by ratting them out to the feds.

The media, mores, and strategies of advertising have changed completely since 1947, but the personalities remain the same.  Scenes with Adolphe Menjou as the ad agency owner and unforgettable Sidney Greenstreet as a troglodyte soap tycoon all ring true, even today.  Frederic Wakeman's bestselling novel ""The Hucksters"" was reportedly drawn from life -- years on the corporate floor of the American Brands Company.  His pungent characters emerge intact in this film, and shake the viewer with their authenticity, even now.

The film has some flaws in pacing and it's deliberately morally ambiguous, but it really deserves a DVD release.  What's the problem?",1222732800,2,1479,5.451754385964913
388468,5,6301968972,"The Hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is.  Clark Gable, playing the suave but ethical advertising man, is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon Sydney Greenstreet.  Both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match, each making strategic moves of cunning, self-pride and power--Gable, in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and Greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him.  Greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas Gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product.

Most interesting however is the internal struggle Gable, Kerr, and Gardner are each battling.  Gable, basically a good man, is somewhat of a player and finds himself in love with Kerr.  Kerr, a widow with children, is a righteous woman deeply attracted to Gable but cannot reconcile with his lifestyle.  Gardner, a sultry singer of a sordid background, longs to settle down as a respectable housewife and mother and his her net set for Gable.  All three do a magnificent job of portraying the internal struggles of their characters.

In the end Gable buckles but does not break before the formidable Greenstreet.  Realizing that he cannot continue on working for this tyrant without compromising his standards, Gable passes on the company?s lucrative offer and walks, but not before he has publicly humiliated Greenstreet.

Of course, Gable does get the girl in the end.  Which one?  Watch the movie and find out!",1090368000,12,1717,5.177536231884058
388469,5,6301968972,"""The Hucksters"" is a refreshingly adult drama with themes that resonate even today.  Clark Gable plays an advertising agent (a ""huckster"") who is basically a decent man, but who finds himself increasingly compromising his principles in order to satisfy a despotic soap magnate played by Sydney Greenstreet, who obviously relishes in playing such a despicable, larger than life character.

As part of a promotion for his client's product, Gable convinces a lovely society war widow (sensitively played by Deborah Kerr) to endorse Greenstreet's beauty soap.  Gable is immediately attracted to Kerr and vice versa.

But Gable and Kerr's characters are polar opposites.  He is a driven sometimes ruthlessly ambitious businessman.  She is a very proper, rather sheltered, but highly moral mother of two small children and a widow of a war hero.

In 1947, the year of this film's release, there was still a strong sense of morality in movies (something absent in most of today's films).  The idea of having sex outside of marriage was not considered lightly.  And in ""The Hucksters"", this issue is tastefully dealt with minus the vulgarity and gratuitous sexuality that permeate most of today's films. (Call me old fashioned, but I think we could do without so many explicit sex scenes in movies today.)

There are other contemporary topics in this film such as the power of big business to control the media and the dilemma of ""getting ahead"" in your profession by any means, ethical or not.

Even though this movie is over 50 years old, it holds up extremely well.  It makes for an absorbing two hours.",1028073600,46,1598,4.988679245283019
388470,5,6301968972,"The summation of ad man Clark Gable's reading of the riot act to soap magnate Sydney Greenstreet is just great in this a-one movie about the post-war radio advertising world. Gable has just hung up his uniform--literally--when the show begins, and is ready to resume his radio ad man career. Along the way, he has to tangle with Greenstreet, a really dopey Keenan Wynn, and decide which of two lovely ladies he wants to pursue. Quite a dilemma: the upper-crust war widow Deborah Kerr who seems like she'd be made of ice but is surprisingly warm to the touch, or sultry torch singer Ava Gardner, who might seem like a live wire but secretly yearns for an apron and a man in slippers.  For those who are as confused as Gable as regards the woman issue, have no fear--just check out ""Mogambo"" where once again Gable has to choose between a lady (this time, Grace Kelly) and a, well, not so much of a lady (Gardner again). See both movies together, and you can play out both scenarios.
Really wonderful supporting work by Greenstreet as the overbearing soap dictator, used to making everyone alternately jump and grovel, and by Adolphe Menjou as the beleagured head of the ad agency, who has lost so many of his scruples that he embarrasses his wife in a terribly effective drunk scene in a nightclub double date with Gable/Kerr. Smaller role for veteran Edward Arnold, but just as solid as usual, playing a man who trusts Gable a little more than he ought.
If you're in the mood for great post-war King Gable and a bevy of top-rate supporting players, make a bee line for ""The Hucksters""--and that's no soft soap.",1008806400,18,1610,4.609756097560975
388471,4,6301968972,"Clark Gable zoomed back to the pre-eminent place he long held in Hollywood with this smash performance of Vic Norman, the attractive ""huckster""; a radio advertising go-getter.  He takes with him the lovely English Deborah Kerr, who made her American film debut in this film from 1947.  Nearly everyone read the book by Frederic Wakeman back in the forties; it was very popular.  The Gable-Kerr team is ideal.  Kerr made an impressive bow on the U.S. screen, and the critics took notice.  Sydney Greenstreet is great as Evan Llewellyn Evans, who thinks America as a blank space between New York and Hollywood where people buy soap!  Producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr. garnered top technical talent for this film and Jack Conway's direction is  first-rate.  Ava Gardner is mesmerizingly beautiful as the nightclub singer, Jean Ogilvie.  At the end of the excellent Luther Davis screenplay, Gable gives out with the kind of denunciation of his brow-beating boss that has been standard cinematurgy for years - the script ribs everything in radio of yore from soap operas to Forest Lawn commercials!",1004745600,6,1089,5.073033707865169

388521,5,6301968972,"Brilliantly portrayed by Clark Gable as a huckster of a marketing firm, and beautifully supported by Deborah Kerr as his love interest; this movie is a pleasure to watch.  The story is about Victor Norman (Clark Gable); a war veteran joins an advertising company as their top-notch marketing specialist. In the first assignment, he recruits a war widow, Kay Dorrance (Deborah Kerr) to do a commercial for soap product. This engagement brings into direct conflict with a demanding and autocratic client Evan Llewellyn Evans (Sydney Greenstreet), the owner of the soap manufacturing company. This is a drama of a young marketing recruit battling the giant of the industry to prove a point that money can't buy him.

Deborah Kerr looks absolutely ravishing and Ava Gardner plays a young woman named Jean Ogilvie who is attracted to Victor but saddened to know that his interest is focused on Kay. Director Jack Conway is a master of making drama movies, and he has directed some of the best that includes; Saratoga, A Yank at Oxford, The Gay Bride, Libeled Lady, The girl from Missouri, The red headed woman, Too hot to handle, A star is born, and A tale of the two cities. He worked with Clark Gable and other major stars of the golden era and he is at ease in working with such monumental figures of that time. Highly recommended!

388544,5,6301968972,"Clark Gable is an advertising huckster who doesn't play by the rules. The story revolves around a soap manufacturer who believes he owns the advertising agency he hired body and soul. This old B/W film, set in the late 1940's seems current in its theme of the advertiser's manipulation of the media in order to sell product. Gable's world is complicated when he falls in love with a young war widow (Kerr) and her two children.

Clark Gable and the very young Debra Kerr were OK in this one, but the story left a lot to be desired.

388547,4,6301968972,"You watch ""The Hucksters,"" made some sixty-three years ago, and think the satire in it could have been made today. That's what makes a classic, by definition. My favorite scene is the one in which the Client-From-Hell, Sydney Greenstreet, explains to his cowering staff and ad agency what he thinks makes an effective ad: ""Irritate! Irritate! Irritate!"" You find yourself cringing with them, recognizing the same bullheaded, contemptuous philosophy in today's marketing. I was also touched by the temptation Clark Gable eventually feels to just go along with bullying client, something I have experienced the pull of in my own career in advertising.
