8445260,5,B004WLIHUS,"I lived in three different northern Illinois suburbs in my early years, Western Springs, St. Charles, and Aurora.  I attended Elgin Community College which was near Downtown at that time.  The CA & E was already gone but I traveled the route and often saw abandoned right of way and abutments.  When I was in the working world old timers talked fondly about the CA&E and I could feel the sense of loss.

The video travels every inch of the line and I recognized the buildings along the way and the Fox river links many towns along the route.  Its interesting that today light rail is being built and it is wanted and needed in pretty much the same places where it originally was!",1359504000,,679,4.443548387096774
