8470354,3,B005FNQ4I4,"This is a pretty good Penthouse dvd with at least 2 or 3 scenes that show plenty of vajayjay and girl-on-girl teasing action.  The camera definitely gets in there and unlike with Playboy dvd, you get 4-5 seconds between the thighs instead of 1-second pans across the pelvis and then away.  Lots of legs far apart, or doggie shots, etc to show each girl's assets.  I just wish the action were more consistent...

My two fav scenes are the one in the elevator - girl-on-girl and the nudity is very explicit with good labia close ups and some touching and teasing of each other; the only problem is brevity, like when there's finger stroking you only get ONE pass of fingers over lips, enough to make them move but not enough to stimulate much.  Then it's the Viennese Artist scene that is by far the best and most explicit, with both girls arriving at rubbing and spreading the pink in lingering detail and with nice facial expressions as well (though there is too much clutter in the shots, definitely more instances than needed of the guy's face or the back of his head).  That's what I'd say this dvd needs more of overall - more than one touch on the vj, more than one scene with the kind of action we see all the time in Penthouse photo spreads... but with this same production value and not the cheesy way that most adult movies are filmed now.",1420502400,,1348,4.437246963562753
