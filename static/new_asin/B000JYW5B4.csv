2680565,3,B000JYW5B4,"These are two of my favorite romantic comedies, and it's wonderful having them together at a great price.  However, the video quality of both movies is extremely poor.  If you want to show off your home theater, this is not for you, but if you are just looking to pick up a couple of great movies at a very reasonable price, this I would certainly recommend this set.",1199664000,6,367,4.382352941176471
2680566,5,B000JYW5B4,"DAVE is one of my favorite movies of all time, and what a great price!  I have always enjoyed Kevin Kline, but never knew Sigourney Weaver was such a versatile actress. This is a real ""feel good"" movie.
The American President is a great movie, too. You can't beat the price on this bundle.",1190246400,,289,4.351851851851852
2680567,4,B000JYW5B4,"The American President is a pleasant romantic fantasy featuring a President (Michael Douglas) who plays the Clinton we wanted but, alas, didn't get. The movie is charmingly idealistic; Bening is a treat, and the supporting cast is perfect, Dreyfuss especially enjoyable. Perhaps this movie is the liberal's fantasy, especially poignant these days, but it is also a kind of up dated Frank Capra film, with Good and Romance triumphing.
Dave is even better. Kevin Kline is irrisistable in the role of a President look-alike  (he plays the President as well). With a wonderful sense of comic timing and a splendid script, this impossible story becomes completely believable. Like The American President, this is another Capra-esque story, but here the addition of an average guy put into the Presidential role is a kind of flattery to the audience -yes, we think, we could do that as well. I loved the scene where Kline brings in his old friend to work out the budget as they snack on brats. Supporting cast is terrific. Weaver can be both icy and melting; Langella is intimidating and fierce (and also quite funny), and Rhames is perfect. I should also mention Linney, very funny, and Kingsley, quite touching. But the show belongs to Kline, and he brings it off with brio. A lovely film.",1184284800,5,1285,4.894495412844036
2680568,4,B000JYW5B4,"The American President is far better compared to Dave. The AP has a better story and you would be more likely to watch The AP multiple times compared to Dave which would probably be one of those movies you brought, say huh at the end, and then put it back on the shelf until six months later when you forget if you liked it or not so you watch it again and the process starts over. Besides the cast in the AP is far better than those in Dave. But considering this DVD is only two dollars more than just the American President on its own, its really not a bad buy.",1182902400,,563,4.035714285714286

2680572,3,B000JYW5B4,"American President and Dave are among my favorite movies. 2 great movies on the same dvd !

The quality of the video in these dvds leaves much to be desired.  The quality reminds me of something you would see if you taped the show and you didn't have cable/satelite (antenna) and then tried to use filters to reduce noise. The original DVD release of American President had noise in it too but the picture seems more ""pixelated"" in this release.  I guess since these movies are well over 10 years old a higher quality format doesn't exist?  Actually, My eariler comments about the quality was its appearance on a LCD monitor.  It looks quite decent on TV.

That being said it is very convient having 2 movies on 1 dvd at a great price, so I would recommend this dvd over VHS anyday.",1168214400,48,782,4.433566433566433

2680641,5,B000JYW5B4,A duel favorite of mine.,1455580800,,24,4.0
2680642,5,B000JYW5B4,"Both of these movies are five-star movies in their own rights.

""The American President"" is primarily a drama, showing us a behind-the-scenes look at White House operations during the administration of a widower-President, and the amusement that results when he tries to pretend to be an average guy wooing a woman that he is attracted to. Hilarity sometimes ensues. Despite pressure from his advisers, he does manage to do the right thing. Everything in this movie could happen in real life. In fact, if you read the details that are provided in the Special Features section of this disk, you will see that the producer and other key people involved with this movie were given unprecedented access to the White House during Clinton's administration so that they could do an accurate portrayal of presidential life.

""Dave"" is a presidential movie that could never happen. While I do believe that the Secret Service might occasionally hire a double to protect the President during non-critical occasions, I do not believe they would ever hire a double to actually become the President because key presidential advisers do not like the Vice President.

In ""Dave"" the real President suffers a stroke while Dave covers for him waving to crowds. The Chief of Staff, a greedy-son-of-a-dog, a man you'll grow to hate, decides to hire and train Dave to become the President so that he can eventually become President himself. Eventually, the First Lady sees through the charade, and the two of them take on the renegade Chief and are able to do the right thing.

If you enjoy the premise of ""Dave"" then I highly recommend the book ""Double Star"" by Robert A. Heinlein. It is the story of an actor who is hired to impersonate a highly-ranked politician on Mars who has been kidnapped before a very important adoption ceremony which will cement a new understanding and relationship between Martians and Humans on Mars. I highly recommend this book. It is very logically thought out, and totally could happen, if there were Martians on Mars.

I highly recommend these movies to you. I love them so much, I have watched them both MULTIPLE times, and I will be watching them again.",1455321600,,2168,4.880434782608695

2680726,4,B000JYW5B4,"The two most fun ""President"" movies made in one package. You'll like them both.

Kevin plays an innocent naive look-alike grass roots organizer who is sought out to replace the real Chief when he's seriously stricken ill. New Prez even fools the real President's wife (Sigourney Weaver) though she suspects something is wrong when he's so much nicer than her husband. When the replacement Pres starts changing policy the staff becomes way frustrated and irritated. Problem is, they're the ones who got him to assume the role so the VP wouldn't be allowed to take over.

Michael plays a bachelor President who is attracted to a Washington lobbyist, who happens NOT to be enamored with some of his policies. She accepts a date with him against her better judgement. Yeah, you guessed it. They fall in love, and the press has a field day. Then there's mutual consternation when they disagree on administration policies. Her validity is called into question by the press and her fellow lobbyists as a result of her association with the President.

Both great flicks. Both well acted and directed.",1390176000,,1092,4.923913043478261

2680730,5,B000JYW5B4,"I love these movies.  The American President is a cute love story.  I love it despite it's blatant propaganda.  Republicans are not the bad-guys--and do not engage in ""dirty tricks"".  That is been the M. O. of the democrats  ever since the Republicans formed to end slavery.  Don't believe me?
Check Wall Builders history site.  and American History in Black and White. We had black Founders  too.
When the Whigs and Democrats wanted to keep slavery,
  the men in both parties who wanted to end it formed ""The Republican Party"".
Of course Global Warming has been exposed as a hoax.  It is a very small gradual warming and we DO have the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.  I am very protective of our Constitution.  I have 2 men in my family history who fought for it.
Daughters of the American Revolution.  I just ""switch"" Roles and Goals in the movie, so I can enjoy the sweet funny romance.

2680742,4,B000JYW5B4,"I will start off by saying that I purchased this combo solely for the movie Dave.  I remember watching said movie several years ago and was waiting for it to go down in price before I purchased it.  It stars an actor (Kevin Kline) and actress (Sigourney Weaver) who many people know along with one - Frank Langella who has starred in many other movies. I understand that this is truly a fictional movie but it gives the watcher pretty much an understanding of what may or may not happen within the midst of our government.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie for the humor along with the seriousness.  As for The American President movie starring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, again this was just an added bonus movie purchased.  I did enjoy the movie with the pace and I thought both actors did a great job in their roles.  And again, this is a fictional movie that delves into the inner workings of our government in dealing with re-election.  Finally, I lent the movie combo to my sister to watch and she felt that The American President was more enjoyable than Dave.",1369094400,,1070,4.541666666666667

""The American President"" - Still good but not as entertaining as ""Dave."" Can't beat the total enjoyment factor ""Dave"" brings. Love Kevin Kline!",1366934400,,362,4.484848484848484
2680749,4,B000JYW5B4,"I found The American President to be both humorous and romantic.  There was just enough real drama to hold my attention.  Michael Douglas and Anett Bening made a good pairing for the story of a widowed President finding love is a very unusual way.  It showed how being a public servant can keep you from having a life outside of the public arena.  They meet, they fall in love and they make love while under the  microscope that the press puts all public figures under.  Michael J. Fox was great playing a role as an advocate of the right thing to do.  He always plays such roles with gusto.  It makes you believe he is that sort of person in real life.  Martin Sheen as the Chief of Staff proved to be  a good casting.  I loved him in West Wing.  The movie is one that tells the age old story.  "" Love conquers all"".  The other movie in this package was Dave.  It got three stars from me.  The movie is about a look alike of the president who is called on the stand in for him at a public function but due to a stroke of the real president he has to become the role player to keep the political bad guys on a roll to due the nasty deeds they had planned.  When the president , Kevin Kline sees a program that is meant to help needy kids get gutted by the bad guys, steps in and stops it from happening.  He calls in an accountant he knows well from his small town and has him figure out what should be obvious to everyone where the money can be found to keep the program alive.  This happens to be a pet project of the first lady and draws them together.  Oh if only this would happen in real politics today.  I won't spoil it by telling all of the details but with this particular package you get two movies worth your time to watch.  Good stories and great actors make for a delightful combination.  Enjoy!!",1366243200,,1810,4.137931034482759

Both films feature a great script, funny moments, good acting... and no real strain on the brain... in short, they offered relief, and in my state, relief was rare and relished.

American President is actually a VERY well-written and well acted movie with a lot of heart and although I was disappointed that MJF didn't have a larger part I enjoyed seeing Fox in this small role. Dave, on the otherhand, is one of my favorite movies of all time which I can watch over and over and never get bored with. It's funny, sad, and heart warming. It actually makes you believe that there could be a chance that our government could work if a real person were to be put in the White House. I'd recommend either movie to anyone.

Douglas is monumental in American President, and Annette Benning was the best choice for supporting female.
And of course, Sig Weaver was memorable as the First Lady. The lady is no tramp. She bellied up to the part in glorious style. Kevin Klyne is at his comic best here. He does his own part in creating suspense AND laughter.

The hook in these movies for us was the real-time politics that the writers included. The drama and the flirty romance brought them home to the heart, and this guy doesn't like romantic flicks. No, no.

2680809,5,B000JYW5B4,"So often the combination DVDs have only one movie that is worthwhile, and the other movie or movies are just thrown in with no consideration of their quality. This is especially noticeable with sequels.

In the case of the the American President and Dave combination, each of these movies stands alone as a classic for the future. Together, they are ideal for any collector.

Each of these movies has comedy and romance that is well written and well acted. Yes, they have one other thing in common. One of the major characters is serving as a fictional President of the United States. However, neither of these stories is just a rip off of the other or a rewrite of the same story.

The American President looks at the life of a widow and father, who just happens to be the man in the White House. The politics of re-election, while the world watches him fall in love is the subject. Michael Douglas is a very believeable President, and Annette Bening is a somewhat less talented love interest.

On the other hand, Dave tells of a Presidental look-alike who finds himself suddenly playing the role 'for real'. Again, the world watches, while the main character falls in love with the real First Lady. The great comedian, Kevin Kline, is the perfect common man's version of the President; and Sigourney Weaver plays the part of First Lady to perfection.",1209168000,,1352,4.69198312236287

Politics does not require a big screen. By the time these two uplifting movies have ended, you will be ready for the rehearsed marionettes who appear on the small screen.

2680815,5,B000JYW5B4,"These are two fine comedies to have on a double feature DVD. Both are handsomely produced and quite charming. Frank Capra's presence can be felt strongly in both films, since they mirror his ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in wit, romance & human drama.
""The American President"" has Michael Douglas helming the White House (couldn't you just see him as President?), a widower whose romance with a lobbyist (a spunky & lovely Annette Bening) sparks controversy. From the noble opening credits of presidents past to scenes of White House functions, the film simply sparkles. Rob Reiner deftly directs this often dense excursion into the tangled web of politics, and how it affects everyone. The film is packed with tons of supporting cast turns, as well as cameo appearances from celebrities & political figures alike. And Douglas is given a show-stopping moment as he fires back at a mud-slinging opponent (Richard Drefuss) on national T.V.
""Dave"" is more whimsical than ""The American President"" as it serves up fantasy fulfillment: What if you had the chance to be President for a while? The terrific Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, an ordinary guy that could have very well stepped out of a Capra film. Due to his uncanny resemblance to the Prez, Kovic is tapped to play him during a public function, then is plopped into the White House indefinitely after the real Prez is left comatose after a tryst with his secretary. What develops is how a regular man takes one look at what is going wrong within the administration, and tries his best to fix it; even re-connecting with the Prez's estranged wife, played with stern dignity & charm by Sigourney Weaver. Again, great supporting turns & cameos abound, but the film is clearly Kline's show all the way.
Sadly, there are no bonus extras on this double bill, not even some short featurettes. Nevertheless, these are two wonderful movies about life in the White House worth enjoying over & over again.",1200268800,,1948,4.888217522658611
