What a tragedy for one to have to endure especially considering the fact the brave lad what simply seeking to serve his country.

7839243,3,6303112110,"These are the kind of true stories that make one's blood boil. The coup performed upon Cadet Johnson Whittaker and the subsequent court marshall is but another blight on the landscape of justice in America. The only Negro cadet in West Point was viciously attacked and left for dead. This action was blamed upon Whittaker as a sham which he had staged in order to gain attention and sympathy for his race. What transpires is the actual trial taken from the 12000 pages recorded over several months. The story is quite compelling,but alas the acting definitely is not. The words from A-list actors such as Samuel L.Jackson and Sam Waterston playing Whittaker's lawyers seem stilted and contrived. The blocking and lack of movement in this film are static and uninspired. John Glover so overacts that his role is somewhat laughable. In fact, all of the actors are charicatures of themselves as if they are playing in some unprofessional community theater! As an excellent informational piece,this made for TV drama excels,but for execution it suffers terribly for it's 95 minutes.",1175990400,3,1078,5.027932960893855
7839244,5,6303112110,"One night I was browsing in the drama section at Hollywood videos looking for a good movie starring a well known black actor (Samuel L. Jackson is an excellent choice).  Well to make a long story short, the moive was excellent the cast was put together well for a historical account of the incident at West Point in the 1880's.",997315200,4,327,4.45
7839245,3,6303112110,"This video is a good historical story line regarding the court marshal of a West Point black Cadet.  It is a true account of what took place at that time.  Interesting for those interested in history.  Not very good acting.  We enjoyed the movie, but we are also interested in West Point history.",929750400,5,296,4.528301886792453
