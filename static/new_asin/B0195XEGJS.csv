7563448,3,B0195XEGJS,"Lets be honest.  This great looking movie isn't for mainstream movie goers.  Its built for critics and a small segment of the public.  Eddie Redmayne, coming off last years Oscar win for The Theory of Everything is back in the physical transformation business.  As he did for Stephen Hawking's physical maladies, Redmayne makes the transformation from a man to a woman, but it is slow, simmering a bit too long.

Redmayne plays Einar Wegener, an acclaimed Danish artist, who is married to Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina and The Man from Uncle).  Gerda, also an artist, is having a difficult time getting her work in galleries.  The pair is outwardly a perfect couple and in fact is trying hard to have a baby.  But something is amiss as Einar is fascinated by Gerdas undies and in fact, womens clothes in general.  Directed with patience by Tom Hooper, the film is beautiful to look at.  The cinematography was done by Danny Cohen (Room and Les Miserables) and plays a significant role in creating the backdrop and settings for the film.  Some of the shots seem almost paintings in their own right, sequenced properly with the various art galleries of Europe.

To some extent, the film reminds me of one of my favorite movies of 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road.  Let me explain that seeming juxtaposition.  I was expecting to see Tom Hardy stand out, but it was really Charlize Therons Furiosa who made the movie.  Here, we knew Redmayne was a good actor and his protracted physical and mental metamorphosis into Lili Elbe does nothing to tarnish that reputation.  But it is Ms. Vikander who is really the star of the film.  Admittedly, I was already a fan as the aforementioned Ex Machina is my favorite film of the year, but I wasn't expecting this.  Her portrayal of the young artist, deeply in love with her husband tugs at the heartstrings as she supports his transgender surgery, knowing that the man she married will die, regardless of the medical success or failure.

The film has a strong supporting cast including Amber Heard (Magic Mike XXL) as Ulla, a friend of the couple and society queen.  Ben Whishaw (In the Heart of the Sea and Spectre) plays Henrik, a gay early flirtation of Einar/Lili and Matthias Schoenaerts (Far from the Madding Crowd) is Hans, a childhood friend of Einar who supports the couple.  I loved the look of the movie and the strong performances, but I thought the story was a bit shallow, and a bit safe.  Oh, and one last thing.  Alicia Vikander is a much better looking woman than Eddie Redmayne.",1452038400,2,2539,4.6945701357466065
7563449,4,B0195XEGJS,"""The Danish Girl"" (2015 release from the UK; 119 min.) brings the story of a couple from Denmark, Einar and Gerda Wegener. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Copenhagen 1926"", and we get to know the couple, both painters, albeit that the husband is well-known, while the wife is stuck in her husband's shadow. Then, one day, in a playful way, the husband cross-dresses, and the wife plays along. But it isn't long before this becomes much more than a game. How far will the husband push this? Will the wife be supportive? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from British director Tom Hooper, who previously hit bull's eye with ""The King's Speech"" and then ""Les Miserables"". Here, he tackles another topic that one could sarcastically view and nothing but Oscar-bait, but in reality goes far beyond it, as the issue of transgender has reached the news headlines, and not always for the right reason. Others have commented already on the fact that this story strays from the actual events quite a bit (interestingly, the movie does not claim to be ""based on true events"", which movies typically tend to do). Second, Eddie Redmayne, who just last year won the Best Actor Oscar for his incredible performance in ""The Theory of Everything"", tries to do one better yet as the cross-dressing/transgender Lily/Einar. Instead of being bowled over by his performance, I was strangely put off by what felt to me was overacting on Redmayne's part, I mean he is TRYING SO HARD. Compare that instead to the tender performance from Swedish actress Alicia Vikander as the wife. Vikander shone earlier this year already in ""Ex Machina"", and in my view she steals the movie from Redmayne. The other noteworthy, if much smaller, role is from Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts, as the couple's friend. Third, the movie was shot in multiple international locations. Being originally from Belgium, I thought that many scenes taking places in Paris looked rather familiar, and indeed, when the end credits roll, it confirmed what I suspected, namely that most of the Paris scenes were actually shot in Brussels, which has a remarkable amount of well-preserved street scenery from the 1920s-30s. Last but certainly not least, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Oscar-winning French composer Alexandre Desplat (yes, he FINALLY won the Oscar last year, after 7 previous nominations).

The movie finally expanded nationally, and given all the buzz around this film, I had pretty high expectations going in. I'm sorry to say that for me the movie simply did not meet those expectations. Is this a 'bad' film? Of course not. But I simply was not able to get emotionally invested in many of the characters, including the lead character. And it is clear that Alicia Vikander is going to be a major star. Warts and all, I encourage you to check out ""The Danish Girl"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1452038400,,3097,4.874762808349146
7563450,5,B0195XEGJS,"This movie is very impressive. The acting is excellent and the images are breathtaking. The artworks in the movie are beautiful.
I found the story to be very compelling and sad in a way. I was trying hard to hold back my tears at the end of the movie.
I read in other comments that the movie is not like the book it has been adapted from. To me that does not take away from the beauty and the emotion in this film. This is a movie and not a book.
I was very moved by The Danish Girl and it is still on my mind after seeing it two days ago. I preordered the DVD because I definitely will want to see this again.",1451865600,,610,3.888

7563453,3,B0195XEGJS,"A number of folks have already commented on how the movie differs from the source material, but I have no idea and cannot comment or be influenced by that.  I can only react to the film, which I give 3.5 stars.

This story of one of the first persons to undergo gender reassignment surgery is lovely, yet often sterile.  Sometimes moving, often holding the viewer at arms length.  It's tough to describe why this movie is only a 3.5 star affair, but in a nutshell, I think it's because the best performed and in many ways most interesting & sympathetic character in the film is treated poorly by the supposed most interesting character.  Our sympathies fall to a character that is not the focal point of the film.

In this story, set in the 1920's, we have a happily married couple (Eddie Redmayne & Alicia Vikander), both artists, though Redmayne more successful.  We explore their marriage, and only gradually come to see that all is not well.  Redmayne is attracted to wearing women's clothing, and clearly aroused by it.  His game wife has no issues allowing her husband to enjoy his sexuality as best suits him, and they even make a game of having his go out in public as his ""alter-ego"" Lilly.  But Redmayne finds it more and more difficult to go back to being a man, and what at first seemed like a case of good old cross-dressing is revealed to be much more wrenching...Redmayne is a transgender.  He goes to see specialists, who are all prepared to have him committed.  His devoted wife spends time frustrated at him/her...she no longer has a husband to share physical pleasure with, and that drives her crazy.  She also has a husband who is now almost single-minded in his interests...he only wants to be Lilly and only cares about exploring that.  His wife continues to love this person deeply, but they cannot help but drift apart.  Yet the pain of this drifting seems one-sided:  Redmayne is just totally into his transformation and being a women.  He scarcely seems to understand that he has essentially killed his wife's husband.  Vikander is tormented...she understands what has happened and is supportive and loving (to a point), but it also torn up.  Hence, she becomes our object of sympathy, and Redmayne becomes a source of frustration.  It's perhaps not fair, but in part I think the script and Vikander's beautiful performance put Redmayne at a disadvantage.  He is very good, and has the flashier role, certainly.  But Vikander is the beating heart of the film, and to my mind, she deserves more recognition for her ""supporting"" role (a role just as big as Redmayne's).

So, the film is beautifully filmed, lovingly costumed, and well-acted by its leads (up-and-coming period-piece hunk Mattias Schoenaerts fares less well here in a bland role).  What more could the viewer wish for?  Well, as I said, the filmmakers don't seem to quite understand that their film's true star is Vikander, so she gets short-shrift at the end.  In addition, I did not feel the movie made a convincing transition from the Redmayne who likes to wear women's clothing to the Redmayne who IS a woman trapped in a man's body.  Transgenderism is, I feel, understandably difficult to understand if one is not going through it.  It is an alien condition and hard to fathom.  Perhaps it's impossible to pull off...but the film could have helped us understand more deeply.  It stilll felt a bit like Redmayne just wanted the surgery because he really wanted his cross-dressing to be convincing.  (I know this may sound uncaring of me...I don't mean it to be.  I have immense sympathy for anyone who truly believes/knows that they are in the wrong body.  But REDMAYNE, specifically, rarely seemed more than petulant and self-absorbed, rather than truly wracked with conflict and turmoil.  Again, Vikander played her role with more depth and heart and nuance.)

By all means, this is a film that should be seen.  It is always interesting, and often affecting.  It falls short of some lofty goals...but the valiance of the attempt has merit.  And I really think we're seeing a star being born in Vikander.  She is SO different from her fascinating performance in EX MACHINA.  I can't wait to see what she does next. And I really need to buy TESTAMENT OF YOUTH right now!)",1451520000,4,4264,4.7639836289222375
7563454,4,B0195XEGJS,"This movie is about a man and a woman who are both painters. The husband is the more talented one, and the wife strives for recognition of her talents. What is an innocent game of dress-up between the two soon turns into hard reality: the husband is actually a woman trapped in the body of a man. At first the couple are in denial, and then gradually we observe the way both come to terms with this reality in their own way. Along this path, the wife receives recognition as an artist because her husband discovers his/her transgender identity. I like how the movie explores her struggle with having received what she had wished for all along, and it being nothing like what she had imagined it to be.

This movie is made up of two stories: the first story (depicted by the husband) speaks of an identity crisis, and what it is like to have two different, but equal forces struggling inside you. I saw it as a metaphor for discovering a part of you in later adulthood, and having to turn your life upside down in order to accommodate that part of you.  The hard part was choosing between the old and the new you.

The other story is depicted by the wife: she had to decide whether to turn away from this stranger who was once her husband, after he had hurt her deeply, and while he was vulnerable. I really admired the way she selflessly stuck by his side as long as she could. Every inch that Eddie took, she lost. But she was depicted as the stronger character right from the beginning.

The casting was really good in this movie. Eddie Redmayne does a perfect side eye squint that utterly makes the film: he channels femininity through that signature gesture.",1451088000,8,1662,4.439344262295082
7563455,4,B0195XEGJS,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Danish Girl""

1. I have rarely been so conflicted about a movie as I am about this one.

2. If I had to describe the actual movie in one word, it would be ""exquisite"". If I had eight more words, they would be ""one of the best movies of the year"". But if I had ten more words, they would be ""why did they change so much of the real story?""

3. The movie is a pseudo-biography of Lili Elbe, one of the first known transgender women to undergo sex reassignment surgery. And that's exactly the problem - it is a pseudo-biography. The movie is not based on Lili's journals or the couple's real story - it's based on a fiction book about Lili.

4. The plot is about two married painters, Gerda and Einar Wegener, in 1920's Copenhagen. A series of small, random events slowly leads Einar to realize that he is really a woman. This challenges everything the two of them know.

5. The movie is amazingly well-balanced in its treatment of the subject of transgender identity. It stays true to what being transgender means, but also respectfully portrays the realistic difficulties that people in the transgender person's life grapple with. Even the people that try to ""fix"" Lili are not portrayed as villains, just ignorant of a complicated reality.

6. I have come to the conclusion that Eddie Redmayne is one of the best actors on the planet. Not only did he give the best performance of 2014 in ""The Theory of Everything"" (he's actually the only reason to watch that movie), he gives the best performance of 2015 in this movie. I understand the criticism that maybe they should have cast an actual transgender woman in the role of Einar/Lili, but I'm not sure I agree with that. Redmayne does a masterful job of reaching the common humanity that exists in everyone.

7. Since both Wegener's were painters, painting is a large element of the movie. And in a work of visual genius, many of the movie's scenes are composed as paintings themselves. Sometimes it's hard to focus on the story because the picture itself is so beautiful.

8. The ending of the movie is a little overbaked, but the rest of the movie is strong enough to make me overlook that.

9. It's really hard for me to be OK with the fact that they didn't stick to Einar/Lili's real story. But if you look at the movie as a work of art, and not of history, this is a deeply layered, nuanced meditation on gender roles, identity, love, sexuality, commitment, loneliness, and confusion. It's about being human.",1451001600,207,2496,4.541202672605791
7563456,3,B0195XEGJS,"Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl is an important film, but is it necessarily a good one? As the conversation around transgender people intensifies and enters further into the mainstream, a film like this is essential in the same way Brokeback Mountain was key in changing hearts and minds about homosexual men. To that end, Hooper's overly-restrained and wispy style, coupled with a fairly straight-forward biopic narrative, may be the perfect fit for making the film palatable to audiences. But it also prevents the film from being as revelatory as it should be, especially given the transcendent performances that do justice to such a meaningful story.

From the moment Eddie Redmayne was confirmed to play Lili Elbe, the first recipient of sexual reassignment surgery, the calls have been out there for him to earn his second Best Actor victory. And that may be the case as he's once again terrifically genuine and subtle, especially opposite Alicia Vikander who is gaining similar notices for her work as Elbe's incredibly devoted wife. If only the screenplay by Lucinda Coxon, adapting the book by David Ebershoff, was half as courageous but instead it goes with the safest possible route.

The 1920s-set story begins with famous landscape artist Einar Wegener (Redmayne), who shared an idyllic life and marriage in Copenhagen with wife, Gerda (Vikander), an aspiring artist of her own. She's more interested in painting portraits, but when she can't find a model for a particular piece she turns to Einar to model as a woman. The sensation in his eyes upon feeling the soft touch of female garments is like an awakening of the spirit. Something inside him has been unleashed and can't be bottled back up. With the help of their ballerina friend (Amber Heard), Einar's alter ego is christened ""Lili""and it isn't long before she begins to dominate their lives. Einar practically disappears as Lili takes over, leaving Gerda to wonder what has happened to her husband. At one point she practically begs to see her husband again, but Einar is so far gone into becoming Lili that he simply refuses. He wants to live a life as Lili, as the woman he feels himself to be, even if that destroys his once-perfect marriage.

The tract Hooper and Coxon take in presenting Elbe's self-actualization is unsubtle, painted in the kind of broad strokes that often hamper these kinds of biopics. For example, he captures the duality within Einar/Lili with a prevalence of mirroring shots, including one scene where Einar mimics the actions of a female dancer. Hooper shoots them with grace, naturally, but then again he shoots everything that way even when the scene doesn't necessarily demand it. Some might say he's got too light of a filmmaking touch, but that also fits the desire to keep this complicated story as uncomplicated as possible.

The film is at its most compelling when it dares to explore Lili's impact on others, and society's view of her existence. We're talking about 1926 when doctors were throwing women into insane asylums with shocking regularity for common ailments, so one can imagine what they thought of Einar/Lili, who leaped from more than a few windows to escape being locked away. There's also Lili's brief dalliance with a handsome man (Ben Whishaw) that forces her to reevaluate what she wants from a relationship standpoint. That causes friction with Gerda, whose painting career has unexpectedly taken off based solely on her images of Lili. Another interesting avenue finds Lili discovering what life as a woman is really like just as she reconnects with an old friend (the always-great Matthias Schoenaerts) who Einar shared an intimate moment with years earlier.

There aren't many actors who would take on the challenge of playing Lili Elbe, and fewer still who could pull it off with the kind of ease Redmayne does. He's simply a marvel when embracing such outwardly physical roles and this one is arguably more demanding than his turn as Stephen Hawking. It requires more nuances in his movements, especially during the phase where Einar is learning to become Lili. Once again he's paired up with an actress who more than holds her own opposite him, with Vikander showing Gerda to be a true beacon of strength and resolve, even as she's coping with her husband's transformation. Vikander has had the kind of year any actress dreams of, and this is a great way to put a cap on it.

Perhaps there's no easy way to present this story and keep it palatable to mainstream audiences. Although it's rather sad that audiences need to be catered to in that way, it's an unfortunate reality when it comes to such an issue. With the emergence of Caitlyn Jenner into the national spotlight, The Danish Girl is in a perfect position to open a few eyes about transgenderism, and while it doesn't push the envelope as far as one might hope, it admirably takes the first steps in moving the discussion forward and opens the door for more films on this subject.",1450656000,96,4971,4.904875148632581

7563467,1,B0195XEGJS,"Man-o-man, what a real stinker!  Wooo-weee, either I was in a really bad mood or this movie stunk my cousins house to high heaven!  Seriously, what the hell was that smell all about?!  I pride myself on staying in the know with what movies come out each week, so I was pretty stoked to stumble across this and not know anything about it.  Based on the DVD cover it was VERY obvious what type of movie Id be getting, so, feeling in the mood for a silly sex-farce, I had this flick sent to me.  Having seen it now, I can say that this was, by far, the worst comedy Ive seen this year... maybe even this quinquennial!  Even the friggin' outtakes on the DVD weren't funny.  PA-THE-TICK!

This movie was sucha poor man's rehash of NUTTY PROF and JOWANAMAN, but made into a typical ""let's be serious about a dude dressed as a danish lady"" movie.  Boy-o-boy was I duped by this movie!  Again, the cover shows a goofy man dressed as a woman, which promises good times in the form of a gender-swap farcical comedy, ala Big Mommas House Trilogy.  So I naturally went in expecting to see lots of people going in and out of doors, close calls with people seeing the dude undressed, embareassing situations, and a heartfelt ending where the two main characters fall in love and then the movie immediately transitions to hilarious bloopers .

Man-o-boy was I sad when none of this happened!  The movie did start off with some classic mistaken identity when E.D. Redmaine is dared to dress up as a woman and then convinces others of his gender!  Sadly, this is the point in the movie when the humor goes buh-bye.  Not only are the supposed jokes here totally unfunny (to the point I wondered if they were intended as jokes) they honestly question whats morally acceptailble in a comedy.  I get how you can commit to a joke in a movie (case and point that sweet SISTERS scene when that dude falls bumcrack first on that wind up ballarena and the hillarous aftermath), but committing to the joke so much that one gets gender change surgery was total overkill!  It was kinda funny for the first phase dingus remove surgery, but doing the second phase was waaaaay too much!  Over the top does NOT equal funny, just ask my comic friend Ken. Though something tells me hes watching this film right now, taking notes, and nodding his head in disapproval in heaven.

Along with the lack of jokes and farcy stuff, there is a big glaring plot hole noone ever bothered to explain!  Why do they call him The Danish Girl?!  He never fricken ate any danishes that I saw!  Not even one!  Based on the tittle, Im not wrong in assuming this guy would be porking down on pasteries from morning till night!  Heck, I eat more danishes from my apartment vending machine in one afternoon than this dude did in his entire life!  Duh Hell!  How this movie grossed over... is it $80 Billion, is beyond me?  Wow!

I do want to take a moment to make a quick shout out to some of my peeps... they truly helped make this movie bearable!  Found those little yellow marshmallow basterds in my cousins couch cushion while I watched the movie.  Hell yes I did eat them, hell yes they were pre 2017 halloween sweets, and hell yes they were delicious!  So, inconclusion, if you are looking for a good hard R sexy farce comedy that's got the heart and ends happily with some cray cray bloopers, puhleeze pass on this!

I have only recently learned about what its like to be born Transgender and my heart goes out to those born that way. I have tried to influence those I've heard express unkind opinions, but I realize many don't know better. I enjoyed this much more than I would have a few years ago, and I fell in love with all the characters for being so understanding in a time one would never expect to see it.  I must believe poor ""Lily"" suffered much more adverse attention than she had in this film--She was very lucky for having such loving friends support and care for her.

I was immediately interested in finding out more about Lili Elbe's life, and discovering that the film is by no means a documentary still didn't ruin it for me.  Director Tom Hooper weaves emotion, the historical period and the fantastic performances so seamlessly that the film more than stands on its own.

7563573,4,B0195XEGJS,"This movie was about Alicia Vikander's acting not Eddie Redmore's. She had more screen time, greater depth of emotion, and she carried the story.
Eddie got the bulk of the ratings but that is because he is a man, and women still play second fiddle in the movie world. Lili played by Eddie, was depending on your beliefs, either mentally ill, transgender or a homosexual. In 1929 having either of the just mentioned could get you killed. But also in 1929, birth control was ineffective compared to our time. Women often had one or more lady friends who secretly took care of their needs. Men who engaged in the same behavior could end up dead.
Alicia managed to show her unclothed body several time from her breasts, to her behind and fleeting views of her frontal anatomy. Do not misunderstand, she is beautiful. In this movie her naked scenes were justified, not like her exposure in other movies where she is shown naked for the sake of showing her body, period. My objection of  Alicia is her smoking cigarettes. I strongly suspect that she is paid by the tobacco industry to smoke. It is obvious to me that she does not smoke in real life. She claims she supports cancer research, but smokes in her movies. In 1929 almost no women smoked.
Eddie also had a naked screen when he placed his gentiles between his legs so he looked like a woman. A clinical name exists for that behavior but I forget it at this time. It showed that he has an ample tool, if that means anything to anyone. Regardless, every male on earth has done the same thing out of curiosity or as part of a ritual.
All in all, it was a good movie and entertaining. But again, The star was Alicia, Eddie.",1483747200,,1672,4.4640522875816995

7563583,2,B0195XEGJS,"On the surface this is a great movie: it's beautiful and artful.

As a transgender individual myself, it was interesting to watch the life of this Danish girl as she figures out that she's transgender. Eddie Redmayne (Einar/Lili) does a great job at displaying dysphoria and some of the struggles of feeling trapped in the wrong body! There is a scene where Lili runs to a theater and undresses in front of a mirror and tucks her appendage between her legs so that she can see what she'd look like without it. OMG!! I can relate to this so much! (this is the ONLY reason I gave the movie two stars). Someone really did their research or has actual experience in that regard.

Here's my problem: the movie was recommended to me by a coworker who knows that I am transgender. There was a ""two person"" element of the Danish Girl's character that is off putting. Her wife BEGS her to go get Einar (the husband) and Lili refuses to do so. The direction made is seem like the Danish Girl had Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder): As if the Lili and was simply an alter and that they switched from one to the other. This is NOT what it means to be transgender and I found it to be a little offensive. Now, I'm concerned that my coworker thinks this is what has happened with me.

At first, I liked the movie for its portrayal of the spouse's struggle (which was strikingly similar to what my own spouse went through). However, the longer I thought about the movie the more I began to despise it. Others may feel differently about how transgenderism is displayed but I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone I know who isn't partially woke: my own mother would get the wrong idea about transgender individuals if she watched this movie.",1483401600,2,1764,4.523510971786834

7563588,3,B0195XEGJS,"Having read the book and after looking forward to the movie for some time, I was disappointed that I just couldn't connect to the characters and the story as I had hoped I would. I like both starring actors, and they performed very well, but I felt there was some kind of distance between me and the story. Eddie Redmayne's mannerisms as Lily were offputting, sort of like how some trans people I know try to act ""feminine"" but it doesn't quite come across. If only they would realize that they just have to act like they normally do--not all women are extreme examples of whatever ""femininity"" is supposed to be--with the fluttering eyelashes, downcast gaze, hands hanging in midair with nothing to do. But, what bothered me most was the actors talking in whispers throughout the movie. What is that about? I've noticed it recently in TV shows, too. It seems to be an acting technique that's become popular, but it bugs the heck out of me.

Eddie and Alicia floor me with their performances, I could not break away. As a painter, the lighting, landscapes, framing and emphasis on the artwork was such an essential and well-executed part of the whole film. As stated earlier, this film is wonderfully balanced in showing both sides of the story: Lili's struggle to be herself, and the struggle of Gerda to understand+support Lili while letting her husband go. I want to watch it again. I feel as if I could watch it as a silent film just to enjoy further the subtly of Redmayne's presence. And look out for that smile",1482278400,,765,4.591240875912408

However, the story did not portray a believable or very credible portrayal of this persons transition into a female.  It seemed to be more an exercise in ""dressing up,"" and focusing on feminine trappings and clothes than psychologically transition into being a woman. Also, the medical and psychological stuff going on just showed how this fairly naive person spiraled into self-destruction unnecessarily. It makes one think there must have been more to that part of the story.  What was really going through her mind at that point?

The third time I talked my transgender son into watching it with me. He didn't want to but after the movie started, he/she watched avidly.

I've seen Eddie Redmayne in a couple other things (Les Miserable comes to mind), but not as a tour de force, leading man, major actor like this!  I don't want to say too much about it because it's the type of movie that one should see for one's self.  I'm almost tempted to say, giving this movie a review would ruin it for someone who really would like to, or should see it.  It's that good.  Alicia Vikander is nothing to sneeze at either! She is fabulous as well!  I saw her in the newer ""Anna Karenina"" movie with Kiera Knightly and loved her in that, so it was a pleasure seeing her in this.

7563739,4,B0195XEGJS,"I thought the acting was good, story/dialogue were just okay... something was missing.  My interest in movies like The Danish Girl are about the relationships between the people, not the events or even who those people might be.  I simply enjoy the voyeuristic aspect of watching people navigate their worlds.  I can watch an animated movie and get just as deeply involved if the dialogue and characters are full enough, believable enough.

So, the relationship between Gerda and Einar at times disappointed me and threw me off... I try to imagine how complicated it would be to discover your spouse is transgender but to lose your spouse to other lovers... that would be insult to injury.  I don't believe for a second that Einar wasn't sexually attracted to Gerda and he was certainly in love with her, they were deeply in love... and maybe his attraction was simply because he was deeply in love with her.  People are not so limited by gender roles that they can never have any flexibility -- that's part of the problem with labels.  And, surely Gerda and Einar would have shared more, known more about each other given they were artists and so attached to each other... I find the relationship between creative artsy people to be no mistake, I think they often seek the other out because they don't like and can't embrace their art when society puts limitations on who they are... like putting them in a box... these are people that express the world around them and whether that personality comes first or their work creates it I'm not sure...  and this is a big piece for me, because I had issue with what wasn't said or done and therefore, I had a hard time believing all the emotion between the two as Lili was dying...

The gender roles, again, don't matter to me, it's the relationship between the two people and how it is evolves... the things the characters do, the way they choose to love or reject some one... their limitations, immaturity or inability to grow with another... and, something was missing for me between Gerda and Einar. Maybe the two actors didn't really like each other... I don't know but I didn't feel the love. Well, and in all honesty, I was more attracted to Gerda's character than Einar.  I liked her strength and determination and I thought they did Einar a disservice to make him and Lili appear so fragile... the courage it took, the rebellion, the conviction, the risk to bring Lili to life was nothing to blush about... such a brave heart.  I kind of think maybe the director wasn't as comfortable as he needed to be... and consequently, he was guilty of putting his own frame work (box) around what it means to be transgender or feminine... even with his ""ground breaking"" movie.  I know, I know, we all have our biases...  anyway, Alicia Vikander was incredible!",1468713600,2,2806,4.667342799188641
7563740,5,B0195XEGJS,"I cannot praise this movie highly enough. It is the story of the woman who was most l likely the first transwoman to submit to surgery.
I give special kudos for having Eddie Redmayne play the main character, as so many movies, (TransAmerica, e.g.) have a woman play the transwoman. He shines in his transformation, and, as a transwoman myself, the moments of his awakening to the her inside, her true self, are so perfectly done, so intimate, so subtle, yet so familiar to those of us who did not know until we were adults. Some critics have said that the movie is ""slow"", but my response is it is perfectly paced as a journey of self-discovery. Redmayne deserved the Oscar he earned for this role.
What I especially love is how this shows how difficult things were in her time, as opposed to today, when ""transgender"" is almost a household word. This move is for two audiences: those who just love superb cinematic art and those who are/or have been questioning their own sexuality, that is, the gender assigned them at birth. I could go on and on about superb books regarding this topic, but this film is very very special.

It contains way too many ""poses""  to the point where you really notice it.

I've not seen The Relativity of Everything yet which Mr. Redmayne won an Oscar for last year, nor have I seen The Revenant which Leo DiCaprio won the Oscar for this year. I hope Leo's Oscar was truly earned, because Eddie Redmayne should have run away with the Oscar for this role! Lol

Woops, I had not seen or heard of the video as out here in the bush its a quiet life with small interruptions.  So I ordered the DVD and than was hooked as I personally know there is more to this story and you can only do so much with the mass of material in hand to produce a 2 hour DVD.  The DVD was great and well worth the time spent watching it.  Having walked the walk I had to research the book and other details.  Sad to say Lili is only available on Kindle so I had settle for the book.  I was not disappointed, each had this value.  The sadness in both the book and DVD story line is that Lili was very much alone and was trying to make separate personalities/persons of both the male and female.  As a mental Health Professional  I concur with the author in his summation of Lili and the death of her male self.  Its not possible to ignore where one comes from and of those life experiences, its who we are the total some.  I honor all that I am and the journey, as the Medical staff I dealt with asked me, ""why are you here?""  My answer was ""to become a whole person""  This is all Lili wanted but at the time as for many of us finding the pathway to success there is  difficulty.",1461456000,,1328,3.981060606060606

7563996,5,B0195XEGJS,"I read an article which spoke of the directors who were considered for The Danish Girl prior to Tom Hooper, and which also said Nicole Kidman had been considered to play Lili Elbe. Thank heaven none of that happened! Tom Hooper is a gifted director and, well, I can't imagine how poor this film would have been with Kidman as Lili, or with any actress attempting to portray a man transitioning to a woman. Eddie Redmayne was a perfect choice. He is becoming known for taking on challenging and complicated roles, and he has brought depth and feeling to every character he has done so far. I too, feel he should have received the Oscar for this one. Alicia Vikander was outstanding as Gerda; in fact, the entire cast was superb, along with all the makeup artists, costumers and set designers. I had not heard of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe or her pioneering struggle to become who she actually was, until seeing this film. The movie is so engaging, and Redmayne's portrayal of Lili so sensitive and riveting, that I am now reading everything I can find on her.",1460937600,,1055,4.617021276595745

I am not one who is hung up on the veracity of the story. I knew nothing about Gerda and Einar before this, so were it nor for this movie, I'd still be ignorant. The flick gets no points off for that from me.

Redmayne is good. He does a great job of showing the conflict of a man who feels like a woman, then blossoms into one. There are many complex emotions that go into the role and he pulls them off. At no time does he ever convince me he IS a woman. He's just too big and too masculine, yet I think that's appropriate. He IS a man.

The picture itself is artistic and lovely- that's appropriate too as the main characters are artists.

I think the reason that it didn't jerk me into high emotion is that it's too even handed. The psychiatric treatment should have been a horror show. The beating in the park should have been horrific. The break up should have been a tear jerker. The first operation should have been a high. They weren't. They just happened.

Is it an important movie? Yes. Is it well done? Yes. Is it great? I'd say no. See it. Enjoy it. Just don't expect to be blown away.",1460073600,,1129,4.136986301369863

7564041,4,B0195XEGJS,"As with most biopics, this a film you see for the performances.  Going in you know the basic story, so you rely on the performances to draw you in.  Does this film have that?  I would say yes.  The most captivating and emotional of the performances is that of Alicia Vikander.  I had a lot of sympathy for her character as she struggled to understand what her husband is going through.  Vikander takes us through a very deep emotional journey, and is very deserving of the Oscar she received.  Eddie Redmayne also gives a strong performance which, much like his role as Steven Hawking last year, was very physical.  Most of his scenes involve watching him attempting to feel comfortable in his own skin.  The difficulty of this is undoubtedly high, and Redmayne must be commended for delivering such a convincing and powerful performance.  At the end of the day, however, Vikander outshines him.  Not a happy movie by any means, but an emotional one, and definitely worth a look.",1459296000,,979,4.7

7564150,5,B0195XEGJS,"This film was made as a re-creation of the life of Lily Elba, a Danish born male, with severe gender dysphoria.  Basically this DSM4,5 diagnosis
is for a person with a biological sex, that desires to live permanently and legally as the opposite sex and gender.  In most parts of the world and in
most states of the United States, medical & surgical intervention is necessary to create a medically acceptable and legally binding gender change.
I spent twenty years studying this condition with psychologists and medical people.  In 2009, I myself, under went the SRS or GRS; from born male
to accepted female. My surgery followed the pioneering work of surgeons in Denmark and around the world.  In 2009, I was following the surgical
path of Lily Elba, some eighty years of medical advances later.  I obviously survived the six hour surgery, that is commonplace today in the USA, as well as in the Far East.  No, I am not famous.  Christine Jurgenson in 1953 became famous for a documented successful sex change.  Now that I claim expert status from living a Lily Elba life., I give the film good marks on content  and accuracy.  Yes violence is always present in a  binary gendered society.  Lost of spouse and family support is very real; Everybody's story is different but all too real and painful.  I had to purchase this film and review it.  Eighty years ago in pre-Hilter Europe, everything was against this social change.  But this incredibly uphill battle  against all odds is the hallmark of Gender Dysphoria even today.  This was the mission of the film to tell a true human story with grave social impact on others, like wives.  And it only happens more frequently today; somewhat with more compassion from society.  Personally, I had a good experience with Social Security and other State and Federal governments.  There is today, 80 years later than Lily Elba, a roadmap for the transition that Lily needed.  The ending of the film I predicted knowing the surgical risks, Lily died as the procedure was too experimental and risky.  However the pursuit of transsexuals is always strong.  I found out that I stopped breathing on the OR table, only by receiving a bill from a pulminologist called to assist.  Not a soul was ever concerned; it is so routine today.  My own sister told me that I would not like this film because I was actually living it..  Bad Attitude! One should not  live life with your head in the sand.  Apparently, in writing this review, I live open and free. Great film with great acting all around.",1458604800,20,2531,4.71689497716895

The performances were so breathtaking and so heartbreaking at times how anyone cannot see this film and not be moved is beyond me.  Eddie once again takes on a roll and loses himself in it, becoming the person he is playing so well that he almost disappears into the person.

7564209,4,B0195XEGJS,"This movie is on the depressing side, but somebody clearly put a lot of thought in it far above and beyond quantifying exactly how much T&A it needed. I'm a bit unclear as to why Vikander looked so much better in the movie than she did on the red carpet. Maybe the movie makers understand her beauty better than she herself does.  Eddie Redmaine plays an artist and husband who needs to be a woman.  There ensues then a competition between he and his wife to see who can suffer the most from this (at the time the movie depicts) impossible challenge.  Whatever love Redmaine's character has for his wife does not stop him from dumping her at his will and convenience.  In the meantime, a friend of the Redmaine's character then gets no love from Redmaine's tortured wife. But the acting is worth watching, and there is a lushness to the cinematography that makes the movie worthwhile.  And finally, as I said, someone who made the movie was looking to fill us up with ideas to ponder, rather than just entertain us.",1458086400,,1015,4.524590163934426

Stepping away from this storyline and, rather, watch how these two perform? It's pretty amazing acting. It's like saying ""I love watching Kobe Bryan play -- but personally? I cannot stand the Lakers.""",1457913600,,658,5.3173076923076925

7564322,3,B0195XEGJS,"There are 3 reasons to see THE DANISH GIRL - 1. Eddie Redmayne's amazing performance 2. Alicia Vikander's emotional performance of love and heartache and 3. The gorgeous setting. Unfortunately, THE DANISH GIRL disappoints as far as story and facts. The film is based on an amazing true story of Einar Wegener's journey as the first person to have sex reassignment surgery. Einar is a woman trapped in a mans body. He desperately wants to physically be female yet he is a lone  pioneer in a time when the word transgender did not exist.

 Einar was blessed in one sense by having his loving and supportive wife Gerda at his side. In fact, it almost seems that Gerda creates Lili. The  Wegeners seem to have an active sex live that fades as Lili takes over Einar.  In the film, Einar acts and dresses like a man until he tries on an article of womans clothing. There is no transition as his masculine side begins to disappear almost immediately. THE DANISH GIRL handles this transition by seeming to give Einar a split personality. He dresses as either Einar or Lili and acts as if they are two separate people.  Even Gerda seems to acknowledge them as two separate people based on how Einar/Lili is dressed. Doctors diagnose Einar with mental illness, but one doctor offers help. He can do a new surgery that will make Lili a functioning woman. There are risks and it won't be easy but Lili will try anything. It's not completely addressed in the film, but the real Lili expected to a woman in every sense and give birth to children.

Both Einar and Gerda are painters. Einars career diminishes as Lili takes over his body but an amazing new life begins. Lili becomes the beautiful and mysterious woman in Gerdas acclaimed paintings. Who is the beautiful woman in Gerdas paintings?  Again, the real story is amazing and it is worth looking at Gerdas paintings of Lili. Again, Gerda seems to be behind Einar's transformation into Lili by having Einar fill in for a female model in a portrait sitting. Is this how THE DANISH GIRL explains Einar's desire to be a woman? It seems to come out of nowhere when no doubt it has been a  lifelong struggle.

Eddie Redmayne is boyish looking bit not feminine so its hard to see him as anything but a man dressed as a woman in THE DANISH GIRL. That's not the proble. It's that he puts on a dress and make-up and simply lowers his voice and supposedly no one realizes he is a man. The real Einar was feminine in features and could easily pass as a woman even before surgery. Its understandable why some people would have preferred a transgender actor in this role. But Eddie Redmayne never disappoints and he sure gives it his best.

Gerda and Lili's relationship is highly romanticized. There is no doubt there was genuine love between them but surely there is more to their marriage than is explored in the film. Was it a marriage of convenience with genuine affection? THE DANISH GIRL could have done better in exploring Einar/Lili and Gerdas emotional journey. THE DANISH GIRL is as much Gerdas story as it is Einar and Lilis. So much potential was missed in this film. They had a remarkable story to tell and left out so many facts.

I knew nothing about Einar and Gerda when I started watching the film. I had an idea of how I thought the story would progress so I think it is wise not to do any research on the real characters until after you have seen the film.  Of course, its hard to condense a complex story into a 2-hour film.  Certainly, I understand some artistic license. When you explore their real-life story, many answers and more questions will come your way. There is so much more to their story than is portrayed on film. If you're like me, youll be disappointed at how much THE DANISH GIRL distorted the facts or left out so many details. In the end, its worth watching just to see Redmayne and Vikander on screen but don't expect historical accuracy.

The DVD only has one feature THE MAKING OF THE DANISH GIRL. They show one picture of Einar. It would have been great to have a feature on the real Einar/Lili and Gerda and to see pictures of them along with pictures of Gerda's paintings of Lili.",1457654400,5,4156,4.522666666666667

7564527,5,B0195XEGJS,"Transgender issues are finally being discussed and studied at length, and while we have no idea how widespread the numbers of people born in the wrong sexual receptacles is, it really makes no difference. This film is about the first transgender reassignment surgery and that aspect works very well as a treatise on etiology and progress of the initial surgical candidate, but the film is more than that; this is a very powerful love story and therein lies its significance. It demonstrates the power and need for finding true, unconditional love. Based on a true story as written by David Ebershoff and adapted for the screen by Lucinda Coxon and direct with tremendous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, the true reason the film works so well is the quality of acting by the two lead characters and their supporting cast.

The setting is Copenhagen in 1926  (introduced by stunningly beautiful landscape photography which will be reflected in the main characters paintings). Danish artist, Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), painted her own artist husband, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), as a lady in her painting. When the painting gained popularity, Einar started to change his appearance into a female appearance and named himself Lili Elbe. With his feminism passion and Gerda's support, Einar - or Elbe - attempted one of the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, a decision that turned into a massive change for their marriage, that Gerda realized her own husband is no longer a man or the person she married before. After a brief romantic dalliance with the handsome Henrik (Ben Whishaw), a childhood friend of Einar, art-dealer Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), shows up and starts a complex love triangle with the couple. We are privy to the medical workup both by the dubious Dr. Hexler (Pip Torrens) and the genteel surgeon Dr Warenekros (Sebastian Koch) and the manner in which the surgeries proceed.

But the most important sense we gain from this long movie is the strength of character of both Gerda and Einear/Lili as played with consummate skill By Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne. The always-reliable Alexandre Desplat supplies the musical score and Danny Cohen the cinematography. Eloquent and memorable. Grady Harp, March 16",1457049600,2,2250,5.158904109589041

7564602,5,B0195XEGJS,"The Danish Girl opens with Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) and wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) as a happy couple in 1920s Copenhagen. He is a successful landscape artist, but Gerda, a portraitist, has not yet achieved success.

Since their sex life is fulfilling, Gerda thinks nothing of it when Einar agrees to dress as a woman and pose for her. These paintings prove to be her commercial breakthrough.

Gradually, however, Gerda begins to realize that Einar is changing from the husband she knew to a woman named Lili, a woman who has been inside him all along.

Based on a true story, the film focuses on the altering relationship between Einar and Gerda when Lili becomes more and more a strain on the marriage. Still, Gerda remains devoted to her husband and never stops loving him. Always understanding, supportive, and caring, she nonetheless suffers within from the loss of the man she married. The film is at its most harrowing when Gerda and Einar go to a series of doctors who attempt to diagnose Einars condition and prescribe torturous and often crank cures.

Mr. Redmayne, who won an Academy Award last year for his role as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, etches a believable, touching portrayal of both Einar and Lili. He is playing more than two roles, since there are several scenes in which he is part Einar, part Lili.

The actors delicate bone structure helps make his transformation into Lili believable. To compensate for his height, he walks with shoulders stooped, and a wig and make-up complete the illusion. To soften his voice, he lowers his volume and speaks in a near whisper. His eyes, in particular, are extremely expressive, combining subtle flirtatiousness with awkward embarrassment that evaporates the more Lili asserts her identity.

Lili may seem a bit remote and overly feminized, but that, Redmayne learned, is a typical stage in the process of gender reassignment. Lilis initial shyness contrasts with Einars easy self-confidence as a public figure and celebrity of the art world.

Ms. Vikander (Ex Machina, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) has a role of equal power. In fact, The Danish Girl could just as easily refer to Gerda. As a confident, talented woman in a time when women were just beginning to assert themselves in politics and business and demand control over their own destiny, Gerda radiates self-assurance and passion. Her devotion to Einar is crystal clear, which makes believable her continued love for him as he transforms permanently into Lili. This is Gerdas tragedy.

Though the film might attract audiences because of its unusual subject matter, what is memorable is the sensitive portrayal of a loving relationship in the throes of adapting to disconcerting developments. Events are consolidated for dramatic effect, but the core of the film is true.  The Danish Girl is based on the 2000 novel of the same name by David Ebershoff and Man Into Woman, a fictionalized biography of Lili based on her own memoirs and published posthumously in 1933.

The case of Einar/Lili is one of the first recorded sexual reassignment surgeries. Directed by Tom Hooper (The Kings Speech), The Danish Girl is likely to be remembered at Oscar time. Redmayne and Vikander should be shoo-ins for Best Actor/Actress nominations, and the picture itself has a good shot as nabbing a Best Picture nomination. The film is rated R.

The Blu-ray release includes a making-of featurette containing cast and crew interviews. It covers writing, directing, casting, costume design and location filming.",1456444800,,3535,5.04631217838765

Eddie Redmayne is wonderful and so believable in the lead role. Alicia Vikander gives an emotional and heartfelt performance as Lily's loving wife - she really deserves the Oscar for this one. The TRUE love story between Lily and her wife is so touching and beautiful - they were two amazing people and I'm glad Hollywood made a movie about them.

7564612,5,B0195XEGJS,"Being a relatively normal guy, I was somewhat hesitant to watch THE DANISH GIRL, which is the true story of a man who underwent a transgender operation during the 1920s.  In fact, had this Tom Hooper-directed film not been nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Eddie Redmayne) and Best Supporting Actress (Alicia Vikander), I would probably have passed on viewing it altogether.

Im glad I didnt.  The story is quite touching, Redmayne and, especially, Vikander are magnificent in their roles and Danny Cohens cinematography is breathtaking.

Lucinda Coxon wrote the screenplay, based on a book by David Ebershoff, which tells the story of a married couple in Copenhagen, both accomplished artists.  The wife (Vikander) is initially shocked when her husband of six years (Redmayne) realizes that he is really a woman in a mans body and decides to surgically correct the error of his birth.  Because of her deep love for him, she eventually comes around, supporting his decision.

Ben Whishaw, Sebastian Koch, Amber Heard and Matthias Schoenaerts co-star.

The Blu-ray disc from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment contains a Making of featurette.

7564613,5,B0195XEGJS,"Some people says bad thing about this film but honestly I don't know why.
I saw this film because of the actor/ actress and the director.
The director's movie <Les Miserables> was great for me but I didn't liked <The King's speech>
I am a huge fan of Eddie Redmayne from <Les Miserables><My Week with Marilyn ><The Other Boleyn Girl>  and  Alicia Vikander from the movie <EX MACHINA>.
The movie is about a man who becomes a Transvestic and finally becomes a transgender and had a surgery to become a woman. He didn't lived as a woman and dies right after he had a woman's genital organ.
This movie concentrates more on Eddie since it's about him who becomes a woman. His wife is a painter who wants her husband to be a female model wearing woman's cloth since -I think- she is not welthy enough to have a proper female model.
Eddie slowly figures out that from his childhood he always wanted to be a woman. He wears woman's clothes and goes out meets with males.
Then finally he had a operationg to be a woman.
Unfortunately at that time the operatation was not well developed and he suffered to death. He didn't experienced a day living as a woman and faded away.
As always even though it was a small roll, Alicia Vikander was so beautiful. I still remember her from the movie <Ex Machina>. I can kidnap her and put her in my closet if I can.
From the beginning I thought that Eddie Redmayne is one of the best actor that is exist. His singing voice is also so pure and even transparent.
But it is his acting which is truely so delicate and even a small move is so nicely thought and performed.
Even the makeup of the woman is not believable that he is not a woman, his acting covers that to make us believe that he is she.
He is that good.
This is a must see movie made in 2015.",1455321600,2,1780,4.263313609467455
7564614,1,B0195XEGJS,"Seeing the actor dress as a woman reminded me a lot of Max Baer in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" dressing to play Jethro's sister Jethrine.  He only looked like a man in drag and not a woman.  The movie seemed kind of long and boring and couldn't hold my interest.  Why did he marry a woman in the first place if he felt he really was a woman?  Oh, I forgot we are in the 21st century now where a person's sex is now meaningless and changeable.  Suggestion for a future movie--now that the 1936 Olympics are being shown with Jesse Owens, how about the 1976 Olympics with Brucelyn and keeping the one-word title call the movie ""JenDer""?",1455321600,15,631,4.358974358974359

7564618,5,B0195XEGJS,"Only one movie theater within 50 miles was playing this movie for only two showings. I was lucky enough to catch the second show and it was a full house. I will be the first to admit that I am very slow to come around on Trans issues but I'm working on it. I'm attempting to educate myself, gain understanding and trying to imagine my life if I couldn't live as who I really was. It's not easy by any means but it is something that I am actively working on. With that said, I was very moved by The Danish Girl, both by Einar/Lilli's pain, anguish and want to be who she really was as well as Gerda and her emotional roller coaster dealing with, essentially, the loss of her husband.

Eddie Redmayne has a fan for life in me. Seriously, is there anything he cannot do? I thought that Alicia Vikander was going to be crushed by Eddie's performance but she floored me. She was the heart and soul of this movie and should have been nominated for Best Actress, not Supporting Actress. After seeing her in Ex Machina I knew she was something special...seeing her in this, I will seek out her films in the future as I do for a handful of others that have captivated me cinematically over the years.

While this film is a departure from the actual true story of Einar/Lili and Gerda, the manner in which the events were told still captivated me. To see what it was like for someone to realize their body was wrong. To have a loved one try to understand, while feeling guilt, anguish, pain and yet still be supportive. The way the doctors treated people who felt different or expressed something that wasn't a vanilla life was all very unsettling. People want to say this is LGBT propaganda. Get over it. Seriously. LGBT people are still being committed in places, like America, for being ""different"". We all have one life to live and everyone wants to find that someone to live it with, why not let people live the life they were born to live and move on. Films like The Danish Girl and Carol are important because it shows how repressed, hypocritical and judgmental society can be and that times, while superficially appear to have changed, really haven't and probably won't.

To illustrate how much The Danish Girl impacted my viewing group of five, my sister-in-law always falls asleep at the movies, action, horror, you name it, she's asleep within ten minutes. Well, she was invested every second, even cried, which is something I've never seen her do at a movie, and then she sat there until the credits ended. Afterwards, she did a ton of internet research on Einar/Lili and Gerda, as did all of us, wanting to know more, the truth about their lives. We talked about it over dinner and on the way home. The power and emotion of Eddie and Alicia's performances are ones that I will never forget and will credit on helping me through my journey of Trans acceptance.",1453248000,58,2862,4.5
7564619,4,B0195XEGJS,"Based on real-life events that occurred in the 1920s (!), we watch a happily married pair of artists grapple with the realities of the husband's latent desire to release his inner woman as he dresses in female clothing. Already nominated for numerous awards (in December, 2015), Academy Award-winning director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") is guided by a screenplay from Lucinda Coxon (""Wild Target"") which in turn was based on David Ebershoff's biographical novel ""The Danish Girl.""

This excellent cast and brilliant production design was convincingly real: Einer is a painter and devoted husband; Gerda, is also a painter who playfully uses her husband as a model for her female portraits. Both of these lead actors deserve all the nominations they get; each one contributes to the quality of the other's game. And the cinematography by Danny Cohen is exquisite, with scenes framed like paintings!

They are:
  * Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything"") is Einer Wegener/Lili Elbe, reluctant to hurt his wife, but compelled to become a woman. Thus with sex reassignment surgery, he becomes a trans-gender pioneer. Medical ""science"" was brutal and clumsy in the 20s and 30s.... You will cringe as they start with radiation to ""cure"" him.
  * Alicia Vikander (""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") is Gerda Wegener, first amused, then confused, finally heartbroken by the transformation of the man she truly loves. She is his staunchest advocate from beginning to end.
  * Ben Whishaw (""Spectre"") Henrik is intrigued by Lily the first time he sees her at a party, so it is no surprise when he surfaces again later in the film.
  * Sebastian Koch (""Bridge of Spies"") Three time's a charm when good doctor Warnekros comes on the scene. Consultations with the first two doctors sent chills down everyone's spine, including our hero/heroine!
  * Matthias Schoenaerts (""Far From the Madding Crowd"") Hans Axgil was there when he and Einer were children, now he's there when Gerda needs him. What more can we ask?
  * Oh! The dog Hvappe is played by Pixie, in her first starring role. ...smile...

As you can see, this highly qualified cast is capable of carrying a complex and heart-wrenching story. You can always tell when a story is based on real life, a storybook ending is often a bit more elusive.

This is rated ""R"" for nudity and the subject matter. Those matters are tastefully handled, but are on screen nonetheless. By the way, much of the dialogue is whispered or murmured, so look for a theater with closed captions! Just remember, this one's for grownups!",1452902400,,2559,4.971830985915493
7564620,5,B0195XEGJS,"One of the best films of 2015 next to The Duke of Burgundy and Carol.
The film was well acted.
The film is not completely true to the original novel but is still worth watching.
You feel the pain and desperation of not being able to be one's self. You feel the character's
struggle.
We have come a long way with the transgendered community, but more is still to be done.
The film is a great example of what another went through during this time period.",1452902400,,452,4.267441860465116
7564621,5,B0195XEGJS,"As the film was showing for the last times in our local theater yesterday, I decided to go see it once more - for the third time. I had urged some of my university students to see it, knowing it would be a stretch in some cases and they'd have to think a good bit afterwards. As I was heading out to go to the cinema, I ran into one of our best students and invited him to go along, which he did. After it was over, we sat in silence for quite a while; I was curious to see what he'd say, so I didn't speak first. When he finally did speak, he said this; ""I hadn't come to see this movie because I thought it was a topic I wouldn't be able to connect with, but with these performances I was so drawn in I was right there with them. It didn't feel topical at all, it felt universal.""

That's pretty astute for a 21-year-old straight guy. I was proud of him.

For me, these are legendary performances. Vikander is flawless. For Redmayne to play, essentially, TWO roles here as compellingly as he does, hard on the heels of his S. Hawking portrayal, is almost frightening. He should plan to take a couple of years off to stay home and play with his kid, so he doesn't burn out; who knows what he'll be capable of?",1452816000,8,1210,4.079831932773109

7564623,4,B0195XEGJS,"Looking at the reviews here and on IMDB I am very surprised with how many people didn't like this film. Granted the subject matter is not for everyone and some may even feel it is pushing a specific agenda. Others may feel some of the characters were not developed enough - I would tend to agree here.

I really thought Alicia Vikander's character, Gerda, could have been explored more. Besides a few tears here and there she was unnaturally stoic as her husband went through this process. I wanted to know what made her tick; however, her performance was solid and noteworthy.

Besides not really looking like a woman at all, I thought Eddie Redmayne's performance was spectacular. Him practicing the nuances of femininity was believable.

Watching this movie was like looking at postcards, the cinematography was outstanding. I just really enjoyed the movie.

If you can stomach the subject matter, don't expect it to walk the same path as the book, and creatively think of this man passing as a woman then you will not have any issues with this film. I say kudos the the cast and crew.",1452384000,5,1088,4.7105263157894735

Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander make you feel the deep love and commitment that the pair share and that makes their situation so very heartbreaking.  Still, though, Redmanyne makes Lily's plight sympathetic so that you understand and even root for her to become the woman that she truly is.  It's hard to imagine that it is within the last century that transgender surgery came into being and Lily Elbe was the first patient to undergo the life changing procedure.  Watching the struggle that this couple go through and the choices that they make is so emotionally affecting.  You feel the pain and longing that Einer experiences as he tries to come to terms with his true identity and finally allows Lily to emerge.  I don't see how anyone could watch this and not be moved and inspired.  Please do yourself a favor and watch The Danish Girl.",1452384000,2,928,4.656441717791411
