8121234,2,B000FDE5S0,"This review is specifically for this Triad Edition of G.W. Pabst's Don Quixote, not of the film itself.

I am returning this DVD to Amazon. There is nothing ""enhanced"" about it. The picture quality is worse than the VHS tape I want to replace, overly bright and washed out. The lengthy scrolling introductory titles are unreadable.

The Amazon listing specifies a runtime of 73 minutes, but the actual time is only 55 minutes. This disc contains only the English language version of the film, whereas the VAI tape and DVD both contain both the English and French versions. They are NOT identical, some scenes are very different. Also, Chaliapin's English is nearly unintelligible. His French is quite good, and the VAI version has subtitles. The four songs Jacques Ibert wrote for the film are also badly translated into English.

Pabst's films (there was also a German version which I've never seen) are masterpieces. They should be seen by anyone interested in the great Russian basso Fyodor Chaliapin, and anyone interested in the history of acting, as it is said that Stanislavsky devised his Method from watching Chaliapin. BUT wait for a better edition or buy the VAI edition.",1269648000,8,1182,4.959595959595959
8121235,5,B000FDE5S0,"G.W.Pabst's film version of ""Don Quixote"", originally filmed in three languages, but with the same leading actor, may not please all lovers of the great Cervantes novel, but it makes a fascinating document for music lovers and opera buffs. Although not based at all on the Jules Massenet opera in which he sang the title role, this is the only chance to see and hear the great Russian basso Fyodor Chaliapin in one of his greatest roles.

Chaliapin revolutionized the art of opera acting, and if he had wanted to, could have been an equally effective non-singing actor, although his English is heavily accented and he tends to declaim rather than just speak. His singing voice in this film is probably not what it once was, but he is so charismatic that he holds the audience riveted.(You may squirm through some of the songs, though - this isn't Massenet's opera, or ""Man of La Mancha"", for that matter.)

The supporting cast is quite good in both English and French versions (I haven't seen the German one), and Chaliapin himself speaks and sings better French than English. The photography is beautiful, although this really isn't Spain,and the windmill sequence is a flabbergasting accomplishment for 1933. You may like a little more emotional involvement in your movies, though.",1255564800,5,1283,4.935185185185185
8121236,5,B000FDE5S0,"There are few experiences in the movies where one can go back in time a century...as it truly was.  Chaliapin was Russia's greatest opera singer who thrilled the Imperial Czars with his acting and voice.  The ONLY full length film of his performance is this one of Don Quixote.  We might have preferred one of his Russian operas, but Chaliapin is really very dynamic in this role - one he created in 1910.  Don't miss it.",1182470400,11,421,4.5
8121237,1,B000FDE5S0,"If the above information is accurate, that means this DVD is only a transfer of the VHS (which I sent back as soon as I received it 3 years ago) where about 2 x 15 minutes are missing : the runtime for these movies (english & french versions should be around 150 min., and not 120 min. as shown in 'product information'.

Of course my rating doesn't apply to the movie, which is the ONLY ONE where one can listen to Feodor Chaliapin Sr.'s voice. When the nerds pretending to enforce copyrights are going to understand that butchering movies is the worst offence? Or maybe they only want to enforce crooks' rights, and believe customers have only the right to be cheated!!!!!",1179878400,17,674,4.524590163934426
