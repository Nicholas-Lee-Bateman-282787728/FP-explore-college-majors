There's, of course, the message about slavery - its ubiquitous practice even beyond earth - and the underlying passion of people to be free.  Then there are the messages  about drugs, about inter-racial marriage and relationships, about love with  the proper stranger, about life as a 'has been' singing star, and on and  on.  You'll also love the music, the acting, and, of course, Little Earl!  In my list of top ten of all time!  Thanks John, Joe and everyone else  involved in this movie.",954547200,6,547,4.625

1198029,4,B000009RZN,"Oh, great; you're black, extraterrestrial, and newly stranded in New York City after crashing your spaceship in the waters just off Ellis Island Immigration Center. Now what?

Visionary indie filmmaker/director/writer John Sayles could have played it straight, keying on the potential horrors of it, dangerous drug dealers and street gangs and lack of shelter and food, surly suspicious white cops etc. etc. Or gone the opposite way and shot for broad laughs, based on the ultimate outsider's clumsiness borne of total unfamiliarity with the local scene. This being Harlem, mostly.

But what Sayles does instead is strike a middle ground, giving ET Brother/Joe Morton a very interesting and competitive profile and turning him loose. No, Bro can't talk, much less speak English. But he's sharp enough to learn to drive the car he's just stolen in one go, he's got paranormal abilities, and he can do astounding things with assorted parts of his body. For sure he'll also need to do something  astounding to elude the two muscular white bounty hunters from home bent on bringing him back.

Sayles did lose me entirely more than once with developments in the second half of the movie; I felt as disoriented as an ET myself during a couple of scenes. Those bounty hunters (the taller one is Sayles himself) are maybe shading a little too far toward the comical to be dramatic. And the big chase scene, accompanied by pop music, reminded me of early MTV videos. But then he does display a wonderful eye for life's small details, lessons learned long ago that we all take for granted. A warm-hearted, good show for you, regardless if you're black, white, ET or a combination.",1433030400,,1670,4.911347517730497
1198030,5,B000009RZN,"This has remained on my Top 25 list of sci-fi films since first seeing it in the 1980s. If you haven't yet, please do yourself a favor and give it a try.

1198044,1,B000009RZN,"Just watched this, and normally I wouldn't come on here and give a review for just any random movie, but I was blown away by the overwhelmingly glowing reviews both here and on Rotten Tomatoes.  I must have missed something.  I just watched a movie about a mute, black alien with three toes, who crashes on Earth and ends up in Harlem where he almost immediately degenerates into the worst possible racial stereotype of an African American I have ever seen.  He begins stealing money, stealing cars,sleeping around, doing drugs and running from the cops (which he instinctively dislikes) and even stops at one point for no apparent reason to play basketball.  He is chased by two white guys, who are apparently alien cops or immigration or possibly chasing him as an escaped slave, its not really ever spelled out.  The protagonist is such a danger to himself and a menace to society that you find yourself rooting for the two inept alien cops to catch him and take him somewhere where he can get help.

When he comes across a kid who died of a drug overdose, I thought for sure he was going to use his alien healing powers to bring him back to life.  Nope.  Instead, he takes the kid's drugs, gets high and runs off with a rastafarian.

The film's commentary seems to be that if you take away any knowledge of society, and make a clean slate of a black man's mind, he will instinctively fear police, steal stuff, and do crack.  I cannot imagine anything more offensive.  If this had been made by an African American writer or director, I might give it a pass (probably not), but it was written and directed by a white guy, so what the heck is going on?

The only part of these reviews that I agree with is that Joe Morton's performance is good.  He does a great job of playing the part of the alien fugitive, especially considering that he cannot speak.  Still, his performance cannot make up for the bad story.

(Super Spoiler Alert)

The film ends with a completely nonsensical climax which defies explanation.  The two butt kicking (if awkward) alien cops finally catch up with the main character, but despite previously being able to effortlessly defeat multiple attackers, they decide to self destruct when faced with the prospect of fighting the alien fugitive's unarmed friends.  Are these friends aliens too?  Why did the alien cops self destruct?  Why did his friends put him on a subway train?  Where is he going?  Not to the Oscars, that's for sure.",1380240000,2,2461,4.609195402298851

 The film itself is a wonderful fable of an E.T. who is trying to find a safe haven, after his ship has crash landed in of all places N.Y. City.

1198063,4,B000009RZN,"This movie has been a cult favorite of mine for many years after first seeing it on late night TV.

The brother (Joe Morton) from another planet arrives in 1980s NYC (the city is almost an additional character) and we immediately see that he is possessed of extra-human abilities.

Although he is mute, he is welcomed by the residents of the Harlem neighborhood he wanders into.

The brother doesn't understand our culture which gives John Sayles an opportunity to expound on racism, ethnic stereotypes and our society's ingrained biases.

The casual treatment of bias in our culture  confuses the brother, which allows for a frank appraisal of the ""racial"" bias in that era (I was there and it's spot-on) that continues to this day.  Fisher Stevens' ""last trick"" was so poignant, especially as I saw that ""trick"" just about every day.

We find out that the brother has escaped from a society that discriminates against people based on a ridiculous premise (""Three-toe"") which really points up the inherent stupidity of the biases based on inherent characteristics (skin pigmentation, sexual orientation, etc.) in our own society.

No more spoilers, but the acting is reasonably good and the very serious subject matter is embedded in a number of extremely amusing vignettes.  Once again, the backdrop of 80s NYC is really fabulous.

There isn't a lot of subtlety but it's fun and somewhat thought provoking.  Did I mention that NYC provides a wonderful backdrop for this film?",1353110400,3,1477,5.012295081967213

1198078,4,B000009RZN,"Joe Morton doesn't say a word, but his performance as a wayward alien is quirky and engaging, in The Brother From Another Planet (1984), a sci-fi/comedy written and directed by John Sayles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-with-Guns/dp/B0000AMU29/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men with Guns</a>), that is set in Harlem.  Except for his feet, Morton's character can pass for a human, and although he can understand English, he is not able to speak.  The extraterrestrial doesn't really have a name other than ""brother"", yet manages to get by, mainly due to the kindness of the people that he meets, most of whom are African American.  People just seem to respond to the Brother's charm and gentle ways.

On the run from a pair of ""men in black"" types who want to recapture him, the Brother crash lands on Earth, and emerges from the water in New York City.  He eventually ends up in a bar in Harlem, and with help from a social worker, is taken as a boarder with a widow and her son.

The Brother has strange powers, and is able to heal wounds and repair machines with just his touch, and he uses this talent to earn some coin repairing video games.  Many appreciate the Brother's gentle ways, as even without being able to speak, he finds love with a night club singer.  As the Brother attempts to fit in, the men In black (David Strathairn and John Sayles) are on his trail, flashing the Brother's photo and questioning those in the neighborhood.  When they do eventually locate him, the Brother finds that he is not alone, as his many friends rally to his side.

While mostly a low-key affair, the action highlight is definitely a cool extended fight scene in a bar.  Special effects do occasionally come into play, such as when the Brother removes an eye for use as surveillance device.  Joe Morton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a>) gives an animated and winning performance in a challenging role, where he has to rely on his expressions and body language, to try and communicate his feelings.  Though we don't really know what the Brother is all about, like those in the movie, we feel that he is a good guy who means no harm.  Mostly quirky and fun, with a little action at the end, Brother From Another Planet is a sensitive little sci-fi flick that may bring a smile to your face.",1327536000,3,2462,5.076923076923077

1198098,5,B000009RZN,"This DVD, released in 2003, is not the one complained about in other reviews.  It is made from a copy that was lovingly restored by the UCLA film school archive, and the sound and picture are clear throughout.  You can even freeze-frame and zoom in to see some little background surprises that the director points out in his commentary.  The commentary, by director John Sayles, is low-key, enlightening, and actually focused on the film, cast, and plot. Joe Morton is actually the star of this film, though he is not even mentioned in the above cast list.
I have loved this movie since I first saw it back in high school.  It is a ""sci-fi"" film in that it deals with aliens and there is action and tension, but that is the least of what this film is.  It is funny, exciting, and leaves me feeling better about humanity in a way that is not sticky-sweet.  It reveals aspects of African-American culture that are rarely seen in any movie, old or new - the supportive sense of community that can give someone who is lost a soft place to land.  Kindness offered out of the empathy of shared hardship and disenfranchisement.  Three-Toe is from another planet, an alien, but when he wanders into Harlem, he is simply and immediately ""brother"", and the first thing he is asked is ""can I help you, brother?""  Every character we meet through his alien eyes is a delight.  People in this film are good to each other in ordinary and believable ways, and it surprised me to realize how little of that I see in current movies, and how nice it felt to watch.

That's the case here, a unique story of an alien who crashes near Harlem, a famous black neighborhood in New York City. The alien is a black man, so he fits in despite not being able to speak! He's just looked upon as another ""brother,"" as the title indicates.

Two aliens come after him - white guys, naturally. In the Liberal world of films, white people are usually bad, especially if  John Sayles writes and/or directs. But he wrote a fun film here, I have to give him that.

Even though some of the scenes make absolutely no sense, it's an entertaining movie start-to-finish. Joe Morton plays the sympathetic alien with three toes and strange nails, and no voice. You have to root for him because he's portrayed as such an innocent, harmless creature.

The best part of the film is the humor, some subtle, some not-so-subtle. The guys in the neighborhood bar where the ""brother"" hangs out brought the biggest laughs.

I find this a lot of fun to watch every three or four years. I'm glad it's finally out with the correct aspect ratio and much better transfer.",1233187200,,1147,4.543689320388349

1198101,5,B000009RZN,"This is a great off-beat sci fi cult classic directed by the one and only John Sayles!!! This 2003 release from MGM is SO MUCH better than the 2001 release by UAV!!! The print is so much cleaner and is in anamorphic widescreen for the first time,The UAV master used for the DVD was most likely a VHS dub that was Pan and Scan,this one seems to be a proper film transfer!!! And this one contains some extras as well like an audio commentary with Sayles,interview w/Sayles,etc!!! A solid release from MGM!!!",1221091200,,505,4.5
1198102,5,B000009RZN,This movie is one of my all time favorites.  Have seen it a number of times and thought I would buy it.  It is funny and profound.  Definitely shows a subculture and of course I love his feet.  Came out before the Hobbits(at least the film).  Plan to show it to my younger friends who never got a chance to see it or appreciate it.  I never saw graffiti in the same way after seeing this movie. It is like a parable and an urban fairy tale.  Five stars!,1210032000,3,453,4.022471910112359
1198103,5,B000009RZN,I must say that this movie is one of my all time classics.  It is a social commentary on race relations.  It is a science fiction movie.  It is a comedy.  I loved the fact that the Brother sleeps with Dee Dee Bridgewater without ever saying a word.  Let that be a lesson to guys who stumble over their tounges trying to come up with a come on line.  Just be real and sincere and you may be surprised.  Joe Morton is great.  His acting was was not over the top.  It was inspired on the part of John Sayles to have the Brother land in New York.  This could have been a twilight zone episode.  It had all the ingredients.  A man who could not speak but had special powers living among humans.  Get the movie you will enjoy it.,1177200000,3,723,4.042553191489362
1198104,5,B000009RZN,"If you appreciate fine acting, in particular, the artistry of silent acting, you will want to watch Joe Morton over and over again in this low-budget classic from John Sayles. Part Chaplin, part Keaton, even part Harpo, Morton is simply magnificent. His gestures and movements, his body language and facial expressions encompass a huge physical vocabulary from frightened innocence to gleeful joy, from tired resignation to bold determinism. In a heroic dash up and down Harlem, Morton's character pulls the audience along on a sometimes comic, sometimes gritty extraterrestrial flight from intergalactic cops.

The Brother from Another Planet, Sayles's funky sci-fi, grand metaphor of sanctuary and immigration, immortalizes Morton as a great silent star. Probably best known for his supporting role in Terminator 2 as the self-sacrificing scientist, he ironically enough got his start in the 1968 Broadway production of Hair and later earned a Tony Best Actor nomination for his performance in a musical version of A Raisin in the Sun. BTW, the first music you hear in Brother is a clip of rap that Morton's character ""hears"" from the graffiti-covered walls on a deserted back street. (Yes, he is able to pick up ""lost"" voices from walls and chairs and public spaces.) Watch the credits at the end and you will discover that the rapper is Morton himself!

Of course there is more to Brother than Joe Morton's sterling performance. Endless metaphors of racial inequality, issues of otherness, bureaucracy, drug trafficking, alienation, slavery, and the funny sadness of people constantly wrapped up in themselves resound throughout the film. Not as rough as a Sun Ra flick, but certainly as genuine and homey and wise, Brother endures time and looks just as current as when it was made in 1984.",1153440000,6,1795,5.164948453608248
1198105,5,B000009RZN,"If you enjoy quirky and dark humor, this is a delightful and thoughtful film.  My wife and I are very happy to own this film.",1152316800,2,125,4.0
1198106,4,B000009RZN,"The story of a man on the lam, intergalactically, is compelling, primarily because of Joe Morton who says not a word in the entire movie.  John Sayles' direction is unobtrusive but effective.  One of my favorite lighter moments is the morning after a romantic night when the woman tells Brother that he's a terrific lover but he has to do something with those toenails (the only outwardly difference of Brother is his three toed feet with claws).  [...]  ""Brother"" deserves more.",1126310400,4,479,4.8765432098765435
1198117,5,B000009RZN,"This is a very well done story whose low budget does NOT get in the way (in fact, it adds to the charm). The story about a Black extraterrestrial who winds up in Harlem and then...well, you'll find out. For non-sci-fi fans and those used to the typical action films or crude ghetto comedies featuring black casts, this film may take some getting used to, as it is sparse on dialogue. After viewing it once, I recommend watching it again and with John Sayles' excellent commentary.

Overall, once you get it, it's great. It speaks to anyone who has ever felt like a ""fish out of water"" and longed to be understood and become a part of a community (in this case, Harlem, one of the world's most famous communities, becomes a metaphor). Of course there is more to the film's message that that, but see the film, find out, and enjoy.",1111536000,6,829,4.453947368421052
1198118,5,B000009RZN,"Imagine the result if someone were wise enough to adapt one
of the works of SF grandmaster Octavia E. Butler. Better yet,
imagine if there had been a grand convergence of Butler's
speculations on world development and African American
perspective, with the poetry, folklore and commentary of
Langston Hughes.
With THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET, filmmaker John
Sayles, cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson, and the
character acting master Joe Morton as the silent lead
all achieve this major feat of storytelling excellence.
Rarely have motion pictures captured the heart of the
Black Diaspora, let alone delve to the narrative core
of actual Science Fiction as deeply as this film does
so magnificently.
Its probing style and cutting edge satire hits with
stone irony; its humor dry to the bone, yet inviting
to the touch, and delightfully devastating to the
unprepared. 20 years later, THE BROTHER still resonates
with sharp genius. Its winding tale and participants
bring home a discerning warmth which delivers the wit
and pathos of Black perspective with breathtaking
fullness.
From the hands of a White man, THE BROTHER is a
marked study of how to do one's homework well, and
more.  Certainly, Sayles' pioneering independent
filmwork here proved far more astute in addressing
-and depicting-  the Black aesthetic than the lackwit
Tommery, thug-happy Jim Crow jumping, and Stephen
Fechit gesturings far too in vogue  -for far too
long-  as ""Black Entertainment"".

Of course, it's how the film utilizes African
American ambiance to deliver one of the great
works of Science Fiction film which has
bewildered both critics and moviegoers alike
for 20 years. Consider how few ""big"" films are
based solidly in Black culture, let alone SF
films which find us discomfortingly absent,
too often, to this day, and you begin to see
the general confusion about a serious SF film
which is a serious film about an African
American community as well.
Further, since most people regard the SF film
field as technological playgrounds for ""comicky
popcorn epics"" (let alone the snob-ridden dribble
of ""sci-fi""), films which can utilize technology
to help properly tell a great cinematic story has
traditionally bewildered American audiences.
BLADE RUNNER taking decades to be recognized
as an epic, along with the misconceptions
regarding more recent epics such as Spielberg's
MINORITY REPORT and the recent Simon Wells/John
Logan take on THE TIME MACHINE, bear this
out.
For every thematic, dramatic and technical
triumph achieved by the likes of THE LORD OF
THE RINGS, major befuddlement at such daring
work from a principally Speculative source
(witness the tailing-off of interest towards
THE MATRIX trilogy, or the utter disdain
towards Lucas' current STAR WARS films)
all demonstrates just how far audience
attention & audience appreciation has
yet to go.

THE BROTHER eschews super-technology altogether,
throwing FX-seekers way off-line! Sayles and
friends opt for minimal opticals and some
old-fashioned staging to make the point
of THE BROTHER's alienation, as much a
product of the enslavement he's rejecting
as it is a reaction to the literal new
world to which he's come.
Thrown into the hectic thoroughfare of Harlem,
brought face-to-face with the pratfalls of
everything from Social Services to drink
minimums at night clubs, THE BROTHER has
a very short time to learn a whole lot about
the human race, and how he means to fit into
it.
All manner of folk, from a gregarious
White single mother to as rich a collection
of barhoppers as you will find anywhere,
imbue the hapless extraterrestrial with an
array of pessimisms, joys, and reflections,
giving him ample space to contemplate upon
what it is to be human.
Even the proverbial gag of White rubes lost
in Harlem bears much thought to treasure,
poking wry wit at the ongoing perplexities
of ""Race"".

While the film is a cornucopia of great Black
talent seen in all manner of entertainment over
the past 20 years, it's the lead performer's
standout portrayal which makes this film so
particularly special. A mute wanderer with a
healing touch for man, woman, child and
machine poses a telling metaphor all his own,
one which Joe Morton executes with a skill
of pantomime worthy of Chaplin himself.
Silent, Morton's performance here communicates
volumes of emotional impact, and great dramatic
strength. From confusion over hard drugs and
death, to the pangs of romance, on to the
desperation of his chase for Freedom, Morton
delivers a bravura presentation which will bring
you enthusiastically to your feet by film's
end.
A key longtime player in Sayles' repertory,
and a supporting player frequently seen in
a variety of roles for both film and
television, it's astonishing that this
acting marvel has not been casted in more
lead roles. Underrated, Morton is easily
among this generation's most accomplished
dramatic masters.
Undaunted, Morton carries the vision on,
even as THE BROTHER stands as his signature
showcase.

Best of all, THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET
demonstrates how the littlest things bear
the greatest significance. From the quick
social wisdom of a subway ride, to turning
a bureaucracy inside out, the film is a
wonderful excursion into the nature of
Struggle, getting by, and learning to do
more than just survive.
Even the value of keeping an eye on things
takes on a whole new meaning for inner
city dwellers and upwardly mobile bank
executives alike.

When all is said and done, it comes to this:

Be thoughtful.
Be entertained.

Give THE BROTHER some.",1094169600,25,5537,5.141111111111111
1198119,5,B000009RZN,"This is one of my favorite films of all time.  Like many really good Sci Fi tales, it is ultimately a very human story.  I love so many of the scenes - the character interactions in the bar scenes are great.  And Joe Morton is terrific.
They didn't have much budget for this and there are obvious clumsy mistakes in the movie.  Some of the mistakes are even pointed out in the director's comments, but it just adds to the enjoyment.  (But my DVD copy is just fine. I don't understand the quality complaints in other reviews here.)
For all the rough spots, I don't miss the million dollar effects one bit.  Effects might even push the story aside too much.  This DVD will always have an honored place on my shelf and I will enjoy this many more times.  (And I could never say the same for Matrix Revolutions, for example.)",1085356800,7,821,4.355263157894737
1198120,5,B000009RZN,"Having bought the UAV release of this movie and being disappointed in the playback, I was thrilled to see a major label like MGM has picked up this gem of a movie and released it rrecently on DVD.  The picture is crystal clear, and the sound is great.  This is how this movie should have been released on DVD in the first place.  There are no noise lines or pixeling in the MGM version.  There is just vibrant colour and clarity.  Parts of the movie show graininess, but that is not the fault of the DVD, it's just the film used, plus this movie is from 1984, so there wasn't digital filming at that time.  I am very happy to finally get this movie that has been properly transferred onto DVD.  This disc features a running audio commentary from John Sayles, plus an interview with him too.  If you were not happy with the UAV version of this movie, I strongly recommend picking up the MGM release, because the movie looks how it should look on DVD and that's great!",1064361600,48,966,4.3277777777777775
1198121,5,B000009RZN,"NOTE: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW IS FOR THE UNITED AMERICAN VIDEO DVD RELEASE, NOT THE MGM DVD VERSION RELEASED A YEAR AFTER THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN - I saw this classic movie back in the mid '80s, and I must say that it is memorable.  What really makes this movie is the performance of Joe Morton and the supporting cast.  Joe doesn't say a word of dialogue throughout the movie, but his facial expressions and body language prove that he has an undisputed talent for acting.  He plays an intergalactic slave running away from bounty hunters.  Crash landing in New York City, he gets to experience what the world has to offer.  The comedy in this movie is subtle, but very witty which adds to the charm of this movie.  I was hesitant to buy this movie on DVD because of the reviews & the price.  On the back of the keep case, there is a disclaimer stating that there are picture imperfections due to the master used.  I've never seen this on a DVD before!  The good things about the DVD is that it's very clear & in focus.  The colour looks normal (people are not flaming pink or morbid grey looking) & the disc plays continuous & doesn't freeze after each scene.  The bad things are:  The master used is not even acceptable for broadcast standards.  There are a lot of artifacts throughout the movie (periodic horizontal noise lines & pixelling around the 45minute mark)  It looks like a worn out BETA SP master was used.  This is where the price comes in, for a DVD it's really low priced, but it shows that you get what you pay for.  It's unfortunate, because this movie deserves the respect of being digitally remastered and reissued on a properly produced DVD.",1032825600,61,1660,4.483333333333333

He is pursued by two really hokey aliens. Morton's grin is infectious. There's a wonderful morning-after scene, when his night's companion tells him he needs to get his toenails cut.
This is a camp classic for sci fi & fantasy buffs. Not in the same league as The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but certainly on the next level.

1198124,5,B000009RZN,"This is a must see for any one who is knowledgeable about the history of African Americans.  Morton stars as an alien, who is escaping from a distant planet where he was enslaved.  This movie is Joe Morton's best work ever, although his character is mute...through his talent as an actor, he speaks volumes.
Although comedic in nature, the movie has some serious undertones and displays a lot of symbolism and historic references throughout.  For example, Morton's space ship initially lands in the immigrant entry point of Ellis Island, however, as a Black man, he finds his way to Harlem where he can 'blend in' safely and hide from the peculiar, looking and acting, white slave catchers.
This movie is one of the best movies ever made that can be enjoyed by anyone at any age.  As a matter of fact, I think it would be a great family discussion movie with the ""drug problem"" and ""man's inhumanity to man"" co-plots.  Rent it!  Buy it!

Magnificent!  We have an opportunity to comprehend the insanities that we have created in our society.
