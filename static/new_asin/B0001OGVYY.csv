Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry arrive to help, but Faust has returned to his evil ways. He plans on starting another war. The Saber Dolls are torn between helping their master and doing what they know is right.

The story in this DVD gets really good. There is action, suspense, and plenty of drama. My complaint with this 2nd season remains the same. The character designs, voice acting, and detail in this series have been shot to hell. All the characters are ugly and the voice actors suck. If you average the 5 star story and the 1 star production quality, you get 3 stars. I love the Saber Marionette J story and I hate to give it 3 stars, but season 2 doesn't deserve it.",1355961600,,839,4.556291390728477
8015541,4,B0001OGVYY,"Saber Marionette J to X Program Three takes the story back to where it should be: away from the filler episodes of the previous volumes and into a cohesive story. Elements displayed ing the series opening become clearer, and a new tale of intrigure begins. The threat to Terra II's security is revealed, and SMJ veterans can expect to see homages to previous events and cameos by some minor, older, characters. The tone of the series does a 180, turning away from the earlier happy/bouncy feel with a series of genuinely surprising plot twists and some shocking violence. This volume charts the course for episodes to come. This volume redeems SMJtoX from some of its blander early moments, and restores one's faith in the series. Reccomended to any fan of the original. The adventure continues!",1031961600,5,795,4.896296296296296
