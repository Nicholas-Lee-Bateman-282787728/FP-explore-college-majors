8583975,5,B00COGQUOI,"As has been known for decades, going back to the immediate start of the Cold War in the wake of the end of World War II, nothing ever grows in dark, secret places other than perhaps mushrooms.  And yet our own United States government, which three hundred twenty million of us place our trust in, is a rats nest of secrecy beyond anything that we could ever imagine in an old-school Communist state like Stalinist Russia or the Red China of Mao Tse-Tung.  This has been especially true since September 11, 2001, where our national security state has not only kept as much highly sensitive information from the public as it possibly can, but has also severely punished anybody who blows the whistle on incompetence and criminal venality inside the national security state, and what President Eisenhower most famously referred to as the Military/Industrial Complex.  This is the subject of director Robert Greenwalds 2013 documentary WAR ON WHISTLEBLOWERS.

As shown in this 67 minute-long film, blowing the whistle on government dissembling has troubling consequences for the people who do it, whether they are inside the government itself, or inside the news media, which is supposed to be that mythical Fourth Estate, keeping the government honest.  The most famous whistleblower in U.S. history, at least up until Edward Snowden, was Daniel Ellsberg, the former Pentagon employee who, in 1971, leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times and the Washington Post, and so inflamed the Nixon Administration that, in the words of Henry Kissinger, he became the most dangerous man in the world.  Both Ellsberg and journalist Seymour Hersh, the man who broke the horrible 1968 My Lai massacre in Vietnam to the world at large in late 1969, are interviewed by Greenwald here.  But the main focus of WAR ON WHISTLEBLOWERS is on four specific whistleblowers who uncovered specific acts of malfeasance: Franz Gayl; Thomas Drake; Michael DeKort; and Thomas Tamm.  Each of them uncovered things that the public would otherwise never have known about, and in each case they personally suffered for their efforts.

Gayl, bought to the attention of those in high places in the Pentagon about the vulnerability of Humvees to IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) in Iraq, which led to new and far better armored MRAP vehicles being developed and deployed.  Gayl, however, suffered a great deal for his trouble.

Drake uncovered the fact that the NSAs claims of not spying on Americans without a warrant were, to put it quite mildly, not exactly true.  Not surprisingly, the FBI and the national security apparatus gave him an enormous amount of grief.

DeKort uncovered information about the Coast Guards fleet of ships and boats having radios that were susceptible to catastrophic water damage and hulls that were vulnerable to fatal damage.  He bought what he knew first to YouTube and then to 60 Minutes, and managed to survive the scrutiny.

Tamm worked in the Justice Department for victims of the 9/11 attacks and developed protocols of probable cause to conduct wiretaps against suspected terrorist agents, only to find out that his superiors were going well beyond what was allowed under due process.

As WAR ON WHISTLEBLOWERS shows, the idea that such activity is tantamount to treason is just a ploy by the national security state to cover up activities that at the very least are acts of incompetence, and at their most extreme can create blowback years later.  These people are oftentimes necessary for our own personal protection specifically, and the protection of our way of life and our freedoms in general.  Greenwald admonishes us to never forget their intentions, and to question government authority without exception.",1461974400,,3727,5.081967213114754

8583978,3,B00COGQUOI,"This documentary is a shame. It deals with an important matter and gives some good information but is shows lousy execution.

Here's the scoop. Whistleblowers should be viewed as heroes bringing to light the wrongdoings of their superiors, companies, agencies etc. But, as of late, much has been done to vilify them. This documentary sets out to expose that vilification.

The format here is to take the cases of a few whistleblowers and what it was that they were attempting to bring to light. Then it exposes the consequences they suffered as a result and, in some cases, their redemption. The cases here are pretty good though not quite the level of, say, Edward Snowden. The viewer hears their stories and what they are made to endure. The legal troubles, FBI raids, huge legal bills and the like. The reporters that lent their ears and published the cases also chime in and talk on how they are under increasing pressure to stay away from these types of stories. It also shows how bills have been passes in Congress to, in some cases, protect whistleblowers, but in others to come down hard on them.

As I mentioned, much of the information here is good. The problem lies in the directing. It vacillated from cheesy to heavy handed and sometimes manage to accomplish both simultaneously.

That being said this still should be seen. I think the average American realizes how we're being sold down the river by big business and an ever-increasing secretive government. This just puts more bullets in that gun.",1404950400,,1512,4.803846153846154
8583979,5,B00COGQUOI,"It wasn't a cinamatic masterpiece, but it WAS a story worth telling.  I worked for DoD and it was every bit as corrupt as the recent media releases and movies portray.  When I read about how the victim in sexual assault cases 'had it coming' or wasn't ""credible"" (think Air Force Academy rapes, Anita Hill, or the latest General Sinclair case) I always laugh wryly.  The government goes WAY out of its way to discredit the victim, and, as Monty Python would say, ""plummage (or in this case facts).........don't enter into it"".  The irony is federal employees are compelled to uphold the constitution and defend their country against ALL enemies, foreign and domestic.  But when those employees do so, all of a sudden you are falsely chacterized as a 'stripper' or a 'drug user' or god knows how many other unseemly things.  (Think the female scientist in The Bourne Legacy).  It's standard operating procedure.  I've seen firsthand what Dept of Defense does to their own employees and citizens .......it makes me think their characterization of foreign leaders, axes of evil, and terrorist groups is not to be believed.  ""Ummm.....what weapons of mass destruction?""",1400198400,4,1165,4.994818652849741
8583980,5,B00COGQUOI,"Great documentary, made me really sick to know how stupid US. Military industries lobbyists don't really care for anything but making money. Unbelievable.",1391040000,8,154,5.739130434782608
8583981,5,B00COGQUOI,"Americans are not as free as they think they are, they live in a delusion of freedom. It maybe that the Western world we live is not as free as we all believe, sadly it may be so. I really do not know but i suspect this may be the case. After the death of President Roosevelt every President since appears to have had their own agenda and that appears it is to wage war where ever they can find a conflict. This country can seem to not be able to exist without a conflict. Anyone who has paid attention and read or watched stories such as ""THE PAT TILLMAN STORY"" OR ""THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA & the VIETNAM CLASSIFIED PAPERS"". Cover up after cover up. It seems if we are to believe these many programs which by the way are available we should revise our opinions and take the care to absorb the HORROR. I also suspect the truth will one day be revealed about the real ASSASSINATION of President Kennedy, not in my time!!? This is not news it is just not achnowledged by the US GOVT. There are books and dvds on the subject, it is there if citizens are aware, pay attention and source them. The majority of the populace are not interested or pay any attention as to the running of our Western countries or who are the real people we entrust our country, our lives and the future lives of our children and grandchildren, so on and so forth. Is it collective amnesia? It is not rocket Science, is it? They have made a national treasure of President Kennedy. Why was he eliminated?  Why have so many people swallowed the story that one man with a dodgey rifle took Kennedy's life!!!! Why did the Secret Service allow an ooen car with very little protection? I believe the other story about a French Hitman. Did President Kennedy want to withdraw from Vietnam? What has driven Wikieleaks to reveal and show the world how vulnerable US security really is? If some young skilled hackers manage to infiltrate the Pentagon then whatother weaknessess have they revealed to their enemies ? I have a dvd which basically outlines how dependent the US is on the Electricity grid system & how it would stop their nation dead without it. I could not believe what i was watching and why would they expose themselves like that? I was shocked when i saw this on TV first and then sourced the Dvd from AMAZON. Now to our so called mutual enemies if they mobilise. I would say PLEASE USA do lead the rest of the free world into WW3 by entering Syria. Allow the Middle East to resolve their own issues and internal battles. Why must we be involved. 9/11 was also a shock as i watched in disbelief those beautiful towers come smashing down taking the lives of over 3,000 people ???? All the clues were there, the FBI and CIA seemingly incompetent and not achnowledging the information which led to this tragedy in their own homeland. I feel saddened disappointed & ashamed by all i see and although i am glad to be able to watch these dvds and read my books freely available for anyone to see & read it is such a pity the direction and lengths humans will resort to in the name of greed. I once admired America and still as a Westerner must support our Western cousins. We can not blame the general population of the USA but it is such a shame to find what is and may be the truth and how we will we be judged for posterity. This is the history which will be read if there will be a future. WW3 will be short and i think it best to think twice. The Middle East is a tinderbox waiting to explode and China, North Korea, Iran & Russia will side most likely against us if Syria is invaded, i hope not. All these are secretive Nations we do not know what their war capacities really are, do we? China would be a formidable enemy. Lastly, how would we react to all the bombs raining down on our Western Cities and the devestation it would create to all who would suffer. Like John Lennons Hit song IMAGINE. Why can we not all live together on this planet? Why can so many not accept and respect the peoples of all nations, all colours and creed. At the same time i would resist MUSLIMS taking over or muscling in. These ones lucky enough to live in a Western country because we still enjoy many freedoms other countries do not enjoy. They the radical Muslims should leave and go back to their country of origin if they can not assimilate and blend in and enjoy the freedoms they do not have. Religion does not come before Country and State. As you can see i can see both side of these questions but i resent being lied to if we are by those very people we all vote for to run our countries. I must say we were fortunate in Australia to have the PM Howard/Costello team for 11 years and even that topic would start an argument. That is ok, all are free to and have a right to their opinions, it is just that i do not share their opinions, that is all. These topics would make a great debate.",1380153600,9,4870,4.293478260869565
8583982,5,B00COGQUOI,"I watched the film, coincidentally, on the day the Bradley Manning verdict came down. Manning's not one of the featured whistleblowers in the film, but they four who are share much the same story: they tried to do the right thing and suffered the consequences. Usually that means losing your job, being blacklisted from government and corporate jobs, huge legal bills, and worse. The film also features the journalists who help blow the whistle, and highlights the perils they also face - generally cutting off access so that they cannot continue as reporters on government or military issues. Anyone who cares about their country should watch this film and then push to support whistleblower protections. Highly Recommended.",1375228800,18,725,5.205128205128205
