8164123,5,B000LSBX6Q,"Jeff Berlin is bass guitar virtuoso with very strong opinions on music education. His views have caused some consternation in the musical community and have rankled many other musicians of all skill levels. Berlin's views are rooted in time tested methods of learning musical content by diligent practice, patience and mistakes. He also eschews the use of metronomes as practice tools, tablature and hand strengthening devices. Jeff Berlin stresses learning chord tones played in root positions and inversions, reading music and learning the language of jazz for it's harmonic content. All of this is extremely sound advice for an aspirant wishing to make a career as a working musician. Berlin doesn't offer tips, tricks or shortcuts to musicianship nor does he peddle ""secret"" esoteric nonsense designed to prey on young people. I suspect the controversy caused by his ideas are rooted in the fact that most people who profess to love the bass guitar don't want to put it in the work and the time to learn the necessary musical content. Many young people are swayed by the fact that there are famous musicians who pride themselves in not knowing how to read music or knowing any basic harmony. What young people need to  understand, as Berlin has stressed on numerous occasions, is that having a successful band doesn't qualify you to be a teacher of music. Aside from the lucky few who get record deals and make a fortune that is an invisible group of session players, teachers and performers who have studied the requirements of music and it's this group that should be the role models. Jeff Berlin is an evangelist for proper learning methods and you should listen to him and study music.",1509235200,3,1693,4.919580419580419
8164124,5,B000LSBX6Q,"I've been a fan of Jeff's for years and appreciate his dedication to the improvement of musicians world wide.
I saw a short clip of this DVD and went right out and purchased it afterwards.
Jeff provides many useful insights on playing, practicing and what musicians should concentrate on.
The instructional section is very useful and all musicians will benefit from this.
Very worthwhile DVD on many levels.",1299974400,,407,5.0
8164125,3,B000LSBX6Q,"As this is my first review, I'll keep it short.  I was not impressed with this dvd as an instructional presentation.  It is mostly, as it says, Jeff Berlin's discussion of his philosophy regarding various fundamental teaching options. My problem is that Jeff takes 8 minutes to convey each of his points of view, when 1-2 minutes on each subject would be sufficient, then move on to something more, like real instruction, or technique or something. The jam sessions at the end are very good, he is awesome, and probably the highlight of the dvd.  In summary, if you are looking for a dvd to improve your playing, look elsewhere.  If you want to know in great detail why Jeff doesn't like using metronomes or tuners, get this disc.  I believe Jeff could have made this much more useful, but choose not to.",1212537600,4,804,4.594405594405594
8164126,5,B000LSBX6Q,"Well, what can i say. I attended Musicians Institute from 03/93 to 03/94, Jeff was my idol until he said ""I don't want you to consider me your idol"".Then he became my instructor. As on DVD he will tell you to don't practice technique, and I always felt that he meant that there is not standard technique. Only the one that works for you. I agree with him in most of things except the Slap technique issue. I was also with Alexis Sklarevski, and yes, I believe that Slap is something that should be studied as part of the instrument. Besides that, I think Jeff is the Noam Chomsky of music education. I heard most of these philosophies on my 3rd quarter at MI so most of them are not new, but they are better explained on the DVD.",1198627200,,729,4.251798561151079
