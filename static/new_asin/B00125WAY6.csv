3077519,5,B00125WAY6,Fans of the modern Sabrina will find this older series very different but just as entertaining. For one thing Salem had never been a warlock and doesn't talk but does have his own magic.  Also the witch community believe that witches are meant to be evil and keep trying to train Sabrina into putting a hex of people especially her school friends.  Other that Harvey must of her regular school friends quickly get faded out and replaced with other Archie characters who had their own series at the same time and voice actors.,1212192000,,525,4.634408602150538
3077520,5,B00125WAY6,"At long last, the original animated incarnation of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH finally makes her very auspicious DVD debut.  Genius Products, in tandem with its other ARCHIES releases, brings you a 3-DVD set of the original Filmation animated series featuring all 31 episodes.

Sabrina made her first appearance in the ARCHIE'S MADHOUSE comic series and gained a fair amount of popularity, eventually spawning her own comic book.  Filmation brought Sabrina to animation in the prime-time special ARCHIE AND HIS NEW PALS, and eventually spun off her own series after showcasing her as part of THE ARCHIE COMEDY HOUR.  The resulting cartoons depict Sabrina as a resident of Riverdale and a student at Riverdale High, accompanied in her adventures by her boyfriend Harvey and her friends Spencer and Ophelia (who respectively serve Jughead and Betty functions to Harvey's Archie).

However, as our title says, Sabrina IS a witch, and therefore must keep her magical abilities a secret from the Riverdale denizens.  Though witches are expected to hex people, the good-natured Sabrina often uses her powers in attempts to help others or solve problems, usually with disastrous results.  Most of the plots revolve around Sabrina's attempts to juggle her witchly studies and her teenage life, featuring her magical cat Salem and her two aunts, the cantankerous Hilda and the kindhearted Zelda.  There is also Cousin Ambrose, a sophisticated, somewhat bon-vivant warlock who is more sympathetic to Sabrina's teenhood and occasionally aids her in her adventures, serving as a mixture of the Dr. Bombay and Uncle Arthur characters from BEWITCHED.  The ARCHIES crew makes regular appearances, with Reggie continuously (and unsuccessfully) trying to out Sabrina as a witch to the rest of the gang.

And of course, there are the GROOVIE GOOLIES.  Yep, this set not only has all of the Sabrina episodes from her own series, but ALSO the episodes in which everyone's favorite gang of maladroit monsters made their FIRST appearances.  Mixing the Goolies, the Archies and Sabrina together creates a special blend of comic chaos, and these episodes do not disappoint.  As a special feature, the set includes the first episode of THE ARCHIE AND SABRINA SURPRISE PACKAGE, in which Archie, Sabrina and the gang work together to solve a mystery at Riverdale.  (Will this series be a future DVD release?  Only time will tell.)

The set is colorfully packaged, though not in a clear slipcase like the other ARCHIES releases, and the artwork is of the usual excellent standard.  The episodes appear to be sourced from the best materials, showing clear pictures and few signs of aging.  The DVD holder is a bit difficult to operate at first (the first two discs are overlapped, placing the click-tabs on the sides rather than in the middle), so examine carefully rather than tear into it.

Pick up this set if you're an ARCHIES or SABRINA fan, and pair it with the GROOVIE GOOLIES set for the right mix of supernatural Saturday-Morning silliness.  You'll see her tug her ear... and you'll see your blues disappear.  Count on it.",1211500800,27,3100,5.086956521739131
3077521,4,B00125WAY6,"Originally broadcast in 1969, the ""Sabrina"" TV cartoon series was spun off from the ""Archie"" comics franchise, and shared the same herky-jerky, repetitive animation and canned laugh-tracks as the ""Archie"" cartoons, as well as the same bubblegum-hip pop music and even the same locale.  Sabrina, a teenage magicmaker placed somewhere between TV's ""Bewitched"" and Harvey Comics' ""Wendy The Good Little Witch"", went to school at Riverdale High along with Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica, and even though her powers kept making people turn into animals and all sorts of wacky things happen, she still was able to keep her magic powers a secret.  The cast of the ""Sabrina"" cartoons mirrored the ""Archie"" series - there was her well-meaning boyfriend Harvey, who was kinda Archie-lite, and his best friend the Jughead-ish oddball.  But back home there was a whole different family life, with two witchie-poo aunties who tried to push her (ala ""Casper"") into being more wicked, and a goofy, rotund warlock cousin straight out of the ""Bewitched"" playbook.  The stories were pretty silly, dumb even, but there is an innocence about them that is still appealing, and the groovy rock music interludes are good, kitschy fun. Plus, she had a magic cat!  How cool is that?!?  This 3-DVD box set will thrill nostalgic baby-boomers, but may delight their kids and grand-kids as well. (ReadThatAgain kid's reviews)",1210896000,3,1401,5.176991150442478
3077522,5,B00125WAY6,"I'd never heard much about this cartoon prior to its DVD release, and many people I've spoken to aren't familiar with it either. But after so far only watching one disc out of the three included, I can affirmatively say that I haven't enjoyed a cartoon so effortlessly and thoroughly in a long time. It has all the right ingredients: bright, vivid colors; enchanting character personalities; creative storylines with lots of innocent and belly-ache humor.

After watching a few episodes, I was surprised to see how many of the fundamental aspects of this series were retained for the 90's sitcom version. There are some key differences. For instance, this cartoon feeds more into traditional stereotypes of witches as doing evil deeds (a priority for Aunt Hilda here), whereas the 90's sitcom presents them in a more positive light. But it's all done in a lighthearted way. However, Sabrina's boyfriend has the same name (Harvey), and Salem is also around.",1209772800,14,956,5.012578616352202
3077523,5,B00125WAY6,I grew up in the 1970's running to the TV every Saturday morning to watch my favorite show...Sabrina The Teenage Witch!! I loved her magic and wished I could have that same type magic when I was a kid.  I was very happy when they brought the character back in the 90's with Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina but this is the original Sabrina and none is as good or as much fun!!! I cant really add much that hasn't already been posted except its a great treat to have my old childhood pal back!! The picture color is excellent and the stories (some of which includes appearances by The Archies & Groovy Goolies) are nothing but pure fun and imagination!! Check it out!!!! If you like the 90's Melissa Joan Hart Sabrina try out the REAL Sabrina...I think you will love her!! Thank you for releasing this and making a long time dream of mine come true!!!!!!,1209427200,8,849,4.3734177215189876
3077524,5,B00125WAY6,"Now you can enjoy Sabrina the Teen-age Witch, her tail-zapping red cat Salem, her witchy aunts Hilda and Zelda, her warlock-cousin Ambrose, and Head Witch Miss Della in all 31 episodes from the original FILMation animated series.

In its initial concept stage, this series was supposed to feature the teen-age versions of Samantha and Darrin from ""Bewitched"", but the producers were uncomfortable with Samantha dominating the airwaves on both ABC and CBS.  With the success of ""The Archie Show"", Norm Prescott, Lou Scheimer, and Hal Sutherland turned to a lesser-known Archie Comics character who appeared in ""Madhouse Comics"", Sabrina.  Instead of twitching her nose to trigger her magic, they had Sabrina tug her ear.  Stories focused on high school situations to relate to young Saturday morning viewers, and Archie and the gang even guest-starred in some of the episodes.  (Eventually, Samantha and Darrin's children, Tabitha and Adam Stephens, starred in their own cartoon on ""The Saturday Superstar Movie"" on ABC.  The episode was called ""Tabitha, Adam and the Clown Family"", and it was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions.  The animation was rushed and choppy, and it was extremely inferior compared to the Sabrina series on CBS.)

Fans old and new will enjoy seeing Sabrina's enormous bedroom and her ""groovy"" broom with the big flower roof!  Some of the stunning special effects were used in Melissa Joan Hart's 1996 series based on the character (i.e., the magic dust and flashes of light).  Even the ear tug was utilized in Hart's series.  If you recall, teen-witch Dreama tugged her ear to make magic.

So what are you waiting for?  This series has it all - - a cute concept, a hilarious cast of characters, clever writing, and a whole lot of FUN!  ""Sabrina the Teen-age Witch"" is definitely a must-have for your personal DVD library!!",1205798400,21,1849,5.079470198675497
3077525,4,B00125WAY6,"Forget the modern live show. This is how it all started, Filmation's spin-off from the Archie series, and you'll see more Archie coming out around the same time with ""Archie's Funhouse"".
Order them both.",1204588800,,203,5.0
3077526,5,B00125WAY6,"Before Melissa Joan Hart, before the DIC Animation, there was the original Sabrina by Filmation Studios.  Once a one-shot character in the Archie Comics' Madhouse Comics, Sabrina instantly became a sensation as the 'Teenage Witch,' and quickly gained her own comic.

About the same time, when Filmation was searching for new shows to air, Dan DeCarlo suggested Sabrina, who not only guest starred on Archie's Funhouse, but also on the Groovie Ghoolies as well.

The interesting thing about the original series was, it was sort of a combination between 'Bewitched' and 'Wendy the Good Little Witch.'  Basically, Sabrina not only had to conceal her identity (odd since both Aunt Hilda and Zelda remained in their witchly attire, while Sabrina did not), but had to deal with the fact, as a witch, she wasn't supposed to perform good deeds.  Harvey was Sabrina's mortal boyfriend, which Aunt Hilda wasn't too particularly fond off, same way Endora felt about Darrin.

The stories usually dealt with witchly aspects colliding with the normal situations, and ironically Archie and the Gang would also get embroiled in the antics, since here, Sabrina actually attended Riverdale High as well.

Overall, this collection has well been worth the wait and hopefully will bring back lots of fun memories of how Sabrina really was to both fans new and old.",1204502400,7,1343,5.077272727272727

Order them both.",1204588800,,203,5.0
3312023,5,B00125WAY6,"Before Melissa Joan Hart, before the DIC Animation, there was the original Sabrina by Filmation Studios.  Once a one-shot character in the Archie Comics' Madhouse Comics, Sabrina instantly became a sensation as the 'Teenage Witch,' and quickly gained her own comic.

About the same time, when Filmation was searching for new shows to air, Dan DeCarlo suggested Sabrina, who not only guest starred on Archie's Funhouse, but also on the Groovie Ghoolies as well.

The interesting thing about the original series was, it was sort of a combination between 'Bewitched' and 'Wendy the Good Little Witch.'  Basically, Sabrina not only had to conceal her identity (odd since both Aunt Hilda and Zelda remained in their witchly attire, while Sabrina did not), but had to deal with the fact, as a witch, she wasn't supposed to perform good deeds.  Harvey was Sabrina's mortal boyfriend, which Aunt Hilda wasn't too particularly fond off, same way Endora felt about Darrin.

The stories usually dealt with witchly aspects colliding with the normal situations, and ironically Archie and the Gang would also get embroiled in the antics, since here, Sabrina actually attended Riverdale High as well.

Overall, this collection has well been worth the wait and hopefully will bring back lots of fun memories of how Sabrina really was to both fans new and old.",1204502400,7,1343,5.077272727272727
