4214781,5,B003X2P9C6,I bought this along with several other DVD's to upgrade from VHS that we use in our Kindergarten class room.  Received them in a few days and they were all new and in complete packaging.,1373155200,2,186,4.314285714285714

4214783,4,B003X2P9C6,"with paul giamatti reading the true story of the three little pigs, the kids sat glued to the screen as they waited to see what the wolf would do next. the combination of a great storyline and creative animation made for a great movie treat for all of us. the kids also enjoyed the interview with jon scieszka and lane smith at the end of the dvd. i was surprised that they were willing to sit and listen to how the book came into being as the two men joked around together.

we also enjoyed zach braff's narration of wallace's lists, by barbara bottner and gerald kruglik. we hadn't read this story before but we enjoyed watching as wallace learned to live a little more adventurously.

henry builds a cabin, by d.b. johnson was a great story about simplicity. afterward, we learned about henry david thoreau and the cabin he built by walden pond.

we love the rollicky-rhythm of this is the house that jack built by simms tabeck. there is a surprise character at the end of this one that no one was expecting (not even zoe!).

the only one we found a little strange was the pigs' wedding by helme heine. nobody complained about it, but when it was over, we all remarked on the strangeness of the story.

all in all, i am glad to have this dvd as a part of our collection. i look forward to more selections from scholastic storybook treasures.",1291593600,15,1344,4.425101214574899

4214788,4,B003X2P9C6,"I saw this and checked it out of the library. For younger children it's just a fun story. For older children in combination with ""How to write Fractured Fairy Tales"" it's a great introduction to creative writing, point of view etc. I also like the back of the book that has questions under ""think about it""

If you want to really know if this book is for you, go to your local library. If they don't have a copy there is always the option of the Inter-Library Loan procedure (books usually take about 3 weeks to arrive). I almost always preview books from the library before purchasing ... it has saved a lot of disappointment.",1428969600,,627,4.452173913043478
