2176041,4,B00068S3KU,"This was the first interactive PPV in the WWE.  The fans voted online to determine opponents, match types, and stipulations.  It was a good idea, and ended up being a pretty decent PPV, although it could have been maybe a little better.

1. Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho (Intercontinental Title)

The fans chose Jericho's opponent for the match.  Good way to kick off the show, although it was a little unfortunate that the crowd was pretty much out of the match.  Good match.  It started a little slow, but ended strong.  Good finish, with a lot of reversals and near falls.  Personally, I thought this was the best match of the night.  (8/10)

2. Trish Stratus vs. Stacy Keibler vs. Jazz vs. Victoria vs. Molly Holly vs. Gail Kim vs. Nidia (Women's Title/Battle Royal)

The fans got to decide which outfit the ladies would were in this match.  They chose the school girl outfits.  Actually, this was not a bad Battle Royal.  Good performance by the women.  (6.5/10)

3. Gene Snitzky vs. Kane (Steel Chain Match)

This was the match in which the fans chose the weapon the two would use.  I thought Snitzky would be terrible, but he put forth a really good effort.  The match was a little slow, but pretty brutal.  Amazing spot when Snitzky jumps off the second rope and steps on the chair that was across Kane's neck.  Could not believe it.  (7.5/10)

4. Eugene vs. Eric Bischoff (Loser Loses Hair)

The fans got to choose the stipulation in the match.  Very short match, but the aftermath is pretty long, but very funny.  Coach and Vince make appearances in the match.  (6.5/10)

5. Chris Benoit & Edge vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles)

The two that lost the voting for the World Heavyweight Title would be teamed together for this match, Edge and Benoit.  Very, very, very slow and boring match that really dragged on.  It was way too predictable on what would happen in the match, although the outcome was not predictable.  Exciting, emotional ending.  (6/10)

6. Carmella vs. Christy (Pillow Fight)

The fans got to choose the match type for this one.  It actually took longer for the two to change, than the actual match itself.  Very hot match.  (5.5/10)

7. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title)

The fans chose H's opponent for this match.  HBK was legitimetley hurt in this match.  He put on a very inspiring effort.  He had to be in a lot of pain during the match.  Triple H has to be given credit for doing a good job in working with his injured foe.  I thought the ending was once again way too predictable.  Batista and Edge make appearances.  This is given a higher score, not because of the quality of the match, but because of HBK's effort.  (8/10)

8. Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair (Steel Cage Match)

Again, the fans got to choose the match type here.  About what would be expected from a Flair cage match.  Kind of slow, but very exciting and bloody.  Good finish.  Flair and Orton both put on a good performance.  (8/10)

Good PPV.  I think it is up in the air on wheter to pick this one up or not.  The matches are good, but not the best.  But, there were a lot of shockers and good storyline set ups in this PPV.  Which is something the WWE has not really been doing at their PPV's.

La Resistance vs. Edge & Chris Beniot.
This Match should not have been on this ppv. Eventhough it is the first ever *Fans Vote* stipulation. This match sucks...

Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal / Woman's Championship

Trish vs. Victoria vs. Molly vs. Jazz vs. Nidia vs. Gail Kim & Stacy Keibler. (School Girl Outfits)
Now I must say this was a great match than what I expected.. And plus we get to see School Girl Outfits... I Loved It

Christy vs. Carmella

**Waste of time** Please skip this match. You are not missing a thing... they spent 15 minutes getting dressed. Pls don't waste your time on this one.

Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin / Intercontinental Championship

This was a pure wrestling match. Chris Jericho is a great wrestler and so is Shelton Benjamin (Well at least at this time). Match gets 4 stars cause the action was nice.

Kane vs. Snitsky / Steel Chain Match

Now with snitsky's name alone you would think that this match would suck.. well it was ok. Two big men in the ring battling w/ steel chain in play was ok. This match 3 1/2 stars. The ending is worth seeing on this DVD.

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair / Steel Cage Match

This match was by far the best match on the card. 5 stars. A young Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair. This is one of the better matches that I have seen Randy Orton in. This match went back and forth... Plus there was a great ending to this match also. Ric Flair showed that he still has *it*

Eugene vs Eric Bishoff / Head Shaved

Now the match was a waste of time, but the head shaving is one of the funniest things ever. Vince McMahon comes down and it gets krayzie.. Skip the match and watch the Head shaving.

Triple H vs Shawn Michaels / World Heavyweight Championship

This match was just like all the other matches. Now Triple H and Shawn are two of the best in the business. But this match didn't really do it for me. The excitement of this match wasn't there. If you are a wrestling fan then you know that Triple H and Shawn Michaels have faught several times and we all have our favorites.. Overall this match was a 3.5 b/c of the names. They have had better matches.

The overall DVD is ok. If you like wrestling then you can purchase this disc. You are not missing anything by not seeing the *First Ever Interactive Show* that WWE has done.",1194480000,,2330,4.358796296296297

October 19, 2004
Milwaukee, Wisconsin

1) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (C) vs. Shelton Benjamin
Great opener. Very fasted paced match.
Winner: Shelton Benjamin 4/5

2) Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (C) vs. Victoria vs. Molly Holly vs. Jazz vs. Nidia vs. Stacy Keibler
Alright womens battle royal but nothing great.
Winner: Trish 2/5

3) Chain Match
Kane vs. Gene Snitsky
This was a decent match lots of action with the chain but the match never really ends but it does, Snitsky brings out a chair and breaks Kane's neck and the match stops. Good match never the less. about a solid 15 minutes of action with the chain.
Winner: Gene Snitsky 3.5/5

4) Hair Match
Eugene vs. Eric Bishoff
Personally Eugene doesn't belong in the WWE but Bishoff and Vince makes this match funny to watch towards the end.
Winner: Eugene 2/5

5) Tag Team Championship
Edge & Chris Benoit vs. La Resistance (C)
An alright tag match, Benoit makes this match watchable after Edge leaves the match about half way in but Benoit wins the belts all by himself.
Winner: Chris Benoit & Edge 3.5/5

6) Lingerie Pillow Fight
Christy Hemme vs. Carmella
The only good thing about this match is the girls in lingerie. The way they get undressed before the match is sexy too now that is what to watch in this match. The ending sucks though.
Winner: Christy 1.5/5

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H (C) vs. Shawn Michaels
Great match even though HBK hurt before the match even started but like always HBK ans HHH puts a good match on when they are together. Awesome Match. Edge comes back and screws HBK.
Winner: Triple H 4/5

8) Steel Cage Match
Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair
Awesome cage match. Lots of blood. Orton does take a shot with the brass knucks at the end and thought Flair was going to win but Orton kicks out. Orton wins with the RKO. The ending is very suprising. Watch the end, it will shock the hell out of you. Not the best cage match but pretty damn good.
Winner: Randy Orton 4.5/5",1170374400,,2009,4.623595505617978
2176063,3,B00068S3KU,"1. Rey Mysterio & Matt Hardy vs. Snitsky & Chris Masters

Originally, Edge came out, but then refused to wrestle so Snitsky came out to take his place. This match could have been better if Edge was wrestling, because Mysterio and Hardy had to carry most of, if not the entire match. Snitsky is dreadful in the ring, and Masters is still developing at this point. This is still a good opener that gets the crowd pumped up for the show. Rey and Matt put on good performances, and do some cool moves. Pretty good match, worth a watch. 6/10

2. Eugene & Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko

Pretty boring, considering none of these men, other then Superfly, are capable of putting on anything more then a snoozefest of a match. Conway is pretty limited, and Tomko and Eugene were never meant to be wrestling in the first place, and are simply awful. The only noteworthy spot of the match is Superfly getting tagged in to wrestle for about 15 seconds, then going off the top rope for the splash. The rest is poorly wrestled, bland, and boring. 2/10

3. Three Faces of Foley Match: Mankind vs. Carlito

I'm glad that the fans picked Mankind as the face of Foley to face Carlito, because Mankind had not been seen for quite some time in the WWE, and it was refreshing. Carlito is similar in that he is something new and different for the WWE, and he brings life to the ring when he steps in. He has great character, and his in ring skills, though not fantastic here, have greatly improved since. He is entertaining here, and him and Foley put on a good show. Short, but it was never meant to be a wrestling classic, just a fun match to keep the show moving. Both Foley and Carlito put on good performances. 7/10

4. World Tag Team Championship Match: Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs. Kane & Big Show

This one suprised me, because I thought this would be boring and slow. At some parts it is, but it picks up in a few places, and is overall entertaining. It does its job by putting over Kane and Big Show as the new tag team on Raw, and they work well together. Cade and Murdoch hold this one down a little, but it doesn't hurt the match too much. Worth a watch. 6/10

5. Street Fight Match: Batista vs. Jonathan Coachman w/ Goldust and Vader

I think the original plan was to have Austin face Coach, but that fell apart so instead the WWE picked the Animal himself to face good ol' Coach. Anyway, this is quite short and there really isn't much to this one, except for Coach getting beaten pretty badly. Basically a time filler, you can skip this and you won't miss much. 3/10

6. Fufill Your Fantasy Battle Royal Match for the Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (c) vs. Ashley vs. Candice Michelle vs. Mickie James vs. Maria vs. Victoria

The fans decided that the Divas should wrestle the match in lingerie, and I am not complaining about that decision at all. Other then Victoria, this match is very ""easy on the eyes"" if you know what I mean, and isn't that bad. Trish and Maria make the match for me, this is certainly worth a watch for the lovely eye candy. 5/10

7. Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship: Ric Flair (c) vs. Triple H

As Joey Styles stated, this match was not really for the Intercontinental Championship, but was extremely personal. Triple H completed the demise of Evolution by beating his former best friend to a bloody pulp. Flair seeks revenge inside of the 15 foot high Steel Cage, and Triple H dominates a majority of this match. Flair comes back swinging, literally (you'll see what I mean), and escapes the cage after going through a brutal 24 minutes. He proves he can still wrestle one hell of a match, and this sets up their rematch at Survivor Series in a Last Man Standing Match, where Triple H is the one seeking revenge. A great match, these two click and make this one bloody, brutal brawl. 9/10

8. Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: John Cena (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels

Cena really didn't have to do much in this match, because the fans voted HBK as the third man in this match, and when you put the Showstopper and the olympic gold medalist in the same ring, you're going to get a good, if not great, match. All three men put on good performances, and HBK and Angle continue their rivalry by taking out Cena with an announce table spot and fighting by themselves for a good 5 minutes. HBK proves that he deserved the fans votes for the second year in a row at this event, and all three men work very well here. Good match, everybody has chemistry together and this is one of Cena's best title defenses. 8.5/10

Taboo Tuesday is better then the previous years' event, and is overall, a pretty good PPV. The undercard leaves a lot to be desired, but the uppercard is good. Two great matches and a few fun matches make this one worth watching.

Match of the Night: The Steel Cage match: Ric Flair vs. Triple H. This is a bloodbath, but a damn entertaining one at that. These two work very well together, and the Nature Boy proves that hes still got it. Great match, don't miss this one.",1151798400,4,5075,4.416488222698073
2176064,5,B00068S3KU,"This my friends is BETTER than the 1st Taboo Tuesday.

Taboo Tuesday had some good matches and this also marked the 1 RAW Brand PPV w/o Jim Ross, but it was great to see Joey Styles on there and he and The King did a pretty good job if I might add, plus all of the RAW Titles (The original WWE Titles) were on the line also.

Snitsky & Masters vs. Rey Mysterio & Matt Hardy-RAW vs. SD! Match- This was an AWESOME way to start the match, I mean you had the 2 High Flyers Hardy & Rey cleaning house on Stitsky & Masters and Rey wins in his Hometown of San Diego, CA, a great way to start the show.

Eugene/Superfly vs. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko-Pretty good match, but it was Hacksaw, Kamala, and Superfly putting Tomko in his place, and Rob Conway should learn to NEVER mess w/the legends of WWE.

Mick Foley vs. Carlito-Foley comes out as Mankind (I wanted for him to be Cactus Jack)-Pretty Good Match even though it didn't last too long, I'm glad that Foley put Carlito in his place.

Cade & Murdoch vs. Kane & Big Show-WWE RAW World Tag Team Championship-It was an easy match for the challengers and @ the end Kane & Big Show were VICTORIOUS, and I'm glad that they've won the Titles, until that STUPID Spirit Squad took it from them the night after Mania 22.

Batista vs. The Coach-This was an easy match, but I'm glad that Coach got put in his place.

Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal for the WWE Women's World Title (Lingerie)-Trish, Victoria, and Mickie James are the only TRUE athletes in the ring, but they should've made this, a choice of either TLC, 6-Pack Challenge, or a 6 Woman Steel Cage Match, and they need some more REAL Women on there like Lita, Melina, and Jillian Hall.

Triple H vs. Ric Flair STEEL CAGE MATCH for the WWE I-C Heavyweight Championship-Of course me being a Cage Match Fanatic, THIS STOLE THE SHOW, Flair put a hurting on The Game, and then delivers 3 Chair Shots to Triple H and then escapes out of the cage for the win, and Joey Styles said it best, ""I was blessed to call that match"". AWESOME!

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle vs. HBK (I'm glad I chose HBK)-Triple Threat Match for the WWE RAW World Heavyweight Championship-This was INDEED AWESOME much like the ones that I saw @ VENGEANCE 2002, 2003, & 2005, I mean all 3 of them exchanging move after move, but @ the end it was Cena w/the DVD to pick up the win, AWESOME MATCH!

Also here's some info: HBK has participated in 2 Heavyweight Title Matches @ TT, Trish & Victoria have participated in 2 FYF Battle Royals @ TT, Ric Flair has participated in 2 Steel Cage Match @ TT, Eugene & Trish are 2-0 @ TT, and the WWE RAW World Tag Team Titles have changed hands twice @ TT, Chris Benoit def. Le Resistance & Kane & Big Show def. Cade & Murdoch.

This is a Must Buy for all Taboo Tuesday fans, plus it's worth the money to see the Steel Cage Match & the Triple Threat Match.

Extras on there are the WWE Championship story, Christian's last interveiw w/the WWE, Matt Striker's Classroom (Skip on that one), and Batista talking to Ric Flair now that is worth watching.

Also 2005 VENGEANCE, 2005 Unforgiven, and 2005 Taboo Tuesday are worth buying to see the Cage Matches, but also to see my girl, the RAW Queen VICTORIA in action.",1151280000,2,3215,4.311774461028192

2176088,2,B00068S3KU,I made a mistake by buying this god awful dvd. There was only only one or two good matches. First of all you have to be crazy to put Batista and Jonathin coathman in the same ring together. Second of all the cage match between HHH and Ric Flair might have been interesting if Flair wasn't 80 years old. I also expected Snuka & Eugene v.s Conway and Tonko to be good but it put me to sleep.we already knew who was going to win the tag tittle match and we were right. I was happy to see Foley back in action but agianst Carlito Come on. I give this match a thumb down and a middle finger up. Altho the PPV wasn't all bad. I give the main event 9 stars. I would've Given it ten but I hated the outcome. I think that HBK diserved the gold. Even though I'm a RAW man I enjoyed the tag opener between Rey & Matt Hardy V.S Masters and Snitsky. And I can't complain about the battle royal. The only reason you should buy this DVD is if You want to kill yourself or if you ran out of toilet paper.  P.S.

  Great opening contest. Would have rather seen Edge team up with Masters but he could not due to injury. Hardy and Rey worked very well together. Smackdown wins.

Eugene & Jimmy Sunka Vs. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko

Waste of time, but it was good to see Sunka back in the ring. It was also good to see Jim Duggan and Kamala run-in at the end. Snuka and Eugene win.

Mankind Vs. Carlito

Great to see Mick back in a WWE ring. I figured that Cactus Jack would have gotten the vote, but it was Mankind. Foley wins with a ""cool"" version of Socko.

World Tag Team Title Match

Kane & Big show vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Merdoch

Big Show and Kane dominate this one. Who will be able to stop them? If the WWE does the right thing, they should be champs for along time.

Street Fight

Batista vs Coach w/ Vader & Goldust

Would not call this one a street fight but Batista destroys Coach in just a few minutes. Cool to see Vader back. He needs to lose weight and make a come back. Batista hits him with a spinebuster.

Intercontinetal Championship - Cage Match

Ric Flair vs Triple H

Best match of the night. A definite show-stealer! Flair and Hunter brutalize each other. I figure Triple H would win, but the Nature Boy pulls it out.

Awesome match! John Cena retains the title when he hits the FU on HBK. Great Ending for a greta PPV!",1137542400,2,1529,4.347517730496454
2176091,4,B00068S3KU,"To be honest, I didn't expect a lot but I was plesantly surprised by this card. Here is my view on WWE Taboo Tuesday:

Rey Mysterio/Matt Hardy Vs. Snitsky/Chris Masters - Originally, it was supposed to be Edge in this RAW Vs. Smackdown bout but Edge bowed out at the last minute saying he was through with Hardy. In reality, Edge had a legit injury to his pec muscle and they used the recent feud as an excuse.

As for this match, I have to saw while I am a RAW fan (have been since the split), I got to give credit where its due. Hardy/Mysterio DEFINITELY should've won this bout (which they did)! Snitsky and Masters weren't the best duo to put in there against those two though they did account for themselves decently. A pretty good match overall.

Rob Conway/Tyson Tomko Vs. Eugene/""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka - Nothing spetacular here. Just a feel good bout. It was good to see Snuka again though! ;)

Mankind Vs. Carlito - Again, nothing special too much here. Just a feel good moment when Foley gets the mandible claw on Carlito!

Lance Cade/Trevor Murdoch Vs. Big Show/Kane (WWE RAW World Tag Team Title Match) - Its too bad WWE Creative won't put anything behind tag teams anymore because Cade/Murdoch wasn't a bad duo. The right thing to do would've been too have them somehow upset the two big men but that's not how things go in WWE these days I guess! Kane/Show take it after several minutes of good double teaming by Cade/Murdoch!

Batista Vs. The Coach w/Goldust/Vader - Ugliest match on the card and I don't mean that in a good way! Its too bad Batista's guest appearance on a RAW PPV was wasted this way! I know some fans dissed ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin for walking out on this match BUT I pretty much don't blame him now that I've seen what it turned into! Anyway, Batista wins after his ""Batista"" bomb on Coach (probably the best moment of the match)!

Trish Stratus Vs. Ashley Vs. Candice Michelle Vs. Mickie James (the former Alexis Lalrey for OVW) Vs. Maria Vs. Victoria (WWE Women's Title Bout) - I'll be honest, I didn't watch it for skilled wrestling as none of these cats except for the champ (Stratus), Mickie James and Victoria can actually wrestle (Ashley has potential though). I only watched to see what they were wearing! Just being honest! ;)

Ric Flair Vs. Triple H (WWE I-C Title Match in a cage) - EASILY THE BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT! I personally think Flair should retire but I have to give him his due. At mid-50's, he works a better match than most of the wrestlers half his age! HHH deserves credit as well as he has really studied old school wrestling! I, like many fans, don't like his politicing but you can't deny he can put on a great match when wants too! Very gory bout so if you don't like blood, don't watch this match. If you don't mind seeing it, then enjoy a great 20 minutes out of your life!

I also found it ironic (and pretty appropriate actually) that former ECW commetator Joey Styles was calling this match since this is just about as EXTREME as anything in ECW's history!

Shawn Michaels Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. John Cena (WWE Title Match/Triple Threat Rules) - Second best match of the night! Just a little problem with the psychology of it though! 1. Considering Cena's good record in these types of bouts, it would've made more sense to put him in a more precarious situation than a Triple Threat Match! 2. Shawn Michaels kicks out of an Angle Slam from the top rope but can't kick out of an F.U.? I'm sorry, I know I am knitpicking but I have an issue with that!

And no, its not that I am bashing John Cena at all. Cena does his best with what he has but admittedly, he isn't the best competitor in the WWE (let alone RAW). But, he is competent enough to take direction from superior talent such as Michaels and Angle.

Back to the match itself, it was fun to see half the crowd boo Cena while half cheering him. I did notice a lot of fans definitely favoring Angle though over both Cena and Michaels! A good ride to end the show!

Admittedly, I've only looked at one extra and that was the one with Batista talking to Ric Flair after his cage match, making some amends after the split with Evolution when he was on RAW. It was also kind of fun to see him sort of taunt HHH as he was being helped back to the locker room!

Get this card as it is a fun trip. The finally two bouts make it worth it alone!",1137196800,,4360,4.353448275862069
2176092,3,B00068S3KU,"Taboo Tuesday turned out to be alot of better than expected considering all the last minute changes that happened with the card (Tomko teaming with Conway, Stone Cold being replaced with Batista, Edge being replaced by Snitsky).  The only complaint (besides the ""bait & switch"" with Edge & the whole Austin situation) is that eventhough they said it was an ""interactive"" PPV, they really rigged & had RAW booked weeks before for certain matches would be guarenteed (Flair begging for a cage, having Big Show & Kane in tag matches, HBK fighting both Angle & Cena in singles matches, bring in Goldust & Vader for The Coach.) Overall, one of the better PPV's for the WWE this past year...but that's not saying much.

Matt Hardy & Rey Mysterio (SmackDown) vs. Chris Masters & Gene Snitsky (RAW) - Better tag team match than I expected.  The crowd was way over for the SmackDown team.

Eugene & Jimmy Snuka vs. Tyson Tomko & Rob Conway - Nothing special here except for the the appearence of Snuka along with Hacksaw Jim Duggan & Kamala at the end.

Mankind vs. Carlito - Average match.  Only thing worth talking about is how Mr. Socko looked just like Carlito (afro included).

Tag Team Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock vs. Big Show & Kane - This match shows how much WWE cares about tag teams anymore.  They had Cade & Murdock hyped up for a month via video skits, they came in & win the World Tag Team Titles only to lose them to these two singles guys with no history together a month later only to be broken up the next month.  It wasn't a squash match as Cade & Murdock was able to get some offence in but you just knew those guys were gonna get their butts kicked.

Street Fight: World Heavyweight Champion Batista (SmackDown) vs. The Coach (RAW) - First of all, even if Austin was in this match...it made no sense to have Goldust & Vader involved in the match concidering how we haven't seen them since nor did we see them in the WWE a long time before this event.  Second of all, did anyone think the ""debate"" or ""arm wrestling match"" was going to get picked?  Now that's out the way, this match was a complete squash but was more entertaining & payed off better than what they planned for with Austin (he was suppost to lose thanks to Mark Henry).

Lingere Battle Royal for the Womens Title: Well, concidering the womens division in WWE today...only 3 of them can wrestle while the other ones are just there for their looks & sex appeal...you just know how this one plays out.  But I'll give it extra points because I won't turn down the chance to see divas in lingere.

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair vs. Triple H - Who didn't see this one coming since Flair was begging for a cage match for weeks.  Without a doubt, match of the night as both guys bleed hard just give a great match.  We can say whatever we want about Triple H (and I don't say much positive these days) but he can give a greatest matches in the business when he wants to.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Kurt Angle vs. HBK - After the way they've booked HBK for the past couple of weeks, we knew he was going into this match.  It was a good triple threat match but they couldn't match or come close to the cage match before hand.

DVD extras include Batista talking to Ric Flair backstage after the cage match and confronting Triple H as he leaves, Matt Striker does a promo on the internet, and Christian makes his last WWE appearence talking to Todd Grisham before he heads to TNA.

Again, one of the better WWE PPV's of the year.  It was better than events like Armaggedon, Great American Bash, No Way Out but not on the same level as events like Royal Rumble, ECW One Night Stand, or Vengeance.",1136332800,10,3697,4.4138438880706925

2176097,4,B00068S3KU,"This is the 2nd annual Taboo Tuesday where the Wwe supposedly allows fans to have control over all the matches that take place on the event. While i doubt seriously if the Wwe does actually use the fan's votes to make up this ppv, This show was very good. Here's my opinions on the matches:

1. Fans choose the 2 Smackdown members that will face Raw's Edge & Chris Masters, The match turns out to be:
Edge & Chris Masters Vs. Matt Hardy & Rey Mysterio
Edge walks out of the match before it begins and Snitsky ends up taking his place. This match was a pretty good way to start off the event. There was some nice fast-paced wrestling from Mysterio and the match was able to be entertaining for a lot of its running time. This match was enjoyable. Hardy & Mysterio won. ***1/2

2. Fans choose a Wwe legend that will be Eugene's tag team partner against Rob Conway and Tyson Tomko, It turns out to be Jimmy Snuka
Eugene & Jimmy Snuka Vs. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko
I didn't really care for this match too much. This match was decent. Although it doesn't quite succeed as entertainment at times, It is pretty shocking to see Jimmy Snuka back in the ring. Eugene & Snuka won. **1/2

3. Fans choose which personality Mick Foley will wrestle Carlito under, It turned out to be Mankind
Mankind Vs. Carlito
I was really hoping Foley would wrestle as Cactus Jack in this match. But it turned out that the fans chose Mankind. This match was pretty good and it was nice to see Foley back in the ring. Match was full of action and it was entertaining. Mankind won. ****

4. Whoever the fans choose to join Cena and Angle in the triple threat title main event, The other 2 guys will face Cade & Murdoch for the tag team titles, The fans chose Shawn Michaels to be in the main event, Which left Big Show & Kane to team up in this match
Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch Vs. Kane & Big Show
This match was simply average. I didn't really like this match. Needless to say, Big Show & Kane became the new tag team champions in this match. **

5. Fans choose what Batista and Jonathan Coachman will be facing each other in, And Predictably, It turned out to be a street fight
Batista Vs. Jonathan Coachman [W/ Vader & Goldust]
Only reason this match even caught my attention in the first place is the fact that Vader [A man i thought i would never ever see again in the Wwe] and Goldust appeared in this match. This match was bad and it's the worst match on the event. Batista won. *1/2

6. Fulfill your fantasy battle royal for the Wwe Women's Title
Champion Trish Stratus Vs. Victoria Vs. Mickie James Vs. Candice Michelle Vs. Ashley Vs. Maria
The fans voted that the divas in this match would wrestle in lingerie. Well, This is a lot better than the average divas matches. But this still wasn't that good of a match. There was some ok wrestling from the divas in this match and it's watchable at least one time. Trish retains the Women's title in this match. **1/2

7. Fans choose the type of match that Flair and Triple H would wrestle each other for the Intercontinental title, They chose a steel cage match
Champion Ric Flair Vs. Triple H
This match was awesome. This was a great feud and this was another one of the best feuds that the Wwe had this year. Because of the two extremely high-level competitors in this match, The fact that this is for the Intercontinental title doesn't really mean much. These two guys give it their all in this violent, bloody match. This match was extremely entertaining and it turned out to be yet another classic for both Flair and Triple H. This match is a must-see! ***** [Best match on the event]

8. Triple threat match for the Wwe World Heavyweight Championship
Champion John Cena Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. Shawn Michaels
This match was an excellent match and should be on the list for the best Wwe matches of 2005. It was fast-paced and it was impossible not to get into. Despite all this, The only thing that hurts this match is the fact that well, Cena was able to retain his title yet again. If you ask me, Shawn Michaels should've won this match instead. I would've even been satisfied if Kurt Angle had won the title instead, But Cena kept his belt again and even the fans were dissapointed in the end as they were booing Cena throughout the match and chanting ''Cena sucks!''. But, Even though that happened, This match was great and this too should be seen by every Wwe fan. Cena remains Wwe champion. *****

This pay-per-view was very good. A lot of the matches were good and The show was easy to watch all the way through without having to skip through things. I'd say this show is worth owning. Hope the review helped, Be blessed, And i'm out.",1135641600,,4676,4.377880184331797
2176098,5,B00068S3KU,"1/ Teddy Long and SmackDown! suck

-What did Teddy Long do to deserve being Smackdown GM? If you guys still remember the night he was announced as GM, everybody hated him. He hasn't done one good thing for SmackDown. Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista. This batista is not the batista we had seen in Evolution. The changed, not an animal anymore. And hes got a back injury, he cant carry smackdown. If Vince is a little more smart, bring HHH to Smackdown, instead of creating feud with the Big Show. THE ONLY LEGEND ON SMACKDOWN NOW IS THE UNDERTAKER !!!!

2/John Cena sucks

-in the taboo tuesday main event, HBK kicked out of a angle slam from the top rope. AND HE CAN'T KICK OUT OF A STUPID F.U.

-JOhn cena is still champ because he's making money for Vince McManhon.-

-the stupid McManhon family is turning WWE into a joke. This is wrestling, not a rapping competition

-John Cena can't wrestle, his moves suck

Those are the reasons why you stupid people should stop cheering for John Cena and start booing his @$$.

We miss Eric Bishoff

One more thing, HBK is the one who deserves to be the champ the most, hes been working his @$$ off for this company since his return but he's still behind. Your stupid McManhon

But seriously, I'll be civil and also spell all of my words correctly. I like your husband, for the most part. He's got an album out that's better than 80% of the crap out there.

2176111,4,B00068S3KU,"I like the concept of Taboo Tuesday. Not knowing what's going to take place & allowing the fans to vote on it is superb. The element of surprise is what makes this pay per view.

Raw vs Smackdown

Chris Masters & Edge vs the fans choice of 2 Smackdown superstars

(Matt Hardy, Rey Mysterio, Christian, JBL or Hardcore Holly) 8/10- an excellent match to kickstart the show. it has a surprise before the match gets underway.

Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko vs Eugene & a WWE legend(Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Kamala or Jimmy Snuka) 6/10- nothing out of the ordinary here. a typical Raw match. the ending is the only thing that saves this one from stinking up the show.

Carlito vs Mick Foley( the fans choose 1 of Foley's personas; Mankind, Dude Love or Cactus Jack) 5/10- not much here. even Mick can't carry Carlito. he's retired & still is much better than him.

World Tag Team Championship

Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs the 2 who don't get voted into the main event( Big Show, Shawn Michaels or Kane) 7/10- a better match than expected with a surprise ending.

Jonathan Coachman(w/ Vader & Goldust) vs Batista(the fans choose either a Street Fight, a Verbal Debate or an Arm Wrestling Contest) 4/10- a bad match even with the 2 legends returning. Steve Austin was supposed to fight Coach but disappeared the day before.

Divas Battle Royal( the fans choose the wardrobe[Lingerie, Cheerleader or Leather & Lace] 3/10- the participants were Trish Stratus, Micki James, Victoria, Candace Michelle, Maria & Ashley. not much here. it's lame when the women can be thrown through the ropes to be eliminated.

Triple H vs Ric Flair( fans choose a Submission Match, Falls Count Anywhere or Steel Cage Match) 10/10- this is a match of the year candidate. Flair turns back the clock 20 years with his perfrmance. at 55, Flair shows he still can go.

WWE Championship

Triple Threat Match

John Cena vs Kurt Angle vs fans choice of Kane, Shawn Michaels or Big Show 9/10- an excellent match. the action was back & forth. this is what makes triple threat matches good.

Match #1 Raw v.s Smackdown (Snitsky & Chris Masters v.s Rey Mysterio & Matt Hardy)

Great wat ro kick off the show. Edge left and said he had nothing to prove by beating Hardy again. I Wish for once Rawwould win the Interpromotional matches. Everyone knows Raw is the better Brand. Anyway Smackdown wins with Hardy hitting a Twist of Fate on Masters and Rey Hit the West Coast Pop for the win. 77/100
Winners:Matt Hardy & Rey Mysterio

Match #2 Eugene & Jimmy Snuka V.S Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko

This match Was...It was...Well it SUCKED!but how can i say that when we were expecting to see 1 legend and we got all 3!The match ends When Snuka hits the top rope splash on Conway. 57/100 (would have gotten a 1 but the legends made up for it)

Winners:Jimmy Snuka & Eugene

Match #3 Mankind v.s Carlito

This Match wasn't that great Either. Better than Eugenes match,It still sucked. I LOVED to see Mankind Back in action. The people sitting next to me said they wanted cactas well,Suckes for them! Mankind picked up the win when he used MR.SOCKO!!! 66/100
Winner:Mankind

Match #4 Big Show & Kane v.s Lance Cad & Trevor Murdoch (c)

Very boring match and a slow one at that. The people sitting next to me were chanting ""BORING"" The whole match! The match ended when Kane tagged in Big show and the hit a Double Choke Slam and We have new tag team champs. 59/100

Winners:Kane & Big Show

Match #5(Street Fight) Batista v.s Coach (W/Golddust & Vader)

Street fight?More like Cheap fight! you should skip this match cause it will bore you todeath. It was short to(good thing) they only used 2 weapons (Kendo stick & Belt) Batista Stomped all over Golddust and had a bit of a hard time with Vader. Batista wins whenhe Batista Bomed coach. 58/100

Winner:Batista

Match #6 Diva Battle Royal

i cant rate this but i can say this. WATCH IT!

Match #7 (cage match) Ric Flair (c) V.s  Triple H

WOW!What a Match! Not as good as Edge V.S Hardy but a darn good match! It was nic to see Ric & Triple H fight again (Remember Raw 2002?)anyway this is how it ended. Th Nature Boy Ric Flair Had Triple H in the figure Four leg lock for a while and the The Nature Boy Ric Flair tried to escape the cage but HHH Grabbed him and Ric Grabbed a chair on the way back in. He hit The Game 3 times with the chair and he was able to Escape the cage. 92/100

Winner:Ric Flair

Main Event:John Cena(c) V.S Kurt Angle V.S HBK

I voted for HBK and was happy to see he was in the great Main Event. IWasn't happy to see Cena Retain. I miss him being heel when he was cool and he could Ryme,So long to those days. The Crowd was chanting ""CenaSucks"" and so was i. This is How it ended. Cena wet for the F-U on Angle but Angle Reversed it into an ankle lock. Right as cena was about to tap,HBK hit an elbow of the top rope. HBK then tuned up the Van and hit Angle with a Sweat Chin Music,but Cena Swopped in and hit the F-U on HBK.

A very good match that was a bit better than expected seeing as though Mick hasn't been wrestling lately, however he hadn't lost a step and helped Carlito. However, there is only so much you can do with someone like Carlito, still very good match though.

RATING: 81/100

Batista vs. Coach

Nothing special, a few minutes and nothing much more to say. I can't make my mind up if Goldust and Vader were a plus or a minus. Disappointing indeed however.

RATING: 55/100

Eugene vs. Conway

Nothing more than bland, however, nice to see Superfly do his finisher

RATING: 55/100

Diva battle royal

Entertaining as usual but could have been a lot better if they wrestled more (gave it more time for that)

RATING: 63/100

Edge & Masters vs. Hardy & Rey

Nice match to start things off with, the drop here was the regular isolation of one face. This always kills the rating a bit especially if extensive. Great ending moves and some good tag moments.

RATING: 76/100

Cade & Murdoch vs. big show & kane

Not bad, better than expected and both teams seemed to have done their best, nice ending to a relatively good tag match

RATING: 73/100

Triple H vs. Ric Flair

A match with intense psychology, a story told, some gory moments and 5 moves from Flair! The aforementioned first 3 positives truly were positives and really made this match great, however the latter of the 4 of the matche's characteristics was a huge letdown and stopped this match from being an instant match of the year candidate. Although still up there, Flair's lack of moves and over the top use of chops killed hopes of getting this match into the high 90's. Still awesome match and well done to H'y Boy!

RATING: 90/100

Cena vs. Angle vs. Hbk

Now here was a match that was truly astounding but once again with only 1 real hindrance. The fact that Cena retained was the hindrance here as the perfect cherry on the top for this one would have been if Angle made Cena tap! Some real great moments and some high-flying from HBK got this to greatness and one of the best wwe title matches of the year.

RATING: 91/100

Two tremendous Main events and two very enjoyable gooo matches left the other four leaving something to be desired. Still a good PPV made by the final 2 matches of the night.",1132963200,,2276,4.508557457212714
2176115,2,B00068S3KU,"My Review for Taboo Tuesday 2005

Mysterio & Matt Hardy v. Chris Masters & Snitsky **1/2

Completely carried by the smackdown crew (as the entire company has been as of late). Edge tore his bicep a few days before this and obviously couldn't compete. Salvaged by Gene Snitsky, the two bigger men in Masters and Snitsky struggled to keep up with the much faster (and entertaining) Hardy and Mysterio. You can tell who the meat of the match is.

Eugene & Jimmy Snuka v. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko *1/2

Did anyone really care? A cute comedy match as is par for the course for Eugene. The rest of this is just really a waste of pay per view time. It'd have been nice if they took the 5-10 minutes of this and added it to the main event.

Mankind v. Carlito **3/4

Jesus Foley carried this. Why were these two feuding anyways? This had no direction from the get go. Foley bumped and did what he needed to do to get the match over and did so adequetely, but the rest of this is just plain flat.

World Tag Team Championship

Cade & Murdoch v. Kane & Big Show *3/4

Awful, slow, bad, atrocious, whatever. The big men have the tag titles again and AGAIN, they're being used to be the catalyst for a feud and the end of their reign. And again, it's all at the expense of one of the only legit teams on the brand.

Street Fight

Batista v. The Coach DUD

Austin took his ball and ran. Batista was left to pick up the pieces, but no one really cared. Garbage.

Fulfill Your Fantasy DIVA battle Royal

Trish v. Victoria v. Mickie James v. Canidice v. Ashley **

Chicks in nothing again. Once the action widdled down to Trish, Victoria and Mickie James (alexis larrie), it got very good actually. Again, the women are picking up the slack big time here. Probobly the seeds of the Larrie-Stratus feud being planted here.

Steel Cage Match

Ric Flair v. Triple H ***3/4

This match is proof that you don't have to fling yourself off a building to put on a good gimmick match. The psychology and everything was there. The two worked within each other and made this match really mean something. You know you're seeing a good feud when you're two months in and have the feeling that it's just getting started. Great work from both.

WWE Championship-- Triple Threat Match

John Cena v. Kurt Angle v. Shawn Michaels ***1/2

Another quality match but was about five to ten minutes too short. Most of this is Angle and HBK working against each other but it makes for some entertaining mat work. The ending was fantastic with everything big being hit only once and not done over and over again. Everything maintained it's effect and delievered.

Overall D: If it wasn't for the last two matches, this would be a waste of time and money. There's really nothing to say other than that. Flair-Triple H is a low end MOTY candidate and Cena-HBK-Angle is a strong title match. Other than that, don't even bother.",1132876800,,2883,4.430740037950664

2176164,4,B00068S3KU,"first lets get to the ppv taboo Tuesday 2005,its a very good show but it does has a few disappointments.

1)interbrand tag team match SD)rey mysterio and matt hardy vs snitsky and Chris masters.

a great opener with fast pace action and some good high flying,athletic moves I like more way more than sd but I was pulling for smackdown in this one because snitsky and masters are just unimpressive wrestlers that have failed to make there mark so far in the corporation. 8/10

2)Eugene and snuka vs rob Conway

ok match but made better when we got to see all three of the legends instead of just one. 5/10

3)Mankind vs Carlito

good match with some classic manoeuvres from mankind but arhhhh why couldn't this be a hardcore match it would have been so much better but anyway its a good match little short but mankind wins when he pulls out mr socko with a Carlito hair style on it nice little touch there. 8/10

4)kane and big show vs lance cade and chris murdoch(C)

nice to see a title change as I see kane and big show  as a unstoppable duo.good match as I especially like kane and big shows double choke slam.but I do miss Kane as a monster because it gave raw a bit of un-expectency and spark hardcore action which wwe is missing as you will see in the street  fight below.  anyway good tag team action. 7/10

5)batista vs coach with goldust and vader.

before I review this eeeerm ...god knows what I would like to say why wasn't Austin here, I heard it was a accident if anyone could you tell me. anyway this match was bad very bad as I was expecting so much more and why does everybody think batista is that good one spinebuster and its like the match is over.and the batista bomb is just a sat down powerbomb it isn't that good.

2/10

6)woman's diva battle royal

ok sort of bad match but it is woman's so I was not expecting that much anyway 3/10

7)now here is what I was talking about hardcore action fantastic bloodbath just which hhh put some weapons in the ring before the match started but still extremely brutal. flair was bleeding so much his hair went red  hhh started to see red as well later on in the  match. some  nice smashes into the cage mesh as well great to see flair win as I wasn't expecting it I would like to see more of this in the wwe. 10/10

8) triple threat match wwe championship on the line hbk vs cena vs angle.

I like cena but I want to see some one have the title now because I'm getting a little tired of these long title reigns that never seem to end. anyway great match good announce table spot when hbk and angle got cena up for a double suplex but threw him belly first through the table nice to see something different there.good technical wrestling blended with good all round action great match 9/10

taboo Tuesday 2005 was a good ppv but good have slightly better I would recommend it.

MATCH 2: Rob Conway + Tyson Tomko Vs Eugene + ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka - 5/10

MATCH 3: Carlito Vs Mankind - 8/10

MATCH 4: WORLD TAG TEAM TITLES - Lance Cade + Trevor Murdoch Vs The Big Show + Kane - 6/10

Decent match.

MATCH 5: STREET FIGHT - Jonathan Cocahman Vs Batista - 2/10

This match was crap and very short.

MATCH 6: BATTLE ROYAL - WOMENS TITLE - 5/10

Not a bad match, the final elimination was a bit weird though.

2176166,4,B00068S3KU,"First of all something that will help the Ross situation was that Joey Styles was at Taboo Tuesday as the lead announcer. I am glad too because you could tell the coach was nervous as the job.

1. Chris Masters and Gene Snitsky vs Matt Hardy and Rey Mysterio- Wow great opener! very fast paced action and a lot of hard hitting. Wow SD has won again. I don't mind SD winning unless they win the SS series match because Raw is the superior brand. 8.5/10

2 Rob Conway and Tomko vs Eugene and Snuka- This was boring. I am glad the fans voted Snuka. Why was Tomko in this match? That decision was made on the Raw the night before. 5/10

3. Mankind vs Carlito- Man i wish this was a hardcore match. It was still great but it would be cool because we know what Mankind is capable of. Some nice outside action. Match could've went a little longer but it was still a great match. 8/10

4. Kane and Big Show vs Cade and Murdock- Kane and Big Show become the new tag team champions! Cade and Murdock were only champs for a month. That is too bad because I saw some potential in them. Kane and Big Show are going to be unstoppable! Good match and a lot of dominance by Kane and Show. 7/10

5. Coach vs Batista- Dissapoiting because it was a street fight and only 2 weapons were used. The belt and kendo stick were used. Batista also messed up on the spinebuster on Vader. This match could've went longer. Not too bad but expected a lot more. 5/10

6. Fufill your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal. This match was actually solid and better than Coach vs Batista. I wasn't paying too much attention to the match though. Lingerie! Yay!

7. Triple H vs Ric Flair- Talk about bloodbath. Ric Flair was bleeding completely on his face and hair. Somewhat suprised that Ric Flair won. Great Match but not better than Matt Hardy and Edge from Unforgiven. 9/10

8. Triple Threat Match- Man I am so tired of Cena as champ. Kurt and Shawn deserve it more. They give 110 percent every night and they get no reward for it. Anyway Best Match of the Night. I was pulling for Shawn but I didn't mind if Kurt won. Anybody but Cena. Match of the Year contender. 10/10",1130889600,,2128,4.26302729528536
2176167,3,B00068S3KU,"This was my second ppv I've been to (the first being Vengeance 01 when it came here) and I gotta say, it was a fun night. However, the show was solid thanks to the final 2 matches. The electricity was there for a few matches, but it didn't feel the same as compared to Vengeance 01. However, it was still fun.

Joey Styles making his WWE debut was awesome. Of course, I expected it since I keep up with my wrestling news online ;)

Heat Match: Kerwin White and Matt Striker vs Shelton Benjamin and Val Venis. Dude, this was WAY TOO SHORT! But then again that is WWE for you. Match had some decent potential, but at only about 3 minutes, it's hard to really put on a good match. Lame finish too btw. (1/5)

PPV Matches:

Chris Masters and Snitsky vs Hardy and Rey Mysterio. I was bummed that there was no Christian as this was his last night with the company. Would've been nice, but oh well, maybe I'll see him at PWG shows. Edge of course had to pull himself out of this due to a legit (I believe knee) injury. So we get Snitsky instead, oy vey. However, it was surprisingly decent! Fun match and a good way to start the show. (3/5 stars)

Rob Conway and Tomko vs Snuka (NOT SNOOKA) and Eugene. I voted for Snuka and we still got to see Duggan and Kamala nail their finishers afterwards. Man, I felt like a kid again with the legends making appearances. As a match, nothing special. Snuka had a hard time positioning himself on the top rope (I was in the third row behind that post he was on) and I almost thought he would botch it, but thank god he didn't. Nothing match, but it was all in good fun. (1/5)

Mankind vs Carlito. I voted for Cactus, so I was bummed here. However, Mick Foley is still one of the greatest ever and he CARRIED THIS MATCH! Carlito is ok, but he needs to develop a moveset and NOT REST IN MATCHES ALL THE TIME! This was all Foley showing off his stuff. (2/5)

Big Show and Kane vs Trevor Murdoch and Lance Cade. I voted for HBK in the main event and I, along with TONS of others, got our wish. Standard formula match with the champs bumping around for the big stiffs. Not that I didn't mind the match, but it felt like a modern day Natural Disasters vs Beverly Brothers match to me. Still, it was ok for what it was. (1/5)

Batista vs Coach in a Street Fight (which just about all of us voted for). Eh, it was ok for the few minutes as Goldust and Vader were in it. However, it was like a Superstars main event, that being a short match with the workers going through the usual motions. Vader was out of shape and he no-sold several moves to tick us off. Goldust is still a decent worker and Coach is Coach. Austin made the right decision in walking out on the company because HE WAS GOING TO JOB TO COACH! More time and more brawling would've made this slightly more entertaining than it was. (1/5)

Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal (lingerie). I wanted Leather and Lace, but Lingerie is fine by me. NICE eye candy live at the show. Man, it was hard to concentrate on the actual match as the women were bangable ;)(No Rating)

Cage Match: Ric Flair vs Triple H. This was FUN! The show had been dragging and this saved the show! Plus this was special to me because I am a huge Flair fan dating back to my childhood and I have always wanted to see my favorite gimmick match live. Lots of great emotion, blood, loud chops, and great heat from the crowd. Definite match of the night! (4/5)

Cena vs Angle vs Michaels. Man and from one fun match to another! Just fun brawling and great wrestling. Oh btw, CENA SUCKS! Myself and the majority of the section I was in were chanting ""CENA SUCKS"" and booing his every move. Why does he suck? HE CAN'T WORK A MATCH! GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEADS! Now you ask ""But you said this was good!"" It was good because the formula was right: PUT CENA IN MATCHES WITH WRESTLERS THAT MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD! It worked for Demolition in the late 80s and 1990 and it can work for Cena. Cena needs to be a heel again because that's when his raps were truly badass and he was actually cool. Now that he is a face, he SUCKS as his raps kiss up to the crowd. I give him credit as he is OVER (or popular) with the crowd. If his in-ring work improves, I will grow to appreciate him a little more. But for now, he is not that great in my book. If he was great, he would carry Snitsky to a fun lumberjack match on Raw. BUT HE DIDN'T! Anyways, enough of that. This was the Second best match of the night. (4/5)

So it was like 1998 WWF to me. Decent beginning, slow middle, and then red-hot ending. Worth getting for the final 2 matches alone and if you like wrestling nostalgia (like myself) GET THIS!",1130889600,,4647,4.185682326621924

Raw vs. Smackdown
Matt Hardy and Rey [Smackdown] vs. Chris Masters and Snitsky:

Nice way to start off the show. I really love the brand rivalry and this was one of the best matches of the night. Rey and Hardy used a lot of speed and high flying to combat the power of Masters and Snitsky. Edge wouldn't wrestle because he was injured. Rey and Hardy won after a 619, and a Twist of Fate, and a springboard splash. 8.5/10

Rob Conway and Tyson Tomko vs. Eugene and Superfly Snooka:

Okay match, nice to see Superfly wrestle again, even if it was short. Short and just put on to take up time and Eugene and Superfly win. 5.5/10

Carlito vs. Mankind:

Yes, Mankind returns!!! Short match, I expected Cactus Jack to win. Mankind went to use a chair but Carlito dropped toed him into the steel steps face first, a funny moment took place later when Mankind took out Mr. Socko and it had an afro on it! 8/10

World Tag Team Championships
Lance Cade and Trevor Murdock [Champions] vs. Kane and Big Show:

I remember when Kane and Big Show tried to become champs all the way back in 2001. Anyway this was okay, and even though there are rumors going around that Kane suffered a back injury, he looked okay tonight. Short match, mostly big man powermoves by the two 7 foot men, and Kane and Big Show win after a double chokeslam on Cade. 7.5/10

Street Fight
Batista vs. The Coach:

Verbal debate my a**, who ever voted for that should be shot. 91% of you people at least have a brain. This was short and now that Steve Austin isn't here anymore Batista was left to fill in. Nice to see Vader and Goldust back again, but this was a big letdown. Not even a trickle of blood and it ends in like, 8 mintues. Batista wins. 2/10

Women's Championship
Battle Royal [Lingerie]
Trish Stratus [Champion] vs. Mickie James vs. Ashley vs. Victoria vs. Candice:

Wow, does Trish look good or what? That black and green peice was excellent! Okay match, but the main reason this was great is that all the women are in their lingerie! Trish wins and still holds on to her championship. 9/10 [For the outfits!]

Intercontinental Championship
Steel Cage Match
Ric Flair [Champion] vs. Triple H:

When was the last time Triple H was IC Champ? 2002 I believe. This was an intense match with a lot of blood and steel chairshots being used near the end. Both men work soo well together, I hope they have a rematch at Survivor Series. Triple H even pulls out a chain from somewhere and uses it against Flair. The end comes when Flair uses a steel chair on Triple h for the win. 9/10 Bloody and the best match of the night, well worth it.

Triple Threat Match
Kurt Angle vs. John Cena [Champion] vs. Shawn Michales:

Dammit, when is Cena gonna lose that title? I understand Vince sees a money making future with him, but Angle or HBK deserve a run again! This was a fantastic match by the way, knew it would be. Lots of chain wrestling and high risk moves by all men, especially HBK.

Best moment was when all three men were by the announce table and Angle and HBK give Cena a double suplex onto the table! Angle and HBK then fight and some highlights include Angle giving a HUGE angle slam to HBK off the top rope! The match continues and Angle applies the ankle lock to Cena. HBK lands an elbow drop then Cena hits an FU onto HBK for the win. 9/10

This is well worth it when it comes out on DVD. The steel cage match, the return of Mankind and Joey Styles, the Triple Threat Match, and seeing half a dozen hot women in Lingerie are all the reasons why you should buy this DVD!",1130803200,6,3762,4.35
2176170,5,B00068S3KU,"WWE Championship- John Cena(C) vs. Kurt Angle vs. HBK
HBK will be in this match even though I would like to see Kane but it will entertaining because Angle has classics with HBK and Cena. Cena will be carried by these two hallfamers. I wish we could see a title change here but there is a 2% chance of that happening.
Prediction: John Cena

Intercontinental Championship- Ric Flair(C) vs. HHH
This is a tough one to pick because this fued has nothing to do with the title.  It will be a steel cage match with HHH dominating but not picking up the win.
Prediction: Ric Flair

Women's Championship- Battle Royale
Prediction: Trish retains until S.S.

Tag Team Championship- Cade and Murdoch(C) vs. Kane and Big Show
This is a tough one to call because you know there will be a fued between Show and Kane while they would still make great champs.  I say they take the titles to mix up this division but they'll lose them soon on RAW. (Before Survivor Series)
Prediction: Kane and Big Show

Carlito vs. Mick Foley
This will be a great fued between my two favorite personalities in the WWE. Expect Carlito to lose so he can after the intercontental and Foley can move on
Prediction: Mankind

Tomko and Conway vs. Eugene and a legend
Prediction: Snuka and Eugene go over as fan favorites

Edge and Masters vs. 2 smackdown wrestlers
This one I am looking forward to as I hope JBL and Christian are in this match.  It should be a classic match setting up an epic fued.

Diva Battle Royal

My Vote - Schoolgirl outfits

World Tag Team Championships

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Coach

Edge & Chris Masters vs. Two SmackDown! Superstars

My Vote - Matt Hardy & Rey Mysterio

This is gonna be good! Two cruiserweights will be high-flyin'

Ric Flair vs. Triple H

My Vote - Steel Cage Match

It is better than last years steel cage match. It will suck if its is one on one match it will more suck if it is a submission match. This is brutal if it is Steel cage match. Lots of bloodbath.

WWE Championship

My Vote - HBK

a)Submition match

b)falls count anywere

c)30 m iron man match

I hope this his the 2 choice. Anyway this will go on after this one, but the matches between these two are always good and this one should be no exception.

MY CHOICE:JOHN CENA (maybe Angle wins the title in SS)

INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP:

RIC FLAIR(c) v TRIPLE H

a)No DQ

b)Street fight

c)Steel cage

Triple H is going to have to carry the match but it will be fun to see. Flair will come with some trick to get the win but the feud will go on.

MY CHOICE:RIC FLAIR

ITEN ON A POLE MATCH:

BIG SHOW v EDGE

a)chair

b)lead pipe

c)money in the bank case

These two are scheduled to face each other. Snitsky and Lita will interfere and give Edge the victory. Edge is scheduled to fight for the title so the WWE need's to make in a viable threat.

MY CHOICE: EDGE

N1 CONTENDER MATCH FOR THE WWE TITLE

HBK v CARLITO

a)lumberjack

b)normal

c)strap match

Lots of funny stuff and good moves. Something happens later and neither of the two wins so Kurt Angle remains the n1 contender.

MY CHOICE: DOUBLE DQ

WORLD TAG TEAMS TITLE:

CADE & MURDOCH(c) v

a)HURRICANE & ROSEY

b)HEARTHROBS

c)VAL VENIS & BIG VIS

2176222,4,B00068S3KU,"Hello and welcome to my review on Summerslam 2002. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- =0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  =8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Intercontinental Championship-Chris""Y2J""Jericho(C)Vs Shelton Benjamin-I was surprised Shelton got picked here even though he's a phenomenal athlete it just didn't seem a good pick for this match, especially considering it was a face Vs face for the opener which made it a little less good as there was no heel turns, but after the match ended there was some great sportsmanship between the men. If I was to pick who I wanted to face Y2J it would have been Steven Richards as he has been wrestling for so long yet never got any major gold except the now defunct Hardcore title and he has a great ethic for the business and he just deserves a chance. Onto the match itself was pretty ordinary compared to what I was expecting the ending was a little unique except it was stop then hit the move rather then one motion still a average match to start this show. My rating 7.75/10.

Match Two-School Girl Battle Royal-Womens Title-Trish Stratus(C)Vs Molly Holly Vs Jazz Vs Stacy Keibler Vs Nidia Vs Victoria-This was a nice little short match with it being like any mans Battle Royal except for you can be eliminated by going through the ropes as well as over them. There was some good work made by the ladies and the all round performance was good. I hope they have more matches for the ladies in the future which create excitement rather then be a filler. My rating 6.21/10.

Match Three-Chain Match-Gene Snitsky Vs Kane-This was a very good match in my opinion, Kane sold and worked so hard like a true champ should do and Snitsky well he might not be the greatest wrestler in the ring but he has a little bit of talent which is useful. There was a bit of blood from Kane especially his throat. The ending was very good as it told the story and when we thought this was the end of their rivalry there was a post match attack and someone got stretchered out. My rating 8.01/10.

Match Four-Hair Vs Hair Match-Eugene Vs Eric Bischoff-This was a nice match with the great stipulation of Hair Vs Hair. Eugene looked like he was having lots of fun out there and thats good for him as he's doing what he wants to. Eric nailed some nasty kicks in this match and Eugene did some of his famous other wrestlers moves. The match itself was a long way to short and it didn't provide enough emotion which puts it down a little bit. My rating 7.15/10.

Match Five-World Tag Team Championships-La Resistance(C)Vs Edge & Chris Benoit-Benoit & Edge received this match as they were not chosen for the World Heavyweight Championship match later in the evening. Rob Conway is starting to really improve in the ring and the same has to be said for Sylvan Grenier as well. Edge and Benoit put on a clinic especially Benoit but then Edge walked out for some reason. My rating 7.26/10.

Match Six-Lingerie Pillow Fight-Carmella DeCesare Vs Christy Hemme-This match was a waste of time it was under two minutes and it had no purpose it was between the ""physcho whose not a physcho"" and the one with no personality. Why did they have to have this match its putting a dampener on this nice event. My rating 2.49/10.

Match Seven-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels-HBK was legit hurt for this match but he still toughed it out once more for his fans. This was definetly not their greatest match but they did their best considering Shawns injury and that they didn't know who they were versing for the event and that. Good effort with a great ending setting up a great future feud. My rating 7.53/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-Cage Match-Ric Flair Vs Randy Orton-This was a awesome match except it was way to short and it should have been a submission match anyway. There was quite a bit of blood in this one and it did a very good ending in it as well. Great action and some good spots in this made it very enjoyable. After the match these two hugged, maybe a Ric Flair face turn? Nope cause the next night he came out with Evolution costing Orton a shot for the title at Survivor Series. My rating 8.72/10.

This show was fairly good with the Chain,Cage and the Tag Title match being the main stand outs with the HBK Vs HHH match being not to far behind them. The score for this show was 55.12/80 which is 68.90% which is a B-. Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested. I believe this should be added to your collection as it is a very novel event.",1120953600,,5787,4.473734479465138

TABOO TUESDAY 2004:

Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho: 7.5/10

Nothing amazing about this match. Their encounter at Backlash 2005 is far better. Not a bad opener to the PPV but the sad thing is that this match is a serious contender for the best match of the night.

Trish Stratus vs. Victoria vs. Nidia vs. Stacy Kiebler vs. Gail Kim vs. Jazz vs. Molly Holly: 2/10

This was a waste of time done only so we could see them in school girl outfits. Fast forward this.

Gene Snitsky vs. Kane: 5/10

A very boring and disappointing chain match. There are no innovative moves done with the chain, just weak shots by both men. This truly fails to impress.

Eugene vs. Eric Bischoff: 3/10

Horrible 'match', the only reason it gets a 3 is because Bischoff getting his head shaved and the appearance of Mr. McMahon is mildly entertaining.

Chris Benoit & Edge vs. La Resistance: 6.5/10

A terribly average tag team match. We've seen way better matches on television. Edge walks off and leaves another bad match on the card.

Lingerie pillow fight:

Christy vs. Carmella: 2/10

Two women's matches in one night? That is a VERY bad idea. Thought the school girl match was horrible? This is even worse and even more boring. Over half the match is the women behind a curtain dressing. What a waste of time.

Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels: 7/10

I thought this would be a great match. I was wrong. HBK sells his 'injury' for the whole match. This makes the match slow-paced and by no means exciting. Finally we get a burst of energy from HBK at the end that somewhat adds a bit of excitement. This is the worst of all their encounters, please check out any of the others and give this one a skip.

Steel Cage Match:

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair: 7.5/10

Not a bad match but disappointing as far as cage matches go. The cage is not used very well, for example there are no moves performed with the cage or off the top of the cage. Very bloody and has a lot of emotion put into it by both men. 7.5 is a generous rating.

SCORE: 40.5/80 (51/100)

According to the key I have rated Taboo Tuesday 2004 as 'Fair', an average PPV and that it is worth a look but not your money.

Also it only barely fits in to this rating. I somewhat agree with this. Taboo Tuesday was a bad PPV and one that I don't want to see again, I have no desire to see any of those matches ever again.

SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated CHRIS JERICHO to Win the InterContinental Title: Benjamin surprisingly got 37% of the vote. Terrible choice as opener. Face vs face matches need a build up & a reason to occur. This bout had neither & because of that, I found it hard to care a great deal. Furthermore, there had been recent hints that Jericho was stepping up to the main event, so it was fairly predictable that he would lose the title, no matter who the opponent was. The match itself was solid, but extremely unspectacular. In fact, it almost looked as if it was completely impromptu. It eventually got going right near the end, but then it ended. Both performers are talented, but this was average, if watchable, stuff. Shelton wins the title at the 11 minute mark with a t-bone type of power slam. I actually preferred the Raw rematch to this. Now onto my quest to find those few people that voted for Rodney Mack!!! Match Rating...6

TRISH STRATUS Won a Schoolgirl Battle Royal to Retain the WWE Women's Title: A little bit different, I suppose. But still nothing special. More of a 'here are our 7 Raw female wrestlers in schoolgirl uniforms', than an actual match. Ironic that the next #1 contender for the title was not in this group. Probably the best decision to keep the title on Trish for now, although the ending should have been a little more engrossing than it ended up being. Six minutes worth was about right. Match Rating...5

GENE SNITSKY defeated KANE in a Steel Chain Match: This big man match was a lot better than I expected it to be. While Kane sold magnificently, I'm going on record that Snitsky actually showed some sort of potential for a rookie. Even bout with decent intensity & ok action. Fourteen minutes was slightly too long, but these 2 filled it out fairly well. I'm a little confused as to the ruling that allowed the chair as a weapon in a chain match, but this is the WWE. Snitsky wins after Pillmanizing Kane's neck with a chair. The usual internal bleeding & gurney attack follows. Would have received a higher rating had Snitsky not been a little too careful with some of his chain shots & punches. However, it has to be taken into account that this guy has been in the WWE for less than 2 months & this was quite an ask for him. Match Rating...6

EUGENE defeated ERIC BISCHOFF in a Hair vs Hair Match: Scarily enough, I've seen enough Bischoff wrestling matches to state that this was a usual Bischoff match. Basically a 2 minute squash to get Bischoff's head shaved. Coach came out to try & save Eric, but then Vince made his predictable appearance on behalf of the fans. At this stage, there had been nothing worthwhile to come from all of this, but then Bischoff & Coachman made the whole thing click & the fans ate it up. Seriously, the 2 heels acted their parts perfectly. There were even some funny lines thrown in for good measure. I've been generous with the rating & it definitely wasn't for the match. Match/Segment Rating...5

CHRIS BENOIT & EDGE defeated LA RESISTANCE to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: Grenier actually got through the entire Canadian national anthem, which is a bit of a blight on this event in itself. Do you think the fans voted for that!?!?!? The first 5 minutes of this bout was actually quite good & heading toward a 7 rating. Benoit & Edge were on the same page & dominating offense, while Grenier & Conway were keeping up well. Even Edge's jawing with the fans was well done, both from a match & angle perspective. But then Grenier put on his patented yawn-inducing headlock & the match deteriorated (well before Edge left the scene). The heels dominated from then on with predominantly boring offense. When Edge walked out after the referee didn't see him tagged in, Benoit went on to win the match by himself. I hate it when one man wins the tag titles without a partner. Way too long at 16 minutes (excluding anthem)!!! Match Rating...5

CHRISTY defeated CARMELLA in a Lingerie Pillow Fight: Taking up about 7 minutes in total (3 of which were watching silhouettes of the 2 ladies undress & then dress), this was most definitely a waste of time. Carmella simply should not be on live television. Christy won by pinfall when I think Carmella choked on the 4 million feathers that were in the ring. Match/Segment Rating...2

TRIPLE H defeated SHAWN MICHAELS to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: Even JR & King seemed surprised when Triple H's music started & this was not the main event. HBK heavily sold his knee injury from the night before. Michaels always over sells, but in this case it was warranted due to that injury & Triple H's targetting of it. Unfortunately, having the first 10 minutes of this 14 minute bout solely consisting of Triple H attacking HBK's knee was a bit too much for my liking. The eventual HBK comeback occurred & he even managed to hit sweet chin music. But then the predictable Edge spear resulted in the champ retaining. Flair vs Savage, this definitely was not, but it did tell a decent enough story & could lead to a few angles. Unfortunately, while HBK's desire to overcome injury gives the belt more credence, Triple H's struggling & interference-based victory over a virtual cripple more than negates that. Difficult to rate. I can't fail it, but as an individual match, I can't do much more either. Match Rating...5

RANDY ORTON defeated RIC FLAIR in a Steel Cage Match: I wasn't at all surprised to see the cage match choice receive 68% of the vote. More than passable with the usual lashings of blood. Entertaining throughout & what I especially liked was that it wasn't as repetitive as some of Flair's recent bouts (cage or no cage). One of the reasons for that was the short duration of the match, and at only 10 minutes, that cannot be ignored. I can see why this was made the main event, but an extra 5 minutes wouldn't have hurt. Match of the night. Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (41/80) = 51

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'Taboo Tuesday' a 'D' grade & said that it was 'mediocre & disappointing'. I won't say that the word 'disappointing' is apt here, because I wasn't expecting much better. But 'mediocre' hits the nail on the head. Wild & inconsistent. Lucky not to fail in some ways, but unlucky not to rate higher in others. I think the main concern here is that the 2 main events lasted 24 minutes between them, while the tag title match + the Kane vs Snitsky match lasted 30 minutes between them. I'm all for increasing midcard time, but the priorities were not correct there.

I hated the idea of a face vs face opener, while having 2 women's matches on a ppv is always a recipe for disaster. The big question out of the event though was should HBK have wrestled. That's a tough one that requires more thinking on my behalf to answer. Overall, I opened my mind to this event & forgot my low expectations (a vacation helped), but it still did not deliver.",1114732800,,7459,4.557879014189694

Eric Bischoff lost the match, nearly lost his job and then officially lost his hair.

It didn't take long for Eugene to punish his uncle and RAW General Manager with a convincing win, capped by Hollywood Hogan-esque leg drop.

It was soon revealed that WWE fans decided the loser would have his head shaved by the winner. But with the prospects of Bischoff losing his beloved hair staring him in the face, Coach stepped in and decided the choice of the fans wouldn't be honored.

That didn't go over too well with Mr. McMahon, who came to the ring and demanded Bischoff take his haircut like a man. Moreover, Coach was ordered to wear a dress for his trouble as GM and assistant left Milwaukee a quite humiliated duo.

Since Shawn Michaels was selected by the fans to take on Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge and Chris Benoit had to settle for facing La Resistance.

But the consolation prize didn't go over too well with Edge, who brooded over the choice of the fans all night and ultimately walked out on the match and actually jumped in his car outside the arena, leaving Benoit to fend for himself.

But the Rabid Wolverine mounted a fierce comeback, eventually applying the Crippler Crossface on Rob Conway, who tapped out after he couldn't get to the ropes.

Kane vs. Snitsky

It appears Kane will have to wait to get his ultimate revenge on Gene Snitsky.

In a bloody and hard-fought Weapons of Choice Match, the uncaring newcomer used a chain and steel chair to leave Kane in a stretcher as Lita watched in horror.

WWE fans selected the chain as the weapon of choice, but Snitsky did most of his damage with the chair, securing it around Kane's neck before jumping on it, crushing the throat of the Big Red Monster.

But Snitsky wasn't done. As Kane was being escorted out, Snitsky kicked the stretcher, sending Kane face-first onto the metal ramp.

Intercontinental Championship

It's all about the Benjamin.

After taking 37 percent of the vote, Shelton Benjamin certainly didn't disappoint his fans, defeating seven-time

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho at Taboo Tuesday in Milwaukee.

Benjamin dictated much of the action, connecting with a superplex from the top turnbuckle and hitting a flying clothesline on Jericho. He even escaped the Walls of Jericho during the match.

The lack of preparation time for Jericho may have cost him in the end as Benjamin converted his T-Bone Suplex to get the three-count and the championship.

It certainly didn't take long for WWE fans to have an impact as a championship changed hands on the very first match of Taboo Tuesday.

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair

There's no argument now, Randy Orton is indeed a Legend Killer.

In a Steel Cage of all places, Orton avoided a chair shot and then connected with the RKO to pin Flair at Taboo Tuesday.

Both Superstars were covered in blood by the time the historic match ended. WWE fans decided the match would take place in a Steel Cage instead of a Submission or Falls Count Anywhere Match.

Orton showed Flair the ultimate respect after the match, shaking Flair's hand and hugging the 16-time former World Champion.

Final voting results:

Steel Cage 68%

Falls Count Anywhere 20%

Submission Match 12%

World Heavyweight Championship

It would have been one of the most remarkable victories in Shawn Michaels' career.

Battling a serious knee injury, the fans' choice to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship never succumbed to the pain, battling The Game with one good leg and a giant heart.

But before HBK could put Triple H away with Sweet Chin Music, Edge, who had previously walked out on his tag team match with Chris Benoit and seemingly left the arena, suddenly reappeared and speared the Showstopper, helping Triple H retain his championship.

Edge, still furious after losing his shot at glory, muttered over and over ""It should have been me,"" as he left the ring.

Final voting results:

HBK 38.72%

Benoit 27.86%

Only like 2 or 3 of my votes won but I think it turned out pretty good.  his event was supposed to change WWE but it seemed like your usual event.

Opening Match:

1. Intercontinental Championship Match

Chris Jericho (c) vs Shelton Benjamin

I voted for Rhyno in this category but he didn't even get but like 4% if that much.  Really good match with Benjamin winning following a T-Bone Suplex. 7.5/10

2. Something,something Battle Royal for the Womens Title.

Trish Stratus (c),Victoria,Stacy Kiebler,Molly,and some more Divas.

Trish wins and retains her Title. 2/10

3. Steel Chain Match

Kane vs Gene Snitsky

I voted on the Chain to be the weapon.  Snitsky wins after using a Chair to crush Kanes throat followed by the 1-2-3.6/10

4. Loser gets head shaved Match

Eugene vs Eric Bischoff

I voted for the loser to have to be the servant for the winner.  Eugene wins following a Hogan Legdrop.  The segment afterwards with Vince McMahon,Coach,Bischoff,and Eugene is unbeleivably funny.

5. World Tag Team Championship Match

Rob Conway and Sylvan Grenier (c)s vs Chris Benoit and Edge

Good match with Edge walking out on Benoit however Benoit still manages to force conway to tap out to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Tag Team Titles. 7/10

6. Lingerie Pillow fight Match

Christy Hemme vs Carmella

My favorite part was watching Christy in her Lingerie.....Oh BABY!!!!!  Christy wins. 1/10

7. World Heavyweight Championship Match

Triple H (c) vs Shaen Michaels

This was the 5th time these two met on P-P-V in 2004.  Very good match considering HBKs injury.  H3 wins after Edge intrferes and Spears Michaels who is shortly covered by H3 for the 3.  I voted for Benoit on this one. 8/10

8. Steel Cage Match

Ric Flair vs Randy Orton

I voted for this match to be inside the Cage.  This should have not been the main-event.  Orton wins after a RKO.6.5/10",1110844800,,1913,4.79320987654321

Watching PPV's aren't worth it, because you know who was going win. Raw had a few bright ideas like Rooster Trading and Spin The Wheel. Rooster Trading failed miserably considering Triple H got picked by Smackdown but Raw got him back trading back 4 excellent talents including my personal faviorte wrestler RVD. Ever since RVD left, Raw is limp. I don't get to see Smackdown because I don't have the channel, but when I do its a big relief. TNA was fresh for a week and then got stale. The ring is cool but Jeff Jarrett is like Triple H, and has held onto the belt without even wrestling on the new TV show. Anther major problem with Raw is they have PPV quailty matchs every week so buying a PPV seems like paying to watch Raw. This was anther fresh idea from Raw that sounded cool and feel flat. Sure you picked the matchs and rules, but everything turned out as predicted. I haven't watched a full Raw for almost 2 years; Its stale, boring, and predictable. They don't use the talent they have, just show PPV quailty guys on each and every Raw wrestling week in and week out. On a final not, Royal Rumble 2005 was suppose to single the Road To Wrestlemaina, but I knew who was going win. I wanted Orton to win, but I knew Triple H would retain his title.

2176293,3,B00068S3KU,"This is easily the worst wwe ppv of the year. It has four decent matches but nothing special at all. This is a new low for the WWE and they better start picking it up. Before I get to the match reviews WHAT THE HELL IS WWE DOING. There have been 10 cuts/firings to decent superstars in 48 hours and it,s wrecking the buisness. There is a rumour going around that WWE will stop the brand extention(two seperate rosters)and they should as talent is getting fewer and fewer every day. This is the only good news coming from the firings. I had to get that off my head but any way here is how I rate the matches.

RATING SCALE

40 Bad PPV

40-50 Okay PPV

50-60 Average PPV

60-70 Good PPV

70-80 Exellent PPV

80+ Classic PPV

Intercontinental Championship

Chris Jericho(c) vs. Shelton Benjamin

Im glad Benjamin got the title shot but I didn't wan't him to win it. Benjamin is a great wrestler but Jericho only just won it 2 months ago and was doing a great job with the belt. As for the match it self was one of the decent matches of the night. It was very short but had explosive action all the way through and many nice moves used by both men. Benjamin gets the three count after an exploder suplex and wins the Intercontinental Championship. WINNER-Shelton Benjamin 7/10

Womans Championship-Fantasy Battle Royal

Trish Stratus(c) vs. Stacy vs. Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Nidia vs. Jazz vs. Molly Holly

All the ladys looked HOT!!!!!!! in this match but the match itself was short and worthless as Trish retains anyway. If you get this DVD just press skip after the ladys entrances.

WINNER-Trish Stratus 4/10

Steel Chain Match

Kane vs. Gene Snitsky

Snitsky is starting to remind me of Kane(a monster) and he was in a match one on one with him here. A brutal match with the chain used numerous times but was slow and boring which was hard to watch. Snitsky wins it in the end.

WINNER-Gene Snitsky 5/10

Loser gets their head shaved

Eugene vs. Eric Biscoff

A squash match. Only 2 minutes long with Eugene winning after hitting a Hogan leg drop. The Aftermath was funny though when Eric gets shaves(He's really grey) and coach is forced to wear a dress by Mr McMahon. WINNER-Eugene 5/10

World Tag Team Titles

La Resistance(c) vs. Edge/Chris Benoit

Probably the fourth best match of the night. This seemed like one of those main event Raw matches that they have every night on Raw but was still good. Edge walks out on Benoit making his heel turn official but Benoit still wins the titles making one of the french guys tap out with the crossface. La Resistance get the titles back two weeks later on Raw so I don't know what the point of this was. WINNER-Benoit/Edge 6/10

Lingerie Match

Christy vs. Carmella

Not even worth my time. Boring!!!!!!!!

WINNER-Christy 0/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H(c) vs. Shawn Michaels

What a performance by HBK injured but Triple H really pulled this match down with his working on the injury tatics. Lots of exciting points in this match especially when Shawn hit Sweet chin music but Edge costs him the title delivering a devastating spear to Michaels. Triple H covered to pick up the win and retain the belt. WINNER-Triple H 8/10

Steel Cage match

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair

Best match of the night and was a good, brutal cage match. Both men put in a great effort and took some bumps. Not a classic but still a good main event to finish Taboo Tuesday. Randy Orton wins after hitting an RKO out of nowhere on Flair. WINNER-Randy Orton 8.5/10

Overall a poor performance by WWE. Hopefully the brand extention will end and we will get the old WWE back. Overall Taboo Tuesday scored a 43.5/80. RATING SCALE-54",1099526400,3,3668,4.565084226646248

Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho - Intercontinental Championship

Match was pretty fast-paced, and action wise it was all there. Some pretty cool-looking moves from each of the contestants. Shelton catches Y2J with a T-Bone suplex to win his first RAW championship. ***1/2

Diva Battle Royal - Women's Championship - School Girl Outfits

WOW! Trish was looking so hot it wasn't even funny. Match was pretty boring and fast. All the contestants were looking really hot. *** Because of the ladies.

Kane vs. Gene Snitsky - Steel Chain Match

Not a horrible match, not a fantastic match either. Snitsky's being portrayed as the next ""unstoppable force"". Although the whole babykilling storyline belongs on ""As The World Turns"". WWE stick to wrestling storylines please **1/2

Eugene vs. Eric Bischoff - Loser Gets His Head Shaved Bald

Extremely short, match couldn't have gotten too boring when it was only 2 minutes long. Eugene takes it with the Hulkster Leg Drop **

Chris Benoit & Edge vs. La Resistance - Tag Team Championship

Since HBK was rightfully voted into the main event these two would compete for the tag team gold. Edge walks out and Benoit carries the match by himself and wins the gold, only to lose it back to the same team 2 weeks later. **1/2

Christy vs. Carmella - Lingerie Pillow Fight

Takes them longer to change than the match itself. Sexy changing by Christy anyway. Match is snore. ** Because of Christy

Shawn Micheals vs. Triple H - World Heavyweight Championship

Micheals was injured, but still put on one hell of a performance. I don't care when people say HBK's too old he will always be the greatest wrestler ever. As for Triple H's performance. YAWN he goes only for the knee, even after he said it wasn't injured. I know exploiting an injury is Triple H's gimmick, but give me a break. HBK carries it. ***

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair - Steel Cage Match

CLASSIC. Oh my god, this match was incredible. Both men give stellar performances. Orton takes it with the RKO *****",1099440000,,2151,4.696
2176296,2,B00068S3KU,"Chris Jericho v. ???????(Shelton Benjamin)  IC Title

  Why do you have some loser Shelton Benjamin beating the greatest IC Champ ever.  Explain......

Trish Stratus v. Gail Kim v. Molly Holly v. Stacy Keibler v. Victoria v. Jazz v. Nidia  Women's Title

  ???????(School Girls Match)

  The ending was so dumb and it happened to fast.  Molly knocks Stacy over Trish throws Molly over done deal.

Kane v. Gene Snitsky  ???????(Steel Chain Match)

  Okay its a chain match right.  Bischoff said only one weapon can be used.  Then why did Snitsky beet the hell out of Kane with the chair.  Snitsky wins. But I liked it.

Eugene v. Eric Bischoff  ???????  ( Loser gets head shaved bald)

  Good match actually even though it was 2 minutes.  Coach tries to stop Bischoff from getting his head shaved then Mr. McMahon comes down and makes Coach wear a dress.

Edge and Benoit v. La Reistance  World Tag Titles

  This match was ok.  Nothing great but when Edge walkes out Benoit reaction is priceless.  Benoit is awesome and wins tag gold.

Chrisy v. Carmella  Lingerie Pillow Fight

  Buyrates..........Buyrates................Buyrates........Christy wins.

HHH v. HBK  World Title

  Zapper 76 shut up HBK is God.  The only reason he loses is because of Evolution every single match.  This time Edge screws him. HHH wins.

Randy Orton v. Ric Flair  Steel Cage

  This is the only reason the PPV has 2 stars.  Orton hits RKO on the washed-up Ric Flair.",1099267200,,1448,4.8125
2176297,3,B00068S3KU,"WWE Intercontinental Championship: ***1/4, decent opener, but nothing that RAW could have aired the previous night, or the next week, or the week after...

Women's Championship: *: A poor battle royale which was far too short, I'm only gratful Kevin Na...I mean Stacy Kiebler didn't win the championship

Kane vs Gene Snitzky: *, Snitzky botched many spots in this match, as can be expected from someone as green as he is, and the stipulation was a joke, as Snitzky brought a steel chair into the match, the only good thing that came out of this was the booking of Snitzky as a monstrous animal.

Eugene vs Eric Bischoff: DUD, Eugene is a complete joke now, and Vince is determined to humilate Bischoff for his WCW sins, a time wasting strech that only becomes funny when Vince forces Coach to wear a dress

World Tag Team Championship: ***1/2: A good effort from Rob Conaway, but Greinier needed to be carried by Benoit, Benoit's win of a now almost worthless championship makes little to make up for the WWE rigging the votes in Michales' favour.

Carmella vs Cindy: DUD, save the porn for the Playboy channels

World Championship: **1/2: A poor effort given Michales' leg injury, but a lot of people seem to like this match despite his limitations, I'm not as blind, props to Hunter for carrying the match.

Randy Orton vs Ric Flair: **: Decent RAW match, but ten times better than the previous match, Flair is a legend who can make himself and his opponent look great in victory or defeat, it's a shame Hunter will never be the Nature Boy he idolises.

Taboo Tuesday was a card that failed to deliver the expectations that many people were hoping it would, Hunter/Michales made for great drama, but not a great match, Edges' heel turn and Snitzky's monster push began extremly well for both of them",1099180800,,1802,4.680379746835443
2176298,4,B00068S3KU,"And so ended the first ever ""fan controlled' ppv in the wwe. Now even though some matches weren't great, it was the fact that the fans basically made the matches that made this okay to watch.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho: Hey, this is pretty good for an opening! Shelton Benjamin and jericho can put on a good match, even though they didn't know they would face each other seconds before the match began. Shelton wins after a T-bone suplex to win his first intercontinental championship! good moment after when both men shook hands. 8/10

Women's battle royal for women's championship: The fans got to choose what outfits the divas would wear and they choose school girl outfits! The male fans were the winners here! They was pretty good, and trish retains her title. 7/10

Kane vs. Gene Snitsky: The fans choose a chain for the weapon, and the match itself was pretty good, but I thought the chair would have been better. However Snitsky used a chair to severly injure kane's throat. After the match Snitsky also beat Kane up again near the entrance. an okay match, and this Snitsky guy is intimidating sometimes. 8/10

Eugene vs. Eric Bischoff: The match was two minutes long and Eugene wins. Bischoff and Coach tried to get Bischoff to keep his hair after the fans voted for the loser to shave his head. But here comes Mr. McMahon to the rescue. Long story short, McMahon made Bischoff shave his head, and Coach wear a dress. Funny, but the match sucked. 5/10

Edge and Benoit vs. La Resistance: Since Shawn Michales was choosen to face Triple H Edge and Benoit teamed up to try and win the tag titles. However Edge decided to abandon Benoit and walked out. But Benoit fought back and won the titles all by himself! This is definately the year of Chris Benoit! Good match, but very slow in the beginning. 7/10

Christy vs. Carmella: Seriously, the time it took for these two to change was longer than the match. As we all know it was a ""Lingerie pillow fight"" I mean come on, Aerobics challenge? Please, who wants that over this? Christy wins, but this is definately a bad match, lots of feathers were in this one. 5/10

HHH vs. HBK: Now I'm a fan of any HHH HBK match, but since Shawn was hurt this isn't their best one on one match. Lots of submission holds and the figure four went on for way too long. However the fans participation was excellent so that helped. But here comes Edge who spears HBk and costs him his match to start their fued. Good match, but not their best one on one together. 7.5/10

Randy Orton vs. Ric Flair, Steel Cage Match: Now this will be a classic one day. I was surprised by the chemistry between Flair and Orton in this one. Lots of blood, and some good moves by both men as they get thrown into the cage. Flair's brass knucks couldn't help him in this. And Randy gives his RKO after ducking a chair shot for the win. Another good moment when both men shake hands.

I would reccomend this for the steel cage, the chain match, and the diva battle royal. This is good, and most of the matches are at least watchable.",1098662400,,3057,4.46415770609319

Diva Battle Royal........ SCHOOL GIRL

Man Trish Stratus was looking hot and she ends up holding onto her title.

Eugene vs. Bischoff

8040388,5,B00068S3KU,"I don't think WWE had one bad PPV in 2004! They were all pretty good and it got even better when Raw debuted the Taboo Tuesday PPV. This PPV was unlike others and took place on a Tuesday night (obviously) with the concept being that it was the first interactive PPV in WWE which gave fans the power to be General Manager for one night only by choosing matches and stipulations - creating an unforgettable night of unpredictable excitement! In reality, the polls were obviously rigged for this PPV but it was still a great one, nonetheless

- The PPV started off with The Coach announcing what outfit the Divas would wear in their Women's Championship Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal. The 3 choices were a School Girl, French Maid, or a Nurse. The poll results came in with School Girl having the majority vote

1.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (c) vs Shelton Benjamin

- Chris Jericho walked into the match as Intercontinental Champion and waited to see who is opponent would be. Pretty much the entire Raw midcard roster were eligible to be voted on for the match. Rhyno, Christian, Batista, The Hurricane, and Tajiri were just a few names to choose from. Shelton Benjamin ended up winning the vote and the match too become the new Intercontinental Champion. Was a great, athletic match

2.) Women's Championship Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal: Trish Stratus (c) vs Victoria vs Molly Holly vs Jazz vs Nidia vs Gail Kim vs Stacy Keibler

- This match is decent in terms of entertainment and sex appeal. The crowd absolutely ate up what the divas wore for the match and Stacy Keibler and Trish Stratus were arguably the favorites going into the match. The only diva to lose a shirt in this match was Nidia, who had it ripped off by Jazz and I believe was the first eliminated. The final 3 divas in the match are Trish, Stacy, and Molly Holly. Molly eliminates Stacy and Trish eliminates Molly to retain the title. What some probably don't know is that Stacy was originally supposed to win the match and Women's Championship but she declined because she felt she wasn't worthy of having the title

3.) Kane vs Gene Snitsky: Chain Match

- This match came about when Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, causing him to fall on top of a pregnant Lita, causing her to have a miscarriage. This began a babyface turn for Kane and a heated feud between Snitsky and Kane. The weapons to choose from in this match were a Chain, a Steel Chair, and a Pipe. The chain got the majority vote and the match was underway. This was an okay brawling match that saw all three weapons come into play at some time throughout the match. Snitsky wins the match after coming off of the second rope onto a steel chair that was wrapped around Kane's neck and pinned him for the win. Kane was coughing up blood after the match and loaded on to a stretcher only to have Snitsky push him off the stretcher and injure Kane more

4.) Eugene vs Eric Bischoff: Hair vs Hair Match

- Eric Bischoff had been out to make Eugene's life a living hell ever since he debuted earlier that Spring and it call came to head in this match. Coach decided to wait until the end of the match to get the poll results so we started off with the match. The match lasted around 5 minutes with a leg drop. The three stipulations for the match were: Loser gets his head shaved, Loser wears dress for a month, or Loser is winner's servant. Loser gets his head shaved was the chosen stipulation and Bischoff discovers he's getting a haircut! Bischoff tries to make a run for it but Vince McMahon comes to ringside and forces Bischoff to have his head shaved or he'll be fired. While Bischoff's hair goes from black to gray, Vince makes Coach put on a dress! The post-match segment was really hilarious!

5.) World Tag Team Championship Match: La Resistance (c) vs Chris Benoit and Edge

- This was a good solid Tag Team match put forth by Benoit and La Resistance. I would mention Edge but he wasn't really into this match at all due to the fact that he was still steaming about not winning the majority vote to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge ends up walking out of the match and leaving the arena, leaving Benoit to fight the rest of the match on his own. Benoit somehow managed to overcome the odds and win the World Tag Team Championships from La Resistance

6.)Christy Hemme vs Carmella: Lingerie Pillow Fight

- This match stemmed from envy brewing inside of Carmella for Christy Hemme winning the Raw Diva Search and not her. With the 2 consistently trying one up each other, they settled at Taboo Tuesday in a Lingerie Pillow Fight. The other two choices were an Evening Gown match or an Aerobics Challenge. The match lasted around the two minutes and ended with Christy getting the pinfall victory over Carmella

7.) World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (c) vs Shawn Michaels

- With the other 2 opponents being Edge or Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels won the majority vote and was granted a World Title match against Triple H at Taboo Tuesday. After supposedly injuring his knee the night before on Raw, HBK walked into this match injured, limping to the ring and all throughout. Triple H targeted Michaels' knee the entire match, and you know Michaels sold the injury well. This match was obviously nowhere as good as there previous PPV encounters, strictly due to the fact that Shawn was ""injured"". Michaels came close to winning after nailing Triple H with Sweet Chin Music, but Batista distracting the referee gave Edge enough time to come through the crowd and nail Shawn Michaels with a Spear, allowing Triple H to get the pinfall and retain the title

8.) Ric Flair vs Randy Orton: Steel Cage match

- The other 2 match types fans could vote for was a Submission match or a Falls Count Anywhere match but Steel Cage won the majority vote and we got Orton and Flair battling it out in a Steel Cage match. This match was decent but not good. Plenty of dirty moves used throughout the match and plenty of head banging and rubbing against the Steel Cage. Both men bled during the match and Orton gets the victory with an RKO, adding Ric Flair to his list of legends he's defeated. After the match, Orton and Flair showed a mutual form of respect for each other with a handshake and a hug to end Taboo Tuesday

Overall: Taboo Tuesday 2004 was a great PPV to kick off the 4 year long series. I personally feel that Taboo Tuesday 2004 was the best out of Taboo Tuesday 2005 and the Cyber Sundays.

8040391,3,B00068S3KU,"I had stopped watching wrestling around 2001 when the (then)WWF had purchased WCW and ECW. The wrestling landscape had felt flat at this point. Actually I did a similar move in the early 90's. The WWF had become too clownish around 1992 and I was no longer interested. I'd check back periodically but it wasn't until 1996 when the whole ""Monday Night Wars"" started sparking up when things got interesing again.

Well, I made a temporary revisit with an event called Taboo Tuesday 2004 to see how things were going in the wrestling world. All-in-all I'd have to say that there wasn't really anything ""Taboo"" about it. The action was ok but the storylines felt flat. Seeing retro acts such as HBK and The Nature Boy were a mixed bag.

HBK, charisma-wise, just seemed like a shell of his former self. Not enteraining at all. Slick Ric isn't too bad considering his advanced age. He hung nicely with the much younger Randy Orton. Most of the other matches were uninteresting to me. I wasn't terribly dissapionted in this event but neither was I all that thrilled either. Nothing to really draw me back to the world of Pro Wrestling.",1247356800,,1128,4.663316582914573

There were a few lows but almost every ppv does so but lets get started.*Note*- This was Joey Styles WWE debut, so it was good to see, but i did missed JR when he was gone during this period of time.

1. Matt Hardy & Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Masters & Gene Snitsky
I was kind of bummed out when Edge took himself out of the match and substituted Snitsky in his place but it still turned out to be a good match. Rey & Matt mostly carried this match performing their high flying ability they both have. Pretty good opener. 3.5/5

2. Rob Conway & Tomko vs. Eugene & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka
I didn't really cared for this match at first and then as i watched I was surprised that Snuka could really perform at a good pace, especially at his age. Good decent match. Snuka does his dive off the top rope for the win. 3/5

3. Carlito vs. Mankind
I really liked this match. It showed some good classic offense from Foley and some good atheticism that Carlito has. Too me this was a good match. Good match. 4/5

4. World Tag Team Championship
Trevor Murdoch & Lance Cade vs. Kane & Big Show
Kane & Show to me, makes a good big man tag team. Pretty good tag match & I also like Cade and Murdoch as a team, they are one of the best teams now a days. Show and Kane both look good in this one. It showed some funny spots as well. good overall tag match. 3.5/5

5. 3 on 1 Handicap Street Fight
Batista vs. The Coach, Goldust, & Vader
The match wasn't awful but it was bad lol. To be it was more funny and it was just bad. Bad match. 1/5

6. WWE Women's Championship
Full Fill Your Fanatsy Battle Royal
Ashley vs. Candace Michelle vs. Mickie James vs. Victoria vs. Maria vs. Trish Stratus
Better than '04's battle royal. Much better. Mickie wins it for Trish by eliminating herself and Victoria. 3/5

7. Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Triple H vs. Ric Flair
Great match. these 2 are the best in the world today so this was pretty much of a dream match to me. The first half of the match is pretty all Triple H with HHH busting open Flair in the beginning. then it would become all Nature Boy with Flair applying the Figure 4 on HHH then bringing a steel chair into the cage and then hitting HHH 5 or 6 times straight. Just a very, very, brutal match. 5/5

8. WWE Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle vs. John Cena
This was a very good triple threat match. I was really shocked but then again I wasn't because Angle and Michaels are both world class wrestlers and them two made this match. Good table spot as well. A great triple threat match. 4.5/5

Taboo Tuesday '05 was pretty good. Much better than Cyber Sunday 06 and possibably better than Taboo Tuesday 04. pretty good event.",1214870400,,2785,4.259469696969697

This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Taboo Tuesday 2004
Taboo Tuesday, which is now known as Cyber Sunday, was one of the most innovative PPV experiences you'll ever partake in. The fans would get to choose the matches. Taboo Tuesday was extremely unsuccessful due to it being a PPV on Tuesday night; which is why it was moved to Sunday night. This DVD isn't really all that great, but it has some decent contests on it. I don't suggest you run out and buy it though.

The show starts with Coach revealing himself as the host-like guy of the show. You quickly learn that the Divas match later on his be contested in schoolgirl clothes.

WWE Intercontinental Championship
Fans Choose the Opponent (Other choices- 14 other Raw stars)
Chris Jericho(c) VS Shelton Benjamin
This shows starts off with a bang as the upcoming Shelton Benjamin gets a shot at Jericho's belt. The match is solid and features some good near falls toward the end, but overall it could've been a lot better.
RATING- 7/10

After this match we learn that, out of Benoit, Edge, and Shawn Michael, Shawn will be taking on the World Heavyweight Champion later in the night.

Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal- Schoolgirl Outfits (Other choices- French Maid, Nurse)
Women's Championship
Trish Stratus(c) VS Victoria VS Molly Holly VS Jazz VS Nidia VS Gail Kim VS Stacy Keibler
This is just a big waste of time and the only thing worth checking out is King's commentary.
RATING- 2/10

Weapons Match- Chain (Other choices- Steel Chair, Lead Pipe)
Kane VS Gene Snitsky
Lita had a baby by Kane. Snitsky hit Kane in the back with a chair and he fell on Lita, costing her the baby. Tragic. This match is really slow paced, but fur some reason appeals to me a little. You won't see many innovative moves with the chain. Snitsky seems to do the same moves over and over again with it. Still, I did find the match somewhat appealing and loved the aftermath.
RATING- 6/10

Loser Gets His Head Shaved Bald (Other choices- Loser is servant or wears a dress)
Eugene VS Eric Bischoff
The match lasts around 2 minutes with Eugene picking up the victory. The aftermath is pretty funny and gives this one a few points.
RATING- 4/10

World Tag Team Championships
La Resistance(c) VS Chris Benoit & Edge
Edge and Benoit would be teaming together due to them not being picked for the Heavyweight title match. Edge isn't exactly on his game because he's upset that the fans didn't vote for him and Shawn is hurt anyway. The match is boring and the only thing worth seeing is Edge leaves the arena and Benoit still wins it.
RATING- 2/10

Lingerie Pillow Fight (Other choices- Aerobics Challenge, Evening Gown Match)
Christy Hemme VS Carmella
The take more time changing into the outfits than the pillow fight takes. Hemme looks great though.
RATING- 3/10

World Heavyweight Championship (Match of the DVD)
Triple H(c) VS Shawn Michaels
Michaels' leg is injured badly so you wouldn't expect much of a match right? Wrong, these two still put on one of the top match on the card. Michaels can barely stand and Trips is working on his leg most of the match. Michaels fights as hard as he can. Not their best match, but different and cool in it's own way.
RATING- 7.5/10

Steel Cage (Other Choices- Submission, Falls Count Anywhere)
Randy Orton VS Ric Flair
This was a solid Cage match, but I felt it was lacking a lot of good action. Most of the match consists of chops and low blows. Both men bleed a lot. There aren't too many uses of the cage itself.
