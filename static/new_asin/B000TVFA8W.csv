2910726,3,B000TVFA8W,"Although the information is accurate up to a point, the documentarian utilized a most annoying format, after a few minutes of watching pictures fade in and out I was ready to give up on the film.  Then it seemed to start again and became and interesting look at what  happened to Holland during the occupation.  However, it paints a bit to rosy a picture of resistance.  Few Dutch resisted.  There was for the most part passive collaboration and all to often active collaboration.  Only a handful of Dutch Jews survived and Holland had its own transport camps were Jews waited to be shipped east, held captive by fellow Dutch men and women.  It would be a better movie if in fact the documentarian had set aside the ""artistic"" rendering in favor of a look at what is a complicated, painful history.",1338249600,18,798,4.617021276595745
2910727,4,B000TVFA8W,The people in this movie gave a detailed experience of their stories. The resistance was another important part of the war and the people who lived it made me feel a part of it. I thought it was very informative and touching.,1333065600,,225,4.380952380952381
2910728,5,B000TVFA8W,"Since my parents and father-in-law were involved with the Dutch Underground during WWII, I was very interested when I heard about 'The Reckoning"". I was not disappointed at all. It was like I was listening to my father tell his story about life in Eastern Holland working with the Underground to do whatever necessary to help the Dutch people and deter the Germans. As I listened and watched, it was like listening to my Dad tell his stories.
This video is a great resource for my grandchildren who loved their great-grandfather but never really understood all he had done during the war OR what was happening to the Dutch people. Neither my father or father-in-law liked to talk much about their experiences but enough was said that we all knew that the things done were to bring liberation and freedom to the people of the Netherlands.
I have started working on our family tree, my husband and I were both born right after WWII, our children are first generation Americans, this video will be in our family history so future generations will learn of the sacrifices that so many Dutch men and women, including members of our family,  made for their country. This is a great resource!",1328486400,11,1185,4.72463768115942

2910730,5,B000TVFA8W,Very good description of how the Nazi horror spread through and effected the daily lives of the Dutch and how a proud brave few stood against them,1294531200,2,146,4.444444444444445
2910731,5,B000TVFA8W,"A superb documentary. Everyone on earth must know and remember what these brave, godly Dutch people did in facing the worst form of human evil. It shows us what is truly valuable in life and how to live. Never forget.",1269216000,4,217,4.45
2910732,1,B000TVFA8W,"This DVD, while aiming to shed light on the Dutch resistance, instead focused on the recollections of a few brave people. It couldn't decide whether it was a love story or a documentary as it jumped back and forth, maddeningly re-using again and again the same images of a train track clickety-clacking toward doom.  If you cut out all the visual filler, the story is thin ideed, which is too bad, because it could have been tightened up and enriched with maps and timelines and statistics relating to the positive impact brave resistors had on the survivors and on the war. The individuals' stories, while compelling, were not enough to make this a DVD worth watching.",1269129600,13,669,4.767241379310345
2910733,5,B000TVFA8W,"This piece is very well done.

2910734,5,B000TVFA8W,"This is an amazingly well done documentary. Very accurate, artistic, personable, engrossing! We remained riveted to the show and were unaware that over an hour and half passed.

2910751,5,B000TVFA8W,This was of particular interest to me because I had relatives living in Rotterdam at the time. I have no idea if any of them were involved in the resistance. My great grandmother and my great aunt were thought to have been killed in the German bombings. It was with great relief that my grandmother received word through the Red Cross that they were indeed safe. I do know they had Jewish friends and am sure they would have done whatever they could to help.,1481155200,,458,4.4
2910752,4,B000TVFA8W,interesting facts I was not completely aware of.,1481155200,,48,5.125
2910753,5,B000TVFA8W,"Very well done! The Netherlands Resistance was limited to so few brave, selfless souls--some who lived and some who died.  When I was young I used to think I would be one of those types of people who would stand up and be counted.  And when I was young, I probably would have.  But like the man states at the end of this well done documentary, prejudice and hated keep on and on and on, and nothing changes.  In my old age, I see that that  is the case and I don't know if I would step up today.  However, there are always new people coming alone on the stage of Life who get to experience what those who went before have already experienced--and decide for themselves to be the one who resists evil and fights it actively or to be the one who is evil and crushes the innocent or to be the one who hides their head in the sand.  In deep cognition, I have to reconsider that my younger self was the best self and hope I do the right thing in my remaining years to lessen the hatred that is so apparent everywhere on our planet.  This Dutch documentary is a very moving account of people who did extraordinary things for others when the world went crazy.  The world is still crazy.  This film encompasses nobility that is inspiring and helps me, as an audience of one, to understand the fact that life is short and the choice is always mine about what I want to contribute.  The consequences  to those who resisted were death for many and for those who lived, sadness and pain, yet, doing the honorable thing increased them all--these regular human beings who walked the earth chose to be spiritual giants of their time.",1480377600,5,1618,4.321192052980132

2910759,5,B000TVFA8W,"Very interesting documentary on the Dutch Resistance during World War II.  It brings the realities of the war home and shows what it was really like for the citizens of the Netherlands during the occupation and gradual, complete takeover of the entire country.  One by one, freedoms were taken away until they were all gone.  Then their very lives were taken as well.",1478649600,,367,4.7936507936507935

2910761,5,B000TVFA8W,very meaningful and worthwhile history that should be told again and again,1478217600,,74,5.25
2910762,5,B000TVFA8W,"The account of the Dutch Resistance and the men and women who sacrificed their own comfort and ""laid down their lives for another"" is utterly profound. Notice that there is always a remnant of people who seek to do what is right in the eyes of God. There, of course, will also continue to be those who seek to do only for personal gain. I rejoice in the examples of the former and pray I would be in that camp if needed. Painfully, sacrificially and lovingly profound are the adjectives I would use to describe this documentary.",1477872000,2,528,4.453608247422681
2910763,5,B000TVFA8W,"A documentary masterpiece that reveals the sad truth that the vast majority of the Dutch effectively were collaborators, while paying tribute to those hardly souls who risked all to save their countrymen and their country, but only rarely their Jewish neighbors.",1477785600,,262,5.414634146341464
2910764,5,B000TVFA8W,"A different and needed perspective on the triumph of the Jewish people over such evil.  It made me ponder if I would have been like their former neighbors - shunning them - after liberation.  And with shame, maybe yes. Documentaries like this one gives us the chance to develop character and decide ahead of time - to identify with the suffering, no matter the cost.",1477699200,,366,4.615384615384615

2910767,4,B000TVFA8W,This movie was good and informative but a little slow. Knowing that all the events were true I was glued to it. I could never watch it again because of the horrible sadness. I'm glad I watched it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to know history even when it hurts.,1428969600,,274,4.188679245283019

2910773,5,B000TVFA8W,"I regret that I waited eight years to finally view this documentary. Inspired to research and write of Diet's story, I finally dove in. It touched me at a visceral level and reminded me of things worth fighting for: the dignity and life of every human being made in God's image. It's easy to download via amazon video, and I hope you will. I will recommend it to many.",1401667200,,368,4.3478260869565215
2910774,5,B000TVFA8W,"During the German occupation, my Dad and his family nearly starved to death in Amsterdam.  My Dad lost almost his entire family to the death camps.  My Dad's 80 year old grandfather (a diamond cutter) was beaten in his home, dragged into the street and thrown into a truck.  He was taken to Westerbork (a Dutch concentration camp run by the nazis) where he died soon afterward.

The vast majority of Dad's other relatives died in Auschwitz.  My great uncle Abraham Bleekrode (a concert violinist) joined the Dutch Resistance and fought so others could live.  He died on February 20, 1945, in Buchenwalde, Germany, at the age of 53.

This documentary doesn't pull any punches.  It's heartbreaking to watch and reminds us all of the horrors endured by all too many during WWII.  We must NEVER forget these atrocities happened and are still happening now.  The only thing that's changed is the location and the people involved.",1396915200,8,924,4.828025477707007
2910775,3,B000TVFA8W,"The Reckoning: Remembering the Dutch Resistance- John Evans  - This is a heartbreaking film as are most that tell the first hand stories of the Holocaust.  It is important for people to never forget what happened and to personalize what the people endured, the atrocities inflicted upon them, and that few stood up for the oppressed, Jews or Christians.  Never again should this happen.  We should have the courage to stand.",1393891200,,424,4.929577464788732

2910777,5,B000TVFA8W,"The Dutch Resistance were fabulous. In of Europe, the Dutch did more to protect the Jews than anyone else. Of course, there were others who helped the Jews, but not enough of them.

I have a very close friend who was in Auschwitz and  the Nazi's removed her uterus with no anesthesia at all. Her little brother and father were with them when they were picked up in Hungry and he went straight to the gas chamber. She and her mother survived. I've know her for 30 years and she still doesn't want talk about it and refuses to drive and German car.

I've read just about every book out about the Holocaust because I was a nurse and worked for Jewish doctors and they had numerous patient who were holocaust survivors. Some would talk about it and others would never speak of what happened to them.

I sure it's more info that you wanted. You got it anyway.",1393200000,6,854,4.352201257861635
2910778,2,B000TVFA8W,"I've seen quite a few documentaries about survivor's stories and this was one of the worst. It is very slow, drags out the few stories that it offers and doesn't give very much insight.

2910779,5,B000TVFA8W,"Some of the lucky survivors of WWII were gathered in this film to tell their stories. We can read the personal stories, the history books and watch or read historical fiction on the subject of WWII and Hitler's Final Solution, but to see the faces of these survivors as they tell their personal stories is like living through it with them. Don't over look this video; it will restructure your realities and help put you in touch with life's true priorities.",1378425600,7,457,4.654320987654321

2910784,5,B000TVFA8W,I borrowed this movie from a friend who's father had been in the Dutch resistance. What a magnificent story. I can only hope if I was placed in the same situation I would do as those saviors did. It is an awe inspiring story of a very bleak time in the world. During the winter of 1944 when the citizens were starving to death and licking garbage can lids for food is a story that must be told and retold. It can never happen again - or can it? We owe it to the brave people who fought so hard against tyranny and oppression to ensure it never does happen again. Ever.,1349568000,15,568,4.080357142857143
