5015468,5,B006T0R1WU,"I am impressed with this series.  It's powerful, suspenseful, and well-plotted. There's good character development bolstered by an emotional ""pull"" that draws the viewer into caring about the people portrayed.  That extra dimension proves the skill of both the screenwriters and the actors.  The story line revolves around the character of Maria Wern, a seasoned police officer who is also a recent widow with two young children. Maria is played intelligently and sensitively by Eva Rose. The struggles that she endures, putting their lives back on track while pursuing her career as a senior police officer, resonate with the viewer as a genuine effort --  it is not a cliche-ridden treatment , or an overly-emotional one. The character does not wallow in self-pity; neither is she so numbed by her own suffering that she's devoid of compassion for others.  It's a believable blend. The other ensemble actors are also very good and their characters seem fleshed-out and nuanced --they are people one can relate to and come to care about. Personally, I found this especially true of Maria's boss, Thomas.  Thankfully, he is not portrayed as the typical stock character of a gruff-but-indulgent boss, or an administrator more concerned with the departmental budget than with effective policing. Neither is he a chauvinist who patronizes Maria.  It's so refreshing to have professionals portrayed as decent, normal folks who can rise above petty jealousies to do their jobs as a team. The plots are fairly inventive, though I've seen a similar opening gambit in another series (it's shocking and haunting, so heads-up). A further point is that it is offered in Swedish, but the subtitles are excellent and do not detract from the viewing experience. Overall, then, I do recommend this series as being intelligent, well-done, and compelling.",1344729600,26,1838,5.1891891891891895
5015469,5,B006T0R1WU,"I love this series!  It's filmed beautifully---just watching the scenery, houses, people is satisfying.  But it's also much better written than most U.S. crime dramas.  I recommend it highly.  Episodes 4-6 are equally compelling.",1336953600,5,229,5.647058823529412
5015470,5,B006T0R1WU,"This police/detective series, ""Maria Wern"" is a highly intense Swedish (with sub-titles) ""Police drama"" that, for me, is filmed in a very different part of the world (albeit a very pretty part of the world), that being on an island, with gorgeous sun-sets, in Sweden.  Maria Wern (wonderfully and very believably acted by Eva Rose--don't be fooled by her looks, she's tough), while always very concerned for her family and while very intently mourning the death of her husband, is a ""super"" cop  solving some very well written and directed horrible cases including a teen girl's(with a surprising secret) suicide, baby kidnapping,  ardent ""animal rights"" advocates that will use any means possible to get their points across, etc. I found all three (3) of the hour and one-half episodes to be very intriguing and ""nail biting ""good.

This series was acquired, by me, by accident (long story); however, I enjoyed it very much and intend to purchase more episodes in the series.",1336867200,13,976,5.006172839506172
5015471,2,B006T0R1WU,"The acting, story-lines,images and editing for this series are second-rate......spend your $$$$$ and time on series such as Silent Witness, Waking the Dead, Foyle's War or Dexter. Maria Wern has all the charm of a washcloth. I wasted my $$$ on this.......such is life.",1334966400,4,268,5.113636363636363
5015472,5,B006T0R1WU,"This is my favorite TV series at present. I love the story lines, the actors, and especially enjoy the gorgeous way this series is filmed. I find it totally inspiring on so many levels. Love getting to see a country I have not yet visited and feel as though I am in a bit of a trance seeing the beauty and imagery of the region. Eva Rose is lovely and the character she plays feels authentic as she does her best to be a single mom raising two kids and working as a police detective. One of the episodes includes a Papillon pup named Peggy that has also stolen my heart. One episode includes a wonderful young man with Down's syndrome who brought me to tears with his performance. This series has helped make winter so much more enjoyable.",1330560000,41,739,4.323741007194244

5015476,4,B006T0R1WU,"Entertaining crime series from Sweden.  After seeing the Millenium Trilogy and Wallender, I'm willing to try all the Swedish shows.  Acting is good and I found these entertaining.  Try the Irene Huss series if you like these.",1419379200,,225,5.027027027027027
5015477,4,B006T0R1WU,"I have read the books, and now I have seen 3 episodes, and is like the filmed version better than the book. Maria Wern, is not a likable character in the book, at least I did not like her.

Eva Rose who plays Police Inspector, Maria Wern, is a very attractive, intelligent woman. And, she is an excellent detective. Her loving husband has recently died, leaving her with two small children. They are all mourning. Luckily  Maria has a superb boss who adores her. He acts mean, but he really is a nice man.

In these three chapters, Maria meets up again with an old love she had in college. They parted on not good terms, and she tries to ignore him. See how it goes. The cases are difficult and dangerous, and somewhat follow the books. There are twists and turns, and surprises. This is a good series.

Recommended. prisrob 07-01-14",1404172800,,833,4.4605263157894735
5015478,5,B006T0R1WU,This time its the female detective doing all the thinking bringing a feminine approach to things. This series has freshened  up the well made Swedish cop series with some beauty as well as brains.,1400544000,,196,4.764705882352941
5015479,3,B006T0R1WU,"This is better than many American TV shows.  It's beautifully filmed (lighting, scenery, the camera work).  I'm a sucker for closeups and shows that take the trouble to reveal the human side of things.  I can't give it 5 stars because for me, the story lines and their trajectories aren't quite tight enough, meander somewhat, and don't have that WOW factor- that satisying Columbo-like PUNCH- of COURSE, that makes PERFECT sense, at the end.  Gratuitous elements are added for dramatic effect/shock value, rather than in service to a tight plot (example- **spoiler alert**- in episode one the severed head in the well made sense, the others, not so much).  A few too many coincidences, things that don't quite add up, loose ends tied up in improbable ways (Maria's neighbors on either side!) or not at all.

There's pathos but I just wasn't feeling it, for some reason.  I liked that time was taken to reveal particulars of characters' experiences (Maria looking longingly at her husband's photo, the chief interacting with his wife's dog) but for me the personal didn't go deep enough, I didn't feel I knew/understood these people, maybe too subtle for me.  It may be just YOUR cup of tea though and I do recommend it, worth seeing.

A similar though better series, that I HIGHLY recommend, (also with stunning scenery, and humanity, but with tidier plots and greater depth, though somewhat darker, an Irish show) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Single-Handed/dp/B0045YGPUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Single-Handed</a>.

5015481,5,B006T0R1WU,"I go into much more detail in my review of episodes 4 to 7. Suffice it to say here Episode 1, THE SPEECHLESS GOD, is based on Anna Jansson's 2000 novel  ""Stum sitter guden,"" Episode 2 ALL THE TRANQUIL DEAD on the 2001 novel ""Alla de stillsamma dda,"" and Episode 3 DREAMS FROM SNOW on the 2002 novel  ""M dden sova.""",1388620800,,314,4.131147540983607

5015483,4,B006T0R1WU,"if you are someone like me who has ingested just about every crime media from sweden and scandinavia, the problem becomes you start getting picky.  there is only so much new and different which can be done in crime shows and the swedes have already broken all records with wallander and salander.  of the females in crime detecting in sweden, liz salander is the best, from the millenium trilogy.  then irene huss comes next.  and finally maria wern, the cop in this series.  dare i say it?  she is almost too normal.she does not have any quirks which make her stand out from the pack although she is arguably the best looking..

in sum, i liked these cases with wern but i didn't love them.  if more were released tomorrow, i'd skip them.  if you have not seen much of swedish crime shows though, only american ones, it will probably strike you as terrific.

5015484,1,B006T0R1WU,"Maria Wern was a real disappointment. Eva Rose, who plays Maria. expresses emotion mainly by letting her hair hang loose to her elbows or, in tense scenes, putting it in a french braid. I don't know if she's trying to exprerss scandanavian stoicism or if she's just had too much botox, but she cycles through two facial expressions whether rescuing her daughter friom a murderess or greeting an old lover. And I am getting tired of female detectives in authority being presented with a cop on staff who looks like a matinee idol, complete with chiseled features and six-pack abs.
