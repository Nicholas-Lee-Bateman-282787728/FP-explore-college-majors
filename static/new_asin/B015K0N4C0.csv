8733869,2,B015K0N4C0,"Nice Songs, but mostly that. The DVD is listed as 90 minutes, but it's actually less than 38 minutes, which means the DVD is mostly singing.  If you want songs, that the DVD is very nice.  If you want to see New York at Christmas there is very little of that.  The New York portions mainly serve as an intro to a song.",1481414400,2,318,4.015873015873016
