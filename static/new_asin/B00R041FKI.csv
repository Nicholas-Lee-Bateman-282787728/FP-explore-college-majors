However, I am not purchasing this DVD since it is my hope that all seasons will eventually be released as a Blu-ray box set. Also, it would be wonderful if they added additional scenes not shown when the episodes aired.

Waiting and Hoping!",1448928000,,322,4.551724137931035

6892601,5,B00R041FKI,Treehouse Masters is one of my favorite shows on TV and to my delight it is becoming a favorite of my whole family from my 70 year old husband to our 5 year old grandson. Pete Nelson is so full of enthusiasm for people and fulfilling their dreams. His crew are great to watch as they create the masterpieces that Pete designs. We love season one of this marvelous show and can't wait til all four seasons are available on DVD.,1433980800,3,426,4.271604938271605
