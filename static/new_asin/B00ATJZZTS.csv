5509588,5,B00ATJZZTS,"It was nice to see the original start of Candid Camera on the Gary Moore show before it became a show of it's own. The shows with the children were simply great and the extra with Carol Burnett in a spoof of a Sci-fi show was something else. With all of the garbage on T.V. nowadays, of which I don't even bother with, these type of shows are so refreshing and this is what most of the people really want, but can't get except on re-runs. Gary was a heavy smoker which was normal back in those days, but I noticed that half-way through the season he quit smoking on camera. Good clean family fun for all!  +JMJ+",1365984000,5,611,4.177966101694915

5509590,4,B00ATJZZTS,"The company on its packaging claims ""See the laugh out loud sketches that started it all!"" and asserts''When Garry Moore added a segment called Candid Camera to his cutting edge TV show that featured CAROL BURNETT in the regular cast, it spawned a genre of entertainment that thrives more than ever in today's digital age.''

And the editorial review listed here on amazon claims: ''Available for the first time ever CANDID CAMERA's VERY FIRST SEASON''.

The above claims are all blatant lies and misrepresentations.

This is NOT the ''very first season'' Candid Camera was on the air, nor did Candid Camera begin as a segment on Garry Moore's variety show. Candid Camera first appeared on television in the late 1940's and went through a number of changes during its broadcast history, as a regular network series, syndicated series, and as a segment on a variety show. The contents of this DVD all consist of Candid Camera's residency as a sequence on Garry Moore's variety show during the 1959-1960 season. Garry Moore's regular cast of himself, Durwood Kirby and Carol Burnett appear in some of the clips here. But I didn't see Jack Benny or some of the other stars claimed to be included in the amazon editorial review.

I remember watching Garry Moore's show as a child in the early 1960's and it was usually fun to watch. Likewise I watched Candid Camera as a weekly series in the 1960's when it returned to the air in that form after the segments on this DVD were filmed. Candid Camera was always a good show in its various incarnations, and Allen Funt a great host.

I bought this 2-DVD set at Walmart several days ago for $9.96. Seeing the pictures of Garry Moore on the cover was of some concern before I made the purchase, remembering being ripped off last fall when I ordered the ""Carol Burnett Christmas"" DVD (also from this same company) which was promoted in a manner suggesting it was Christmas segments from the Carol Burnett Show then turned out to be bits from the Garry Moore Show.

The material here is generally enjoyable. So why do the owners of The Garry Moore Show films believe they have to deceive buyers to sell a good show on DVD?  The Garry Moore Show was a good show. If they just told the truth, buyers wouldn't feel they've been fooled and tricked into buying the DVD after they start watching it, and would probably appreciate it more having known what they were buying.

As for the Candid Camera segments on the DVD, some of them are great and made me laugh, and most of the others made me smile. A few seem pretty boring now, and it looks like time has taken a real toll on the video images. Expect poor quality, grainy black and white viewing. I'm sure there's no way to improve that, so the DVD company cannot be blamed for the video quality. There are a few extra, non-Candid Camera skits from The Garry Moore Show featuring Carol Burnett and Andy Griffith that are also enjoyable. I think the producers should consider doing some full-DVD releases of material from The Garry Moore Show and title it as such.

In general, if you're a baby boomer or older and remember the old Candid Camera shows from the 1960's, you'll probably enjoy this DVD set. Younger viewers probably aren't going to appreciate it at all. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone over 50.",1363392000,21,3306,4.6183986371379895
8557575,4,B00ATJZZTS,"I realize that this is not taken from the celebrated prime-time version of CANDID CAMERA that ran from 1960-1967. It is is no way a ""first season"" or the earliest version of CAMERA. It is well worth buying because it is FUNNY. These are some of the best CANDID CAMERA segments ever staged. This is Allen Funt in his prime, and also includes a young Carol Burnett participating in a few of the episodes. Don't worry about not knowing who Garry Moore is or that the show is B&W and technically not of HD quality. Get it for the laughs!",1486425600,,533,4.34
8557576,5,B00ATJZZTS,Always watched the show on Sunday nights (didn't have the name reality tv back then) and found it very entertaining and amazing some of the stunts that were pulled and what had to be created or just thought of to make them successful.,1457136000,2,234,4.465116279069767

8557580,1,B00ATJZZTS,Very disappointing!  Old footage from the Gary Moore show.  Filmed before Candid Camera developed into the classic show it later became.  Definitely not worth the money!!!!!,1395964800,7,173,5.576923076923077
8557581,3,B00ATJZZTS,"Yes this was not the first season of CC. Yes these were segments from its season as part of The Garry Moore Show. Yes the shows are complete with many non-CC segments.

So what?

How marketable is a DVD called The Garry Moore Show to anyone under a hundred?

This CD contains the entire season of The Garry Moore show when CC was a segment and is marketed to Candid Camera fans.

Fine with me.",1376265600,,393,4.2

8557584,1,B00ATJZZTS,"This is a SMALL selection of Candid Camera episodes from the Garry Moore show in 1959. As with most Candid Camera shows, it's fun to watch and somewhat educational. It's interesting to see how the show evolves over a few months.

Any product which is deceptively advertised, however, will get just 1 star from me. This product loses on two counts. First, the Amazon description states and the packaging strongly implies that this is the very first season of Candid Camera; in reality, it had been on network television since 1948. Second, when something is published on two DVDs, you'd expect at least three hours of content.  This set only runs 90 minutes, which could easily fit on one DVD. It also loses points for including only the first part of a multi-part episode.",1366416000,15,772,4.753731343283582
