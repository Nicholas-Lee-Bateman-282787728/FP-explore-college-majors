174755,5,0001526863,"This is a great kids movie!  I love how Scripture verses are used with every song.  I had this DVD as a kid and enjoyed watching it, learning the songs and learning God's word.  The clothes that the kids wear on the movie are a little outdated but the songs will never be.  I think that although this is aimed at children, adults can also learn from the verses.  The songs are very catchy and I actually remembered them all from when I was a kid.  Now both my sons enjoy watching and dancing with the DVD.",1409529600,4,505,4.154639175257732

174757,4,0001526863,This was a replacement/upgrade for a VHS version already owned.  Our only disappointment was that there are no chapter breaks for individual songs.  So it takes a L-O-N-G time to cue to a particular selection for children to sing with.  (Of course you have the same problem with VHS.),1400284800,2,284,4.755102040816326

Throughout the day I may have to use one and the just start singing! My 18-month old can sit and watch this dvd over and over again, he even tries to sing with the other kids! A great buy! I wish there was one to go with Vol. 2.",1376697600,2,361,3.641025641025641

Is there anything better than hearing my 3 year old going around singing ""Christ who strengthens me"" or ""Overcome evil with good""?
Tunes are so catchy---I sing them myself!",1301529600,2,218,4.615384615384615
174771,5,0001526863,"My 19-month daughter loves this dvd. The clothes are a bit dated and the quality of the video isn't top notch, but the songs help her to memorize scripture. She tries to sing along and does the hand motions. I love that she can be entertained and have the Bible verses that Steve Green sings driven into her long-term memory; my prayer is that God would use these memories later in life to draw her to Him.

Then cool thing is that the songs on the DVD are the same as on the CD, so when we're in the car she can sing along.

Highly recommended.",1264032000,9,545,4.132075471698113
