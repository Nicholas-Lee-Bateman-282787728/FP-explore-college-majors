8343158,3,B001U91ZJK,"El Imperio de Dracula - Dracula's Empire  WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS THAT IF THIS MOVIE WAS SHOT ORIGINALLY IN COLOR WHY ARE THEY SELLING DUPPED BLACK & WHITE COPIES ISN'T THIS COPYRIGHT INFRIGMENT? The Count in this movie is actually called  DRACUSTEN (get it!!!) played by the famous during the 1960's & extremely handsome dark-haired mexican actor (a lot of grease on his hair LOL!!!!) Mr. Erik del Catillo. Also of special mention ranchera singer/actress Ms. Lucha Villa who at times looks more uncomfortable than scared. Both Ms. Villa & Mr. del Castillo made far better movies during their long acting careers. There are some good gothic touches here and there in this movie that at times you think you are watching a black & white adaptation of the excellent old COLOR HAMMER FILMS (Brides of Dracula, Dracula Prince of Darkness, Horror of Dracula) that after having watched those, THIS MOVIE JUST BECOMES AN OK EFFORT THAT PALES IN COMPARISON. No english subtitles. The picture & sound transfer just OK.",1425600000,,1012,4.877906976744186
8343159,5,B001U91ZJK,"I thought I watched it in color on Univision, but when I watched the DVD it was in black and White. I still love the movie and will buy it again when I find it in color.",1406246400,2,169,3.5945945945945947
8343160,4,B001U91ZJK,This was an entertaining horror flick with a decent script and better acting.  The fact that it is in black and white adds to the terror quotient.  I found it very entertaining and thrilling.,1328659200,5,191,4.588235294117647
8343161,3,B001U91ZJK,"Unfortunately, this DVD contains a black and white print of the movie (it was shot and released in color, and still airs in color on Spanish TV stations from time to time).  Too bad, hopefully someone will do it right someday.",1267574400,4,226,4.512195121951219
