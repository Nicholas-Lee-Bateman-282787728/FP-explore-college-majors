2986724,4,B000WMEAPC,"Set in the stunningly beautiful Provencal region of France, ""The Man of My life"" looks at how both passion and responsibility play an equally crucial role in defining who we are and how we love.

Frederic (Bernard Campan) and Frederique (Lea Drucker) are a happily married couple who enjoy entertaining large groups of people at the country home where they vacation.  One day, Frederic invites their next door neighbor, a single gay man by the name of Hugo (Charles Berling), over for a get-together with family and friends.  Soon, Frederic and Hugo have struck up a friendship largely centered on their mutual addiction to running and their propensity to talk the night away over such weighty matters as love, passion, responsibility, freedom, commitment and marriage.  Hugo tries to convince Frederic that his role as dutiful husband and father has robbed him of his individuality and earlier lust for life, while Hugo, spurned by his father at a young age, comes to his own understanding of the importance of family by the end.  There's an obvious sexual attraction between the two men, but the movie goes far beyond the typical coming-out drama to explore romantic passion in all its myriad complexities and forms.

Frederic is torn between the desire to continue loving the wife who so obviously loves him and who has provided a stable home for him and their children - and this new found feeling for Hugo that he can, in no way, shape or form, even begin to understand.  The movie never feels the need to judge any of the characters; it presents them simply as well-meaning but flawed human beings who struggle on a daily basis, as all of us do, with an array of emotions, needs and desires that continually come into conflict with one another.

The screenplay by Zabou Breitman and Agnes de Sacy employs long, winding conversations to reveal the truths about the characters and the relationships that help to define them.  Moreover, the sensuous, bucolic setting, far from being a mere backdrop to the foreground action, actually serves to pull us into the lives of these people as they while away a languid summer swimming, hiking and exploring the inner workings of their own roiled psyches.

In his direction, Breitman has come up with interesting, slightly abstract ways of filming the commonplace details of everyday life, utilizing extreme close-ups, distorted angles, catawampus framing and mosaic-style storytelling to impart a lyrical tone to the film.

Superb performances by the three leading players also add greatly to the emotional richness of the piece.

With a great deal of insight and tenderness, ""The Man of My Life"" presents us with a subtly provocative, beautifully realized and psychologically complex view of the human heart.",1246060800,29,2755,5.00437636761488
2986725,5,B000WMEAPC,"This is not a gay movie. This is an enjoyable piece of art, which can be watched by both gay and straight people. The problem of Fred about finding his sexual identity should not be restrained to a gay audience. The beautiful cinematography, the perfect captivation of symbolic moments and finally the amazing and serious performances of the main characters (specially Fred's wife), make this film an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended.",1233360000,11,446,5.295774647887324
2986726,5,B000WMEAPC,"...........or:  ""FRED DISCOVERS HE'S BEEN MISSING SOMETHING"" (alternate title for this review).

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-Addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

This is a love story.........a falling-in-love story. Yes, it's a love story, pure and simp.... Oh, wait, maybe it's not so simple after all. Why? Well, just think how shattering it must be to have spent the majority of your adult life in a happy and loving heterosexual marriage.......only to have another ordinary day come along, one in which you unexpectedly meet a someone of the same sex........and you suddenly face the beginnings of a new love. That's what this film is about, and the DVD back cover description of the story also lays it out for us in a nutshell:

{""While on holiday at his family's home in Provence, Frederic's seemingly perfect family life is disrupted when he meets his neighbor, a graphic artist named Hugo. Suddenly, Frederic's entire existence is thrown out of order as the two men develop an attraction to each other, both intelllectually and emotionally, which destroys the once perfect relationship between Frederic and his wife.""}

In this ""typically French"" film, we're fairly quickly introduced to two men: Frederic (""F""), a seemingly happily married man with a wife (Frederique), child and extended family residing in their vacation villa. We first see scenes not only of this fairly large group's family interactions, but also intimate interludes between just this man and his wife. Closeness, caressing and kissing abound in this couple's first scenes (but, wait.......we then discover that physical intercourse on his part seems to have become difficult to achieve). We then meet our second male lead, Hugo (""H""), a graphic designer who resides next door. He's an unashamedly ""out"" gay man who, through the course of the film, becomes as increasingly fascinated with ""F"" as Frederic becomes with him. ""H"" is a man who happily and easily frequents a local gay bar, as well as ""entertains"" a string of handsome young men in his home. One of the first times we and Frederic are invited into ""H's"" home/studio we are confronted by a stunningly beautiful, young god of a man----nude and seemingly levitated far above our heads in a semi-fetal, sleeping position. It is an image that any famed museum/gallery in the world would die for. It is later on in this same residence's main, living area walls that we will see projected an ever changing and increasing array of letters, words, phrases (apparently produced by the sun's light entering large windows on which these letters, etcetera, have been placed). They appear, move and fade with changes in the sun's position and brightness. We come to discover these words and phrases have originated in the two men's second meeting-up, at a family party, followed by an into-the-wee-morning-hours, one-on-one conversation between just the two of them (Frederic's discovery of this wall projection phenomenon indicates to him the importance to Hugo of that first night's lengthy interaction between them). It should be noted that we visit and revisit this hours long conversation, which touches on life philosophy and love, at various points throughout the entire film. It's during these hours, as their comfort with one another deepens, that we watch as Hugo becomes more touchy-feely with Frederic, who himself becomes more comfortably at ease. In a revealing moment, we then witness their time together coming to its early morning conclusion, with ""H"" leaving for home, while softly voicing to ""F"" the ultimate in personal compliments. I must ask here what would be your reaction, dear reader, if your newfound, and liked, departing companion directed to you the words, ""You're devastating?"" Ah, yes.......well, for Frederic it obviously becomes the start of something completely new and different in his life.

Complimenting these intensely personal and emotional scenes, there is a stunningly beautiful progression of outdoor / landscape scenes, one in particular showing the two men on a morning run, with an ankle-injured Frederic being carried home on Hugo's back. ""H"" wends their way through a very large field of what appears to be blooming garlic (unusually lovely, to say the least), and then through a huge and magnificent field of sunflower blooms. Tellingly, ""F's"" arms are clasped around ""H's"" shoulders and neck, with the side of his face resting against the back of Hugo's head (and this is the scene unhappy wife, Frederique, sees upon their arrival at the villa). There shortly follows a quickening of the feelings between the two as we watch a recuperating Frederic, half dozing on a patio lounge chair, and then sensing the presence of another. He opens his eyes to a quietly arrived and serious faced Hugo. A smile slowly lighting his features, ""H"" utters: ""I came to see about you. I'll get back to work now."" The look of self-satisfaction then appearing on ""F's"" face tells us more than could a thousand words.

Perhaps the most significant indication of the depth of growth in the relationship of these two men occurs near film's end, upon Frederic's learning of Hugo's impending temporary departure from the area. Limping his way to seek out ""H,"" he finds him outside the area's gay nightclub. Responding to Hugo's questions, ""Why did you come? Why are you here? You want to tell me something?"" Frederic responds: ""You're leaving-----."" Frederic then approaches ""H"" to bring them standing as physically close as possible, forehead to forehead, eyes closed. After a few moments, Frederic turns suddenly and departs (it is this scene's DVD Chapter heading that the film director has labeled: ""In Love""----methinks she knows of what she speaks).

Moving on to other facets of this production, the film also contains any number of strange / unusual----and surreal-ish----scenes and camera shots, which include:

-- A weirdly located string quartet, set up and playing / practicing(?) at night in nothing larger than a tumbledown, yet strangely well lit, chicken coop (for want of a better description). The only viewing-in access to their performance seems to be a very small, dirty and opaque-ish window through which we see peering in at various times, first, the Halloween-like masked heads of children, then the head of ""F"" and, later, the side-by-side heads of both our male leads.

-- A nighttime village dance scene with that same quartet providing sensuous tango music for a beautiful young male / female couple's performance (scene later on morphs to that of a male / male performance to the same music strains).

-- A brief, close up view of slowly moving, crystal clear water in which only the long, very blond tresses of someone's unseen head are shown dreamily drifting and swirling (wife, Frederique's hair is of this color).

-- A late scene involving Hugo's standing before a gigantic, red door (he had earlier mentioned his family's home having a (normal sized) red one, so we do feel somewhat safe in concluding that this near end of film image relates to an earlier in life instance of his being kicked out by his own family----bet you have no trouble at all in arriving at what that resulted from).

-- There are other such unusual shots throughout the film, and if any of you out there is aware of their meanings, please feel free to provide your Comments in that area below. A strong wish on my part is that our lady director had taken the time in her DVD Special Feature comments to enlighten us in these matters (or, perhaps, her goal was for us to reach our own interpretations and conclusions). Additionally, there are things about the setup of this film that, to this viewer, are less than successful. There is an over abundance of scenes involving Frederic's extended family that seem virtually unnecessary to the progress of the film, chief of which are those involving possible rape of a young female. This scene definitely detracts from the forward progress of the film, as does the need for a couple of less than sensical family swimming forays.

Lastly, having just shortly ago spoken of Frederique (""F's"" spouse), this movie can be pretty much described as one, long downhill slide for her, emotionally and relationship-wise. Her last scenes are ones of frantic----and nude----ravings over her perceived connubial losses. AND, as to what Fred's future lifestyle plans for himself are, you'll have to watch this film and decide for yourself. To help you a little in doing so, in his last scene he does say to his sleeping small son: ""I'm wobbly, imperfect, broken pawed, heart-in-tatters. I love you, but know I still have to grow up. I'll come back. I'll come back to spar with you again."" This leads us to ask, at near middle age, what kind of growing up and finding out about himself does he still have left to do? Is he on the verge of departing.......and if so, will it be with someone?

So, dear readers of this page and viewers of this film, what do you think is the meaning of his final words........and what can they possibly portend for Hugo?

PS--Speaking of meanings, if you're wondering about this review's title (...little chair by the bed), you'll just have to check out the film for yourself. Happy viewing.

PPS--This film is becoming ""Addictive."" ***Other such habit formers:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-a-Question-of-Love/dp/B0008ENHXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just a Question of Love</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JOFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-Culture/dp/B000R7G9JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy Culture</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Over-the-Guy/dp/B00005QAQD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Over the Guy</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Second-Skin-Unrated-Version/dp/B000088UZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Second Skin (Unrated Version)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-I-Love/dp/B0000CBL9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man I Love</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Latter-Days-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0002I84JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Latter Days (Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mudge-Boy/dp/B000EGEKRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mudge Boy</a>

2986727,1,B000WMEAPC,"I had been curious about purchasing ""The Man of My Life"" reading all the viewer reviews etc.  Finally after reading all the reviews, most of which are 5*, I gave in and bought it.  This past weekend I invited 4 of my closest gay friends to Movie night claiming we were going to watch a great gay film.  Wow!  we were so disappointed ... I mean the film is long and boring not to mention the viewer never gets to see why the couple is having intimacy problems other than Fred's ED and we never get to see why Fred considers Hugo the man of his life.  Nothing ever happens between the two.  Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is impressive and beautiful, however  the story line leaves much to be desired.  NADA QUE VER!!!!!",1211155200,11,726,4.325925925925926
2986728,5,B000WMEAPC,"I enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish. It's so entertaining that you dare not blink! It offers great cinematography; the plot flows smoothly, and the cast brings each character to life with vivid portrayals. There's suspense, sexuality, comedy, and hardy emotion. And, most importantly, there are no gimmicky wrap-ups. What more could you ask for in an excellent movie!",1202860800,17,382,5.278688524590164
2986729,5,B000WMEAPC,"I loved this movie. The best gay themed film I've seen in years, and probably one of the better movies I've seen in general, in the last few years. The slow reveal of the main character's desire is brilliant. The axis that the whole movie turns on, and Bernard Campan carries the weight of the film admirably. With a story that is simultaneously tender and tortured in each scene, the director Zabou Breitman shows a deft hand in balancing the evolution of the three main characters. When the husband, the wife and the openly gay neighbour who arrives next door one summer, grow closer as the summer progresses everyone's charms are revealed in unexpected ways. The climax of the film was startling in its realistic portrayal of what would likely happen and the devastation it causes. Charles Berling is amazing in what starts out as a hard edged role that is softened by the end, to reveal layers of character that are unexpected. Truly a beautiful film to watch and a heartbraking story as it unfolds, from every angle.

Three cheers,

Joe",1200960000,43,1041,4.714285714285714
2986790,4,B000WMEAPC,"The movie unfolds more like a ""3D"" literary piece of literature. Lots of symbolism that open to the viewer's interpretation. It's is one of those good rare movies that you have to process after you have seen in toto.",1401148800,,216,4.564102564102564
2986791,3,B000WMEAPC,"This film attempts to capture in very artful, often pretentious passes, the unexpected and blossoming romance between a heterosexual French married/family man and the nihilistic, philosophical neighbor that he and his wife invite to dinner while vacationing for the summer in Provence. The acting is uniformly superb and the cinematography is exquisite: I watched chiefly due to the setting in one of France's most extraordinary landscapes.

The problem is that the characters are very thinly drawn, not especially engaging, and the premise is ... well, not convincing at all when you consider what the plot demands of the actors and the outcome of the story itself. What we have is an attempt to look with great melodrama and angst at what is basically a French straight guy (the character 'Frederic') developing a slight man-crush on the neighboring gay guy (the character 'Hugo') after a night of heavy drinking and talking about the meaning of life 'til dawn at the vacation rental in Provence.

That's the problem: I didn't buy the notion that this sort of post-drunken man-crush would really evolve into something earth-shattering with the Hugo character. It seemed a stretch, given the way the script was written. The emotions tossed about in subsequent scenes have an arbitrary, random, and almost self-consciously ""artsy"" character that detract from exploring this theme more convincingly and, as a result, my feeling about the ending/denouement was essentially, ""You're all a bunch of stressed-out French people who've had way too much to drink and gotten way too much sun while on vacation, like most people. Is there *possibly* a chance you're all freaking out for no compelling reason? Chill out, lay off the booze, take an aspirin and have a nap before you all have to go back to Paris or Toulouse and rejoin the rat-race.""

Anyhow, that's the ultimate impression I had, without giving any spoilers away.

A subsidiary plot-line involving the Hugo character and his dying father was a much more interesting idea and ought to have been the center of the story, with the tepid little Frederic/Hugo thing being a minor side-plot. But overall this was an artful little French movie with fine acting, interesting camera work, and ambient scenes of Provence that almost make-up for the half-baked storyline.

2986837,5,B000WMEAPC,"Visually, this is one of the most lush and beautiful explorations of the French countryside I've ever seen. It also captures the slow, languishing vacations of the French, the art of luxuriating in the moment that so many of us have long forgotten -- lazing by the river, slow picnics on the grass, strumming the guitar and venturing a tune, the long outdoor dinner table under the trees with guests of all ages, playfulness and compassion between parent and child...gaiety and wonderful exchanges, all-night, deep conversations until dawn. And then there are the relationships, slowly built through layers of sharing -- both pleasure and pain. There's the relationship of a man and his wife, played casually and authentically, between a mother and a jealous rambuctuous young son, complete with his hero cape, and then there is the husband's relationship with another man. The film allows the two men to explore the meaning of relationships and life with one another in long, complex conversations that gradually deepen toward their inward truths. If you're looking for titillation, this isn't for you. It's more about how people share (or don't share) with one another...about the sadnesses, hurts and failure that all relationships portend, but it's also about the laughter and playfulness, and sheer joy and comfort of togetherness. Like the river, slowly flowing onward, so do the relationships. The pure, unhurried luxury of this! Such sheer contrast to the frenzied, neurotic film making of Americans with all the gratuitous sex and shallowness.

The slow pacing, the surreal qualities, the idyllic setting, the alternately heated then meandering dialogue, and attractive cast all combine to produce a multi-layered slice of life of the various characters. The pacing was a bit too leisurely for my American tastes but after the first 20 minutes I found myself seduced by the lazy pace of families on holiday doing everyday holiday activities. This being a gay-themed movie, I confess I was on tenterhooks waiting for the two main male characters to ... you know. I won't ruin the ending by writing if my expectation was satiated.

At that point, she ""knew""! What a beautiful, tender, and emotional moment. Few directors can create those authentic emotional moments of epiphany.

The opening cinematography and how the scenes are framed is visually engaging. Had this film been placed in more capable hands in the way of a director and a good editor, this could have been a stellar film. As it is, you have a film that is way too focused on trying to be artistic to the extent that it weights down the whole plot. Scenes move way too slowly and just when the dialogue gets interesting, the director cuts away to some contrived artistic element, whether it's showing the same scene over again (but from a different viewpoint) or showing some unrelated visual element. There is actually a scene where the director inexplicably focuses the camera on a vinyl seat cushion rising after one of the actors stands. Then there's the confusion of trying to understand which actor is speaking what lines when the director filmed the conversation from way too far away. This happens repeatedly throughout the film.

I did. What I do not get is why people think that for a movie to reach it's artistic peak, it must either be very sad, or must have an unfulfilling ending. This notion is mainly championed by suckers for pain and angst, who think life is incomplete without them. Now, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, because I enjoyed it and I advise others to watch it.

One of the developments in the last 20 years of Gay Lib (to use an old-fashioned term) is that there is now a wealth (a glut?) of gay-themed movies, most of which, IMHO, are like the majority of mainstream movies: fair to lousy.  So in part it was my lowered expectations that helped to create the sense of wonder and discovery that viewing this film brought.  It avoided EVERY cliche of the falling-in-love themed film (gay or straight) but was incredibly moving and lyrical too.  I'm afraid of putting potential viewers off by overpraising this ""little"" film, but for me, after one viewing it's a highlight of the past couple of years.",1341964800,5,773,4.833333333333333

2986866,4,B000WMEAPC,"I think the movie is beautiful, but it sometimes got lost in that beauty. The cinematography, while, beautiful, makes the movie drag a bit.

You know, Fred's character was beautifully played. As a gay man, I'm usually rooting for the man to leave the wife and find his true self -- the one he probably locked away because of responsibility -- but in this movie, I truly felt the pain the wife goes through. In all the ""gay"" movies I've watched, this is the first time I've felt that pain. And it made me cry.

One of the things I like about French movies is representation of real people and part of that representation is of their bodies. I never felt like the nudity was gratuitous. It was integrated into the lives of the characters and it made them more real to me.

Overall, I think this movie is great. The ending was dramatic, but in a subdued way. But if you are the kind of movie goer who likes action, even some action, then this movie might be a little slow for you.",1322697600,3,977,4.298913043478261

3221221,4,B000WMEAPC,"Set in the stunningly beautiful Provencal region of France, ""The Man of My life"" looks at how both passion and responsibility play an equally crucial role in defining who we are and how we love.

Frederic (Bernard Campan) and Frederique (Lea Drucker) are a happily married couple who enjoy entertaining large groups of people at the country home where they vacation.  One day, Frederic invites their next door neighbor, a single gay man by the name of Hugo (Charles Berling), over for a get-together with family and friends.  Soon, Frederic and Hugo have struck up a friendship largely centered on their mutual addiction to running and their propensity to talk the night away over such weighty matters as love, passion, responsibility, freedom, commitment and marriage.  Hugo tries to convince Frederic that his role as dutiful husband and father has robbed him of his individuality and earlier lust for life, while Hugo, spurned by his father at a young age, comes to his own understanding of the importance of family by the end.  There's an obvious sexual attraction between the two men, but the movie goes far beyond the typical coming-out drama to explore romantic passion in all its myriad complexities and forms.

Frederic is torn between the desire to continue loving the wife who so obviously loves him and who has provided a stable home for him and their children - and this new found feeling for Hugo that he can, in no way, shape or form, even begin to understand.  The movie never feels the need to judge any of the characters; it presents them simply as well-meaning but flawed human beings who struggle on a daily basis, as all of us do, with an array of emotions, needs and desires that continually come into conflict with one another.

The screenplay by Zabou Breitman and Agnes de Sacy employs long, winding conversations to reveal the truths about the characters and the relationships that help to define them.  Moreover, the sensuous, bucolic setting, far from being a mere backdrop to the foreground action, actually serves to pull us into the lives of these people as they while away a languid summer swimming, hiking and exploring the inner workings of their own roiled psyches.

In his direction, Breitman has come up with interesting, slightly abstract ways of filming the commonplace details of everyday life, utilizing extreme close-ups, distorted angles, catawampus framing and mosaic-style storytelling to impart a lyrical tone to the film.

Superb performances by the three leading players also add greatly to the emotional richness of the piece.

With a great deal of insight and tenderness, ""The Man of My Life"" presents us with a subtly provocative, beautifully realized and psychologically complex view of the human heart.",1246060800,29,2755,5.00437636761488

3221223,5,B000WMEAPC,"...........or:  ""FRED DISCOVERS HE'S BEEN MISSING SOMETHING"" (alternate title for this review).

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-Addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

This is a love story.........a falling-in-love story. Yes, it's a love story, pure and simp.... Oh, wait, maybe it's not so simple after all. Why? Well, just think how shattering it must be to have spent the majority of your adult life in a happy and loving heterosexual marriage.......only to have another ordinary day come along, one in which you unexpectedly meet a someone of the same sex........and you suddenly face the beginnings of a new love. That's what this film is about, and the DVD back cover description of the story also lays it out for us in a nutshell:

{""While on holiday at his family's home in Provence, Frederic's seemingly perfect family life is disrupted when he meets his neighbor, a graphic artist named Hugo. Suddenly, Frederic's entire existence is thrown out of order as the two men develop an attraction to each other, both intelllectually and emotionally, which destroys the once perfect relationship between Frederic and his wife.""}

In this ""typically French"" film, we're fairly quickly introduced to two men: Frederic (""F""), a seemingly happily married man with a wife (Frederique), child and extended family residing in their vacation villa. We first see scenes not only of this fairly large group's family interactions, but also intimate interludes between just this man and his wife. Closeness, caressing and kissing abound in this couple's first scenes (but, wait.......we then discover that physical intercourse on his part seems to have become difficult to achieve). We then meet our second male lead, Hugo (""H""), a graphic designer who resides next door. He's an unashamedly ""out"" gay man who, through the course of the film, becomes as increasingly fascinated with ""F"" as Frederic becomes with him. ""H"" is a man who happily and easily frequents a local gay bar, as well as ""entertains"" a string of handsome young men in his home. One of the first times we and Frederic are invited into ""H's"" home/studio we are confronted by a stunningly beautiful, young god of a man----nude and seemingly levitated far above our heads in a semi-fetal, sleeping position. It is an image that any famed museum/gallery in the world would die for. It is later on in this same residence's main, living area walls that we will see projected an ever changing and increasing array of letters, words, phrases (apparently produced by the sun's light entering large windows on which these letters, etcetera, have been placed). They appear, move and fade with changes in the sun's position and brightness. We come to discover these words and phrases have originated in the two men's second meeting-up, at a family party, followed by an into-the-wee-morning-hours, one-on-one conversation between just the two of them (Frederic's discovery of this wall projection phenomenon indicates to him the importance to Hugo of that first night's lengthy interaction between them). It should be noted that we visit and revisit this hours long conversation, which touches on life philosophy and love, at various points throughout the entire film. It's during these hours, as their comfort with one another deepens, that we watch as Hugo becomes more touchy-feely with Frederic, who himself becomes more comfortably at ease. In a revealing moment, we then witness their time together coming to its early morning conclusion, with ""H"" leaving for home, while softly voicing to ""F"" the ultimate in personal compliments. I must ask here what would be your reaction, dear reader, if your newfound, and liked, departing companion directed to you the words, ""You're devastating?"" Ah, yes.......well, for Frederic it obviously becomes the start of something completely new and different in his life.

Complimenting these intensely personal and emotional scenes, there is a stunningly beautiful progression of outdoor / landscape scenes, one in particular showing the two men on a morning run, with an ankle-injured Frederic being carried home on Hugo's back. ""H"" wends their way through a very large field of what appears to be blooming garlic (unusually lovely, to say the least), and then through a huge and magnificent field of sunflower blooms. Tellingly, ""F's"" arms are clasped around ""H's"" shoulders and neck, with the side of his face resting against the back of Hugo's head (and this is the scene unhappy wife, Frederique, sees upon their arrival at the villa). There shortly follows a quickening of the feelings between the two as we watch a recuperating Frederic, half dozing on a patio lounge chair, and then sensing the presence of another. He opens his eyes to a quietly arrived and serious faced Hugo. A smile slowly lighting his features, ""H"" utters: ""I came to see about you. I'll get back to work now."" The look of self-satisfaction then appearing on ""F's"" face tells us more than could a thousand words.

Perhaps the most significant indication of the depth of growth in the relationship of these two men occurs near film's end, upon Frederic's learning of Hugo's impending temporary departure from the area. Limping his way to seek out ""H,"" he finds him outside the area's gay nightclub. Responding to Hugo's questions, ""Why did you come? Why are you here? You want to tell me something?"" Frederic responds: ""You're leaving-----."" Frederic then approaches ""H"" to bring them standing as physically close as possible, forehead to forehead, eyes closed. After a few moments, Frederic turns suddenly and departs (it is this scene's DVD Chapter heading that the film director has labeled: ""In Love""----methinks she knows of what she speaks).

Moving on to other facets of this production, the film also contains any number of strange / unusual----and surreal-ish----scenes and camera shots, which include:

-- A weirdly located string quartet, set up and playing / practicing(?) at night in nothing larger than a tumbledown, yet strangely well lit, chicken coop (for want of a better description). The only viewing-in access to their performance seems to be a very small, dirty and opaque-ish window through which we see peering in at various times, first, the Halloween-like masked heads of children, then the head of ""F"" and, later, the side-by-side heads of both our male leads.

-- A nighttime village dance scene with that same quartet providing sensuous tango music for a beautiful young male / female couple's performance (scene later on morphs to that of a male / male performance to the same music strains).

-- A brief, close up view of slowly moving, crystal clear water in which only the long, very blond tresses of someone's unseen head are shown dreamily drifting and swirling (wife, Frederique's hair is of this color).

-- A late scene involving Hugo's standing before a gigantic, red door (he had earlier mentioned his family's home having a (normal sized) red one, so we do feel somewhat safe in concluding that this near end of film image relates to an earlier in life instance of his being kicked out by his own family----bet you have no trouble at all in arriving at what that resulted from).

-- There are other such unusual shots throughout the film, and if any of you out there is aware of their meanings, please feel free to provide your Comments in that area below. A strong wish on my part is that our lady director had taken the time in her DVD Special Feature comments to enlighten us in these matters (or, perhaps, her goal was for us to reach our own interpretations and conclusions). Additionally, there are things about the setup of this film that, to this viewer, are less than successful. There is an over abundance of scenes involving Frederic's extended family that seem virtually unnecessary to the progress of the film, chief of which are those involving possible rape of a young female. This scene definitely detracts from the forward progress of the film, as does the need for a couple of less than sensical family swimming forays.

Lastly, having just shortly ago spoken of Frederique (""F's"" spouse), this movie can be pretty much described as one, long downhill slide for her, emotionally and relationship-wise. Her last scenes are ones of frantic----and nude----ravings over her perceived connubial losses. AND, as to what Fred's future lifestyle plans for himself are, you'll have to watch this film and decide for yourself. To help you a little in doing so, in his last scene he does say to his sleeping small son: ""I'm wobbly, imperfect, broken pawed, heart-in-tatters. I love you, but know I still have to grow up. I'll come back. I'll come back to spar with you again."" This leads us to ask, at near middle age, what kind of growing up and finding out about himself does he still have left to do? Is he on the verge of departing.......and if so, will it be with someone?

So, dear readers of this page and viewers of this film, what do you think is the meaning of his final words........and what can they possibly portend for Hugo?

PS--Speaking of meanings, if you're wondering about this review's title (...little chair by the bed), you'll just have to check out the film for yourself. Happy viewing.

PPS--This film is becoming ""Addictive."" ***Other such habit formers:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-a-Question-of-Love/dp/B0008ENHXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just a Question of Love</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brokeback-Mountain-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JOFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-Culture/dp/B000R7G9JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy Culture</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Over-the-Guy/dp/B00005QAQD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Over the Guy</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Second-Skin-Unrated-Version/dp/B000088UZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Second Skin (Unrated Version)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-I-Love/dp/B0000CBL9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man I Love</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Latter-Days-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0002I84JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Latter Days (Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mudge-Boy/dp/B000EGEKRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mudge Boy</a>

The slow reveal of the main character's desire is brilliant. The axis that the whole movie turns on, and Bernard Campan carries the weight of the film admirably. With a story that is simultaneously tender and tortured in each scene, the director Zabou Breitman shows a deft hand in balancing the evolution of the three main characters. When the husband, the wife and the openly gay neighbour who arrives next door one summer, grow closer as the summer progresses everyone's charms are revealed in unexpected ways. The climax of the film was startling in its realistic portrayal of what would likely happen and the devastation it causes. Charles Berling is amazing in what starts out as a hard edged role that is softened by the end, to reveal layers of character that are unexpected. Truly a beautiful film to watch and a heartbraking story as it unfolds, from every angle.

3221288,3,B000WMEAPC,"This film attempts to capture in very artful, often pretentious passes, the unexpected and blossoming romance between a heterosexual French married/family man and the nihilistic, philosophical neighbor that he and his wife invite to dinner while vacationing for the summer in Provence. The acting is uniformly superb and the cinematography is exquisite: I watched chiefly due to the setting in one of France's most extraordinary landscapes.

The problem is that the characters are very thinly drawn, not especially engaging, and the premise is ... well, not convincing at all when you consider what the plot demands of the actors and the outcome of the story itself. What we have is an attempt to look with great melodrama and angst at what is basically a French straight guy (the character 'Frederic') developing a slight man-crush on the neighboring gay guy (the character 'Hugo') after a night of heavy drinking and talking about the meaning of life 'til dawn at the vacation rental in Provence.

That's the problem: I didn't buy the notion that this sort of post-drunken man-crush would really evolve into something earth-shattering with the Hugo character. It seemed a stretch, given the way the script was written. The emotions tossed about in subsequent scenes have an arbitrary, random, and almost self-consciously ""artsy"" character that detract from exploring this theme more convincingly and, as a result, my feeling about the ending/denouement was essentially, ""You're all a bunch of stressed-out French people who've had way too much to drink and gotten way too much sun while on vacation, like most people. Is there *possibly* a chance you're all freaking out for no compelling reason? Chill out, lay off the booze, take an aspirin and have a nap before you all have to go back to Paris or Toulouse and rejoin the rat-race.""

Anyhow, that's the ultimate impression I had, without giving any spoilers away.

A subsidiary plot-line involving the Hugo character and his dying father was a much more interesting idea and ought to have been the center of the story, with the tepid little Frederic/Hugo thing being a minor side-plot. But overall this was an artful little French movie with fine acting, interesting camera work, and ambient scenes of Provence that almost make-up for the half-baked storyline.

3221334,5,B000WMEAPC,"Visually, this is one of the most lush and beautiful explorations of the French countryside I've ever seen. It also captures the slow, languishing vacations of the French, the art of luxuriating in the moment that so many of us have long forgotten -- lazing by the river, slow picnics on the grass, strumming the guitar and venturing a tune, the long outdoor dinner table under the trees with guests of all ages, playfulness and compassion between parent and child...gaiety and wonderful exchanges, all-night, deep conversations until dawn. And then there are the relationships, slowly built through layers of sharing -- both pleasure and pain. There's the relationship of a man and his wife, played casually and authentically, between a mother and a jealous rambuctuous young son, complete with his hero cape, and then there is the husband's relationship with another man. The film allows the two men to explore the meaning of relationships and life with one another in long, complex conversations that gradually deepen toward their inward truths. If you're looking for titillation, this isn't for you. It's more about how people share (or don't share) with one another...about the sadnesses, hurts and failure that all relationships portend, but it's also about the laughter and playfulness, and sheer joy and comfort of togetherness. Like the river, slowly flowing onward, so do the relationships. The pure, unhurried luxury of this! Such sheer contrast to the frenzied, neurotic film making of Americans with all the gratuitous sex and shallowness. So happy and enriched to have had this experience.",1369440000,5,1603,5.217054263565892
3221335,5,B000WMEAPC,"""The Man of My Life"" is not what I've come to expect from a ""gay"" movie. The slow pacing, the surreal qualities, the idyllic setting, the alternately heated then meandering dialogue, and attractive cast all combine to produce a multi-layered slice of life of the various characters. The pacing was a bit too leisurely for my American tastes but after the first 20 minutes I found myself seduced by the lazy pace of families on holiday doing everyday holiday activities. This being a gay-themed movie, I confess I was on tenterhooks waiting for the two main male characters to ... you know. I won't ruin the ending by writing if my expectation was satiated.  Suffice it to say, ""The Man of My Life"" is joining my short (literally) list of superb gay-themed movies.",1364601600,3,763,4.7368421052631575
3221336,2,B000WMEAPC,"Ugh.  I really wanted to like this.  Looked unlike all the B grade gay films in the US.  Alas, it was French arthouse crap.  In your face stuff leaving little room for imagination and no subtlety.",1360281600,,196,4.361111111111111
3221357,5,B000WMEAPC,"A visually stunning and beautiful film with engaging dialogue. I was captivated from the very start, and although I had rented it on Netflix, I knew that I had to own my own copy, so I bought a copy on Amazon. The most memorable scene for me is the  scene depicted on the cover of the DVD case: the two men in a field of sunflowers, the one carrying the other after being injured ... and what you don't know is that the wife sees this from a distance: her husband being carried home on the back of another man. At that point, she ""knew""! What a beautiful, tender, and emotional moment. Few directors can create those authentic emotional moments of epiphany. The film is not completely linear in nature; some scenes are repeated, but with slight variations. You realize it is visual art, not simply straight  storytelling.",1359072000,5,821,4.54054054054054
3221358,2,B000WMEAPC,"The first 20 minutes or so of this film seem so promising, like one is watching a quality Academy Award winning picture. The opening cinematography and how the scenes are framed is visually engaging. Had this film been placed in more capable hands in the way of a director and a good editor, this could have been a stellar film. As it is, you have a film that is way too focused on trying to be artistic to the extent that it weights down the whole plot. Scenes move way too slowly and just when the dialogue gets interesting, the director cuts away to some contrived artistic element, whether it's showing the same scene over again (but from a different viewpoint) or showing some unrelated visual element. There is actually a scene where the director inexplicably focuses the camera on a vinyl seat cushion rising after one of the actors stands. Then there's the confusion of trying to understand which actor is speaking what lines when the director filmed the conversation from way too far away. This happens repeatedly throughout the film. (grade: 2.5 out of 5 stars)",1353196800,7,1071,4.702127659574468
3221359,5,B000WMEAPC,"I liked how artistic the movie was, but yes, the storyline did disappoint me. And I know some people will say I just didn't understand the concept, or the subtlety, or whatever. I did. What I do not get is why people think that for a movie to reach it's artistic peak, it must either be very sad, or must have an unfulfilling ending. This notion is mainly championed by suckers for pain and angst, who think life is incomplete without them. Now, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, because I enjoyed it and I advise others to watch it. I am merely pointing out that those people who praise the movie for ""subtlety"" either do not like happy endings, or just want to be among those who ""get it"". I am not one of those people; my life can be significant and beautiful without tragedy or suspense...",1344988800,,795,4.306666666666667

3221361,5,B000WMEAPC,"I ""happened"" upon this movie because it was part of the Amazon-free-streaming-with-Prime deal and because it was listed as gay-themed.  One of the developments in the last 20 years of Gay Lib (to use an old-fashioned term) is that there is now a wealth (a glut?) of gay-themed movies, most of which, IMHO, are like the majority of mainstream movies: fair to lousy.  So in part it was my lowered expectations that helped to create the sense of wonder and discovery that viewing this film brought.  It avoided EVERY cliche of the falling-in-love themed film (gay or straight) but was incredibly moving and lyrical too.  I'm afraid of putting potential viewers off by overpraising this ""little"" film, but for me, after one viewing it's a highlight of the past couple of years.",1341964800,5,773,4.833333333333333

3221363,4,B000WMEAPC,"I think the movie is beautiful, but it sometimes got lost in that beauty. The cinematography, while, beautiful, makes the movie drag a bit.

You know, Fred's character was beautifully played. As a gay man, I'm usually rooting for the man to leave the wife and find his true self -- the one he probably locked away because of responsibility -- but in this movie, I truly felt the pain the wife goes through. In all the ""gay"" movies I've watched, this is the first time I've felt that pain. And it made me cry.

One of the things I like about French movies is representation of real people and part of that representation is of their bodies. I never felt like the nudity was gratuitous. It was integrated into the lives of the characters and it made them more real to me.

Overall, I think this movie is great. The ending was dramatic, but in a subdued way. But if you are the kind of movie goer who likes action, even some action, then this movie might be a little slow for you.",1322697600,3,977,4.298913043478261

The characters change very subtly and it is easy to miss the nuances that make this film so wonderful.

8224071,5,B000WMEAPC,"A thought provoking honest film about what it is to have a open heart is the feeling I was left with after viewing ""The Man of My Life."" I love the title given to the film for it illustrates the multi-layered, archetypal nature of the film so well. I want to watch it again because of the gorgeous:  imagery; cinematography; repetition of imagery from various angles (unique!); music illuminating the feelings of the characters; art; power of the dialogue of the two main male characters; portrayal of boys - men in all their guises and levels of play and emotional vulnerability or lack their of..etc., etc. So many layers of richness to this film.
The film was directed by a woman which did not surprise me. Perhaps with the freeing of gender bias (the gift being given to all of us by the current generation) we will begin to see more films directed by men with this depth of beauty in the inter-related-ness of characters, imagery, music, ah the nuances are so many.... So much more to say about this amazing film. Just watch it!!",1519084800,,1034,4.589189189189189

I would not characterize it as simply a Gay film, although one of the three main characters is gay.  It is very well acted, and beautifully filmed.  It is definitely NOT a film for action lovers.  Is it TOO ARTSY?  You would have to judge that by your own standards.  Some of it did seem to drag a bit, and some of the artistic devices were employed a bit too frequently;  but there are enough moments of beauty and genuine emotion to make it all worth while.",1420502400,,581,4.26605504587156
