A widow with a young child teams up with a single black mom to start a business. The business is a success, but the black womans daughter wants  to pass for white, and the white womans daughter falls in love with her fiancee. Interesting plot, strong acting. The film is dramatic and highly interesting, but the ending is weak and fizzles out. Nevertheless, this is a movie worth watching.

Imitation of Life (1959)
The basic concept of this movie is the same as the 1934 version, but the plot is different with the widow being an actress instead of an aspiring businesswoman. In short, this movie is watchable and fairly well done, but every aspect of the 1934 version is superior. Watch both versions to compare approaches to making a film from a novel, or only watch the better version.",1480291200,,814,4.645833333333333

8496442,5,B006CEKYVI,"This disc includes the 1934 B&W original and the 1959 color remake. I strongly recommend that both of this movies be viewed in sequence starting with the 1934 version. Unless you're an old movie buff, most younger people will find the acting style of the 1930s awkward and bland by today's standards. However, the '30s version has more sentimentality and sweetness in my opinion, even if slightly overacted. The unfortunate maid character, Delilah, is played by the seriously underrated and stereotyped Louise Beavers, who, in my opinion outshines the headliner, Claudette Colbert. For initiators to movies of the '30s, I think you'll find the part played by Ned Sparks interesting.  If you watch the 1959 version after the original, you'll notice the story's structure is roughly the same, but character names and background scenario is quite different. Being in color and set some time after WWII, the acting has that ""modern"" touch which will likely hold younger folks attention better. But, Lana Turner's character comes off as bitter and scornful, while the part of her maid (Delilah in 1934), Annie (played by Juanita Moore) comes off a little weaker, although still the character to watch in the '59 version. The '59 version also has the often lifeless Troy Donahue and the perky and huggable Sandra Dee. Both are considered classics.",1522281600,,1341,5.095454545454546
8496443,5,B006CEKYVI,"1934 Version with Claudette Colbert, Louise Beavers,

Louise Beavers was amazing & deserved star billing with Claudette Colbert

Ned Sparks is very funny as the dry, suspicious, overly protective, business partner/accountant, Elmer

Heartbreaking story about a light-skinned young African American woman denying her mother and heritage because she wants to fit in with and be accepted as an equal by European Americans.  She has nothing to be ashamed of, especially not her mother.

Through an accidental encounter two widows (Bea played by Claudette Colbert and Delilah played by Louise Beavers) decide to pool resources that leads to both of them becoming immensely wealthy from the African American mothers secret recipe for pancakes.  In this case this Aunt Jemima is a symbol of pride, ingenuity, hard-work, and talent.

The ending is a bit contrived and disappointing

The racism of 1933 & 1934 is undeniable in so many ways.  Delilah automatically assumes a servile relationship with Bea.  Delilah continues to cook pancakes while Bea manages their joint cafe.  When they become rich, Delilah and Peola live on the ground floor while Bea and Jessie live on the second floor, a version of downstairs/upstairs.  It is just assumed that Peola will attend an all African American college in the South while Jessie attends some exclusive college not far from the Brooklyn mansion.  Delilah sits in the front seat next to the African American driver while Bea sits alone in the back seat.  Peola also sits in the front seat next to the African American driver while Bea, Jessie, and Stephen Archer (Beas boyfriend) sit in the back seat.",1506816000,,1637,5.128301886792453
