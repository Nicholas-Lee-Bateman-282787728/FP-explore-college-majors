8074449,1,B000A4T8LI,Was more of a narrative than a movie or play like I thought.  Would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.,1304899200,,109,4.190476190476191
8074450,1,B000A4T8LI,"One star may be a gift. I wish I had read the reviews before purchase. The film that cost at most $100 to make (LOL) centers around the kid with a very bad record but ""maybe innocent"" this time, the jury with a stereo typed group of bigots, higher ups, some jerks and a few average Joes that just want to go home.  AND of course, to have a movie ONE man that wants to analyze the facts. Lastly there is the minister who throws in semi meaningless ""words of wisdom"" some seem unrelated to the movie. You can figure out what happens before you watch the movie. TOTAL DUD!",1240012800,4,569,4.172727272727273
8074451,1,B000A4T8LI,"I do not even know where to begin. The story takes place in a courthouse. A young man is awaiting a jury decision throughout the entire movie. He and his grandmother are located in one room in the courthouse and the jury are in another room weighing out all the evidence against the defendant. Between scenes, the movie jumps back and forth to a young minister preaching in a church. All you see is him at the pulpit and everytime they jump back to him, we have to listen to at least 5 min. or more of us sermon. It is really redundant. This is a terrible, low budget movie, and a total waste of money. It is not even fit for the dollar movie. Don't waste your money.",1239753600,8,667,4.178294573643411
8074452,3,B000A4T8LI,I was shocked that the message in this production was so good. Although the storyline is lacking some substance,1223942400,2,111,4.894736842105263
