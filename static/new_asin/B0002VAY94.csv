8032764,5,B0002VAY94,"This is truly a bitter sweet remberance for me, as I was lucky enough to have known Buddy, and his work for many years. He was one of the most singularly prolific talents of the cabaret genre, who quite literally seemed to know every song ever written. His performances were a real treat since you were never really sure of what he was going to do, musically or otherwise.
This recording captures him in the prime of ""his"" performing life, as he also was noted for accompaning such luminaries as Mable Mercer. But here is Buddy, in fine voice, and in fine company; Sylvia Symms was a dear friend of Buddie's, and his cohort in this performance.
This tape is truly a keepsake for all those who admired the talents presented here, and those who are fans of cabaret. ENJOY!",1350000000,,770,4.507142857142857
