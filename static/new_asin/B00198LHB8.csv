3428096,5,B00198LHB8,This DVD shows all of the Holiday Movies during the 1950's 60's & 70's.  I liked this DVD because it brings back Memories when I was Little.,1382400000,2,140,4.185185185185185

3428098,1,B00198LHB8,"This is not the Jimmy Durante Family Favorites but another similar Holiday compilation which I have received three times saying it was the Jimmy Durante, but definitely not.  That is why I am displeased.  I am sure this one is excellent but not what I wanted nor ordered.  Can someone help me get the correct DVD I have wanted since Christmas 2012.",1362441600,,348,4.580645161290323
3428099,5,B00198LHB8,"One of the best collections for less!  There are a few weird cartoons/shows that feel like they don't belong, but I couldn't see knocking it down a full star for that.  There is sooo much more on this than the other Christmas Cartoon Classics Collections.  Plus a fireplace video!",1361404800,,280,4.673469387755102

3428112,4,B00198LHB8,"A great variety of old classic Christmas cartoons and movies. These are not the first rate-movies, but the nostalgia of these are nice. I haven't had a chance to watch all 4 DVD'S, but what I've seen so far has been very enjoyable. Most of these cartoons and movies are from 1940's - 1970's, are in BW/Color, and the picture quality is clear.  I am happy to add this purchase to my collection of Christmas DVD's.",1357344000,,412,4.421052631578948

3428114,5,B00198LHB8,This dvd brings back so many memories of the good old days and the many fantastic Christmases we use to have.  I espeically loved the vintage cartoons.,1356220800,,151,4.592592592592593
3428115,1,B00198LHB8,"My wife picked this up at Walmart for $5.  I suspected this was one of those collections of D movies that no one has ever seen before.  I came here looking for a review/confirmation of my suspicion.  But there was none.  Then I saw 1 single movie title I recgonized, Santa Claus Conquers The Martians.  It was a movie I watched as a little kid in the 60's every Christmas season.  I decided for nostaligia sake I would waste the five bucks and open the DVD.

O M G.  It was so much worse than my worst expectation.  You can't even call this stuff campy, it's just bad.  Sometimes things are so bad they're funny.  This is just bad.  Nothing funny here.  Just old crappy movies from the 40's & 50's& 60's. (I'm surprised there isn't a silent movie on here), and lots of bad bad bad bad acting.  The cartoons are all from the 50's, and may I say, bad bad bad.  I got to see my first Howdy Doody episode, a Christmas one.  All I can say is, simpler times; and ouch, that was bad.

One good bonus feature, a virtual fireplace fire.",1354320000,,1027,4.184615384615385

3428117,5,B00198LHB8,Got this DVD for my grand kids and they enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again. I was surprised they especially enjoyed the B-W movies and TV shows.,1348012800,,149,4.172413793103448
3428118,4,B00198LHB8,"If you want the ultimate in vintage holiday fare, this is your DVD. There's a lot of fun, cheesy, classic holiday movies as well as cartoons. This will bring a lot of memories back to the Baby Boomers! The picture quality isn't always the best, but you can't beat the price.  It's a real bargain because you get a lot of shows in this collection. Hopefully these films will get restored to a more pristine picture, but until then, this is a good collection to own. Once they get restored, the DVDs will be much higher in price, so if you want a lot of good, clean family fun without the expense, pick up this set for the holidays or all year round.",1328140800,18,648,4.2682926829268295
3428119,1,B00198LHB8,"Sure this isn't overly expensive, but it isn't worth even a few dollars.  The re-recoding of this DVD was done poorly.  Not only is the sound bad with frequent echoes and distortion, but the voices are also off.  Some of the B&W episodes are green and gray rather than black and white.  Additionally, the DVD often skips and freezes up.  This could have been a fun collection, but is instead frustrating to watch and nearly impossible to listen to many of the movies.",1292889600,3,467,4.578313253012048
3428120,3,B00198LHB8,"It's not that this is a terrible video for it is not.  It is a good one....sort of.  Most of the cartoons were so depressing, I didn't feel like it was the Christmas season.  All I wanted to do was go to sleep when it was finally over!  The shows were fine, but not as pleasant as that other videos I bought that day!",1292716800,5,317,3.90625
3428121,1,B00198LHB8,"My parents had just bought this set of 8 dvds. Now granted, there is a LOT on here.... but it's not good quality.

I've got the cartoon disc on right now, and it's all off colored, skipping, with really bad quality. It looks like someone taped them off tv and then transferred them to dvd.

Or maybe the production value was just really that bad.

It's all public domain, so you're getting exactly what you paid for. The only good thing on this disc is the original Rudolph cartoon, and even that seems like it could have gotten a better treatment.

If you want good cartoons, stick with the ones you know. The stop motion Rudolph, Charlie Brown, and The Grinch will be the ones your kids want. Not this.",1256342400,19,704,4.392307692307693

8272877,5,B00198LHB8,"Found this exact same item at a local store and purchased it for a very comparable price. Only interested in the collection because of the inclusion of one of, if not the worst Christmas movies ever made, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"". I remember seeing the original in the theater when it came out, and transfer quality is definitely not an issue here, as the original theater print was just as cheesy looking as is this modern day copy. For me, it brings back the memories of how exquisitely awful the movie looked even when it was just released. Enjoy it for being hilariously awful today and the fun times at the movies if you ever enjoyed going to the Saturday matinee around this time of year when you were a kid.",1418860800,,725,4.5

8272879,3,B00198LHB8,"For this bargain, this five disc DVD set features all the cartoons and film shorts on the first disc. The film quality is not high standard or restored.

The second disc features the worst Christmas movie ever made: ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians."" This film is one of the worst movies ever made. Some might want to see to get laughs or make fun of it.

The other films include Nancy Marchand's television debut as Jo March in two episodes of ""Little Women: Jo's Story and Meg's Story."" Conrad Bain also appears.

While it took me awhile to watch all five discs, I did enjoy it for the holiday season. If you don't mind the poor quality since they were not preserved properly over the years. I'm sure viewers will be nostalgic for the cartoons and films as well.",1391472000,,766,4.496402877697841
