3736217,5,B001OSC4FG,"I had purchased Mindy's previous DVD...Supercycle..also a pretty good DVD if you are short on time...

But this is amazing!!!! You have 3 workouts... Hills/Flats/Intervals...each one challenging in its own way...

Mindy makes sure that your pacing is right...posture is correct...and the scenery is refreshing.

Her passion for fitness shows...as well as her knowledge...

You can create your own workout..including warmups...unfortunately its not as complete as some matrix type set ups I have scene on other workout dvd's...but if you have a DVD remote ...there is no reason to get up out of your seat...transitioning is easy...

I've been challenging myself with two of the three workouts on a daily basis for the last 7 days...which works out to approx 50 min of work out...and 10 min of cool down...

Ive lost almost 1.5 inches in my thighs already..the workouts are hard!!! if you push yourself to the limits..and Mindy reminds you of that...

I've haven't made it to doing all three workouts as yet..which should be approx 1.5 hrs...but I'm very excited to have a DVD where I can even plan for that...

Check out the price...it could of been sold for $60..and it would of still been worth it...

Mindy's DVD's are never cheesy...motivating and realistic...always...

I hope she keeps on coming with hard hitting..lengthy challenging workout DVD's..from beginner to advanced ....this will become your favorite!!",1246579200,30,1417,5.175438596491228
3736218,4,B001OSC4FG,"Just received this DVD and like it much better than Mindy's Super Cycle video.  There are three separate workouts: hills, intervals, and flats.  You can also choose a combination of any two or to do all three.  The main menu also allows you to choose just the warm up, the workout, or the stretch from any of the three but doesn't allow you to set up a combination and then run the program like some other exercise videos.  So if you want to do a combo, you have to get on and off the bike to choose the next segment.  Mindy has the decency to look like she's working hard too.",1237766400,5,577,4.162162162162162
3736225,5,B001OSC4FG,I love this spinning dvd workout it has alot of variety so you don't get bored doing one thing. It's also short if you just want a quick spin for the day and are short on time or you can combine them to make a longer workout. Got item in expected time frame.,1392163200,,258,3.8867924528301887
3736226,5,B001OSC4FG,"I like Mindy! She's spunky and makes the workout enjoyable. I typically use Bike-O-Vision videos, but like to switch it up and watch this video to really push myself in a shorter amount of time.",1391385600,,194,4.571428571428571
3736227,2,B001OSC4FG,Didn't love it prefer DVDs which actually have a class going on. I will keep looking for another style more like the gym class.,1389571200,,127,4.333333333333333
3736228,5,B001OSC4FG,"I thought mindy created a great video for a variety type workout. U can do them all or just part of the DVD. I thought she gave great instruction... I know others said she talked too much, but it was ok. I learned a lot and it helped me get more out of my ride. Thanks!",1387584000,,269,3.8214285714285716
3736229,1,B001OSC4FG,Bought this for my wife. It was pretty much riding a stationary bike and seeing someone else actually get somewhere.,1376006400,,116,4.85
3736230,4,B001OSC4FG,"This is first CD I have purchased with spinning workout, therefore I cant compare with any other workouts. However I am very satisfied and I do feel like I am getting enough from each session.",1372291200,,192,4.514285714285714
3736231,5,B001OSC4FG,"I am a spin bike neewbie I bought this DVD based on the reviews.
I realy do not have anything to compare it too but it is very easy to follow and she makes the workout intense if you need it or easy.
Some people have said she talks way to much but I think she is very motivating and she is really working hard.
Over all I am very happy with the workout and the way its formatted.",1369180800,,379,3.810126582278481
3736232,5,B001OSC4FG,I bought spinbike because of my work hours and wanted to get that same gym feeling and this tape is actually better than instructors that I have had in spinclass and if one workout not enough you just keep tape rolling and do a double or triple workout its all up to you and your goals.,1368748800,,286,4.125
3736233,3,B001OSC4FG,This video is decent. I am a female triathlete and I was looking to do spin class in my house on my trainer.  That's what I got!  The workout is hard and it's nice that you have 3 to choose from.  Sure the music is not tops but I hardly noticed cause I was too busy sweating my but off and cursing the instructor which is what you do in a good spin class right?  I'd buy it. It's worth it for the money.,1365379200,,403,3.761904761904762
3736234,3,B001OSC4FG,"This is good, but to me was very boring.  However, as far as these videos go, this is the first one I have ever purchased, so don;t have a lot to compare to.  I think my next purchase will be more of a ""spin class"" type video, with higher energy.",1364947200,,246,3.9
3736235,4,B001OSC4FG,"I bought this on a whim, looking for something to keep me cycling inside.
I was very surpirsed at the amount of advice as well as the workout series.
I would buy this again",1360454400,,172,4.088235294117647
3736236,5,B001OSC4FG,"I had only ever taken two spin classes in a gym before receiving this product as a gift-I have been using this DVD for about a year and am happy with the quality and length of the workouts. I turn the music option off because I do these exercises early in the morning, and don't want to wake anyone up.  Without fail, each of the three workouts gets endorphins pumping through my system every time I do them.  I use the video at least 3-5 times per week.  I would, without question, recommend this video.",1356220800,,504,4.28421052631579
3736237,4,B001OSC4FG,Offers as advertised video motivation to hit the spinner.  But we have not found it to be very inspirational.  Could do just as good watching TV while spinning.,1356048000,,160,4.678571428571429
3736238,4,B001OSC4FG,This DVD is great.  You have a lot of different options.  You can mix and match your workouts.  This makes for a different work out each time.  The workouts are burn about 300 calories every 30 minutes and each work out is about 30 minutes including warm up and cool down.  The only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars is because the music is not that great.,1347494400,,364,4.070422535211268
3736239,5,B001OSC4FG,"Fun and a awesome workout.  I alternate this and running for my aerobic workout.  Mindy is a great instructor, she keeps it very motivating.",1345248000,,140,4.791666666666667
3736240,1,B001OSC4FG,"Bought it for my wife, she took many spinning classes in past so i thought it would be a great gift, well after she watched the video she told me it was very genaric and not worth what ever i paid for it. NO i would not purchase again!!",1336089600,,236,3.836734693877551
3736241,4,B001OSC4FG,"Flats, intervals and hills: each 30 minutes long, just great if you don't have enough time and still feel you got a great work out.  This is like a spin class but focused one of three aspects in a class.  Nonetheless, you still get a decent work out and you can link two or all three of the work outs together!  Great for beginners.  The music is in the background,  not instrusive and she does like to talk - not annoying.",1325289600,,423,4.172839506172839
3736242,5,B001OSC4FG,"I was looking for a different workout in Spinning.  I wanted something for the extra burn and to experience a different type of ride.  The fact that you can pick your own ride, change up the ride all on one DVD, is great.  If you want a good change of pace, then this DVD is for you.  I have been Spinning over a year now and found the DVD challenging and different.",1323475200,2,366,4.041666666666667
3736243,2,B001OSC4FG,"I was excited to try this but once I did, I realized that I wasted my money. This is so boring!!!! And the backgroung music is uninspiring. She also keeps on talking, talking, talking......I strongly recommend this for elderly folk, say 70 and over.",1323043200,4,249,4.681818181818182
3736244,2,B001OSC4FG,The video tape was defective. I was riding along with the tape and it stopped and then jumped back to an earlier position on the tape.  The tape then continued from that point.  I could never get the tape to complete to the end of the ride.  I will not buy any of her tapes again.,1322352000,,280,3.9642857142857144
3736245,5,B001OSC4FG,"With the warm up and stretch, the rides are about 30 minutes long.  Good for a fast, sweaty work out",1318982400,,100,4.0
3736246,5,B001OSC4FG,"I just got my indoor bike and decided to try this video. I had no idea of which video to buy. I read the reviews and I found mixed comments. Therefore, I decided to just choose a DVD and give it a try. I'm glad I bought. It is helping me to build resistance on the bike and is not boring. As a beginner, I recommend this DVD.",1318291200,8,325,3.7941176470588234
3736247,5,B001OSC4FG,"I truly enjoyed this DVD.  Mindy is engaging without being too chatty.  She motivates you and really gets you to zone 1, 2, 3, or 4.  I enjoyed being able to choose which workout on any given day.  You have the choice of 3 different workouts (flats, hills, or intervals).  Mindy LOVES the intervals, as do I! Each workout is challenging in its own way.

As a new spinner, this DVD challenges me and I forsee this DVD one of my favorite ""go-to"" DVD's for a fun yet difficult workout.",1315267200,2,482,4.3
3736248,2,B001OSC4FG,"This video was pretty disappointing. The music is bad, the scenery is cheesey, and the ride overall is boring. It was tough to finish the first ride and I haven't watched it since; I'd rather direct my own ride with music that gets me pumped up! It is nice that you can mix and match rides, but it's very choppy and not well edited. Wouldn't recommend it, but I'm sure it works for some people.",1312416000,3,394,4.266666666666667
3736249,5,B001OSC4FG,"I've been working out at home for years and I must say that so far, of all the workouts in my library, this is the toughest one. I tend to do the whole workout at once (usually takes an hour and a half), but for beginners or people who don't have much time, doing it separately works as well (especially the hills section). I've used Mindy's Super Cycle, which can be done in less than an hour, and highly reccommend it too. Anyone who has used the Spinervals series will be able to notice the difference since Spinervals is more focussed on training/preparing for outdoor cycling. Tricycle translates into better outdoor performance as well, but it's definately tougher in my opinion. I can only ride outdoors once a week, and still keep up with people that ride 5 times/week! Best workout for your money. Mindy rocks...",1311638400,2,821,4.63013698630137
3736250,1,B001OSC4FG,"Dont waste your money, this video is super boring and she talks throughout the entire thing. I ended up muting it (there is an option to turn talking off) and turned on my iPod instead.",1311379200,2,185,4.314285714285714
3736251,5,B001OSC4FG,"I love this DVD.  I wish I had only purchased this one DVD and saved my money on all the others.  I love her attitude and you work hard.  This DVD is designed so that you can make each workout your own by using segments from flats, intervals and hills.  Choose which segments you want to use depending on your level.  Or, just workout to the full workout for intervals, flats or hills.  It is a smart format.  Love, love, love it.",1309305600,,430,4.170731707317073
3736252,3,B001OSC4FG,Too much talking before each work out once is enough!! Great work out but the music is boring not energizing at all!!,1304035200,,117,4.363636363636363
3736253,4,B001OSC4FG,When you are done with this workout your heart rate will be up and you will be soaked. Great work out. Makes me feel good! The sound on this video is too low for some reason. You really have to crank up the volume. I returned the 1st one and the second was the same.,1301270400,,266,3.8545454545454545
3736254,1,B001OSC4FG,My husband and I bought this DVD and another one featuring Mylrea.  The instructions are not clear when she says what to do next.  She talks too much and music isn't very good.  She has annoying movements with her arms.  We probably won't use either DVD again.,1280966400,,260,4.468085106382978
3736265,3,B001OSC4FG,"This DVD was just okay.  She pretty much tells you what to do and you work at your own resistance and pace, but it did not have the feel of the spinning classes in the gym at all.  I think it's because she talks too much and the background music is a little corny.  You can get a good workout following it though.  The mix and match features are good, but when you combine the workouts, you have to go through the warm up and cool down of both.  If you have a controller and can fast forward the cool down parts, then that's good.  I have to play mine on a computer, so I had to stop pedaling.  It would be nice if they cut the videos up for the mix and match workouts so there is no pause in between.  The cool downs are just okay...I prefer my own kind of stretching.  I will continue to use the DVD to get the basic workouts, but plan on making my own workouts with more motivating music.",1278892800,6,891,3.9887005649717513
3736266,3,B001OSC4FG,"This DVD Trycicle: Pick Your ride Cycle with Mindy Mylrea is a real workout.  However, it is not for a beginner which is what I wished I knew.  She doesn't explain enough when you are a beginner.  Therefore, I would only recommend this for advit cyclers.",1276473600,6,254,4.478260869565218
3736267,5,B001OSC4FG,"I love this program.  Mindy Mylrea is by far my favorite spinning instructor.  I have bought every spinning DVD I could find by her.  Her videos far excel what is on the market for spinning.  She makes spinning fun, challenging and you really feel energized and good about yourself at the end of the program.  She also breaks it up into sections so you can do the entire video or mix and match.  The best spinning work out you can find in my opinion.",1276300800,3,450,4.2976190476190474
3736268,5,B001OSC4FG,"This is a really great video. I like that it gives you options for doing the workouts separate or together. I have a spinning bike at home, but it doesn't have a computer on it so videos that tell you to go a certain cadence aren't very good for me. Mindy gives you 4 zones to find and gears the workout towards that. I have two of her cycle videos and will most likely buy more.",1272240000,,379,4.0
3736269,4,B001OSC4FG,This DVD is fun to keep you motivated while you spin.  She has a nice personality and the scenery is very beautiful in the background.,1268870400,,134,4.36
3736270,5,B001OSC4FG,"Great DVD for the money.
Never took a professional spinning class but this DVD really gets your heart rate going. Every workout is about 26 minutes with warm up and cool down.",1268006400,,175,4.5
3736271,5,B001OSC4FG,"I spin bike just to get into shape.  This DVD is great!  You can just spin for about half hour from hills, intervals or flats or combine two or three of the segments for a longer workout.  Each segments have there own warm up and stretching at the end.

I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to get in shape",1265155200,19,322,4.145161290322581
3736272,5,B001OSC4FG,DVD is a good investment for use with the spinning bike...teams up for a great workout!  Recommend it!,1264982400,,102,4.666666666666667
3736273,5,B001OSC4FG,This is a very good product I have used it three times and enjoy all the different levels and combinations that can be made.  I would suggest it for anyone who has been to at least 3 spin classes because she does not cover bike fit or basic spin technique.  But otherwisae offers workouts that can be great at any level.,1260316800,16,320,4.229508196721311

8331376,1,B001OSC4FG,"Really a lousy excuse for an instructional spinning class.  It looks like Mindy drug out a spinning bike to the beach, turned on some music and then blabbered on endlessly.  You can barely even hear the music!  If you want to have a motivating DVD, try out the indoor world tour DVDs or even Cathy's.",1468627200,,300,4.418181818181818

I've been working out to these videos for a few years and still haven't gotten tired of them.  Good workout!",1399507200,,377,4.23943661971831
