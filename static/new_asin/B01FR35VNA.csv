8761229,2,B01FR35VNA,"The film opens with a botched exorcism.  We then move to establish the character of rich guy Jesse (Justin Burford) and his multiple poor friends. His sister was kidnapped when she was 10, some time ago. People start to die mysteriously around Jesse which also attracts the attention of the police.

On the plus side of the film is the good cinematography,  scenery, and drama scenes that look good because the supernatural scenes look so bad. The special effects had a distinct amateur low budget effect, while the rest of the film looked professional.  The drama scenes were hit and miss with the really bad scenes being when Jesse was alone with Jo (Andrea Burdett) while a sappy piano was playing.

If it is possible to kill a dead language, the Aussies managed to achieve it in this film.
