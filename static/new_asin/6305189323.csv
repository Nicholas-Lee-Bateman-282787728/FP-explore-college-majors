985668,4,6305189323,"The great french master Rene Clair directed this movie when he was in exile in Hollywood. Dick Powell (who is slightly aged at this point; his  haydays as a baby face was in the thirties) plays a news paper editor to  whom, by some miracle, somebody put's the next day's paper in his pocket.  In stead of telling this story as a fairy tale, Clair choses to direct it  as a screwball comedy. And his sense of mad-cap comedy is as zany as in his  more famous French films such as in Le Million, Les Belles de Nuit, making  it a quite an enjoyable comedy with certain philosophical (but never  serious) undertone. The tape is made from a beautiful print restored and  preserved by UCLA Film-TV Archives.

985760,5,6305189323,"It Happened Tomorrow is a fine motion picture with lots of action and the surrealistic qualities of the plot enhance the film a lot! The story moves along at a good pace; I was never bored. The cinematography and the choreography both reflect careful forethought. The musical score enhances the film, too. I must add that Director Ren Clair made this all work so well; this could have been too surrealistic or some type of boring melodrama. However, with Clair's touch the film springs to life as an engaging story with action, some suspense although the beginning shows how one part of the plot will work out--and you will enjoy plenty of laughter, too!

Although the film actually begins with a 50th wedding anniversary party for Larry and Sylvia Stevens (Dick Powell and Linda Darnell), this short party sequence is really just a way to create a flashback that runs throughout the entire motion picture--until  the very last minute, that is. In the flashback, we quickly meet young reporter Lawrence ""Larry"" Stevens drinking beer with his peers at the newspaper office where he works. At the same time, old ""Pop"" Benson (John Philliber) lectures Larry, who would love to know the future to get stories before anyone else can, that knowing the future isn't necessarily a good thing even if Larry could use it to make some ""scoops"" in the paper.

Later Larry and his pals stop off to see magician Cigolini (Jack Oakie) and his clairvoyant niece Sylvia (Linda Darnell); they are a phony psychic act but the audience loves them! Larry is smitten with Sylvia and asks her to have lunch with him the next day. When Larry is finally walking home, ""Pop"" Benson mysteriously appears to give Larry a newspaper--one that turns out to be the paper for the following day! The paper reports on a robbery and Larry, on his date with Sylvia, captures the story fast! Unfortunately, Larry also gets the unwanted attention of the police who arrest him and Sylvia! The police believe that Larry and even Sylvia were involved in the robbery since Larry knew about it beforehand and Sylvia was with Larry at the time of the robbery.

All of this leads to an enormous chain of unexpected events--for example, Larry is stuck at the police station and how he gets out I won't tell you; but he does become a hero just as ""Pop's"" next paper says he would be! However, when ""Pop's"" third paper predicts the winners of the horse races--as well as Larry's untimely demise--Larry marries Sylvia; goes to the racetrack where it seems the predictions might not come true--and Larry remains desperate to avoid The Saint George Hotel where the paper predicts he will be shot to death!

The plot is actually somewhat more detailed and of course even more things happen; but I'll stop so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the action shows how everything plays out and there are quite a few surprises.

Look also for good performances by Edgar Kennedy as Inspector Mulrooney; Sig Ruman as Mr. Beckstein; Ethel Griffies as Mrs. O'Connor, a boarding house tenant and Luis Alberni does a great job in his cameo role as a restaurant owner.

It Happened Tomorrow is terrific for fans of Director Ren Clair and the actors in it; people who enjoy dramas with elements of comedy and surrealism will not be disappointed.",1365292800,,3330,4.711340206185567

Rating: 3 1/2 stars

I saw ""It Happened Tomorrow"" quite a long time ago when I was young and my memory of it was that it fell into the fantasy genre category, akin to a Twilight Zone episode. Having just seen it again at the ripe old age of fifty-eight, it's quite clear that the 'fantasy' element is probably the best aspect of the narrative, but truth be told, this film is primarily put together as a romantic comedy. It's a charming little film with a strong Act 1 opening and a very engaging Act 3 climax. It only falters during the long-winded second Act, where some of the comic digressions fall flat.

'It Happened Tomorrow' is at its best when the reporter protagonist, Larry Stevens, charmingly played by Dick Powell, encounters 'Pop Benson', the mysterious old man (winningly played by John Philliber) who provides Larry with tomorrow's newspaper. Ironically, Philliber died the same year (1944) the movie was released. And here he plays a character (who we learn at the end of the film) has been handing Larry the newspapers after his purported death, shortly after offering up some enigmatic comments on the nature of time to Larry and his cronies down at the newspaper office.

You'll notice that director Rene Clair doesn't have Larry discover right away, the fact that the first newspaper Pop has given him, is from one day in the future. He cleverly has Larry's acquaintance in the restaurant read the weather report, indicating unseasonal snow in May. Then Larry realizes just what Pop has given him when he looks through the restaurant window, and discovers indeed that the snowflakes are coming down in May. The acquaintance has been looking for a job and runs over to another restaurant only to find a female employee denying that her boss is looking for new help. The acquaintance stalks out, leaving Larry witness to the firing of a 'butter fingered' dishwasher, confirming that indeed the boss had placed a want ad in tomorrow's late edition.

The next sequence is even more exciting. After making the acquaintance of love interest Sylvia Smith (played by Linda Darnell who is saddled with a completely pedestrian part), Larry brings her to the opera where he knows from the newspaper that a robbery will take place. Director Clair displays his craftsmanship by showing the robbery through the perspective of the round glass windows inside the theater where Larry and Sylvia are standing, watching the opera. Only after the robbery is over does the camera zoom in to capture the police mop-up operation (the same technique is used in Act III after the shooting in the St. George Hotel).

Things slow down considerably in Act 2. Larry is accused by the police inspector of being an accomplice to the robbers and too much time is spent having Larry continually deny his guilt while the others, including the inspector (along with Larry's boss) remain incredulous in the face of the unlikely story Larry has been trying to peddle.

There's more long-winded stuff including too much time spent at the nightclub with Sylvia trying to pass muster as the resident psychic for her uncle, the great ""Cigolini"", played by an over the top Jack Oakie. Larry doesn't actually take possession of the second late edition; Pops merely relays information through Larry's jail cell that he's called a hero, for attempting to save a woman who jumps off a bridge. It turns out Sylvia is trying to make good on her prediction back at the nightclub that a woman will indeed jump off a bridge that evening. Before the big 'surprise', we're treated to a decidedly unfunny sequence where Sylvia, having been forced to wear Larry clothes after getting her dress drenched in the river, must break into her own apartment and fend off a gaggle of octogenarians, who believe they've witnessed a burglary in progress.

Things really pick up again when Larry reads his own obituary in the last edition he manages to obtain from Pops. After getting married, there's a great scene at the race track, where Larry picks the four winners, only to appear more and more gloomy after each victory (note that after the third horse wins, Larry sits cross-legged, totally dejected which mirrors his same pose following the shootout at the St. George). Larry believes he has a short respite after the fourth horse is declared a loser, only to have his worse fears confirmed again, after the winner has been disqualified.

The climax is filmed as an exciting chase sequence. I don't know which actor played the man who stole Larry's race track winnings, but he is truly menacing as a determined criminal. Larry and the robber face off inside a stairwell, on a rooftop and then finally inside the lobby of the St. George Hotel where Larry manages to dodge bullets flying in every direction. The money aptly disappears and Larry and Sylvia manage to walk off without a twinge of regret that the money was never recovered. The worst thing that happens is that Larry's colleague is unable to prevent the false news report of Larry's demise ending up in the evening paper.

While I didn't care much for the awkward 'anniversary' opening and ending scene, Larry and Sylvia's ""B"" story as well as Uncle Oscar's and Inspector Mulrooney's bumbling machinations, there is something downright neat about the idea of a man who reads a report of his own death in tomorrow's edition of a newspaper and can't decide whether he should try and prevent what supposedly is meant to be or simply accept his fate.

'It Happened Tomorrow' is a charming enough fantasy to hold your interest despite the distracting presence of low grade slapstick humor, typical of the romantic comedies of its day.",1307577600,5,5696,4.837782340862423

The movie does not disappoint with it's great writing, acting, and now infamous plot.  Regardless of the show, the movie stands well on it's own.

What I wanted to make sure intrerested consumers were aware of was the DVD itself.  The quality of the print is fantastic with very few artifacts.  The audio is excellent with no noticeable drop outs or clipping.  Sadly, there are no extras.  I only gave 4 stars for this reason...",1211587200,,575,4.308411214953271
985764,4,6305189323,"Rene Clair's lightness of touch and subtle humor enlivens this slight fantasy-comedy with numerous small pleasures.  Observe, for example, Darnell's sly takes during her ""mind-reading"" trances.  Or Powell's wry reactions during the film's final minutes.  Or Jack Oakie's manful wrestling with various accents (his natural lisp usually wins out).  Low-key and endearing, in a pleasing transfer.",1157328000,3,393,5.964285714285714
985765,4,6305189323,"It Happened Tomorrow is like the pre-decessor for the TV show Early Edition. It is about a newspaperman (Dick Powell) who tells an old man in the records department that he'd give ten years of his life to see tomorrow's newspaper. In fact, he does, for three days, and what he sees isn't necessarily great news. There are plenty of twists and turns in this film, telling us and Powell that what appears to be the case might not always be the truth.

Powell is wonderful in this movie (with a moustache!). Not only is he great in the leading man spot, he's very funny too. He is the perfect blend of the guy next door and the hero-type, making him easy to relate to and interesting enough to want to watch.

Costarring Linda Darnell as Powell's love interest and Jack Oakie as her protective uncle, this is a fun example of a lesser known gem of Hollywood.",1149379200,7,855,4.405063291139241
985766,2,6305189323,"A silly story of a newspaperman (Dick Powell) who is miraculously given tomorrow's newspaper for a few consecutive days and, ultimately, has to prove that the report of his death is greatly exaggerated.  IT HAPPENED TOMORROW is a comedy that isn't all that funny and a work of speculation that isn't all that compelling. Powell proves that he can't grow a moustache and looks bad in circa 1905 clothing.  Fans of Jack Oakie can expect a couple of chuckles, Linda Darnell is beautiful.

Watch the 1944 movie with Dick Powell and Linda Darnell. We have seen many versions of the same story and can get jaded. The story and even many of the elements are predictable.

On the other hand the movies were well presented. All the actors have chemistry. We have fun with the not so secret twists and turns.

A new paper team has fun speculating on what it would be to see the future. Would you want to know when you were going to die?

One reporter falls in love with a fortune teller and they predict that they will make their 50 year anniversary with all their relatives about them.

7884895,4,6305189323,"1944's It Happened Tomorrow caught Dick Powell in flux. Powell was at the stage in his career where he'd had it with portraying the featherweight musical-comedy crooner. He was desperate to tackle more dramatic roles. He wanted his screen persona to transition to a place where the plot wasn't airy and where Busby Berkeley wasn't around dropping crazy choreo around him. And, after It Happened Tomorrow and the equally frivolous Meet the People, he'd do just that, taking on hardboiled private eye Philip Marlowe in Murder My Sweet later on that same year.

The newspaper from the future isn't so original a plot device. John Buchan's 1932 novel, The Gap in the Curtain, and Robert Silverberg's 1972 short story ""What We Learned from This Morning's Newspaper"" are only two bizarre tales in which characters caught a glimpse of time-displaced periodicals. It Happened Tomorrow itself would inspire the CBS television series Early Edition.

Helmed by acclaimed French director Ren Clair during his extended stay (1935-1945) in Hollywood, the film reacquaints him with the fantasy realm he explored in The Ghost Goes West (1935) and I Married a Witch (1942). And while It Happened Tomorrow was never as heaped with kudos as were those other two, it was well received by the masses and killed at the box office. Me, I liked it because Powell's my guy and I harbor fond memories of Linda Darnell from The Mark of Zorro and because paranormal plot points like the newspaper from the future never fail to hook me in.

***Plot SPOILERS in the following paragraph***

In the 1890s, restless obituary writer for the Evening News Lawrence Stevens (Powell) receives a newspaper that presents him with the following day's headlines, courtesy perhaps of a phantom archives clerk (John Philliber) who also warns our guy that with such foreknowledge: ""My boy, every day of your life would be poison."" Stevens applies his insider knowledge to suddenly rake in scoop after scoop, only to get nicked by that double edged sword. His uncanny prescience earns him the fish eye from the blustery police inspector (Edgar Kennedy), seeing as how Stevens seems to be suspiciously in the know regarding a certain hold-up at the opera house during a concert. On the third day, he reads his own obituary...

If you prefer your whimsy and your old-fashioned charm and sly misadventure served up by the French, then this one should do ya. It's been years removed since Clair turned heads with his inspired French comedies - Le Million (1931), Sous les Toits de Paris (1930), A Nous la Liberte (1931) - yet he still exhibits that same deft touch. No, It Happened Tomorrow doesn't quite rest near the top of his body of work, but that is a lofty tier, yo. Suffice it that this slice of otherworldy Americana transports you to an engrossing world of make-believe in which sentimental romance wars with the incomprehensible forces of fate. There's a vague sense of unease, a Twilight Zone edge that clouds the surface frivolity. It's played for laughs, but there's a despairing undercurrent in how Stevens tries to fend off his doom long enough to secure a future for the girl he loves. Powell, the actor, is caught between preferences. His novice reporter has more substance than his earlier ""juvenile"" roles but isn't as gritty as his future noir roles. Powell is supported by a good cast, namely Linda Darnell as his sweet-natured paramour (who happens to be a sham clairvoyant) and Jack Oakie who nabs the biggest laughs as her blowhard uncle, him very much complicit in the charlatan psychic act. And because it's a French guy what's driving this bus, expect also, along with the madcap antics, a measure of innocent titillation brought about by gross comical misunderstanding.
