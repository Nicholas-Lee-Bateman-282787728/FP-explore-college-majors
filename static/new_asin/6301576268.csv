7813876,3,6301576268,"I presume that this edition is special because it is highlights from the original, as it only runs 30 mins. However for such a short running time it  does manage to cover 16 victims of scandal and tragedy in a reasonable  fashion - ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Roman Novarro, Sharon Tate, Sal  Mineo, Rock Hudson, James Dean, Jayne Mansfield, George Reeves, Freddie  Prinze, Lenny Bruce, Vivien Leigh, Montgomery Clift, Errol Flynn, Tyrone  Power, Bela Lugosi, and Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer. This material is  similar to the Hollywood Babylon books and series which expose the  underbelly of the showbiz capital. It makes no pretense of representing  these people as actors or even try to analyse their appeal as stars. Their  infamy is based on their private exploits. Consider Vivien Leigh's triumph  as Blanche Du Bois, doubly difficult since she had to better her Scarlett  O'Hara, and then see how she is reduced here to a tuberculor tramp,  scouring the London streets for any lowlife to satisfy her appetites. Even  the mention of her Blanche is accompanied by the wrong still (we see her in  The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone). The narrator (who hisses his words in  disdain) offers his aesthetic rationale, without apology. We are told that  some of the more ""exotic"" details exhibited may be considered by  some in poor taste, or insensitive to the memories of the celebrities, but  one must remember that these accounts remain the final signal that each has  left for posterity. Whether you find the Rock Hudson or Tyrone Power jokes  amusing probably depends on how low you are willing to submit yourself,  though the comment that Linda Evans condemned Hudson for their Dynasty kiss  after he had been diagnosed with AIDS, is plainly untrue. Of note is the  nude picture of James Dean with an erection, sitting in a tree, that was  used in Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean, and here  covered by a red circle titled ""censored"". Perhaps the red circle  does not appear in the full edition.",966816000,,2002,4.831858407079646
