8027833,5,B0002FIJTC,"In ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE KILLER- BORIS KARLOFF, the boys find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation in the hotel in which they work. Of course, they must get to the bottom of things, and hilarity ensues, as the bodies begin piling up! Just about everyone seems suspicious, especially the mysterious Swami Talpur (Karloff). KILLER could have also been called THE OLD DARK HOTEL, since the set-up is similar, w/ a rogues gallery of suspects to choose from. Boris, as always, is magnificent in his creepy role, and Bud and Lou are in rare form. One of their best films, rivaling any of their monster movies. Highly recommended...",1495843200,,646,4.828828828828829
8027834,5,B0002FIJTC,Its a great movie but here Boris Karloff does not play Frankenstein but a completely different character and does not play a major role.  As usual Abbott acts dumb but Costello acts dumber.,1485216000,,189,4.7272727272727275
