3886622,5,B002AMUDK8,"I never made it to New Orleans.  This show made that lack so poignant.  The show was beautifully written, well-acted, great visuals, and the music was incredible!  I love all the new (to me) music this show introduced me to.  I wish it had gone on.",1277337600,43,248,4.326086956521739
3886623,5,B002AMUDK8,There really isn't anything else to be said. This is the best TV show or movie ever shot in New Orleans. Ever.,1276560000,30,110,4.045454545454546
3886624,5,B002AMUDK8,"The premier episode, ""Do You Know What it Means"", is a work of art.  It will easily bear repeated watching because of its outstanding writing and masterful use of the indigenous music.

Not to mention the great acting, many levels of meaning, clever cameos and true-to-life subplots.  And most of all: a major media production has finally ""got it"" about New Orleans, and got it right!

The entire series is ""a love letter to New Orleans"".

3886625,3,B002AMUDK8,"I was starting to get into the storyline when I suddenly realized that not one of the actors (thus far) has that authentic New Orleans accentthey, in fact, sound like a bunch of damn yankees!

What a damper!",1499644800,,207,4.447368421052632

3886627,2,B002AMUDK8,"I couldn't get past episode 3.  I wanted to like this, but couldn't.
I was interested because it was advertised as being from the people behind ""The Wire"" but haven't seen anything beyond two actors and a similar propensity for profanity to connect the two.  Around 1/3 of each episode is devoted to the music of New Orleans, which is fine if you like it, but if you're not already a fan, it drags the show down.
Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's definitely in my top ten worst TV shows list.",1496707200,,503,4.28421052631579
3886628,5,B002AMUDK8,"Treme, HBO's TV series is Pure joy -- if you play music you'll love it! If you play horns you will be in heaven. Treme's a great, fairly true, gritty story about New Orleans, focused on the Katrina time period, with rich, eclectic music, oozing and busting the seams of the interesting storylines. It taught me about sub-cultures I wasn't familiar with. A social justice/injustice narrative that showed how corrupt officials and moneyed interests benefited from the loss and displacement of New Orlean's lower income people. Many of the ethnicities of New Orleans -- Creole, Cajun, Indian, Black, White, etc., and their music, dance, costume, food, are highlighted. I especially loved old N.O. funeral music and contemporary N.O musicians that I'd not known. One of my favorites was the exquisitely photogenic Lucia Micarelli, who played Annie in one season. She's a Bronx-born, half-Korean,half-Italian, accomplished violinist, whose ""Annie"" is a street fiddler. I also liked the wonderful cover versions of some old pop and rock, going way back. You'd hear a full, 10-piece brass band, just messing around, doing something that sounds SO, SO familiar. What was it?  Oh, it was Parliament's ""Knee Deep!"" Then five minutes later, you're hearing horns playing a Rolling Stones song. But then you look it up and find out that the Stones had really covered an old blues when they first recorded it. Almost as interesting were the good, non-horn covers. LIke rule-breaking DJs going for mood, the audio segues are deliberately uber-overlapping to enhance the sound-fest and story. So, if you like blues and good old-school R&B, with a sprinkling of jazz, Treme is the place to be. Director David Simon (The Wire) has done it again. Several of The Wire actors, like Freemon and Bunk, have important roles in Treme, and outweigh the somewhat annoying characters sometimes essential to films and TV. Most the musicians are the real deal musicians, playing themselves: Trombone Shorty, Alan Toussant, Dr. John, Kermit Ruffins, Irma Thomas, and many more.. Wendell Pierce (The Wire's ""Bunk"") had to be taught how to make realistic slide motions to look like he was really playing in the series. Khandi Alexandar, who plays Pierce's ex-wife LaDonna, kills it!",1491350400,,2249,5.144808743169399

3886675,5,B002AMUDK8,this is certainly something of a different nature. seeing how things were after Katrina. I know its not real but I believe it is based on actual happening.

3886762,5,B002AMUDK8,"This is possibly the most amazing real drama HBO has ever put on air.
The show makes one laugh and cry in approximately equal proportions. There is no ""main"" character, and the whole story line is about Katrina aftermath, i.e., the main character - if any - is New Orleans, here portraited to perfection, with respect and realism. I would give 10 stars if I could!",1470700800,,364,4.53030303030303

3886767,4,B002AMUDK8,"If you get confused by the short scenes in Season 1, watch on. It's confusing for the first hour or so, but that's because there's a rich collection of characters, each with a backstory that will emerge in subsequent episodes. And eventually the lives of the characters intersect in various ways, making this a complex, engrossing work that tells an important socio-political truth about a tragic event (Katrina and the aftermath) while showcasing some of the finest music in our country. The music is not incidental to the plot, which makes this an even more engaging story. Couldn't wait for the next episodes!",1470268800,,612,4.951456310679611

For example, Chief set up ""shop"" at that bar, like it had been his before, but then the owner shows up and they act like they were being thrown out of HIS place!  If going to spend all time cleaning, fixing up, go to your own place start there!  Then when he was home, going through papers, found something like an ""ah ha"" moment started entering figures into the calculater, never was clear exactly WHAT HE WAS DOING AND WHY!  Then his claim appointment, was not clear what he was there for????  But he had all papers, huh!?  Where did the papers come from?  What did he get?

Also, when you are rolling beginning credits, stars... Put a picture with name, so people can get to know these real life actors by photo and name!  Like having a CD and no list of songs on CD, just blank, maybe who's released it name, but nothing else!  I just don't buy those blank CD, because I want list of songs ON ACTUAL CD!

It is way different in the difference of the city, and also that it is very much experienced through the music. Many famous great musicians appear and play here, intermixed with actors. And it seems some of the actors are also musicians, like the character Annie played by Lucia Micarelli, who a fabulous violinist. You can read up on how various characters were based on real life characters in New Orleans.
 I agree with other reviewers that it takes time to get into it. I watched in small segments like 30 min at a time, so I'm not sure, but it took me a while to get to the point where if I had to stop I couldn't wait to continue. But somewhere after the middle of season one I was engrossed, and by the end of season one I was totally smitten and couldn't wait to continue with season two.
This series is musically fantastic, refreshingly politically astute, and as it goes on with the lives of its various characters it gets into you.",1454284800,2,1100,4.314009661835748

Having been back to New Orleans shorty after Katrina hit and again a year later, I know the depression people had, and how our government let them down. New Orleans has a culture unique to any other area in the US. And even though I don't live there any longer, that culture is part of who I am and I wouldn't change it for anything  This program brought me joy in hearing the music and brought me to tears many times. New Orleans people of all colors are unique and are also survivors.
 This program showed both the good and the bad and I thought it did it rather fairly.  Hated for season 4 to end.",1447891200,,673,4.114503816793893

The info about Katrina and its just as disgusting aftermath makes me ashamed to be a US citizen.  Will we never wake up to the importance of people's lives and our culture, especially the debt we owe to New Orleans? The acting and writing are excellent, as is the music.  So many notable cameos.

3887094,5,B002AMUDK8,"One of the best shows ever. A nice way to get some exposure of the great music from there. I love that some many real people are in the show. I just watched it again starting on the 10 year, I don't what to use the word anniversary that is not the right word, after hurricane Katrina. The loss and the scandals after the floods are the other reason to watch this show to learn more about what happened. The personal storied wrapped around real events make it so real.",1444867200,,467,4.2

3887135,5,B002AMUDK8,"I have just returned from New Orleans, where I asked people whether they perceived Treme to be authentic, and they all answered with a resounding YES! It is a marvelous show peppered with the rich and colorful multiculturalism of NOLA. I found the first few episodes a bit confusing until I came to know and understand the characters, which happens more and more deeply as the show progresses. The marvelous music and musicians of New Orleans are everywhere in the show, to my great enjoyment. It is both heart-breaking and heart-warming to see how the people in the show deal with the tragic legacies of Katrina--their strong sense of humor, their ironic, almost fatalistic, acceptance of ""what is,"" and the strength of their communities shine through clearly, as does the clear joy most of them experience in the small things of daily life. You cannot get to know NOLA by hanging out in the French Quarter, but you can get to know much of its depth and diversity by watching this outstanding series!  It has made me fully understand why so many people refused to give up on New Orleans when so many others wanted to--it's all about the culture and the sense of true community.",1443225600,,1178,4.718446601941747

3887138,4,B002AMUDK8,"I like this series and it's great to see a lot of the actors from the Wire; however it just doesn't seem to have the passion of the Wire.
The wire's genius was in demonstrating how the institutions of society failed the people of West Baltimore. What made that show relatable is that those institutions have failed the poor in other American cities too. Treme is more specific to New Orleans and that makes it harder to relate to for me. Perhaps Treme is more about when the opportunity not only to underserve the poor, but how to make them someone else's problem when the situation presents itself.",1443139200,,599,4.555555555555555

But there is a reason why Wendell Pierce is so often mentioned first among the cast - he is exceptional - so authentic and charming.  Season one is also notable for the role played by john goodman - the great writing has me missing him through season 3 .  Melissa is another exceptional performer.",1443139200,,413,4.527027027027027

Hearing familiar sounds & seeing familiar places and faces (I have a number of friends in the series) was truly a blessing at times I was more lonely than I could've ever imagined.

I really love the music and the insight into the lives of musicians.  The story line is poignant with interesting social and political issues explored.  I also like that there is not a lot of violence and what there is is not gross. Only 4 stars because it can be a bit depressing.,1442188800,,459,4.428571428571429

3887173,5,B002AMUDK8,"Absolutely top notch series that looks at post-Katrina New Orleans from the vantage point of its rank and file cultural exponents. Suburb, writing, acting, and directing that captures the essence of the Crescent City's unique musical and culinary contributions to the American landscape in a dramatic and humorous manner that is most captivating. Most of these series devolve into poor soap operas after season two, but Treme stays on track through the entire run of programs. Television has seldom produced anything this noteworthy, and I feel that this is required viewing for anyone even remotely interested in New Orleans. Watch it, it will make you laugh, sing, dance, and cry.",1441843200,,682,5.209090909090909

I like the introduction of real life figures into the story, such as Kermit Ruffins, and John Besh to name just two of the more well-known people, as well as many heretofore unknown (uncredited?) locals.  It's also interesting that some of the characters from different story lines eventually interact, if only tangientially, making New Orleans seem like a small society.  The city's problems post-Katrina were/are certainly intricate and not easily solved.

3887198,3,B002AMUDK8,"Slow .. not much of a plot .. but I do like most of the music!  This series depicts residents in Treme as mostly lazy pot smoking, drinking musicians and partiers that would rather listen or play music than to help clean up the extreme mess. This series also depicts the residents in denial of the circumstances and their viewpoint that they are entitled for the government to handle their problems for them. Furthermore they are unable to handle the change that Katrina did to their property and lives!  ""Screw cleaning up this mess .. let the government do it all .. feed us .. clothe us .. pay us and shelter us .. while we all get drunk and party!"" (This is how the series portrays the situation whether it is fact or fiction) .. For me, it is very irritating since I have to actually work for a living!",1441584000,,807,4.337748344370861

3887223,5,B002AMUDK8,This amazing series left me hungry for more.  The characters are real and engaging and the story behind their stories of a city struggling with corruption and Inadequate resources while some folks are profiting handsomely off the suffering of so many post Katrina is a story all Americans should know.  This series made me go to New Orleans and see for myself.  I fell in love with the city and with Treme and was lucky enough to see some of the filming of one episode.  I just wish there were more seasons.  A truly great and unique blend of human interest and political commentary with a musical backdrop that soars and inspires.,1440979200,,631,4.598214285714286

I'm not a fan of who they have as the main characters...I'd prefer them following the musicians more and the female chef.  Still don't know why she'd be with the obnoxious loser character.  It's a little tricky to understand some of the dialogue too.  It's nice to watch for ""free"" with my Amazon Prime account as we got rid of premium channels when this first aired.

Well not having cable, let alone HBO, for at least 5 years, I never got to see it. Until recently. I looked it up on Amazon Prime video and there were 3 seasons!!! So excited, I began watching. Now I am absolutely hooked. It is very powerful, very informative, and very layered. The story lines are rich, provocative, and anything but generic TV. The music is captivating - it pulls you right into the magic. It awakens one to the reality that music is the life force that pulses through the veins, the hearts, and the souls of these people. This series takes you into the nooks and crannies of real lives and the stories we in the north never heard. I am ashamed that I knew so little and I know this is just one simple slice of what was a far greater tragedy in reality than can ever be shown on a tv show.

I was disappointed in John Goodman's character's exit from the show and felt that there was only a tenuous parallel with The Awakening by Kate Chopin.

Blake Leyh, the music director deserves kudos because this show has the best music I have ever seen on a TV show, with oh so many performers doing live /on screen spots, like John Boutte, Irma Thomas, Alan Toussiant, Lloyd Price,  and many many more.  A huge cast that includes Wendell Pierce, Clarke Peters, Steve Zahn (Go UKats), Kim Dickens, John Goodman, Melissa Leo and David Morse, all are great. This series is simply great,  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1435968000,,809,4.76978417266187

The characters. Too many of them seem to be two dimensional. If you didn't read the books written about Hurricane Katrina, this show does a pretty good job of giving you a primer on what went on during, and in the first few months after the storm.  That said? This is one of those shows you'll watch once, and not really want to re-watch.",1434931200,,510,4.451612903225806

3887543,4,B002AMUDK8,"Based on the previews and the screenshot I thought this was mostly going to be about the Indians, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It covers many different aspects of New Orleans culture as well as brings to light the struggles that resulted from Katrina.

The series, for the most part, avoids the extremely predictable ""drama for the sake of drama"" plot lines that plague so many TV shows.  Most shows nowadays are so predictable that you can figure out how the whole episode will play out within the first 5 minutes.  This one definitely doesn't do that.

It ended leaving me wanting more, instead of carrying on until you lose interest, but didn't leave me feeling like there was anything unexplained.",1431388800,,705,4.793388429752066

3887599,5,B002AMUDK8,"The thing I loved about Simon's other big project, The Wire, was the sense in which all of the characters--cops, drug dealers, students, politicians, everyone--were playing against the same unseen antagonist. Maybe you'd call that antagonist the American class system, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, or the Status Quo,; its effects were inescapable, but seldom did any of the characters seem to fully grasp the enormity of what they were up against. At the same time, their common struggle against the unseen antagonist was what gave every character such depth, and made everyone's actions make a certain kind of sense, in a way that very few television shows, and certainly no cop drama, have ever approached.
There are similarities between The Wire and Treme, for sure; in terms of structure, there's again a large ensemble cast of complex and fascinating characters, and thematically, again we see a fearlessness in portraying how race and social class are lived and understood. And again, there's the sense that all the characters are living their lives in the shadow of another dominant, yet unseen character, only this one has a name: Katrina.
The main difference between the unseen antagonists of The Wire and Treme is that in the Baltimore we see portrayed in The Wire, the sense is that the Status Quo, with its class contradictions, its crushing poverty, and its political opportunism, has always been grinding on in the background, always exerting itself on a largely unwitting cast of characters. Most of those aspects are also present in the New Orleans of Treme, but in the latter series, all of those contradictions have been violently churned up in the single catastrophic event of Hurricane Katrina, and all of the characters are literally and figuratively picking up the pieces, and sorting through the wreckage. Meanwhile the man-made catastrophe of capitalism, and all of its crushing social, economic, and political relations, churns on.
However, this is anything but a network franchise: Treme is not The Wire: New Orleans. The similarities, and the differences, are more in the deep background, and are largely more felt than seen or heard. Simon, the production crew, and the cast bring Treme to life through deeply delving into the characters and their setting, feeling their way through the difficulties that post-Katrina New Orleans (and America) imposes on them in diverse and authentically human ways. And damn, man, you can't say enough about how the music and the culture sustain people, and give them a sense that they have something worth fighting for. While I'd love to see a series come along in which the characters caught up in this intolerable Status Quo grow past merely adjusting their lives to it, and actually try to come together to overthrow or otherwise totally transform it, a series like Treme in the meantime gives us a lot of political, social and artistic raw material to feed and fuel our thinking in deep ways.",1428278400,3,2968,5.059183673469388

The most interesting story line in my opinion was the lawyer trying to find the brother.  The rest of it was just observations on people and their struggles from an outsider's perspective.  I truly did not feel any resonation with John Goodman's character.  And his summit at the finale was bizarre and rang hollow.

I'll watch the other season to see if it grows on me.  It wasn't bad.  It just wasn't as engaging as I would have expected.",1426636800,,569,4.394230769230769

3888032,4,B002AMUDK8,"NO has been a city of extremes til it became the Big Easy. The mixed cultures and races with mixed legal underpinnings created a weird unwritten rulebook of acceptable and dangerously unacceptable behavior. Weird seems to be an appropriate word for the City. Dance all night at Tipitinas and stagger home or to lodgings and little more than snickers and thumbs ups from job bound commuters. Beyond this easy life there is a police force as unreconstructed as any to be found in the South. The unwritten rule book is as opaque as any Rosetta Stone or Enigma machine might be. That police misunderstand the rules  is no mystery. That application of rational interpretation, of the laws, of common practice and adherence to the written word, is unpredictable is part of the mystery of NO. This was told, but unexplained, by a great soul at her  second floor apartment of the Upper Pontalba. At the end of the conversation, she lifted her arms, wrapped  in the folds of her dressing gown, and shrugged her acceptance and acknowledgement of the mystery of NO.
Viewers of Treme would do well to remember this review.
The program is of a reality that exists in few other places. It is a good view or vision of moments. Watch the surroundings carefully. Life changes by yards, if not feet and the boundaries shift.",1419897600,,1306,4.719298245614035

The era of the movie is certainly one that sill go down in history, and no one should ever discount that time.

Really loved this and just kept binge watching.  It caused me to look up quite a few things about the culture and post-Katrina events.  As far as I could tell, this show really captured the city and the aftermath of this devastating storm.  Can't wait to see season 2.  Exceptional performances by John Goodman, Wendell Pierce, Khandi Alexander, Clarke Peters, Steve Zhan, Melissa Leo, Kim Dickens and many more.  Absolutely loved seeing all the real musicians performing throughout.  I learned that Wendell Pierce learned trombone for this.  As a jazz musician, I have to say, he really pulls it off.  Lucia Micarelli is just incredible playing violin (her main gig!) as well as her acting.  Michiel Huisman is also a real guitarist/pianist and really convinces us he's a street musician.

3888472,5,B002AMUDK8,"The real life story of an American disaster and how it personally impacted the people in Louisiana, specifically New Orleans. A compelling, heart rending, celebration of the perseverance and strength of the folks who gave the world jazz and swing. The same folks left to rot by an indifferent (or inept) government.

It's a poignant and bare faced look into the cultural and societal influences that continue to birth great music from New Orleans musicians. One received well by the locals which is the most critical acclaim possible for a TV show based on a real event in a real place.

Every episode is alive with music and brings you into the neighborhoods where jazz was born and the real culture of New Orleans lives. IF you never knew what New Orleans was about, this show gives you an understanding of what you don't know.

Major themes are rebounding from Katrina, government and police response, Mardi Gras, food, and always, the fight to retain cultural identity in a time of outside money and development interests. Throughout the series heavy hitters make musical appearances - Dr. John, Fats Domino, Irma Thomas, and Trombone Shorty, to name a few. Kermit Ruffins is featured prominently every season. Ellis Marsalis makes an appearance in a later season.

All the main characters are compelling and some of the actors backstories align somewhat with their personal histories. Kim Dickens, Janette, is from Huntsville, AL where she's from in Treme. Michiel Huisman, Sonny, is from Holland, as is his character. Wendell Pierce, Antoine, is from Pontchartrain Park and went to school with Wynton Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr.

This is a keeper. I'll buy the series on dvd or blu ray.",1411689600,,1695,4.954225352112676

3888532,2,B002AMUDK8,"""Won't Bow. Don't know how"".
How about ""Won't work. Don't know how""?

I watched Season 1 and have no intention of getting the other seasons. Yes, the show seems decent (judging by just the first season), but it has many flaws... mostly due to the dump it's set in and the incessant ""music"" that plays throughout each episode. The fact is that unless you are a native of New Orleans, which thankfully most of us are not, you won't give a crap about this show. Treme was created by the same guy who created a far better TV show called The Wire. Why he bothered making a show about what is essentially nothing more than a giant cesspool filled with some of the laziest and most useless people in the United States is beyond me. And this is reflected well in the characters in Treme, who seem less interested in earning a living than they do in holding a stupid parade for whatever stupid reason they can think of, making silly costumes for themselves, whining about how ""poor"" New Orleans was neglected, ignored, and rejected by the rest of the country, and so on. Plus, Steve Zahn's character was incredibly annoying!

New Orleans was and still is a s**t-hole known only for one single street and for being or having been the murder capital of the USA. New Orleans has very little significance in American history and its impact on culture for the entire country (and elsewhere) is virtually non-existant. That bayou noise they refer to down there as music is nothing more than a variation of the blues and jazz... both of which had originated elsewhere in the USA. As for the cuisine, it's just food with some spices... whoopy!",1411257600,,1626,4.584192439862543

Orleans to watch the documentary first. I thought I understood what went down there but was blown away by the information provided by the documentary.

Now for the show.

This is a beautifully written tale of residents in N. Orleans post Katrina as they struggle to revive their city and rebuild their homes, lives and families. Its a smart show with really impressive character development; you really learn to care about these characters who are WONDERFUL.  And don't forget about the music and the city itself, the show is so smartly written that both the music and city become characters of their own.

The storyline performs a variety of functions. First of course its the story of people like any other show but you soon realize that its also a vehicle to highlight why N. Orleans is important to America at large. The show is infused with the multi-faceted living traditions and cultures that make up N. Orleans most of which you would never even know existed.  Then the story delves into the failure of the city, state and federal government to address disaster problems before they happen, as they happen and after they happen. This show mostly deals with the incompetence post-disaster. Now it may seem to some that these issues are only typical of N. Orleans because of the scale of damage but I lived through Super Storm Sandy where the bottom half of our house was damaged and though it was nowhere as catastrophic as Katrina some of the same problems ensued ie. FEMA's often ineffective insurance policies, people unable to move back into their homes, businesses closing because they have no help to reopen post-disaster, adding economic and employment challenges to already compromised areas etc.  This should concern every American since global warming ensures that storms will become stronger causing more damage, creating environmental refugees and destroyed communities. You can ignore Treme's message if you want but a catastrophic storm could be headed your way any day now and you would feel very intimately how the loss is much more than just material.

Another theme running through this series that affects ALL Americans, is the commercialization of culture and its erosion of a unique, organic living culture and traditions. N. Orleans is one of the few places in the US that has a real living, breathing cultural heritage full of ritual and tradition non-existant in most of the US. Its not a slight against other parts of the country, I just noticed that I hadn't seen a display of such a unique living culture since I was in South East Asia. The N.Orleans tradition goes way beyond ""mardi gras"" and Bourbon St. This ruination of culture has happened to cities such as NY except it happened more stealthily without the aid of a massive storm. The replacement of real community culture and tradition for a monetized culture is happening everywhere in the US and soon all we will have to show for it is the kind of culture provided by corporations. Food chains replacing small local restaurants, entertainment completely monetized and controlled, the loss of control by local communities to decide local ordinances.

I could go on and on about this show but the best way to get it is to watch it. You won't be sorry. I was left with such a wonderful positive feeling after the show because it reminded me of everything that brings value to life, all the things worth fighting for.

It was an amazing viewing experience.",1409270400,,3709,4.8283464566929135

Like a gumbo, there are several competing storylines, and some ingredients are not fully ""cooked.""  i.e the Dutch singer/piano player sings off-key, and his jealousy towards the really talented fiddle player is annoying. Some scenes (like John Goodman's tirades) drag on a bit, others seem cut short. I like the inclusion of many New Orleans natives into the mix.

Last season, I couldn't stay away from ""True Detective"".  A recent film, ""The Normal Heart"" was honest to the bone and nearly did me in.  I look forward to ""The Newsroom"" later this year.  And I salute ""Treme"" for bringing the clear and deserved anger and rage of the citizens of New Orleans as first, Katrina -  and later, big business developers - sought to remove them from their homes and neighborhoods.  At the same time, they gave us many visceral reasons New Orleans is the iconoclastic place that it is, bathing us in the history and the current strength of jazz.  Kudos to all involved.

3888879,4,B002AMUDK8,"Good show.  A very authentic portrayal of life before, during and after the Hurricane Katrina had on the city called 'the Big Easy"".  All the race conflicts, the bureaucratic blame game, the political posturing, plus the neighbor helping neighbor humanistic ventures, but most of all the survival of the music. When in all society conflicts, disruptions, political posturing, survives despite them all---and in spite them all.  Think, You work, strive to get ahead to buy certain things, to be able to buy the kind of school education you want your kids to have, invest your money properly, then retire comfortably....ain't that the American dream?  Well, guess what?  While you were so busy making a life, you forgot to participate in one, probably two:  Yours and those of your children wants and dreams. If you as parents focused solely on making sure your kid had a JOB, a job NOT to be as an interim towards their dream goal, but a JOB that would ensure their biological needs were met---then you as parents have FAILED!!!!!!  You encouraged that they be as you: compliant. complacent, adherent, grateful for hard-fought amenities, who's only final wish is to buried in the family plot. What kind of life is that???",1405900800,,1220,4.921951219512195

It was so exciting to me to see folks on the show that I had actually seen up close when I was there.  I binged on the entire series over the last two weeks and I am down to two final episodes in season 4.  I was able to view the first 3 for free with my Prime membership.  So I had no choice and found it well worth paying for the final chapter.  I have fallen in love with many of the characters and I did not want  Treme to end.

3888931,5,B002AMUDK8,It was a great depiction of America at one of her lowest points since I have been alive.  Drawing back to the power of Sophocles the people represented all aspects of New Orleans (our most complex city) in the aftermath of a storm that showed peoples in difference to the struggles of an amazingly resilient people and culture while not down playing the trials and tribulations.  Going the Greeks one better we can relate to the characters as they are not just hallow lessons to be learned.  I am saddened that it was not more popular because in so many ways New Orleans represents one of our last stands against the homogenization of America.  We have long since lost the true Manhattan as individual institutions fall by the way side to gentrification (witness CBGBs - Colosseum book store and now J&R) and SF to the yuppies that have taken over the Mission District.  So would have liked to see more support to a city that values culture and a way of life more than air conditioned soulless chain restaurants populated by people who like the food the same be it in Des Moines or NYC.  In short watch it and weep.,1405555200,,1115,4.522388059701493

3888981,4,B002AMUDK8,"This was a very good presentation of events that happened in New Orleans after hurricane Katrina. It illustrated what the good people of that city had to deal with because of the political corruption that was prevalent. It was only recently that Ray Nagin was finally convicted and sentenced on corruption charges. Hopefully, any others involved either have been or will be held accountable for actions. It was good to see that Galveston's damage from hurricane Ike was at least acknowledged.
As the series developed it became more and more about the jazz music that could only have developed in an environment like New Orleans. Some of the episodes in the later seasons was more music than a development of the storyline. This was handled much better than Glee in presenting the music. Where possible the original artists who were instrumental in developing jazz were used. After watching this series (pronounced Tre-may) I have a better understanding of what Mardi Gras, second line, etc., is all about.
There were times I thought it was going to degradate into a soap opera but the series avoided that by moving the storyline very slowly and majoring on the performers and their music. In fact, if you want to avoid the story and just listen to the music you will not miss much.",1404950400,,1281,4.827272727272727

If The Wire is about the death of an American city, Treme looks like it will be about the re-birth of an American city.

It's not supposed to be a page turner like The Killing, The Wire, or Breaking Bad.  This show enchants rather than addicts.

It's easy to love Rob Brown as Delmont Lambreau, and Lucia Micarelli as Annie.

And watching the guys from The Wire play completely different characters is uplifting and it sometimes helps me understand the role of a soul in a city.",1404864000,,556,4.455445544554456

Brings awareness to the fact that too many politicians are more concerned about re-election than they are about meeting the needs of the people. Also identifies some of the questionable decisions that the government makes.

I am saddened that although the ""tourist"" areas have rebounded there are still great strides to be made out in the poor neighborhoods.

Treme does as good a job as it can though to portray the trials of different characters as they desperately try to put their lives back together again.  We saw the pictures and felt the horror of our government's failure and the resulting devastation created by the storm but the press and the public soon put those thoughts to the back burner as life went on.  Treme brings it back as it should.  We must never forget what happened there.,1403308800,,577,4.466666666666667

The real star of this amazing series is the music. I feel like I was present in those clubs and experiencing the struggles and the successes of NOLA musicians with them. So many issues are covered in this well-written and well-acted drama: corruption, drugs, families, career struggles, relationships, politics and more. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen and I re-watch episodes often. Let me just say that it is a program for adults - raw language, some sex, drug use, some violence - but it all serves the plot; nothing gratuitous. If you want to see what makes the people of New Orleans great and what it's like to try and resurrect an important city after a catastrophe (Hurricane Katrina and the Corps of Engineers-made), check out this show.

3889196,2,B002AMUDK8,"The creator of the legendary series ""The Wire"" returns with ""Treme"", a series that fairly disappoints with the post-Katrina New Orleans time frame of late 2005.  I won't go into a long synopsis, with plenty more than mine available.  Suffice to say, David Simon as well as ""The Wire"" alumni Clarke Peters & Wendell Pierce were my main draws to watching this.  I KNEW this was not going to be related to the heroin crime trade as ""The Wire"" was, but I was still expecting a quality dramatic storyline.  Unfortunately, the plot-lines and MOST of the cast were just not enthralling enough to care about.  Wendell Pierce's character had some decent moments, as well as the street playing couple with the violinist young girl and the keyboardist & (horribly) singing guy from Holland.  Clark Peters character is nowhere near as endearing as he was in ""The Wire"" as Lester Freamon.

I realize I've made a few references to ""The Wire"", and that's because we'll never see a show again like that, with so many well acted and created characters and storylines.  However, ""Treme"" is no where near it in quality and if you feel like being bored to tears, then by all means, go at it.  I tried to warn you all.

Oh, and I was not a fan at all of the music.  Just not my cup of tea (and far too much of it in an effort to cover up the lackluster writing.)",1399766400,2,1341,4.43265306122449

I can't believe it's taken us so long to pick up this show! It's a wonderfully written and incredibly accurate portrait of New Orleans post Katrina. The music alone makes me all happy, hopeful and weepy at the same time.

Treme is the most authentic depiction I have ever seen of New Orleans and the Mardi Gras Indians, the general culture and especially the music culture.  The acting is excellent and real New Orleans musicians appear throughout and the real problems of the city are well portrayed along with the vibrant culture that, in spite of developers and terrible government, continues to survive there.

3889204,5,B002AMUDK8,"Treme opens with a jaw-dropping visual experience directed by Agnieszka Holland, and continues with nine more episodes of beautiful filmmaking. A different show than its predecessor, The Wire, this is similarly a love letter to the city of New Orleans, but is less political, less thematic, less procedural, and more, for lack of a better term, pure joie de vivre.

Frequent musical performances from New Orleans musicians are freely intercut with conventional scenes, often unknown to general audiences but varied in style and almost invariably entertaining. Several characters are musicians, and despite my own background as a jazz trombonist, I genuinely thought that the actors were playing for real until the DVD extras broke that illusion. However, a colorful and diverse variety of faces representing the full breadth of the city work their way in.

Several actors from The Wire and other David SImon projects are reused, including stars Clarke Peters and Wendell Pierce and yet it is to their credit that I almost never thought of their old, iconic characters. Other performers range from New Orleans locals and various musicians to well-known film actors taking a rare dip in TV. The writing and production staff includes many Wire alums, and though the tone of the new show is different, the richness of detail, naturalism, restraint, and philosophical aspirations of the product remain.

There are a few surprise plot twists, but Treme is largely just about watching characters go about their daily lives. The show is strongly and explicitly post-Katrina, but aspires to tell a broader story of people's lives after the news cameras left. It requires patience, but is ultimately a tremendously entertaining and rewarding viewing experience. The set includes a few documentaries and commentaries and a lot of supplemental information about the music, and also characteristically beautiful packaging, but the show itself is what matters. It didn't get much press or viewership at all while it aired, but it is well worth watching on DVD.",1393891200,4,2046,5.250764525993884

3889216,4,B002AMUDK8,Treme does a good job giving you the flavor of New Orleans. This first season starts right after Katrina and shows the anguish the people faced. Loved the rant by John Goodman on You Tube. I'm sure he echoed the sentiments of all affected. Once you see this first season you'll be hooked and get the other seasons. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there isn't as much of the local music and great places for going out to see music like the other 2 seasons.,1392508800,,475,4.230769230769231

The opening scene of the first Second Line post-Katrina was just excellent cinema.

Produced and acted by many of the same people behind The Wire, these folks has made me reconsider my dislike of TV shows. As someone who lived in New Orleans post Katrina and was part of the political struggle to rebuild public healthcare, I was impressed by how accurate much of the stories were, and how Treme honors the forgotten people who make New Orleans  America's most unique city. Recently, I tried to watch some other popular HBO etc. TV series, and... well... they just don't cut it. So watch Treme at you own TV enjoying risk.",1387756800,,853,4.756756756756757

It is intircate and real as far as what the poorest and even middle class people have had to deal with in trying to get their lives back to some form of ""normal"".  It is clear that there is still a lot of corruption and behind the door deals going on and this series, even though it is dramatized, is good at pointing out some of these issues the population is facing.

3889266,4,B002AMUDK8,"Treme will not be to everyone's taste (although it suits mine).  (1)  You have to like, or want to learn about, New Orleans' musical heritage and current music scene.  If you don't, you might be bored by this series, because it actually stars the music and the musicians, many of whom are actual working performers.  (2)  You have to be open to a series that doesn't have much of a plot.  It's character-driven and ambiance-driven and (as mentioned earlier) music-driven.  There are plots, in the sense of unfolding things that happen to or around people, but not an over-arching plot, other than the attempts of NOLA residents to rebuild their lives and their city.  All that said:  the acting is wonderful, not only by the leads (some of whom are veterans of The Wire) but also by the 'local extras';  the filming and editing are beautiful;  the insights into less known aspects of carnival culture -- particularly the Indians -- are fascinating.

The show really gets inside NOLA - The music, the food, the culture - right after Hurricane Katrina.

""Treme"" captures the beautiful and resilient spirit of the city and its people, as well as the cruelty and corruption that has been a continuous thread woven throughout New Orleans' history.

Well-developed storylines, incredibly accomplished actors and engaging characters, and a magical setting ... it's all a recipe for great entertainment.",1366329600,,535,5.1976744186046515
3889296,5,B002AMUDK8,"I just finished watching Treme Season One, and in my humble opinion, I just finished watching the best season of television I have ever watched.  To really appreciate it, you have to be a big music fan, and a fan of the kind of music that comes out of New Orleans (although that is a broad category), but . . .

This television is unlike any other--ANY other.  While it explores dramatic stories, at a measured pace, the stories are not the point.  Other episodic television builds stories through moments, but this episodic television crafts moments through stories, and the MOMENTS, and not the stories, are the point--the specific moments in time conjured up by the incredible writers and directors and technicians and musicians and actors--to put you, not only in a place and time created by these artists, but to put you back in a place and time you once knew, a place and time in your life when something special and magical was afoot, no matter where you are from, and no matter who you are.

I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this is an entire new way of making art, using pictures and sound.  You can look at great episodic TV like ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos"" or ""Justified"" and it's special, and it even breaks new ground, but Treme is a NEW SPORT ENTIRELY.  The best parts of Treme are not the dramatic scenes to which we have been building, a la a Tarantino movie (and don't get me wrong, I LOVE Tarantino).  The best parts of Treme are the little moments in between, when nothing is happening in terms of advancing the plot.  The little impromptu musical gathering in the Steve Zahn character's apartment, for example, is an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT, in which a woman we never saw before and will never see again belts out a tune, unexpectedly well.  The plot has not advanced one tiny iota, and you never want that scene to end.

This show should never end, in fact, but it's going to, apparently.  Too bad.  It is a marvel--a thing of utter beauty--and I am going to make seasons two and three stretch out as long as I can, and then I'm going to go back and watch all of them again.  They're not just that good--for a music fan like me, this is the best television that has ever been made, without doubt.",1366329600,5,2221,4.438423645320197

3889304,5,B002AMUDK8,"I am a TV sceptic. I watch only news and sports. I never go zapping. I use the TV set for watching DVDs. I found out a while ago that American TV series have a lot to offer. I started watching DVDs of shows like The Wire about Baltimore police work, Deadwood about gold digging pioneers in Dakota (or Montana?), Boardwalk Empire about prohibition time Atlantic City, Sopranos about a New Jersey mob family.. All excellent stuff. And there is more.
Now I discovered Trem. It is the name of a part of New Orleans, and the name of a TV series about New Orleans post Katrina. Written by the people who did the Wire, with some of the Wire's cast (eg Wendell Pierce, one of the black cops in the Wire, is a central character in Trem, trombone player Antoine). Among the outstanding cast we find big John Goodman as a cranky lit professor who posts political rants on YouTube, and  Melissa Leo as a lawyer with much pro bono work, helping a black family locating one of theirs, who got lost in the prison system.
The series works perfectly for me, with its combination of interconnected narration threads and the ever present music.

Just the best. Hurricane Katrina was horrible and I cannot imagine living through it but Treme was a good thing that came out of all that pain and destruction. This series really brings to life the heart and soul of New Orleans.  Down in the Treme it's me and my baby, we're all going crazy jumping and having fun!!",1361836800,,667,4.2109375

The cinematography is gorgeous, a poem of debris and human doggedness as the people of Treme (pronounced Tre-MAY) struggle to recover from hurricane Katrina's destruction.

I thought he did a great job capturing the spirit of post-Katrina New Orleans, and really excelled in picking up the local culture.

If the intent is convey the depression and despair which followed in the aftermath of Katrina, then it succeeds.  However, I personally find the direction lacking and feel that many times a very flimsy script is being fleshed out to fill up the time required to make a complete episode.  The acting is very good and the characters are interesting and we are trudging along into Season 2 in hopes that this beast finally rises above the bar which is set  so low.",1353715200,,657,4.5423728813559325

3889378,3,B002AMUDK8,"Let me be clear: Treme is a good show. It is not great. The difference between HBO series Treme, the Wire, Six Feet Under, and Game of Thrones is that The Wire, Six Feet Under and Game of Thrones have characters you can't help but fall in love with. Treme, though the cast is great, does not develop those one or two--in the case of The Wire, those dozen--characters whose 0n-screen deaths will bring tears to your eyes. The focus is the music, and the music is good, but as a result, in too many cases, the characters are cliched and one-dimensional. I stopped watching after the third or fourth episode of season two.

I'll say this though: It is probably damn near impossible to dream up another masterpiece like The Wire. I tip my hat to David Simon for even giving it a try.",1340668800,3,779,4.372413793103449

I can't say the same for the episodes on the second DVD, because it was defective. I called Amazon just now to let them know that it was defective, but I was informed that I had missed the window of when I could return a defective product. After asking to speak to a manager, I waited on hold for a while, and then I was told that I could return the set for a refund, but they wouldn't replace it. So I said thanks, that's fine.

What's happened to Amazon? I thought their service was what made them a great company. I order from them all the time. Maybe not so much now.",1330560000,8,803,4.141025641025641
3889380,5,B002AMUDK8,"This series has a slow start but it's worth it if you have an interest in the NOLA subculture or Katrina's aftermath or just strongly developed characters in a story. There are no explosions nor big sex scenes nor murders to solve here. It's about the culture of New Orleans and the spirit of New Orleanians rising above the tragedy of Katrina. The number of character focuses are dozens upon dozens which include the indelible John Goodman and a cast of other characters who are mostly recognizable from THE WIRE and perhaps HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS. The music was absolutely awesome. New Orleans Jazz is where it's at and David Simon, who is arguably best known for THE WIRE, truly catches the feel. There's a  moving ending in the last episode in which we flashback to moments before Katrina and where all the characters were and what they're doing. The creators said this chilled the NOLA people who lived through Katrina. BTW, the Treme is a working class neighborhood which has fused many different ethnic backgrounds together. Several famous New Orleans musicians came from this area. Be warned there is a lot more focus on the setting and characters for this series over plot. In essence ya gotta fall in love with New Orleans and some of the characters or this won't work for you. And don't worry you can tell a story without too much of a plot. Its been done before. I would give this at least two full episodes before making a decision. I watched the first one and just wasn't in the mood for it hence my long watching time. Thanks to the DVD commentary pointing out some elements I missed when first watching this superlative series. Primetime Emmy Awards: 2010 nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Agnieszka Holland, ""Do You Know What It Means (Pilot)"") and 2010 nomination for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics (Steve Earle, ""This City"").  Grammy Awards: 2010 nomination for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television, or other Visual Media 2010 nomination for Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (Steve Earle, ""This City""). NOLA LOCAL RESPONSE TO THE SHOW (from Wikipedia): New Orleanians waited cautiously for the series premiere of Treme, but quickly embraced the show as an accurate and honest representation of the city. The Times-Picayunewriter Dave Walker expressed the city's collective sentiment that Treme is ""the screen depiction that New Orleans deserves, has always desired, but has been denied. Still, not all residents are satisfied with the series. While Simon attempted to recreate post-Katrina New Orleans with precision, subtle anachronisms such as the inclusion of a Hubig's pie in the first episode when such pies were still unavailable riled viewers. Simon prefaced the airing of the first episode with a letter in The Times-Picayune promising not historical accuracy but that it would be ""thematically so. Treme includes many location-specific references, as did Simon's The Wire. In response, The Times-Picayune publishes a weekly debriefing of each episode's unexplained New Orleans references called ""Treme Explained."" OTHER PIECES (POSSIBLE SPOILERS): The relationship between David and Janette, affectionate but nowhere near love, was done well. Alan, wanting to be a great musician but not having it and having to watch as its evident his girlfriend has it. That would be Annie who everybody seems to like/love in the show. Speaking of that couple there is a nice juxtaposition of one couple getting together as they fall apart. I like how the Toni character was not allowed early on to come to terms that it was a suicide and that maybe her husband had just died. But, after several scenes and almost a full episode she has to face the evidence that her husband gave up and left her.  Some other points about parades and Mardi Gras: You don't watch a parade, you jump into it. There are typically 5 or 6 different types of Mardis Gras going on it isn't GIRLS GONE WILD. In fact, a lot of the celebrations are family events. The first season begins and ends on ordinary life a la the argument over the cab fare.

Reporter: I suppose if you're a fan of the music, which has rather seen it's day, let's be honest. Or the food, a provincial cuisine which many would say is typically American: too fat; too rich. And, yes of course, New Orleans has its advocates, but what about the rest of the country?

Certainly he wasn't the last. Its frauds and farces represent some of America's worst excesses and affronts. But day by day,  year by year, New Orleans also conjures moments of artisitic clarity and urban transcendence that are the the best that Americans as a people can hope for. That is, if we who bear withness to them are not too jaded, too spent and too stupid to recognize them for what they are."" /// ""Hello, YouTube?  This is Creighton Bernette from New Orleans. Yeah ... we're still here. I just want to say something to all y'all trying to figure out what to do about our city:  Blow (up a balloon for) me.  You say:  Why rebuild it?  I say: `Frak' you. You rebuilt Chicago after the fire ... you rebuilt San Francisco after the earthquake. Let me tell you something:  Anything that's any `schprucking' good in Chicago came from someplace else ... and San Francisco is an overpriced cesspool with hills.  To Houston and Atlanta may I say:  Lick my `hirsute cheese' balls. You took in thousands of our people, but guess what?  You still suck. We got more culture in one neighborhood than you got in all your sorry-'ascot' sprawling suburbs put together.  To New York?  ""Insert foreign objects where they don't belong in"" you too.  You get attacked by a few fundamentalist `fargging grassholes' and the federal money comes raining down like rose petals.  Our whole `flipping' coast was destroyed and we're still waiting for someone to give a good `St. Pete'.  But you want to write off New Orleans ... cancel Carnival.

What a despicably uncreative way for the writers to scold government officials for the lack of a federal response to Katrina for so long, and then for all the bungling that came when government agencies did try to do something.

But you know what? It works. It was perfect. It was angry. It was frustrated. It was human. And it makes you, the viewer, think, ""What would I do if I survived such a horrible disaster only to see things made worse by massive government corruption?""

You might think this series is all about the city and the aftermath of the disaster. But you would be wrong. It's all about the characters and how they go about their lives. They're fighting every episode to get some help, to improve their lives, to improve the lives of others or just return to where they were before all hell broke loose. And it's captivating. The characters reel you in to their special little corner of the world and make you almost wish you were right there with them trying to make that corner special again.",1317254400,6,1194,4.523148148148148

""Treme, Season One""
(HBO, 2011)
----------------------------------------
Let me start by saying that I am a huge, huge fan of the Wire -- a genuine American epic of Shakespearean depth and brilliance, perhaps the best-written, best-produced, best-acted TV drama ever. I went into ""Treme"" overflowing with good will for the creative team, and despite all my best efforts as a viewer, found myself sorely disappointed.

The show is too preachy, the dialogue and the scenarios are too stilted, and while the acting is for the most part superb, it is difficult to care about the characters, mostly because they seem like stick figures and caricatures.  This is particularly true for Steve Zahn -- an actor I adore -- whose manic R&B, music-loving whiteboy DJ character is too over-the-top and unbelievable.  Ditto with John Goodman's profane Tulane professor. It just doesn't ring true, and the writing for pretty much every scene in the entire series is simply too on-the-nose and overly obvious. The plight of post-Katrina New Orleans is a vital, compelling story, but I think David Simon overplayed his hand and missed an opportunity to tell it with the same subtlety and narrative strength as seen in ""The Wire."" There is strong content here, to be sure, and the show reveals a culture and contemporary history that most Americans know little about. But the show itself does not cohere or convince, there is a side to it that feel slapdash and forced, producing a narrative tension that grates against the cultural authenticity the writers seek to explore.

Also, I found myself growing weary of the long stream of celebrity drop-ins -- I'm sure that everyone in the world would like to have a cameo in a David Simon show, but certain sequences, such as the New York cocktail party and the celebrity chefs dropping by the Treme restaurant just seemed like star-****ing on Simon's part, and drew me out of the plot. The performances by real-life musicians make more sense, but even then you are aware of a what-a-clever-boy-am-I-ishness to it all.  Yes, I suppose I am being too harsh, and ""Treme"" is a worthy show... But to be honest it's not a great, mind-blowing show and sometimes it was a bit of a chore to get through. Sorry.  Gotta call 'em like I see 'em.  (Axton)",1311724800,14,2312,4.958656330749354

3889481,5,B002AMUDK8,"Maybe not quite up to the standard set by The Wire, but Treme (Season 1) is exceptional television drama.

I picked up the Season 1 box based on recommendations alone, and the fact that I've enjoyed other HBO series.  I'm near speechless.  I can't believe how deeply this series got under my skin.  The first few episodes, beautifully crafted as they are, didn't grab me in the way other outstanding cable shows (Mad Men, Breaking Bad, etc.) have done.  I stayed with it, though, and I'm glad I did.  By halfway into the season, I started feeling the characters and plot lines big time, and by this final episode, I wish it didn't have to end.  I'm sure others here have raved about the performances, the music, the stunning cinematography, and all that.  It's true: the series is worth every penny of the admittedly pricey box set.  Ultimately, though, ""Treme"" is more than the sum of its parts.  It captures something that ordinary words can't, similar to the way a poem can't be reduced to a linear narrative or second-hand description.  You have to be in it to get it.  But give yourself to this show, give it your time and your attention, and it pays off like no other series I've ever seen.",1308009600,40,1165,4.548076923076923

3889487,5,B002AMUDK8,"I hate to focus the work of hundreds down to a single auteur, but David Simon has now put together an impressive oeuvre of modern American realism.  'The Wire' was, of course, one of television's singular achievements, and in my opinion 'Generation Kill' was equally triumphant.  I must admit I was worried, even disappointed, when I heard that Simon's next project would star Wendell Pierce as a jazz musician in New Orleans.  The potential seemed there for mere boosterism.  And indeed, 'Treme' is largely a paean to the crescent city.  The city is not a character, but many characters - from the gritty Treme, to the glossy Quarter, to genteel Uptown.  But like all of Simon's work, Treme's real strength is in its cast of characters, played by fantastic actors who are given the freedom to bring the city to life.  This show is an ensemble drama - unlike 'The Wire', there is no overarching plot tying it all together.  There are just the stories of ordinary people, and of course the sounds of great music.",1307232000,3,1011,4.704545454545454

I ached through much of the bad things which kept happening in this documentary/ story to this spirited and yes, sometimes outlandish place. I had the privilege of living in NOLA for 10 months in 1998 and love it-the people are fun, friendly, helpful, kind and the music-oh my-keeps your foot tapping and your heart light! The film has subtly blended this feeling and joy  throughout the real tragedies occurring,  as the residents travel through the heartbreak of katrina and the often shameful treatment by the government. I hope it will serve to illustrate the true value and worth of this area of our country while also entertaining and delighting us with its stories. Maybe it will also enlighten some of the US citizens who seem to think New Orleans is just Bourbon St. I feel this is a very well done series as Simon's The Wire also was-I am looking forward to buying next season.

David Simon also produced and wrote this series about the aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans.  I found it difficult to understand the tensions and the under-stories.  When I listened to the commentary I began to understand.  Many of the comments were things you would only ""get"" if you understood a certain genre of music or if you new all the history of New Orleans.  I would not have minded this so much if the commentary would have spent some time explaining the under-stories to me, but it didn't.  one example is the New Orleans Indian back story.  that was clearly a theme throughout the season, but the commentary only said, ""well, it is too complicated to understand and explain now so just Google it and you will learn."" It was frustrating series.  The drama of some of the story did not make sense to me either, for instance the death of a character.  The death was all of a sudden and I did not understand how it fit into the story.  I do not plan on purchasing more seasons of Treme.",1306454400,21,1108,4.522613065326633

He is no seriouse actor and the pontificating he is given in the script means his on screen death can not come too soon.(Sorry John I will always treasure you for the Big Lebowski).Steve Zahn acts out some characture of a bohemian hippy which wouldn't convince a child.

3889529,4,B002AMUDK8,"Treme (according to NY Times pronounced ""truh-MA""Y) is a series set 3 months after Katrina. With an outstanding ensemble cast the hero turns out to be the great music of Jazz and R&B portrayed in the movie. Treme is a New Orleans suburb made famous during slavery as hosting the largest  group of black people outside the South. Unlike the history, the series covers the trials and tribulations of a black and white cast portraying a chef , civil rights lawyer, disc jockey and a Mardi Gras red Indian chief with an amazing costume. Noticeable  roles are played by Khandi Alexander (CSI Miami) and John Goodman but to mention two actors. The authenticity of the show is made all the more real and musicians play themselves with significant appearances by  Kermit Ruffins (New Orleans trumpeter), Allen Toussaint  and Elvis Costello. each episode is interspersed with music as well as cameo appearances including the violinist Lucia Micarelli as street musician.
The series has an amazing feel sharing vignettes of hardships in the aftermath of the hurricane and flooding buoyed by the local music. Viewers unfamiliar with neither the history of Jazz or new Orleans have plenty to learn including what it means to walk the second line at a funeral and enjoy the music.
Viewers critical of the show are likely to be musical aficionados and may not find any solace in the DVD commentary attempting to provide commentary on the music and players. An absolute joy for a novice I must add.
i have not been a fan of the Wire on which the Treme writers cut their teeth but the learning of communicating the issues of dealing with government officials , police and individuals from this previous series surely shines through in this series. A colourful series with humanity deserving watching past 3 episodes if only to learn the secrets to maintaining an enduring community.  Surprisingly, at the time of writing the review the series has not screened in Australia the location of a series of major floods and natural disasters. Perhaps, an Australian series is in the making ? If this is the case Treme is going to be hard to better.",1303689600,4,2126,4.829670329670329
3889530,5,B002AMUDK8,"In the fall of 2005, Hurricane Katrina laid waste to the Gulf Coast. Thanks to decades of federal and local mismanagement before Katrina and staggering incompetence afterwards, nowhere was hit harder than the poorer neighborhoods of New Orleans. With the acclaimed HBO series ""Treme,"" creators David Simon and Eric Overmyer drop us into that punch-drunk city and its dizzying cast of saints and scoundrels.

Anyone familiar with Simon's ""The Wire"" (Best. TV show. Ever.) knows he never tells stories with straight lines, which is fitting because New Orleans demands a blurry, boozy perspective. Stories in ""Treme"" intertwine and break away, sometimes to reconnect and sometimes to end. The show, which takes its name from one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, follows local residents as they try to take their lives and city back.

And the characters! They come at you in waves, each as flawed and memorable as the next. A worthwhile summary would take pages, but all you need to know is that the stellar cast of the famous and soon-to-be (John Goodman, Wendell Pierce, Melissa Leo, Khandi Alexander, Kim Dickens, Clarke Peters, Steve Zahn, Rob Brown, and on and on) do tremendous work breathing life into Simon's and Overmyer's narrative. Not much lies in their way, except an insurance industry looking to loophole its way out of liability, a police force strained beyond its limits, an occupying National Guard, endemic local government corruption, a shifting national attention, and their own ""serious deficiency of work ethic.""

The rich culture of New Orleans ultimately takes center stage in ""Treme,"" and the music (which will have you shopping for a new sound system) infuses every episode. Cameos by jazz royalty such as Dr. John, Kermit Ruffins and Lloyd Price as well as Steve Earle and Elvis Costello bring home how much the music is the oxygen in the city's blood. But the food and the festivals of the city also shine, with special attention paid to the Mardi Gras Indian chiefs getting decked out in the most gloriously out-there costumes ever seen on American streets.

The collection's extras include informative and entertaining commentary tracks as well as scene-specific musical commentaries. ""Down in the Treme"" and ""The Music of Treme"" are text-only extras, offering introductions to tidbits, slang and characters from the show.

3889531,3,B002AMUDK8,"I really should be doing a video rant ala Crayton but...I ADORE this series. Brilliant writing, it's flaunting conventional wisdom of narrative flow and pacing makes for a uniquely immersive viewing experience. And its richness of obscure, yet accurate details of the history and experience of living in New Orleans invites a level of active participation that proves highly addictive. BUT...

The DVDs screen DISTINCTLY DARK - appreciably darker than the original broadcasts. So are simply technologically flawed -- and there's no reason for this other than HBO's lack of quality control.

As per the extras:
""The Music of Treme"" in-episode viewing mode - perfunctory and ultimately pathetic. The pop up boxes list song title and the person performing it on screen, no mention of the writer or the performer that the song is most closely associated with or any of their history.

For instance, in the scene where Annie is accompanying pianist Tom McDermott at a private party and they're playing ""New Orleans Bump"" (could be titled, ""New Orleans Blues"" - I'm writing this in a rush early Saturday morning) - the pop up window says: ""New Orleans Bump"" Tom McDermott. There's no mention that it was written, originally performed and recorded by Jelly Roll Morton and as Morton is one of the originators of Jazz and inarguably one of the seminal figures in New Orleans music history that information might have also been useful.

Moreover, a lot of music is not thus notated at all -- the Mardi Gras Indian chants, songs playing on the radio or jukeboxes, etc.

The audio Music Commentaries are also shockingly lame. In the scene noted above the commentators say ""That's Jelly Roll Morton."" No explanation whatsoever of who he was, no mention of his musical achievements and place in New Orleans music history.

What really makes all this especially irritating is that a number of folks have pointedly offered up highly detailed and fairly engrossing commentary on the series that does all the things you'd hope you were getting in purchasing this DVD set for instance, the Times Picayune's ""Treme Explained"" column:
[...]

NPR also provided a useful line of commentary.

So - the ""Treme"" series itself is one of my favorite television viewing experiences in DECADES. Engrossing, revelatory and educational (my music collection devoted to NOLA based music went from a couple Meters' albums, Lee Dorsey and Fats Domino to -- well a HEALTHY selection going from Jelly Roll to Mystikal and many points in between. But this DVD set is technologically inadequate and the extras I mention -- seem like a grudging after thought. In all fairness, we're still digesting all the extras and thus can't say anything about the documentaries included as of yet. Hopefully they'll be meatier.

Notwithstanding, I am eagerly looking forward to season 2. During a visit to NOLA December 2010, as we were leaving our hotel in the financial district, heading for the airport we happened upon the ""Treme"" crew filming a scene in the hotel restaurant, which was being used to portray chef Jeanette in NYC -- ""cooking her way back to New Orleans"" as a PA told us. YAY.

PS for folks who do get involved in deeper study on the people/culture/music of New Orleans there's an amazing free archive of video footage shot in 1982 by famed folklorist Alan Lomax here: [...]",1302912000,34,3342,4.951785714285714
3889532,5,B002AMUDK8,"Treme is for anyone who has been to New Orleans, who loves jazz, modern jazz, rock, folk, Cajun and other music.  Each episode, in the fore and background show the diversity of America as seen in New Orleans, from Indian Chief to Second Line walks to the cemetery and back.  Culture, Pride, Music, History, Food: it is the story of New Orleans but of you also, and your life.  At the end, one character tries to explain why to live in New Orleans by making marking the best of everything that is New Orleans.  ""Po-Boy isn't a sandwich!"" he says in outrage to the claim that NY has sandwiches also, ""It is a way of life.""

For all those who have been beat down by nature, by the twists and forms of government, by addiction or the exhaustion of day to day living, this series is your song.  In showing how five, eight, ten people of different social status, different backgrounds all `get by' in the aftermath of disaster you will see your darkest hours reflected.  But also, you will see the day after.

For music lovers, this series is as good as a box set of the best musicians in concert.  Each episode has not one but up to a dozen real musicians, under the real name, performing.  One character, playing a `bone' (trombone) player of higher but not top name grade shows how much live music is part of New Orleans.

At a time when series like Human Target have cut the live orchestra and replaced it with the inexpensive `needle drops' to see so many musicians, cooks, all `play for the money' makes me feel this series, like New Orleans is a rare gem which may be lost.

3889546,5,B002AMUDK8,"Trem is a true picture of the quirky grandness of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Not only is the acting first-rate (John Goodman, Melissa Leo as part of a repertory group), but the music will set your feet to stompin' and your body to relaxin'. You can almost smell the superb food of the French Quarter as you dance on down Bourbon Street.

Stories of people you come to love can make you laugh, or cry, or both.

New Orleans is a very special place, below sea level, the scent of magnolias in the air, street musicians, jazz unlike anywhere else. Why you can stand in Jackson Square and you have to look up to see the boats passing by. No place like it in the entire world.

If you can't visit New Orleans to see these wonders for yourself, get Trem. ""We don't bow, we don't know how.""",1302220800,2,793,4.266666666666667
3889547,2,B002AMUDK8,"I am sorry I paid $36 for this. After watching excellent series (Mad Men, Weeds, The Good Mother, Modern Family, Big Love and, lessly, Parenthood), I find this one uncompelling (after the 3rd episode) and borderline unwatchable.

I am not learning anything I didn't know about New Orleans after the levees broke.

The writing and editing give us such a shallow take on characters I don't care much about any of them. The cutting is so quick we don't get to linger on anyone or anything much.
Scenes are so dark sometimes it is impossible to know what is going on -- for no reason. I thought this film style had gone the way, as it should by now.
The director doesn't help, as he/she futts around with too many cameras, too much cutting, and -- lack of time taken with actors so an in-depth or nuanced performance is not what's on offer.

At the beginning of the third episode we are treated to a full-bodied ass-screwing of a black prostitute by a sociopathic black musician (lives with one other woman and his baby and ignores kids he has with another), complete with sound-track of squishy-squishy sounds. I know NO kids watched this series and plenty of others too. This using of a woman (who turns and blows bubbles with gum during the act) as a receptacle, making a black man act the fool in this way, is a reprehensible example of sex, race and human 'intercourse' -- for children and others who are looking for emotionally mature entertainment.

The corruption of the NOPD is hard to watch -- stopping and beating up blacks (mostly) for an open can of beer on the street, talking back, etc., when people, the wrong people, are being held in jails (for FEMA money) and not allowed due process.

A black man severely (in the dark) beats a young man he catches stealing from him, and goes about his business.

The white DJ who thinks he's black seems to lack something, I don't know what it is, maybe good lines.

On the whole, we don't know these characters, their motivations, or care. I don't have any hope. It will get better but will push through (because I have mislaid my copy of Friday Night Lights and the producers have not seen their way clear to release from captivity Modern Family 2, Community 2, The Big Bang Theory 4? (Good for the tall guy) yet.

3889548,5,B002AMUDK8,"In my experience, this series divides people. Not in a love/hate sense, but more in a love/indifference sense. The people that are indifferent often sense that something worthwhile is going on but just can't get into it. I agree that it does requires some effort, particularly if you were expecting to slip into quite easily, as you could with ""The Wire"".

If you are one of the people that loves this series, the DVD set is everything you could ask for. Not only do you get a well-presented DVD, good episode descriptions leading you into each episode, and various commentaries not only on the episodes themselves but also specifically on the music; you also get a very well-recorded 5.1 soundtrack that sounds brilliant on a good surround system. They have also not cheaped out on the video quality, putting three episodes per disc (except for the first disc, which has 2 episodes owing to the longer first episode).

3889549,5,B002AMUDK8,"I know there is only one review posted here of the DVD set since it was released last week (the others were all pre-release comments) and I'm assuming that is because those who have the set are buy watching it. I'm doing a ""total immersion"" in the set but am far enough along that I can post my review here for those wanting to know if it's worth getting. In a word: ""YES!"" - though there is one small annoying I'll point out shortly.

If you don't get (or didn't get HBO on cable) you need this set to watch one of the finest TV dramas of last year - and unarguably the best use of music in a TV series. But it, like me, you had the opportunity to see the show when it aired (Season 2 starts on April 24th) you still need this set. Why? Because there are so many layers to what is going on and certain events that occur have their gestation in something that happened in an earlier episode. But more important is the fact that there are commentary tracks to about half the episodes. And not just one, but two different ones. First there are the commentaries by the creators and actors (the pilot episode - longer than others at 77 minutes - is a must listen) and then there is a separate commentary on the music performed. PLUS there is a ""soundtrack"" option, which you should choose - even on first viewing - which reveals all the music being played or performed. Besides the amazing real-time performances by Kermit Ruffins, Allen Toussaint, Dr. John, Steve Earle and more! - full versions of classic NOLa records (""Buena Sera"" by Louis Prima for instance) are here. I don't ever remember that being done before. So, like me, you may find yourself watching the pilot THREE times and finding something new each time.

The last disc includes some other Bonus features. First is a ""making of"" which is about 15 minutes ling and is just okay - similar to many other ""Making of"" featurettes. This is followed by a 30-minute HBO-produced featurette putting the show in perspective with a focus on the heritage of New Orleans - especially after Katrina. Well done. That's it for features.

One other observation: while the director/actor commentaries run completely through an episode the music commentaries don't. There may be periods as long as 10 minutes where there are no comments so you may have to scan ahead a bit during the dialog portions.

I mentioned at the top that there is one annoyance on the set and that is the need for HBO to sell the full video performances that were done for the show. An insert in the package says you can download them on iTunes. But downloading on iTunes means you can only watch them on reasonably small PC screen. HBO would have made this an all time keeper you will return to often if it just included the videos on the DVD - even adding a few dollars to the price. Then you could watch them in all their glory on your TV. The set is still so important that I'm being generous and not deducting a star here. But I sure hope they correct this when Season 2 is released next year. (By the way, if you love this series like I do, you definitely need the companion soundtrack CD!)

So, I'm still only 2/3 of the way through the set listening to the commentaries but that's enough to post my review here. If you love jazz, R&B, brass bands, Steve Earl, Elvis Costello and GREAT drama, this set is for you!

3889550,5,B002AMUDK8,"Those looking for David Simon to follow up the Wire with a similar crime related series would be bitterly disappointed; those alternatively looking for one of the best American dramas in recent years from the superb HBO stable then the ""eagle has landed"". The series is essentially a love letter to the shattered city of New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina. It certainly is an indictment of the Bush administrations gross mishandling of aftermath and like Dave Edger's recent book Zeitoun there are times when ""Treme"" makes you literally fume at the debacle that followed infused by racism.  In particular the spectacle of a largely poor black community ""left behind"" and an incredibly nervous and paranoid Police force.

But if your singular interest is examining the wake of the unmitigated disaster, which is Katrina, then Spike Lee's ""When The Levees Broke"" should be your port of call. ""Treme's"" landscapes are far wider and it aims to capture the essence of New Orleans by tapping into traditions of jazz music, culture, carnival & Mardi Gras, language, cuisine and particularly the sheer bloody minded resilience of its residents. Like all David Simon scripts it builds slowly but surely until the characters hold your attention in a vice like grip. ""Treme"" is the district epicentre of New Orleans jazz and around that culture are woven human stories of resettling in the destroyed city, people seeking lost relatives dispersed across the USA or eking out a living as the city attempts to recover. Music is at the heart of the series and Treme is not afraid to stop the story and introduce a jam session or a carnival band. Thus you have highlights such as a great version of ""My Indian Red"" led by the great Dr John; the fabulous Kermit Ruffins playing ""Skokiaan"" in another episode and a soundtrack jam packed with great music. Throughout we also have the appearance of stellar musicians like Steve and Justin Townes Earle, Elvis Costello and Allen Toussaint. In sense who are we to argue with HBO claim that Treme sees ""one of the best organic uses of music in a series"".

The characters at the heart of the series are drawn from ""Wire"" stalwarts like Wendell Pierce who plays the colourful local musician ""Antoine Batiste"" and Clarke Peters who plays the chief who leads one of the exotic Mardi Gras ""Indian"" tribes with their mix of African/American/Indian traditions feeding into the glorious city Carnivals. These resume three months after Katrina but with them re-emerge problems of gang violence and crime. The there are a number of other key characters namely John Goodman's angry Professor Creighton Bernette whose epic foul mouthed tirades against George W Bush are oratorical fireworks as he reminds the President ""You rebuilt Chicago after the fire you rebuilt San Francisco after the earthquake"". Then there is Gonzo DJ Davis Mclary played by Steve Zahn. I have to admit that in the first couple of episodes I disliked this character but stick with Zahn since his anarchic portrait of the passionate Bohemian New Orleans resident ""who wants his city back""  grows to be one of the series best. Equally the redoubtable Khandi Alexander who plays the tough bar owner LaDonna Batiste-Williams also in a desperate search of her ""lost"" brother is superb throughout.

""Treme"" is unique series and one that invest enormous and intricate detail into its warm and diverse set of characters. It is New Orleans Cajun culture writ large with its nuances, colour and language are at the heart of this show. At the opening point of one of his Internet rants ""Creighton Bernette"" proclaims ""yes we are still here"". At this moment you feel the pain and the passion in his words and fundamentally its channelling that same pain and passion for this historic, flawed but vital city into the medium of TV that gives ""Treme"" its big beating heart.",1301443200,4,3848,4.932098765432099

3889552,5,B002AMUDK8,"At this point of writing, we have only had the first 4 episodes of 'Treme' shown here in the UK, so my review is based on this, rather than a complete 'product review' of the entire series and/or box set, as such.  However, this is one of the few recent television series that I cannot wait for the next episode to be shown (the other being the excellent Danish thriller, 'The Killing', though I digress).

So far, 'Treme' is as artistically rich as anything I have seen from HBO and the series producers and associated team have raised the creative bar to a very high level indeed, taking on the historically and ethically complex 'story' of post-hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, as seen by way of multiple, often coinciding, and wonderfully drawn, diverse, characters. It immediately engenders a deep sense of 'integrity' throughout.

The deeper social and moral aspects within the unfolding narrative of each episode of 'Treme'  put me in mind of the issues found in many of John Sayles' films, and the varying perspectives of all the central characters segue seemlessly from one narrative thread to another.  Indeed, apart from the moral 'preaching' seen in John Goodman's brilliant character, the university lecturer, 'Creighton Bernette', 'Treme' is not simply didactic concerning the way in which the social effects of this disaster are presented, rather it 'moves' with a deeply rich sense of 'life force', fun and momentum, that dynamically shifts and turns rather like the creative spirit that underwrites this drama: the (jazz) music!  The opening scene of a saxophonist fitting a reed in the 'pilot' is pure gold!

Indeed, if you like jazz, R&B, Blues etc, then this is a very important series, and is 'hardcore' in this respect, introducing great musicians who appear - (though don't always perform, sadly) - including: altoist, Donald Harrison; Elvis Costello, and the genius that is pianist, McCoy Tyner, to name but three.  The use of soundtrack throughout is fantastic, and a multiple perspective scene towards the end of the 'pilot' in which Steve Zahn's outstandingly portayed, some-time musician/DJ, 'Davis McAlary' plays Louis Prima's, 'Buona Sera', is as rich and evocative as Scorsese's or Tarrantino's use of music in cinema.  Outstanding!

Steve Zahn's performance has an energy and depth that is truly Oscar-worthy and he is arguably one of the great actors of his generation.  He absolutely 'nails' the character of 'Davis' and gives me goose-bumps whenever he appears on-screen given his vitality and the way in which he portrays this mercurial, self-centred, 'know-it-all' character who's 'always right', though appears constantly to walk a see-saw between material and artistic success and failure!  There is also something deeply Shakespearean about his character within the overall scope of this drama that is at once deeply mischievous like Puck, and yet also inhabits the different social realms rather like 'Feste' in 'Twelfth Night' by way of his incisive wit and musical 'talents'.

The rest of the cast is wish-list stuff, including: Melissa Leo; Wendel Marshall et al and the excellent (and perhaps underrated) David Morse, to name but a few.

I cannot praise this series highly enough and only hope that it continues to flourish as well as it has started: a deeply poignant reflection given the specific context in which this series is set, and the wider and tragically sad disasters that the World has most recently seen.

3889573,5,B002AMUDK8,"I'm a native New Orleanian that lived in NOLA when Hurricane Katrina hit, so I'll start off by admitting I've a natural bias towards this show and the honest but loving way it examines my city. However, I also know it is imperfect in several ways and will examine those imperfections as well. On paper, Treme is a drama set in the city of New Orleans and takes place during the months that immediately follow Katrina. In reality, it's a love letter to the music and musicians that have been influenced by the city.

Much like their previous series (the outstanding Baltimore crime drama, The Wire), the show's creators seek to examine the heart of a city using a singular touchstone to interconnect a wide array of characters throughout nearly all aspects of the city. With The Wire that touchstone was the ""war on drugs,"" with Treme it is music. Music permeates every character and every inch of this show. So if you're not a fan of, or at least remotely interested in, New Orleans' music, then this show isn't likely for you. And the show's creators are much more interested in the city's more traditional musical roots in jazz, zydeco, dixieland, and blues than the current musical landscape, which is mainly hip-hop oriented.

And this is one area where the series falters. In a show where seemingly every character is an expert on New Orleans' musical history--from a radio DJ, to a Tulane professor, to street performers and session horn players--there is a glaring absence of hip-hop and the local artists that've kept the city a major part of the current musical landscape. It's almost as if Master P, Cash Money, and Lil' Wayne are too mainstream for this show. Sometimes it could become a bit much hearing about this ""legendary"" artist or that ""legendary"" song which originated from the city. Sometimes it'd get to be a bit too much and you'd just want the plot to move forward already.

And I've read some reviews where that was another major complaint--the plot. I'll admit this series doesn't have an action packed, clearly structured plot--but that's the point. So many New Olreanians were left in this limbo after Katrina, there was no clear direction, and for many no clear destination. While some pundits across the country were asking, ""Should we rebuild New Olreans?"" this show examines HOW we are rebuilding New Orleans. And I say ""are"" because even in 2011 the city is still in the process of recovering.

Yes, Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster, but what happened to New Orleans was a man made tragedy. Treme's first season examines how the people of the city come to grips with that fact and begin to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, wade through the flood waters, and come out on the other side with music in their souls and hope in their hearts.",1299542400,15,2783,4.743801652892562
3889574,5,B002AMUDK8,"This is certainly one of the most ambitious television series in years, not just for the attempt to deal with post-Katrina New Orleans, but the incredible scope of feelings and emotions and music that at times overwhelm these episodes.  Of course we all know that David Simon and Eric Overmyer are capable of great things, after giving us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B004BZ5AFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Corner/dp/B00009ATJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Corner</a>.  However, given that their roots are in Baltimore, you might think that New Orleans is a bit of a stretch for them.  Not at all, as it turns out.  Thanks to some very thoughtful research, a great appreciation for the city, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Faubourg-Treme/dp/B002OHE1OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Faubourg Treme</a>&nbsp;in particular, they have produced one of the most insightful television shows of this generation.

The series is broken up over ten episodes with the first and last episodes directed by the incomparable Agnieszka Holland.  She seems to capture the theme of the show the best, maintaining a looser style and letting the music carry the episodes.  Other directors like Ernest Dickerson (Right Place, Wrong Time) and Anthony Hemingway (All on a Mardi Gras Day) tend to focus more specifically on certain characters.  They all bring their unique brand of storytelling to the series, principally written by Simon and Overmyer.

The acting is a little uneven. The stories pretty much revolve around a nucleus of key characters, not much unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure/dp/B000V6LSO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure</a>.  These characters embody different characteristics of this great city, ranging from the Lower 9th Ward to the French Quarter to the Garden District.  Khandi Alexander as Ladonna Batiste-Williams represents the strength and resilience of the badly ruined Lower 9th Ward, trying to rebuild her bar, while Wendell Pierce as her ex-husband Antoine Batiste struggles to find gigs, introducing us to the wealth of music in the city ranging from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kermit-Ruffins/dp/B000006BEV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kermit Ruffins</a>, formerly of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebirth-Brass-Band/dp/B00022LJOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebirth Brass Band</a>, to the legendary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Allen-Toussaint/dp/B001PSQGQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Allen Toussaint</a>, who appear in the series.  On the other side of the city we have Steve Zahn and Kim Dickens, as Davis and Jeanette, trying to build on a one night stand, while both of them struggle to regain their bearings after the flood.  Davis is a DJ at WWOZ, which does live streaming on the Internet, and Jeanette struggles to get her restaurant going again with the help of Ntare Mwine as JacQues Vaz.  Anchoring down the Garden District is John Goodman and Melissa Leo as Creighton and Toni Bernette with their daughter Sofia (India Ennenga).  Sonny and Annie cover the more familiar streets of the French Quarter, playing at street corners.  Sonny (Michiel Huisman), a Dutch national has adopted New Orleans, bringing Annie (Lucia Micarelli) down with him from New York, but struggles to match Annie's prowess on the violin.  There are many others.

The show definitely has its political edge, especially when Creighton discovers the power of YouTube to voice his anger and indignation over the slow recovery.  In a very amusing episode Davis decides to run for city councilman, putting together a campaign music CD which becomes a big hit in the city.  The most haunting episodes are those in which Toni, a civil lawyer, helps Ladonna in locating her younger brother, who has been missing ever since the flood, taking us through the Byzantine legal system of the city and ultimately into the jails themselves.

There is a lot to ponder and a lot to enjoy in this series.  So glad that HBO has renewed it. The first season circles back on itself nicely, resolving many of the story lines, so it will be interesting to see where Simon and Overmyer take the series next.",1294963200,16,4506,6.3164763458401305

Top to bottom, front to back, a great job on making a TV masterpiece.  How this series garnered ZERO emmy nominations is absolutely beyond me.  Those that are responsible for the lack of recognition should be moved as far away from the emmy ballot box as possible.

But those are just phony, popularity contest awards anyways.  What counts is that this is one helluva show.  Those that weren't lucky enough to catch it on HBO should buy this immediately.

One of the things I really enjoyed was the music, and I hope that the dvd release will have the exact same soundtrack as what was broadcast.  Have been disappointed before by a dvd movie that had some of the songs changed due to copyright problems.  I also hope there are some good extras included on the dvds, maybe some more music.

3889581,4,B002AMUDK8,"I became a fan of this series and watched each episode with tremendous anticipation.  The series is a tad thin on narrative but very strong on character.  Narratively, in fact, very little happens on the show.  What we get instead is a deep, finely grained exploration of the lives of a number of vividly conceived characters (many of them played by actors familiar from THE WIRE) and a beautiful evocation of a deeply wounded city trying to recover from the  damage inflicted upon it both by hurricane Katrina and the failure of the government to help rebuild it.

This is one of the finest and deepest ensemble casts on television.  There is no real star but instead a number of equally fascinating characters who help hold the show together.  The lack of obvious lead characters is especially felt in the Pilot, where it isn't at all clear who the ongoing characters on the show are (except in the cast of well known actors like Steve Zahn, John Goodman, and Kim Dickens, as well as those from THE WIRE).

I suspect that this show is going to have viewers of the DVDs fall sharply in two camps.  One camp will proclaim it the greatest show on TV (I would rank it about 8th or 9th of the various shows that I watch, well behind series like MAD MEN and CAPRICA and BREAKING BAD and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS), while a second group will be perplexed and express how boring them found it to be.  I think the lack of a deep narrative keeps it from being either among the very best shows on TV (and definitely not as good as David Simon's previous two series, THE WIRE and HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET), but I think that those who don't recognize how outstanding the show is at developing character.  I passionately recommend this show to anyone who loves carefully written, well acted television.",1279929600,14,1788,4.538940809968848
3889582,5,B002AMUDK8,"I loved the series.  The New Orleans Blues and Jazz music woven throughout the series was fantastic.  It was especially interesting as many real and famous musicians were used in the story.  The individual characters are interesting and varied.  John Goodman was a hoot!  Khandi Alexander (CSI: Miami 2002-2009) was really strong, but her stomach here was not.  Very different from CSI.  Musicians Trombone Shorty, Elvis Costello, and John Boutte, to name but a few, were great.  Also the racial mix was a strength to the series and the reality of the real New Orleans and story of Hurricane Katrina.

I especially found the graphics during the credits roll interesting.  Who would of thought that mold and fungus stains on walls, floors, and ceilings could look like art.  Being interested also in biology and photography, I found the house mold interesting to look at, to itself artistic, even though it is often a serious health hazard.  A great idea for a photo project:  someone should photograph the mold stains of New Orleans with Ultraviolet light (Black Light).  Many molds are UV fluorescent!

Anyway, it is a fantastic series, can't wait for Season Two and for this DVD set to be available.  The only downer for me was the latter part of the season's final episode got a bit busy and confusing -- not their best work.  Seems like the producer, director, and writers did not really want to do a season finale, eliminating some characters, but just keep going with the story lines into the next season.  Wish there were a bit more about the foods of New Orleans and the Creole / Cajun South.  But then you can't really taste food on TV.",1279670400,56,1645,4.72887323943662
8359777,5,B002AMUDK8,"I really enjoyed watching this.  It really showed me how really messed up this country is.  New Orleans is a treasure.  Not because of the obvious but the culture.  All our great cities and small towns have an amazing culture.  We need to protect it and nurture it in our young people or us older ones are sunk.  I am poor. I understand not wanting to leave you're home.  It's all you have.  The people you know and family are all you have and when you work hard for it, no one should take it away.  It doesn't matter if its a pile of rubble it's still you're home.  This series showed all sides of things that happened.  I hated the police but felt bad for the ones that were trying to help while they lost everything also.  The music is amazing, the culture, everything about this series is sad and joyful at the same time.  The Spike Lee documentary is an excellent companion to this.  I just do not understand why we can watch the series but can't the extras.  I don't like to complain about service in a review, but really.",1527379200,,1028,4.253886010362694

Its enlightening for audiences to see the havoc Katrina continued to play in peoples lives during the aftermath. The writers seem to want to emphasize annoying idiosyncrasies about the characters rather than a fully developed arc, but maybe thats the point. The quick jumps from scene to scene were also a distraction and made it difficult to get truly engrossed in the storylines.
