8142462,5,B000HXE5QK,"These super-short little 50 minute films covering the 1970 thru 1980 seasons of F1 leave the viewer SCREAMING for more footage, but at least it's SOMETHING, as getting our U.S. hands on anything F1 is as unlikely as finding a suitcase full of cash on the sidewalk! One would've thought that by now a lot of F1 historical material released on VHS would've found its way into U.S. DVD players by now, but sadly we are instead flooded with national, rather than international, motorsport such as the idiotic oval racing of NASCAR or the FAR inferior IndyCar 24/7. Oh well, we must be content with the few snippets we can get. This F1 fan hopes for a day when all of the F1 releases that ever made it to VHS be rereleased to the U.S. in DVD form. That is all.",1379030400,,755,4.361702127659575
8142463,3,B000HXE5QK,"A fascinating look back at a year known mostly for the tragic death of Jochen Rindt and also Bruce McLaren and Piers Courage.  But it also should be known for the emergence of several future great drivers including Emerson Fittipaldi, Clay Regazzoni and Ronnie Peterson to name a few.  Poor three time World Champion Jack Brabham, about to retire at 44 and driving brilliantly, gets no respect as the announcer wrongfully claims he has only won two championships.  As in other Duke videos on F1 the editing could be questioned as there is no video, or film, of the dramatic last lap pass of Brabham by Rindt at Monaco, even though I have seen that footage else where.  The Spanish GP won by Stewart is completely omitted. Until something better comes along this will have to do.  If you are willing to put up with the errors an omissions this 1970 review will have to do.",1181260800,5,871,4.5576923076923075
