8744737,5,B019D3J4XS,A man is hired to kill to people in the room next to his. And after that things start to get messy and confusing. You see the whole film the the eyes of the main character abd you watch him try to stay alive. It's a very fast paced and crazy mess of a film that is a treat for horror fans! I give it a 7 outta 10.,1499558400,,313,3.550724637681159
8744738,4,B019D3J4XS,Bought this one in the store for about the same price. You see some Raw things and such but it looked totally fake but neat kinda has a resident evil feel to it. you won't be disappointed!,1485993600,,188,4.108108108108108

8744740,3,B019D3J4XS,"The, ""first person shooter,"" perspective of the main character is nicely done, though I found a lot of the movie a bit cartoonish for the genre.  The special effects really aren't that special in the modern age of CGI.  This movie was a real missed opportunity for Giulio De Santi, though it is watchable if you know you are getting into a B movie with bad horror monster costumes and unrealistic maximum fake gore reminiscent of 1960ish buckets of blood horror shows your parents wouldn't let you watch.  He's currently filming the sequel to Hotel Inferno, so lets hope it gets a better budget and the special effects are a lot more special, and his vision is more realized.",1467504000,,675,4.65546218487395
8744741,4,B019D3J4XS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Im pretty sure this review is going to make a few readers roll their eyes, but theyll just have to go with it.  Ill start off by stating up front:  I loved HOTEL INFERNO.  It is a blast, and its very entertaining.  Not to mention it has loads of gore.  What more can you ask from a horror movie?

The premise and the way the film is shot are going to dissuade a lot of people from watching it, but I recommend giving it a chance.  Although, I will give this warning:  if movies like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT or games like CALL OF DUTY make you motion-sick, youll definitely want to steer clear of this one.  But you're like me and can handle it, then you're in for a real treat with HOTEL INFERNO.

Now, with all of that being said, this is not a perfect film.  In fact, it has some glaring flaws.  But look past them, take the movie for what it is, and youll have a great time.

HOTEL INFERNO is shot well, particularly for being a first-person POV.  This is not a found-footage film, but rather a real-time see-it-as-it-happens movie.  I love this aspect, as it immerses you in the action.  This is the very reason I love to play first-person POV video games; you get to experience the thrills as if you were right there.

The acting is so-so, not really spectacular, especially since the two main characters are basically voiceovers.  We obviously never see the face of the protagonist, but we do get to hear him speak; and I have to say his voice isn't very pleasant to hear.  It sounds as if he cant make up his mind as to which accent to use.  The antagonist, however, does a great job despite not being seen, and I greatly enjoyed his performance.

The special effects in HOTEL INFERNO are fantastic.  The creatures and henchmen look nasty and grotesque, and theres buckets of gore to go around.  Peter Jackson would be proud!  Granted, a couple of the headshots look animated, but they are blended with practical effects, so the resulting carnage is stunningly good.  My sole complaint about the effects is the lack of originality when it comes to the big, bad female demon/monster.  She is very anti-climactic (I was expecting something monumentally huge and evil), and the sparks she spits look like fireworks.  This isn't a huge detraction for me, but I certainly feel it work mentioning.

The actual story is a bit choppy, and the viewer is forced to make a few deductions here and there that are never confirmed.  I found it to be an interesting premise, but the execution lacks a bit.  Some of the plot is hard to follow here and there, but the end pretty much ties everything together.

Despite its flaws, however, HOTEL INFERNO is a damn good time, and I loved almost every minute of it.  I haven't seen HARDCORE HENRY yet, but I would wager this film will top it in my book; I seriously doubt HH will have anywhere near the thrills or gore that HOTEL INFERNO does.  I recommend this one, and I suggest you give it a look.",1466467200,,3010,4.412727272727273
