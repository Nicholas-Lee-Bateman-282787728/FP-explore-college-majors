8421884,5,B004BCSW7Q,Susie Short is amazing.  These are wonderful instructional videos even for a novice painter to expert that wants to learn to paint an exciting realistic looking waveform or seascape.  She is fun to watch and easy to follow.  I highly recommend both of these together to really learn the watercolor technique of painting the sea.,1292716800,3,328,4.927272727272728
