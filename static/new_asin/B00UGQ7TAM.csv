8706268,5,B00UGQ7TAM,"Barbette a refugee from another world, Babette Hersant (Stephane Audran), seeks a simple life as a cook in a simple village. Both she and the villagers learn from each other. As luck would have it Barbette wins the lottery. She decides to give back something to the simple people that took her into their society in the form of a feast. She gives more than they realize.

This film has a depth that allows everyone to acquire something of value from its viewing.

It is exceptionally beautiful from a cinematic level. The story on the surface is strait forward. There are many underlying meanings, some universal and others will be personal to the viewer.

However some people could interpret that Barbette was doing something weird. Some may think it was sacrilegious as some of the people of the village saw it. Others may see this as she was showing off. Still others that with all of her winnings she was cheap to just give them a meal.

The decision not to eat the stuff is played out in other movies as ""Theodora Goes Wild"" where they are not going to meet a train. Again in ""Chocolat"" they suspected an ulterior motive. But this movie is more moving when you find out the truth behind the gesture and the cost.",1503187200,,1217,4.54337899543379
