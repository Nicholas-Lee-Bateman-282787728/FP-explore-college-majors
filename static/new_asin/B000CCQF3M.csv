A young man gets a call on his cell phone. Jane Martin was kidnapped and held prisoner, she doesnt know where she is kept. She uses a broken cell phone to make a call for help. Why was she taken? Did the kidnappers make a mistake? They know about the womans son Ricky and the school he goes to. Mrs. Martin doesnt know what they want; her husband is a realtor. Brian goes to the school and tries to help, but all the boys wear a blue shirt and khaki pants. This boy is kidnapped by men in a big black sedan! There is a car chase for action. There is a low battery in Brians cellphone! Can he get a charger? Take a number.

Her kidnappers have her son. Where is left field? She is attacked when she won't answer. A bar in LA. She says the family will be killed as theyve seen their faces. A policeman shows up at the Martin home and talks to a woman. [He doesnt ask for any confirmation.] Brian takes a lawyers car and continues the conversation. A tunnel presents a problem! Security screening is a problem, but it reveals an identification. Craig Martin is taken by the kidnappers from the airport to meet Jessica. He tells about his safety deposit box at a bank. Brian goes to that bank and foils the plot with a lot of action. What if he drops his cell phone? He escapes through a tunnel!

Can Brian help the Martin family escape? Can a video phone record from a videotape? The police arrive to take the dirty cops in for a just ending. You can assume there will be a happy ending.

This seems to be inspired by that 1991 incident where a man tested his new video camera and captured the police beating a suspect on the ground, which shocked the nation. Its is a good action movie as long as you don't question the credibility of the story. Whose home was used for the Martin residence?",1512604800,,2336,4.290249433106576
