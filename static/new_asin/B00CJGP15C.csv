5724387,1,B00CJGP15C,"The only question I have is, how many Triple H DVDs do we need?  It seems like every few years we have a new Triple H DVD.  Could it have anything to do with being the bosses son-in-law?  Many good wrestlers have come and gone because Triple H was constantly getting a push over the new young talent.  Could it have anything to do with being the bosses son-in-law?  I am so over Triple H.",1203120000,5,388,4.12
5724388,5,B00CJGP15C,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2014

I've always stated that (backstage politics aside) Triple H is one of the best performers of this generation with this being a match anthology featuring some of his standout matches throughout his career with comments in between on various incidents such as getting started in the business, Chyna, the curtain call, King Of The Ring including a funny story about the ""crown"" itself, the evolution (no pun intended) of his character, his quad injury, Shawn's return, Ric Flair, Batista, Edge & John Cena amongst other things.

Matches Include:
vs. John Crystal - This was his RAW debut & nothing special past that.
""RAW"" May '95

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Marc Mero - This was originally setup to be Mr. Perfect's return to action against Hunter who he had issues with for weeks but had Mero take his place after he was injured backstage as Mero heavily worked over his arm while Hunter was able to work over the back only for Mero to come back with an aerial assault before the ""perfect"" plan was revealed.  This was a solid encounter but more about the historical significance to this career.
""RAW"" Oct. '96

King Of The Ring Finals vs. Mankind - Years before both men started feuding over the WWE Championship in various matches from a street fight to a steel cage to Hell In A Cell, they met here in the finals of the 1997 tournament. Mankind came into this match with a bad neck from his earlier encounter & Hunter showed early signs of his ""cerebral assassin"" persona by targeting that neck & working it over heavily including throwing Foley into the ropes so hard that his head was wrapped around & hung in the ropes in the same manner that caused him to lose his ear years earlier. Hunter continued to beat on his neck with slamming it into the steps & various kneedrops to the head before Mankind was able to get some offense like dropping his elbow from the apron onto Hunter who was on the concrete floor. Chyna did play a factor as the match went on throughout the match with Hunter continuing to beat on Mankind's neck while dishing more punishment like a pedigree through a table. This match did it's job in that we saw Mankind bring out a more aggressive & calculated side of Hunter that we hadn't seen previously but he would be heavily known for years later as ""The Game.""
King Of The Ring '97
[Best Of King Of The Ring]

WWE European Championship Match vs. Owen Hart - It should be noted that the DX Band played Triple H to the ring & Sgt. Slaughter was handcuffed to Chyna at ringside.  Owen dominated early in the ring with offense such as a frankensteiner & outside beating on him right in front of Chyna before Triple H was able to rebound working over the head including cutting Owen over the nose & his previously injured ankle to the point where Owen's own offense hurt himself as both men traded momentum countering each other's offense throughout the rest of the match.  This was a very good encounter between both men.
WrestleMania XIV

vs. WWE Champion Mankind - The Rock was on commentary for this match while Shane McMahon appointed himself the referee which came into play early on as he would avoid counting out Triple H & Chyna would also get physically involved while Triple H used the ringside environment & bent the rules to his advantage including innocent bystanders being taken out at ringside.  The match wasn't much as this was more about telling the story about Mankind fighting against the odds after Triple H had them stacked in his favor after feeling like he was screwed out the title the previous night at SummerSlam.
""RAW"" Aug. '99

WWE Championship/No Holds Barred Match vs. Steve Austin - Vince McMahon made his presence known early on allowing Austin to take advantage with both men brawling for around 10 minutes in the stage area & fighting in the crowd using whatever they could get their hands on through either the ringside environment or from the fans to even ""lowering the boom"" on the other to the point where the referee was taken out on more than one occasion with the fight continuing on the outside resulting in heavy bleeding plus more weapons used & receipts being given for previous attacks including one man looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the night.  This lived up to the stipulation as it was a fight so intense that it still continued after the match until one man completely got out of harms way.
No Mercy '99

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Cactus Jack - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match. Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen. Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process. Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board. From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall. This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who can take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out '00
[Hell In A Cell; For All Mankind: Life & Career Of Mick Foley]

Royal Rumble Match - This was joined in progress with Triple H entering at #22 while Steve Austin was in the ring alone with the highlights for the rest of the match including his confrontation with Austin, The Hurricane, Mr. Perfect's return performance, Big Show vs. Kane, and when it got down to the final four.
Royal Rumble '02

3 Stages Of Hell Match vs. World Champion Shawn Michaels - This was the second ""3 Stages Of Hell"" match which was a traditional 2 Out Of 3 Falls match with the twist being that each different fall would be contested under a different stipulation based off their previous encounters which in this case was a street fight, steel cage, and a ladder match if the third fall was necessary (and lets be honest, they wouldn't tease all 3 falls & not do them) as Triple H came into this match with his quad area heavily taped while the big question coming into the match would be if we would see the ""humble"" Shawn Michaels or ""The Heartbreak Kid.""  Both men took it to the floor early on using the environment around them along with a trash can as Triple H was able to stay one step ahead of Shawn focusing on his back only for Shawn to use the same strategy against Triple H including a backbreaker onto open chairs before Triple H resorted to more violent tactics including taking a page out of his previous battles with Mick Foley when it came to using a specific weapon & turning his attention to the knee.  The weapons remained inside the cage during the second fall with both men continuing to use them against each other while also using the cage as a weapon itself as they fought inside & on top of the cage with not only both men bleeding but others who decided to get physically involved in the match before the third fall saw the ladder used both as a weapon & playing an instrumental part of the match to the point where the footage was used for years afterwords when telling fans ""Don't Try This At Home!""  We definitely saw the return of the ""Heartbreak Kid"" as this was a high quality encounter.
Armageddon '02

Hell In A Cell vs. World Champion Batista - Their third & final encounter for the World Championship with Batista being in control early before hurting his shoulder hitting the post with Batista being knocked off the apron into the cell shoulder first. A biker chain came into play with both men on the end of being whipped & choked with it before Batista got real aggressive delivering a spinebuster between the cell & post busting Triple H open as well. Another weapon was brought into the match in the form of as steel chair wrapped in barbed-wire causing both men to bleed from various parts of the body like the back & face from moves like chairshots, face grinds, powerslam onto it, and even a DDT. Triple H's sledgehammer was brought into play with both men using it to their advantage while the steel steps were also used to punish. This was definitely a brutal battle as both men not only dished out physical punishment but also used the various weapons to not only inflict more punishment but tell a story as well.
Vengeance '05
[Hell In A Cell]

Last Man Standing Match vs. Ric Flair - This got started earlier than expected with Triple H attacking Flair in the isleway while he was still wearing his robe before the fight eventually was taken into the crowd & ringside with Triple H being completely ruthless in attacking his face & back with weapons including one he got out of a toolbox to use as a spike before Flair resorted to his tactics of being the ""dirtiest player in the game"" to fight back along with using the ringside environment & weapons of his own to his advantage focusing on the legs including a figure four submission as Flair kept taking Triple H's punishment & begging for more.  This was physical bloody fight between both men.
Survivor Series '05

vs. WWE Champions John Cena vs. vs. Edge - Edge played to his name of being an ""ultimate opportunist"" early on by taking himself out of the match only to interject himself when things were going to work to his advantage before both men realized what happened & made him the odd man out with both men playing a game of ""Can You Top This?"" using his head as a basketball before things went back to every man for himself with everyone having a one on one encounter against their opponent at some point in the match along with some interaction between all three men both in & outside of the ring with the ringside environment playing a huge part in one man heavily bleeding to the point of wearing a ""crimson mask"" along with a DDT on the spanish table which for once didn't break along with other weapons used such a chair with the loudest chairshot you've probably ever heard while Lita did get involved more than once but it not having the result she intended to have.  This was a fun & physical triple threat match with the big surprise being not who won the match but who was the last man standing.
Backlash '06

(Bonus Match) Hog Pen Match vs. Henry Godwinn - A couple of notes here in that Helmsley was still undefeated in singles competition at this point, Hillbilly Jim returned to the WWE to be the special referee here while Jerry Lawler spent a lot of time on the commentary doing Jeff Foxworthy jokes about Henry Godwinn's hometown. Godwinn went to slop Hunter right from the start only to miss & end up getting the ring announcer & front row but eventually did get Hunter when tied up in the ropes which only caused Hunter to get very aggressive with his offense only for Godwinn to be able to get aggressive himself sending Hunter into the outside steps. They made their way to the hog pen various times with both men either being thrown against it or one instance where Hunter landed on top of it only to come off it with an elbow drop. While the match stipulation was very comedic (as they usually were during this time in WWE), they made the best of this here.
""In Your House"" Dec. '95
[Best Of In Your House]

(Bonus Match) 1st Professional Match as Terra Ryzing vs. Flying Tony Roy - The match itself was nothing special past seeing how advanced he was as far as his wrestling style & telling a story of working over a body part when he was only training for a few months along with the fact that it's pretty funny to see Triple H with the mullet hairstyle & wearing eye shadow back then.  The commentary with Jim Ross & Triple H is the real highlight here as they talked about how he got his ""Terra Ryzing"" name, his feelings before & after the match along with his reaction to the payoff.

In the end, this collection is giving me exactly what I want from a DVD set as most of these matches aren't available on other DVD sets while the matches either highlight special moments in his career or were just quality in itself so I recommend this set.",1202947200,39,12593,4.466289691170074

5724391,5,B00CJGP15C,"First, SHOW ME these other Triple H DVDs.  The only ones I know of are ""That Damn Good"" and ""The Game"", and guess what: NOT ONLY are BOTH of them OUT OF PRINT (that means good luck trying to find them for less than twenty dollars USED), but BOTH of them received little to no publicity when they DID come out!

Kind of ironic that the boss's son-in-law, with so much backstage influence, has BOTH of his prior DVD releases (Both of them released AFTER the name-change to WWE) out of print.

Hate him as you may for his backstage politicking, hate him as you may for burying so much talent on screen, this DVD release is JUST what is needed for a dominating superstar who has yet to receive a proper DVD chronicling his rise.  Because you have to admit it, he has been a GREAT superstar, with tremendous charisma and ring psychology, and put on some really phenomenal matches with the likes of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, and others.  And some people, like me, would like to have a DVD collection which shows us all these matches, and some matches from his olden days in WCW and before then!  And a documentary, too!

Before you moan and complain about Triple H having too many DVD releases, maybe try searching for The Rock or Mick Foley or Stone Cold Steve Austin DVD releases.",1201392000,14,1313,4.445833333333334

5724397,5,B00CJGP15C,"This two-disc DVD set is a chronicle of one of the most dominant and controversial Superstars in the WWE, and it's a good one. It details his beginnings in independent organizations, then his brief stint in World Championship Wrestling, where he wrestled as Terra Ryzing and Jean-Paul Levesque, respectively. Then, he is shown in his early days in WWE as Hunter Hearst Helmsley, the American Blueblood, wrestling some local talent in different towns. It chronicles his first singles title win, the Intercontinental Championship, winning it from Marc Mero in 1996. He then is shown winning King of The Ring 1997 from Mankind (Mick Foley) with Chyna at his side. He then is seen against Owen Hart for his European Title at Wrestlemania 14. He also faces Mankind (Mick Foley) again a couple of times, one match which results in him winning his first of 12 World Titles. He is seen in matches against Shawn Michaels, Batista, John Cena, Edge, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Nature Boy Ric Flair and Henry O. Godwinn, most of which he wins and wins the WWE or World Heavyweight Championship. There is a bit about his days in Degeneration-X and Evolution, but not a great deal. More about D-X can be found a separate DVD set. He is also seen as Number 22 entrant into the 2002 Royal Rumble, which he wins. There is also footage shown of his first match, against Flying Tony Roy, which is part of the rather skimpy extras on this set. I would give this set about a 4 1/2 out of five stars for the terrific compendium of his career, but I would've liked to see more extras.

WWE really worked hard on the cover of this DVD. The dual layers give it a 3-D look and the artwork itself is amazing. All matches are in full, except one, for your viewing pleasure.

-Disk 1-

This DVD begins by The Game talking about how he got to WWE to start with. He talks about his training and time with WCW.

Raw- 5/22/95
Hunter Hearst Helmsley VS John Crystal
This is the WWE Debut of Triple H under the blue blood gimmick. It's your regular squash type match with not much to it. Triple H does a good job with his debut though. Look for Triple H using a Cutter for his finisher.
RATING- 3/10

After his debut match, Triple H talks about the pressure behind working with local talent. He then goes on to talk about the honor of holding the Intercontinental title at that time.

Raw- 10/21/1996
WWF Intercontinental Championship
Hunter Hearst Helmsley VS Marc Mero(c) w/Mr. Perfect
This match was originally supposes to be HHH VS Mr. Perfect, but Perfect was injured. Perfect handpicked HHH's opponent for the night though. The match is well paced but doesn't come off that great. Mero hits a good-looking moonsault.
RATING- 7.5/10

Triple H talks about how Chyna became his bodyguard and how much of a change it was for the wrestling industry. He talks about being held back for a while but then coming back to win King of the Ring. He tells a funny story about the crown.

WWF King of the Ring 1997
Finals of the King of the Ring
Mankind VS Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna
Oddly enough, these guys put on a horrible match. The match itself was very slow and boring. The match does pick up until near the end. The end foreshadows what they are capable of doing in the future. Either way, it lasts way to long and is very boring.
RATING- 4/10

Triple H speaks on his transformation to becoming more like himself.

WWF WrestleMania XIV
WWF European Championship
Owen Hart VS Triple H(c) w/Chyna
It is nice to see Owen Hart on DVD. Chyna had to be handcuffed is Commissioner Slaughter during this match so she would not interfere. Triple H and Hart have a decent wrestling match. Nothing too special, but a good match regardless. Chyna makes her presence known regardless of the stipulation.
RATING-7.5/10

Triple h speaks on creating his own D-X and how D-X went from heels to faces in one day. Triple H then talks about his turn on D-X and elevation to the Main Event.

Raw- 8/23/1999
WWF Championship Match
Mankind(C) VS Triple H
Look what Triple H is wearing during his entrance. It looks sort of cool but at the same time very lame. The match itself isn't great. This was a way to get the title on Triple H for the first time and carry a bunch of heat with it. The Rock's commentary is the best part of the match.
RATING- 6/10

Triple h talks about being in the Main Event. He goes on to tell about how many times he has worked with Austin.

WWF No Mercy 1999
No Holds Barred- WWF Championship
Triple H(c) VS Stone Cold Steve Austin
What a fight these two had. They brawl all over the place. There are many weapons used in this match. This match is fast and furious and you won't forget it.
RATING- 9/10

Between these matches, Triple H talks about his on-air relationship with Stephanie McMahon and the McMahon's in general. He also talks about wanting to do Mick Foley justice in his retirement match.

WWF No Way Out 2000
Hell in a Cell- Career VS WWF Championship

Cactus Jack has been given one more chance at the title, but if he loses then he must retire. This is a great match from top to bottom. Triple H has locked the cell doors with dozens of locks so Cactus can't climb to the top and fly off onto Triple H as Cactus has been saying he would. The match does start a little too slowly, but eventually picks and gets brutal.
RATING- 9/10

Triple H talks about his injury from 2001 and how his return went.

WWE Royal Rumble 2002
30-Man Royal Rumble Match
This was the worst way to put this match on the DVD. You start in the middle of the match when Triple H enters the ring. You miss a lot of good things that went on during the Rumble. You do get to see Curt Hennig in action, which is nice. I felt like this was a waste of DVD space due to it not being the full rumble.
RATING- 4/10

-Disc 2-

Triple H talks about the return of Shawl Michaels to the ring and how he was the only one Shawn trusted to have a match with. The match they had at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-SummerSlam-2002/dp/B00006LPHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE SummerSlam 2002</a>&nbsp;would lead into our next match.

WWE Armageddon 2002
2 out of 3 Falls Match- World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H VS Shawn Michaels(c)
This match is amazing. Every single part of it was perfect. The first fall was a Street Fight that was absolutely brutal. A flaming barbwire board comes into play and connects with one of the best shots I've ever seen. It is also cool how the barbwire becomes lighted. The next fall is a Steel Cage match. The cage match just continues the brutality and sees Flair get involved. The third fall is a Ladder Match. The entire first and second fall is setting up the climax to the third fall. It's amazing how they could keep me guessing the entire match when it was going to happen. It is like something you'd see in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>, where something is being built toward the entire time but you don't know what it is until it happens. Yeah, I just compared wrestling to Saw, odd right?

It's back and forth action all the way. A steel chair wrapped in Barbwire is introduced early and becomes the focus point of the match. Steel steps are also used with the utmost brutality. The ending is so well done.

Triple Threat- WWE Championship
John Cena(c) VS Triple H VS Edge
This is a very good Triple Threat match. Cena and Triple H team up on Edge a lot. There is a huge triple turnbuckle move and many other 3-man moves. Triple H is bleeding all over the place. The ending is nice considering it's not the same old ending we always see in Cena matches.
RATING- 8.5/10

Triple H finishes up the DVD with how he would like to be remembered and wh he is going to keep on wrestling as long as he can.

Extras Included-

I am not sure why this match is put on here. I guess it is a contrast Triple H of 1995 to the Triple H of today.

There are a lot of matches on this dvd set I have always wanted to see but I was too cheap to buy the ppvs that the matches was shown on.  The only problem I had with the dvd set was there no matches with the Rock, Kurt Angle, the Undertaker, or Randy Orton.  I mean Vince is doing the right thing by releasing dvds on his three top guys in the late 90s and early 2000s.  Guys who basically save him in during that timeline.  It is good to see them include matches from early on in his career first as the blue bood and then to see him go from that to the King of Kings.",1206576000,,679,3.7535211267605635

8582550,4,B00CJGP15C,"People either love Triple H or hate him, but no one can deny that the man is a a true legend in the wrestling business. ""The Game"" was a major player in the Attitude era and continued his dominance throughout the 2000's. This two disc set, released back in 2007 attempts to give a complete overview of Triple H's career up until that point. For the most part, it succeeds. All the major points, from Triple H's WWE debut through his memorable feuds with Stone Cold, Mick Foley, HBK and others. While the match selection is quite strong, I feel that WWE could have easily produced a 3 disc set of matches. However, that's a minor complaint, as what is in the set is very good.

Triple H is interviewed before each match and gives very good insight about what was going on with his career in that particular point, as well as highlighting the significance of each match. Whether you're a fan of the Cerebral Assassin or not, you cannot agrue that the man doesn't love the business and what he does, and that passion shines throughout each interview clip.

Disc One:

Vs John Crystal (Raw 5/22/95) - Nothing special to this match. Trips debuts in his ""Greenwich Snob"" gimmick and dominates the match before picking up the pinfall. Mostly here for its historical significance. 2/5

WWE Intercontinental Championship Match - vs Marc Mero (Raw. 10/21/96) - Triple H was relatively solid in the ring at this point, and Mero was a solid worker. The main story of the match was Mr. Perfect aligning himself with Helmsley. Decent match. 2/5

King of the Ring Final - vs Mankind (King of the Ring. 6/8/97) - Triple H had picked up a lot of momentum by this point and he and Chyna were a great villianous pairing. The deranged Mankind had gained the fan's sympathy during his feud with Triple H and the crowd really seemed to want Mankind to win. Of course, it was not meant to be, as Triple won the KOTR and began his rise to the top. Foley and The Game have great chemistry and this match is no exception. Great action and some great post-match heel work by HHH. 4/5

WWE European Championship Match - vs Owen Hart (Wrestlemania 14. 3/29/98) - The story here was that Chyna would be handcuffed to Commissioner Slaughter so that she wouldn't interfere. The Attitude era was gaining a lot of momentum by WM 14 and Triple H, as a member of DX, was a huge part. He and Owen worked a solid, back and forth technical match before Chyna eventually interfered and help Triple H defeat Owen for the title. A solid midcard match at Mania. 3/5

WWE Championship Match - vs Mankind (Raw is War. 8/23/99) Taking place the night after Summerslam, Triple squared off against Mankind for the WWE championship that he had won the previous night. It's a typical Attitude era match, with lots of brawling and little technical wrestling. That being said, the action was solid and Triple H captured his first WWE championship. 3/5

No Holds Barred Match for the WWE Championship - vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (No Mercy. 10/17/99) - I remember the build up to this match extremely well. Triple H had injured Austin's knee back at Summerslam and Austin was hell bent on gaining revenge and winning the WWE title. He even went as far as to throw Triple H into a locker room shower, where a live rattlesnack was waiting. Triple H showed up the next week with a massive wound on his face and appeared to forefit the WWE title to Stone Cold. After telling The Game that he didn't want to win it this way, HHH replied ""Well, you're gonna get it this way."" and blasted Austin with the belt. He then peeled his wound off and revealed the entire ruse. Stone Cold is my all time favorite wrestler and HHH was so great as a heel that I genuinely hated him and wanted Austin to beat his ass good. It's another basic Attitude era match, with lots of brawling into the stands and around the ringside era, but it left a huge impression on my 11 year old mind. Doesn't really hold up well, but I love this match personally. 4/5

Career vs Title WWE Championship Hell in a Cell Match - vs Cactus Jack (No Way Out. 2/27/00) - The final chapter in the epic Mick Foley/HHH feud, HHH put the title on the line against Jack's career inside the demonic cell. This match truly has it all: Great, stiff brawling, techinical wrestling, blood, drama, storytelling, memorable spots (the flaming 2x4, HHH backdropping Cactus through the cell), just a wild, amazing match. Mick Foley goes out in style and HHH is made as a main event player for the next decade. 5/5

Royal Rumble Match (Royal Rumble. 1/20/02) Triple H made his triumphant return from his quad injury to win the Rumble and head off to Wrestlemania. The match picks up from Triple H's entrance on, so we get to witness some great action from HHH, Stone Cold, Kurt Angle, and the returning Mr. Perfect. The 2002 Royal Rumble is my personal favorite Rumble match. There were just so many big stars that it felt like a huge match. 5/5

Disc Two:

3 Stages of Hell Match for the World Heavyweight Championship - vs Shawn Michaels (Armageddon. 12/15/02) HBK (the greatest of all time) returned back at Summerslam in an amazing non sanctioned match against HHH. This was the return match with Shawn's WHC on the line. These two had amazing chemistry with each other and this match ranks amongst the best of both of their careers. The first fall is a street fight, the 2nd a steel cage match, and the 3rd a ladder match. Lots of brutality, as HBK's surgically repaired back takes some nasty bumps in this match. Great action the entire duration and flies by for it's 30+ min. duration. I personally love this match. 5/5

Hell in a Cell Match for the World Heavyweight Championship - vs Batista (Vengeance. 6/26/05) Absolutley brutal HIAC match that features several stiff weapon shots and buckets of blood. HHH really put Batista over as a main eventer back in 2005 and I think this is the best match in their rivalry. 5/5

Last Man Standing Match - vs Ric Flair (Survivor Series. 11/27/05) - Everyone knows that HHH is a huge Ric Flair fan and it's no secret that he and Flair are close. The two had a very personal rivalry back in 2005 after the breakup of Evolution and this was the capper to the feud. Flair was very limited, offense wise, during his last WWE tenture, so it was up to HHH to carry the match. I feel like he did a great job and really beat down Flair so that the crowd really bought into Flair's comeback and believing that he stood a chance. A solid match all things considered. 4/5

Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship - vs John Cena and Edge (Backlash. 4/30/06) A great triple threat match from three of the best superstars of all time. HHH and Cena spend the early moments beating down Edge before focusing on each other. The match breaks down into several one on one combinations but also contains some great multi-man spots. This was when the anti-Cena movement was at its peak, so tht crowd really wanted either HHH or Edge to pull out the victory. Great match. 5/5

Final Thoughts:
This is a well put together dvd set. The match listing is strong and I enjoyed hearing HHH speak about his career throughout. However, there are some glaring ommisions from the match listing. No matches against The Rock? Chris Jericho? The Undertaker? Kurt Angle? Barely any mention of his time in DX? Most of the matches on this set are not on other dvd sets, but the fact that they made it a 2 disc instead of a 3 disc hurts the rating for me, as a lot of great matches could have been added.

Overall: 4/5",1350259200,,7522,4.490855888807608
8582551,3,B00CJGP15C,"Triple H is one of my favorite wrestlers. He is a powerful force in WWE and has been since around 98. Why does his DVD suck? The documentary isn't in-depth, well it's actually not even a documentary, due to H just talking about little things for a few minutes before the footage rolls into a match. The formula is: h talks, then a match, h talks, then a match; so we aren't getting a real treatment of H's story.

While the match listing is fair, it's the only thing saving this DVD. The DVD set is only two discs long. Many, many, many more matches could have been included on this set, but WWE settled on 14 matches. These 14 matches are excellent matches, but I wanted more. The Game deserves to have a longer, fuller, in-depth DVD. This DVD did not deliver the goods.

What I like about the dvd are: Triple H's comments between the matches, the matches, and the alternative commentary by HHH and J.R. on one of his early matches.

What I don't like: that Triple H wasn't given a full, sit-down interview documentary style and sub-par amount of matches on this set.

For what it is, I recommend the DVD to any wrestling and/or HHH fan.",1340236800,,1138,4.37914691943128
8582552,1,B00CJGP15C,"Triple H is a truly mediocre performer. No athleticism, little technical skill, and minimal strength for a man his size. People defend this talentless goon by saying that he has great psychology, but so do 99% of wrestlers who make it to the top. Bob Dylan fans defend Dylan as a ""great songwriter"" in order to paper over his vocal and musical failings, when genuinely gifted musos like Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney were also great songwriters.

Triple H has had well-documented issues with the likes of Bret Hart and The Rock, and to a lesser extent, Chris Jericho and The Undertaker. What do these men have in common? They were all great athletes and performers, WHO EARNED EVERY WORLD TITLE THEY HAD. All of them have less world titles than Triple H, of course, the man who self-booked the highest number of WWE world titles in history. How did he manage that? He latched onto Nash and Michaels upon arrival in 1995, and when they were gone, moved his lips to the asses of the incredibly-over New Age Outlaws, whom he used to bolster himself. When the new DX fell apart, he slithered his weedy little johnson into Stephanie.

It's a real laugh that, during the early-to-mid 2000s, the announcers were instructed to refer to this hack as ""the best in the business"" at a time when the likes of Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and others were on the roster. Anyone who thinks that this mediocre parasite really ranks as an all-time great alongside the men I've mentioned in this review, really has fallen for WWE propaganda over the years.",1325030400,3,1558,4.7032967032967035
