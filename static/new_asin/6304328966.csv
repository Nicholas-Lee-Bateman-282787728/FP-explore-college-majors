Sets are good, clothes are divoon, lots of really funny moments... like when Douglas repeatedly gets into line to kiss the bride.  It's a fast-moving, entertaining flick all round.  5 sparkling stars!",1448496000,,342,4.745762711864407

7867871,5,6304328966,I love watching Joan Crawford in her early movies. I also like to see her in comedies. She is very good at drama and comedy. I enjoyed this movie but then I love older movies and older Hollywood stars,1425600000,,200,4.153846153846154

Joan Crawford was excellent in this movie portraying as a boss of a large movie company, never been married and then meets this guy which causes her knees to buckle upon seeing him. Quite funny movie overall.",1394841600,,373,4.267605633802817
7867873,4,6304328966,"Joan Crawford succeeds with a great screenplay and great performances by every single actor, especially Melvyn Douglas and Billie Burke as Mel's best pal's wife. She's absolutely sensational.

White collar meets blue, referee is Douglas, the struggling, but insightful hipster writer, with no ""wheels"" of his own but vicariously as advocate for all the truck rivers in Joan's very successful trucking company. He's no Clark Gable  but can match him with his resonant voice and smooth moves.

Story is that MGM loaned Joan to Columbia and for this Reviewer a very happy medium results: she brings the style and elegance of MGM to a company that is expert in making entertaining and energetic comedies.

We have a minor classic on our hands until a little after ""intermission"" and then we suddenly drop from A to B movie as Joan the Corporate Riser gets bombed at a company party (not for the suits....see the movie!), rediscovers her ""womanhood"" and suddenly wants Melvin, the annoying guy who early in their association seemed to want nothing more than to collect on an accident claim related to her firm.

Movie is still recommended. Actually has some progressive (for the time) stuff - could make it today as a stage property!",1370995200,,1228,4.941747572815534

What do all these movies have in common? Just like, ""They all Kissed the Bride"" they were all made in the early 40's (towards the end of Ms. Crawford's MGM career.) And, just like ""They All Kissed The Bride"" all of these movies are absolutely dreadful and extremely painful to watch. But unlike the others, ""They All Kissed The Bride"" is different.

This movie was different for a few reasons. First of all, Joan was on loan to Columbia (it was only the 2nd or 3rd time MGM lent her out for a ""talkie."") And, I have to be honest. This was a really, really bad movie. And not only was it a bad movie, but  it was a bad movie that Joan was bad in.

I also had difficulty following the movie and understanding it. Maybe, because the plot was incredibly dry. Except for a few funny lines with Joan and Billie Burke, the majority of the movie was very slow-moving and terribly over-dramatic.

In 1942, Joan was going through a really rough time, personally and professionally. Her studio was feeding her sub-standard scripts with one hand while trying to push her out the door with the other. This movie was the last thing on Joan's agenda. But she did it out of loyalty to her good friend, Carole Lombard, who died in a plane crash. Ms. Crawford donated her entire salary to charity and then fired her manager when he didn't do the same (how many of today's Hollywood stars do this?) That's a rhetorical question, because we all know the answer is none.",1192406400,6,1903,5.73758865248227
7867875,4,6304328966,"""They All Kissed the Bride"" (1941) is a noteworthy film as first, being a comedy from Joan Crawford, and second, as the film Carole Lombard was scheduled to do at the time of her death.

Crawford, never judged a comedienne at any time in her career, does a very commendable job in what could have been a bland role.  She plays the part of M.J. Drew, a hard as nails businesswoman, to perfection and doesn't skip a beat by overplaying the character once she gets weak kneed over Michael Holmes (Melvyn Douglas).  Seeing Crawford in the part, it's hard to imagine Lombard in the role, sparkling comedienne though she unquestionably was.  You could imagine Bette Davis, perhaps, as the strictly business M.J., but only Myrna Loy, in my judgment, could have done as much justice to the role as Crawford does, as both a driven businesswoman and a lovestruck lady.

Although M.J.'s background isn't mentioned much, other than the fact that she inherited her trucking business from her deceased father, one could expect that M.J. was the son he never had and treated as such, whereas younger sister Vivian was the babied Daddy's Girl.  Which makes M.J. ripe for Michael Holmes and his forthright behavior.  Has anyone ever stood up to M.J. before?  Probably not.  And maybe that is part of M.J.'s fascination with Michael.

Although Crawford deserves kudos for her comedy, Melvyn Douglas simply shines.  Not only was he an incredibly talented, and sadly underrated, actor, but he and Crawford meshed well together and had a great chemistry.  Not the electrifying, sexually charged chemistry she shared with Gable, but more a meeting of the minds, of personality.  It's not easy to take the spotlight from such a performer as Crawford but Douglas does it with ease.  He seems comfortable and at home playing reporter Michael Holmes and both he and Crawford seem to be having a good time with their roles.

It's a shame that MGM didn't recognize that Crawford could, on occasion and with the right part and co-star, handle some lighthearted comedic roles  - - she shone in MGM's ""The Women"" and ""Susan and God"" (although this film was sorely underrated and perhaps undermarketed).  She may have been able to turn in some other sparkling performances but, alas, only the women's films and horror awaited her post-MGM.

If you are a Crawford fan, this film is definitely worth viewing and adding to your library.  If you are unfamiliar with Melvyn Douglas, this is a great film to get to know his work and appreciate his acting and comedy chops.

Definitely recommended.",1142380800,4,2559,4.852534562211981
7867876,3,6304328966,"Margaret J. Drew, known as M.J. by her intimidated employees, has taken over command of the vast Drew financial empire from her late father. When reporter Michael Holmes begins to publish exposes about Drew's tyrannical employment practices, the imperious M.J. demands that he be investigated. A pretty enjoyable film considering its rather contrived storyline, it nevertheless should please the mulititude of fans who still see in Crawford something I don't personally - generally speaking. The film was originally to have starred Carole Lombard, but she was tragically killed in a airplane crash after a highly successful War Bond drive. The script was re-written to suit Joan of Crawford. To her credit, Joanie donated her entire salary for this film to various charities in memory of the much-loved Lombard. As trivia footnotes, cinematographer used a special new ""lavender lighting"" technique which was used as an experiment in order to enhance the brilliance of Crawford's eyes (!) The film's ending credits acknowledge thusly: ""Miss Joan Crawford appears through the courtesy of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"". The working title of the film was HE KISSED THE BRIDE & a deleted piece of dialogue ran: ""When I want a sneak, I'll hire the best and get a Jap!""...Definitely politically incorrect by today's standards!",1045958400,3,1310,5.364077669902913
7867877,5,6304328966,"Joan Crawford took this role after the original star, Carole Lombard, was killed in an airplane crash.  She donated her entire salary to the war effort when it was completed.  She quickly wins my attention in the movie,  because she plays the role so well.  She wants success, and having to deal  with a flighty mother and sister makes her job very difficult.  Her  nemesis, played so well by Melvyn Douglas, slowly wins her heart and falls  for her himself. It is fun to watch the younger Miss Crawford play the  hard-nosed type that she certainly was associated with later in her career.  She hits her marks well within the movie, and she seemed very comfortable  with her frequent costar Mr. Douglas.  Even though it has the typical  Hollywood ending (which I personally enjoy very much), it is well worth  your time to watch.  Sit back, relax, and laugh at the foibles of these  unique characters.",948844800,18,901,4.67948717948718
