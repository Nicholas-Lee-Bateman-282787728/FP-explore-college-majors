Its a great workout (joints don't hurt)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sneiders-Perfect-Rebounding-Workout/dp/B000HWXAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout</a>at any age and since I am 63...I can pause the workout to catch my breath.  The more I workout, the less I have to catch my breath. Fantastic to keep the lymphatic system moving to rid your body of toxins. I have also been using the same rebounder I purchased from the Sneiders since 2000.",1275350400,2,645,5.924731182795699
8141552,1,B000HWXAG2,"This DVD is dated and boring. A friend told me to try a rebounding DVD becasue they were a lot of fun.  She and I are both in pretty good shape.  This was clearly geared to seniors, or people not accustomed to exercise.  I did the CD once and won't use it again.  I could get a better workout just rebounding on my own while watching TV.",1179360000,12,337,3.985074626865672
8141553,5,B000HWXAG2,"Ordered this DVD for some workout diversity.  Currently use Carol Brophy's  rebounding DVD.  Like it a lot.  This one though......AWESOME.  Really gives you a great workout.  Have been rebounding since mid-December; very effective.  This workout DVD encompasses weight resistance, cardio and the benefits of rebounding.  GREAT ab routine at the end as well; also, teaches some stretching techniques.  Recommend this.  By the way, ""they"" use REAL people in the DVD.  All shapes, sizes, genders and ages!  Nice touch.",1173744000,18,515,5.461538461538462
8141554,5,B000HWXAG2,"Long time fitness pioneers Harry and Sarah Sneider put together this original 20 Minute Workout rebounding video years ago in Hawaii.  I have been using it ever since!  I'm so glad it's now on DVD.  It has kept me in good health over the years.  It's simple, easy and fun!  I like the fact that there are real people in the video, both men and women, some older, some younger, and they are all having fun.  I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting better health with more energy, balance, and strength.  The Sneiders' new DVD Resistance Rebounding is fabulous, but I still like to use this 20 Minute Workout also for variety.  And, I like the added Pilates and easy Yoga stretch segments included, too.",1165968000,9,700,4.544
8141555,2,B000HWXAG2,"I was really disappointed in Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout.  I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the Urban Rebounding Compilation DVDs.

The first sign of trouble was in the beginning interview on the tape, which showed the host, presumably Dr. Sneider, with a gigantic pot belly.  That isn't the role model I was looking for.

To be honest, if you do the workout on this video, you will get a good overall workout.  But the video is so repetitious, completely lacking in enthusiasm, downright boring, and unprofessionally produced.  For the rebounding part, it does the same very few movements, not very imaginitive, over and over.  When changing from one movement to another, the camera is almost never focused on the teacher's feet to see what she is doing, so you can only guess.  The ""class"" consists of a bunch of totally out of shape, rhythmically-challenged people on the front lawn of the Royal Hawaiian hotel.  They don't exercise in unison at all, and the camera is usually on them, not on the teacher.  You must have hand weights to do the program.

For the abs part of the program, during much of it the cameraman forgot to focus the camera at all.  The two people are just blurs.  Also, there is just no point at all in doing your abs or yoga or pilates moves on a rebounder.  It is downright uncomfortable to do so, and you can get a much better workout by doing them on a mat, without injuring yourself on the hard rebounder frame.  While the exercises in the abs and yoga parts were good, I strongly recommend getting a different non-rebounding DVD, like Candlelight Yoga (very excellent) with Sara Ivanhoe.  That has many of the same moves as the yoga part of this workout, but safe, well taught, professionally photographed, and above all, ENTHUSIASM.

This was just a very, very boring, repetitious exercise video.  The Urban Rebounding compilations are not perfect, but they are MUCH better.",1160438400,63,1929,4.759036144578313
