5242374,4,B004BLIMV8,"This 2-pack featuring Wall Street(released Dec/87),and its follow up Money never Sleeps(released May/14),is a very enjoyable duo of films by director Oliver Stone. I think the first film has it by a nose,but the second comes on a strong second.
Wall Street stars,among others,Michael Douglas,Charlie Sheen,Daryl Hannah and Martin Sheen. Gordon Gekko(Douglas)is the Wall Street tycoon every young trader on Wall Street wants to be,especially his ardent admirer Budd Fox(Sheen).Fox is in a dead end position where he works and one day he finagles his way into an interview with Gekko. Gekko ultimately has enough of an interest in Fox to take him under his wing. Fox's biggest bit of ""leverage""is the airline his father works for. With some inside knowledge of upcoming events that Fox provides Gekko,Gekko is able to buy the struggling airline,promising to turn it around. However when negotiations between the unions(Fox's father represents one of them)and Gekko don't go well,he decides to chop it up and sell it. Fox is totally betrayed,who in turn has betrayed his father's trust. In a desperate act of revenge he approaches a rival of Gekko's who is more than willing to come in and take control of the airline. When Gekko learns of Fox's antics he is beside himself. Fox,walking into work the following day,is arrested and charged with illegal inside trading by the official stock watch-dogs who follow the market. In a meeting in Central park between Gekko and Fox,Gekko punches Fox to the ground for what he did. Fox just walks away. We soon after see why. He was wired for sound by the authorities who now also arrest Gekko. The film ends as Fox,with a clear conscience,walks up the courthouse steps to his fate.
This film was well acted and paced as the plot goes back and forth,and is like watching a well scripted chess game. Stone keeps the intrigue going and the tension builds steadily throughout. The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,a featurette,trailer and TV spots.
The Money Never Sleeps,stars,among others,Michael Douglas,Shia LaBeouf,Josh Brolin,Carey Mulligan and Frank Langella. The story begins in 2001 when Gekko is let out of prison after serving an eight year sentence. No one is there to meet him. Seven years later he is hawking a self penned book on money making. We are next introduced to a couple,Jacob Moore,LaBeouf,a top trader in an old firm,and his fiance'Carey Mulligan,Winnie Gekko. Moore's company suddenly finds itself being attacked from outside rumours and its stock plummets. It's head Louis Zabel(Langella)is at the end of his rope. A consortium of banks led by Bretton James,Brolin,refuses to extend him any time and offers to buy him out with just pennies on the dollar. Bretton was faced with a similar situation years before and Zabel was the one then who refused to back HIM.Revenge is sweet...or is it? On the way to work the next morning Zabel commits suicide,and Moore is totally devastated. Now Moore is on the revenge track. Parallel to this is Moore's involvement with Gekko,who he has seen off and on. Both come to an agreement that if Moore can get Gekko's estranged daughter back for him,Gekko will in turn,turn over $100,000,000 Gekko put into a Swiss account in his glory days under his daughters name,to Moore to invest in a pet project he has,re fusion technology. Winnie and Moore go to Switzerland and complete the paperwork. However when it comes time to get the money as promised,Gekko has skipped the country with it. To top this Moore and Winnie end up splitting up because of the pressure. Moore meanwhile has also weaseled his way into Bretton's company and confidence,trying to gain information he can use against him. Eventually he turns over all the information he has accumulated on Bretton's companies bailout,and the reasons Zabel's company went under,over to Winnie,who runs a small news webpage. She agrees to run it and it goes viral. Bretton's company now goes down the tubes,stock price wise. Gekko,with his money,buys up a good portion of the stock and turns the $100 million into over a $1 billion! In the end Gekko turns over the initial $100 million back to Moore to invest in his pet project and reconciles with his daughter,who in turn has reconciled with Moore.
The film certainly has a lot of twists and turns to it,but Stone once more is able to keep ones interest piqued throughout. This picture,in a lesser director's hands,would have failed miserably. Watch for a brief return appearance by Charlie Sheen. The film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and commentary.
All in all an enjoyable two pack of both Wall Street movies that most will find quite enjoyable. Oliver Stone deftly weaves his directorial hand over both films and they come out winners. Recommended.",1390003200,,4854,4.957055214723926

5242381,5,B004BLIMV8,"Loved both films (Wall Street and Money Never Sleeps). It was fun to see how far the tech and the schemes have come between the two films.

I will agree that in Money Never Sleeps, one does ask why Gecko's daughter is dating a Wall St boy.

Also, you get to see Charlie Sheen before he went off the deep-end.",1307577600,2,308,4.116666666666666

8534351,4,B004BLIMV8,"This is a Classic Double Set. I'm an avid fan of Cinema and a Collector of Any Movie that I want to watch more than once or twice. Saying that the movies I began collecting on DVD some I purchased on Bluray. With this set I was Excited to own for although I owned the original 1985 Wall Street on DVD and the quality was poor. When I received this set it was so much better. As I inserted the 2nd Disc to watch Money Never Sleeps This Message Popped up "" This Disc has been Coded for Region B ONLY and Will Not Play on Region A Bluray Players.""
So I tried another Bluray Player along with my Playstation and I have yet to be able to watch the 2nd Disc in this Double Feature Set. The Original film ""Wall Street"" Plays With No Problems.
If anyone at Amazon knows anything I'd like to exchange this set for one that I can watch both movies. So b I give the Quality 4 Stars but take Away 1 Star for Inability to Watch 2nd Movie.",1460246400,,925,4.005405405405406
