There's no housekeeper, there's no keys to  the kingdom, and Beauty and the former Beast don't live forever.  However,  the narrator does say that Beauty's father comes to live with them, the  former Beast is a prince, and they all live happily ever after.  This  version of Beauty and the Beast isn't as beautiful a movie as Disney's, but  it's a lot closer to the original story.  The songs are a lot of fun, the  Beast's servants are pretty funny, and the Beast himself has a great sense  of humor.",965520000,3,607,4.477064220183486
