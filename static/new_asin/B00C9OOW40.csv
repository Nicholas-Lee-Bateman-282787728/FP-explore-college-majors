5708233,5,B00C9OOW40,"This is a very well done example of it's type. A goodly amount of nudity but nothing hardcore and a recognizable plot. There are a succession of rather indifferent women until Amy Hesketh gets her turn but she is well worth the wait. She is an excellent, very believable actress within the context of this kind of movie. She in fact has lots of experience doing torture films for Red Feline under the name Jane. She is fairly attractive, not particularly pretty but admits going to the gym and her body shows it. She can scream and writhe with the best of them. And she really gives you the feeling you are watching an intimate scene between two lovers. Some of the other characters are less effective, especially Jac, as Bluebeard, who unfortunately must be in just about every scene. But if you like this kind of stuff you'll love Amy. She really salvages the scene where he ties her up on the bed and is excellent in the final scene where she is killed. That's not really a spoiler, the plot is after all pretty predictable: Bluebeard meets a sequence of women and murders them. Amy is by far the best of the lot.",1374451200,17,1116,4.4487804878048784

No, that wasn't a mistake. That's the way most of the movie goes.

It starts when Barbuzal marries a woman, she threatens to leave, he kills her, decides he likes it.

Lots of nudity and soft-core sex.

But his latest bride-to-be finds his diary and reads it while Mr. B is fetching her sister for a visit. Will he kill her? Kill them? Neither?

7/10 Stars. Review by S.E. (on IMDB.com)

Recommended for (1) mature audiences who (2) enjoy literary, paced horror (with healthy doses of disturbing erotica):  This graphic tale aims to disturb in elegant fashion. Note firstly that the script is an adaption of a classic fairy tale La Barbe Bleue (Bluebeard, 1697) by Charles Perrault. Most folks in 2014 in the USA will not recognize his name, but he authored many famous tales translated to the movie screen (i.e.,Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Puss in Boots, and The Sleeping Beauty). Here, Bluebeard tells the story of a wealthy aristocrat who kills his many fiancees.

Beautiful Serial Killing: Bluebeard appropriately plays like the Sweeney Todd play. Viewers watch as victim after victim are taken to Barbazuls remote plantation to suffer an unsuspecting death. The pacing is measured; the music and strange situations carry the film. The beautiful remote setting and filming was reminiscent of the cinematography of the Coen Brothers Fargo (1996) and Stanley Kubricks rendition of Stephen Kings The Shining (1980).  About ~10 minutes could have been shaved off the first third without lessening anything, so impatient viewers may lose interest.

The acting, writing, casting, and filming were all well done. The music score did overwhelm voices at times (at least on the version I streamed); however, despite the writing being good enough to listen to, the occasional dimmed conversation didn't detract from the film.  For one, I was reading the subtitles anyway.  Also, the acting is clear enough that this could have been presented as a silent movie (keeping the wondrous soundtrack of course).
Each victim arguable has more character depth than the titular Barbazul. They all have some artistic bent (poor model, mature model, singer, writer, museum goer), which reinforces the artistic nature of the film. Each death is intimately, and vividly, captured at length.  Despite the cruel nature of the deaths, and the copious amounts of exposed flesh, the blood and gore was kept at minimal levels; in short, the murders are done tastefully. The beauty of each woman is torturously lost as viewers become voyeurs to fatal sex. Bizarre, really.

Excerpt: Creating horror with beauty is a tough task, yet screen writer Amy Hesketh (also Director and actress for Jane) seems to reveal the movies core theme explicitly:
Barbazul: So, do you enjoy modelling?
Annabelle: I am enjoying the fact that I am still beautiful. I love taking photos, looking at my photos. Its something that will last forever. Its artistic as well. Using your body, knowing how to move, knowing yourself. To understand your own beauty isnot that easy
Art Horror: The film crew at Pachamama Films have made a series of complex horror films, each being unapologetic about graphically killing naked women. Yet they aim to keep rooted in history or classic literary works, and they take their craft seriously. Somehow they present loads of erotic horror in a beautiful way; that is a stunning balancing act. I look forward to their film currently in production called ""Olalla,"" which is based off of Robert Louis Stevensons story (Treasure Island, and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.) That tale originally featured an English soldier recovering from battle wounds when he falls in love with a woman who belongs to a mysterious vampiric family. Cant wait to see the Pachamama adaptation of Olalla.

Availability (2014, US): DVDs in the US run ~$35; buying a streamable version from Amazon is ~$20.",1398556800,5,3562,5.145328719723183
