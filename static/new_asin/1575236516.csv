7798829,5,1575236516,One of my favorite 90's gems....too bad there is no decent US release.,1490918400,,70,4.461538461538462
7798830,5,1575236516,Very cool movie not the thinking man's plot but entertaining enough to watch over and over again,1455753600,,96,4.705882352941177
7798831,5,1575236516,"Hello everyone, I must say, I agree with other individuals about Mark  playing Neo  for the matrix. I am a die-hard Jackie Chan film collector and  I must say, as a fellow martial artist, I think Marks movements are  graceful. The first time I watched drive, I ran out and bought it to add to  my collection. Mark probably doesn't get the recognition he deserves but  this movie made up for that. This is the kind of movie that amplifies you,  like a kid, to go outside and play karate hero (like we used to do when the  wu-tang series would come on during saturday afternoons). I think he would  play an interesting villian in a possible Matrix 2, Romeo must die 2, or a  Jackie chan movie!",964483200,,691,4.328125
7798832,5,1575236516,"I watched this movie because of Mark Dacascos, he has to be one of the best Martial Arts Actor out there hes got it all, unfortunately most of his movies leaves a lot to be desired!  Drive however is in the Damn Good  category!
Mark plays a super soldier type running from his Bosses (the  bad guys), he meets up with Kadeem (the comic relief) where the dynamic duo  struggles against the nasties in this story.  Yes the plot is basic but  Mark more than makes up for it.  I agree with Dr Morpho, Mark Dacascos  would have made an excellent Neo (Keanus character, on Matrix), if only it  were true!
Watch this movie, it is an excellent introduction to Mark  Dacascos who should be world famous, but isnt!  so enjoy his wonderful  Martial Arts talent!",957571200,,750,4.4338235294117645
7798833,3,1575236516,"I got this movie thinking it would be a regular martial arts action movie. I was disappointed in Mark from the movie Double Dragon because I knew he has skills (Mark was great in ""Only the Strong""). I saw the movie and was blown away. Mark pulls out all the stops in this film. He uses technical and artistic blocks and punches really fast that you would have to watch it in slow motion to see the form. Each fight scene is well choreographed and the stunts were neat and a bit flashy. Imagine a Jackie Chan movie, then remove the goofy stuff and you get this. Plot is so-so, but who truly cares when it comes to these movies? Comedy wise, it was as entertaining as Ninja Turtles was, only with more profanity and some blood. Toby (Mark) is a Hong Kong agent and a prototype of some mechanism inside his upper body that helps him to be an incredible fighting machine. He wants out and hitches a ride on a boat to America. He is caught and gets away (this is where the movie begins). The 'bad guys' are after him and Toby runs into his sidekick (Kadeem Hardison - some guy I think I saw on the Cosby show once, funny attitude) and they try to get to LA to sell the mechanism, but they need to stay alive in the process. If this plot does not sound interesting enough, then the martial arts will make up for it.
This movie came out before the Matrix. In the movie some of the stunts towards the end use wire works in the action, but not ridiculously too much (a few weird scenes but they were short). The fight scenes start off well in the beginning and continue to get bigger and bigger towards the end. In the Matrix, Keanu annoyed me here and there. Mark proves to you that he should have been ""the one"".
If you care more about plot, then go for the Matrix. If want to see an actor who should have been Neo, see this movie.",955756800,,1824,4.184659090909091
7798834,5,1575236516,"By far the best movie ever made. Dacascos is the most unbelievable martial arts man in movie history.  Un -F*cking Believable.  This movie puts Chan, Van Damme, and anyone else in martial arts movies to shame. He moves like a  dancer and has moves like you've never seen before.",929923200,,278,4.63265306122449
