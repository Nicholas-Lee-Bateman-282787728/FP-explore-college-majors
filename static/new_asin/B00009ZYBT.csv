Gloria Araya-Quinlan has become a recent favorite instructor of mine, and I've been trying out several of her Tru2form DVDs.  I really enjoyed her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tru2form-Reggaeton/dp/B000BCXZWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tru2form - Reggaeton</a>&nbsp;and was expecting to have a great time and get a good workout with this DVD.  Unfortunately, it was quite different, having several flaws that kept it from being an effective workout.

The set was probably the quirkiest thing about ""Urban Heat.""  I don't think a construction site, complete with a ""Danger: High Voltage"" sign, is exactly the atmosphere I imagine working out in.  That fact that a taxi and random stop sign were in the background didn't seem very hip hop dancey at all.

However, the set doesn't determine how the workout is.  The instructor and her choreography are the true determining factors, and while I've liked Gloria in everything else I've seen her in, she was a bit too fake in this workout.  She seemed to be trying to hard to attain a ""cool"" swag/hip hop factor and make the workout like a music video.  That's not necessarily a bad idea, but the execution left much to be desired.  The camera was all over the place yet never at the right place.  When Gloria would be teaching a new upper body move, the camera would focus on the feet and vice versa.  I've reviewed many fitness DVDs, and this is first time I've ever complained about camera work.  It was bad.  On the other hand, the music was pretty good and didn't bore me.

As for the actual moves that Gloria taught, they were authentic hip hop moves and would be a blast to dance if only Gloria wouldn't teach them so badly.  She breaks down every single move (no matter the level of difficulty) really slowly and does it like that for about 4 times to make sure you have it.  While these moves were intricate, they weren't necessarily high impact and needed to be done up to tempo back to back in order to give a decent workout.  My heart rate never really got high because Gloria kept slowing things down for unnecessary amounts of times.

The format of the DVD is that after a warm-up, there are about 5 different combos (each with a different unique name) which each last about 5 minutes that Gloria will teach you one step at a time.  She will break down a move, like I said earlier, and add on one move at a time.  The moves need a generous amount of room to move...probably around 8 steps side-to-side and 4 steps forward.  Everything is probably what I'd classify as intermediate, although the constant slow-down makes the moves beginner friendly.  You end the workout with a cool down, which isn't very good; there aren't many stretches.

Overall, it's not the worst workout I've ever done, but it definitely needs some improvement.  The way the moves are taught isn't that great, and the production is a little strange; however, the moves are authentic and fun to master.  I'd recommend getting the Reggaeton DVD above this one, or if you're specifically a hip hop workout, I'd recommend either&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Fitness-for-Beginners-with-MaDonna-Grimes-Urban-Street-Heat/dp/B0006H31SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Fitness for Beginners with MaDonna Grimes: Urban Street Heat</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Hip-Hop-Dance-Mix/dp/B002ASVYOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Hip Hop Dance Mix</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Off-the-Inches-Cardio-Hip-Hop/dp/B003QLEARE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Off the Inches: Cardio Hip Hop</a>.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid that the bottom line is I don't really recommend this workout because there are so many better ones on the market.  I probably won't do this DVD again for a long time.",1341273600,,4049,5.591803278688524
7994841,5,B00009ZYBT,"I've had this DVD a while & love it. Yes, the camera moves to a smiling face or woman's upper torso when you want to see the face, but seems like 80% all fitness/dance workouts have that problem. The music has a great beat, not complex, but I've heard much worse & it did keep me moving.

She does say ""Beautiful! Now hold it here, for a min.. great job... I knew you could do it.. "" to an annoying amount, but it's just her way of encoraging her invisible audience.

MOST IMPORTANT: She does what most don't do: She starts a new move in half time & counting in it's most simple form, then adds to it slowly to it's complex finished look. Too many fitness-dance or reg dance workouts only do normal time, barely counting & not explaining anything such as Madonna Grimes's African Beat, Crunch's Dance Party or Crunch's Hip Hop workout.

There are 4 other female dancers, 2 along side her which look like they have had years of professional dance training & 2 young background girls who show the modified versions in the back.

There's a trailer at collagevideo com to see for yourself.",1110499200,12,1085,4.437185929648241
7994842,1,B00009ZYBT,"I bought this hoping to get a workout that was fun and a workout.  Besides being boring, my heart rate never really got moving.  After I was finished, I felt like it was a waste of my time, like I didn't burn any calories at all.  I should have gone for a run.  The dancers were not very good, and kept making mistakes.  The camera kept moving around, and you'd get shots of the dancers faces only...not helpful when trying to learn new choreography.  What a waste of money...don't buy this.",1078704000,19,491,4.34065934065934
7994843,2,B00009ZYBT,"I went to the store looking for a dance/cardio workout, because I get tired of the same ole routine.  I read the back of this DVD and it sounded really interesting.  Well, I started the DVD and I was very excited for the first 15 minutes.  I was keeping the beat and really having fun.  After that, it started moving really fast, without enough time for the ""dancer"" to learn the steps.  I had to reverse and play the steps several times before I thought I had it.
My other critique is that the cameraman did not show all the dancers.  He had a tendency to just focus in on some of the girl's faces, while Gloria was showing the steps.  Before I knew it, the ""dancer"" was supposed to be completing the steps, without any instruction.
Overall, the first part was fun, but I ended up disappointed with the second part.",1074556800,16,816,4.328947368421052
7994844,5,B00009ZYBT,"I thought that Gloria Araya-Quinlan did a fantastic job instructing in both Urban Heat and Latin Grooves.  My favorite is Latin Grooves because it's a really great time. Not only does she break down the steps in an easy to understand way, she totally motivates you by getting you in the mindset. The ""cool down"" segments are so enjoyable.",1062979200,6,338,4.728813559322034
