And in the crazy insane process, he meets a girl. Like Van Wilder on steroids, only....this movie has heart! And, a real story! The dialogue and situations are hilarious, the one liners CLASSIC!

6429644,5,B00KHW4X40,Good flick,1461024000,,10,4.5
6429645,4,B00KHW4X40,"It had a good plot and a surprising ability to surprise me.

What wasn't expected was the subtitles - in that they were CENSORED!!!

I mean, REALLY?

The commonly expected curse words (as in use by today's high school students) were spoken aloud and both sound tracks were in English.

THE SUBTITLES?  CENSORED!!

In what world does THAT happen?

Anyway, sensitive guy gets heart ripped out.  Goes to work as a bartender with a friend to work through his relationship rehab.  Does a bunch of one night stands and finds love once again.

I'm still watching it as I write this, but the SUBTITLE thing twisted me up so much that I couldn't keep my fingers still.

Enough humor, enough T+A (on the beach and in the bedroom) and a reasonable story line.

Refreshing to see that reality comes crashing down towards the end with some partial realization of how shallow these two guys really are.

At least they both find love before the credits roll.

Go for it!",1460851200,3,955,4.57396449704142

6429687,5,B00KHW4X40,For me this was about 4.75.  I have watched it twice in the last month or so.  I enjoyed the story.  The acting is good and so it the dialog.  Lots of beach and bar scenes.  The visuals were excellent.  Lots of sexiness and sexy activities implied and actual.  Adult viewing only. Some nudity. A lot of toplessness and near nudity.  Some subtle humor caused by mistakes.  Includes cross-dressing by a club owner to get business - convincing.  immorality reigns supreme here.  Watch with care.,1434758400,5,492,4.670588235294118
