8449423,5,B004Z50N9E,"L'amour en douce is one of my favourite French films.  It is one of the first pairings of Daniel Auteill and Emanuelle Beart.  A caution to anyone purchasing this is that it is French language only - no English or other language sub-titles, so unless you are reasonably fluent, don't purchase this!  I remember seeing this film on TV twenty odd years ago, and always regretted not taping it. If you love French films, this one is an absolute must see!",1386201600,2,451,4.54320987654321
