8635654,5,B00HT3NWZ6,"Since one of the principal characters is a bartender, it might be possible to use a cocktail metaphor and describe this film as one part Chinatown, and one part Leap of Faith, well shaken and topped with a splash of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?  Possible, perhaps, but not fitting, since such a description, while it might capture some of the film's influences, would give the impression that this movie was in some way derivative, and derivative it most certainly is not.  Mind you, the screenwriters (director Nesher and Shanaan Streett, the multi-talented front man of the Israeli hip-hop/funk combo HaDag Nachash) definitely had Chinatown on the brain -- one of the principals is a tough P.I. named Yakov Gittis, to give but one example -- and the plot revolves around a miracle-performing rabbi who may or may not be a phony; as the film poster and the preview both reveal, the film also has a fair amount of animation blended in, all drawn by a character who everyone calls ""Arnav"" (""rabbit"" in Hebrew).  Still, this film goes beyond its influences and crafts a clever, funny, very postmodern take on the whodunit and the big questions of faith all filtered through the lens of modern Israeli culture.

Avi Nesher is a superb director, so from a technical and production stand point the film really shines.  Nesher assembled a great cast, and this film spotlights some remarkable up and coming talent in Israeli cinema.  Detective Gittis is played by Adir Miller who's best known for his comedic work on the Israeli TV series Ramzor (""Traffic Light""), but he plays a great tough guy (albeit a wise-cracking one).  Yuval Scharf (best know as Natti's on-again/off-again girlfriend Nitsan in Srugim) is stellar alongside relative newcomer Ori Hizkiah, and a real treat was the brilliant work by Yehuda Levi (Jagger from Eytan Fox's Yossi and Jagger).  Finally, the script is witty and playful, working at several levels and making the film accessible whether or not you're a fan of crime dramas or have much knowledge about Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who figure prominently in the plot.  If you do love noir/detective/gangster movies and know a thing or two about traditional Jewish observance, though, this film will sing to you.",1408838400,4,2223,4.954301075268817
