7633364,2,B01BEQ4AWW,"It's a shame that the person doing the final sound mix felt that the background music should be at least as prominent as what the huge array of experts were saying. Otherwise, an interesting overview.",1456358400,,200,4.742857142857143
7633365,1,B01BEQ4AWW,"Background music gets in the way of the message, which is timely and well-researched. A single narrator would have lent the program more credibility. Big data is serious business, not for easy viewing and listening to various voices, however soothing.",1456358400,,251,5.3
7633366,3,B01BEQ4AWW,"I enjoyed the documentary.
But the background music is annoying and persistent. Like the other reviewer commented -it competes with the speakers.
Too bad. The relentless music just takes away from enjoying the production. There was a short brief moment when it stopped.
I guess the producers wanted to add tension. Failure...",1456358400,4,325,5.269230769230769
7633367,3,B01BEQ4AWW,"Yes this program has been appropriately named as it shows the potentials and the threats of collecting massive amounts of data. Different people can relate to the different potentials and threats depending on the viewers situation.

It is better that this presentation was made for not having a presentation at all.

The presentation of the program however is very annoying. First there is the background music that is a repetitive jingle that competes with the people that are talking. Then there is the soundbite format; instead of one person going to complete thought there are approximately five people each with their little soundbite thoughts on each isolated segment.

We are treated to graphics that are more for entertainment than for understanding of the concepts that are being placed forward. The graphics are also renting quick enough so that you don't see any kind of chart you can relate to.

We are shown people in various environments doing obscure things that have nothing related to the subject are being talked about over the pictures. This is not always the fact as some pictures show people using devices that take their pulse and whatnot; however this is not explained in the presentation and can only be derived from people who onlys devices.

That being said there are some good points when they speculate on privacy versus utility and data collection.

Im about to purchase the book to see what was not placed in the video presentation due to time and space considerations. Hopefully it will be a better presentation without a lot of soundbites.",1456272000,3,1571,4.977099236641221
7633368,4,B01BEQ4AWW,very informational and interesting. It li definitely worth watching,1465257600,,67,6.555555555555555
7633369,5,B01BEQ4AWW,"Great documentary, I bought several for clients. They were shipped quickly",1463875200,,74,5.818181818181818
7633370,4,B01BEQ4AWW,Excellent documental to see how IoT will change our everyday lives.,1461283200,,67,5.181818181818182
7633371,1,B01BEQ4AWW,We downloaded this movie and started to listen. BUT we found that the background music and/or effects were louder than the dialog. So much so we could not understand the dialog at all. For some reason the preview of this movie did not have the same problem. This was very disappointing ! We would like a refund.,1459555200,,311,4.473684210526316
7633372,5,B01BEQ4AWW,"Very informative
Whether you want it or not big data is here to stay",1459209600,,68,3.9285714285714284
7633373,2,B01BEQ4AWW,Such an important subject. I hope the subject is  soon revisited by someone who understands how to make a documentary.,1458432000,,118,4.9
7633374,3,B01BEQ4AWW,"I enjoyed the program which I saw on PBS and it certainly gave some food for thought about the subject, but I was astounded that the other reviewers AGREED with me that the music was frustrating and pervasive.  I actually came her JUST to complain about it thinking that nobody else would notice because I am usually picky about stuff like that.

The music throughout gave the video a sense of urgency that made me feel like they were always about to sum it all up and that I'd see the credits, but it just went on and on jumping from sound bite to sound bite.  Also, as someone else said, nobody seemed to ever complete a thought.",1457136000,,631,4.330508474576271

7633376,3,B01BEQ4AWW,"Yesterday I sent out a missive to my friends list on ""The Human Face of Big Data,"" and expressed a reservation. I qualified that because I hadn't seen the entire movie. Now I have.

Here's a good example of what I'm talking about; a big effin deal conference in Frisco: [...]

Here're the prices: [...]

That's right: One DAY is $900.00

A wise friend once said to me, ""Notice how there are any number of sociological and psychological studies on the dispossessed or working classes, but try looking for one on the political assumptions of the elites.""

To state the obvious, economics is an important factor in understanding our world. But just as Big Data is helping reveal the hidden aspects of our world, the elephant in the room -- at least to me -- is, who's doing the collecting and analysis? Who's dictating, proclaiming or just plain doing  methodology, pedagogy and analysis? What about a big data study on big data, like who has access? Like readers on the pages of newspapers and blogs -- particularly acute and astute are readers on sports blogs -- how subject to scrutiny are these ""thought leaders"" from the genesis of their projects, particularly when taxpayer money is being used?

Years ago I had an interest in the digital divide, the gap between the IT haves and have nots. In The Human Face of Big Data,"" the point is made that because of cell phone technology, this gap is closing.

But what was so clear to me in watching this was the patronizing, the digital infantilising of third worlders who while they had access, were now food for the machine -- a machine that was scraping their exhausts in order to find ... something... for these knowledge detectives.

I'm not questioning the intent of these folks, but a kinder and perhaps more robust way of saying who died and made you Big Data King or Queen for a day?, is: can Third Worlders scrape the elites' data and ""look for stuff?""

Money greases the wheels of innovation and entrepreneurship -- that I'm all for on a fair playing field. But again stating the obvious, money can freeze out too. If it's true that ""knowledge is power,"" then I'm reminded of Calculated Risk's late, and very talented, Tanta Dungey's rejoinder: That's why they never give you any.",1456876800,2,2237,4.669211195928753
7633377,4,B01BEQ4AWW,"Really well put together, although maybe a little too optimistic.

Who ever was in charge of audio levels needs to redo their work. The voice-overs were often hard to hear, and the narrator level seemed quieter than the rest of the interviewees. Turning on closed-captioning seemed to help.",1456444800,,290,5.041666666666667
8749982,5,B01BEQ4AWW,"One of the most informative, fascinating and hopeful videos I have ever watched!",1533427200,,80,5.230769230769231
8749983,3,B01BEQ4AWW,Various experts are talking. Examples of BIG DATA are splashed on the screen. I was unable to make sense of this video.,1489622400,,119,4.454545454545454
8749984,2,B01BEQ4AWW,"It felt like a bunch of self help lines connected by data driven thoughts and cute, motivational, cute music,",1489363200,,109,4.7894736842105265
8749985,5,B01BEQ4AWW,"An outstanding expose of the possibilities...both Utopian and terrifying, of the enormous volume of data collected everyday (actually, every minute!) and how this data can be used to benefit or destroy mankind!  From predicting epidemics to surveillance of ordinary citizens to formulations of marketing strategies, this is a video that every owner of a cell phone, account holder with Facebook and Twitter, and all of the other social media websites should view.  The debt of gratitude that Americans owe Mr. Edward Snowden is incalculable!",1480982400,2,541,5.428571428571429
8749986,5,B01BEQ4AWW,Would love to see a series on big data by industry. This is huge!,1476403200,,65,3.7142857142857144

8749989,4,B01BEQ4AWW,"Thought provoking, but doesn't really offer any solutions.  Depending on what your thoughts are regarding privacy, the information presented here may excite you about the possibilities of the future, or make you reconsider your use of the internet.",1470700800,,248,5.526315789473684

8749991,5,B01BEQ4AWW,Absolutely mind blowing. Those people who are concentrating on the music when the information being presented is so absolutely fascinating confounds me. I honestly didn't even notice the music until reading these reviews.,1465516800,,221,5.7272727272727275
