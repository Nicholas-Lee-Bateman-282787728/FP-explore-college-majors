""Codename: Kids Next Door"" are back in action in their second DVD jam-packed with seven new-to-DVD episodes such as:

""Operation: CAMP"" - While the KND investigates a summer camp, Numbuh Two and Numbuh Three take care of a baby skunk.

""Operation: SHAVE"" - Things get a little hairy when crazed mustaches start attaching to people - including the operatives !

""Operation: TRIP"" - Numbuh Three takes a trip to Japan not knowing that she's being followed by The Interesting Twins from Beneath the Mountain.

""Operation: TRAINING"" - Numbuh Two's brother Tommy and a couple of cadets do some training at the KND Arctic Base.  However, their training gets cut short when Father infiltrates the base.

Special features of this DVD include secret codes for ""Kids Next Door - Operation: VIDEOGAME"" for your XBOX, PS2, or Gamecube system.  Also, there's a bonus episode of ""Grim and Evil"" on here.  That would be the episode where Mandy falls in love(?!).

If fighting adult tyranny totally floats your boat, this is the show for you.  Keep watching Cartoon Network for more as well as Cartoon Network Video online for more adventures to see.",1261785600,6,1197,4.847290640394089

2295967,5,B0009K7QYY,This show reminds me of when I was a kid play in the backyard.  As kids we wish we had adventures like this.  The show displays to kids how far their imagination can take them.,1250380800,,176,4.0
2295968,1,B0009K7QYY,"ok, KND sucks. Why do they keep on making this crap?! the only show that is actually good on CN is Grim and Evil. But i don't watch it because there is commercials every second on grim and evil. Plus crap like this on cartoon network, make the disney channel look good. So don't buy this. Its so stupid with all of the stupid storylines, scripts, drawings, action, and missions.

Cartoon Network, please take of KND and stop putting commercials every second while you're at it!",1123545600,,477,4.546511627906977
2295969,5,B0009K7QYY,"It's great that there's a new KND DVD, but why aren't they coming out with a DVD collection of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, the best show on Cartoon Network?

  They came out with a KND DVD, then an Ed, Edd and Eddy, so why not Foster's next instead of a second KND?

  I love the show, but CN should try and get all of their hit shows on DVD before they make two of one show.",1118188800,3,384,3.9220779220779223
8062215,5,B0009K7QYY,"I Just saw the teaser trailer for G.KND that stands for Galactic Kids Next Door Series on Youtube and guess what ? there no plans for a Galactic Kids Next Door Series this series needs to brought to life this series needs to happen Cartoon Network needs to make this happen because Codename Kids Next Door was a great series and a lot of fun which is why I recommend that you get your hands on the Codename Kids Next Door Vol's 1/2 Dvd""s this series is the reason why we have the kid in us. Cartoon Network do us a big favor and green light Galactic Kids Next Series make this series happen rise to the occasion. In my amazon.ca review I gave both Codename Kids Next Door Volumes 1/2 Dvd' a 5.5 rating it stays the same rating for Codename Kids Next Door Volumes 1/2 Dvd's this series deserves a high rating because (Unlike a current series from dc comics a certain series that will be in theaters on 07.27.18) that series is not really the best series on Cartoon Network so again Cartoon Network make this series happen. Final rating for Codename Kids Next Door Vol 1/2 Dvd's is  5.5 stars Get Your Copys Today",1518480000,,1111,4.341346153846154
