I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in climbing or for anyone that enjoys stories of inspiration and encouragement.  Not only does it have some GREAT climbing and boldering footage, but it also shows how overcoming obstacles in climbing is a lot like overcoming obstacles in everyday life.  Each of the 5 women in the film talk about how climbing has changed their outlook on life and how it has helped them deal with all kinds of challenges. By the end of the video, you really feel like you've gotten to know each of them.  It's got quality video footage mixed with beautiful black and white still images and an amazing soundtrack.  Do yourself a favor and get this one!!",1010361600,4,794,4.676258992805756
