8504877,5,B003M9880U,"I purchased both the DVD and book after seeing Dr. Kaiser Sterns present on public television.  The DVD is a gift but I kept the book for myself.  Often books on serious subjects can be a ""dry read,"" and only readable in short segments.  However, I read for nearly an hour, putting the book down only to slow the progress.  The author's personal experience seems to render her that much more powerful and compassionate, beyond her extensive formal experience and training.  This book will provide me with needed insights when caring for those in my world who are hurting and grieving from loss.",1315699200,5,594,4.728155339805825
