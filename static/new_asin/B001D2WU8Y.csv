3522997,4,B001D2WU8Y,"KNIGHT RIDER was a cool show about an ex-police officer that nearly gets killed in the line-of-duty who is now a recluse freelance crime-fighting investigator with a new face and a new identity and given a supercar with spectacular capabilities beyond imaginination that could talk and was virtually indestructable that was given to Michael by a dying eccentric millionaire Wilton Knight(Richard Basehart)to combat criminals who operated above the law that even the police couldn't touch, at least not without loner Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff) and KITT's help, yet no criminal was ever too scary or violent nor even killed by Michael or KITT on this show either.

Therefore, Michael and KITT specialized in impossible situations where most other people wouldn't dare along with the fact that Michael and KITT were like a James Bondish type duo of heros, except KITT was also a talking car with a cynical, but concerned and sweet personality with a slight sense of humor unlike any car James Bond ever drove.

Something else I noticed about this show was if you take a real close hard look at each episode throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC, you'll notice that KITT's 1st Season obviously used more Trans Am stunt cars for KITT look alike cars in about half the scenes per episode, because if you look very closely in the pilot episode, the ""Good Day At White Rock"" episode, the ""Slammin Sammys"" episode, the ""Not A Drop To Drink"" episode, the ""Inside Out"" episode, the ""Forget Me Not"" episode, the ""A Plush Ride"" episode, the ""Chariot Of Gold"" episode, etc., you'll notice that in a lot of scenes when Michael & KITT are about to do a stunt or drives in a far distance or on rugged terrain that KITT had a regular round steering wheel instead of the fancy pilot type steering wheel with the fancy dashboard since the producers of KNIGHT RIDER actually used a total of 4 Trans Ams to do the show, not just one Trans Am, in order to avoid too many costly repairs on the main KITT with the fancy dashboard & steering wheel.

As a matter of fact, KITT was not only a snazzy '82 Pontiac Trans Am with souped up features and accessories, the Trans Ams they used for the Knight 2000 were also the first '82 Trans Ams sold off the assembly lot by General Motors, according to creator(Glen Larson).

In other words General Motors had specifically sold the first four '82 Trans Ams to Universal before General Motors even started selling '82 Trans Ams to the public.

In addition to that David Hasselhoff even stated in a TV Guide article back in the Summer of 1983 that in real life behind the scenes whenever they'd do a stunt on the show that sometimes the KITT look alike stunt cars would actually break in half and they'd have to repair them and/or replace them by replacing the outershell with a newer outer shell underneath whenever any of the Trans Ams got banged up kind of like when you peel the skin off an onion, which was very similar to how the producers ran THE DUKES OF HAZZARD since they'd use numerous stunt cars for the General Lee, especially in the stunt scenes which often racked up and/or broke the General Lee stunt cars as well, & just like the producers of STREET HAWK would do by using at least 14 different motorcycles with stuntmen to do the stunts on STREET HAWK as well.

As a matter of fact this show takes me all the way back to memory lane to when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD started getting a big decline in ratings when KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC back in September of 1982 since the Dukes were starting to lose a lot of viewers through KNIGHT RIDER, due to the fact that the Knight 2000 had outclassed the General Lee along with the fact that Bo Duke(John Schneider) & Luke Duke(Tom Wopat)had been replaced by the new Dukes Coy Duke(Byron Cherry) & Vance Duke(Christopher Mayer) in the Autumn of 1982 along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER & THE DUKES OF HAZZARD were both shown on the same night since THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was shown on CBS at 8PM and KNIGHT RIDER was shown on NBC at 9PM during KNIGHT RIDER's First Season and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD'S Fifth Season, which made it quite inconvenient for the Dukes since KNIGHT RIDER had K.O.'d THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in the ratings leaving the Dukes with no real chance or way of competing with Michael & KITT, especially in Bo & Luke's absence from THE DUKES OF HAZZARD on top of that, at least until the old Dukes returned to the show in the Spring of 1983 and when NBC had moved KNIGHT RIDER to Sunday nights at 8PM back in August of 1983, which got more people to tune in to watching KNIGHT RIDER more every week since Friday nights are usually family night as opposed to Sundays since most people have to go back to work on Mondays along with the fact that it helped CBS to get more people to start tuning in to watching THE DUKES OF HAZZARD again in the Fall of 1983 and Spring of 1984 since KNIGHT RIDER didn't interfere with the Dukes time slot on Friday nights anymore, even though KNIGHT RIDER still had twice as many viewers than THE DUKES OF HAZZARD did during the Dukes last 3 seasons since KNIGHT RIDER had already stole the Dukes thunder since the Knight 2000 was able to 10 times more than the General Lee could ever do, which nearly killed the Dukes and nearly prompted CBS to cancel THE DUKES OF HAZZARD in 1983.

Therefore THE DUKES OF HAZZARD probably would've ended up cancelling by the Summer of 1984 if NBC hadn't moved KNIGHT RIDER to Sundays instead of keeping KNIGHT RIDER on Fridays, especially if NBC would've just moved KNIGHT RIDER to the 8PM time slot on Friday nights instead of the 8PM time slot on Sunday nights since it would've interferred and conflicted with THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's 8PM time slot on CBS every Friday night, especially since THE DUKES OF HAZZARD would've ended up losing even more Duke fans through KNIGHT RIDER if NBC had shown KNIGHT RIDER at 8PM on Friday nights since that was the same time slot THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was shown on CBS at the time.

The truth is this KNIGHT RIDER-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD may seem highly unnecessary, but it's really worth it even if you already have the whole collection of all 4 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER on DVD like I do that were all released season by season one at a time between the Summer of 2004 and the Spring of 2006 which contain every single episode throughout it's whole 1982-86 run on NBC since this DVD box set doesn't have all the flaws from the double sided disc that the individual season box sets had, which is probably why Universal doesn't make their DVD box sets with 2-sided disk anymore and perhaps why they haven't made double-sided DVD discs in nearly 3 years either.

Therefore Universal is probably trying to compensate and make up for messing up on some of the DVD's on all 4 Seasons of the individual KNIGHT RIDER DVD box sets that were released between the Summer of 2004 and the Spring of 2006, since they all had double sided discs in each individual season box set, but had some skipping and freezing up in some episodes, especially in the episodes ""Knightmares"", ""Knight Song"", ""White-Line Warriors"", ""Ring Of Fire"", ""Deadly Knightshade"", etc., which is what prompted me to get this KNIGHT RIDER Complete Series DVD box set so I can watch all those episodes without any freezing or skipping since its so exasperating trying to watch the episodes ""Knightmares"", ""White-Line Warriors"", and ""Deadly Knightshade"" stalling and skipping over everytime like they did on the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD box set that was released in April of 2005 and on the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4 in April of 2006, despite the fact that times are tight right now, but getting this KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD was so worth it since all the episodes were redone very well on single-sided discs instead of on a dual-sided disc.

In addition to that; this KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD box set even provides a brief summary posting their original air dates exactly like they did on the individual season box sets of KNIGHT RIDER from Knight Rider's Season 1 thru Season 3, since the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4 DVD box set didn't show a brief summary posting their original air-dates on them, unlike the first 3 season box sets did.

Overall, this KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD takes me all the way back to memory lane when I used to watch this show religiously every weekend on NBC every Friday during its 1st Season and then every Sunday night during its 2nd and 3rd Seasons, since this DVD contains every single episode complete & uncut exactly like they were shown throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC as opposed to how they were shown in reruns in syndication and on cable TV since USA, WGN, the Sci-Fi Channel, and TV Land deleted too many scenes and added too many commercials in between, since cable networks and local TV stations unfortunately cut parts out of each episode on every TV show in order to allot for more commercial time.

Therefore I was able to watch each episode without any freezing up or skipping and I was able to watch the episodes from the 3rd Season that had some sound effects taken out on the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3 DVD box set that Universal released in January of 2006 like the ""Knight Of The Chameleon"" episode did for instance, but I was able to hear all the sound effects on this DVD that were missing on the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3 DVD and I was able to watch the episodes ""Knightmares"", ""White-Line Warriors"", ""Deadly Knightshade"", and ""Knight Song"" without any freezing or skipping since I was never able to watch those episodes most of the time on the individual season DVD box sets, which was probably due to the fact that all 4 of the individual season box sets had double sided discs, but with this KNIGHT RIDER-THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set I don't have to worry about that anymore since each DVD case now has 2 seperate disk in each DVD case instead of 1 double sided disc per case that Universal with all 4 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER that they sold and released individually.

Therefore, this KNIGHT RIDER: Complete Series DVD box set shows us every episode that takes us all the way back to memory lane to when this show became an instant smash wiping everything out in the ratings when it ranked at number 3 in the Nielsen ratings when it made its debut on NBC on Sunday September 26, 1982 all the way to when this show tanked in the Summer of 1986 after its 4-year run, due to a severe decline in ratings.

In addition to that, this DVD box set also takes us back to memory lane to when STREET HAWK stole KNIGHT RIDERs thunder back in the Winter of 1985 nearly killing this show when STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC on Friday January 4, 1985 when Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)and STREET HAWK had stole ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael & KITT nearly leading to this shows cancellation since STREET HAWK had K.O.'d KNIGHT RIDER in the ratings until STREET HAWK was cancelled in the Spring of 1985 after its brief 3 1/2-month run on ABC.

Something else I found quite intriguing about KNIGHT RIDER was the fact that even though I now realize that KITT couldn't really talk that the voice of the car was William Daniels, which played the pompous hard-nosed(Dr. Mark Craig)on ST. ELSEWHERE and the lonely Mr. Feeney on BOY MEETS WORLD just like body-builder(Lou Ferrigno)played the Hulk on THE INCREDIBLE HULK, which both just so happened to be Universal distributions that were both filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood, which make both William Daniels and Lou Ferrigno intriguing memorable icons to me for memory lane when KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC and when THE INCREDIBLE HULK was on CBS.

This show also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when TV was a lot cleaner and a lot simpler before sex, excessive violence, and profanity took over television on every other TV show and cartoon, but fortunately KNIGHT RIDER had no sex or nudity or cussing in it throughout its whole 1982-1986 run on NBC.

This DVD box set also takes me all the way back to memory lane to my childhood days since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) at the time throughout Knight Rider's whole 4-year run on NBC along with the fact that I used to sometimes watch this show twice on the same night every Sunday since I used to watch it between 6PM & 7PM on KYEL, which was the NBC affiliate for Yuma, AZ and then I'd watch Knight Rider again at 8PM on KNBC, which is the NBC affiliate for Los Angeles, which I used to do frequently since the whole Imperial Valley is such a small remote community with nothing to really do for fun or social activity.

So now that Universal has made a complete series DVD of KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, and THE INCREDIBLE HULK; I'm curious to see if Universal makes a MAGNUM, P.I.-The Complete Series DVD, THE ROCKFORD FILES-The Complete Series DVD, and AIRWOLF-The Complete Series DVD, since MAGNUM, THE ROCKFORD FILES, & AIRWOLF were also 2 popular TV classics by Universal as well just like KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, & THE INCREDIBLE HULK all were.

By the way, I just got word that the Shout Factory will be releasing the short-lived supercycle drama STREET HAWK with Rex Smith out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 which shall give us something else to look forward to.",1232496000,6,13269,4.562972292191436

The only thing missing is the Knight Rider 2000 reunion movie, which premiered in 1991. I had contacted Universal pictures and they told me that the rights were held by CIC video. Apparently, there is some kind of legal dispute over who owns the rights. And it may take years to resolve this issue. Who knows if it will ever be released? In the meantime, I was able to find the Knight Rider 2000 movie on ebay.",1230940800,4,569,4.327102803738318

3523001,4,B001D2WU8Y,"I realize a lot of people out there don't like Knight Rider, but this review isn't for them! (They shouldn't even be looking at this product description if they're not interested in the show.) Apparently enough people DO like the show, since there's a new Knight Rider series airing on NBC and the release of this new boxed set.

The box is awesome...at least until the shrinkwrap is removed (reason why in a moment). This is by far one of the coolest box designs for a DVD set. Press a button at the lower-right, and a red LED scanner effect turns on with a few (very short) seconds of the show's theme music. I do think Universal should have spent a few pennies more to lengthen the audio sample. It would also have been ""neater"" if the effect was triggered by opening the box rather than by a push-button switch, even if it means giving up the demo ""Try Me"" feature for people who haven't purchased it yet.

The bad news about the packaging is a cardstock sheet on the back which is NOT affixed to the box. (Normally this kind of artwork is attached with glue dots, but not this time.) There are printed instructions for changing the LED batteries on the back of this card, and it's too big to fit inside the box after opening. So...what to do with it?? Battery instructions (and possibly a disc index) should have been printed on a card attached to the inside of the box, and the outer cardstock should have been attached to the box. Why is this an issue? Well, I for one consider packaging to be part of the product, not simply a ""container"" for the discs.

The discs themselves are in slim DVD cases, two discs per case, and they're single-sided encodings! Finally, fans can watch Knight Rider episodes on DVD without the technical flaws and stalls inherent with double-sided discs. There are also lots of bonus features not included with the original releases. Notably missing from the bonus features, however, are bloopers, gag reels, and NBC promotional spots. Since the size and price of this item clearly suggests it being targeted at fans, material that fans would be interested in (such as outtakes, interviews, KITT guest spots and cameos, etc.) would have been a nice addition, even at a slightly higher price.

If you're a fan of the show and haven't bought the individual season DVDs yet, get this set instead. If you've already bought the individual seasons (as I had), get this set anyway to replace the inferior double-sided discs. Even with this set's shortcomings, it's still nicely done.",1225065600,50,2510,4.646396396396397
3523002,5,B001D2WU8Y,This was one of the best shows of the 80's if not the best and while I have all four on DVD I am going to get this set because it is what it is.  The show was about a man and his talking car K.I.T.T.  While talking cars are getting closer to reality with GPS and things their will  never be another show like this.  I want to take a minute and say that the New Knight Rider is AWSOME and people just need to give it a chance it will hit it's stride.  You know this isn't the only set coming out in a big set on the 21st of October.  The Incredible Hulk is coming out the exact same way.  So next week let's all reve up and help Knight Rider.,1223856000,9,641,3.7388059701492535

By no means is this a deal-breaker, because the as-broadcast episodes with their original soundtracks literally cannot be purchased today, unless you're a VHS fan.

The video quality in general is quite good, though obviously not on par with a modern 1080p release. Bright scenes (which are the majority) have very good detail and color, but I found that very dark scenes seem to have had some sore of artificial ""film grain"" filter applied to them. The discs' authors evidently thought that this would maintain the illusion of the series as having been in Full-HD all along; to me, it just looks like a cheap digital attempt at enhancement and I would rather that they had left the old analog blurriness in.

Overall, I'm glad that I bought the set. The soundtrack is not what I remember from childhood, but the video quality more than makes up for that.

Please be advised that there are no extras at all, no additional audible language tracks, and not even any subtitles. This is a completely bare-bones Blu-Ray set. So if you are hearing-impaired, or if English is not a language with which you are comfortable, you will not enjoy this set.",1494288000,6,1508,4.8599221789883265
3523212,3,B001D2WU8Y,I purchased this because I like watching Knight Rider.  My husband loves it more than I do so I bought for him thinking we can both watch it together.  I'm am deaf and relied on closed captioning.  That's why I only gave 3 stars because of no captioning.  I was very disappointed,1494028800,,279,4.3076923076923075

I was quite excited to learn of this series being released, but I had no prior knowledge of it having been released before on DVD, on that note, if you are purchasing this set just for the series in general, it's a great buy, if you are looking for any ""Special Features""; I.E. ""Commentary from Creator/Actor(s), Blueprints of K.I.T.T."", you will be sorely disappointed. Also, please be aware that it is the ""Matte Box"" & not the ""glossy black box with a red light which goes back & forth & a little bit of the Knight Rider theme plays when you press the button"" (there is no red light that goes back & forth & no Knight Rider theme). Packaging is a ""Sore Point"" as well, it is a 16-Disc DVD Box set, all 16 Discs are placed in Cardboard DVD sleeves, 2 Discs to a sleeve (I've never been a ""fan"" of this type of packaging as I feel the Discs themselves ""Might/Could become scratched over time""), so if you want to protect your investment, invest in a ""Multi-Disc DVD Case, or purchase an 8 Disc DVD case (2 cases would be needed, 8 Discs to a case, 2 seasons per case).

3523321,1,B001D2WU8Y,"MILL CREEK have gained the rights to KNIGHT RIDER TV SERIES
and released all 4 seasons on blu-ray now
but Mill creek's effort with the HD transfers look similar to Universal's Digital remaster transfers to me
meaning Mill creek only slightly upgraded each episodes picture quality to 1080p they didn't do a full 1080p HD transfer
with every episode so the quality drops in & out pretty pathetic Mill creek is only a small Distributor what do you expect
the sound quality is only slightly boosted aswell
EXTRAS none of the extras from the Universal dvd set have been carried over, no surprise there
PACKAGING for each season has their own standard blu-ray case with 4 Discs in each case, 2 on each side of the case
why the Discs were not on Flip trays, my guess is Mill creek were being Lazy just like they did with the HD transfers
Amazon are selling this for $47.50 not worth the money in my opinion only worth $30 or less
U.K. company Fabulous films has also reissued Knight rider tv series on blu-ray all 4 seasons
each season has 5 Discs on Disc trays in their own clamshell case
the 1:33:1 HD transfers for each episode are very Good quality much better then Mill creek's effort no Doubt about it
the sound quality has been boosted up 2.0 master stereo mix which does sound better sounding than the
old Dolby digital sound
and guess what all the extras from the old Universal dvd set have been carried over
so ofcourse Fabulous films made more effort with the packaging than what Mill creek did for their blu-ray set
the only negative thing is the U.K blu-ray set is region B locked not ABC coded tragically
1 star for the Mill creek blu-ray set, 4-5 stars for the U.K. Fabulous films blu-ray based on much better packaging
and much better picture quality
so probably worth more cash buying the U.K. blu-ray set",1482883200,4,1816,4.522796352583587

The series pays tribute to the theme of ""One man can make a difference"", however with tools never seen before in a super car.

3523390,4,B001D2WU8Y,Quality control is a bit lacking at Mill Creek.  They are usually fairly good as far as the media is concerned.  First set arrived with foggy something on the playing side and Disc 4 of Season 1 was cracked.  Replacement also had this weird foggy film on the playing side that wipes off if your trying to check if something is a scratch or not.  Reviews for the video etc off blu ray * c  ---  believe it's rather good but it is indeed missing the fun and sadly only add on to the series Knight Rider 2000.  If your a fanatic I'd keep your old sets mostly for the extra's.  The DVD's themselves were a nightmare and I almost lost interest in the series altogether for it.  Universal refused to exchanged them for the DVD-9 set they ended up coming out with later.  Other companies actually offered to replace them with dvd-9's  (Lonesome Dove)  but not Universal.  the DVD-18 were plagued with mastering problems that I don't even think were a dvd-18 problem.  And the only way you could find out if they were defective was to actually watch each disc :(  I got tired of exchanging them by the beginning of the third season :(  So I've never had such an issue with any blu ray.  Hopefully these don't have mastering defects.  (ie defects that occured before the dvd's were even pressed or recorded etc.  ),1481414400,4,1305,4.407563025210084

I don't mind a light layer of grain but these have way too much and makes the picture look muddy. I wanna commend Mill Creek for releasing this on blu ray but I just can't do it.

3523444,1,B001D2WU8Y,"First off, I own the original Universal DVD sets that contain 6 dics per season. I now also own the Mill Creek Blu-Ray Set that contains 4 discs per season. I have watched every episode of this show at least 10 times. Anyways, I want to let all you fellow Knight Rider fans know what a SCAM Mill Creek is trying to pull off with this release! The most important thing people want to know is what is the picture quality like compared to the previous DVDs? I put in Goliath first and what I saw was hard to believe! The colors were dull, flat and washed out!!!! HORRIBLE! I noticed black scratches on the screen as well that had not been cleaned up. I stuck in my DVD of the SAME episode and the color was AMAZING and VIBRANT compared to the Horrible Mill Creek Blu-Ray!! The same black scratches were still on the DVD, which means no clean up was done on the new transfers. As far as detail goes, there is NO DIFFERENCE! Well I take that back, the DVD has MORE DETAIL. Because the Mill Creek Blu-Rays look so washed out, they loose detail. The Universal DVDs have a natural color and warmth to them...As to the sound, AGAIN The DVD defeats the Poor Mill Creek versions hands down! I tried them at the same volume control and had to turn up the Mill Creek blu-ray to achieve the same loudness as the DVD. Whats more, the sound was clearer on the DVDs and more Muffed on the Blu-Rays...

Other things to note is that the Knight Rider 2000 Movie is missing from the Blu-Ray set as well, and in some cases they use the syndicated versions instead of the original broadcasts!!! NO EXCUSE for this!! I checked Knight of Drones and it is indeed the syndicated cut version!

And of course, as many have said the stacked discs are also a big thumbs down..

I could have gotten over the missing Knight Rider 2000 and the stacked discs, if these were truly HD Remasters. (They are not-trust me-they look like a bootleg!) Knight Rider fans BEWARE, you are getting a cheap sub-par product. The most important thing is picture and sound and this Mill Creek Set falls on its face so bad with its washed out colors and muffed sound... This is a quick cash grab from Mill Creek! If you want to see Knight Rider look the best on your HDTV, go buy the Universal 6 Disc DVD Sets!!!

You know the old saying, you get what you pay for. The set is going for around 45 bucks and it is not even worth that. I paid 40 for my 4 seasons of the Universal releases and thats what everyone else should do. AVOID this Sad Mill Creek release at all costs!!!",1476835200,18,2523,4.2719665271966525

All that's on this new blu ray set is the maps blowing off KITT's roof as he leaves to go help Michael.

I bought my set NEW recently at a local video/music store. The normal price was $99, but was on sale for $70.  I do not know where Amazon sellers get this $169 price from.  Even though it is a great set. I would not pay that much for it.",1438905600,,561,4.175925925925926

I keep checking to see if any of them have added a whole season for free and they never do, hence I keep looking at this box set!

1. Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death - Missing Song (Hurts So Good)
  - Why did the loose the rights to a song that is a
  cover version of the original anyway?
2. Season 2 has some very scratchy sounds problems on some episodes
  when the universal logo comes in, the early Season 2 on the double
  layers did not have that problem

After all that is all what gets me here. This is a great gift for KR Fans and good as well, that it is single sided. But beware, do not give away the first season releses, since a song is missing and the quality is way better :)",1366848000,,707,3.9857142857142858

One down side of this is that some of the dics do not play well with side a or b and you can not watch the shows, to me if i had the chance
i would have paid for them seperate but this caught my eye and i like the idea of all of them together.
Other than that if you really like this show go for it because i am not sure if they are still going seperate or not
The packaging was great and slim cases a plus and also the sound was great from the show and also from the box its self wow

I was VERY disappointed then,to discover that every disc in the box was in NTSC region 1 format,which won't play in machines in the UK. To play these DVDs in my machine,they would need to be PAL region 2. Although Amazon have refunded me the total cost,they have yet to tell me if this set is available correctly formatted for UK DVD players. I have just checked the order page for this item,and it still says `Format:DVDs`. As my order was clearly labelled for delivery to a UK address,this was a very silly mistake for Amazon to make - the order page should clearly state which format the DVDs are.

3523716,4,B001D2WU8Y,"I never would have paid MSRP on this item, but I wanted it (for nostalgic reasons) and found it ""Used"", yet unopened/still factory sealed, from a private seller for just under $50.

The packaging is very impressive looking, but quite impractical. Obviously it can't be stored with other DVDs due to the shape of the box. However, the 12 slim DVD cases inside will fit in a normal DVD rack. The light on the box takes standard ""AA"" batteries.

I'm pretty sure the DVDs are just the 4 individual seasons bundled together for the Complete Series Boxed Set. The ""Special Features"" are ""just okay"" and a bit awkward to navigate. Each season has it's own special features, which are all on one disk, but the menus are on EACH disk with the ""link"" shaded out, and a footnote saying ""Special Features on Disk 6"". The Knight Rider 2000 TV movie sequel is oddly located on a Season ONE disk. And there is a random BONUS episode from Season FOUR on a Season THREE disk (then the episode is repeated on a Season FOUR disk).

And now, a brief and highly opinionated synopsis of Knight Rider, season by season:

Season ONE: Stories were a bit dry, but believable. KITT was a piece of junk! His hood and fenders looked like they were going to shake off during every stunt scene. All his interior computer gadgets were very cheap looking. Bonnie was a real b****! This season was like an urban Dukes of Hazzard.

Season TWO: Some minor improvements to KITT's interior, as well as his abilities. Where did Bonnie go? And who is this April bimbo? The stories were about par with season ONE.

Season THREE: (The memorable season)! The show must have had a budget increase. KITT's interior was revamped to look much more expensive. The stories were quite a bit more entertaining. Stunts were more impressive. And Bonnie came back! If you were to only buy one season, this would be the one to get.

Season FOUR: RC3 was a delightful addition to the cast. Unfortunately Knight Rider jumped the shark with ""Super Pursuit Mode""! KITT's transformation into ""SPM"" was overused and ""featured"" in nearly every episode of the season. The stories got stupid and hokey as the writers really started pushing sci/fi on an action/adventure show. Several episodes from this season were pure torture to watch.",1314403200,2,2273,4.6959798994974875

For less than 50 bucks I was able to get the whole Complete Series. When my brother found just one episode for $40. I know he was looking for all the seasons but struggle to find one or two seasons. And it came in a nice box with all these special features including KITT's red light with the Knight Rider music not to mention the Knight Rider movie as well.

It is a glossy blackbox with a red light which goes back & forth & a little bit of the Knight Rider theme plays when you press the button.
The box opens to reveal all 24 discs for the entire 84 episodes during four year run of the series. Be advised that this set does not contain those dreaded double-sided discs that were used during the initial release of the series on dvd! A definite plus!
Episode highlights that should not be missed are which happen to be my personal favourites of the ""top of my head""::
The pilot known as Knight of the Phoenix,
Trust doesn't rust( the first appearance of K.A.R.R.),
Goliath (Garth Knight returns from the dead!),
Knight of the Drones,
Goliath Returns,
K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.,
Junk Yard Dog,
Knight of the Juggernaut,
& of course, Knight Rider 2000!
There also the episodes of the Hoffs' former fiance & wife, Catherine Hickland.
For those of you who got it at the deal I did, can thank the timing of when it was put on sale! Right now it is a bit pricey, let's hope that those of you who have not purchased it as yet, maybe patient enough for the price to drop to the alltime low price once more this year!

3523736,5,B001D2WU8Y,"Having appreciated this series since forever, I was most pleased to acquire this comprehensive video codex for timelessly stimulating entertainment at one's leisure.

Cruising in recently to The Haunted Noctuary is the Complete Knight Rider collection, which could also be veritably named The Ultimate Collection, and The Knight Rider Codex, for it is just perfection; and here is why:

Every episode is preserved in this impressive attach&eacute; case-like sleek, glossy black box* shaped ever so slightly like the front end of KITT's front fender, complete with scanner, activated by pressing a button, which is accompanied by the theme. An overall futuristic impression. Already a gratifying experience which just gets better and better.

The DVD's & cases themselves are presented in slim, elegant black splendor, whereupon engaging the main menu, snippets of the series play along with the characteristic scanner moving with ones selection. Full descriptions on back in digital font, framed by a computer chip like border. The episodes are crisp and clear, with great sound quality,

Special features include interviews with cast and crew (The Hoff, series creator Glen A. Larson (who go at each other in an amusing repartee}, composer Don Peake, & stunt coordinator Andy Gill); an ""owners manual"" (""Autonomicon"", detailing the various functions on KITT's interactive dashboard}; stills gallery, blueprints (of KITT, several sets, and The Knight Foundation Mansion, or the ""Hassel Castle"", for those so inclined; actually ""Greystone""); and the forgettable film 'Knight Rider 2000' (which proves to be the ""Addams Family Reunion"" of this series).

So follow the adventures of this secretive vigilante (a veritable modern Black Knight**), and the wonder car KITT into the future of all possibilities.

KNIGHT IS RIGHT!

---------
* The card stock description attached lightly on the back should be removed carefully and preserved separately.
** It is interesting to note many of the parallels between Knight Rider and The Black Knight Batman {which incidentally, was never intended by creator Bob Kane to be so goofy as portrayed by the Adam West variation; but more akin to Tim Burton's portrayal}.",1278979200,11,2202,5.439882697947214
3523737,4,B001D2WU8Y,"There are two sides to my review.

The first is how difficult it was for me to receive a box from Amazon that wasn't dented or scratched up.  In the end I ran into Amazon's limit to how many replacements can be sent to customers and ended up keeping one that I wasn't 100% satisfied with.  It wasn't nearly as bad as the first two I received, though, which is somewhat of a relief.  (It seems that the material the box is made of is easily beat up--that or people at Amazon's warehouse aren't careful.  I'm not sure which it is.)

The second side is what I found inside.  I'm thrilled that everything that was in the individual seasons is also in the box set, including the bonus features and movie (Knight Rider 2000).  But more than anything I'm really happy that these are one sided discs and they come in boxes that keep the discs safe from damage.  I've read too many reviews about other box sets that come in such a way that doesn't protect the discs.  And the point is to enjoy watching them, right?  Not deal with the difficulty of damaged or double sided discs.

I've really enjoyed the button you can push on the front of the box that plays a snippet of the theme song.  I have the box displayed in my hall and every time I walk by--provided that the baby isn't asleep--I can't seem to keep from giving myself a 20 second pick-me-up.

In the end I recommend this box set.  It's slick and complete.",1274140800,4,1407,4.2965779467680605
3523738,2,B001D2WU8Y,"ah,the eighties had some rather hokey programes, knight rider is no exeption. largly due to it's choice of lead actor,i have never seen a man more in love with himself (with the exeption of matthew mcconaughey)than davey ""the hoff"" hasselhoff.(these two actors are  under the elution that they are god""s gift to women) hoff'es hokey persona on knight rider includes, bad acting,an afro hair style (someone give him a haircut),a rodeo belt buckel and michael jackson leather jacket. what the role realy required is someone athletic but instead we get someone who resembles a stick-insect. as far as his acting goes, comes no suprize  from someone who on bay watch has a retarded smile look  on his face when he runs to rescue some unfortunate sod.  the production value the effects still sort of hold up. as for his ""buddy,pal"" kitt (which could be percieved  as an exestention of his manhood"" he still has moments of being just tolerable.",1272758400,3,938,4.8742138364779874

I never thought I would enjoy this collection as much or even more now than when I was a child. Great footage of vintage Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Also the Atari games that Michael plays with K.I.T.T. and the Country/Rock music (new for each episode) bring back memories of a happier time.",1247702400,5,509,4.414893617021277

I had seen some of season 4 with Kitt souped up, with that marvelous Super Pursuit mode, and C button, turning the car into a convertible. Plus the Emergency Braking system. As soon as opened this up, I watched all season one. Then I jumped into Super Pursuit mode Season 4.
