8598796,2,B000PDZRPK,"I contemplated writing anything about this production at all, but there are two things that really must be said to future buyers:

1. Theatre needs to be accessible to everyone and I value those that provide any recorded performances to be made available to the general public as one way of bringing live theatre experiences into our homes. This company should be commended for going through whatever it takes to get this product out there (there are very few live versions of Strindberg plays available on DVD).

2. This is really a poor production in many ways. If you are expecting anything close to a professional production, be warned - this is an amateur production (at best). Acting is one-dimensional and completely cliche more times than not - it is very much like what you might expect to see at a high school production - director choices are sketchy - video effects and continuity are all sub-par. However, I believe everyone involved did the best they could do and they should be commended for that - I don't want to be rude because even at it's worse, the heart of what they are trying to do is admirable. It's just not so great.",1206921600,9,1143,4.625615763546798
