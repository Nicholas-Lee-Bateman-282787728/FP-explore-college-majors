6031144,5,B00FTGYNUS,Although I have not received the dvd yet I saw Pink in concert in Ohio I loved the show I was blown away by her performance she is a must see.,1387756800,,142,3.6129032258064515
6031145,3,B00FTGYNUS,"I am a HUGE Pink fan and saw The Truth About Love Tour in Newark, NJ. I thought this DVD would be an amazing way to capture my memories of the best concert I've ever been to & have them forever. HOWEVER, I will NOT be purchasing this DVD due to the reviews of how bad it has been shot/edited. I REALLY want the Can't Take Me Home medley as my sister thought she was recording it but wasn't :( but it's not worth it if it truly is as bad as everyone is saying. What a bummer :(",1387324800,,476,3.8181818181818183
6031146,3,B00FTGYNUS,"Worth the purchase, but...
I saw Pink twice during this tour, she's absolutely and utterly amazing. The DVD/BD release is atrocious. The hectic editing ruins pretty much EVERY single performance. Even the acoustic ones, where Pink is sitting down, have some fancy directorial trick or pretentious video effect that prevents you from fully enjoying the show.

Pink is so full of energy and the choreographies are so lively and rich that making the viewing experience so hectic and chaotic just prevents you from being engaged and fully enjoying the show as a whole. We're supposed to let HER and her energy enthral us! The split-screen gimmicks and all the frantic bs editing are annoyingly distracting. Cutting to a close-up and then staying on the audience for so long after just 10 frames of a choreography is the most moronic thing to do for live footage. Poland (I'm guessing this frantic style wasn't the editor's idea) sucks the soul out of the show from the very opening number.

Too much audience, to many quick cuts, most of the time you can't even tell what the dancers and Pink are doing, what are the actual steps, because the footage cuts from a front angle to a corner angle and then you see somebody from the audience singing along, and you just can't enjoy the brilliance of the choreography, the fun, the perfect synchronicity and symmetry, anything.

There was no need to have ""Wicked Game"" all in black-and-white. And ""Sober"" is just ruined. What the male dancers did at the end on that cage was genius, but no, we have to see pointless seconds of footage from the top camera showing Pink's head from above, like, what? Three times? We got it the first time, why cut from the magical choreography taking place ON the cage to the static girls inside the cage? The viewers miss a lot, too much, of a terrific routine and what was actually an unforgettable show.

The ""Can't Take Me Home"" medley was such a phenomenal number. The editing RUINS it completely. The dancing makes no sense due to the constant cuts and angle changes.

""The Funhouse Tour"" was filmed brilliantly. I was looking forward to watching this and reliving the experience, but it's just soulless, hectic and it makes the show seem as though it lacks life, when in fact it is one of the most impressive, dynamic and FUN shows you could ever see. What a terrible shame. And shame on anyone (I guess that includes Pink herself as executive producer) who let this crap be released.

I know everyone could already see the whole show by fan-made YouTube clips by the time this was released, and I wish it was some kind of statement to urge people to stop going to concerts in order to record them but rather to enjoy them (you know, like in the good old days when the audience could actually raise both hands and do stuff like... wait for it... clap).

But we do buy DVD's to relive those moments the way they were meant to be experienced, certainly not to watch a series of random angle cuts. And it IS nice to see members of the audience here and there, but my god! Not in the middle of a dance routine. Scratch that. In the middle of a dance step, for crying out loud.

Bottom line: worth the watch, but don't expect too much. Such a pity, really.",1386720000,59,3230,4.566493955094991
6031147,5,B00FTGYNUS,"Haven't received this yet but I know I will love it since I have seen the concert 3 times this year and it was spectacular! I will love watching it on my projection screen! I recommend this to any real P!NK fan, you will love it!",1386720000,,229,4.0
6031148,4,B00FTGYNUS,"What can be said about Pink's ""Truth About Love"" tour? Quite frankly, it's brilliant. It's a combination of gyrating, titillating, and energetic theatrics. The artists (as I'll call her dancers, because they do more than dance) help Pink create a show that is part rock concert, part Cirque du Soleil. This tour ups the ante in using Pink's gymnastics background as many tricks are used in the production. While many singers claim that it is difficult to put on a show and sing completely live and dance full out, Pink proves that it can surely be done. No, she may not have intricate choreography for every upbeat song but the energy that goes into her tissue, bungee, and free fall work uses much more strength.

The recording itself is why I did not rate it a 5/5. As previous reviewers mentioned, the direction isn't that great. It goes from cut to cut and you begin to feel dizzy. Having seen the show live, it is great to be able to see the intricate detail given to the show so I am pleased that this show was filmed. The tour in en par with her Funhouse Tour which was also filmed in Australia.

If you ever have the opportunity to catch a Pink show live, definitely go.",1386460800,14,1178,4.449074074074074
6031149,3,B00FTGYNUS,"I'm going to start by saying that if you are a Pink fan, go ahead and buy this DVD.  As horrible as the editing is, the fun and excitement of her live show still comes through and Pink, her dancers, and her musicians deserve a lot of credit for all their hard work.

That being said, during the first few songs I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish watching the movie.  Cut away after cut away after cut away!  There was never time to fully absorb the greatness of the performance;  some shots were perhaps two seconds before moving on to the next shot.  If I was epileptic I'd worry about a seizure.  I wanted to watch Pink and her dancers and musicians perform, not suffer through the editor's self-indulgence.  I don't need clever camera angles to be entertained, Pink is more than entertaining just standing on stage.

The editor just needed to calm the heck down and let us enjoy the concert.",1386374400,52,895,4.408536585365853
6031150,5,B00FTGYNUS,"Even without having seen it yet, I know it will be another knock your socks off production. She is the ultimate performer. I'm still patiently waiting for Amazon to tell me when I am getting my pre-ordered copy. The day of release they were back ordered and out of stock. Hope to be able to enjoy this by Christmas if not sooner.
Even so, Pink is my all time favorite artist. Since I've not been able to catch her show live here in the states on this or her previous Funhouse tour, the tour dvd is my ticket to this amazing show.
What I would like to know, however is why it was originally supposedly released on December 3rd here in the states and then suddenly was out of stock and backordered, and now it says this item will be released on January 21st. So which is it Amazon? Was it ever actually available on December 3or was the release date always January 21? I will wait another month for it because I am a huge fan, but I wish Amazon had been upfront about the real release date from the beginning. I had hoped to have this item before or by Christmas.",1386374400,2,1061,4.231527093596059
6031151,3,B00FTGYNUS,"The first few tracks are shot with cameras whirling around until you feel dizzy!  When I buy a DVD, I want to see the artist, not up the nostrils of the backup singers or the whirling leg of a dancer.  Once the camera work settled down, the rest of the concert was pure Pink and superb!
When will the people who make DVD's realise that it is not an open invitation for them to do weird angle shots and strange vision.  We want to see the concert as it was!",1386288000,44,456,4.044444444444444
6031152,5,B00FTGYNUS,I have been to several of Pink's concerts and went to this particular one back in March and am going again next week in Philly! She is amazing and no concert can compare.

6031153,5,B00FTGYNUS,I have been waiting for this DVD!  I have been to several of her Concerts and I saw The Truth About Love Tour twice this year!

6031183,4,B00FTGYNUS,"I love Pink, but she is at her best when she just sings. She has the pipes and doesn't need all this production and dance moves. I wouldn't mind if there was some, but this was too much for me. She is so talented that she still comes through with the vocals though. I get why the flashy effects/dancers are deemed necessary, as music today seems more about style than substance. She has both and pulls it off as well as anyone could.",1437177600,,433,4.228915662650603

6031227,5,B00FTGYNUS,"I almost feel silly raving about a rock act at my, uh, advancing age, but... Pink is just an amazing artist in every way. We have watched this video of her Melbourne concert many times and are not tiring of it. Normally, a concert that requires 400 tons of equipment would be something I would shy away from, expecting more gimmicks than quality, but she makes it all work. She never misses a beat, never misses a note. She never lip-synchs, even when doing somersaults 40 feet above the audience.
One of the things that distinguishes Pink from the others is her sense of humor. Her lyrics are brilliant, clever and very, very funny.
Her musicians are top-notch, particularly guitarist Justin Derrico, who I think ranks with the best (and I've seen Clapton, Hendrix, Townsend and Richards in concert.... couple years back!)
But if you are reading these reviews, you are probably already a fan. So the review should probably focus on this specific DVD and this concert. The DVD quality is excellent, and the photography really gives you a sense of being at the concert. My only small quibble is the quick edits- the average shot is probably less than two seconds. But concert and music videos have been trending that way for a long, long time and it's just something we Baby Boomers need to get used to, I suppose. But it's not bothersome enough to give the DVD less than five stars- I'd give it more if I could. Pink is not just an artist, she's a phenomenon, and this DVD makes that abundantly clear. It's a real joy to watch.",1407369600,2,1527,4.576642335766423

6031241,5,B00FTGYNUS,We loved this DVD. We went to her concert in 2014 and this DVD was just like being there. Great show,1398729600,,100,3.8095238095238093
6031242,5,B00FTGYNUS,"Great Songs, Great DVD ,  GREAT SHOW !!!  Love it  Love it Love it  Must have if you love P!nk",1397779200,,94,3.55
6031243,1,B00FTGYNUS,"I don't want to offend the hardcore fans of Pink, because I think this singer has done a lot of good. She's stood up and said that it's OK for women to be tomboys, or bisexuals, or to be different. She embraces imperfections. She has a great underlying message: Life is short, so be yourself and have fun.

But I'm going to be honest. I didn't like this DVD. I liked the Funhouse tour, but I'm starting to feel Pink doesn't have anything else to offer but sleaziness.  Pink has always been uninhibited about sex, but this show was almost nothing but sex. Lots of crotch-grabbing, ripped stockings, S&M references, and a bluegrass version of one of her songs featuring her band members simulating an orgy in front of a girl that looks about ten years old.

I feel like the pop world is polarized right now. Singers are either church going virgins or tattooed sex-party girls. I feel like young girls (and women) get pushed to be either one or the other with no inbetween. You can't just be an edgy female entertainer with tattoos and a sequin bikini, you also have to touch your crotch and body and let your dancers sleaze all over you.

I'm not insulting people who like this show, I'm just reviewing why it wasn't to my own taste.",1397520000,5,1231,4.457777777777777
6031244,5,B00FTGYNUS,"Saw this concert three times in person in 2013.  I had to get the DVD as soon as it came out.  I read some of the poor reviews, but it doesn't matter if you are a P!NK fan!  I have watched this DVD many times.  A fantastic performer and P!NK is way more than just a singer.  You won't believe this concert until you see it with your own eyes.  Yes, sure there is moving around with the camera work, but its a CONCERT!  It is a must to own for all true fans.  She has outdone herself, and can't wait to see what the next concert is going to be like.  The Funhouse tour DVD is awesome too.",1397088000,,587,3.865546218487395

6031248,4,B00FTGYNUS,"I love PINK.  However, the video takes too many quick cuts.  I need more than 3 seconds to appreciate her.  And, just because you have that many camera angles, doesn't mean you have to use them.  Toward the end of the concert much too much time is spent showing the audience.  I get it.  They're excited.  I want to see PINK !!",1395878400,,327,4.17741935483871
6031249,5,B00FTGYNUS,Quite a few members of my family went to one of her concerts recently and came home saying what a wonderful performance it was. Watching the DVD was the next best thing to going to one of her concerts.,1395187200,,201,4.17948717948718

6031252,5,B00FTGYNUS,"I have been a fan of P!nk for a very long time.  I had been considering buying this DVD for a very long time, and I'm so happy that I did.  She certainly knows how to put on an electrifying show.  From the first song to the spectacular showstopper, P!nk puts her all into it.  The energy and talent she possesses is a joy to watch when she puts on a show.  I would recommend this to anyone.  This is a lady who can sing live while doing acrobatics through the air.  She also shows love to her fans and truly seems to enjoy what she does.  I have watched this concert several times since purchasing it, and I cannot wait to buy more of her concerts on DVD!",1395014400,,655,4.023255813953488

6031264,5,B00FTGYNUS,Exciting and fun to watch. It's like you are in the best seats at the concert.  Pink is awesome. By far the best concert video I've seen.,1393804800,,137,4.074074074074074

6031270,5,B00FTGYNUS,Pink puts on an awesome show.  I saw this concert in New Jersey last March and the DVD was exactly as I saw it.  My teenage daughters couldn't make it to the actual concert so this was the next best thing!  She is an amazing performer!,1393545600,,235,4.065217391304348

6031273,5,B00FTGYNUS,P!nk is the ultimate performer!  She holds true in this video as she has in all the others...she shows her talent and just a smidgen of who she truly is behind the scenes.  I saw her in concert less than a month ago and this video is identical to her live show.,1393200000,,261,4.0
6031274,3,B00FTGYNUS,"I was all excited for this DVD to come out, but after reading the reviews, I think I will pass on the DVD and just buy the CD. Who wants to be dizzy, while listening to great music, in my living room ?!?!

I appreciate everyone's honest reviews.  THANK YOU",1393113600,,256,4.1
6031275,5,B00FTGYNUS,The DVD was pretty much the same as the concert. She put on a good show. Better that the one I saw in Seattle.,1393113600,,110,3.625

6031277,5,B00FTGYNUS,As always P!nk rocked this DVD. The DVD was my front row ticket to her Truth about Love Tour. If you love P!ink this is a must have for your collection.,1393113600,,152,3.935483870967742

6031282,3,B00FTGYNUS,"Went to see the P!nk ""Truth"" show in Chicago twice. I will have to rely on those memories to visualize it in my head while listening to this live concert DVD because I simply can't watch it. Fearing seizures --- way too many camera flips and bad edits. Makes me dizzy. Soundtrack is great though.",1392940800,,296,4.4
6031283,5,B00FTGYNUS,Just like the being there!  Great show. Her videos and concerts are awesome. If you didn't see her on tour you have to see this DVD. She is amazing.,1392940800,,148,4.103448275862069

6031285,5,B00FTGYNUS,Best Concert EVER and the DVD does a great job of showing that!  P!nk is an amazing performer and singer and this DVD of her latest tour showcases that beautifully!  A Must have!!!,1392768000,,180,4.424242424242424
6031286,3,B00FTGYNUS,"I am a HUGE Pink fan.  Went to this concert twice - both up close.  Incredible Concert!  Pink is the best entertainer ever!  Super talented and her stage presence is amazing.

That being said, unfortunately the person who edited this concert footabe was crazed!  He/she was trying to fit in all the action on the stage and it resulted in the viewer feeling like they are being jerked around on the wild mouse ride!  I was so disappointed because I wanted to really enjoy the choreography and focus in  on Pink.  Instead I was forced to watched constantly jerking images.  Well, not constantly .....

I would say go ahead and buy it - or rent it- especially if you haven't seen her because she is quite amazing.  Actually, there is some really good footage of her flying around at the end - and when she is up in the iron ball.  They were unique perspectives even if you have seen the concert live.

I hope she has this footage re-edited.  I'd buy that one too.",1392681600,3,960,4.405714285714286
6031287,5,B00FTGYNUS,"LOVE P!NK LOVE THIS DVD, TRUTH ABOUT LOVE TOUR WAS THE BEST SHOW I'VE SEEN. AND I HAVE BEEN GOING TO CONCERTS SINCE I WAS 12, 30+ YEARS AGO!! I SAW THIS 4 TIMES HERE IN SO. CAL.",1392422400,,177,3.6842105263157894

6031289,5,B00FTGYNUS,"P!nk is among the few pop artist I am a fan of, and I would definitely see live if she didn't sell out the venue so quickly. I was so excited to see this announced on her website. If you loved her Grammy's or MTV Video Music Awards performances, than I recommend ordering this DVD, there is so many elements to her show. This a pretty awesome show and she sound better than ever, and the Can't Take Me Home part of the show was a real treat. I wish this was a DVD and CD combo.",1392336000,,477,3.9278350515463916
6031290,5,B00FTGYNUS,"I almost didn't buy it after reading the reviews.  My love of Pink won out.  That and my collection would be incomplete as I own all of her CDs and DVDs.  :)  It is 'busy' but her shows have soooo much going on.  The DVD captured the entire experience.  I recommend it highly to any Pink fan.  As a matter of fact, I liked her even more after watching her interaction with the audience.  I think the recording further confirms that Pink appreciates her band, dancers and crew.  They are just as much of the show as she is.",1392336000,,522,4.191919191919192
6031291,4,B00FTGYNUS,I bought this on the recommendation of People Magazine and then backed up by ITunes.  I don't buy videos of music concerts so this was a first. Both recommendations raved about it.  I'm glad I bought it because I would never have been able to see the concert live and just hearing the music you miss out on some of the awesome performance that Pink puts out.  I got my money's worth for sure.  In fact I feel like I got more than my Money's worth because I felt like I got almost as good an experience as the people who attended the concert and they paid a heck of a lot more money for their tickets.  Very very good quality sound and videography.,1392163200,,647,4.185483870967742
6031292,4,B00FTGYNUS,"I absolutely LOVED this concert in person and this video is a perfect way for me to re-live it.  Unfortunately, like the other reviewers, the camera work was too much.  P!nk is incredibly entertaining and the busy, fast camera work isn't necessary.  I want to watch this video so I feel as if I'm at the concert again, not flashing to a different scene every 3 seconds.  But again, this concert is AMAZING and P!nk is an incredible performer.",1391990400,,442,4.556962025316456
6031293,4,B00FTGYNUS,"I ordered this Pink concert but beware it is not what is advertised on the picture. I received a cleaned up, censored version, not the explicit lyrics version as is on the picture here. I emailed two other sellers and they also only had the censored version. So I ended up buying the explicit version from Pink's website. I know to some it doesn't matter, but I like my music exactly they way the artist does it. i have no",1391904000,,422,4.2875

6031295,5,B00FTGYNUS,I don't understand the bad reviews some r reporting! I think it is awesome and Great! P!nk is awesome! I went to see this tour live and I'm happy to relive the best show I've ever seen! Worth every penny! And thank u Amazon I got my DVD within 24 hours! Wasn't expecting it until Monday and its Friday! Awesome!,1391731200,,311,4.2

6031298,5,B00FTGYNUS,"While I was buying this DVD regardless, the people responsible for editing it should be BANNED forever from editing.  There is more time spent on the fans, far away views and seeing how many shots they can fit into each second of viewing time, than on P!NK herself.  For anyone who went to her concert and saw all the funny or just little cute things that she did, you will not see them on this video.  The quality of the video overall is less than I would have expected, at times it looked like it was made with a iPhone and not professional cameras.  With that being said, it's still PINK and she is phenomenal and an amazing performer.  Hopefully she will get the crew that made the videos for the other tours back for the next DVD and permanently fire this bunch. I did give this DVD 5 stars, not for quality of the video, but for PINK and her band for just being amazing.",1391644800,,876,4.253012048192771
6031299,3,B00FTGYNUS,"I attended this tour in Charlotte, NC back in March of 2013 and at first I said this is awesome. However as I look back and now re-watched basically the same concert I can't help but think P!nk should try to grow up some. While The Truth About Love as a whole is a critically acclaimed album it is far from her best effort, and when does love always mean trashy sexual remarks at a show? Truth is she is a mother now and has a husband and to put stuff out like this is 10 years outdated. The one tour that I believe was her best was the Funhouse tour, it wasn't over the top in references or anything it was just a darn good show. This one not so much. I will say her voice is great, as always its just her tour appearance makes me wonder what music has come to.",1391558400,,762,3.9545454545454546
6031300,5,B00FTGYNUS,The editing is a bit jumping during the first 3 songs but everything calms down afterwards and it is a great concert! I have seen her live it is almost as good! :),1391472000,,163,3.9696969696969697
6031301,5,B00FTGYNUS,I was down in the dumps and listened to one of her songs.  It perked me up and life wasn't so bad after all.,1391126400,,108,3.5
6031302,5,B00FTGYNUS,I was fortunate enough to see this show twice when it was on tour so I bought the DVD in the hopes that it would take me back to those wonderful moments and that I would see things I may have missed when I was standing in the pit.  It did all that and more.  I jumped off my couch and danced around my living room singing along at the top of my lungs too many times to count.  If you have never seen P!nk live then this is DVD is your perfect introduction!  The only thing it made me wish is that I could see her in Australia because the crowd was just so much more pumped and active then when I saw her in Texas.  :),1391126400,,617,3.7890625

6031305,5,B00FTGYNUS,"I have seen this tour 2x live. and I will have to agree with the person talking about the jumping around with the camera... but... If you saw it live, you will see there is so much going on, you would be feeling the same thing being there live.

She is the most spectacular live performer/singer of this generation. She sings LIVE while doing all her air stunts & really feels her fans. She's also the most relatable singer out there. This DVD was nothing short of amazing! I very highly recommend it. You will want to play it over and over!,1390435200,,428,4.797297297297297
6031313,2,B00FTGYNUS,"I was so excited to buy P!nks Truth About Love concert DVD. In part because she puts on a great show and in part because I recently saw that particular concert at the Staples Center with some good friends. So, I was a bit curious when I saw she had a bluegrass version of Slut Like You. Nothing could have prepared me for the level of offensive disrespect I saw in that video. It was disgusting and totally failed at being funny.

In the video, it showed funny caricatures of hillbillies. Among them were her band and dancers with blacked-out teeth,  women were pregnant and drinking beer some of them seeming underage. They were yucking it up in every offensive way imaginable. The only thing missing was obvious incest.

I just cannot understand how mocking hillbillies is any different than dressing as queens and mocking the LGBT community, or mocking any other whole group of people. Or maybe someone can explain how this is different than if they had all put on black face and mocked African Americans?

Maybe it is because we collectively think we are smarter than hillbillies and therefore they deserve to be mocked.

No group of people DESERVE to be mocked. Let me just say that I am a fairly liberal progressive and I do not watch Duck Dynasty or Honey Boo Boo, I do not know any hillbillies or red necks but I would like to think that am mature enough to treat them with human dignity, as I would any other group being attacked unfairly.

Of course this seems to be her attitude toward people who believe tolerance should be for everyone and not just a pet group of people.

This is depressing coming from someone like P!NK who gives lip service to tolerance and love toward others. There is a reason that I usually avoid learning personal beliefs or values of my favorite entertainers. I do not watch TMZ or read most interviews so that I can continue to enjoy their work. This is why. It was sad for me to learn that P!NK is klassy with a k.",1390435200,,1954,4.47191011235955
6031314,5,B00FTGYNUS,"You can never go wrong with a live show put on by Pink....best performer out there. Visually, vocally out of this world.",1390435200,,120,4.5
6031315,5,B00FTGYNUS,"I had the opportunity to catch this tour at the Nassau Coliseum. I was in awe with Pink. She has an amazing voice, puts on an incredible show and the acrobatics are crazy. Watching the DVD was like reliving the show, only seeing things I did not catch seeing the show live. It's a DVD that I would watch again and again.
Now waiting for the next tour!!!",1390348800,,353,4.205882352941177
6031316,4,B00FTGYNUS,"This isn't really any different than the Funhouse DVD,  It was a great concert and she sounded awesome.  I was only disappointed that she didn't sing a few of the older songs and the song Truth About Love, but it is what it is and it will be fun to watch while on the treadmill!  If you like PINK...get it!",1390348800,,306,4.066666666666666
6031317,5,B00FTGYNUS,"After watching the Epix version I was kind of worried, the editing was bad, it was very busy and showed very little of her. Of course the streaming was an issue too but after getting the actual DVD, it was soo much better!!! I really enjoyed it!!!! My family and I are very happy with the DVD and will watch is many times. We saw this show in NC back in March and it was fantastic.. I highly recommend the DVD. And to clear some confusion up, it is in English !!!!",1390262400,,464,4.054347826086956
6031318,3,B00FTGYNUS,"The editing is too much! Very quick clips take away from this DVD. The show was FANTASTIC in person. I saw three of them. If you own her other two DVDs, this is completely different visually, however, the vocals are great. It could have been so much better. I get trying something new, but give the brain a chance to process what is it seeing before changing scenes every few seconds. Another reviewer mentioned dizzying, I totally agree. It gets three stars for the vocals and concert.",1390262400,,486,4.597701149425287
6031319,4,B00FTGYNUS,"I have been to 2 of the ""Truth About Love"" tour shows and enjoyed each one immensely.  I've been a huge P!NK fan since seeing the Funhouse tour DVD in 2009.  I even have P!NK FAN on my Ohio license plates.
But, that said, I must admit that the jumpy editing of this concert has taken away much from this DVD.  I have to agree with other comments that talk about the jumping from scene to scene.  The continuity with the music is there, but with each image on view for only seconds, it is hard to watch and focus on something you'd like to follow on stage.
I'm a big fan of Eva Gardner, too, and tried to find and follow her on this DVD, but it was almost as if she wasn't there.  From being at the shows, I knew where to look, but had trouble seeing her more than just a very few times in the 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Like the Funhouse tour DVD, this one has images that last from one to 6 seconds max on screen,  My calculations say that for the one hour and 50 minutes there must be between 4,000 and 5,000 images used to make this DVD.  I'm amazed they could keep the music in sync.
But that frantic image changing, and the many shots of the audience singing along captures the energy that is present at a P!NK concert.  The audience is part of the show and no one sits for any of it.  Everyone is on their feet and the DVD catches that energy.
But, I wish I would have been able to follow the dancers through their routines and see Eva Gardner doing her thing.
I still recommend this DVD for those who didn't get to see the tour shows to see what it was like and for those who did to relive it.",1390089600,19,1596,4.009463722397476
6031320,1,B00FTGYNUS,"I was so looking forward to getting this DVD but after hearing about the merry go round of editing, I will pass. I have her 1st concert on DVD which was shot this way also. Great show but HORRIFIC editing. I threw it out. The other 2 dvds inbetween are much better.

Pink if you are out there, please go back, re-edit the dvd and re-release!!!",1389830400,,343,4.196969696969697
6031321,5,B00FTGYNUS,Alecia Moore is just the best female performer ever. She really knows how to put on a stellar concert. No lip singing:),1389398400,,119,4.454545454545454
6031322,3,B00FTGYNUS,Went to see P!nk twice on this tour and LOVED her and the concert was an amazing performance by all of the dancers/singers/acrobats/musicians but it was difficult to watch this DVD and enjoy. The quick camera cutaways are annoying and it was hard to focus on any of the wonderful performances. I am giving it 3 stars since P!nk is amazing but I certainly enjoyed the youtube clips of her concerts more.,1388448000,33,402,4.597222222222222
6031323,4,B00FTGYNUS,"Unlike some of the bufoons here who have written a review for something they haven't even seen yet - I have.  I enjoyed this concert DVD very much. After all it is Pink!  Some have complained about the editing; quick cuts, etc.  This is not done constantly throughout the concert as some imply.  Yes, when it is done it can be a bit annoying but it certainly did not ruin the viewing experience for me. It is not as terrible as some make it out to be.  If you are a Pink fan this is a must have and you will certainly enjoy it as I did.  It is a wonderful production and Pink is in top form.  Her aerial acrobatics during the show are always a highlight. To any of you upset about the release date, etc. a product review is not the place to air your grievances. If you don't like the editing then let those responsible know how you feel.  Not purchasing this is not the solution.  And please do not compose an alleged review unless you have actually watched this.  I love Pink and loved watching this.  She is an amazing woman with incredible talent.  Some are blowing this editing thing way out of proportion.  In my humble opinion this concert DVD/Blu-ray is certainly worth acquiring.  Don't let the naysayers persuade you from not viewing this great concert.",1388361600,3,1262,4.383620689655173
