7855728,5,6303920160,Love this film. Saw it years ago and knew it was a hidden gem. Stephen Baldwin and Emily Lloyd were fantastic together.  Chris Penn is awesome as a psychotic escaped convict. The whole film has a nice vibe. I recommend it.,1359158400,,222,4.414634146341464
7855729,5,6303920160,This is a great indie comedy starring Stephen Baldwin about a bunch of Hawaiian wannabees living a boring existance in Arizona. It's a must see action/comedy!!,1107302400,4,159,5.153846153846154
