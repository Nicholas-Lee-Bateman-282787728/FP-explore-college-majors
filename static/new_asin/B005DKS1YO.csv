Pertinent story applicable to numerous folk coming to Cali from all over the world to 'make it' in Hollywood. It flows with well placed bits of drama and humor. Good enough for me to send copies to Sulo's cousins and other relatives. Great Job!

8574189,5,B005DKS1YO,"Convincing Clooney  was funny, yet touching.  Very clever screenplay, and the acting was excellent, very believable.  Loved the music, very enjoyable movie.  I'll be looking forward to the next movie by Sulo Williams!",1325980800,,217,5.484848484848484
8574190,4,B005DKS1YO,"For those of you who haven't stepped into the independent film world, this isn't a bad way to start. I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The ""breaking into the film industry"" idea has been done to death, but Convincing Clooney was a fresh take on an old theme.
Wilson Cruz who I remember from the tv show with Claire Danes ""My So Called Life,"" stole the scene every time he was on screen and the two leads were a joy to watch. I was initially a little off put by what I thought was an unresolved ending, but when I watched it again with my daughter, she saw it differently. This is an unrated film and there is sparse profanity, but I was told ""it's not worse than anything I hear at school, Mom!""",1325808000,,722,4.201438848920863
