6637720,5,B00NBIGJAS,"This was the first CINERAMA movie I ever saw as a kid of about 7. It has always stayed with me and I even have the original souvenir program! The main memory is of the runaway train.

This wonderfully restored version is a real throw back to the 1950s. The sights you see, you now see on the National Geographic or IMAX and are sights that you may take so much for granted these days.

But presented in CINERAMA, you must place yourself back in those days so that you can be blown away with the images unfolding across that gigantic CINERAMA screen. Having a home cinema with video projector and an 8ft screen helps.

It is also fun to see where the ""joins"" of the 3 strip projection are, which to me is the special memory. So they are well presented here and not too distracting but still fun to see where they are.

This and the other CINERAMA restored films are a unique collection of a different era. Extremely well restored by David Strohmaier and his team who obviously had a unique challenge on a limited budget to give us this extraordinary step back in time.

Thoroughly recommended.",1418169600,9,1092,4.44
6637721,5,B00NBIGJAS,"This is the travelogue film to end all travelogue films. The magic that was Cinerama provides spectacular shots of some of the world's greatest natural wonders, and looks fabulous in Blu-Ray. You can dispute which natural wonders were selected, and the lengthy sequences devoted to the pomp and ceremony of St. Peter's square, but you can't dispute that Lowell Thomas and his crew provides some beautiful photography of hard-to-reach, much less photograph, sites. Admittedly, much of the dialogue and voice-over material is dated; certainly no one would speak of the beauty of Mt. Fujiyama and Geisha Girls in the same breath today as the film does. You can, of course, turn the corny commentary and the fake storylines off and just enjoy the scenery.",1418169600,5,751,5.064516129032258

6637723,5,B00NBIGJAS,"I remember seeing the first Cinerama film  This Is Cinerama  in a theater in Trenton, NJ when it opened in 1952-53. It was an amazing experience. Im sure I saw at least one other Cinerama film  probably Cinerama Holiday but not all of them  And Im pretty sure I never saw Seven Wonders of the World  until now. Thanks to the Cinerama Company  which still exists and holds the original negatives  and Flicker Alley who is making them available on DVD and Blu-ray  we can sort of relive the experience.

There are a couple of rather lengthy reviews of this combo BD/DVD set here already and the go into the technical details. Ill refer you to those and concentrate on the massive amount of bonus features which I didn't see being discussed.
But first my brief take on the package. As others have said, Cinerama was shown on a LARGE  (curved) screen. How much you experience the film will depend on the size of your TV screen. Anything 60 or more should work. My 42 inch flat screen was a bit small for the full experience. And the Cinerama theaters had SEVEN speaker stereo sound.  So, the sound transfer is great  as is the music  but most folks don't have a seven speaker system in their home entertainment center.  The restoration here is great. The set includes a repro of the program booklet but it has been reduced from 8 x12 (I still have my original from This Is Cinerama to 5x7 inches so it is hard to read without a magnifying glass.

So now to the bonuses. The most important one  and the best  is a NEW hour-long documentary of the music composers for ALL the films. Big names like Max Steiner, Dmitri Tiompkin, and David Raksin were hired to write the music and four experts on Film Music discuss the scores for nearly 5 of the films  including this one. Its rare that I suggest that people watch the bonus features first but, in this case I can say youll get more from the film if you watch this one first.

There is also a fascinating 15 minute FRENCH documentary (in black and white with clear English subtitles) which explained the Cinerama tent shows in Europe. Large tracks would arrived and mount a tent that would hold 3,000 (!) people for 2 shows a day and then move to another city just 30 miles away. All sold out! Great bonus.  I wasn't sure what I Breakdown reel was when I saw it listed as a bonus but I learned about it in the composer documentary. This was a non-widescreen film recorded by narrator (and Producer) Lowell Thomas to be shown in case one of the three required projectors broke or the film snapped. This would be shown to fill time. This DVD includes 11 minutes of Thomas filling time with stories and apologizing. Its actually pretty funny!

Theres a short newsreel clip on the opening of Seven Wonders in New York and a newly filmed documentary of the restoration process for Seven Wonders.

These films capture a time near the end  and just after  the Korean War and preserve images no longer there.  Im still getting used to the Smilebox format to recreate the experience but I am grateful to be able to see these films again.

So far Flicker Alley has only released the travelogues. I wonder if How The West Was Won will be able to be restored. That was a fictional story I think many would like to see again, or for the first time.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6637724,5,B00NBIGJAS,"I first saw Cinerama features on a boat trip to Europe in 1964. They were HOW THE WEST WAS WON, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD, and my personal favorite THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF THE BROTHERS GRIMM (I later saw KRAKATOA: EAST OF JAVA in a theater). It was a German liner that showed the 3 Cinerama features alternated with 3 German Edgar Wallace features (along with ""grown up"" movies I wasn't supposed to see) over the course of the 6 day journey. These were probably the commercial releases as opposed to the actual 3 screen versions but they were the biggest movies I had ever seen and the traveling camera shots (the train in WEST, the carriage in GRIMM) were overwhelming. I had heard of the travelogues like this one and THIS IS CINERAMA but I never saw them. When Flicker Alley sent me an advance copy of this to review, I was positively delighted as it brought back memories of my shipboard experiences.

Made in 1957, SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD shows us a very different world than the one we have today. A world that seemed so much larger, places that were so much farther away and oh so exotic! The opening shots of flying out of New York City down the Hudson River (in a special Pan Am 4 propeller Clipper) give you the best visual idea I have ever seen of just how big NYC is and this was almost 60 years ago. But that's only the beginning. After a brief stop in Rio, it's over to Asia to visit Japan, Cambodia, and India with an extended sequence involving a runaway train in Darjeeling (to show off the Cinerama camerawork). Then to Africa to see Watusi warriors in the then Belgian Congo and then a sequence in Saudi Arabia with pipelines in the desert which is more than interesting in retrospect considering the situation in the Middle East today. The film ends in Rome with a tour of the Vatican and a special blessing from then Pope Pius XII who is now a controversial figure because of the Holocaust.

As with all Cinerama productions, the cinematography is breathtaking. The restoration in the Smilebox technology captures the curved look of the original presentation though even the biggest flatscreen TV won't do it justice but remember, size isn't everything. Just to be able to see the world as it once was and to hear producer-narrator Lowell Thomas' commentary, which varies from informative to colonial to downright sexist on occasion, is a historical record in itself and tells us a lot about where we were in 1957 and how the World and our attitudes have changed. The $49.95 price tag will appear steep to some and compared to your average DVD/Blu Ray, it is, but when you consider that you get a Blu/Ray, 2 DVDs (one of bonus features), a reproduction of the original booklet (although the print is very small and requires magnification) then the price isn't so bad after all. An absolute must for anyone interested in cinema technique and/or world history.",1414800000,21,2887,4.582205029013539
6637725,4,B00NBIGJAS,"Disclaimer: These comments are made on based on the SmileBox Cinerama process already released:  THIS IS CINERAMA, CINERAMA HOLIDAY and HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD has not yet been released and this is NOT a review of this specific title.  The comments made about this specific title are based on seeing the actual Cinerama three projector presentation at the New Neon Cinerama Theatre in Dayton OH.

The Cinerama titles are, in short, travelogues (except HTWWW) -- either you like that genre or you don't.  Think AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS but without the silly story and nonsense circus act that is thrown in.  In these productions, it is straight-forward narration which tends to be a bit stiff and old-school with Lowell Thomas, a famous commentator of the day, delivering the dialogue in matter-of-fact, Walter Cronkite-ish style.  As dry as it might seem today, it does the job as the real star are the spectacular visuals as well as the lush music soundtrack in 6 channel sound.  The cinematography was superb in each of these Cinerama productions and if the processing and transfer of the other Cinerama releases is any indication this transfer should be as good as you would expect from original large format negatives -- three to be exact -- with each larger than the normal 35mm frame so there is more film geography (which equates to higher resolution) than even on the present-day IMAX format.

The digital processing that is used in the BluRay releases to eliminates or tries to eliminate the two join lines (from the three strips of original 35mm film) is much more effective than the mechanical method that was used in the original Cinerama projectors; the projectors simply used a moving device at the edges of the film aperture which basically just blurred the join lines where the three projected images met on the screen.  With today's super sophisticated digital processing, the software can actually match pixels to pixels, resulting in a image that for all intents and purposes, eliminates the join lines -- it's quite astounding actually how effective it does it, at least based on how good the other releases look -- you barely notice the joins and I dare say no one in 1956 saw an image that flawless -- the join lines were always visible in the Cinerama film presentations of the day.

Next comes the novel SmileBox process, in which the image is manipulated to simulate the original, deeply curved 2.59:1 aspect ratio as it appeared to the eye of the spectator viewing it in a Cinerama theatre.  This is the same process used in the other Cinerama BluRay releases.  The manipulation of the image does a fairly good job of introducing a representation of that deep curve as it looked in a Cinerama theatre, but the software does it without introducing any of the kind of geometric distortion you would expect to see doing such a drastic thing to what essentially on the film is a normal rectangular image.  Thankfully the process does not cause horizon lines do bow as you would expect when an image is so distorted -- but they don't; it's quite an achievement.  Any such distortion that is visible will be what was inherent in the original cinematography and there will be some as has been the case with the other SmileBox Cinerama releases.  The computer does not compensate for the distortion in some shots that is due to the Cinerama camera lenses themselves.  SmileBox seems to do exactly what it's supposed to, i.e., make you experience the same presentation you would have gotten in an actual Cinerama theatre in 1956.

The one caveat -- the SmileBox effectiveness is really lost on all but the largest displays.  To actually experience what it feels like to see a Cinerama presentation the SmileBox image needs to presented with a video projector on a screen large enough that will give an image that can fully engulf the viewer's entire field of view.  Smaller screens will simply make SmileBox ineffective and it will just look like an oddly shaped, butterfly image sitting in the middle of the TV screen -- totally defeating the process and creating an image that most viewers would not want to sit thru for 2 hours.  That said, get thyself a good video projector and a 10 foot projection screen and throw THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD up on that and THEN you've got yourself something!

Sound mix of each of these releases (and they have been consistent, so the assumption is this release will follow suit) mimics the original 6 channel mix nearly perfectly.  The orchestrations have so far have had plenty of punch and presence and while not the aggressive, overly mic-ed mixes that are the norm today, there is something to be said for the very natural sounding stereo field that they were able to obtain using more conservative mic placements of the day.  Remember this was a time when some stunning stereophonic recordings were made using only two precisely placed microphones (the substantial library from Mercury Records' ""Living Presence"" series were famous for that simple two mic technique). If this sound mix is anything like THIS IS CINERAMA, the result should be a very natural,  rich 7.1 Dolby Surround format with a wide stereo soundfield that benefits from the conservative mic-ing technique.

The DOWN side -- well, nothing more glaring than the absurd price point for this release.  SmileBox or no SmileBox, there is NO reason for this to come in at $45.  First off, the description does not indicate that at the very least there will be a standard version as well as the SmileBox, although the assumption is that it will contain a normal version as well.  I guess they are going to force this release to be one of those wait-until-the-price-drops deal for the smart consumer.",1413763200,9,5756,4.809330628803245
6637736,5,B00NBIGJAS,"First of all, I purchased this DVD relying on the comments of reviewer ""Hite"" and he is correct. It plays just fine in my standard Sony BluRay unit. It is a special DVD, indeed. Two additional DVD's are included. Also in the package is a reproduction of the original souvenir booklet from the Melba Theatre in Dallas, Texas. This is the same theatre where I first saw ""This Is Cinerama"" in the early 1950's and one or two of the succeeding productions. I saw the later Cinerama films at the Windsor Cinerama Theatre in Houston. In 1937 the first edition of Richard Halliburton's ""Book of Marvels"" was published. In 1937 there were motion picture news reels, but, there were no television sets in every home. Halliburton's images were found only in books. Halliburton's book included the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, one of which was the Pyramids of Giza and are still standing. He also covered the wonders of the modern world, both natural and man made. In the late 1940's and early 1950's Fred Waller was working on his motion picture technological breakthrough and tapped Lowell Thomas to be the narrator of his first release, ""This Is Cinerama"". Thomas continued to be involved in the various subsequent Cinerama productions and this one, the ""Seven Wonders of the World"" was his next to last effort in Waller's new medium. Even though this is vastly abbreviated in it's coverage of world wonders as compared to Halliburton's texts, Halliburton himself would have been amazed at the images that are shown in this Cinerama production. Cinerama was responsible for the later developments of Cinemiracle, CinemaScope, Todd AO, 3D, Super Panavision 70 and the IMAX that we have today.",1455580800,,1690,4.9125874125874125

6637743,5,B00NBIGJAS,"A great film, beautifully restored. Hard to believe this film was made sixty years ago & the multi channel sound quality is equally impressive. Growing up in So Cal, our family saw all of the Cinerama films (except the Bros Grimm) at the Warner Hollywood theater. Watching & listening to these wonderful films on Smilebox & Blu-ray & an above average 5.1 sound system, bring back fond memories.

We should all thank David Strohmaher for the remarkable work he has done restoring the Cinerama films. Thanks too to his friends & associates & software developers who worked for free or on the cheap in the restoration process, with out their passion for Cinerama, these films would have been lost forever. I really enjoyed the bonus disc & the piece on the various music composers. I highly recommend this DVD set.",1430956800,,811,4.792857142857143
6637744,4,B00NBIGJAS,"I never got to see this Cinerama film when it was released, but I had heard about the thrilling runaway train sequence and bought this set for that alone. As with ""This Is Cinerama"" this is a big exciting travalogue with no real story or plot. That would come later with ""How the West Was Won"". Seven Wonders entertains with Fred Mantz's skillful aunt flying tricks, including his trademark bridge fly-unders. We see beautiful exotic scenes such as Japan's geishas, cherry blossoms, and the famous Kamakura Budha. The train ride in India, complete with a bit of comic silliness, did not disappoint. One very historic scene of which I was not previously aware and which moved me deeply, was the Papal blessing by then-Pope Pius XII, at Castel Gandalfo. This amazing section was shot both from the crowd's viewpoint and then in closeup at the pope's balcony. I can imagine devout audience members making the sign of the cross as they watched.
I was surprise see at the gorgeous color and by the smoothed ""seams"" where the three filmstrips join. They were much more noticeable I the theater as I remember. Since I don't have access to a theater that shows these wonderful historic pieces of cinematic history, I gladly paid what I consider a premium to add it to my personal collection.",1430352000,,1283,4.757847533632287

I get closer to the screen for this type of film in its ""smile box"" format to relive the memories. Thank you for getting these films out on home video! I never thought that I would be able to see these ""Seven Wonders"" again. It is a real triumph of film-making, and I would recommend the purchase to anyone seriously interested in the Cinerama technique that was used with incredible effectiveness.

8677209,5,B00NBIGJAS,"No matter how much I heard about this movie before seeing it, and I had not seen it before, I still did not know how good it was going to be. And I have no other documentaries in my collection. This one is just so sweeping, from the languorous crisscrossing of New York in the Fifties, to the startling beauty and low aerial flyovers of the expanses of Rio de Janerio, this was a dazzling showcase of the times and format. The Cinerama Clipper seems to float over the desert but with great, swooping banked turns still showing the pyramids and famed places you've longed to visit. A review would be inseparable from the times and locals so long and far ago shown, and I am sure nostalgia is a part of it all, but somehow the film felt fresh and still in keeping with reality.  If ""Reality in Cinerama"" is or could be your thing, there's an awesome globe circling feast in store for you.",1507766400,,886,4.337349397590361

Presented in the Smilebox format and sitting up close to my 55"" TV, I can pretty much visualize the effect these films had on the moviegoing public of the 50s. The borders of the three images are not very noticeable and the results are thrilling. Who can forget the roller coaster ride at the beginning of the first film ?
