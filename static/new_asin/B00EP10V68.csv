5931989,5,B00EP10V68,"First made available overseas in 1964 as a tribute to our fallen President, it is very nice to see this released domestically on DVD. From inauguration to burial, this film covers JFK's presidency with remarkably high-quality (and often color) footage. His speeches still have an intensely haunting quality to them, nearly fifty years after his death. and the phases of Kennedy's New Frontier are presented more or less sequentially. This was produced not long after Kennedy's assassination, so a certain amount of lionizing is natural. However, the film on balance does a very nice job of capturing JFK's time in office - a time when America's hopes seemed so achievable. Gregory Peck does an excellent job of narrating, and the soundtrack is beautiful. If you are looking for a great primer on the administration of JFK, this is an excellent candidate for the job.",1384387200,8,866,5.020833333333333
5931990,5,B00EP10V68,"I taped this documentary off of cable years ago and have watched it endlessly. It takes us through the Presidency of JFK and at certain points, flashes forward to Nov. 1963 at the time of his assassination. This Documentary is really one that should not be missed. Gregory Peck is the narrator and does a phenomenal job.
This DVD does not and will not cover any conspiracy theories of any kind, that is not what this Documentary is about so if that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere, you won't find it here.",1384214400,16,517,4.4526315789473685
5931991,5,B00EP10V68,"This documentary, produced for overseas distribution in the mid 60's focuses on the six faces of Kennedy's New Frontier. The footage is very good and much of it is in color. The narration and musical score is impressive. Yes, it is a propaganda film put out by the US Information Agency and portrays Kennedy in the best possible light, but given the era that it was produced, one can understand the whole Camelot theme. The funeral sequences are sad to watch.",1381708800,26,459,4.679012345679013
5931992,5,B00EP10V68,This is the best documentary of JFK i've ever seen. It is narrarated by Gregory Peck .It covers JFK's Inagural to his burial at Arlington. It covers the 6 phases of the New Frontier in retrospective. The sountrack is amazing and his speech in Berlin is a Haunting echo. This was released in 1964 for overseas distribution. Im very happy it is finally being legitimatly released. I will own it.,1378684800,31,393,4.628571428571429

5931997,5,B00EP10V68,"This stirring movie narrated by Gregory Peck, gives a good overview of the short but amazing presidency of JFK as weel as the profooud day of mourning when he was buried. All the salient points are reviewed, the Cuba Missile Crisis, the space race, the Berlin visit, the Peace Corps, the cultural facelift of Washington. It's comprised of historic footage that is nicely edited, scored and narrated. Also on this disk is the famous Kennedy-Nixon debate. Quite honestly, I thought Nixon came off a lot better than history recalls. Yes, he did sweat a bit but there really isn't a so-called five o'clock shadow. I thought his answers were good, but I guess Kennedy's were better. Kennedy was certainly easier on the eye. Either way, it's a great debate, and a lot more civilized than the ones we have today.",1298073600,6,805,4.757142857142857

The visual quality is amazing.  I am a history teacher and I thought that I had seen all of the footage relevant to the administration of JFK but there was footage that was new to me.  I especially appreciated the inclusion of Chopin's funeral march.  There is a wonderful section with people from all over the world paying homage to the late president sent against a background of the funeral drums.  Bravo, Bruce Herschensohn!

5932007,3,B00EP10V68,"I have several books and dvds about JFK. This one has a lot of good newsreel footage and a completely favorable-to-Kennedy narration by Gregory Peck. There is no criticism here, or any historical context for his presidency beyond what is briefly said about the newsreel footage and a few excerpts from speeches.

I didn't really mind that because I think there's definitely a place for dvds that remind people all of the great things he accomplished in only 2 years and 10 months and how good his leadership skills were--not only the inspiring words, but also matching them with actions--including things that ordinary Americans could participate in, too, like the Peace Corps.

But I had to give it only 3 stars (it could have been lower) because of how it failed as education. There is absolutely no chronology in this material. Events are mentioned, speeches are shown (often at a completely different time than the event being discussed occurred, though you wouldn't know it from this) but no dates are given for anything. Good luck if you want to look up a speech or find out what events might have led to the building of the Berlin Wall.

Which came first, Berlin or the Cuban Missile Crisis? You'd never know from this (or any other dates for important events of Kennedy's presidency). On civil rights, there's a sentence about Eisenhower and Little Rock...then a clip of Kennedy's speech in support of Civil Rights before he sent legislation to Congress...then a clip of federal troops assisting James Meredith in enrolling in college in Alabama.  Again, zero dates given.

And Kennedy's speech came in 1963, near the end of his presidency. He -evolved- as a champion of racial equality, but he didn't start out that way; in the beginning he was worried that too much activism would get so much resistance from Southern Democrats that it would do more harm than good. In this dvd, you'd think it was easy and he'd been a great advocate for all that was needed all along.

It may sound like a small thing--identifying dates and places for events and speeches--giving some idea of when things really happened. But I think it's a huge flaw in a documentary, a history, to have everything just ""hanging out there"" coterminous. It doesn't let you see the progress of his presidency or fully appreciate, imo, his achievements. I was very very disappointed.",1394409600,,2358,4.838709677419355

5932013,5,B00EP10V68,This DVD release is a superb print vastly superior to the one that was broadcast on cable 20 years ago. Probably the best documentary about JFK's presidency because it does not contain all the negative revisionist views of the late president.

5932016,5,B00EP10V68,"I first saw this documentary film on television in 1973, and then one time later in the 1970s. I remembered the content as being good but the video quality was poor, so I was hesitant to buy the DVD.

If you're looking for a documentary film of the assassination events in November 1963, the 1964 film ""Four Days In November"" is exceptional, as is the 2009 History Channel film ""JFK - 3 Shots That Changed America"".

""Years Of Lightning, Day of Drums"" however is a documentary of the events in the 3 years of the Kennedy presidency, bookended by the assassination and funeral.

It is a superior documentary and a major selling point is the PRISTINE, EXCEPTIONAL, CRYSTAL-CLEAR video quality. I have NEVER seen this footage presented in such sharp, vivid color anywhere else, in any other documentary or news program, and there are many clips of President Kennedy not shown in any other documentaries. The producers obviously had the original source material and used it for this film.

So if like me you had seen this film on TV years ago and it didn't look very good, don't hesitate to buy this, you will be impressed.",1384819200,15,1119,4.66497461928934
5932017,5,B00EP10V68,"At long last, a restored version of this long ago documentary. Thanks to Warner Brothers and modern technology, we can now see this landmark film about President John F. Kennedy as it looked when it was first released in 1965. After having only poor quality, faded and timeworn videos and ""home-made"" DVD's copied from old video tapes  of this movie, it is wonderful to finally be able to have a DVD of this movie restored to the clarity and color of the original.  Have waited a long time and searched high and low for this, and now, after nearly 50 years, it is finally here. It will never be HD, but this is as good as it's going to be. And that is VERY good. Very worthwhile owning and viewing for those interested in US history, and particularly JFK.  It is important to remember that this film was originally made by the U.S. Information Agency/Voice of America (CIA) as a propaganda film only for foreign consumption, but an act of Congress made it available for showing here in the USA in 1965 (or 1966). So therefore, its POV is as a tribute to the late President Kennedy and an uncritical statement of policy continuity from the assassinated President to his successor, LBJ.  It also parrots the (now discredited) Warren Report conclusions about one lone assassin, Oswald, but leaving those issues aside, it is a remarkable film juxtaposing the vitality and excitement of the Kennedy administration with scenes from the ""four days"" of his funeral services and world wide mourning. And as icing on the cake, the narration by the great Gregory Peck adds gravitas and classic timelessness to the subject matter.

Highly recommended for all those interested in the Kennedy years and their impact on Americans and people around the world.",1384473600,19,1743,4.777408637873754

Yet it is history and we never recovered from the myth and sorrow.  The film was made right after his death and condemned a lone crazed assassin in the time nobody knew the truth of the Kennedy's  or why anybody had something on him  I was five years old when the assassination spent a few days with grandparents to avoid the measles and kept asking my grandmother when they were going to put him in the hole, (nothing on tv for four days) .",1512691200,,640,4.264462809917355

8607716,3,B00EP10V68,"I've seen too many programs on the life and times of Pres. Kennedy to rate this one more than middling.

IMDb lists it as 1965, yet JOHN F. KENNEDY: YEARS OF LIGHTNING, DAY OF DRUMS may be from '64.

Narrated by Gregory Peck it's a 90 minute program that hasn't aged well.
For one, the music track is too intrusive, often overly loud and very repetitive.

It's caught up in mourning, as if the events of 11/22/62 had recently occurred.

The show's six sections, on the Peace Corp, Alliance for Progress, Civil Rights,
Space Race, Freedom and Peace are linked together by funeral footage.
The very last section, Peace, is mostly JFK home movies and clips from his 1963
Ireland visit, memories the president loved sharing with friends and family.

Mention is made of the missile crisis and Berlin Wall, but nothing is given on
the Bay of Pigs or other problem areas. The Freedom Riders are seen, yet
their violent run-in with Birmingham, AL. Jim Crow types isn't covered.
The several deaths in the service of Civil Rights receive no notice.

One thing I found interesting is that besides Vietnam, Kennedy sent military
""advisers"" into Thailand, near the Laotian border. Had never heard that before.

Lee Oswald is pronounced JFK's murderer with no equivocation.

Clearly, Years of Lightning is a reverent memorial to our fallen leader.
