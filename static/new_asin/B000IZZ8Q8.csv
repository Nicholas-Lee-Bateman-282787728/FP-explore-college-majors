2664505,5,B000IZZ8Q8,"This is a superb martial arts movie with a mix of modern day artistry and traditional settings. It certainly is Donnie Yen's best work I have seen so far. He is truly an action choreographer extraordinaire as it takes a lot of skill and talent to train two actors (Nicholas Tse and Shawn Yue) with no martial arts background to become action stars. A must see movie for all martial arts fans like me! The martial arts skills, stunts, special effects, with a matrix spin on it are just breath taking. The choice of the background music is great too! Even though the characters are based on a comic book, the story line has a traditional Chinese spin to it, with a deep meaning, which helps tie the movie together through the end. Nicolas Tse (aka the tiger) and Shawn Yue (aka turbo leopard) are great pics to compliment Donnie and the best part is where Donnie Yen (aka the dragon) came to the rescue at the end...you will have to watch it to find out how Donnie finished it in style. I like this movie better than SPL as Donnie gets to shine as the main star and action director. Donnie deserves all the credit this time in this movie, with his skillful and talented display of martial arts and his excellent action choreography. Hope there is more to come...",1163894400,3,1260,4.458874458874459
2664506,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"I saw this film a week ago, bought it as soon as it came out, and I have to say the movie surpassed my expectations.

 The film focuses on two brothers (Donnie Yen & Nicholas Tse) who went their path to find their destiny. One chose to stay in the ""Gate"", a school for martial arts, and one chose to leave to find his path, eventually found his way as part of a triad. At first, the two brothers found themselves on opposing sides, until as fate would have it, the brothers found themselves in a common goal along with a nunchaku swinging stranger to avenge their uncle's death,(the sensei of the Gate)aginst a self-proclaimed Master who wants to take over the triad.

 The action scenes are well-done. The cinematography is brilliant, and the screenplay was very good for one adapted from a comic book(DRAGON GATE HEROES). The gap between the beginning and the climax is a bit slow, and it sometimes felt that the two women (Xiao and Rosa)were only for eye-candy but thankfully their roles were redeemed when Xiao met Qui and Rosa(One of the hottest women on film)made a sacrifice for the heroes.

 The DVD from Deltamac IS AMAZING! (I'm not sure if it is the one sold in Amazon)Picture quality is clean and the DTS-ES audio shakes my living room.
 This film is recommended for Martial arts fantasy fans, although it is inferior to Donnie Yen's other classic, SPL(Killzone, U.S. title), it is very much worth a Watch.

2664526,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"For the past decade or so, the Hong Kong action industry has taken to refining its production methods to suit the tastes of audiences abroad. The classic period pieces and grainy action-comedies we used to identify the Orient's Hollywood with seem to be things of the past now, as contemporary and commercially slick productions pandering to international viewers have become the daily bread of the current generation of stars and filmmakers. When it comes to slick productions, few are slicker than the flashy martial arts pop fantasy that is ""Dragon Tiger Gate"", which is a great example of how far Hong Kong has come in terms of cinema and the distance it still has to go to achieve greatness on a casual level.

The story: half-brothers Dragon (Donnie Yen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man/dp/B003INBNXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man</a>) and Tiger (Nicholas Tse,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-and-Tide/dp/B00005LK99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time and Tide</a>) - heirs to their father's prestigious school of kung fu - are separated early in life but are inexplicably reunited when an evil gang leader (Yu Kang) threatens their respective families. Joined by a nunchaku expert hoping to study at the school (Shawn Yue,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Initial-D/dp/B000BY9VO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Initial D</a>), they must persevere the differences time has built between them to fight for their honor and legacy.

The movie earned action director Donnie a nomination at the Hong Kong Film Awards, and I agree that this recognition is richly deserved. Though the movie lifts certain stylistic liberties from films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Reloaded/dp/B0000AXE8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Reloaded</a>&nbsp;(i.e. a fighter taking on hordes of black-robed henchmen) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;(i.e. the overhead camerawork during the Japanese restaurant brawl), it still manages to feel new and sleek without skimping on substance. Surprisingly, I found myself more impressed by the onscreen work of pop stars Tse and Yue than real-life martial artist Yen: through admirable use of wires and spinning kicks, Nicholas flows through his initial fights like water and gives the impression that he's flying rather than being supported by cables, and while some of Shawn's moves with the nunchaku are likely performed by a double, most of it is clearly him and he puts on a show more mesmerizing than Bruce Lee's in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Death/dp/B00005BCKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Death</a>. While Donnie Yen's more grounded, no-nonsense style of fighting will likely appeal to some, he looks stiff and uncomfortable when on wires near the end of the picture. Disappointingly, the action suffers as a whole when the fights become less about martial arts than infusing the characters' moves with CGI effects to create battles a'la ""Dragon Ball Z"". This could potentially be cool when handled in moderation, but it's presented ad nauseum and the graphics falter at times, killing the mood.

Good guy director Wilson Yip and cinematographer Chiu-Lam Ko do a great job of making nearly every frame of the movie pretty enough to be a poster, but amazingly, the non-fighting portions of the movie retain their substance through strong emphasis on the story, which ends up being much more complex than my synopsis coveys. There's less of a central plot to ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" than there are numerous subplots and flashbacks, and while it's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>, these do come together with eventual evenness to give the film a thought-out, layered feel. The ambiguity of the main villain and a mysterious master who enhances the heroes' fighting techniques near the end of the movie (played by the writer of the comic this is based on) is debilitating, though, and I have to admit that the layout feels a bit uneven. Most of the action scenes take place during the first and last twenty minutes of the picture, and the dramatic segments inbetween might not hold enough intrigue for viewers who are just in it for the kung fu to remain interested.

I consider this to be one of the most defining pop epics of Hong Kong cinema: the teen idol stars, high production values, ongoing intrigue with computer graphics, and a general desire to look fresh and new seems to be what this specific industry is all about these days, and if its filmmakers are able to refine their techniques just a bit more, Hong Kong could easily overtake Hollywood once more in the action arena.",1290902400,,5004,6.093617021276596

2664542,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"Dragon Tiger Gate goes down easy.  It doesn't ask a lot (except in the middle) and delivers a pleasing visual aesthetic and plenty of action.

Here we have all the features of a typical Hong Kong martial arts film:  a school of Kung Fu caught up in the feuding between rival clans of gangsters, a conflicted lead with a true heart, an emphasis on action, and only the most rudimentary elements of plot, character, or theme.  The middle section plods along wearily connecting the dots of the story, but really, no one is watching this for the romance or the drama, and that's just as well because the script and the acting don't manage to evoke even a hint of empathy for its characters.

Where the film shines is in its sets, costuming, direction, and choreography.  There's probably not much here that hasn't been done before, except perhaps for the bird's eye view of a three-room fight, with the camera panning back and forth across the rooms and down the hallway, and in making the head gangster of Hong Kong a comic-book villain in a cape and mask who lives in castle-like fortress with suitably moody lighting.  The leads are coiffed and dressed in the androgynous style popular across East Asia, and hang out in trendy looking homes and neighborhoods.

See this one with your brain turned off, a beer in one hand, and the remote (for skipping through the middle chapters) in the other.

Donnie Yen's fans will not be disappointed. Great energetic moves! Nicholas Tse carrying the role of Tiger Wong quite well.

Welcome to the world of Dragon Tiger Gate, where that guy you accidentally just hit on because you thought it was a girl from behind... could kill you with one blow(punch that is folks... let's keep it clean here!).  Everything I just wrote above is A) completely true, and B) had me feeling that this movie couldn't possibly offer anything that I would actually enjoy watching for 90 or so minutes.  Well, thanks to excellent choreography by star Donnie Yen and ultra stylish direction from Wilson Yip(and the ability to put my brain on cruise control) the movie defiantly proved to be a good time.  Dragon Tiger Gate tells the story of two brothers who were seperated as youngsters due to divorce and the Gate, a martial arts academy that their father co-founded.  As they got older, Dragon(played by Yen) ended up on the wrong side of justice, while younger brother Tiger(played by Nicholas Tse) stayed true to the moral fortitude taught to him.  A chance encounter in a restaurant between the two after many years, sets things in motion for the rest of the film.  Based on a Chinese comic book, the movie, it's characters, and the plot will most likely leave viewers less versed in Asian cinema scratching their heads.  Still, if you like martial arts action then the movie should provide the goods... even if you don't completely comprehend the ""why's"" and ""how's"" of the proceedings.  The action itself really is very good, and offers a nice mix of more grounded fighting(including an awesome scene with Donnie using a bo against a three-section-staff and sai wielding pair of assassins) as well as some more over the top and special effects laden moments(the finale mostly).  The movie seems to be unfairly judged against director Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen's previous pairing SPL(aka Killzone here in the States).  True, this movie is far different in style and tone then that previous effort but I can't fault them for trying something unique and different... besides(and most importantly) they still deliver plenty of great action(no single fight compares to either Yen's battles with Wu Jing or Sammo Hung in SPL, however; overall their is more action in this film).  If you like action and can get by the overly stylized presentation, Dragon Tiger Gate isn't quite required viewing but is still more than worth a try.  Thankfully, Tai Seng has provided a very nice 2-disc special edition of the film that features a crisp and clear widescreen presentation as well as an English dub track and/or clean, visible subtitles(technically speaking, one of Tai Sengs best releases).  If nothing else, watching Dragon Tiger Gate will at least make you rethink poking fun at the guy who just got his hair frosted at the beauty salon... he may just spin kick you through a wall(but I'll still take that chance and mock him).",1203292800,35,3369,4.930973451327434
2664549,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"I like this new generation of martial films because the older ones got boring and cliche.  Although i hate high flying CGI crap but this is a bit more on-the-ground fighting.  It has a Matrix appeal because of the special effects such as the hard hitting punches or kicks that knocks the opponent through a wall or floor.  It is very fast-paced in action.  The storyline is great, especially the ""flashback"" scenes that gave it some depth.  Ususally kungfu films have alot more action and less substance but in this film it is balanced. Thank god it didn't have a storyline where the good guys have to save a kidnapped girl. I gave it four stars because it didn't get in depth with the supporting characters as i was hoping.  Overall, i rented it and bought it the same day and i don't regret it.",1200787200,2,796,4.455172413793103

2664551,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"DRAGON TIGER GATE is the 2nd collaboration of the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team (The 3rd being ""Flashpoint"" in 2007). After the huge success of  SPL(2005)(aka. Killzone), they reunite in 2006 to adapt the comic book (manga) ""Dragon Gate Heroes"". I haven't read the comic so I can only comment on the film based on how it was made and its entertainment value.

Synopsis partially derived from DVD back cover (Deltamac)
Tiger Wong (Nicholas Tse) unwittingly takes Lousha Death Plaque, a token decreed by the leader of the Lousha Gate, Shibumi, hence is ambushed by triad gangs. As fate has it, Dragon Wong (Donnie Yen), a bodyguard works for a triad boss, saves Tiger and discovers that Tiger is his brother. A wandering young man, Turbo Shek (Shawn Yue), who plays with nunchakus, meanwhile, befriends the brothers in the fierce fight. In the super power showdown and endless killings in the Jiang Hu, only these three back street boys can fight for justice in the community.

Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen once again proves that they have the savvy when it comes to shooting fight scenes. Sure, wires, CGI and even trampolines were used, but the fight sequences are nicely shot with the near-excellent  CGI-enhanced set designs and superb camera positioning that takes you right in the action. The film is adapted from a comic, so expect the usual righteous concepts, hard-hitting stylized martial arts with a touch of mysticism and very ""cool"" posturing (from Donnie Yen, mostly). There are plenty of extended action sequences; highlights include a very nicely shot fight scene in a Japanese restaurant where goons get tossed towards the camera. Sure, choreography is a bit exaggerated and is a step backward from the intense fights of SPL, it is based on a comic book so expect reality to take a back seat. There is a lot of power-to-pose with Donnie Yen wailing his arms, with wind blowing his hair to look ""cool"".  Donnie is being ""Donnie"" with his coolness. (I suppose). The lasting impression is how ""COOL"" Dragon looks, what can we say, the actor likes to look good.

The main weakness of the screenplay I suppose is that when there are no fights, it stops to a crawl. There are a lot of characters in the film, but the real interesting ones seemed to have gone unnoticed. Renowned actor Yuen Wah plays Wong Jianglong, the master of the ""Dragon Gates"" seemed to be underused; his encounter with Shibumi seemed a bit rushed and lacked emotional impact. There was a great opportunity to expand with a ""sensei-student"" subplot with Turbo's (Shawn Yue) cocky and pretentious character, when they agreed to spar and if Turbo proves his worth, Wong would teach him.  Wong effortlessly humbled him with a slipper. Tiger and Turbo's beginning friendship should have been developed more also. (Their playful sparring pitched some depth)
Rosa (Beautiful Li Xiao-ran)and Ma Xiaoling (Dong Gie) serve as lovely eye-candy as well as love interests for Dragon and Tiger respectively. The tragic love story between Rosa and Dragon are a nice touch and Ma Xiaoling's efforts to convince a master to heal Tiger's wounds express a lot of desperation and hopelessness that brighten the film's premise.

The final fight may be visually nice and entertaining, but the masked villain Shibumi seemed underwhelming. Sure, he can knock around wooden pillars and oversized punching bags, but the actor was a bit unconvincing with his stiff moves.  I'm sure the director had to rely on camera trickery with his fight sequences. Also, the storyline with Shibumi just wasn't very immersive or interesting; I guess he wasn't ""bad"" enough. The over-reaching plot and the usual canned emotion hamper the film's pace. Flashbacks may explain a lot but it feels pretty routine. I guess the motivation behind ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" is to deliver visually stunning fight sequences and on this note it does succeed!

I own the 2-disc Hong Kong release from Deltamac. The U.S. release I've heard is coming from Tai Seng. Keep your fingers crossed, Tai Seng usually bring mediocre dvd quality, hopefully this release will at least be on par with its re-mastered edition of ""Initial D"".
VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.35 Anamorhic Widescreen. Exceptional transfer from Deltamac! Sharp, crisp and clean with radiant colors and solid black levels.  5.1 Dolby/DTS-ES Cantonese track with English subs are very good. If you're equipped, utilize the DTS track, it is the way to go!

Final remarks:
Unfortunately, I cannot judge whether this film adaptation is faithful to its roots. I'm pretty sure that ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" will find an international audience, even those unfamiliar with the comic book.  The film may be far from perfect, but the CGI-enhanced martial arts did do a BETTER job than most Hollywood releases.
The Wilson Yip/Donnie Yen team once again proves that action is what they do best. Despite the occasional Donnie screen hubris and the occasional overlong drama between fights, the film does deliver a LOT of powerful kicks and punches complete with bone-crushing impact! At least, they know what their followers want.
RECOMMENDED! For action/martial arts junkies...(4 stars)",1191456000,10,5136,5.028235294117647
2664552,5,B000IZZ8Q8,The movie was very good to my expectations and the boxset is great!  3 bust statues and loaded with other stuff!  Worth the buy!!,1184630400,,129,4.333333333333333
2664553,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"Director Wilson Yip and martial action star Donnie Yen join forces again after their successful ""Kill Zone"" (also known as ""SPL"") for ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" based on the popular Hong-Kong comic books. Someone looking for the same things as ""Kill Zone"" would be disappointed for the new film does not try to hide the origin of its source materials, so the actions get less intense and the film's tone could hardly be called noir. Still ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" is hugely entertaining action film with such capable cast as Donnie Yen, Nicholas Tse, Shawn Yue and Jie Dong. Also great are the supporting actors including Kuan Tai Chen, veteran of Hong-Kong film industry since the days of Shaw Brothers in the 1970s.

I haven't read the original comics, but it is obvious that the story is condensed for film adaptation. The story about the two brothers Dragon Wong (Donnie Yen) and Tiger Wong (Nicholas Tse) is confusing at first, but please wait for the actions to begin, and once they start, the film certainly delivers.

Don't take anything too seriously here. The mayhems in restaurant with long-haired Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse battling the combatants of the crime syndicate are made for pure entertainment. Shawn Yue is Turbo Shek, wandering fighter wielding a pair of nunchaku. You'll see a dinner table flying like a saucer, a huge sandbag (actually, the biggest one in the world) dropping from up above, and our heroes high-kicking the villains without touching the ground, but all of them are meant to be like that, just to be enjoyed. The film also benefits from the rousing score by Kenji Kawai (Mamoru Oshii's ""Innocence"").

The film's middle section slows down, and as always, female roles are not the most impressive ones in ""Dragon Tiger Gate."" Even Jie Dong who was so good in ""Happy Times"" is not required to do much, and neither is beautiful Xiao Ran Li.

""Dragon Tiger Gate"" is not only an answer to Hollywood which produced ""Matrix"" series or its trendy comic book adaptation; it is also a unique blend of Donnie Yen's martial arts skills, Wilson Yip's stylish camera works and above-average special effects. Enjoy it.",1176595200,8,2131,4.862258953168044
2664554,5,B000IZZ8Q8,"This film was BOSS!!! Donnie Yen is truly a master at the choreographing of MA sequences and providing SOMETHING NEW. All of that is present in this outing but we have the added component of CGI used subtley to enhance the action. The camera work and art direction are drop dead gorgeous. The physical capabilities of the film's stars cannot be overstated. They really got down and dirty here and it was FIERCE! You can't NOT mention the music/sound, cinematography and art direction. That training sequence is BEAUTIFUL and scored for the Gods! I loved the little nods to the comics. There are frames that last fractions of a second but really create the action feel of a comic.

Still worth watching but more of a rental than a buy.,1174089600,,407,3.9876543209876543
2664556,4,B000IZZ8Q8,"I loved the teahouse fight scene.  The camera play was hilarious.  Throughout the movie, the aesthetic design of various scenes were quite impressive.

The only criticism I have for this movie is the heroes' hair.  I know, I have to keep reminding myself that they are all based on comic book characters, therefore they can all have exactly the same haircut along with names like ""Dragon,"" ""Tiger,"" & ""Turbo.""  But I could only take the suspension of disbelief so far.  It ended right at the hair.

One last gem: in the last fight scene there is one profile shot of ""Dragon"" as he extends his right arm & points at the Bad Guy.  His musculature was exceptional, even to my bodybuilder brother on the next couch.  In subsequent shots, it appeared that that was not Photoshopped.  Good game, Donnie.",1173312000,,797,4.669064748201439
