4719431,5,B005LAIGF0,this movie must be seen.  it is great! watch today! i watched this on a flight recently and it breaks my heart that it didn't receive a bigger theatrical release.,1337817600,8,162,4.4
4719432,5,B005LAIGF0,"I was fortunate enough to see this film recently at the West End Cinema in DC. Having read some of the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I found myself pleasantly taken with the movie. Yes, there are one or two digressions that could have been better integrated with the story (or, possibly, cut). Yes, the climactic scene could've stood some tweaks. And yes, between this and You Can Count on Me<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-Count-on-Me/dp/B00003CXQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can Count on Me</a>, I do prefer the latter. But this was still one of the best films I've seen in years! It is a mature work, and honest, and considered. The emotions and psychologies of the characters feel real and authentic. If you're looking for a light, generic popcorn movie, this film is not for you. But if you appreciate true to life drama with weightier themes that will challenge your preconceptions and stimulate your higher cognitive functions, Margaret is definitely worth watching.

An early scene, of the story's tragic inciting incident, was so brutal, so powerful, and so upsetting that I almost had to leave the theater. The main character's involvement in this scene means that she is forever changed, and it's to be expected that she will begin to ""act out"" as she struggles to recalibrate her life in tragedy's wake. You might not like, or agree with, everything she does, but she is fascinating to watch. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone sums it up best: ""Margaret, for all its flaws, is a film of rare beauty and shocking gravity.""

As a product note, the disc release includes both the theatrical version (on Blu-ray) and an extended cut (on DVD). From what I've read, it sounded like the director was pressured to cut the film down to less than 2 and a half hours for the theatrical release, so it will be particularly interesting to watch the extended version. Perhaps some of the film's loose threads will prove to be more interwoven after all.",1336089600,121,2018,5.020895522388059

4719477,4,B005LAIGF0,"Very interesting, especially for Lonergan fans.  Manchester was excellent.  I think ""You Can Count On Me"" is his best film.",1494460800,,123,5.1
4719478,5,B005LAIGF0,"First let me say this is a very good film. I say film and not movie because it truly is a cut above. It is filmed well, beautifully photographed with spacious views of New York City, stellar performances by all the participants, and with an amazing screenplay. A good story, expertly told.

Unfortunately, ... for anyone who has raised an adolescent girl with inner conflicts (the grand majority, LOL), this film will cause flashbacks.

The protagonist played by Anna Paquin is, like many adolescents, possessed of inner conflict and raging hormones. As a result, she says and does things without knowing why. And these inner conflicts show themselves in how she related to others. She lashes out to friends, her mother (who is also a basket case), her mothers boyfriend, her fellow students,  anyone within an earshot. She is an adolescent on a mission.

Watching this film is a worth-while experience, and it is a great film, all three hours of it. But as another reviewer has commented, which is all too true, don't watch it alone. It is a gloriously jarring experience.",1493164800,,1073,4.8469945355191255
4719479,5,B005LAIGF0,"Movies that reflect life's ambiguities and mixed motives (e.g. House of Sand and Fog, The Descendants) are among my favorites. This is one of those movies as well as being something of a coming of age story, another interest. Margaret's energy and youth gives the story life and ultimately optimism. I found the film fascinating and engaging, anyone looking for more traditional fare may well find it long and boring.",1490227200,,417,4.9714285714285715
4719480,2,B005LAIGF0,Really upsetting in so many ways. Too much to take in. Don't watch it alone.,1489795200,,76,4.133333333333334
4719481,5,B005LAIGF0,"Certainly not your typical Hollywood fare and thank goodness for that. This was a very complex, powerful, disturbing, poignant and naturalistic film. And I loved it. The film was rich in its characters and the storyline was intense throughout. Anna Paquin is magnificent, as were all the characters, but 'Margaret' probably is not for everyone.",1489622400,,344,5.2727272727272725

4719503,5,B005LAIGF0,"This movie has so many great things about it that I was completely under its spell. There was nothing to dissect or analyze because the films world was so well laid out, that there was never a burning need to question. I didn't feel any sense of fragmentation that other people have mentioned in their reviews. It's a great film and will stand the test of time. I thought particularly the sound editing was some of the most creative and energizing I have ever heard. Very effective mixes where we sometimes hear extraneous conversations that pepper and nest the main conversations in an interesting, relevant and vitalizing way. Reminded me of Altman's exploration of audio in the operating room scenes in Mash. This is a movie where everything means something. Nothing is done just for its own sake. This film is driven by a unifying vision. Wow. What a movie!",1487462400,3,861,4.746666666666667
4719504,1,B005LAIGF0,Horrible story. Awful character. Makes one not want to have kids. An ugly and depressiing film. I never want to see another film with girl!,1486166400,,139,4.6
4719505,4,B005LAIGF0,"Very well done movie.  Good casting, great script.  I found it upsetting - meaing it got through to me - I did not like feeling uncomfortable",1486166400,,141,4.384615384615385
4719506,5,B005LAIGF0,"I normally like tightly structured movies in which each storyline ends with some kind of resolution.  This movie doesn't entirely do that... but it also doesn't ignore the convention entirely. The main storyline does indeed resolve in a satisfying way (at least it satisfied me) but the interwoven storylines don't really.  They kind of get woven in for a bit, and then are allowed to flow back out of the story, unresolved but still affecting.  The result would be frustrating (and surely is, for many viewers) unless you are able to experience it as genuine reflection of the messy, frustrating and unfair... but still hopeful experience of life.  I found Lonnergan's portrayal of a young girl - a not particularly likable one, certainly - to be uncannily insightful and unflinching.  It is infused with a deep, sincere interest that is perhaps synonymous with love.  If you have, or ever have been, a self-absorbed, self-righteous, confused, angry, guilty, lonely, delusional adolescent girl, or if you've ever felt lost in an incomprehensible moral universe, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",1485302400,3,1128,5.103260869565218
4719507,5,B005LAIGF0,"Rambling and expansive, this was truly an epic, but acted and written rivetingly.",1485129600,,81,5.3076923076923075
4719508,2,B005LAIGF0,"The story turns on a tragic event involving teenage Margaret.  In the end the writing doesn't hold water in that she becomes fixated on resolving the wrong thing.  Peripheral actions and story lines seem uneven in how they support the center, and Margaret's ranting becomes woefully tedious.  If we are supposed to see in the end the growth that is needed here, it is too little too late.",1484697600,,388,4.676470588235294

Despite the current acclaim of Lonergan's work, and the reference to this work as a ""masterpiece"", there are obvious reasons why this movie was so difficult to release and caused so much controversy between the studio and Lonergan.

4719562,1,B005LAIGF0,"It definitely wasn't the earth shattering masterpiece of the other reviews. The acting was superb, the storyline predictable, and the pacing was excruciatingly slow (I watched the recommended directors cut). Yes, the emotional relationships between the characters seemed to be on point from the perspective of someone who never lived any of the female lives. The problem wasn't that they were false per se; the problem was that all of the female characters were exactly the same type of woman: whiney, bossy, a bit stupid, arrogant, confused, and somehow missing the full picture of their circumstances. The role of every male character was to illustrate how much patience one needs to have relationships with women. The moral question began at surface level and stayed there.",1481500800,2,776,5.216

4719577,3,B005LAIGF0,"Being a Kenneth Lonergan piece, it has its merits -- worthy scenes, admirable and involving performances and some memorable dialogue. There is also one indelible, pivotal scene involving a traffic accident that is almost worth the entire experience.  Nevertheless, I found the whole not worthy of its many parts.

4719644,5,B005LAIGF0,"As most of us learned in Introduction to Hi-Brow Film Review, ""this movie is not for everybody"". Once again, how true!
Even though many in today's Sodom and Gomorrah world can't get enough ""over-the-top"" have some respect for your parents and grandparents and don't force them to watch someone masturbating on screen, even though it be darkly lit. The moans are enough.
That's just one reason of several to screen this movie. If you're like me you'll be glad to watch it twice and otherwise you can have some tact and not traumatize the innocent.
I really enjoyed all of this, regrettably, ""Theatrical Version"", as on the Blu Ray version BUT I loved it and will seek the supposedly better extended cut because I really want to see it all again. Anna Paquin is very fun, and in this role more than ever and I love watching her ""censor"" the complaining typical Anti-American voice. Rare!
Prepare for something other than complacency and DON'T just plop down in mixed company and expect good old-fashioned entertainment.
There are movies that unlock certain places, maybe in the heart, and allow for some therapeutic feelings. This is one.",1475539200,2,1136,4.860824742268041

4719646,1,B005LAIGF0,"Flimsy storyline and overacting by Anna Paquin. (And a thoroughly unlikeable character without redemption.) Also, odd uses of a cast including Matt Damon who acts like he's on overprescribed Xanax and Mathew Broderick who seems like he showed up for the wrong movie but took the part any way. Mark Ruffalo plays Mark Ruffalo like he does in every movie.

4719681,3,B005LAIGF0,"Anna Paquin plays Lisa, a high-school student in NYC who inadvertently causes a tragic bus accident in which the victim dies in her arms. She lies to the officer on the scene when she reports that the traffic light was green and that the victim had crossed against the light. She discusses it with her mom who asks her to consider what harm would be done to the bus driver and his family if she changed her report. For a while, she just tries to put it out of her mind but recurrent nightmares make her want to know more about the victim. She seeks out the victim's family and attempts to for  seek some form of accountability for the victim's death. Meanwhile, we get glimpses into her adolescent life where she knows that she is entitled and engages in vehement debates with her classmates about race and politics. She experiments with drugs and decides very deliberately to lose her virginity. She's constantly battling or insulting her mother, treats her younger brother with disdain, and is generally not an entirely likable character - self-absorbed to a fault. She befriends the victim's best friend, and becomes intent on achieving some retribution for the horrible death that she played a part in.

There are other subplots including her mother's developing relationship with a Middle Eastern man, her long-distance phone relationship with her father, and her relationship with one of her teachers. Two of these three subplots could probably be eliminated with no harm to the narrative. She is bright and opinionated and even a bit manipulative, but at some point you just want her to back off and not be so intense! The final scene at the opera is beautifully filmed and emotive, and even if you tire of the movie earlier, just fast forward to the final 10 minutes for this sumptuous performance.",1444176000,2,1806,4.785256410256411

Margaret is a tale of a 17-year-old's grief; and a tale of the misplaced moral passion of an selfish teenager; and a tale of a broken mother-daughter relationship; and a tale of America's post-9/11 grief; and a story of New York, a city full of people every one of whom has their own story and doesn't care about yours.  To that last point, there are at least 8 different characters in Margaret who are living breathing people with their own stories.  It's been years since I've seen a movie this striking.

4719714,4,B005LAIGF0,"This is a heavily promoted indie film that never made it.  It is the story of a struggling young lady in NYC.  Her parents are divorced and self-absorbed, if loving and occasionally there for her.  She is beautiful, intelligent, and questioning, appropriate to her age.  Then, a trivial incident leads to a tragedy for which she feels responsible.  The rest of the movie - nearly 3 hours in the extended version, which is what I am reviewing here - is how she deals with it, thinking in turn and then acting out.  At turns, it is moving, brutal, sad, funny, uplifting, pathetic, and promising; the other characters emerge and form a portrait of the Manhattan middle class.

I wish I could say I found it as masterful and brilliant as many critics have done, but I thought it disjointed, abrupt, full of trivia and incidents that appear meaningless or ill-fitting.  In most cases, it distracted rather than added to some vision or whole.  The film technique - to include random conversations or expressions - felt intrusive to me, irritating.

Nonetheless, the acting is truly wonderful.  Paquin creates a realistic, indeed brilliant, portrait of the girl - I completely believed how she grew and evolved as the crisis unfolded.  And she does transform herself, to a degree, though in so many ways, she is still a girl.  Most of the other actors appear in cameos, often to make some point, which works about half of the time, but also often fails.

I would recommend this film.  The ambiguities and lack of simple clarity are truly artful.  But it is flawed.",1409788800,11,1557,4.732342007434944

4719770,5,B005LAIGF0,"In college, my film professor once compared experiencing great works of art, whether literature, music, or film, to becoming closer to God. We, as individuals, go through life forging our own sense of morality and the Truth, so our organic connection to works of art we feel reflect this Truth is in fact a spiritual one.

Theres few films I consider meeting this profound, ambitious criteria, but Margaret sure does. It is the effortless, exquisite coming of age story of a high school girl, Lisa Cohen, becoming a young woman after witnessing and playing a role in a devastating tragedy.

I say effortless ironically, because this film is anything but; clocking in at nearly three hours (over three if you're watching the Directors Cut), this epic tale about one girl seems to encompass all of New York, if not all of humanity. Shots of Lisa riding alone in a taxicab pan out to a cityscape filled with solo cabs, together alone in the streets.

Anna Paquins incredible turn as Lisa is anything but effortless as well; she is this movie, pulling us in with her fiery passion, pathetic naivete, and devastating heartbreak. How she got through 2012 without earning a Best Actress Academy Award (let alone a nomination) is truly beyond me. Her performance is one most actresses could only ever hope to achieve.

What does feel so authentic and effortless about this film, however, is its change-over-time plot and the way characters respond to one another. An interesting development to observe is Lisas mothers acting career, and how each performance brings her more bows, more applause, more standing ovations.

One of the films more compelling themes, Lisas self-dramatization of the tragedy onto herself, is well fleshed out through the scenic design; we are experiencing the story through her eyes, but not exactly the world. The caricature adults and peers she encounters are in fully developed, believable worlds, from her math teacher who sublets his unit to the organically messy police department. These spaces all feel real, and the more locations we visit, the more we buy the world presented to us.

Margaret's most outstanding aspect, though, is its ability to create moments of high drama without grazing exploitation. This is not a film for the lighthearted, with its emotionally wrecking scenes and darker underlying subtexts. The institutional weaknesses of society are hard enough to live with as an adult, least of all through the eyes of a passionate youth. Margaret is a true masterpiece of youth cinema, as both an empowering testament to young naivete and a sometimes-necessary reality check.",1405987200,,2615,5.05568445475638

(Excerpts from my blog: Critic After Dark)

It's opera; you can tell that it's been written, shot and scored like opera, has the breadth, depth, scale of opera.

Again and again stories intrude--before Lisa can arrive at a police station to submit an accident report we hear an officer describing a married man's second wife and family, hidden away in Staten Island; Lisa's mother Joan (the amazing J. Smith-Cameron, Lonergan's wife) stars in a play and we hear brief snatches, sense a fully formed story being told (even if Lonergan has yet to actually write it out the play feels fully formed); later we learn that the late Monica had relatives with whom she never talked, and the story behind that sounds like another interesting subplot. Lonergan like Robert Altman before him and Jean Renoir before him seems to have mastered the (Catholic?) knack of giving us a world swarming with people, each worthy of our notice, the film frame at best an arbitrary boundary imposed to keep our attention limited to a reasonable span.

For a film with such wayward focus the (ostensibly) main characters feel alive, perhaps because (like Lonergan's multiple storylines) their defining boundaries aren't fully established, their personalities less than complete--they're still developing onscreen, and our responses change accordingly.

In my book the best American film of the past five years--if there's better, I can't think of the title at the moment.",1404432000,3,1661,5.681451612903226

4719775,2,B005LAIGF0,"I had high expectations going into ""Margaret"" because I really liked Kenneth Lonergan's previous film, You Can Count On Me very much. But this one didn't strike a chord with me no matter how intriguing certain relationships or characters seemed at first sight.
Anna Paquin gives a strange (and off-key) performance as Lisa, a high schooler who deals with a traumatic event that she basically caused. The film takes on too much and gives secondary characters who don't ultimately matter to the tale at hand way too much involvement. Maybe that's the point, to give a panaromic view --- but it's been done much better (namely, Atom Egoyan's icy masterpiece The Sweet Hereafter). I also feel that Lonergan mashed up so many elements of other films and seemed to want to either make tribute to them but the problem is that his own original work doesn't hold up. Sadly, I began intrigued but by the middle I was just very bored. I can't even imagine attempting the extended version.",1397692800,3,977,4.78698224852071

In the U.S. (unlike in much of the rest of the world), the ""theatrical cut"" is far more commonly available, especially on DVD (blu-ray isn't quite so difficult, although you still need to pay attention). Don't even bother with the ""theatrical cut"" though. Go directly to the ""extended cut"". Who would have thought a few minutes of additional footage and a remixed soundtrack would make so much difference? It's like two completely different movies!

None of the reviews I read indicated what I found most horrifying: she focused blame entirely on the adult involved and did not share or accept her culpability, her self-centeredness.  At 17 she is not too young to understand her contribution to the tragedy, but that is sublimated to her effort to ""seek justice"" by ruining the adult.

4719840,5,B005LAIGF0,"Like some of the other reviewers, I wish to focus on the difference between the two versions of the film, rather than offer a review of the film(s) itself.  The former seems a more valuable undertaking, at this point.

The Theatrical Release (TR), which I saw in the cinema during its brief (and cosmically delayed) run, struck me as a film of enormous power.  I expected that the Extended Cut (EC) would be an even greater picture, for it would rectify the only significant flaw I felt to be in the TR--namely, the abrupt and semi-arbitrary nature of some key scenes, particularly in the final third.  These flaws I did not attribute to the extraordinarily gifted Lonergan, but to the seemingly draconian measures taken by his studio overseers in the production process.

What I encountered in recently watching the EC, however, was not the same film with additional scenes (though they were there), but a film with a much different feel.  Still very impressive, to be sure, but not, for me, nearly so affecting.  Others have commented on the significantly different soundtrack and scoring in the EC; and that, to me, is the core of the disparity between the two.  The inclusion of background or secondary conversations and other incidental sounds in the EC is much more pronounced--overly so, in my view.  Where their moderate use lends the TR a richness and a scope (a feel for New York, and even life itself, in all its density and variety), they become distracting and showy in the EC, breaking up the rhythm of the film and our ability to engage with the more central action and characters.

Even more noticeable is the difference in how the two films are scored.  The TR contains a mix of well-known classical and opera music, as well as some incredible original work (I think) from the composer Nico Muhly.  All of these pieces, as well as the timing and duration of their use, feel utterly perfect every time I watch the TR.  They are instrumental, so to speak, in endowing the film with some of its great power.  But--and others have focused on this as well--the scoring in the EC is vastly different.  The original Muhly score, which fits (and creates) the moods of the TR so wonderfully, is altogether absent (I believe) from the EC.  In its place is either no music, or classical pieces which do not, to my mind, seem to fit with what we are seeing or what we've been made to feel through the action.  I imagine Lonergan must have felt this way himself, which is why he made the changes for the TR; but I don't know the reasons (presumably legal) why the EC had to ""revert"" to what I assume was a previous version of the scoring for the film.  In any event, the film does change as a result, and not, I feel, for the better.  When I watched it, I still admired it (the acting, writing, cinematography, etc...is still the same, still marvelous)--but music (or its lack) is a key aspect of any film, and only in the TR does it complement and elevate the other components in such beautiful ways.

My advice, if you have not seen either version, is to watch the TR first, then turn to the EC for some ""informational"" filling-in (courtesy of the added scenes) which will help add clarity to the TR.  This may seem like bad advice.  Why watch a version which lacks important moments in the narrative if the version that contains them is at hand?  I think I can only answer that the first time you encounter this truly great film should be in its best flawed form: that which Lonergan managed to get into theaters.  In the future, if we are lucky, there will be a Director's Cut--which will hopefully combine the best of the TR, the EC, and whatever may be missing from both.",1389312000,3,3681,4.550834597875569
4719841,2,B005LAIGF0,"I guess, I must start out by saying, if yer gonna make a film and cast Jean Reno as a boring Columbian man, don't do it. It's distracting.
And, if yer gonna cast a handsome young guy as a New York City bus driver who lives in Bay Ridge Brooklyn, don't. It's science fiction.
OK, snarkiness aside, I just don't get this film. The girl obviously distracted the driver and he ran a red light and ran over a woman. Ok, so? She sets out to have the driver fired ?
On and on. Anna Paquin does not make a believable NY private school Jew. Alison Janny as the run over woman was also distracting.  And why oh why was Matt Damon cast at all?!

4719842,5,B005LAIGF0,"'Margaret' is a gem, a must see-film. This movie has something you'll seldom witness in cinema: lifelike dialogue. There's also brilliant acting all over the place, with Anna Paquin - playing Lisa, the movie's main character - towering `Oscar worthy' above evrybody else.

Soo much is captured in this beautiful 'coming of age' drama, soo much going on in and around 17 year old Lisa, making this film a veery worthwhile, irresistable watch and a rewarding mesmerizing experience, 149 minutes are over before you know it.

Also worth noting is that the film portrays New York in a special way. Filmed and situated in 2005 the film gives a certain feel of New York in the wake of 9/11. This atmosphere is underlined in several classroom scenes where Lisa and her classmates have heated political debates on terrorism.

I'm not going to recap the film's story or explaining once more the film's title, others here have done this well and extensively. What I like to discuss and talk about here is that there's two versions of 'Margaret': the 179 minute 'extended cut' and the 149 minute 'theatrical release'. Before I proceed, from here I like to make a distinction between the TR (theatrical release) and the EC (extended cut).

Having watched both versions of 'Margaret' several times I consider the TR a masterpiece, whereas I consider the EC a great film. All the 'extra scenes' in the EC are superfluous imo - except for one scene explaining the `financial' relationship between Monica and her niece Abigail. Monica is a middle aged woman who, in a haunting scene, dies in Lisa's arms on a street in Manhattan after run over by a bus. This fatal accident triggers Lisa's story in this film.

In overall composition, in pace and definitely in regard to the soundtrack (dialogue and music) the TR offers imo a far better and more satisfying result than the EC. Excellent in the TR is the sparse and intelligent use of composer Nico Muhly's soundtrack. However, in the EC Muhly's music is run over several times by excerpts of quite well known western classical music, breaking the movie's spell and atmosphere for me. The EC throws in music by Richard Strauss (Vier letzte Lieder), Richard Wagner (Lohengrin) and Ludwig van Beethoven (String Quartet No. 12) and that's just too much. Richard Strauss's `Beim Schlafengehen' (from his 'Vier letzte Lieder') no doubt refers to pain and loss caused by Monica's death, but for me it sounds too big and sumptuous for a film focusing on Lisa's adolescent life. The use of opera as background music - as also happens in the EC - doesn't appeal to me either: soo pretentious. While all these classical intrusions in the EC don't work for me, Muhly's wonderful music - as being used in the TR - sounds far less 'ambitious' and therefore works very well, in the right pace, keeping things in the right balance, just as it should. His music is not obtrusive or disturbing in any way and deals perfectly with the film's unfolding story.

Another example showing a big difference between the TR and the EC - due to the use of the soundtrack - is the movie's final scene: Lisa and her mother are in the opera theatre, attending Offenbach's 'The Tales of Hoffmann'. The closing of the film starts upon their return from the foyer to the auditorium to listen to the next act. While her mother is already seated, Lisa returns very late in the auditorium, the curtain is about to rise again. What the EC does in this scene is throwing background music over Lisa's long walk to her seat in the auditorium. Wrong decision, using background music there turns out to be a mistake, as it almost ruins what is about to follow: the climax of the film. Then take a look at the TR: here the scene works perfect and builds up to a wonderful cathartic ending of Lisa's story. Why? Well, the editors of the TR show wisdom and understand that the final (most touching) scene of the film only has full impact when there's NO music added during Lisa's return to her seat. What does the trick here is the postponing of music's arrival until a few moments later - the opera performed live in front of Lisa and her mother - to the effect that magic happens in the final moments of the film. The background music earlier in the scene in the EC is superfluous and - even worse - in regard to what follows a misfit. Adding background music during Lisa's return to her seat puts 'drama' in the wrong place: too early, too soon. Watch both versions and experience the difference.

Whether you agree or disagree with me, you have to keep in mind there's a huge difference in the way noise, dialogue and music are handled in both versions. Therefore the TR and the EC have a very different feel, due mainly to a very different use of the soundtrack.

It turns out once more that cutting/editing a movie is a sophisticated art and that choices concerning the soundtrack have huge consequences. In my opinion the people who cut the TR definitely know and feel far better how drama works and how sound and image can interact in the best way. I'm aware of the fact that there's a great many critics who don't share my view and prefer the EC. Well, I think they're wrong and I can perfectly explain and defend my view. Watch both versions of 'Margaret' and you'll see what I mean when I talk about the importance and the impact of the soundtrack.

My final verdict: the 179 minute EC of 'Margaret' is - despite its flaws, I mentioned a few here - still a great film, but the 149 minute TR really works wonders - in der Beschrnkung zeigt sich der Meister! - and is the one you really should go for as it's an enthralling (5 star) cinematic masterpiece!",1388707200,2,5653,4.600198412698413

4719844,5,B005LAIGF0,"I saw Kenneth Lonergan's second film Margaret in New York City with a friend of mine at a small indie theater in January, 2012 and I was beyond surprised by it. It's very rare these days that I see a current film that is so powerful and haunting that I don't know what to make of it or how to take it in. Lonergan made the film in 2005 and it was scheduled to be released in 2007 but because of post production problems which resulted in a few lawsuits, it finally saw a small release in 2011 with very few theaters showing it. If things had worked out differently, this could have been a huge contender during award season. A film that deals with so many heavy themes and one that's very emotionally intense, I honestly don't know how to recommend this to someone. Not since Barry Lyndon (1975) have I seen something that has moved me this much. Anna Paquin has never been better than she is here. The performances are very real and the dialogue so authentic that it's overwhelming. Although it does have a few notable flaws, this is the best cinematic art of the past couple of years in my book and Lonergan being the most under appreciated contemporary director.

4719868,5,B005LAIGF0,"I finally got around to watching the extended director's cut (at 3 three hours) of this 2006 film that was finally released theatrically in 2011 and for home theater at the end of last year.  Wow, I was mesmerized by this unexpectedly compelling -- almost operatic -- story of a 17-year-old New York City high-school student (Anna Paquin) who believes she has unintentionally caused a traffic accident that killed a woman.

Her desire to set things right is met with opposition at every step. Torn apart by guilt and frustration that justice is an increasingly distant option, she punishes herself with self-loathing and hurts those around her as she realizes the real world of adults is a nebulous place where doing what's right is a foggy ideal seldom clearly defined.

Margaret is not a character in the movie but rather a reference in Gerard Manley Hopkins 1888 poem ""Spring and Fall."" Hopkins asks: ""Margaret, are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?"" and then answers at poem's end ""...It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for.""

The theatrical release has a running time of 150 minutes and it's the Blu-ray disc on the combo pack.  The far superior, more richly detailed and moody director's cut is 180 minutes and is on the DVD.  But it's the latter that seems shorter.  The superb supporting cast includes: Matthew Broderick, Matt Damon, Jean Reno, Allison Janney, and Mark Ruffalo among others.

4719954,4,B005LAIGF0,"Margaret is a film about  a young woman (Lisa), living in NYC, who attends private high school.  She is child of intellectuals and is at the age when she is aware of her sexual appeal to men.  Her parents are divorced and her father lives on the West Coast.  Her mother is a Broadway actress, which means that Lisa and her younger brother get to spend a lot of time on their own when their mother is rehearsing or performing.

Lisa is not a problem kid, she is curious about the adolosence and not quite sure how to deal with it since there is no one (no adult) available to talk to her about it.  One day, Lisa's action of distracting a bus driver ends in tragedy - a woman gets killed crossing pedestrian when driver runs the red light.  Lisa realizes she is a partial reason for what happened but does not acknowledge that right away to herself, her parents and police investigators of the accident.  As expected, our unconscious mind has a way of catching up with us in the most unopportune times.  Suddently, Lisa starts neglecting her schoolwork, she is irritable when dealing with her mother and school friends and she attempts to dull her emotional pain by having sex with her high school mate and later on her geometry teacher.  Needless to say, such escape(s) bring Lisa no relief - as a matter of fact, it only brings her additional problems.

Perhaps Lisa is spoilt, perhaps her view of right and wrong is a little confusing to her (do not forget that she is only a teenager and she is quite impulsive), but eventually her grief over what happened during the bus accident catches up with her.  Lisa's life is changed forever and she ultimately grows up overnight.

This is a complex movie, perhaps more suited for stage than film.  However, it kept my attention from start to finish.  I particularly liked the film ending.

4720024,5,B005LAIGF0,"As a child on a family trip in the 1970s, I saw a motorcycle speed past with a teenage couple. A car was making a u-turn and the motorcycle slammed into it, the teenagers taking flight onto the cement. I screamed and my parents stopped to assist the pair, who were sitting on the road, faces and jeans covered in blood. The kids were fine, but I have never forgotten the traumatic scene. I was reminded of this when watching ""Margaret,"" Kenneth Lonergan's epic 2011 film, as seemingly out of nowhere a similar incident takes place on the streets of New York City. One of life's mysteries is the unexpected emergence of tragedy, appearing as rapidly as the funnel of a tornado. Sometimes no one is to blame, a terrible truth difficult to grasp.

When viewing ""Margaret"" for the first time, I was fortunate to have no preconceived notions. Its unique structure created a rare sensation of being unable to predict the outcome. This is a brilliant masterpiece, audacious and deeply inspired. Longeran, the writer and director, has dared to be great with the kind of project reminiscent of filmmakers of the 1970s. As I later learned, ""Margaret"" was filmed in 2004, but Lonergan became obsessed in the editing room, unable to achieve a final cut. Lonergan was trapped by a maddening vision in the great tradition of Sam Peckinpah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Major-Dundee/dp/B001JJ11VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Major Dundee</a>), Francis Ford Coppola (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now-HD/dp/B008Y5FNL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now [HD</a>]) and Werner Herzog (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>). Such a quest produces the kind of art ""Margaret"" represents. Ahab goes after a whale. Herzog transports a boat. Lonergan, an unlikely existential madman, goes after life's meaning in post-911 New York.

Okay, so this film remained in hiatus for years, finally reaching theaters in 2011. I knew none of this when viewing it, and was stunned by unexpected greatness. Lonergan's previous film was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-Count-On-Me/dp/B000I9W2M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can Count On Me</a>, a wonderfully-acted independent drama perhaps a tad overrated. And then came ""Margaret,"" and Lonergan may well have destroyed his career. No matter, this film plays like Chekhov, a visionary work with many questions and few answers. I'm amazed by the negative reviews and realize critics were aware of the film's troubled background. Luckily, I was blissfully ignorant.

In one of the great performances, Anna Pacquin plays Lisa Cohen, a budding high school teenager who fatefully witnesses urban tragedy. She represses the trauma and for the remainder of the 150-minute film (another version runs three hours) she attempts to come to terms with its deadly consequences. The trauma festers, bubbling to the surface in fits of anguish. Pacquin's character, tortured by guilt, wants to do the right thing even if there is no clear answer as to what is ""right."" Lonergan is perhaps creating a parable for the New York terrorist attacks, followed by America's war with Iraq, or viewers can take it for something else -- a coddled though clever New York teen in serious need of therapy.

But the film is so well made, I'm of the belief Lonergan was on to something. Perhaps one of the hard truths of life is our own insignificance within the universe, where unexpected tragedy can strike at any time. We have no power over such occurrences, and justice oftentimes does not exist. Once such a truth is realized, have we lost the innocence of childhood? If this sounds like a brooding novel, that's because ""Margaret"" plays like one.

It's difficult to categorize this drama, but I was reminded of the works of Michael Haneke (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Michael-Haneke-Collection-The-Piano-Teacher-Funny-Games-Code-Unknown-The-Castle-Benny-s-Video-The-Seventh-Continent-71-Fragments-of-a-Chronology-of-Chance-7pc/dp/B000SIWHAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Michael Haneke Collection (The Piano Teacher/Funny Games/Code Unknown/The Castle/Benny's Video/The Seventh Continent/71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance) (7pc)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Ribbon-Blu-ray/dp/B00386OWUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Ribbon [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cache-Hidden/dp/B007R5JCNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cache (Hidden)</a>). One of our greatest living directors by way of Austria, his morose films never follow convenient paths, with shocking violence erupting at unexpected moments. His thought-provoking dramas are as unsettling as a Droog humming Beethoven. Lonergan has dared to tread similar turf.

""Margaret"" is supported by an extraordinary ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, Matt Damon, Matthew Broderick, Kieran Culkin and Rosemarie DeWitt, each with crucial moments providing layers to this complicated film. An added note must be made about the performances of J. Smith Cameron, as Lisa's mother, and Jeannie Berlin, as an elder friend who becomes Lisa's uneasy confidante. These essentially unknown actresses give searing portrayals in difficult, unwieldy roles. Lonergan's film shocked me, not just because of its emotional truth, but because of its tenacious refusal to follow any kind of convention common in films today.

4720028,5,B005LAIGF0,"Disclaimer: This is a review of the extended version which I recommend. Many negative reviews seem to relate to the theatrical version which was shortened making the relevance of some of the material difficult to ascertain. This review is my opinion and may in no way relate to situations or events real or imagined.

In Margaret, Keith Lonegran has produced a masterpiece. I was captivated by this film from start to finish. Lonegran's film is nothing less than symphonic in its harmonization of the milieu, the story, the cast, the score, operatic scenes, poetic and literary references, brilliant cinematography, and random bits of overheard conversations into what almost amounts to a musical arrangement.  Margaret is a complicated rendering of a seemingly simple story line into a timeless tale of humanity's foibles. Cut in the mold of a Shakespearean tragedy but much more accessible in the vernacular, Lonegran's tale turns on the drama following a heady self absorbed 17 year old, Lisa (Anna Paquin) who is dealing with her complicity in a horrific, graphically detailed accident that took a woman's life all the while attending private school and trying to deal with her parents divorce post 9-11 on New York's upper west side. The tidal wave of emotion unleashed builds with intensity until a literal crescendo set to the barcarolle opera number ""Belle nuit,  nuit d'amour"" that almost magically binds the viewer to the characters, the audience at the Met, and the opera cast themselves.

Some might wrongly conclude that the ball got rolling on the action in the film when the accident happened, but that would be a superficial examination, for as in Shakespeare a tragedy early in a drama often serves only to ignite a fuse that burns slowly and tortuously to a powder keg of misery implanted in the center of the characters lives years prior. This is a story whose seeds were sown in the persona's and affectatious universe of Lisa's now divorced parents and the repressed turmoil of the fractured lives left in the wake of their separation.

Naturally some will not have the patience for it and some will not see the point. Some will love it and some will be downright outraged. When you read the reviews you will see this to be true. The irony of the reviews for the film are that they serve as proofs of the things the film is trying to get at: people are different, they like different things, they can go berserk on trivialities, they can be quite strident when expressing their own views and they often view their interpretation to be the correct one, and they don't mind telling you, oh and they make mistakes and don't pay attention, a lot.

Margaret is unlike most films in that it really makes the viewer work to get a handle on what it's all about. It hides it light under a bushel so to speak. Firstly, the title Margaret comes from a poem by Gerald Manly Hopkins which is read in a classroom scene and whose theme is the hinge on which the action swings, that being misperceived sorrow. Secondly, there's an excerpt from King Lear that is brilliantly placed in another classroom sequence which bears a direct relation to the work's central thematic elements; that of humankind's almost unfailing inability to accept responsibility for its own actions and to chalk up consequences to fate, and deeds to having no other options. Thirdly, there are two operas, Bellini's Norma and Offenbach's The Tale of Hoffman, which should be watched before viewing. And lastly, you really can't take your eyes off the screen for most of the production because every angle and perspective of the camera bolsters and almost every snippet of dialogue underscores the main themes.

If you are looking for a ""When Harry Met Sally"" ""Speed"" or ""Laura Croft Tomb Raider"" you might be disappointed as it's not that kind of film. Not that it isn't riveting, it is. And not that it doesn't have a lot of action, it does. It's just an unconventional kind of riveting action, definitely not the typical Hollywood script. In the end we see the characters laid bare and their schemes and manipulations exposed. That's the ending. In that respect Margaret plays more like a European film than an American one. And that's fine with me. I loved it.",1356825600,14,4243,4.820054945054945
4720029,5,B005LAIGF0,"I thought this film pictured the most realistic portrayal of an accidental death scene I've ever seen.

Mark Ruffalo always delivers a fine performance.  I also liked the mother/daughter scenes.  Not always a bed of roses but the mother tried and both actresses played the scenes quite well. Paquin is always good but this is just an extension of her Frankie Adams in the TV adaptation of MEMBER OF THE WEDDING with Alfre Woodard.

""Margaret"" plays like a good modern novel. The acting, script, and cinematography are incredibly realistic, and the story is intelligently presented without being overly artsy or high-brow.

My take on it: After witnessing and being an unwitting participant in a tragic bus accident, bright, promising, but very frenetic NYC high school senior Lisa Cohen finds it harder than ever to find connection with anyone around her. Ironically, this prevents her from understanding why everyone around her has the same problem. As she says herself during one of the numerous altercations with her rising Broadway actress mother, ""People don't relate to each other. . . They're totally disconnected.""

On this subject, there are a lot of people screaming at each other here, and they usually don't even recall how the screaming began. They always stop screaming before it gets really tiresome, but the fights are crucial to the theme of people just acting out with no attempt to understand or empathize. The very fine acting and dialogue prevent ""Margaret"" from descending into what it could have been: A hackneyed soap opera/New York melodrama of the sort we've seen plenty of times before.

I found Lisa harder and harder to take as the film progressed. Sometimes it seemed that she should be a little less of a selfish ""drama queen,"" but, again, this negative development may be deliberate on the part of the creators and helps pose the question of who's really crazy and who's really sane.

There is a slow, steady tension to this film, plenty of interesting stuff happens, and there are all kinds of meaningful subplots. It often seems to meander, but everything's relevant in the end. Yet, ""Margaret"" is driven more by its various themes than it is by plot or character. I like it because it's so different from most current films; in fact, it's the first recent film I've seen that I'll probably want to see again. Nevertheless, people who just want to be entertained without having to sit back and analyze what they're watching will probably not want to sit through 2.5 hours of this.",1351987200,7,2095,4.940340909090909

It's so rare that you see a movie--or read a novel, or see a play--with characters so complex; Lonergan never lets you totally side with one person or another but somehow finds a way to show how people are both good and bad, kind and cruel, etc. And I don't think I've ever seen the Molotov cocktail of teenage narcissism, cruelty, and vulnerability represented as well as it was in Margaret.

4720205,4,B005LAIGF0,"Kenneth Lonergan`s ""Margaret"" is a movie completely devoid of conventional thinking and cliches.  In fact, at any given moment, its characters are likely to do or say something that seems wholly out-of-character, counterintuitive and unexpected.  That may be off-putting to some who prefer a bit more predictability in their narratives, but it becomes a highly rewarding experience for those who don`t.

And no one is more inscrutable than Lisa, the movie's protagonist (the title, ""Margaret,"" comes from a character referred to in a poem). Trying to probe Lisa's motives for why she does what she does can be frustrating at times for the viewer (and that`s putting it mildly).  As played by ""True Blood's"" Anna Paquin, Lisa is a moody Manhattan teen who becomes even moodier after she inadvertently causes a fatal accident while flirting with a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo, in a truly compelling performance).  Trying to find a way to process her guilt, Lisa turns to various people in her life, including her harassed and harried actress mother (J. Smith-Cameron), her physically and emotionally distant father, an eccentric friend of the woman whose death she caused, the bus driver himself, a teacher she has a crush on (Matt Damon), a random sex partner, the police, and various lawyers who become involved in the legal proceedings surrounding the accident.  But every action she takes seems to make matters only more confused and complicated, till finally she seems to be lashing out at people with no real rhyme or reason for why she`s doing so.  But the strange sense of imbalance this causes is what gives the movie its verisimilitude, for we sense that this is indeed what life would be like for people caught up in a tragedy of this magnitude - a sort of random but cruel cosmic joke that no one could ever be expected to process in a neat and orderly fashion (as most movies on such subjects might be tempted to do).  Life and relationships are messy things, the filmmakers seem to be saying, and ""Margaret"" captures that truth with unerring precision.

Nothing in ""Margaret"" ever seems stage or planned, not the plot twists and certainly not the interactions among the characters.  The relationship between Lisa - a fairly typical teen who thinks she knows it all and looks with scoffing disdain on the adults who are all obviously too foolish to really know what's what - and her mother, who doesn't understand why she and her daughter have begun suddenly drifting apart, has the definite ring of truth about it. That goes for all the other relationships in the movie as well.  And, true to the code, the ending does not come in a box all neatly wrapped with a fancy bow on the top for the audience to take out of the theater with them. It's just a single moment caught in time, no more or no less definitive than any other moment in life.

Along with the fine writing and direction, excellent supporting performances by Kieran Culkin, Olivia Thirlby, Alison Janney and Jean Reno enhance and enrich the experience.",1350086400,3,3025,4.829787234042553
4720206,5,B005LAIGF0,"rite of passage: a young girl is coming of age,flirting and testing the waters with men to see how alluring one she be to them. the vast majority of us do not have terrible tragedies result from  these fledgling efforts. but what if you are the one who does have these results?  that is what this movie shows us with anna paquin as the girl.

she is the cause of this tragedy and cannot face that fact.  so she focusses instead on the man she was was flirting with who may be legally responsible. if she can get the law after him, she feels, then maybe justice can be done,  she could not pick a worse way of attempting to solve this problem. causation in the legal world bears no resemblance to her young adult sense of morality.

this film follows NO hollywood trite plot on the girl's quest.  this is not a thriller or a mystery.  this quandry unfolds with strict realism. it unfolds exactly as it would unfold in the real world. she learns what we all learn, that we are the sum of our actions and have to live with the gravest of those for the rest of our days, internally.

anna paquin is terrific in this film.  she has become as good an adult actress as she was a child actress. we are getting some terrific actresses who began acting as children.  to name just a few: jodie foster, natalie portman, scarlett johanssen, elizabeth taylor and anna paquin.  this used to be unheard of.  child actors just disappeared from the screen as they grew up.  not so any longer.

I really thought this was fine at the 2.5 hours and ADDING an additional half hour seems to me to be padding a work that clearly made its point in 2.5 hours, especially since this critic added that this extended material is about the mother's boyfriend (I would have cut what there was of him.)  if it bothers you not seeing the full 3 hours, then hunt for the dvd package which contains the 3 hour extended cut version. caveat: most movies are not meant to be 3 hours in length.  there are very few movies which are worth seeing which are 3 or more hours in length. usually all it means is that the director has not learned how to edit his movies.

In my opinion the issues showed, the flow was not there making the already LONG movie seem even longer.

It is achingly human and the relationships between the characters are fascinating. It is merciless but never unkind, brutally honest, and just when you think it can't reach any deeper it continues to uncover layers of human experience that hit the bone. All of the acting is breathtaking. Jeannie Berlin is astonishing, as are the incomparable J. Smith Cameron whose nuanced portrayal as the mother is pitch perfect and Anna Paquin, unforgettable and heart-wrenching as Lisa Cohen. Allison Janney's 10 minutes on screen were so powerful and agonizing to watch,  I had to watch it several times because it was so wrenching and I was just floored. She deserves an Academy Award--you know what? They all do. Kenneth Lonergan, said to be cranky, is a genius and I hope he is able to derive pleasure from his magnificent creation.

Definitely a New York art house film. It's the type of picture that leaves the critics (and wanna be critics) cheering and everyone one else leaving the theatre saying ""WTF?""

The other reviews will tell you the plot, so I won't waste your time with that repetitive nonsense. What I will tell you is that this film was in desperate need of an editor. It was Shakespeare that once said (as Polonius in Hamlet) that ""brevity is the soul of wit"". If that is the case, this is truly a very dim-wited picture. At 2 1/2 hours long, this could have been neatly trimmed to to an hour and 45 and been a much better product. Instead we are left with endless minutes of panoramic views of the New York skyline and of people walking down the street. For what!? The movie takes place in New York, I get that, next scene please. What makes matters even worse is that the film was actually over 3 hours long but Fox had to fight for 5 years to edit it down to 150 minutes. And no, Michael Cimino had nothing to do with its production.

To give to some cred, Ana Paquin did a superb job playing a spoiled, emotionally immature, narcissistic and frankly cruel teenager. Hard to believe she was 23 or so at the time of filming. And while the supporting cast did a fine job in displaying mostly dislikable people, their efforts were wasted in this muddy production. And this is AFTER, Fox Searchlight called in Martin Scorsese and others to edit down to 150 min during its 5 year legal limbo. Oy vey!",1346544000,7,1629,4.4630872483221475

4720330,5,B005LAIGF0,"Margaret is a remarkable and moving film, presenting a number of themes and plots, and using a complexity of methods to tell its story.  All kinds of performing arts are drawn on--theater, drama, poetry, opera, and music--as we follow the main character, played by Anna Paquin, through a series of emotional, complex, and always interesting relationships with her parents, friends, and others, following the film's opening, a bus accident that has to be the most wrenching five minutes I have ever seen on screen.  Paquin's character is on screen almost the entire film, in a remarkable performance that portrays an intelligent young person as at times immature/whining and at times mature/sensitive, often at the same time.  In addition to the opening scene, there are any number of memorable scenes and performances, most especially between Paquin and her teachers, her mother, the bus driver, and, most especially, the close friend of the victim.  Aside from everything else, the film captures an essence of New York street life, as random conversations are overheard and mingle with the story lines, to great effect.  Also memorable are several scenes of strident classroom political arguments, and also every scene involving Jean Reno, as Paquin's mother's new suitor.  At the center of the film is a scene where a teacher played by Matthew Broderick reads aloud the Hopkins poem which gives the film its name (""Margaret are you grieving..."").
Even at its relatively high price, I recommend the two-disc set.  This contains the lengthy theatrical release (150 mins.) on Bluray, plus a second disc containing the longer director's cut (180 mins.) on DVD.  I have watched both versions and found them both very moving.  The theatrical release truncates some of the plot points, and for that reason I prefer the longer version.  But, conversely, there is a sense in which the theatrical version gains some urgency as it nears its conclusion, and therefore both versions are worth watching.
As a final note, I will mention that a couple of key scenes take place during opera performances, and both scenes use extensive excerpts from their arias, showing great sensitivity to the power of music.",1346025600,9,2195,5.1232492997198875
4720331,3,B005LAIGF0,"This film is two and a half hours about an inmature and mean-spirited teenager called Lisa. I don't have a problem with the cinematography or the acting, which are very good (Ana Paquin's peformance alone is worth watching, thus the three stars); I just have a problem with the plot.

Paquin's character, Lisa, lies to the police about an accident that she is almost entirely to blame, and then she gets upset and does whatever she can to get Ruffalo, the bus driver, fired because she feels guilty for causing the accident. I don't mind watching films about such characters, but to make her look as if she has nothing but good intentions and trying to get the viewer to feel for her and understand her? That's just absurd. More absurd is when she goes to the police to change her statement, and the police instead of dismissing her for being not only a minor but a liar, pay attention to her all along and tell her they will see what they can do for her. Are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathize with Lisa? What kind of police department is this? She admitted she lie and then wants to tell the truth and the police don't even bother making her see what's wrong about this?

In addition, what's the deal with all the random and forced class discussions that have nothing to do with anything? Class discussions about September 11, the war in Irak, and the Nazi and the Jewish are thrown in to make the movie thought provoking despite the fact that none of this has anything to do with anything. Or I guess that the film is trying to make Lisa look as if she is somebody who cares about current events and history and has a brain and an opinion of her own. Or the writer is trying to compare Lisa's own guilty feelings and justification for her acts to those of people involved in WWII, the war in Irak and September 11. I don't know, whatever is the case, I found it random and forced. Without this, I probably would have liked the movie better.

There's also an array of characters that are far from being likable, and which makes you understand why Lisa is the way she is. Culkin taking her virginity, Reno's boring personality, Broderick feeling threatened by a student who has a brain, Lisa's self-absorbed and selfish parents, Monica's mildly deranged friend, the Mickey Mouse Law school young lawyer who seemed to have missed class that day to meet Lisa and Monica's friend at a coffee shop to talk about the trial, etc.

I only liked Monica's friend, for a moment, when she tells Lisa to stop thinking the world is a tragic play where she is the star and tells her to grow up and get out of her appartment. Finally, somebody showed to have some sense at least for a couple of minutes in the film.

Matt Damon's character being seduced by Lisa is the icing on the cake. After Lisa has sex with him, her math teacher, she approaches him when he is, I am assuming, with his girlfriend or another teacher, and tells them she just had an abortion, obviously hinting that the baby might have been Damon's and trying to get him in trouble. Of course, she didn't have any abortion, but this is good-spirited Lisa, once again, with her good intentions trying to sell sympathy while trying to get other people in trouble because she feels guilty. Again, are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathy for Lisa? She should've been run by the bus instead of Monica.

I repeat, if a movie about such a character is going to be done, don't try to sell sympathy for her. This movie is about Lisa, a detestable character that makes you end up loathing this film.",1345939200,2,3553,4.458461538461538
4720332,5,B005LAIGF0,"[Spoiler alert: Maybe you should watch the movie first, THEN read this.]

This is a great film about loss. Loss of life, loss of virginity, loss of youth, loss of innocence. But as Cormack McCarthy said, ""Beauty and loss are one,"" and there's a lot of beauty in this movie. It's title refers to a poem by Gerard Manly Hopkins, which is read by a teacher in one of the classroom scenes:

Margaret, are you grieving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Leaves, like the things of man, you
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
Ah! as the heart grows older
It will come to such sights colder
By & by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
And yet you wll weep & know why.
Now no matter, child, the name:
Sorrow's springs are the same.
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
What hart hard of, ghst gussed:
It is the blight man was born for,
It is Margaret you mourn for.

In another classroom scene there's a free-for-all political ""discussion"" in which one of the students says she thinks teenagers should run the world because their ideals haven't yet been jaded by experience and disillusion. In other words, their hearts have not grown colder. This is what the movie is about. Lisa can't accept Monica's death or her own guilt in causing it, and is struggling futilely in a grown-up world which doesn't care. Not until near the end, when Monica's death has been translated into a $350,000 lawsuit for the relatives who wanted nothing to do with her when she was alive, does Lisa stop blaming the bus driver alone. ""I KILLED HER!"" she shouts.

 Anna Paquin was 20 when the movie was shot in 2005, and she does an amazing job as the 17-year-old Lisa Cohen. The final scene takes place in the Metropolitan Opera, where Rene Flemming is singing the Barcarole from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann. The courtesan Giulietta (at the behest of a guy who has promised her a diamond) is seducing Hoffmann. ""Belle nuit,  nuit d'amour,"" she sings--

Beautiful night, oh night of love,
smile on our exhilaration,
Night sweeter than the day,
Oh beautiful night of love!

Time flees and does not return
bringing our tenderness
Far from this happy stay
Time flees without return....

But it's all a sham. Lisa has lost her virginity but has not had her night of love. Her life is beginning, her childhood is over, time flees and does not return. Finally, while Flemming sings, Lisa breaks down weeping in her mother's arms. But her grief is not just for Monica. As Hopkins wrote, ""Now no matter, child, the name:/Sorrow's springs are the same."" It is ourselves we mourn for.",1345852800,3,2570,4.606126914660831

4720428,4,B005LAIGF0,"Kenneth Lonergan's Margaret (2012): Just watched the 150 minute cut of this. I was reminded of several of Alexander Payne's films while watching, especially Election (1999). The two directors share a very similar moral vision: people are not as connected to each other (or as moral) as they might think, they tell stories so they feel connected to something (themselves maybe), but their stories just make them all the more aware of how isolated and compromised they really are. The films of both directors never end with any kind of resolution or redemption, they just end. I don't know that Lonergan is the more ambitious of the two, but he is certainly the more artsy (and by artsy I suppose I mean ambiguous). ""Margaret"" for instance is not the name of any character in the film, rather that is the name of a character in a Hopkins poem read aloud in an English class. The main character's name is Lisa, a high school senior, who experiences a traumatic event and becomes either a) so sensitive to the ongoing tragedies in the world around her that she ceases to think her own existence even matters, or, b) so callous that she cannot take pleasure in anything unless it inflicts harm upon others. Lisa switches back and forth between these extremes, sometimes in the course of single conversations. Its very difficult to say what the trauma has done to her or what kind of person Lisa is. You keep watching but its hard to know what to make of the character or the film. Even at 150 minutes, this still reads like the first chapter of a much longer work. This is solid filmmaking but ultimately unsatisfying because incomplete.",1344988800,2,1632,4.689895470383275

4720430,3,B005LAIGF0,"There is no one named Margaret in the movie. It comes from a poem that is read. But that's okay I grew up watching Captain Kangaroo who is nether a captain nor a kangaroo. In fact there may have been a lot of stuff I didn't grasp in this film, but here goes.

The film opens in slow motion to illustrate how life moves slowly along until one moment suddenly changes and defines it. Lisa (Anna Paquin) distracts a bus driver who runs a red light and kills a women. She wants to do the right thing, but what is it? The grief and moral dilemma disrupts her life and her relationships.

The film is well made. The acting was excellent as was the writing...I think. I just didn't enjoy the film, but I didn't dislike it either. The main problem I have with the overall theme is that Lisa wants justice for the dead woman. She has grief which we see, but we don't see her publicly confess her role in the death. She doesn't seem to have any guilt...or perhaps that is the point of the film is that we quickly forgive our own guilt...except we don't. I kept waiting for Lisa to take blame for what had happened.

This is a film about grief, but it is not really sad. Matt Damon plays a geometry teacher who is a love interest of Lisa. Matthew Broderick plays a literature teacher whose classes provide the film with multiple confusing deeper themes for you to pick from in case you don't like the aspect of simply dealing with grief.

4720431,5,B005LAIGF0,Comes with a BluRay and a DVD.  I watched only the DVD.  Product was exactly as advertised. Arrived in a timely fashion.  DVD version  is quite long but I knew this before purchase.  I think the film is one of the best I've seen in years.,1344816000,3,238,4.086956521739131
4720432,2,B005LAIGF0,"This unduly long film is sufficiently amorphous and thematically uncertain that it lends itself to a variety of interpretations.  I suspect that whoever edited it was as confused as I was as to what was going on and why some of the characters were inserted.  Yes, life is complex and defies easy summary in the form of a convenient narrative, but this movie takes off in too many directions with too little coherence to make it honestly interpretable as a cinematic whole.  Maybe if I had read Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem ""Margaret"" immediately before viewing this DVD by the same name I would have had a ready-made point of departure for making sense of some of it, but that really shouldn't be necessary.  ""Margaret"" the film should speak for itself a lot more clearly than it does.

Coming of age is painful, episodic, fraught with fits and starts, nonlinear, and unpredictable.  Sometimes it takes an horrific turn, assuring an unnaturally difficult maturation process, as with Lisa, ""Margaret's"" main character.  It seemed to me, however, that Lisa was never so willfully oblivious and callow that she needed this sort of brutally painful shock to jump-start her movement toward maturity.  She may have been a bit self-absorbed and arrogant, but her biography as we knew it seemed to assure that she had experienced her share of bumps, bruises, indifference, disappointment, and betrayal, and that a more privileged and insulated protagonist would have better filled her role.  Yes, she lived an upper middle class life in an upper middle class world, but whatever smugness she had left could have been remedied with something less destructive than post-traumatic stress disorder.  No, there are no guarantees that we'll get what we need and deserve, or what seems fitting, but scars inflicted on smooth skin seem more telling for the viewer than scars inflicted on scars.  Too much of the latter and we don't come of age, we simply fail to thrive at all.

Lisa's mother was portrayed very effectively by J. Cameron Smith, but she seemed as confused and unfinished as her daughter.  Lisa's father was a remote and determinedly ineffectual figure whose blandness made lack of affect seem like a dynamic phenomenon.  Her younger brother appeared on screen occasionally, but his character remained completely undeveloped, making one wonder why he was there.  Jean Reno's Colombian businessman, who courted Lisa's mother throughout most of the movie, seemed as inept and unconcerned as Lisa's father, making one wonder if her mother was somehow drawn to expressionless, self-centered bores.  Matt Damon and Matthew Broderick had thankless roles as more or less adequate teachers, though Broderick's inability to anticipate and handle out-of-the-ordinary student responses would puzzle anyone who has taught for even a few years -- it comes with the territory.  Jeannie Berlin does a great caricature of a middle-aged, single, Manhattan Jew with time on her hands.  New York is impersonal, drab, dirty, glitzy, cultured, cruel, and is given entirely too much cinematic attention.  We get it!  Enough!

Lisa is confused, disappointed, frustrated, seductive, guilt-ridden, naive, spoiled, an easy mark, awkward, attractive, obsessive, annoying, angry, troubled, destructive, and, I suppose, working toward adulthood.  Most people are most or all of these things at one time or another over the course of a lifetime.  But all in one film?  Anna Paquin is undeniably talented and does the best she can, but it's an awful lot to ask of one actor in one movie, especially when the script dictates a startlingly ambiguous and lame ending, one that suggests the author finally ran out of steam but made sure to do so in an obscure and pretentious fashion.

Life is hard.  It takes an act of bad faith to represent that fact in an histrionic, overwrought, idiosyncratically artsy and artificial way.  Maybe that's why thinking about this film makes me angry.",1344816000,5,3949,5.1201248049922
4720433,1,B005LAIGF0,Me and my husband did not even finish the movie... That's how bad it sucked. We will never watch it again. I wish I would know who rate that movie so high.....,1344816000,3,159,4.0
4720484,4,B005LAIGF0,"This was director Kenneth Lonergan second feature after a long break from the acclaimed ""You Can Count On Me"" from 2000.  He was also the writer and has the role of the father of the main character, Lisa (Anna Paquin).  The film was wrapped in 2005 but sat on the shelf when Lonergan and the studio couldn't agree on the final cut.  Lonergan started with a 4 hour version and whittled it down to 3 hours.  After years of legal wrangling, Martin Scorsese and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker were brought in to take a crack.  Lonergan had worked with Scorsese on ""Gangs of New York.""  The movie was finally released in late 2011 for a brief money losing run.

The Blu ray version I reviewed is 2 hours and 30 minutes, the same as the theatrical version but the package includes the 3 hour extended cut on a separate DVD, not Blu ray.  There are no extras on either disc.  The story is about a 17 year old ""rich Jewish girl"" played with an eye-opening performance by Paquin.  Love her or hate her, you won't forget her.  Out one day on the streets of NYC she spots a straw cowboy hat she wants.  The problem is that it sits on the head of a city bus driver (Mark Ruffalo).  Unable to get on the bus she chases him down the street waving for him to stop.  He thinks she's flirting so pays more attention to her than his driving and hits a pedestrian (Allison Janney).

In a gut wrenching and elongated scene at the accident, Monica (Janney) dies in Lisa's arms.  When questioned by the police, Lisa makes eye contact with the driver who is being questioned at the same time.  When asked whether the bus had a green or red light, both lie and say green.  Now here is an irrefutable major plot point that would seem to be easily dismissed.  On a busy city street there were no other witnesses?  No traffic cameras?

Putting that aside, Lisa's anguish and guilt spill over into her relationship with her mother, an actress in smallish theatrical productions.  She treats a potential boyfriend (John Gallagher Jr.) harshly, instead gives her virginity to a coke-snorting hot shot (Kieran Culkin).  In a social studies class Lisa engages in frequent debates with a Muslim sympathizer devolve into yelling matches that would make political talking heads proud.  In her English literature class one of her classmates goes on and on debating the teacher (Matthew Broderick) about what Shakespeare meant when writing one of his plays.  She flirts with her math teacher (Matt Damon).

Lonergan spends a lot of time inside high school classrooms, clearly indicating the film is about the teenagers' transition from childhood to adulthood and the difficulty of the journey.  It is in the English class that Broderick's character reads a poem by 19th century author Gerard Manley Hopkins entitled ""Spring and Fall: To A Young Child.""  The child's name was Margaret.  This is a favorite poem of Lonergan's, given to him by a mentor, Patricia Broderick who is also Matthew's mother.

As Lisa's guilt builds she tries to recant her original statement but is brushed off by the police (case is closed).  Frustrated she tracks down Monica's nearest relative, a cousin in Arizona who rarely spoke to her cousin.  Eventually she finds Monica's best friend, Emily played by Jeannie Berlin who hasn't been seen on the big screen since the 1970's (""The Heartbreak Kid"").  She is a real find and gives an award worth performance.  Emily is a perfect friend and foil for the still learning Lisa.  Together they form an alliance to bring a lawsuit to eventually get the bus driver fired.

For the first 90 minutes I was totally enthralled with this production, but then Lonergan keeps tossing small grenades into the fire.  Lisa's mother (J. Smith-Cameron in another strong performance) struggles with a relationship with a French businessman (Jean Reno).  Lisa's flirtation with her math teacher goes much too far.  Lonergan obviously has a lot on his mind and wants to get it all in, but he often loses his way.  The film is not very cohesive and at times frustrating and disorienting.  Still...I have to say, I had a hard time sleeping and continue to think about the film.  As much as I want to categorize it as a near miss, the more I think about it the more I yearn for that 4 hour version.

The Blu ray transfer is decent.  Admitedly I watched it on a smaller display than I usually use but I thought the film looked a little dark and soft.  It comes in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is just fine with a nice DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The sound is mostly upfront with occasional street sounds from the surrounds.  Diolog is clear and centered.",1344816000,4,4648,4.638480392156863

4720488,3,B005LAIGF0,"Spoilers! The acting was very good; so many scenes seemed very real to me. But too many  scenes also seemed totally pointless. Ramon's wake & son saying he'd wanted to marry the mother? (Ramon's whole business in the movie at all was tenuous at best.) The argument with a student about the intent in a line of Shakespeare's? The landscape scenes? (At one point it was so extended, we thought the movie might have ended.) These inconsequential scenes kept getting in the way of the movie instead of adding to it. The story itself is very compelling, but the addition of pointless scenes was annoying. I watched the 150-minute version. I keep wondering if the 186-minute version made those pointless scenes have meaning by somehow tying them into the plot. But I'm sure I'll never know, because I can't imagine ever wanting to spend that many minutes watching these little vignettes into someone's everyday life again.",1344211200,2,916,4.871794871794871

4720490,5,B005LAIGF0,"""Margaret"" was supposedly filmed 7-8 years ago, and for reasons I'm not sure of, sat on the shelf until finally a group of film critics advocated for its release. After watching it, I can understand why ... it's a difficult film, hard to categorize, but also rich, provocative and brilliant.

The superficial storyline of the film involves a 17 year old girl, Lisa (Anna Paquin, looking much more natural than she does now in her toned, blond TrueBlood persona) who is indirectly involved in a fatal accident in which a woman is killed by a bus. Confused and guilt-ridden, she goes about trying to do the ""right thing,"" which in her mind involves making sure those responsible (including herself) are held accountable, as well as trying to get justice for the deceased. But at every turn, her effort is met with the ambivalence, apathy, and bureaucracy of the adult world.

However, as much as the film follows this dramatic central storyline, the film is also a portrait of all the much more mundane and subtle predicaments of being 17 years old. Lisa is no longer a child, and no longer coddled like one. She is expected to behave like an adult, but at the same time the other adults in her life constantly remind her of her youth and inexperience at every turn. She's impulsive and emotional, but also insightful and self-aware. She also wants to explore and experiment, and is aware of the power of her youthful sexuality, but also quickly finds out the repercussions of it. Around her are the archetypes of the kind of people most of us probably had in our lives at her age: her mother who is equal parts self-absorbed, caring, and clingy; the goodhearted but awkward friend who wants to date her; the experienced bad boy who she finds much more interesting; the pathetic teacher who is more interested in holding onto his tiny source of hubris than exploring a student's genuine ideas; and sadly, the one well-meaning, compassionate adult in her life who she hurts just because she can.

Paquin's performance is formidable, and would probably be award-worthy if it wasn't so old. The film itself, by alternating between high drama and subtle character exploration, serves as one of the best depictions of modern adolescence I've seen. ""Margaret"" isn't a perfect film, but the fact that it's a flawed masterpiece might make it even more appealing.",1343865600,8,2352,4.816831683168317
4720491,5,B005LAIGF0,"I'm very happy that all the legal wrangling finally resolved, and that I got to see this.  I've always considered film to be a branch of literature that is not always looked upon with the same critical eye we are so used to with books.  For me, this film kicks it way up several notches in story, characters, actors, and filmography.

I found this film an amazing experience.  Just for starters, to me, Kenneth Lonergan eye seems like my own--he shows us Manhattan on camera the way I see Manhattan as I walk about. I wonder if this is true for others.  I found this camera work so accessible, and made me feel like I feel when I'm there going about my day.  This may sound bland, but, it was remarkable that it felt like me being there taking in the city on any given day.

The story then vividly portrays the chaos and angst of adolescence, family life, sex, relationships, tragedy, parenting, and the inevitable confrontation of the world as it works and human idealism.

The cast was impeccable, Anna Paquin showed us  a phenomenal display of craft, as did the rest.

I hope this film get's the recognition it deserves.

4720566,5,B005LAIGF0,"I highly recommend the movie ""Margaret"" directed by Kenneth Lonergan.

It's the second film Lonergan has both written and directed. You may remember his first film ""You Can Count On Me"" (2000).

Lonergan shot ""Margaret"" back in 2005 but it was never widely released due to a series of investor/producer legal squabbles and a contentious editing process where even Martin Scorsese was involved. Lonergan's own theatrical cut was finally released this month (July 2012) on DVD.

It's a gem of a movie and if you love New York and the performing arts it's an additional plus. The film is beautifully shot, the music is captivating and the acting is top notch. It has an amazing cast including Anna Paquin, Matt Damon, Mark Ruffalo, Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, J. Smith-Cameron, Allison Janney, Josh Hamilton and an amazing performance by Jeannie Berlin.

4720568,4,B005LAIGF0,"Basically this movie is about a teenage girl who plays a part in causing a grisly bus accident that kills a women.  The rest of the movie is spent showing how the girl deals with her guilt and confusion in various ways and how it impacts her decisions.  It does a good job of capturing that ""life goes on"" feel even when one is in the midst of horrible pain, guilt and indecision about how they should feel and what should they do.  It also shows how relationships can be impacted by a tragic event.  Margaret is ALOT of drama to take so be prepared.  The accident scene is extremely real and as close to what I might imagine an accident like that would really be like without hiding anything or sugar coating it.  Anna Paquin plays the snotty, intelligent, sometimes sweet, sometimes loving, distant, and overly-emotional teenage role to perfection.  One sometimes forgets that teenagers are all these things rolled into one and the complexity of that time in life is captured very well.  It also addresses teenage sexuality and the relationship between a divorced mother with a busy career raising her teenage daughter.  I really liked the reality, no-bs quality of Margaret.  Margaret tries to rectify what has happened but it's true that when something like that does happen, it just seems that whatever you are doing to try and help somehow isn't enough or you're just not sure what is the right thing to do.  Also swirling around the plot is a semi-legal drama about getting the bus driver fired which actually turns into something else that Anna Paquin's character was not expecting.  Admittedly at times I was annoyed with Paquin's aggressive, smart-aleckness and some of the drama was sort of corny, but all in all, this was a very different movie that was somewhat refreshing.  Dare I say something new here?  As most movies repeat old plots.  Bravo for Anna Paquin.  Once again, this is a HUGE dose of drama which might leave you feeling a little done with drama after you watch it - but that's okay. It's worth watching and experiencing something different for awhile.",1342828800,6,2080,4.7202216066482

And the fact that in the end nothing was even accomplished, the guy didn't even get fired, made it so much worse because there wasn't a ""end product"" that I could enjoy.

4720571,5,B005LAIGF0,"Margaret is a phenomenon as a film that suffered many set-backs in coming to release and suffered an embargo on distribution. Its a wonder we have a copy on DVD although it was released in a shorter version at some cinemas(2.5 hours) the extended version of 3 hours is available. The director Lonergan had one previous film,You Can Count on Me. The film does something remarkable; it dives into the emotional turmoil of a teenage angsty girl (Lisa) whose hormonal turbulence makes her react in an angry, startled ,self righteous manner, at every confrontation, conflict between her view of the world and the worlds reality. She challenges her mother with a kind of contemptuous indifference. Her mother is played by an excellent actress J.Smith-Cameron, who has more than enough of her own troubles, having divorced, and has a career as a stage actress. She also becomes absorbed in dating a South American(Reno),who introduces her to opera. We see Lisa in scenes at school in class, where she argues through every point with such raw emotion, whether about 9/11 or Palestinians, she sometimes has to leave the class. We also see her in scenes with her literature teacher( Mathew Broderick), with his somewhat smug, pedantic questioning of his class about Shakespeare or Gerard Manley Hopkins.

She treats a young man badly who cares for her a lot. She takes up with the school seducer, who introduces her to drugs, and helps her lose her virginity, without having any love for her. She also has an affair with her maths teacher ( Matt Damon : a beautifully understated performance). The central part of the film is based on her witnessing and contributing to a traffic accident by distracting the bus-driver, by waiving at him alongside the bus. She holds the hand of the dying woman, who mistakes her for her daughter. Her guilt about the accident makes her pursue the case and contact the womans family as well as the bus driver ( Ruffalo), in another explosive scene. There are many situations when Lisa is on the phone(when music is played by her brother in a neighbouring room), or shes talking to her father( Lonergan) who is in California, in conversations that are hopeful about meeting, but don't go anywhere. In cafes we approach her talking but we also hear the other customers talking too. The deceased womans friend( Jeannie Berlin) has a coruscating scene where she attacks Lisas narcissistic abrogation of other peoples lives and grief for her own self-dramatizing ends.

What is most amazing is not only the scintillating central performance by Paquin, but also the many and varied cameo roles of the supporting cast. The story has great energy and depth and we get the gradual reconciliation of mother and daughter, after the savagery, distrust and emotional turmoil of the earlier episodes. The camera work is immense as the lens trawls the citys buildings, streets, skies, often slowing time down as it pursues the panorama of space to evoke underlying feelings. The music accompanying this is wonderful right up to the operatic episodes, with the singing often evoking tears as it relates to the drama. You may have some doubts to overcome about the enormous length of the film and wonder if further editing was necessary. I feel the length was justified due to the emotional intelligence of the screenplay,and the rhythms and pacing of the drama. Very rarely will you see this opening out of peoples emotions due to the commercial pressures of making films, the need to tell a story with the minimum fuss. This director has a vision we should cherish in an age of sequels, prequels and franchises which are to often churned out for money. This film will outlast many of the great number of releases coming out now. An amazing, indelible piece of artistry by a writer-director to look out for.(Known also for Oscar-winning Manchester at Sea 2017).",1342569600,3,3868,4.90381679389313

4720624,5,B005LAIGF0,"This movie, set in New York City, presents us with the seventeen-year-old Lisa (convincingly portrayed by Anna Paquin).  Kenneth Lonergan directs her, and a broad talented cast, in a powerful film concerning the results due to a major tragedy: Life-shattering results.

The insightful J. Smith-Cameron portrays Joan, who does a poignant job as Lisa's rather confused mother.  She is bewildered but increasingly patient with Lisa while she starts a seemingly out of nowhere rebellion. Taking hit after hit from the daughter she no longer knows nor understands, beginning quickly and without warning.

There isn't much character building for an audience to view before a horrific accident happens right in the very street in front of a young Lisa.  This is no ordinary occurrence, as it is so shocking and painfully real that I had to stop the film directly afterward to catch my own breath.  I was literally in tears for a while. That was how awestruck I was from this as it is so meticulously done along with Allison Janney as the victim at the scene with Lisa.  This immediately sets into motion the above-written series of conditions in the title of the review. A chain reaction, if you will. It's that sudden, that mercurial also. If this were a true story, Lisa would never have a hope of being the same person that she was again. This would change her life, her perspective and the way she reacts from this point on.

It is usual that behavior becomes problematic after a traumatic incident, as each one is subjective to the person experiencing it. This occasion is to the extreme for Lisa, actually, it would be for anyone who would be forced to witness this. Trauma is a dance in hell.  The memory of it is written in indelible ink on one's psyche.

The perfection in the facial expressions with the photography (Ryszard Lenczewski) and several director's still shots express so much of the oncoming symptoms that Lisa will begin projecting straight away. These are all branded during the lurid tragedy scene in the street; graphically filmed and superbly acted.

Lisa becomes quite extroverted with her inflammatory statements and angry outbursts directed towards everyone, especially attacking and alienating her mother. She is self-medicating with certain drugs, rebellious and altogether confrontational. Lisa says of herself, ""I'm this mass of conflicting impulses"".  With this statement, Lisa is very self-aware.  She also begins doing poorly in school while beforehand she was working towards a scholarship.  Along with getting into wrongful and ill-advised behaviors with certain teachers, especially Matt Damon, she is also with other boys.  It really does not matter to Lisa who the person may be, as she is becoming hyper-sexual.

Lisa rapidly is painting a portrait of inappropriateness and she does not care one little bit about anything, with one exception. This being her initial statement given to the police at the time of the incident, as she obsessively starts seeking an end result to this issue.

These stressful situations elevate to a fever pitch before the movie can conclude. Ending in a very subtle and a single outpouring of emotion.  Hopefully, Lisa can finally feel the warmth along with her mother that she has been keeping at arm's length and kept forcing out since she was traumatized.  Lisa begins to appear that she is on her way home again as she gets more and more honest with everything, but mainly, she gets honest with herself.",1342483200,6,3473,4.998263888888889
4720625,4,B005LAIGF0,"Its not that I like Anna as my favorite actress. I like Samantha. I think she acts different than other actors. Its real but than its stilted. She is touchy and peculiar in this film. She has a style of acting that is her own. The thing I related to was Lisa wanted the bus driver to feel some of her pain and guilt that she had experienced from the accident. She saw him as shut off and unemotional after the death of the walker. I think her life had changed dramatically after what she had witnessed. It triggered lots of anger in her dealings with others, especially, with mother and possible father figures. I felt something inside after her truth with how it was being settled. The things I liked in the film, I liked the channeling, the intelligence, the connections that she followed without much artifice, she dealt with people being blunt or negative without folding, it wasn't a colorful film but it was rich in a different way. I decided to write more on this film. Maybe the film wanted the viewer to see how a person can shut off from their world and set of experiences. Like the bus driver, he ultimately chose to push or not really connect with the trauma of the accident. We only see one point of connection of this driver, who knows what he does in the night with what happened to him that dark day. Maybe he crys to himself or he has nightmares, maybe he is coping with it the best he can, maybe he shuts off to the girl because he is afraid, afraid to show his vulnerability, maybe it hurts to much. Thats the thing with movies, we just see that frame not the whole life and the moments that make the total instead of just parts. Its sad because we tend to judge and don't really know the truth of a person. Well, thats what I think. Maybe he was just so afraid and pretended because he didn't know what would happen if he opened his heart.",1342396800,2,1859,4.299145299145299

4720630,4,B005LAIGF0,"Really don't understand how in the world Anna Paquin was not one of the Oscars contenders for this movie.

This movie should be cut in half. It's over 2h 30 minutes and there is no reason for this. The long shots over New York sometimes taking over 30 seconds are boring. The DVD has the extended version (...over 3 hr). I haven't seen it yet but I wonder how much longer the shots of New York could be.

Anna Paquin is outstanding. Her acting in this movie is something I have only seen from Meryl Streep. She has a great future in the acting business. Again, I really don't understand why she was not nominated for an Oscar (...maybe because she is not part of the establishment and the Hollywood in-crowd).

Now to the movie. A bus driver is distracted by a totally irresponsible adolescent and kills a woman who was waiting at a pedestrian cross over. This is a tragic accident very well portrayed in the movie (...blood all over the place with amputation). It is quite obvious that she (Anna Paquin) feels guilty because SHE is responsible for the accident. She never tells anybody the real story about the stupid hat that resulted in someones tragic death. She then takes it on the driver and soon she makes herself believe that it was the driver's fault.

Very well done movie and the subplot with her divorced parents it is very credible and very interesting. In most recent movies we are getting the message that most modern couples are irresponsible. They get together, have kids and then everybody wants to live like they were single again. In the mean time the daughter is looking for attention to boys in school who are on drugs and selfish. We don't know much about her little brother, but we can guess that he is going to grow up to become another dysfunctional member of our society BECAUSE of his parents.

Her mom wants to be a mom but still works 18 hours a day, and her dad wants to be around but he moved across the country and now has an hysterical selfish girlfriend (...oh wait he is on the west coast, that's normal). When you have kids you have to give up things. You have to compromise for the good of the kids. Most adults are now the product of divorced parents, are screwed up, are making the psychiatrists rich and think that is normal. No it is not! There are normal kids out there with a mom and a dad at home!

4720632,4,B005LAIGF0,"I watched the longer director's cut after watching the theatrical release on streaming because I didn't want to miss a masterpiece. It turns out an extra half hour doesn't make or break this film, but I was glad for the exercise because I wanted more clues to the film's intentions. It has a naturalistic sprawl to it that challenges one to tie everything together neatly.

Anna Paquin plays Lisa, a high-school student who inadvertently causes an accident and for her own redemption seeks some form of accountability for the victim's death. For all her noble intentions, she's not an entirely likable character. As a private school student in NYC, she reflexively knows she's entitled, but there's a fine line between being self-aware and self-absorbed. The victim's best friend warns her not to make the tragedy her own story. Adolescents don't feel more because they haven't experienced anything yet, they just feel more easily, she says.

Yet we're thrown into sympathy with how and what she sees. She's in a period of life where she's figuring out what's important to her. There's a cacophony of voices out there and what happens to seep in is partly what will define you forever. She seethes with teenage contempt for her mother while speaking with affable deference on the phone to her father, who lives on the other coast. She makes her first forays into sexual experience with both frankness and diffidence. She's the most openly guarded young woman on the Upper West Side. Paquin plays her part with electrifying and unpredictable verve. Matt Damon, as her math teacher, eyes her warily like she's a bomb waiting to go off, which is both amusing and well warranted.

Differences between the director's cut and the theatrical release: The main action is the same, but Lonergan flushes out her relationships with the various boys/men in her life, so later scenes don't seem so sudden. In the first half, it's helpful and in the second half, I actually prefer the more abrupt and ambiguous nature of the released cut. Lisa's mom has more scenes with her suitor and there are more school scenes, showing Lisa is involved in a play, effectively a therapy session for the kids and dividing the kids who are wrapped up in their earnest feelings from the ones who've chosen to take the view of ironic detachment. I could take it or leave it. But the reason I would recommend the longer cut are the shots of New York. The briefer shots of the city in the shorter version seem more perfunctory or maybe pretentious--yes, that is slow-mo walking. But in the longer version, they feel more organic. These aren't Woody Allen shots of the golden skyline and gleaming bridges. Rather they are views from buildings of other taller buildings. A cocoon of humanity.

And what I loved most in both versions are all the small things that are finely observed. The universal furious hand-waving signifying the person in the room to shut up as ONE IS ON A VERY IMPORTANT PHONE CALL; Lisa walking on the street through a pack of boys, vibrating with self-consciousness and defiance. I know if I had seen this in a theater, we would have all laughed at the teen boy crying after an unsuccessful phone call. It may be a failure of this ambitious work that was so exalted that I remember all the small, domestic details more, but everyone will probably take something different from this movie.",1342137600,24,3377,4.797250859106529
4720633,5,B005LAIGF0,"I can't remember the last time I've been so moved by a film -- maybe never.  What's it about?  Everything.  It's hard to think of a major theme of human existence that is not explored in this movie.  What it's mostly about is a teenage girl's confrontation with mortality.  The title comes from a beautiful poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins called ""Spring and Fall,"" which is read in the film by Matthew Broderick, playing Anna Paquin's high school English teacher:

To a young child

Margaret, are you grieving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Leaves, like the things of man, you
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
Ah! as the heart grows older
It will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
And yet you will weep and know why.
Now no matter, child, the name:
Sorrow's springs are the same.
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
It is the blight man was born for,
It is Margaret you mourn for.

Even now as I read that poem and recall the powerful closing moments of the movie -- where Paquin weeps and knows why -- a tear comes to my eye.

The film has an effortless realism.  The classroom scenes and the lawyers are pitch-perfect.  I mention them in particular, because movies usually get them wrong.  The depiction of smart teenagers (and teachers) -- what they say and how they say it -- is dead-on.  Every character is fully drawn.  You know them all, and empathize.  Some think the movie is too cluttered.  I suppose the Matt Damon subplot is the least successful -- at least in the theatrical cut -- but I did not find the movie overstuffed.  You need it all to appreciate the girl's coming of age as she deals with so many of the usual adolescent challenges, plus the outrageous fact of death.

This is a brilliant, spellbinding movie from start to finish.",1342051200,101,1856,4.505988023952096
4720812,5,B005LAIGF0,"MARGARET is and has been a troubled movie - sophisticated examination of one girl's post-traumatic transformation as part of a larger point about how one's notion of importance is dwarfed by the larger worldview. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and shot in 2005 as a three-hour film, the movie has remained on the shelves since its completion in 2007 over legal problems and finally is available for viewing in a 150-minute version. Though it has flaws it contains some of the most sophisticated dialogue and philosophical points about where we are in our society today that the editing glitches become secondary background noise in a compelling film. The title (no one in the film is named Margaret) references the Gerald Manley Hopkins poem `Spring and Fall: to a young child' which is quoted at the top of this review.

MARGARET focuses on a 17-year-old New York City high-school student Lisa (Anna Paquin) who feels certain that she inadvertently played a role in a traffic accident that has claimed a woman's life, Monica (Allison Janney): Lisa was chasing a bus whose driver Maretti (Mark Ruffalo) ran a red light because of Lisa's distraction trying to discover where the Maretti bought his cowboy hat. Monica dies in Lisa's arms while asking for her daughter also named Lisa (we later learn Monica's daughter died at age 12 from leukemia). Lisa at first feels sorry for Maretti, thinking that if she tells the truth Maretti will loose his job and his family support. Lisa's actress mother Joan (J. Smith-Cameron) encourages her to not give accurate testimony to the police, a decision Lisa follows and spends the rest of the film regretting, and in making attempts to set things right she meets with opposition at every step. Torn apart with frustration, she begins emotionally brutalizing her family, her friends, her teachers, and most of all, herself. She has been confronted quite unexpectedly with a basic truth: that her youthful ideals are on a collision course against the realities and compromises of the adult world.

The world that Lisa occupies includes teachers - played by Matt Damon (who crosses a forbidden line when Lisa seeks his advice as the only truly adult man she knows, Matthew Broderick whose class discussions over literature are brittle and acerbic and deeply disturbing - her introduction to adolescent needs and physical incidents at the hands of John Gallagher, Jr. (now of The Newsroom fame), Paul (Kieran Culkin) - her relationship with her needy single mother Joan whose newly dating Ramon (Jean Reno), her contact with the deceased's friend Emily (Jeannie Berlin - brilliant), and the deceased's only family - all in an attempt to somehow set things right but Lisa admitting that she is as responsible for Monica's death as is Maretti.  But the world outside can't cope with anything but financial compensation as the resolution to Lisa's angst.

There are many other characters brought to life by some VERY fine actors and the stunning musical score by Nico Muhly includes moments at the Metropolitan Opera where we actually get to see and hear Christine Goerke as Bellini's Norma singing `Casta Diva' and Rene Fleming and Susan Graham singing the Barcarolle from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman, allowing the opening and closing of the film to be accompanied by a quiet guitar piece, as well as proving Muhly's very highly accomplished music to underscore the moods of the film. The cinematography by Ryszard Lenczewski underlines the tension - form the imagery of slow motion crowd movement in New York during the opening sequences to the stabilization of important encounters between the characters.  A lot is said and screamed and the level of communication and actions by Anna Paquin's Lisa alienate the audience at times, but the film makes some very solid statements about how we are acidly interacting or not connecting in our current state of society.  That deserves attention. The film requires a lot form the audience, but in this viewer's mind it is well worth the time.  Grady Harp, July 12",1342051200,17,4052,5.011887072808321

4720814,4,B005LAIGF0,"A complex, difficult, amazing film with a convoluted history, Kenneth Lonergan's ""Margaret"" came and went, appeared, disappeared, was brought back long enough to garner more than 50 places on 2011's top-ten lists. But, other than enthusiastic critics, audiences were miniscule.

To remedy that, the San Francisco Film Society ([...]) brought ""Margaret"" to the SFFS Cinema back in February, when I saw this challenging film of great artistic value.

""Margaret"" is living proof that the ""thumbs up/down"" school of reporting is idiotic at best. Not even the many arms of Lord Ganesh are sufficient here.

On one hand, it's a 2 1/2-hour meditation on teenage angst, self-absorption, hysterics, and barely suppressed urge to cause harm. On the other hand, ""Margaret"" is a compulsive, engrossing, illuminating film.

You may see it as an anguished tug-of-war between taking responsibility or being sucked into the bottomless hole of obsession. Or, the film can be seen as a landmark drama about the irresistible pull of a thoroughly unsympathetic, unlikeable character, not seen on the screen since John Cassavetes' sport with Gena Rowlands.

If you think a Manhattan teenager cannot match the repulsion of Richard III, let Anna Paquin in the leading role change your mind. (Among the film's complications: Paquin is Lisa, not the title role; there is no character in the film named Margaret, but if you pay close attention to a class about poetry, you'll understand.)

So now, we come to the task even more onerous than the business with thumbs: ""what is it about?""

""Margaret"" is about Paquin's smart, affluent, confused teenager (and she is that, even if she was already 23 when the film was made in 2005) being involved in a fatal street accident. There - isn't that helpful? Not really, in view of the parade of characters and situations that follow.

That parade, by the way, is an impressive list of names: J. Smith-Cameron as Lisa's mother, Matt Damon and Matthew Broderick among her teachers, Kieran Culkin and a bunch of young Turks among her classmates; also Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, and others, but from the moment she first appears, Jeannie Berlin makes everybody recede into the background.

Apparently, a main reason for ""Margaret"" being held up for five-six years was Lonergan's refusal to cut the original three-hour running time. Now that a half hour of that is gone (and there are visible clumsy cuts), the film is still too long.

Thumbs cannot express the difference between holding a film in high esteem and faulting the director for lack of discipline. So, on one hand, it tries the viewer's patience, but on the other, as Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Susan Graham sing ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" Barcarolle in the Met for the film's finale, you experience the conflict's partial, tentative resolution more fully than if it was the ""right length.""",1341964800,8,2857,5.059574468085106
4720815,4,B005LAIGF0,"If you tried to watch this in movie theaters and then got a chance to watch it on DVD or streamed it instantly  (as I did) you can compare the different versions. There is a  DVD version for sale which includes scenes cut from the theatrical release.

This film review is based on the film's Instant View version of the film which seems to be the shorter version, clocking in at 2 and 1/2 hours.

Potential viewers should know that lawsuits delayed release of the movie and DVD due to disputes with the producer, the screenwrier, etc. Could a 3 hour movie be cut to 2 and 1/2 hours and would that affect the movie's integrity and flow?

Eventually, the movie was shortened, and (sadly) released in just two theaters.

This film is worth seeing by so many more people than those who made it to those 2 theatres. Yes, the film has its flaws. But it is also a complex and thought- provoking exploration of the consequences of  life after witnessing a terrible accident and trying to grapple with doing the ""right thing.""

Here are some reasons to watch this movie and the serious questions and issues facing potential viewers:

 Early on, a young woman, Lisa (played by Anna Paquin), witnesses a shocking tragedy, one where she feels involved and responsible (at least, in part). How would someone still evolving into adulthood face that? How would she react? This is a MAJOR focus of the movie and also one of the reasons people didn't like it. There is a lot of adolescent drama, often extended and intense. Some feel it goes on too long and stretches credibility.
I confess that I was one of those who had issues with Lisa's endless drama and attempts to contact others affected by the tragic accident and push their boundaries. Her actions are  what another character labels as ""strident"", including Lisa's language, attitude, and inability to gauge the discomfort of those around her.

But the interview I heard with Kenneth Lonergan (who appears in the film along with his wife) gave me a new perspective. I went back and watched the film again.

And I rethought my first response and wondered: how would someone so young possibly react under the circumstances? How would a  college student's identity and emergence into adulthood be affected? What would be the range of reactions? These questions gave me pause. Perhaps what seems grating and even obnoxious in Lisa - and could turn off viewers- makes sense after all. It did to me - on my second viewing.
 Does the final scene at the opera, the point where films traditionally reach a resolution, mesh with all the events before then? I think it does, reflects Lisa's vulnerability. But I can see both sides of this.

I also hope you watch Mark Ruffalo's performance as a bus driver linked with pivotal events. He is an actor who doesn't always get enough attention because his performances seem understated. But he is superb in this movie.

I've left out so much. Please see this film.",1341964800,11,2941,4.690661478599222
4720816,3,B005LAIGF0,"""I know I was distracting you but I did see the bus go through the red light and I saw you hit that woman."" Lisa Cohen (Paquin) is a typical New York teenager. Doin OK in school and has a testy relationship with her mother. One day she goes out looking for a cowboy hat and after a few stores she is disappointed when she can't find one. By chance she notices that a bus driver (Ruffalo) is wearing one and she runs along side of the bus trying to get his attention. He smiles and waves at her, taking his eyes off the road and ends up running down and killing a woman. Trying to protect herself and the driver Lisa doesn't tell the truth in the report. That lie begins to consume her life and she is now bent on revealing the truth, but that sounds easier then it is. I have thought for awhile that when a movie starts to creep up on the 2 1/2 hour mark it better be worth it and interesting. I also think that some directors take the stance that the longer the movie the better the movie. This is not always the case. I open with that for a reason. This is actually a pretty good movie that deals with an interesting issue about a teenager dealing with a traumatic experience in her day to day life. The main problem with this is that it tried so hard to show how she was dealing with it that they couldn't decide what to cut out. So they showed just about everything. Unnecessary scenes of her at school and a whole sub-plot about her mother's stage play and boyfriend really took the focus off of the main reason for the movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie because it is worth watching, but it could have taken a lot out to give it the emotion that it should have. Overall, a decent movie but because of too much going on it was hard to stay focused and emotionally involved. Watch it and you will see what I mean.

4720817,2,B005LAIGF0,"First of all - surprise! - the Theatrical Cut is superior to the Director's cut, which feels like an early assembly full of sloppy editing and unnecessary longeurs. One wonders if Fox released this version simply to embarass Lonergan, following their high profile falling-out... Quite possible. In any case, that the director had to borrow $1m to complete the editing of his version is a wastefulness to rival Lehman Brothers (an NYU student could've done a better job on their laptop for a dime).

As for the film itself - surprise again - it fails to live up to the hype. Lonergran is actually an okay writer, his characterizations frank and three dimensional, and his narrative is compelling enough on first viewing, if unsubtle. Perhaps a great director, a Malick or a Scorsese, or indeed an Antonioni (whose work this superficially resembles), could've delivered something genuinely profound here. Sadly, in Lonergan's inexperienced directoial hands, Margaret never rises above the level of an upmarket cable movie-of-the-week, a splurge of uber-bland coverage and histronic performances, poorly paced and further weighed down by a portenious score, cliched use of slow-motion and an unjustified air of self-importance. Ruffalo and Damon meanwhile are wasted in tangential roles, although it must be said that Jean Reno delivers his strongest performance in years, albeit again only playing a minor character.

The final result then is little more than tiring Oscar-bait of the Crash variety and, in a strong year for American cinema, there's no need to waste your time with this: watch instead The Tree of Life, Hugo, Into the Abyss, Mildred Pierce, Texas Killing Fields, The Descendants and/or Sucker Punch.",1341446400,8,1714,5.251824817518248

This is an absolute must see movie. A+ cast! Stellar performances by Anna Paquin and J Smith Cameron. Paquin plays Lisa a 17 year old girl high school student and lives in Manhattan with her mother (Cameron) and brother. Smart script and dialogue about how life chews us up and spits us out.

When Lisa sets out to find a cowboy hat, she inadvertently causes the death of a woman crossing the street.

Guilt and frustration alters her already ""too smart for her own good"" youthful view of the world.  The movie takes its time and centers around complex day to day issues; death, hatred, real world events like 9/11, racial differences, teen pregnancy, drugs and divorce. Sounds like a devastating film? It isn't it is a centered, deep, thought provoking movie of the realities of the world our children are growing up in and how it affects them.
