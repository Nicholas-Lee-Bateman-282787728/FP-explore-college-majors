2417446,3,B000BIBGR2,"As 2006 will be the 40th anniversary of Star Trek, I'm guessing there will be something available next year at this time that will potentially blow everyone's doors off.  I think this is just a way to fuel the cash cow that is Star Trek.

The BBC didn't do something this grand in 2003 for their 40 year old show, ""Doctor Who"".  However, I'll give them props for dropping the bomb that they were going to begin making the program again.

I'm sure this time next year, we'll have a complete package with TAS plus a whole slew of bloopers to gawk at.  I'm sure this will  also come with a wonderfully inflated price tag of $3000.  After all, it's the 40th anniversary.

I really don't know where Paramount get off charging this much for Star Trek sets.  Realistically this should be more around the $1500 range.

$40 per season of programming x 28 seasons = $1120

$30 per movie x 10 films  = $ 300

Total  $1420

Add on some premium for packaging, etc.  $1499

Tacking on that extra $1000 for this set is a bit much and just plain greedy.",1131321600,23,1037,4.317708333333333
2417447,3,B000BIBGR2,"Although it would be very nice to be able to pick up every piece of Trek ever shown on television in one massive swoop, the price here is just outrageous - especially compared to other television shows. Compare the cost here to the price of a season of other television shows:

A season of West Wing - $40

A season of The Shield - $42

A season of The Simpsons - $32

A season of The Sopranos - $65

A season of Law and Order - $30

Yet in this mega-collection you end up paying a staggering $85 per season after you subtract out the cost of the movies. I would be curious to know how Paramount justifies such high prices for shows that have been off the air for years when recently-run shows that are still in production go for less than half the price.",1131321600,66,755,4.136986301369863
2417448,5,B000BIBGR2,Not only is the animated series missing... what about the BLOOPER REELS?  I don't see how this can honestly be labelled ultimate without that little piece of Trek history.,1131321600,11,171,4.896551724137931
2417449,3,B000BIBGR2,"I'm sure that having all the material would be cool, but what about the fact that HD TV is right around the corner? The film reels can be rescanned at higher HD resolution to produce better digital content. Won't people who pay this much money fell a little crappy when a few years from now their ""ultimate star trek collection"" looks crappy compared to the other material they are capable of viewing.",1131321600,12,401,4.583333333333333
2417450,3,B000BIBGR2,"First of all, I'm a fan of the series, specially The Next Generation which was my favorite (and the series's two-part finale ""All Good Things"" was probably the best 2 hours of television I have enjoyed in my life), but seriously, why charge so much? Make this US$999 and not only would the studios still be making insane amounts of money, but I bet they'd sell WAY more copies as well.

Also, how about subtitles in other languages other than English? Star Trek is one of those series that has a huge following all over the planet, and neglecting that 30% of its audience speaks spanish is a bad choice from the DVD producers. I'd love to buy this series and send it to my folks for christmass, but they barelly speak english.",1131321600,10,726,4.458646616541353
2417451,5,B000BIBGR2,"I have to wonder how much of a market there would be for this.  Who out there is a big enough Trek fan to purchase all this, and not already have a portion of it collected already.  This set basically takes everything that has been released so far and sells it as a complete package.  Personally, I already have it all, except the 4th season of Enterprise because Costco let me down and didn't have it on the release date, so I'm about to order it on this site.

The only thing missing is the Animated Series.  This is understandable because as stated this set is merely everything released so far, and TAS has not had a DVD release.  I doubt such a release is far off, as Paramount no doubt wants to milk every cent it can by putting Trek on DVD, and TAS is pretty much all that is left.  I definitely expect a 2006 release to be announced soon.

If you haven't purchaced any Trek DVDs yet, this is certainly a good deal.  Or even if you have a limited collection, this might be an opportunity to purchase the whole Trek canon at a great price and perhaps sell off what you've already acquired.  But if you already have a substantial collection, I suggest merely filling in the holes.  Amazon.com has all the individual seasons, as well as all the complete series as specially packaged sets.",1130889600,24,1292,4.364016736401673
2417452,3,B000BIBGR2,"I love everything Star Trek.  I am a prime customer for Star Trek on DVD.  However when all other TV shows sell for $20 to $50 on DVD the wonderful Star Trek people want over $100 each for their DVD's.  Even this so called ultimate deal is still $90 per season when you drop out the movies we all have already.

Why do they do this to us who love Star Trek?  The new price should be $1000 to $1400 for this set.  When they get real I will own this set.",1130198400,28,452,3.858695652173913
2417453,5,B000BIBGR2,"Well, now I know what I want if I hit the lottery.

Almost everything Trek related.  All 10 movies - all in the new 2-disc director's cut editions.  All five series boxed sets - Classic Trek, Next Gen, Deep Space 9, Voyager, and Enterprise.

Almost everything a Star Trek fan could ever want in one place at a discount price.

BUT - It's still missing the Animated Series.  Paramount is scheduled to release the animated series to DVD sometime in early 2006, but currently they're only available on VHS.  There's no way this will be the ""ultimate"" Star Trek collectors set until it contains the animated series episodes.

I have no idea how many hours of viewing pleasure this amounts to, but I know it's a lot.

It would be nice to have the ultimate Star Trek resource.  But this isn't it.  But even though it's not complete, I'd still recommend it if you haven't splurged on the sets already.",1130025600,7,894,4.525

The Ultimate Star Trek collection is basically being released basically because being there is no more new Star Trek series being produced anymore.

Voyager - $810

2417457,5,B000BIBGR2,"I bought every item in this collection one-by-one as they have come out in the last 4 years.  I even have the old versions of the movies (sigh) and I paid way, way, way more than then the asking price for this set.  Unlike other DVD sets, you'll notice that individual seasons have actually gone up in price since thier release.  So, I suggest that if you love star trek THAT much, you bite the bullet and count yourselves lucky.  Besides, you should know that the average Star Trek fan is more affluent than any other fan base.  AND you can bet your favorite tricorder that Paramount knows that too.  Taking all that into account, the price is right.",1132358400,6,651,4.428571428571429

I think I will wait till Paramount finally comes to its senses and drops the price by half or better.  Talk about price gouging! The cost for many other series collections that are still in production is less than half of what you would pay for this one.  It is evident that once again, Paramount has made a ""really good decision"" regarding Star Trek....",1131926400,10,457,4.2298850574712645
2417459,5,B000BIBGR2,"Even with a four figure price range,This collection features some of the greatest Sci-Fi stories ever told, and a wet dream to any Trekker who has yet to move out of their parent's basement.
Even with five spinoffs,ten movies and nearly 40 years of history,The original Star Trek (1966-1969) is the one that started it all and continue to inspire millions of fans.
The plot was simple, in the future a starship goes out on a five year mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and civilizations. Led by the heroic Captain James T. Kirk (willian Shatner) along with his Vulcan first officer Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy).The other crew members include Dr. Leonard McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley),Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott(the late James Doohan), Helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takai),Communications officer Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Paval Chekov (Walter Keonig),and Yoaman Janice Rand (Grace Lee whitney who would only last half the first season).
After three low rated seasons, ST was finally cancelled after 78 aired episodes in 1969. Even fans couldn't save it, as NBC buried the show. But thanks to syndication, ST became even more popular than when it originally aired and build upon a growing franchise (Conventions, Saturday Morning cartoons,toys, etc,).
Star Trek The Animated Series(1973-1975) continuing the five year mission which only lasted three on the original series. Not considered canon to most Trek-philes,it was a sucess on all fronts. Unfortunately the series only ran for 22 episodes although over the years, it has been shown in re-runs and available on VHS.Set for release in 2006, a DVD set of the entire series would be a must for any fan of Trek, especially those who have purchased the boxed sets of TOS,TNG, DS9,Voy and ENT.Hopefully this forgotten series would be re-evaluated and given the respect it deserves.
 Ten years after the final episode, including a resurgence that was bigger than it's low Neilson dictated,the first motion picture based on the original Star Trek series arrived in theaters. It would also spawn a successful film series that would go on through nine more movies and 23 years(1979-2002) with a varying degree of success.
When TNG(1987-1994) first premeired ,many veiwers were still spoiled by the original series. It soon surpassed the original series in quality and longeviety. Even after the 178 episode, four movies that seemed like big screen TV movies ,and following in the footsteps of a phenomenon as big as the original series ,The Next Generation proved that Star Trek's influence was nowhere near dissipating, and would be around for the long run.
Star Trek Deep Space Nine(1993-1999) will always be the cult within the cult. Although not as popular as the other Star Trek spin-offs(even the anemic Voyager who had the benefit of the UPN network behind it),it has the diehard follwing of Trekker Niners who'll easily attest that DS9 was the best Trek show ever.
Unlike the other spin-offs,the show as well as the characters evolved in its seven seasons. Notably The lead character Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) who started as a brooding arbitrator of a rundown space station. In the later seasons, the character was injected with the same passion that fueled Kirk and Picard,becoming a great Captain as well as accepting his role as the Bajoran's Emissary and in the end,joined the Bajoran prophets. Sisko's crew includes first officer/Bajoran lieson Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor),Trill science officer Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell),Cheif Medical Officer Dr Julian Bashir(Alexander Siddig),Cheif of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and changeling Security Chief Odo (Rene Abourjonios).Station residences includes Ferengi Barkeeper Quark (Armin Shimmerman), Cardassian Tailor, former spy Garak (Andy Robinson) and Sisko's son Jake (Cirroc Lofton).
Although known as the darkest of all the Trek shows(despite having some of the most humorous episodes in the entire franchise)DS9 has the most complex storytelling ever to come out of Gene Roddenberry's universe.
 Star Trek Voyager(1995-2001) premiered on the new UPN network to alot of press and hype. At The time, Trek was at it's height. TNG first movie Generations was a box office hit,and DS9 was into it's transitional third season. Voyager was important in the fact that it was not only to launch the UPN network,but most importantly be the first Trek series to feature a female captain,Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew). Voyager began on an excellent start on only to succumb to The writers and producers bowing to the UPN network's demands that the show be commercial as well as draw in veiwers by any means necessary.
The premise of the show was Voyager originally pursuing a ship of Federation freedom fighting outlaws called the Maquis, only for both ships to be swept 70,000 light years away from Federation space. Both crews merged to work together to find a way home which would take seventy-five at maximum warp.
The crew included Chakotay (Robert Beltran) the Native American Maquis commander who now serves as Voyager's XO,Tuvok (Tim Russ)the Vulcan chief of security,Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) a former convict now serving as Voyager's pilot,B'Ellana Torres (Roxanne Dawson)half Klingon former Maquis now Chief Engineer,Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) recent Starfleet graduate Ops officer, and""The Doctor"" (Robert Picardo)an emergency medical hologram now the CMO.Also along for the journey are two new members indiginous to the distant Delta Quadrant,Neelix (Ethan Phillips) who serves as ship's cook and guide,and his lover,Kes (Jennifer Lien)an Ocampa who's lifespan is only nine years.
 Although Voyager is regarded as the weakest of the Trek series,it had many great moments,and affection for the crew made viewers continue to tune in despite it's less than stellar storytelling .Even with all it's flaws,it was still better than most shows on the air at the time,plus it would be interesting if the show plays better on DVD almost a decade after it's premere. In all,sticking with this show for seven mediocre seasons,it made you smile at the end to see these characters finaly come home.
After Voyager completed it's run,the UPN network and Star Trek producer Rick Berman with writer/producer Brannon Braga introduced viewers to Enterprise(2001-2005,later renamed Star Trek Enterprise in season three).
This fifth live action series from the franchise took place a century before James T. Kirk's five year voyage of the original series. This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ship in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.
The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), consisted of the Vulcan liason/first officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).
The show had the distinction of being the series that ruined an almost forty year old franchise. But in the end it's only crime was bad timing, the creators total disregard to continuity,as well as wasting time putting around the galaxy, and focusing on the confusing Temporal Cold War while fans wanted to see the early days of Starfleet leading up to the founding of the United Federation of Planets. At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation,which wasn't adressed until the fourth and final season. Viewership dwindled by it's racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnessesary ""Temporal Cold War"" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt prefunctuary as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.
Unfortunately,Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to it's cancellation. The finale (written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga) was called a ""Valentine to the fans""(..These Are The Voyages).But the real valentine was the entire fourth season which finally gave the fans what they wanted,and the most problematic Star Trek series a dignified ending, dispite it's weak finale.
Despite the decline of Trek in the past few years,it's legacy shows that it won't stay dormant for long.",1131753600,9,8593,5.321559970566593
2417460,3,B000BIBGR2,Besides being WAY too expensive (thanks again Paramount for ripping off the fans) this set is missing the animated series.  I think I'll have to pass on this one.,1131667200,6,162,4.586206896551724
2417461,5,B000BIBGR2,"The three of us purchased TNG, DS9, and Voyager as they came out. It was $100 per season. We liked the series enough to split up the costs so we could see them all. So we spent $2100+ just for three seasons. For less than that, you can get everything.",1131321600,,251,4.04
2417462,2,B000BIBGR2,"The ONLY Star Trek series that can be released in Hi Def is the ORIGINAL SERIES.  That show was shot and finished on film.  It won't be widescreen, but the masters are on film so hi def resolution is supported.

However, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager and most of Enterprise was SHOT on film, but edited and finished on NTSC VIDEO (in fact TNG was the first show ever to do this).  That means the master tapes for these shows are all 525 line video and they will never look better than they do on DVD.  It is physically impossible to release them in hi-def.

Enterprise switched over to 16:9, but it was not actually finished in hi def until late in the game.

The movies can all be hi def, except for (sadly) the new edition of ST: The Motion Picture.  The special edition director's cut was only finished on NTSC and can never be upscaled to HDTV.  Only the original theatrical version can be re-scanned to a higher resolution.

2417464,1,B000BIBGR2,"This is really not that hot.

First of all it is overpriced, as one previous review demonstrated. The price per episode of the TV series is about twice as high as for any other DVD set of TV series that you can buy.

Second, it is missing Star Trek - The Animated Series, so it does not include all official Star Trek material.

This is clearly aimed to be an overblown Christmas present for the aging Star Trek fan by his family, but believe me it won't do the job.",1131321600,14,466,4.155555555555556

8086957,3,B000BIBGR2,"I have taken the time to read and evaluate all the reviews on this so-called ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" and found it to be flawed.  From what I've read everyone is ""The Ultimate Star Trek Fan"", who makes some interesting buying points.  (1) There is the animated series from the early 1970s is missing. Was this not a way to get future adults interested and keep ""Star Trek"" alive for a new generation of fans?  (2) There is no collection of bloopers or gag reels.  As much you want to believe the shows future was perfect I'm sure the actors flubbed a line, missed a marked or just couldn't stop laughing at themselves.  And finally with HDTV around the corner this collection should have been made Hi Def ready.  To pay this much for something that will be crappy in a few years is not what one would call a great investment.  So my review is this, ""Paramount if you truly wish for this to be ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" return to the collective and assimilate this information.  Give the fans who stuck by you from the beginning a ""Star Trek"" collection that will make sure that ""Resistance is futile!""  Because I like many of the die-hard ultimate fans would prefer ""The Complete Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" rather than ""The Incomplete Ultimate Star Trek Collection"".

8086958,3,B000BIBGR2,"Right after Christmas 04, the price for season 1 of the x-files dropped from about $100 to $35. I grabbed it off amazon. 2 weeks later, it was back up to $100. Now a year later, the price is dropping again and it looks like for good. The behind the scenes story here is pretty easy to read: The marketers set the price high (like an overpriced house) and hoped it would sell and probably sold few. Then finally the price dropped, thousands of x-heads like me grabbed it cheap. The price went back up and it didn't sell. It took another year for the marketers to figure out the x-files season dvd's will not sell for a premium price.

Right after Christmas 06 the price for seasons 1 - 3 of TNG was cut in half. I own them now. Seasons 4 - 7 are still sky high and actually getting higher. But they won't sell. Fans aren't stupid. We'll wait until the marketers wise up and price this stuff reasonably. Until then, we'll watch seasons 1, 2 & 3 over and over again.",1142294400,13,963,4.205405405405405

However, ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" does not contain all the Star Trek episodes, and it is not reasonably priced.  The animated series from the early 1970s is missing.  To me this is a big omission.  I have seen most of the episodes of every series except the animated series.  One of the reasons that I considered buying ""The Ultimate Star Trek Collection"" was that I would finally be able to see all of the animated series.  Failing to include it makes this product much less appealing to me.  The price is another problem.  US$2500 is a lot of money, particularly for an incomplete collection.

That is more than many people pay for their rent or mortage. I have all the orginal series as well as TNG on DVD already, but with prices like these there is 0 chance of me buying any of Voyager, DS9 or Enterprise. Its a shame though since DS9 was a fine show and I am a fan of Scott Bakula (Captain Archer) of enterprise. I will have to settle for Scott's other Sci-Fi hit Qunatum Leap which is at least priced at a reasonable thirty something dollars price.",1139270400,8,824,4.15625
8086961,1,B000BIBGR2,"Trust me I love star trek and have since I was a kid in the 1960's but the price PARAMOUNT want's for this STAR TREK mega set is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Like many others have said their are better series than Star Trek out here that are still in production that have DVD sets on sale MUCH CHEAPER than the per episode price PARAMOUNT DEMANDS here for Star Trek.  I would pay a slightly higher price for star trek because I love TREK but, I would not submit myself to the brand of blatant highway robbery being proposed here at this overly inflated price.

I already have most of the star trek episodes I really like.  I brought the star trek movies when they were being offered at a better price on DVD individually.  Most of the Star Trek series while good were and are not worth the amounts of money Paramount is asking people to pay here.  Most of the Star Trek Series is way overpriced and I vote on this Star Trek rip off series pricing by letting this crap stay right on the shelf unsold.

PARAMOUNT overpricing the its Star Trek merchandise is doing more to cure me of my Star Trek addiction than anything my family had tried over the years.  I still have a warm place in my heart for Star Trek and likely always will.  Paramount has done a great job of cooling my love of Star Trek to that of a tepid pool, a love for trek that most of my life had the passionate energy well beyond that of any SuperNova.

PARAMOUNT continues to overplay its hand regards Star Trek and in so doing is alienating its once loyal fan base.  After Paramount finishes killing off the rest of its most loyal fan base with its preditory pricing in the fullness of time these way overpriced Star Trek items will be priced realistically and at that time like the Wolf I am I might actually buy them.  Until these overpriced DVD's come down in price segnificantly the best place for these overpriced lamers is the UNSOLD Inventory Sheet's of Paramount Studios \ Viacom Corp'S DVD werehouse.

Another Paramount release, Macgyver, is below $30.00 per season, and yet they still have the nerve to charge $109.00 and more per season of Star Trek just because the fan base would pay it if they wanted it enough.  Personally I am content to watch them in reruns until such a time that they reduce the price to no more than $200.00 for each entire series.  They were great shows, but I would rather spend my money on Buffy seasons 1-7 for $169.99!",1137542400,7,556,4.326923076923077

Lets not even talk about the millions that have been made in syndication. Does paramount think of the little guy? I don't think so. I for one , will be boycotting all future paramount releases.

I want to buy a lot of these Star Trak season sets, but think $100.00+ is way too much.  For crying out loud, Paramount, these can't be selling very briskly anymore.  Just drop the prices and watch them fly off the shelves.",1135123200,7,481,3.9791666666666665
8086965,2,B000BIBGR2,"While I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Star Trek, this is yet another instance of Paramount blatently milking their one true cash cow and ripping off the fans. The price they charge for these dvd sets compaired to what other dvd sets cost is basically criminal. They should be ashamed of themselves.",1133481600,9,301,4.921568627450981
