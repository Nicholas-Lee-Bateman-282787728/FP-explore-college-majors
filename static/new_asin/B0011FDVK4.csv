3064520,5,B0011FDVK4,"Dennis Potter fans stateside should take note that this is the first US release of BLUE REMEMBERED HILLS in any form here. You could order a PAL version from the UK for $40 PLUS shipping (part of the Dennis Potter Collection), but now you can get this important work AND all these other great Helen Mirren performances for $60 in this box set. I don't miss the Shakespeare plays offered in the UK version of this set (I already have them as part of BBC Shakespeare sets)and the Poliakoff Soft Targets is a great bonus. I get a duplication in Apple Cart (which is part of the BBC Shaw set), but still, this new Mirren set is a GREAT VALUE!
Now let's hope BBC get off their bums and issue the Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard plays they have in their vaults BEFORE the tapes completely disintegrate!",1203638400,31,795,4.414965986394558
3064521,5,B0011FDVK4,"In regard to the previous review by Donald J. Lloyd, this set is indeed offered differently in the US and the UK.  Unfortunately, neither is a complete set.  The US set (5 discs; 13 hours and 31 minutes; 9 titles) is missing:

A Midsummer Night's Dream (TV Movie Dec 13, 1981)
Cymbeline (TV Movie Dec 20, 1982)
The Hawk (Theatrical Movie released Dec 10, 1993)

all of which are in the UK set.

However, the UK set (6 discs; 17 hours; 11 titles) is missing:

Soft Targets (Oct 19, 1982 Episode of TV Series Play for Today)

Both sets contain:

The Changeling (Jan 20, 1974 Episode of TV Series Play of the Month)
The Apple Cart (Jan 19, 1975 Episode of TV Series Play of the Month)
Caesar and Claretta (TV Movie May 9, 1975)
The Philanthropist (TV Movie Oct 29, 1975)
The Little Minister (Nov 2, 1975 Episode of TV Series Play of the Month)
The Country Wife (Feb 13, 1977 Episode of TV Series Play of the Month)
Blue Remembered Hills (Jan 30, 1979 Episode of TV Series Play for Today)
Mrs. Reinhardt (Oct 30, 1981 Episode of TV Series BBC2 Playhouse)

The UK set may be ordered from Amazon.co.uk for about USD$60 plus shipping but it is PAL format, Region 2.  A viewer in the US will need a multi-format, multi-region DVD player.

The only title currently available individually is The Hawk (VHS edition available at Amazon).

Helen Mirren is currently one of the most accomplished actors of the last 30 years.  Anyone interested in her acting performances over the 20-year period of these titles will not be disappointed.  It should be noted that an earlier 1968 Theatrical Movie of A Midsummer Night's Dream is also available separately at Amazon.  This is an excellent production and, in addition to Helen Mirren, has performances by Diana Rigg, Judi Dench, Michael Jayston, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.",1199836800,100,1806,4.635220125786163

8241579,1,B0011FDVK4,"I wanted to love the content, but alas, much of it is not accessible, not viewable or listenable. There are serious manufacturing errors in the disks that make much of their content inaccessible (you click on the menu choices and nothing and I mean nothing happens; you can't get past the menu) or only partially accessible (you get halfway or a little more than halfway through a play and the picture and sound seize up/freeze so bad you have to force-eject the disk to get out of it, and get it out, only to have the problem repeat over and over again, so that no matter how you try to jump past or skip the supposed ""bad spot,"" you can never see the final half hour (or whatever) of the work. I am a media professional with high-end equipment and multiple disk players and nothing will play many of these selections and no amount of cleverness on my part can over-ride the problems. This is not a ""single bad disk"" issue caused by dirt, fingerprints, or scratches; it is a disk coding and manufacturing issue that affects many apparently pristine and unplayed disks in many different places. Be forewarned. You will be very frustrated.",1508716800,,1138,4.583333333333333
8241580,5,B0011FDVK4,"Initially bought the wrong DVD set - it was from the UK and I was unable to play the DVDs - so disappointed!  THIS is the right one to be played im American players, for anyone unsure about it.

Quality of the DVDs depends on the disc, but even older ones are good enough to watch without difficulty.  Don't miss her performance in ""The Country Wife"" - she is absolutely adorable, and makes sometimes-obtuse Restoration dialogue easily understandable (the rest of the performances are also excellent).",1491955200,2,501,4.8023255813953485
8241581,3,B0011FDVK4,"Not that crazy about these made for TV plays, though I much love Helen Mirren in her later mature roles in films.

8241585,4,B0011FDVK4,"my mother is a big Helen Merrin fan, as well as myself. i watched this before i gave it to her for her B-Day. it is very good & she loved it. so if you know anyone that has a thing for Merrin, this a great gift. i will never forget her performance as Morgana in John Boorman's quintessential version of Excalibur (1981).",1403827200,,320,4.095238095238095
8241586,2,B0011FDVK4,"Unless you can understand English as it is spoken poorly by many Englishpersons, I would not recommend. After investing so much time in Prime Suspect, I gave up completely. Minutes would go by when I couldn't understand a single word, e.g., the sequence with the interview of the transvestite. This problem persists quite strongly today in Masterpiece Theater.  I have removed it from my DVR scheduling. I have not seen any of her shows in this set but I am not going to take a chance, Mirren is the worst in this respect! She seems to revel in mumbling her lines, as if articulation was a no-no to such a 'sophisticate'.  I will never forgive Mirren for ruining any possibility of enjoyment in Prime S.",1283817600,2,703,4.616
8241587,3,B0011FDVK4,"These are interesting for a fan of Helen Mirren.  The works show her in early roles, so are interesting to compare to her more recent roles.  They are not the most interesting of works themselves.  I'd recommend her later roles over these if a person is limited in the number to purchase.",1268006400,2,288,4.5
8241588,5,B0011FDVK4,"If you value your standing as a Helen Mirren fan, this collection is for you. It's a treat to see her in her sumptuous early career in such a wide variety of roles as well as the later vesion we have to come to know as to Elizabeths and the star of Prime Suspect. It's mostly available on Netflix for previews now.",1251936000,,314,4.080645161290323
