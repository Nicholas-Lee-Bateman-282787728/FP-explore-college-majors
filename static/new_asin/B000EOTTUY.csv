2525757,5,B000EOTTUY,"After reading most of the reviews, I think people are over analizing this movie. The main theme in this movie which is universal is to follow your heart, and not care what others may think. There is no denying that ""Race"" plays a huge role, but the film is fun, and lighthearted. The acting is subtle, and both Sanaa Lathan, and Simon Baker do not over compensate on the ""Race"" issue, unlike some movies such as Crash, and Guess who's Coming to Dinner. Finally, Hollywood had the balls to revisit, and make this topic front and center again in the entertainment industry. I've seen this movie twice in the theater, and I just purchased the DVD today; I think alot of people would enjoy this movie if they open their minds, and hearts to ""Something new"" and different.",1147910400,7,767,4.565217391304348
2525758,4,B000EOTTUY,"""Something New"" is the story of Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan), a young professional black woman who is concerned with making partner at her accounting business and finding a partner for her romantic life.  She is having problems in both areas.  At work she is given a key client who does not like her, and whether it is because she is black, a woman, both, or because she is not telling him what he wants to hear (or all of the above), is not clear.  On the romantic front a friend at work sets her up with a blind date, who turns out to be Brian Kelly (Simon Baker), who is white.  He also happens to be a professional gardener (actually more of a landscape architect), and that would seem to constitute an additional gulf to their having a relationship, because Kenya comes from a family of professionals.  Her mother (Alfre Woodard) keeps score, her father (Earl Billings) keeps silent, and her brother, Nelson (Donald Faison) is almost as upset by his sister dating a gardener as he is by the idea that the guy is white.  Even her girl friends think all she is talking about here is a harmless fling.  But they do not make movies about harmless flings.

The problem is not that Kenya might be falling in love with someone who is a different skin color, but that she might be falling in love period.  The biggest difference between these two is that Brian intends to stop and smell the roses and Kenya is not used to or even comfortable with the idea of making time for herself.  No wonder she is spending money on landscaping for her new home.  It is a lot easier to buy flowers and plants than it is to find a man.  Despite this, there are the early inroads to a romance between the two, which gets as far as kissing and sex.  But that is easy compared to what lies ahead.  A party with her friends is enough of a cold reception, but then there is a comedy club where a female comedienne empties a barrage on Brian and his relationship with a black woman.  If you thought Brian asking Kenya to change her hair was a major mistake in this relationship, then wait until he suggests they spend one night not talking about race.  Then throw into the mix Mark Harper (Blair Underwood), a black professional who Kenya's family would adopt if they cannot get him to marry Kenya.

My complaint, if you want to call it that, is that the two best scenes in ""Something New"" both involve Kenya and another man, but neither of them is with Brian.  The first is between Kenya and her boss (Matt Malloy), where she has to deal with the consequences of her actions at the big meeting with the client who does not like her.  The second is with her father, played out in a location that is seldom used for talks between fathers and daughters.  Up until these scenes this movie was just not connecting with me, because I had bought into the idea that this was a romantic comedy, and that is not really true.  It is certainly not a comedy like ""Guess Who,"" where the racial issue is played for laughs, and it is not the sort of frank discussion we had in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" regarding interracial marriage.  What the two scenes prove that this really is about Kenya becoming a self-actualized person, which happens not only in regards to her love life but also the professional side of her life as well.  A big clue towards this is that we do not really have scenes of Bryan without Kenya or other characters in the picture.  This really is Kenya's story.

Final Note: The working title of the film was ""42.4 Percent,"" which is the percent of African-American women that never get married.  That is certainly an impressive statistic, but fortunately they came up with a different title because the story told by screenwriter Kriss Turner and director Sanaa Hamri is not going to apply to most of the women that make up that particular percentage.  This is not to argue that this story is unrealistic, because even if it is not representative of why most African-American women do not get married, it is still a story worth telling.  I would think that ""Something New"" will strike a responsive chord with professional women, regardless of race.  The other working title for this 2006 film was ""Bloom.""",1147824000,2,4196,4.484210526315789
2525759,4,B000EOTTUY,"I think the movie is very interesting, but it's really just that--a movie. I don't think it's meant to be realistic, but more to make several points and get people in society thinking so that maybe the plot of the movie won't be so far-fetched someday soon.

The most obvious thing is that when interracial dating happens, a black woman is generally not involved. Some white men and some black women might find each other attractive, but most generally just won't go there. The reason why they found each other is because a white co-worker of Sanaa's character set them up, and that almost never would happen in the real world, either. Just like Sanaa's character was expecting a black male to show up and never even considered a white male being her blind date, when most people think to hook someone up they consider that person's race automatically. Even had this not been the case, there likely would have been some communication that, hey, he's white/she's black, is that okay?

Second, I think Sanaa's character's initial reactions to Simon's character were a little TOO much. The conversation with her friends about ""the list"" (i.e. I need a black man who has a job, an education, no kids, etc) was realistic, but I think the majority of blacks would have played off being set up with a white person a lot more than she did, especially with her character being the stiff, unemotional person that she is. She was too off-guard, too overboard in suddenly trying to appear ""down"" with blacks, too blatantly rude to Simon's character. And I also don't think it would be the case that a white male who didn't know he was set up with a black woman, unless he especially liked black women, would have thought nothing of it. He was a bit different, given that he had dated black women before, but I also find that ""convenient"" (see my comments below about ""flipping the script"").

Third, I think this movie just overall went overboard on trying to flip the script in several ways, i.e. the black person being off-guard but the white person isn't, for one. Second and related to the first point, almost all the blacks in it were insanely successful and just snobbish with all these narrowminded notions that eventually crumbled down. And yet, the one major white character in the movie had to be the one to not meet their standards until the end. This is how you normally think of whites vs blacks, and I think that was the point--to show the script flipped. That's not to say that blacks don't have preconceived ideas or racist ideas, or are not ever successful, but it was to such a point that it seemed exaggerated (I think the exaggerations were on purpose to make blacks consider how sometimes we do have narrowminded ideas, just like whites, or do have more in the world sometimes, not to mention it goes with the idea that successful black women have the hardest time finding males). They emphasized the class of the blacks too much and had these blacks doing BAP-ish things that most blacks don't do or care about at all, i.e. a cotillion. All the black women were ridiculously bourgie to me, and that's what made it even more hilarious to me that these blacks were so upperclass and yet had a problem with a black friend or relative dating white...realistically, blacks like that are around whites all the time and would probably have white friends, unlike these people in this movie, so there's no way the thought would never cross their minds.

Still, I don't think anyone was upset *enough* about race, for this kind of movie...and had these not been upperclass blacks who were used to a white world, I would complain more about that. In that sense, I feel like the movie was too ""safe,"" while trying to be more blatant with class differences. The only person REALLY uptight about it was Sanaa's character, and the only way in which she was that I found realistic was the fight in the supermarket with Simon's character about race. I think her subsequently dating a black man was also realistic, but not necessarily the fact that she dumped such an ""ideal black man"" and then got back with the white male. And then, of course, you have the cheesy moments where everyone magically ""understands"" and is giving you the good advice to run after the one you truly love and then she suddenly ""gets it,"" too--it just wouldn't be a movie without all that, huh? There were several other smaller realistic moments, i.e. the hair issue.

I think Simon's character should have been a bit more irritated and/or confused in scenes like Sanaa's character telling him she preferred black men and the black men hasseling him. This is another thing that makes the supermarket fight stand out, because not long after that he finally shows some real irritation with the fact that she's stuck on race. Also key about that scene is he says ""enough with talking about race,"" and that's how it all starts. A lot of us know that white men don't ""get it"" or don't want to hear it, and that's what he showed at that moment, which was so good...it showed him running out of patience. All the moments of his naivete concerning race were important.

Finally, I think their differences were insurmountable, and I'm not talking about race or class. They enjoyed each other and learned from each other, but they had next to nothing in common. That's the kind of couple that, even if they get together in reality, heads to divorce court someday. I am still not clear on exactly how he broke her down. They made love really quickly, and I don't think that, in reality (unless she was just ridiculously [...]), she would have told him ""We are not going out again"" after a clearly bad ""date"" and then just let him take her like that.

In conclusion, watch and analyze for yourself, and decide what you think is realistic or not because there's obviously disagreement among us. You will walk away thinking about several things, and you will want to talk about the movie when it's over, whether or not you agree with it or think it's realistic. I think the movie should have gone deeper with the racial issue, at the very least, but that just wasn't the focus of this film. The broad point was to go after who you love, even if it's not who you expected. Because of that, you don't want to read anything deeper into this movie, i.e. ""This movie tells black women to ditch black men and go for white men"" or ""Wow, white men really DO like black women, and WE'RE the ones who are the racist idiots""--this movie is not saying any of that or anything else that deep. It's just another romantic comedy.",1147737600,5,6568,4.608547008547008

2525761,3,B000EOTTUY,"Preference vs. Prejudice: do you prefer dating your own race or are you prejudiced? It's a good question in these racially charged times and it gets a comedic workout in first-time feature director Sanaa Hamri's ""Something New.""

The 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' comedy formula gets flipped on its ear when a 'white guy' tries to keep it real (sort of). Forget last year's ""Guess Who,"" this is a topnotch romantic comedy that plays the 'race card' for all it's worth, thanks to smart scripting and an even smarter cast.

Sanaa Lathan (""Love & Basketball"") has upped her game, and gives an A-list performance to die for, as the uptight urban yuppie who's white 'gardener' plants a seed where she least expects it.

As her polar opposite (skin color aside), Aussie heartthrob Simon Baker, last seen in George Romero's ""Land of the Dead,"" has the daunting task of melting the ice queen while making the Afro-scene. Cool and charm only go so far, and the sparks really fly when the topic of race is broached once and for all.

What ""Brokeback Mountain"" did for gay romance, this film does for the interracial variety, but with a lot more laughs along the way. If you've been waiting for a perfect pre-Valentine's Day entertainment, you need look no further. ""Something New"" lives up to its title, and then some.

Check it out date-flickers!",1147737600,6,1338,4.774891774891775
2525762,5,B000EOTTUY,"This was a supurb film, one that got far less circulation and discussion than other films that deal, in part, with ""interracial"" relationships. This is most likely due to the fact that it indeed offers something new: an exploration of Black tensions with and resistence to interracial relationships. But there is much more to this film than this. It is also a story of a woman bound by something we all share: the belief that what we have been taught about ourselves and the Other/others is where we find our identity - and the limits this imposes upon us. It is very engaing and enjoyable, and in essence a love story whose messages is this: Something or someone that feels right can be right...even if they come in a different package than we expect.",1147392000,7,752,4.619402985074627

The guy was just sexy, her transformation was palatable, and every woman can identify with a guy who makes them drop the mask and just BE. It wasn't super sappy, they didn't make it perfect or a happily ever after, it was about digging deeper to see someone for who they are not who society tells you to be. She was incredibly difficult and I'm sure most women like that wouldn't be so lucky to have two solid men to choose from, that's always the annoying part of these types of movies lol, but I love this movie.

Premise of the story began believably enough (Black vs. White & the ""pitfalls"" of inter-racial dating), but just the fact that the black woman (Kenya) disliked her white blind-date's dog (among a ""list"" of other things), in real life,  would've been the end of any possible relationship.  I'm not saying that people who have different personalities cannot compliment one another (they often do - quite successfully).  But again (in real life) -- there were too many things that they couldn't agree on/enjoy together, that would've dampened/ended the relationship.  I also found it INCREDIBLY hard to believe that the main character (Kenya) went through such a complete ""change-of-heart"" toward the white man who was so charmingly and lovingly pursuing her (Brian - played adorably AND convincingly by Simon Baker).  This could've been a good movie - even a GREAT movie.  But it just wasn't realistic enough.  I would've found it MUCH more enjoyable, if the characters DIDN'T get together at the end (but rather found happiness with someone else & chalked the whole thing up to a ""learning experience,"" parting amicably & wiser having known one another.",1472083200,,1233,5.0945273631840795

Also,I would have liked more scenes between John Ratzenberger & Simon Baker (that's right, Cliff Clavin from ""Cheers"" is Brain's Dad...but if you blink you'll miss him!). Another thing, why are Kenya and her brother Nelson so insecure, if they are doing well? Presumably, both are GROWN people... well past an age where their parents' opinions matter so deeply. They each could do as they wanted, unless the prospect of being disinherited scares them THAT badly. Oh, and that line where Joyce rides Kenya on her home's ""makeover""... talkin' about how her home now looks like a ""Bordello in Bangkok"".  I also have a question for Joyce (played by Alfre Woodard) Umm, unless you had to drag your husband or son OUT of one...how would you know what such a place looks like from the INSIDE? Seems like if ANYBODY needed to ""let go and let flow""...it was Joyce, more than Kenya!

2525848,5,B000EOTTUY,"While reviewing movies in which Simon Baker stars or appears, I came across Something New and have now watched it 3 times. Other reviewers have talked about lack of chemistry but I found it there between these two people. The movie raises the age old questions of how we possibly come together as humans and form lasting bonds, how we overcome prejudices that can run deep on both sides of racial divisions, how women and men deal with the expectations of others--and find the connections that give their lives meaning. One quibble - landscape architects, who receive several years of professional schooling, are trained more as engineers than  landscapers. They deal with hardscape such as septic systems, water abatement, and building codes set by municipal, state and federal entities. While some LAs enjoy gardening and may have done or do landscape installations,they are not landscapers. It looks like Simon Baker's character is a landscaper. In the end it doesn't matter. People are able to get past the ""he's the help"" thinking! Each of us who works is the ""help"" to someone.",1454025600,,1083,4.983425414364641

2525851,5,B000EOTTUY,I like this movie because it does point out what African Americans go through and it takes an insightful person to see pass the barriers and not let it hinder the relationship.,1453334400,,176,4.53125
2525852,5,B000EOTTUY,This movie is really good and for me i can relate to it. I like how we are able to see both main characters growth throughout the film.,1452643200,,135,3.857142857142857
2525853,3,B000EOTTUY,"If you like movies where a man is desperately, earth-shakingly in love with a woman who is a jerk, boring and has nothing to offer, then this is the movie for you. Personally I found it unbelievable, and not in the suspend disbelief kind of way but in a way that was a turn off and did not make me identify with the protagonist all that much or even sympathize with her.

The other aspect is that pretty much no one listens to or respects what the protagonist wants and has to say. She has a succesful career, a job she loves, she bought her first house and yet everyone treats her like some defective because she isn't paired up. She is not interested in dating, yet everyone tries to hook her up with a man, any man,  because god forbid a woman doesnt have a man at that age, even if it is not the right one for HER.  She has an idea of what her ideal man should be like and what she looks for in a man, and she is belittled as being unrealistic, out of touch and too demanding. She is asked to not have requirements so she can have somebody anybody.  She is not interested in Simon Baker's character, yet he keeps imposing on and stalking her until she gives in etc.

And then why he falls in love with her: if you figure it out please do share because I could not, for one second, figure out why a man would insist on pursing a woman who is dull, boring and rude. And we are supposed to find it endearing. In actuality.

The fact that they do not have any chemistry did not help. Thematically this was a movie that had a lot of potential with respect to exploring interracial relationships but it fell flat on all fronts and delivered a lot of cliches. Like when one of her friends says that he is a good guy and different than other white guys, what does that mean? How is he different? What makes him acceptable? The fact that he is willing to date a black woman?

I give this three stars because while entertaining, it really missed the mark and the main two leads have pretty much zero chemistry. I personally have very little use for movies where people just fall deeply, madly in love at the drop of a hat and for no apparent reason other than it is romantic.  This move is without substance.",1452470400,,2202,4.201421800947867

Simon Baker and Sanaa Lathan are excellent as is Taraji P. Henson in a supporting role.
Mike Epps has a small role but an important one.

2525878,3,B000EOTTUY,"Didn't enjoy this film very much. Good acting, but there's a scene in there where she and her brother watch an erotic dance show with her parents. I also don't enjoy the objectification of men by the ladies in the film, but I do like that they branch out and decide that their perfect man doesn't have to fit a certain mold. Sanaa and the lead male convince me that they are in love. I would skip through this whole movie just to watch one scene, and it's the ballroom dance scene. SPOILER ~The other scene when she has dinner with her parents and new boyfriend, and the scenes leading up to her breaking up with him are worth watching.~ END OF SPOILER
Other than that, the scene in the grocery store and her treatment of the lead actor can be painful to watch. I don't know if it's a realistic portrayal of what interracial couples sometimes encounter, or if Kenya was just mean. I understand her upbringing had a lot to do with her behavior, but in my opinion she takes too long to get to the place Brian is : open to fall in love with someone with a different ethnic background. Expect some stereotypes, and language. It could have been a better movie.",1434758400,,1155,4.351851851851852

He doesn't like to watch movies that don't have good reviews. (a certain percentage cut off of tomatoes...) :/
I bought this, and, I liked the fact that when I purchased it, it came with a free 24-hr rental of the digital copy.

After the movie was over, we had a very real discussion about race, especially since we have an age difference as well. He likes the movie, and the fact that the characters are complex. You will laugh, yell, and cry at the screen. He ended up crying at one part!

In this particular relationship, it was interesting that the male Caucasian did not seem to have concerns about color...or did not let it stand in his way....and I think that is an important thing to note. Sometimes we're the ones with the prejudice...and we don't even realize it. When she let all her hang-ups go and let love happen, color became irrelevant...Love it!!",1423872000,,535,4.955555555555556

2526009,5,B000EOTTUY,"I bought this movie because it has Simon Baker in it [I have to be honest].  I've watched plenty of romantic comedies over the years, and with each one comes the inevitable rolling of the eyes by the boyfriend. Romantic comedies always have the same recipe.  Girl meets boy, they don't like each other, then they fall in love, then get married or some other happy ending.  They are light fare movies.  They are amusing and don't invoke much thought.  I am a thriller movie kind of person, but we all need a romantic comedy every once in a while, so I do have quite a few of them on my shelf.  This movie was ""something new"" to me.  Sure, it does have the romantic comedy steps [it did make me laugh], but it is different. It is a fun movie, but it's also thought provoking.  All my other romantic comedies are on the shelf collecting dust since I got this movie. It is a movie about an interracial relationship.  The main woman character [Sanaa Lathan] is serious, reserved, and not easily willing to accept new things.  She has a long unbending list of things that ""Kenya doesn't do,""  and is looking for what she/friends/family consider to be the ""perfect"" man. The main male character [Simon Baker], is a fun loving, laid back character that has no qualms about doing something unconventional in others eyes, such as an interracial relationship.  The movie starts off as I suspected, but then I was surprised.  It has to do with friend/family pressures the woman faces, and the unrelenting uncompromising resistance towards Simon Baker's character by friends and family. Not only does it bring this issue up regarding an interracial relationship, it brings up the issue of discrimination in the workplace and how she deals with it.  She [Kenya] has a difficult time dealing with these issues, but he [Brian]  doesn't think about these issues in a serious way.  He doesn't want to discuss these issues, she does...and all this comes to a head.  In walks ""the perfect man,"" and she enters that relationship because, according to her, friends, and family, he is the one she SHOULD be with.  After this happens, she does end up coming to the conclusion that what's important is how you feel about someone, and how that person treats you is what's important.  There is good chemistry between the two main characters, and there is sexual attraction portrayed that most romantic comedies don't address. Kudos to this movie for having substance, and I will watch it 100 more times.",1393200000,3,2476,4.716279069767442

2526018,5,B000EOTTUY,"I'd be willing to bet that I am the oldest person reviewing this movie.

This is the best romantic comedy made since 1940. And, unlike most of the genre, it's relevant to more than an infinitesimal fraction of the population. The ratio of pain to payoff is perfect. Sanaa is a wonderful actress--one who will become as good as Streep--persuading us in every early scene that she is wound up too tight, like a guitar string that is going to snap in the next five minutes.

You can get many synopses without me.  Some of them, I'm sure, are doozies. Good luck. And don't miss this movie.",1389916800,,585,4.4485981308411215
2526029,5,B000EOTTUY,I love this movie remembered it and purchased a rental since I couldn't find in the Redbox or Comcast On Demand.,1389916800,,112,4.380952380952381
2526030,5,B000EOTTUY,This is a great movie!  It is a good story line.  The actors did a great job dealing with an issue that is not always talked about.,1389830400,,131,3.814814814814815
2526031,4,B000EOTTUY,"As you can probably guess by the picture, it's about a black woman, Kenya, dating a white man, Brian.  Forget the other guy in the picture, there's not much of love triangle going on.

Kenya is somewhat of an uptight, highly successful and well-paid, professional woman who is setup on a blind date with landscape architect, Brian.  She is dismayed to find that Brian is white.

The move portrays some of the issues that people in interracial relationships have to deal with, such as comments and attitudes from friends, family and society.  But most importantly, it portrays how they choose to deal with those comments and attitudes.  I thought, for the most part, that the issues were handled fairly well and examined in an entertaining, yet thought provoking manner.

The only thing I didn't like about the movie was Kenya's attitude toward race.  I felt that someone with her educational and economic background should have built up much more of an immunity to the prejudices she has to face, especially in the workplace.  Kenya seems to be a bit too sensitive.  She was dismissive to Brian, almost to the point of rudeness, when she first met him,  and was extremely uncomfortable just being seen with him in a public place on their blind date.  Although she handles a situation superbly at work, she continues to let an incident, which she perceived to be racial affront, get under her skin.  We all know racism still exists, and when there's a blatant egregious act, we sometimes need to take appropriate actions to deal with it, but for the other, more minor issues, most people, especially those in the professional workplace, have learned to give people the benefit of the doubt and not allow a few idiots to get to us.  Also, there were a few scenes where she got disproportionately upset with Brian because he asked about her hair.  There's also another scene where she gets caught in the rain, and screams, ""My hair!"" while trying to run for cover ... really.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it entertaining.  Other than some of Kenya's reactions, the movie didn't try to hard to be about an interracial couple, but just a love story about two people, with some interesting differences.",1389657600,,2218,4.794736842105263
2526032,5,B000EOTTUY,"I give this movie five stars, as it pushed the parameters of how to view interracial dating.  Typically it is seen and acknowledged that African-American men will date outside of their nationality, while it isn't as widely recognized that African-American women can, do or should date outside of their ethnicity.  In addition, another scope of the movie is that a Caucasian man would be interested in dating AND marrying an African-American woman, an idea that can potentially warrant a great deal of criticism.  In this movie, it encourages the fact that as human beings, we are not so different from one another, no matter what background we come from and can love whomever we choose.  As media is a very influential art form, this movie can do well with educating and guiding others about the realities of this changing world in a positive direction.  I recommend that any single person or couple view this film as a good movie to check out or a fun film for date night.",1389484800,,973,4.733727810650888
2526033,3,B000EOTTUY,"If you're looking for a fun and satisfying romance, Something New fits the bill. The evolution of the romance between the two characters is realistic and the acting was adequate. Simon Baker, though, could have been in more scenes, though, to flesh out his characterization and balance his role as a lead. Overall, the characters are likeable and the film is satisfying as a romantic comedy.",1389398400,,391,4.9393939393939394

2526051,4,B000EOTTUY,"Back when this movie originally released, I turned on the TV and saw an interview with the cast. I had't heard anything about the film until that point, but I was smitten by the way actors Simon Baker and Sanaa Lathan interacted with one another. I thought they had a very cool chemistry, and made the decision to see the movie.

As it turned out, I was a little disappointed in on-screen Kenya and Brian. Maybe it was dialogue, some choppy scene transitions, but they lacked the spark I remembered so clearly from the actor interviews. Even so, this is one of my comfort movies now.

I know this movie was meant to discuss racial issues within society, but I also thought there was some good story-telling in regard to class. While Kenya leaves her comfort zone to date a white man, one of her best friends leaves her comfort zone to date what she originally called 'a uniform and a nametag'.

Of course, this is a sweet romance and the end result is not unexpected. Some of my favorite parts involved Kenya interacting with her girlfriends, and I can't go without mentioning her father. I LOVED her dad! He's that dad who calls on Valentine's Day, who supports and nurtures and gives advice without resorting to lectures. One of my favorite screen-dads ever, I think.",1385856000,,1269,4.606194690265487

Kenya reminds me of my self a little bit, her and I are kinda uncomfortable about stepping outside the box and just living life without having so many rules lol!

Kenya is a corporate woman who is upset with her life at work because of her brown skin she is over looked by her millionaire clients. Her home life is extremely structured and boring, she surrounds herself with work until a landscaper is suggested to her knocks on her door. With her standard life and his open mind and free spirit and the fact that he is white makes Kenya uneasy.

It takes sometime to break down her shell but she falls in love!!

I'm kinda upset at some of the reviews on this movie, people have the right to thier own opinion but I disagree with people saying Kenya's charater was racist or the movie itself was racist .. REALLY?!? I thought the exact opposite. I dislike ignorant un-useful reviews.

Aside from being thoroughly mesmerized with his romanticism, Baker delivered a serious story message with class.

2526123,5,B000EOTTUY,"This love story about a driven black executive (Kenya) and a white down to earth landscaper (Brian) takes a unique approach to romance across racial lines. Kenya (Sanna Lathan) and Brian (Simon Baker, in his best film role) are an unlikely match for each other. Kenya has a list of what she wants in a man and her adherence to this list has rendered her dateless. One of her co-workers sets her up on a blind date with Brian. Kenya, who never imagined the blind date could be with a white man, is flustered and escapes as fast as she can. The same co-worker is about to get married and throws a party to celebrate. While there with her girlfriends, Kenya admires the landscaping and is taken aback when the landscaper turns out to be Brian. Brian isn't on Kenya's list because he doesn't have a high power job and he's not black. Brian, on the other hand, doesn't see Kenya as a black woman, he sees her as a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, Kenya is under a lot of pressure from her parents to find an upscale black man to marry. The development of Brian's love for Kenya, her struggle to overcome her conflicted feelings for Brian and her desire to please her parents make this a thoughtful, compelling and tender movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good romance and would like to see interracial relationships dealt with outside of the box they are usually put in.",1356048000,,1382,4.50996015936255
2526124,5,B000EOTTUY,"So ... I am a little late to this party.  I remember hearing about this movie on Oprah when it first came out six years ago, but I blew it off because it almost seemed trite.  On vacation recently, I finally relented to curiosity and watched the movie.  I was blown away.

I was unexpectedly moved.

As a brief introduction to the film, the lead character is a successful, upper middle-class African-American female senior manager, and up for partner, in a high-profile accounting firm.  At the beginning of the movie, she laments - along with her equally successful, single black female friends - her single status.  They briefly note the statistic that 42.4 percent of black women have never married.  So, the ladies subscribe to the mantra ""let go, let flow"" as they try to let go of lists and be more welcoming to love with an Ideal Black Man (IBM).  But instead of an IBM in walks Brian (Simon Baker) as a hunky, blond, almost beachboy-like lanscaper.  And soon Kenya is conflicted between following her heart to choose love or her head to choose an IBM.

So, I will say upfront that there are obvious challenges in the film.  At times, the director stages the actors in ways that are not only awkward, but also frustrating.  There is a very touching scene where Brian comes to Kenya, with his heart in his hands he tells her how he feels about her.  Unfortunately, it was terribly staged so it was actually hard to see each character's reactions in that scene.  And there are times when the script feels frustratingly underdeveloped.  I would have loved for Kenya and Brian to have SOMETHING in common from which to build.  I am not really a fan of opposites attract stories.  Perhaps if they discovered commonalities, then I would have believed that they fell in love due to a soul connection versus just from physical attraction.

But, that's being picky.  And when you are watching a Romantic Comedy, you shouldn't really be that picky.  I would say there is probably only one Romantic Comedy that really gets it right on all notes [""When Harry Met Sally""].  But I love other movies like ""Pretty Woman"" just as much because the storyline is good enough and the quality of the acting elevates them both to great. ""Something New"" is in the ""Pretty Woman"" category for me ... not perfect but gosh near perfect for me.

The cast really is pitch perfect for this film.  I recall one reviewer wondering how Gabrielle Union and Matthew McConaughey would have done.  I had to laugh at that.  Gabrielle is great and she certainly has the poise but Sanaa brings a subtlety to this performance that is underappreciated.  Similarly, to be honest, I think Simon Baker is hands down a better male actor.  Matthew, sweet as he seems in his romantic roles, plays lead loverboy without depth and delicacy.  Baker, on the other hand, infuses his character Brian with a gentle, guileless, and earthy soulfullness that really impressed me.

You have to believe that Brian is sexy, guileless, innocent, and takes all of the abuse from Kenya's friends/family without a lot of silent patience. Yeah, clearly this too-good-to-be-true guy was written by women, but Baker gave him qualities that actually made him seem real.  Interestingly, Simon Baker is actually Australian, which we can easily forget since he plays so many American characters.  He, as Brian, is the right note of easy going without being (too much) of a doormat, assertive without being pushy, and loving without being wimpering.  With a lesser actor, all of that would have fallen apart.  And we finally get to see him finally pushback on Kenya in a somewhat awkwardly staged but necessary fight scene in a grocery store.  Brian is definitely not a pushover.

Put Lathan and Baker together and there is great chemistry. I mean, undeniable and hot chemistry between the main characters.  That's what I loved about ""Pretty Woman"" and here it is again for me.  It is more than their obvious individual hotness.  I suppose it is the undefinable crackle you feel between them and looking at them.  It's wonderful and is what makes the idea that they fell in love believable.  Good acting and great chemistry can get you through almost any script!

Perhaps it's Baker's gentleness as Brian that makes his assertive, passionate, and yes generous, sexual encounters with her all the more sexy.  Who knew gentle, soulfull Brian could be such a wonderful and exciting lover, knowing how to give this women - who does not yet even fully know herself - exactly what she needs in and out of the bedroom.  Ladies?  Come on now.  You know that hall scene was FANTASTIC!  That is what really made me say ... oh wow, he's a hunk.

The supporting cast is wonderful as well, especially the underemployed Wendy Raquel Robinson, Mike Epps, and Earl Billings.  Each plays their respective characters with believeability, heart, and reflectiveness.  They are not useless side characters.  They are well-rounded friends and family that actually add to the story versus distracting from it.

The discussions of race in the movie were interesting and timely.  It is true for some communities of black women and so is timely and appropriate.  And for a romantic comedy to take on, with a respectful level of dignity and fairness, the racial challenges one may face with interracial dating from a black woman's perspective is certainly something new.  I was very impressed with that.

Yes, there were some things that seemed exaggerated.  The way Kenya blew Brian off when she first met him because he was white was crazy.  The race-based fight in a grocery store seemed a little forced.  And some of her friends' rude comments to Brian felt a little over the top.  But they did highlight some real questions.  How can I let go of my pre-conceived notion of what race the man of my dreams will be?  How can I communicate with my partner about racial issues even when he may not relate to everything I say?  How do I deal with rude friends who may disrespect my non-black partner due to his race?

These aren't exactly easy questions to answer and I think it was actually better that the movie didn't try to give simple answers to complex issues that might depend on the couple and their temperments.

But I think part there are parts of the discussion that are missing.  Much of the rifts you see between Kenya and Brian are not necessarily racial differences but CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, and GENDER differences.  Culture: There is a cringe-worthy scene where Kenya appears embarrassed and upset when Brian asks her about her weave.  Economic: A couple of times, her friends call him ""a gardener,"" highlighting the class difference.  Even he notes the money-making difference between them during a fight.  Gender: I know of NO MAN who wants to address serious issues when he is not in that headspace.  It seemed that she didn't really know how to communicate with a man that would make him feel appreciated and respected for his boundaries.

Yeah the racial stuff is there.  But there were times where I felt like she was not really as interested in talking about race as she was in feeling validated.  Note a short scene where she basically agrees with her black date on the ""black tax"" idea and there was no further discussion.  Parallel that to the scene with Brian where they spent more time arguing about talking about race than she did even talking about it with the other guy.  Interesting.  In the end, doesn't it all come back to wanting to be loved and understood for who you are?

And turnaround is fairplay.  Kenya needed to appreciate Brian more.  She never seemed to give any thought to how the poor guy might feel about her rejecting him (multiple times) because of his race.  Not only her; some of her friends and family were subtley rude to him several times.  She only addressed that once and it would have been nice for her to give some thought to how he might feel about it.

At the end of the day, these comments are compliments.  It's a film where there is plenty of room for growth within the characters and discussion for the audience.

The filmmakers (director, writer, producer - all black females) obviously put much love and care into making this film.  It is seen throughout.  From the wonderful use of lighting to the wardrobe choices, color is used to help tell the story.  Brian enters wearing either warmly reddish colors or earthy colors.  The clothes reflects his earthy, soulfullness calmness.  And reinforces how he seems to go with the flow and yet challenge Kenya to change her flow without any manipulation or hidden agendas.  Kenya's colors change as she changes.  With Brian's encouragement, she introduces more pinks and reds and shows her sexy, earthy, vibrant side - along with her natural hair. And he helps her bring more color onto her nails, into her home, especially with painting her walls together, and of course into her backyard.  And metaphorically, he brings color into her heart.

The lighting reinforces the color theme as well.  There is a sensual dance scene where colors are used to highlight Kenya's own desire for livliness and sensuality in her life.  Additionally, there are a couple of scenes (e.g. the post-coital bedroom scene) where they are lit in such a way that their skin colors almost match.  And during the aforementioned fight scene, the lighting is so bright and saturated that Kenya almost looks white-washed, which was a very sneakily clever effect.  Very very well done.

Overall, a movie for me does not have to be perfect.  It just needs to evoke emotion.  I certainly felt emotions with this film and I felt very moved.  I felt the love between the characters, the chalk and the clay building their foundation of love.  I felt happy to see their story and excited to see their sexual chemistry.  Mostly, I felt sad to see it end.  I hope in time this movie gets its due.  It is something wonderful.",1355443200,10,9903,4.739894551845342

2526130,5,B000EOTTUY,"It would be a good thing if folks made more meaningful movies like this that address the real deal with what's going on in the world. Relationships between black women and white men are not ""new,"" it's been going on since Africa and early American times ... not all interracial relationships were forced intimate contacts. However, this movie was new for the movie industry and it would do well to come up with more atypical works that are deep, adult, somewhat risque ... and more like this and ""It's Complicated.""

Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker do an excellent job of bringing the heat and making it count for two memorable performances that brought down the house.

Traditionally, black women have been remarkably loyal to black men, even to their own detriment in many cases ... but that is becoming less so as time moves on and forward. There are risks in interracial dating, but there are even more risks in never finding ""Mr Right"" if the mind is closed off to possibilities that may not match the ideals we've been taught to have based on past limitations.

My favorite line was the older gentleman who played ""Kenya McQueen's"" father saying ""We're all mixed up. A nation of mutts. Besides, the boy's just white...ain't like he's a martian or anything like that...""

Superb words: A Nation of Mutts.

A big fan of Simon Baker, I would have to say this is his best movie role to date.  (He was also good in 'The Devil Wears Prada,' but he played a not-so-good guy and  was not in a starring role.)  Here, he does have a lead role of which he's worthy, playing an average working guy who is out of his league in a new, inter-racial relationship.  It is interesting to watch him play a character in such a vulnerable position, the outsider.

All of the cast is wonderful, especially the always funny Donald Faison, the incomparable Alfre Woodard, the impecable Earl Billings, and the smooth and handsome Blair Underwood.  The chemistry between the two leads, the attractive Sanaa Lathan and the very sexy Simon Baker is credible, simmering until it reaches a slow sizzle.  The dialogue is smart, witty, believable.

2526136,4,B000EOTTUY,"Really enjoyed this movie.  I felt the key characters were believable.  Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker had a nice chemistry between them.  Their relationship moved slowly and smoothly throughout the film.  For some, interracial relationships can be difficult.  In this day and time, one wouldn't think so, but it can be.

This film showed how others can prevent a possibly good relationship between interracial couples, from possibly happening.  Sanaa struggled with this, even to the point of hiding it.  Some have their beliefs about not going out of their own race.  Sanaa had it as well.  When it boils down to it, we are all humans, male and female.  Race shouldn't be an issue, even though it is for some.

I think in the end that Sanaa decided to follow her own heart, though almost losing Simon for good.  She had to oversome some of her beliefs toward interracial relationships, and allow her true feelings to conquer her fears.  Also, to realize that this is her life, and her happiness is what truly matters.  Don't lose this person because they are a different race than you.",1339977600,,1085,4.758064516129032

2526144,4,B000EOTTUY,"This movie is very good ice breaker for interracial dating.  It addresses topics that are of concern, but ppl are hesitate to bring up on their own.  I do think successful or not, black women should open up that dating pool and ""let go, let flow.""  We can be our own worst enemies.  Im not saying you should just date a person because their a different race.  That makes you superficial & I have disdain for individual's like that. Take your list of qualities & attrabutes & apply them to the guy/girl you meet regardless of race.

Review of your list & recognize what is a deal breaker & what is cosmetic.  A deal breaker might be ""I don't want kids.""  Well if you know you want kids, don't be with that person.  Somethings cosmetic would be ""I want someone who works out everyday.""  Ok, thats a little unrealistic, because most ppl don't work out.  How about meeting in the middle & getting with someone who works out, encourage them to increase their days of activity.

In addition to that, if your partner of another race tells you about how they're being treated, listen.  Perhaps their reason for their mistreatment is because of their race.  And perhaps you haven't had that encounter because you may be from the majority race.  Just because its 2011, doesn't mean racisim doesn't exsist; its just done with a little more finesse.

Kenya's dad draws a great comparison when he's comforting her - he says ""what you had with brian was real. besides its like the boy is from another planet...he's just white."" ""Everybody carries on like we're some pure race, but we're all mixed up.""",1320192000,2,1587,4.594306049822064

Aside from the part of the conversation about how hot Simon Baker is AND how hot his character is in this movie, we've discussed how the heart wants what the heart wants. This movie was definitely about different races and how they do and don't get along when dating and romance is thrown in, but it was done in such a way that the point came across without the viewer getting beat over the head with it.

They were working man's sox but seemed way too new. Still, very charming. A nice touch.) My only caveat was that Sanaa's character, Kenya, was not developed enough to understand the attraction Brian had for her beyond the physical. More should have been made, perhaps, of her father's stint as a doctor in Africa helping poor people - some conversation would have been useful that showed Kenya shared his values, which would have matched Brian's and nailed down his attraction to her.

Kenya is a little uptight and Brian is a free spirit who believes people should be themselves. Because of that belief, Kenya is able to open up a bit more and blossom into something of a free spirit herself.

I especially love the scene in which Kenya realizes she loves Brian and runs to get her man before it's too late.

To me, this is not a movie in which you hope she will choose the white man or the black man. This is a movie in which you hope she will choose THE MAN that she loves and will be happy with. In the end, that's all that matters anyway.

2526158,5,B000EOTTUY,"I am not sure that I got the same thing out of the film that everyone else did.  I am mulatto.  So my opinion is the opinion of a mulatto observer.

  I really liked this film, and I do believe that it is, in some aspects, very realistic.  The thing that I found the most interesting in the film is that it not only depicts racism, but the movie bravely portrays the problems with reverse racism.  The main character in this film is extremely racist (Kenya) and she does not know it.  She treats Brain, her white boyfriend, with contempt in many scenes within the movie.  She is unfair to him and blames him for the bad experiences that she has had with other white people in her life. The development in this movie comes when Kenya comes to terms with her own racism and stops projecting outward the feelings that she has herself. Everyone has to behave the way that they would like people to behave.

  Brain is an educated man in a lower social class than the girl he is trying to date.  His low status is displayed realistically.  He is treated in an inferior manner because of his job--despite his his good character. He displays the most mature behavior of any character in the movie.  He is completely untouched by racism even though he does not always understand the social implications.  As a character, he is not a saint.  He is ignorant of the damaging experience that black women experience on a daily basis, but he tries to understand. This character is probably the most beautiful that I have ever watched in any film; he tries.  He is also extremely patient in the face of mistreatment, refuses to complain if he thinks it is nonconstructive, and looks constantly for the positive in the situation.  He is an enlightened person and he does not have the status of a professional class job.

  Kenya is anxious, very serious, and needs help handling stress.  She is very competent and hard working.  This is the first movie that I have ever seen in which the heroine is stressed for legitimate reasons.  She is an over-achiever with an under developed personal life. She lacks interpersonal skills and suffers from unrealistic fears.  She also does not know how to express her feelings so she attempts to hide her emotions behind a facade of social propriety. She appears as a boring person, but is very intriguing underneath the flat way that she projects herself because of her own feelings of inferiority.  She suppresses herself because of the way that her self-esteem has been damaged by her white co-workers and the way that she believes other people perceive her. She does not see the positive in her life because she is over sensitive. This is an extremely realistic portrayal of an intelligent woman that faces adversity; the character displays common errors in thinking. I have also never come across a film in which the female had a serious relationship with her family.  We usually get the orphaned heroine, but in this film all family members are alive and talking.  That is unusual.

  What I found to be less realistic is the cruel manner in which the blacks in this film treat a white man.  I grew up in an interracial neighborhood.  On the block that I lived most of my life on, four families had marriages that were interracial, and all those families had children.  All their children also grew up to have children with either black or white spouses.  Black people are often racist, but they are not so racist that they will insult a white partner at social events.  That is extremely rude, and the cruel manner that Brain is treated by blacks, in my experience, is not realistic.  It is a little extreme.  I do not think that this detracts greatly from the film because the movie is pointing out a genuine difficulty-- even if it is an over dramatized one.

  The board has a very interesting discussion on it.  I just wonder if some of this controversy is not generational.  I am a twenty-five year old mulatto female, and I have had problems with racism in relationships before, but the circumstances are different from in this movie (different religions or political beliefs).  I have two kids from white fathers, and I was married to a white man.  Interracial marriages are not that taboo anymore.  My generation barely bats an idea at this type of thing so I am not sure why this heroine is agonizing over a relationship with a very kind and attractive man.  I cannot understand the scandal here. People have issues around race, but it seems not to be so much of a factor in regard to who they are going to date.  If anything, this is an old controversy.",1265241600,22,4592,4.596059113300493

You feel like you hardly get to know the characters or their surroundings very well, and the main romantic pairing seems a little forced, but in spite of that, most of the characters and the settings are pleasant and comfortable enough to make this a relatively enjoyable movie. I felt that at points, the racial issues were a bit forced and tiresome, but in the end it all sort of works out in a happy way. I wish the Kenya character would have had a bit more obvious attraction than just looks for the Brian character. She never seems to be anything other than a stressed, reclusive hard-charger.

2526175,3,B000EOTTUY,"I remember getting psyched about this movie, a feel good comedy and a sophisticated interracial romance ? too good to be true, and i was very much hoping it would move past the typical stereotypes, and in some ways it did.

Generally i like Sanaa Lathan , and i was hoping this movie would move past the ""overworked, undersexed, professional stuck up"" black woman stereotype, (the other one is the ""loud  mouth , oversexed, ghetto hood rat"".

well on that note it delivered, kenya is not loveable to say the least, not at first anyway, now she is a seasoned professional, an accountant at a big firm,her life is her work, she has a beautiful home and she is holding her own,  so why would she be so rude to Brian on the blind date, based on him being white? i mean even if i was adverse to dating white guys , i would not be rude like that.  as usual... the black female does not get to be ""fun"" or even ""tolerant"".

her friends are no better, at a valentines day girl get together they lament over the statistics, 42% of black women will never marry, or something to this effect, that being said, they are ALL professionals, a judge, a pediatrician, an accountant, etc. so why in god's name are they so ignorant about her dating Brian.

""he is a white boy"" "" did you really think it was gonna lead to anything"", it was really disheartening to me, it paints black women as being shallow and ignorant on that front.

i would not expect professionals to say things like this. Brian is constantly put to the test by Kenya's friends being called "" anight light"" and "" she is getting her swirl on"" to "" he is a spy sent her to steal my recipe"" haha, funny right, not to me. they also don't explore any apprehension from brian's side of the camp, it's only kenya's pretentious family we get to see in action.

so did i like the movie yes, i felt brian and kenya had great chemistry after she finally let her guard down, i d idnt like how she had to be this hard stuck up bourgeouise type of woman thru the first 2/4s of the movie, i think his acting was great, i like how in the end her family and friends accepted him and she let herself be loved.",1237420800,6,2142,4.243243243243243

One can see why Alice Walker recommended it!! Good writing, believeable characters and an appealing duo of Latham & Baker make this one more watchable than any of Perry's movies. You will not see any buffoonery here or stereo-type characters that you would find in Tyler's films.  These are sophiscated, urban class characters and for once my intelligence was not insulted!! There have been very few comedies that approach this subject without sensationizing it or being condescending about it (Lee's terrible ""Jungle Fever"", for instance).

2526186,5,B000EOTTUY,"I just adore Sanaa Lathan.  Maybe that's why I just had to see this movie.  After watching her chew up the screen in `Love and Basketball' I think I'd find any excuse to watch her (I did see `AVP').  Thankfully Lathan is not the only good thing about `Something New'; in fact the entire film was well constructed and it delivers a nice and satisfying slice of entertainment.

The film focuses on the very successful Kenya McQueen, a corporate lawyer who has fought her way to the top and just keeps on fighting to get higher.  All that fighting has had an adverse effect on her love life, leaving her single and in need of some male attention.  When a friend and co-worker sets her up on a blind date she ends up getting more than she bargained for in Brian Kelly.  He's good looking, successful and charming; but he's also white, and Kenya doesn't `do' white guys (there's a whole list, trust me).  After rudely turning him away she winds up being reacquainted with him when she inquires about having her backyard landscaped.

Guess what Brian does for a living.

It's obvious that sparks will fly and that the two of them will start a relationship.  It's also obvious that her family will disapprove (not only is he white but they are wealthy and it's obvious that Kenya's mother puts a lot of value in social standing).  It's predictable that race will become and issue and they will break up and Kenya will pursue the black man only to realize that regardless of skin color she loves Brian and needs to be with him.  All of this is predictable yet what isn't predictable or `obvious' is the fact that we will care so much.  Brian is such a sweet and charming guy, and Kenya is such a confused and sheltered person that we are rooting for them to complete one another.  We are rooting for Kenya to lose Brian so she can appreciate him and visa versa.

Sanaa Lathan doesn't disappoint me here.  She plays Kenya with dedication and naturalism (she reminds me so much of my wife here; all those beautiful flaws).  Simon Baker is another standout.  As Brian he really understands his character, but he also understands Kenya.  It's obvious why one would fall for him; he's a complete package.  I thought that Mike Epps turned in a great supporting performance as well.  Donald Faison is non other than Donald Faison (he really only has one shade of character) and Blair Underwood comes off a little creepy to me (that might be because I was rooting for him to fail and for Brian to `get the girl').  Alfre Woodard and Earl Billings do a nice job of representing two different sides of a parent.  As Kenya's mother, Alfre is intrusive and controlling, but as her father, Earl is gentle and understanding.  They compliment each other very well.

`Something New' may not be all that `new' but in a few aspects it truly is.  It approaches the race relations issue in a non-biased, realistic and, most importantly, likable way, a way that proves that in the end race doesn't matter; especially in matters of the heart.  As long as you're happy, as long as you're in love then it doesn't matter what your color is on the outside; the same color blood is pumping through all of our veins.",1206316800,9,3180,4.521891418563923

In addition to the movie's romantic theme, Lathan shows her comedic chops.  The funniest scene is when Lathan's character - having just met Baker's character in a blind date set-up at a Magic Johnson/Starbucks JV (excellent touch by director Sanaa Hamri) - tries to assert her street cred on the way to a table by loudly asking questions of the employees like ""How's Magic treating you, brother?""

This is a ""free"" country and people should be allowed to freely be with who they fall in love with. Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker did a great job portraying this couple in this heartwarming movie.  I think there should be a sequel to this to movie (with the same cast) to show how this couple is doing.  It's a wonderful love story and the entire cast made it work!  It was easy to watch and very believable.  Kudos to the writer, director, Sanaa Hemri, lead actors, Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker, and the entire cast for a movie well done! The romance and humor was well balanced. I live in a college town in Michigan and I have watched Something New both alone and with a group of viewers of different professional backgrounds and races.

But I decided to rent it, and I was so delighted that I recommend this movie to everyone. You will not regret this sexy, touching, depth-filled comedy! Rent it and see what I mean.

Simon Baker. . . things that make you go ummm. Ok where has this Australian actor been hiding? Baker is the male lead in this romantic comedy, and he just fit into this role perfectly.

Yes this is a movie about an interracial couple. But that's not really the point of this movie at all. This movie beautifully shows how a fulfilling relationship with the right person can help you to grow into your fullest potential. I love that!

One of my favorite scenes is the very sensual setting of Baker putting nail polish on his girls toe nails. I cannot imagine any woman resisting that!

The passion between the characters and the chemistry of the actors just bursts forth.

There are so many levels and elements to this movie; the complexities of relationships, our family dynamics, all of our pre-conceived notions, and what we think may make us happy or not.

Rent this movie, you will think about it deeply, but it will feel effortless.",1187481600,4,1304,4.570815450643777
2526199,5,B000EOTTUY,"I am perplexed by some reductive reviews which try and catagorize this film either as ""chickflick"" or ""interacial romance""--I don't think either catagory does justice to the charm of this film and the subtelty of its observations. The chickflick catagorization seems silly. On the other hand The film certainly probes the vexations that black/white romantic inimacy encounter--as well as the hope that any real intimacy engenders. But it does more. It succeeds in exploring the differences between not only black and white but in exploring the variatons of insight within a group of black people and white people.  For example:  Kenya's girlfriend Cheryl(?) (one problem I  noticed with with my copy was quality of sound)  notices that Kenya has been hiking with Brian and understands that THAT outing is perhaps as important as the night Brian and Kenya subsequently spend together. Kenya's other girlfriends miss that. Small  moment  gracefully done!
Similarly I thought that the nuanced way the film points to the humiliation Kenya suffers at the hands of a white client (Jack?)) who is never on the surface even  ""impolite"" was especially well done and the understated nature of  Jack's prejudice made it all the more painful. But the film also shows the way Kenya is liked by other white characters-- not only by Edwin (who balances out Jack)  but in a small and delightful way by a worker at the firm who tells a depressed Kenya he has a bottle of  Tequilla in his desk. Such touches are testimony to the director and actors. Lathan and Baker are superb; they create real people--in fact the one criticism of the film that I have is that Mark- the Blair  Underwood - character comes off as perhaps two demensional--though I hesitate even here. Perhaps his part  should have been larger but It must be difficult to craft an estimable character who somehow cannot offer what Kenya needs.
Finally the architecture of the film beautifully parallels the landscape architecture in the film-- the way the color red is used throughout the film or even the way a  phrase like  ""no pressure"" is used point to the charm and importance of the film's syntax.
The best film about black/white relations I can think of at the moment is  ""A Family Thing"" with Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones two of the finest living actors--but this film comes real close and is also a love story. As  Simon Baker says in the bonus section--""we need more of those""",1187222400,4,2440,4.843373493975903
2526200,5,B000EOTTUY,"I am a white/Italian man newly married to a super black woman.  We are both in our 40's and working professionals.  We went to see this movie when it came out in the theaters, and then purchased the DVD when it came out.  We both enjoyed the movie very much, I guess for obvious reasons.  It's a positive and uplifting movie.  There simply are not many movies that realistically try to present relationships involving a black woman and a white man---especially this movie which comes at you from the woman's perspective.

Although not perfect, the movie did a very good job portraying the hesitation, uncertainty, obstacles, unknown, pain, awkwardness, and yes, passion, excitement and humor, involved with inter-racial relationships.  Both leading characters were very likeable and believable.  (Who said Sanaa Lathan is not attractive and talented--you've got to be kidding??) Brian and Kenya's first meeting at Starbucks is priceless.  You also just have to smile and laugh at the scenes involving Brian/Kenya and her hair---white men really don't know anything about black women and their hair!!

For me, one of the most telling scenes in the movie is when Brian and Kenya are arguing in the supermarket, and Brain states he does not want to ""talk about race"" that night.  Kenya responds that ""race"" is something black people are forced to deal with every day and every night.  This is something I did not appreciate as a white person until I married a black woman. When you are a black ""minority"" woman in a predominately white male world, you're forced to deal with race everyday, whether you want to or not.  I have found this to be true with my own wife.  Race is always something we are ready to talk about or deal with--but it does not dictate or drive our relationship/marriage.

Lastly, I believe black women--like all women--simply want a man that will treat them well and respect them.  That's all Kenya wants in the movie.  Some black women only want to date black men.  Some black women are open to dating outside their race.  Its all good.  I know that there are many white men who are attracted to and interested in dating black women--but, for many reasons, they are very hesitant and unsure about going ""down this path.""  The world continues to change for the better.  It's not perfect and there is still a long way to go, but I remain optimistic.  Inter-racial relationships are not for everyone, but for some like myself, it is worth the effort.  It was worth the effort for Brian and Kenya.",1185753600,109,2513,4.7772621809744775

Yes it is predictable in places and I would have preferred that the movie not make 'short shrift' of a white person getting a taste of what it means to be 'black in America' even if through the experience of having a black love interest. The movie also leads one to believe that the only people who have a problem with interracial relationships are black people outside of the relationship and seems to give white people a pass.

Those who say that the subject of an interracial relationship is 'nothing new' (in reference to the title) are missing the point. An interracial relationship may be 'nothing new'  to the rest of the world but is something 'very new' and 'very different' to the lead female character's experience.

2526210,5,B000EOTTUY,"I fell in love with this movie from the first time I saw it. It's not just another film with an romantic interracial twist - this time it's told from a female black urban professional's point of view, which you really don't see very much. It could be classified as a light-hearted romantic comedy, and it does have its moments - but it also takes on some heavyweight issues and taboos about race, income and status, and does so very well. Sanaa Lathan, who is an excellent actress, is the main character, Kenya McQueen. She is successful in her career as a high-powered corporate CPA in a mostly white firm and enjoys what she does. But Kenya deep down longs for someone she can share her life with - preferably a man who has a similar upper-middle class background, similar goals - and definitely someone who is black. But her choices seem extremely limited, as are those of her friends, all single black professional women who are looking for love and marriage. It is all too well known that there are fewer black American males than females that are educated and without ""baggage"". So it knocks Kenya for a loop when she finds herself attracted to Brian Kelly (Simon Baker) - the cute and sexy white landscape architect she once had a blind date with (having no idea that he was white). After admiring the landscaping at a friend's engagement party, she learns that it was none other than Brian who was responsible for how beautiful everything looked. Despite her reservations, Kenya hires Brian to transform the backyard of her new home, which she recently purchased. Over time, their business relationship grows personal, and although Kenya is happy in her new romance, she worries about the opinions of her peers and upper middle-class family members.

In this script, perhaps the problems that Kenya and Brian face are solved a bit simplistically, but in its defense, this is a film where the storyline is believable. Many successful, independent sistas in corporate America face the same kind of issues Kenya does - the frustrations involved with having co-workers and employers doubt their abilities merely because of their race and gender, regardless of their Ivy League education - and of course, their romantic choices - Sanaa Lathan nailed it down. She and Simon Baker have a nice, easy chemistry on screen and you find yourself rooting for their characters to get together. You honestly believe that the two of them share something very special, and their love for one another is real. After a while, you don't even care that this is a interracial romance - all you see are two people who love each other, regardless of the odds. My only fault with this film is that I would have liked the screenwriters to give us more info about Brian's life, other than how he got into botany and landscaping - what about his family, his friends and his upbringing? However, this movie is one I can't help but watch time and time again. For anyone who's ever been torn between following their heart and doing what they (and others, mind you) thought was best for them, I highly recommend this.",1174608000,10,3093,4.738404452690167

2526213,3,B000EOTTUY,"Interracial love and class confrontation is told from the black woman's perspective -- and from the perspective of her friends, peers and family -- in ""Something New"", a quality film that takes a new slant on an old topic. Racial issues are also front and center in the pic, although the traditional ideas about love and fulfillment predicatably come to the fore in the film's closing scenes.

Sanaa Lathan playing oddly-named Kenya McQueen -- is this already a tipoff of a story about race and class divisions? -- is the female love interest and star of the show playing a successful accountant in a big New York firm. She comes from a wealthy background -- father a doctor, mother a socialite, sibilings and friends all eminently successful -- and she seems hidebound by the tradition-bound framework of her success.

Enter blind date-landscape architect-boyfrined Brian (Simon Baker) who confuses her further by being attractive while being white, a blue collar professional, a guy whose dogs travels with him and, well, that other race. Conservative Kenya at first resists but later falls under his charm and the racial love story is on. Friends, family and cohorts chime in often on her affair, which takes a predicatable path, then recovers, then turns into a fairy tale at the end.

Some big name actors lend a hand to this tale which is essentially a high class urban love story about people with everything going for them and one obvious conflict. The irony of this situation, it appears, is the inability of Kenya to see the obvious in spite of having everything else in life.

I like this movie and would recommend it to anyone seeking a pleasing urban drama. The director ensures that no one overacts, the script doesn't try to do or say too much, and the perspectives presented are unusual enough to keep the typical love story fresh. In addition, the script makes no one an idiot, lighting is fantastic in every scene (so all the beautiful people look even more beautiful than they are), and the movie goes exactly where any romantic wants it to go.

I saw this movie by chance on HBO and have since watched it several times to catch the nuances (I had to ask my teen son what ""22's"" on a sports car were). The film is so endearing that I ordered the DVD to see it widescreen.  Now THIS is the way to see it. The bonus features on the DVD are a treat too. Also- one can appreciate Simon Baker's American accent in the movie when you see him talking in his normal Aussie style!

But many mixed race movies always show an african-american guy with a white woman, this kind of gives a different view.  I really loved the chemistry between Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker.  He was great in the tv show ""The Guardian"".  To some degree the ending was a little cheesy but women love cheesy endings.  Definitely Hot!",1172534400,2,481,4.6
2526217,2,B000EOTTUY,"I had been hearing and critiques on ""Something New"" and this is the first movie featuring a Black American Women in a realtionship with a White American Man, I did not see the movie because I personally thought  what about movies like 'Eraserhead' or Rosanne Cash and Stacey Keach  in the 1970's or many british movies on the subject. To me this movie seemed like a 'get back' movie at Black Men who either..

1. dating  white women
2. on the dl
3. are irresponsible
4. take black women for granted
5. sexist black men

After people telling me that it's not the case and it's a movie that's not bashing black men but telling black women to seek more options than an ""Ideal Black Man"". I decided to wait until the overhyping of this movie ended by it's female actors, director, and producers and movie critics hailing this movie as a great ' racial breakthrough' (lolol) for Black Women. I have finally seen the movie and my reivew that it's a well acted but predictable romatic drama about the same subject that's starting to plaque black movies in the last 10 years. Black Movies used to feature just ghetto sterotypes are now doing the same thing but it's now the Black Middle or Upper Class who can't find love but usually it's Morris Chestnutt, Taye Diggs, and Jamie Foxx. But unlike those black leading men the 'white knight' is actually white, Simon Barker (land of the dead) is the landscape owner who Sanna Lathan falls for in this predictable romp.

As her friends and others encouarge her to pursue this relationship, her IBM show up in the quise of Blair Underwood (in a solid but wooden performance) Kenya (Lathan) reacess her realtionship with Barker after some friction on race (how typical of hollywood) after Underwood is so driven by his job and not Kenya, the talk of tolerance by her pops and the ending at the cotilion with the Lathan running to Barker at the end (doesn't that scence look like Spiderman 2)with Lathan learning that Black Women should expand their options especially for professional black women.

I could say this movie is some social breakthrough, but there is nothing in this film that is artisitc, there has has been movies that focus on the subject that are better than ""Something New'. If Black Women want to date IR just do it, but don't con me with a film that is average at best, and don't insult my intelligence. Its a chick flick and for Roger Ebert (who is married to a black woman) to say this movie has social impact is insulting to films that have actually done just that. Something New would be a good T.V. movie of the week on LIFETIME but it's not a major motion picture.

P.S. To the Black Women and White Males sending me negative vibes show me a movie about Mixed Realtionships that are better,more realistic than Mississippi Masala than the black female writers and producers 'wet dream' of a movie then I  will believe it. The ending of this movie was unrealistic AT IT'S BEST.In real-life (not kriss turner's fantasy) Black Female/White Male realtionships the couple lives the white male's life and social interests not dancing at predominately black social events Kenya's a black upper class woman in a segregated black elite and would not even consider someone like Brian as part of her social circle or does a 150 years of black elite social conditioning is thrown out the window? Frankly BF/WM are intergrated into mainstream society. Black Women in those relationships are like pro black ballplayers, ""Honoray Whites"" and have all privledges. White Women (or other ethnic groups) who are married to black males are more connected to the Black community than African- American Females married to white males.",1172188800,4,3673,4.717628705148206

I really liked the premise, and thought that both Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker handled their characters with realism and spark.  Sanaa is just a great actress and she relays the right emotions at the right times in just the right ways, I just love watching her act.

The story is about Kenya (Lathan), a successful black woman who is set up on a blind date with Brian (Baker) who she immediately turns down and somewhat rudely lets him know it's because he's white and she's not into that.  She in turn hires him to landscape her backyard and over time falls in love with him, but her constant fear of what others will think keep her at a distance.  She eventually must decide whether to cower to what others expect or follow her heart.

How is it that child can see people for who they are and not the colour of their skin or their ethnicity?  This movie can remind many adults about what is important.

2526226,4,B000EOTTUY,"The great thing about this movie is that it really isn't about the controversy of racism but the truthful facts of it.  That black people can be just as racial as white people.  That there is truth to the `Black Tax' in the American business world and in some cases the assumption of that Tax is generated by paranoia of being judged because they are black.  The fact that some people cannot get past the notion that someone they are set up with is NOT of the same race (not just black or white).  The main message I got from this movie was not just being open to other races, but to something different.  The two characters In the movie are Brian (the white guy) and Kenya (the black woman).  Brian is a former suit and tie exec turned landscape architect.  Kenya is a CPA who is up for promotion to Partner in her firm.  After a shocking and fumbled attempt at a blind date where Kenya panics and ends it abruptly, because she obviously has a problem with him being white, she meets him again at a mutual friends engagement party.  Turns out he did the landscaping and Kenya ends up hiring him to do something with the backyard on her new house.  Brian notices that the interior of Kenya's house is bland and beige.  His desire to get her to try some color and styles starts her on the path of opening her mind.  This lends to getting us to think that this isn't just about going after the person who is the right color but just the right person.  This is really the primary message in the film, hence the title.  See people as people and not races and you gain perspective, objectivity and a better chance at finding the PERSON that is right for you.  Personalities and social beliefs are ingrained by our environment, not by our genetics.  We are (or were) taught by our parents and friends that you should only date someone in your race.  Excuses such as `Inter-racial relationships don't bother me but it's hard on the children' or `It could cause problems with our family or religion'; whatever people.  We're living in the 21st century.  We need to be more culturally diverse.  We need to experience what it's like to have relations with people from other cultures.  Otherwise we will stick ourselves in a rut that will keep us in a social salad bowl where no blending diversification is possible.  But I digress; the movie is very good.  It's romance-drama with some funny moments and some serious water cooler conversation pieces.  Both actors don't seem to be afraid to tackle the issue and they have great chemistry.  Most of the movie is from the perspective of Kenya, the successful black woman, and we get a look at every day black culture, good and bad.  We see her at work, with family and with friends.  All have their pros and cons.  Once the intimate relationship starts between the two, it's only for fun in Kenya's mind.  But as she realizes how much he adds to her lifestyle, she begins to rethink everything.  Wrapping up with something of a Hollywood ending, it's still a good ending.  There is no doubt that the Black-White dating hurdle is still the biggest in America.  This movie would not have been as big a deal if this pairing had been White-Hispanic or Asian-White or German-Indian or French-Pakistani.  Why is that?  There is no easy answer, but maybe the message here can get us closer.  A highly recommended movie with some thought provoking subject matter.",1161302400,3,3393,4.542904290429043
2526227,4,B000EOTTUY,"It is really a completely new approach to an American dream from a perspective an outside world knows near none of the States.

It is a powerful message of what still not-so-highly-advantageous Americans have upon a few last decades achieved, from beneath usual ""only in America"" Cinderella story where Cinderella role was reserved for a simple handsome down-to-earth Anglo-American lad being selected, loved and married by a clever educated socially accepted presumably-financially-independent manager-lady from an Afro-American not-poor-at-all-as-usual-supposed-to-screen family.

Yes, black Americans have their pride and their prejudice-call it racism and one will not be wrong.

I anticipated the typical over the top family and carictature couple, a la ""Guess Who"", and was pleasantly suprised by a smart, well-acted, and totally believeable story. The scene in which Brian asks Kenya the remove her weave almost knocked me out of my chair- had my own husband been a script consultant?? (he hates it when I staighten my  hair) I would have like to have seen more of Brian's perpective, but the story still worked as it was Kenya who had to overcome her issues and her rigid expectations; you got the impression that Brian was a man who knew who he was and what he wanted and simply wouldn't have given a shirt what his family or friends thought.

Aside from the applaudable fact that this film is totally devoid of gansta rap, nudity, or violence, this delightful film provides single African-American sistas still holding out for their ""dream brotha""  with food for thought, but there is a lesson here for men and women of any race seeking any type of relationship. More than just another romantic comedy, this is story about learning how to open your mind and open your heart to experience ""something new"".",1159142400,12,1337,4.585774058577406

For all the SBP women who saw the movie, I know it hit home, whether you agree with the character's situation or not. I totally identified with Kenya and her plight (cotillion, the whole 9 yards). This is a reality for today's black, educated, and professional woman and the movie did an excellent job of sending the ""open yourself up"" message. This is a feel good movie that will have you routing and loving everyone! I've read complaints about there not being enough background on Brian. You all are missing the point. This movie was written, directed, and produced by educated, professional, black women and is about a black woman trying to achieve happiness.

2526232,5,B000EOTTUY,"I read most of the reviews before posting mine and I feel that those who gave the movie one star were being unfair.  Come on people, it's a movie.  You can only fit so much into the plot.  With that said, I think the movie was awsome.  I watched it a few days ago and I'm still thinking about how good it was.  I am in an interracial marriage; my husband is white and from a low social-ecomonic background.  I'm black and from an upper-middle class environment.  We met, fell in love and experienced most, if not all of the conflicts that the main characters in the movie have.  So, all-in-all, I was impressed with the script, dialogue and acting. It was a thoughtful, sweet love story and for a motion picture, it got its point across very well.

Now, for those blasting Sanaa on her looks, you need to go get your eyes checked. She is absolutely beautiful. As for Simon, he is also a very handsome man.

If you're looking for a great movie to watch, this one is it.  The writer did such a great job with character development given her time constraits.  One thing that she should have done was let us in on his friends/family.",1157155200,12,1129,4.3238095238095235

While I saw why and how Bryan weedled his way into Kenya's heart, I never understood from his point of view what he loved about Kenya.  He seemed to be the one doing all the giving and bending over backwards, but I never saw Kenya doing the same from him.  What was it like to be around his parents his friends (did he have friends) and etc?  In that sense the film felt one sided and I didn't buy into the romance as deep as I should have.  Plus, the lead actors, in my opinion, totally didn't have any chemistry.  It pretty much involved her looking pissed off and him being at a loss as to what he did now to piss her off.

2526236,4,B000EOTTUY,"I bought this movie because I saw the two leads being interviewed by Oprah on TV. The show's review just whet my appetite for more.

I enjoy romances where two people from totally different worlds meet, fall in love and then work through the challenges of their different backgrounds. I normally feel that such relationships are stronger, deeper and richer.

As the 'product' of such a marriage myself (my father is Indian and my mom is mixed as well - half Brit, half Portugese), I can understand how difficult it is to 'fit in'. Seeing Simon Baker trying to fit into Saan's world as he tries to strike up conversation with her friends and family reminded me of how uncomfortable my parents used to be around each other's family and friends.

Kudos to the writers, producers and directors of the movie for bringing some of these 'fitting in' issues to light.  All those in mixed relationships will be able to relate.

All said and done, I gave the movie four stars though as I have to agree with another reviewer, the two leads seemed uncomfortable and stiff with each other. The movie is still enjoyable and does make one think. Good stuff all around!",1154736000,3,1153,4.632352941176471

There are certain parts of the movie that I will watch over and over again because of the acting,dialogue,and music. I love watching  Sanaa Lathan. The supporting cast was great. Blair Underwood as usual, lights up any room with his looks. My first time watching Simon Baker (He is a cutie!)  Kenya and Mark (Lathan and Underwood) have all the makings for THE perfect couple, BUT  her heart was somewhere else, and if your heart is not in it, regardless of what society says, you are missing the main ingrediant in a relationship.

2526238,5,B000EOTTUY,"...but it is.  It's rather sad in this day and age that a romantic comedy (which is exactly what this film is) becomes some sort of treatise (in the eyes of the more cynical) on race relations. I have the feeling that much of the discomfort with this film has nothing to do with the film at all, and *everything* to do with our personal ambiguous feelings on interracial relationships, especially interracial relationships featuring black/white pairings.  The first time I saw this film was in a mixed theater on L.A.'s Westside, and the myriad of reactions from the various filmgoers would be a grad thesis in itself.

Don't believe me - think back to all the bruhaha over Halle Berry's and Billy Bob Thornton's love scene in 'Monster's Ball'.

'Something New' does do something refreshing that very seldom happens in American cinema - black characters who transcend the stereotyped images so popular these days.  Kenya (played by the talented and gorgeous Sanaa Lathan) is a lot closer to the reality of black life than what is seen in the media.  There are many upwardly mobile and successful black women in this country (outside of Oprah of course).

As is the staple in many romantic comedies that feature white actors, Kenya's looking for Mr. Right, not knowing that Mr. Right just so happens to be the white landscaper, Brian (Simon Baker, who's just so darn sexy).  The film is as much about the class differences between the white collar Kenya and the blue (or green) collar Brian as it is about their obvious racial differences.

Of course, it's understood that Kenya's idea of the perfect man certainly isn't of the 'caucasian persuasion', and the prerequisite jokes and barbs follow.  Brian, on the other hand, simply sees this highly attractive and intelligent woman who just so happens to be black.

I think the film's most poignant moment (and the one that makes me hit the *replay* button) is when Brian tells her that her natural hair is far more attractive than the fake stuff she's been wearing.  Talk about scoring big points with this 'natural sista'!  My boyfriend (who's Mexican--I'm Black) reached over to me in the theater and ran his fingers through my short crop and whispered ""they got that right"".

And like all romantic comedies, this one wraps everything up in a nice, if not always tidy bow and sends the audience away with the faint hope that we're smart enough to see our shared humanity.  Fluffy in parts, oh yes.  Then again, who said that black films always have to be ghetto-fabulous and heavy-handed?

It did a superb job of presenting both sides of racism from both a black and a white perspective, in a real yet tactful way.

most superb and very tastefully done.  I remember Simon Baker from the ""Guardian"" he was an excellent actor then and is an excellent actor now.  I think this was an interesting story dipped in realism.  I loved it because it gave a most accurate portrayal of middle class blacks in America, not the usual white view of our parents always looking old and dowdy.  We have older black  men and women that are well dressed as well as appealing in their attire.  We also know about culture and manners.  That is the way we were raised.  Learn from this!!! White movies always portray us as whores or pimps or not having a clue on how to dress or act.  Wake up world, we are here and have just as much culture and finesse as any other race of people.  Three cheers and well done.  A sequel would be nice.",1152403200,4,864,4.233128834355829
2526244,5,B000EOTTUY,"Usually when I see movies that have any kind of ""race"" plot, I end up getting mad. I end up shouting at the screen, ""That ain't real!"" or ""Who wrote this? The Stereotype Preservation Society?""  During this movie, I didn't yell once, I only laughed and shook my head in empathy.

When you're in an black / white relationship (speaking from experience and from being the product of such a relationship) race issues come up. From hair: ""Oh my goodness, does this white guy know about weaves? Will he understand why I don't want to go swimming?"" to coming home and needing to vent about some racist ish that happened at the office that day and / or the ""black tax."" to...well, too many things to list in a short review. This movie addresses them all BUT also shows that if you're in a relationship with a person who cares and is willing to learn and listen, the problems can be addressed and hopefully, overcome.

I loved the dialogue, the realness of the conversations black people have when alone and that black women have when talking about the slim pickings for marriage and the recent Washington Post article that states that over 40% of black women will never get married.  The movie is just as much about the growth of the main character, Kenya, as it is a love story.

Most of us, like Kenya, have the ""ideal man"" in our head, but sometimes love comes to us in a crazy looking package. In the case of this movie, this package was a good-looking white guy who drives a truck and wants to bring his dog with him everywhere.

Yes, the movie is told mostly from Kenya's perspective, but another plus of this movie is that *every* perspective is respected.  Even though this is a comedy, you may find yourself learning something and perhaps, even changing your own viewpoint along the way.  Even though I identified with Kenya, I could feel Brian's frustration at wanting to get close to her, but not understanding some of her issues.

Without giving too much away, Something New has all the laughs of a comedy without skimming over the realness of matters of race and of the heart. The cliche is true: you'll laugh (it is a comedy, not a documentary on interracial love), you'll cry (okay, I did...maybe it's just me) but if you're sensitive about matters of race in Hollywood (like me) I promise you won't find yourself yelling at the screen in frustration.",1152316800,13,2358,4.568720379146919
2526245,5,B000EOTTUY,"I would hardly classify myself as a hopeless romantic, but I nevertheless really enjoyed this movie.  This is the type of movie I wish ""Guess Who"" had been when it came out a few years ago.  While ""Guess Who"" played the race card strictly for (forced) laughs, ""Something New"" delivers a message that touches upon, but ultimately goes beyond, race.  Interestingly, some of the personal attacks that appear in a few negative comments on Amazon, demonstrate why Something New's message of openness, living and loving ""outside of the box,"" is still so current and very much needed in our society.  Generalized (and inaccurate) statements regarding white men's supposed lack-of-interest in black women, and classifying Tony Award-nominated thespian Sanaa Lathan as a ""B-movie"" actress, demonstrate that, unfortunately, the pre-conceived notions and stereotypes that Something new addresses are still very much alive and well.  As a white woman, I am sure that I am not alone when I say that Hollywood is in desperate need of more movies like Something New.

Fortunately, like myself, the majority of professional and audience critics recognized this movie for the gem that it is.  Sanaa Lathan has such magnetism that you can't take your eyes off her on screen.  Not only is she obviously beautiful to look at, but she has an inherent screen presence rarely seen in actresses nowadays, of any race.  Simon Baker is ridiculously handsome in grungy jeans and tee-shirts, and, instead of playing Brian purely as eye-candy, turns the leading man into a multi-dimensional character with flaws just like the rest of us (check out the break-up scene in the grocery store).  And, as usual, Alfre Woodard effortlessly nails the role of Kenya's insufferable mother.  The rest of the cast is a hoot, especially Kenya's brother Nelson, and her girlfriends.

If you are the type of person who was shocked by the original ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" or ""Jungle Fever,"" then you might find Something New uncomfortable to watch, but that's all the more reason why you should.  For the rest of us (hopefully, the majority) who can appreciate a solid movie with quality acting, and beauty/talent in all colors, shapes, and sizes, Something New will definitely not disappoint.  Add this movie to your DVD collection.",1152057600,24,2295,5.085333333333334
2526246,3,B000EOTTUY,"But I have to give this movie 3 stars. I may be in the minority on this one and please understand that I am a huge fan of Sanaa Lathaan but this movie just didn't do it for me.

Alright there you have the hard working motivated African American woman who has a group of strong African American friends that encourage her to date. That is a great premise kind of on the line of ""The Brothers"" but lets keeps going.

Kenya is strong willed and has the typical black woman attitude even though this movie tried to counter attack this by placing her career accomplisments within the movie. However to everyones surprise she falls for a white man that is her complete opposite.

Great, but this day and age I think that this movie was a little late! Maybe it should have followed on the heels of Jungle Fever and maybe it would have been a better movie with more of an impact for me. Something New wasn't anything New at all!",1151971200,3,920,4.30635838150289

2526248,3,B000EOTTUY,"Something New stars Sanaa Lathan and some unknown make actor that's basically a re-write of Guess Who from last year. Only this time, it attempts to be a slightly more serious movie. While doing that, it still adds nothing that we haven't seen before.

It does the whole ""You can't date that white boy"" thing. Very predictable. You don't even have to see this film to know how it's pretty much going to play out.

Hollywood has struggled to come up with anything the last few years that does something more than go through the motions. This is another in a long line.

You can't blame the actors. It's hollywood that has the problem. With this films extremely poor boxoffice showing it shows you that in some ways people are getting tired of these type of films and people knew this would be a generic movie.

This situation has been done plenty of times including in a mediocre film like Summer Catch. They just try and throw the race thing into it and call it ""Something New"". Don't be a fool and fall for this.

PS:

To the reviewer below. Trick Daddy is an awful trashy looking dude that has to sample because he's uncreative himself. Once you've sampled, you've shown that you have no creative juices.

Anyway, I had seen ""Something New"" the first day of its release and I'm now happy to own it on disc. It's a good story because the whole production of this movie is great. The message clearly states to be yourself, love who you are, and you will eventually love that other person.

These days people are so caught up with their Looks, Sex, Material Things, etc, etc. But what really matters in life is on the ""inside"", who you really are--- And of course, the positive message of mixed-race relationships-- I read that these type of marriages double in number for the last 10 years. Which I guess, is a good thing, as being prejudiced is not. I was raise in Europe and now live in Texas, and I still see that people are sensitive about mixed relationships, and not too comfortable with that. But that is changing, in the direction, the movie showed us. I also love the Soundtrack.

Don't read the reviews from this chicks that probably spend hours on end watching the lifetime channel.

What's worse is the price... 21 bucks? Are they out of their minds? How in the world is this movie worth 21 bucks with it's mediocre cast, unoriginal plot, and being a totally predictable movie. Crazy I tell ya. Just crazy.

2526251,4,B000EOTTUY,"This movie was good. I found the dialog to be smart and provocative. When Brian meets Kenya, she has definitely met her match and you get the sense of tension and excitement when two dissimilar people have strong feelings for each other.

The Dialog reminded me of ""When Harry Met Sally"" in that it feels real and like neither character is holding back. My only slight annoyance with this film is that I felt that Kenya should have verbally stuck up for Brian more, although she does do some special things towards the end. A good movie for Girls' Night Out, because of the funny dialog between Kenya and her close female friends. The film is easy for anyone to relate to who has been in love.

Kenya struggles to make in a white dominated world whilst looking for her ideal black man take a different and unexpected turn when she gets set up by a work colleague in going on a blind date with a guy who turns out to be white landscape architect Brian.

Having reluctantly let him come and work on the garden of her new house Kenya sets up the rule that nothing is going to happen between them but of course we know different and after going hiking with Brian (one of her don'ts things get hot and steamy between them.

The movie looks at the issue of trying something new yes it cliched and we have heard this all before but I found this film not only sweet and entertaining but it introduced to me to Simon Baker who is absolutely adorable and should in my opinion had his shirt on a lot less.

The supporting cast was fantastic including Alfre Woodward, and Donald Faison. The only weak point for me is that the dvd didn't have any deleted scenes which is something I do look forward to.

2526255,4,B000EOTTUY,"When the movie Something New was being advertised on the Black radio station that I listen to earlier this year, it was being touted as ""a movie by Black women for Black women about what Black women want."" Because the movie is about a love affair between a Black woman and a White man, we are to believe that what Black women want are White men. As the DVD came to the stores, they changed the marketing a bit. It's now a romantic comedy about a Black woman trying to find Mr. Right, and race isn't even mentioned. After watching the movie, the latter marketing strategy was more accurate. This movie isn't as much about race as we are led to believe although some people aren't going to get past the race issue and pay attention to the deeper issues.

Sanaa Lathan plays Kenya McQueen, a smart, beautiful, well-off, and a successful professional. All of the Black people in this movie are well-off and firmly entrenched in the upper-class. Although it was probably not Something New's intention, this movie is more about the division of class than race.

Kenya and her girlfriends are looking for their ideal black man: well-spoken, well-educated, and be close to the same professional caliber. They want a man who is their class equal. Although it is  difficult, Kenya keeps hope alive for her IBM.

Enter landscaper, Brian, played by Simon Baker. He's a small-business owner who makes a decent living. Brian and Kenya have a strong chemistry, but Kenya is very resistant to their relationship even before it begins. On the outside, she plays the race card saying she would prefer Black men. As the movie moves along and we get a deeper look into her upper-class upbringing, we realize that race is only the second problem. Brian is not upper class in the slightest. As the romance goes through its ups and downs, class and race battle it out for the cause.

Something New is a refreshing twist on an old story, and a date movie that can cross racial barriers. Simon Baker and Sanaa Lathan heat up the screen with their furtive glances brimming with lust. When they finally come together, you'll exhale as though you were in the romantic clinch. Sanaa Lathan proves she is a great young actress as she conveys a thousand feelings with just a mere expression. I don't know where Hollywood has been hiding Simon Baker, but they need to get him into more movies pronto.",1149897600,5,2368,4.655502392344498

But as I have learned sometimes you have to get outside of your comfort zone to discover and to be who you really are inside whatever skin color you happen to find yourself packaged in.  So needless to say I liked the movie but am disappointed in the DVD, the bonus features were very weak.  I would have like to have seen some of the deleted scenes.

2526258,3,B000EOTTUY,"This is an enjoyable, well cast, and workmanlike romantic comedy -- neatly structured and satisfying to watch. All the plots and subplots come together to make the point that, while inter-racial relationships are not easy and racism pervades all quarters of American life, love wins out over racial barriers. In a way, that's the most fundamental of all American dreams -- so of course the viewer is happy to see everything work out for this adorable couple (Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker are a very cute pair). The other American dream (of professional success) also appears here and is likewise satisfactorily resolved. A real feel-good film -- nothing bad about that!

Sometimes, however, I thought the movie set up its conflicts and made its arguments too easily. It was too obviously a film that set out to prove something: in this case that true love conquers all. I enjoy that message myself, but I didn't always feel that the film was making it emotionally believable or complicated enough. For example, Kenya's African American suitor (Mark played by the devilishly handsome Blair Underwood) appears in this film simply as a contrast to Brian. He is the ""IBM"" (Ideal Black Man), a moniker used in the film that somewhat betrays the stereotype he fulfills, but neither he -- nor the progress of his relationship with Kenya (which I shall refrain from revealing so as not to be a spoiler) has much depth. That subplot seems to exist simply to advance the main plot and make the film's larger point.  (And Underwood better watch out for being typecast -- He played this same part, too-good-to-be-true-but-I-don't-really-love-him, in ""Sex and the City"" opposite Miranda.)

2526262,5,B000EOTTUY,"As someone who usually finds herself at the movies when a romantic comedy hits the theaters, I have to say that QUALITY romantic comedies are few and far between.  ""Something New"" is one of these rare romantic comedies that finally gets it right!  Most romantic comedies--while a fairly harmless way to spend $10 on a Friday night--rarely make me want to go out and buy the DVD.  On the other hand, I couldn't wait for ""Something New"" to be released on video, and I picked up my copy the first day of its release.

""Something New"" gives us a rare glimpse into the actual process of two people falling in love.  Most so-called romances jump straight to the sex, and it's all downhill from there.  It was really gratifying to actually witness Kenya and Brian's feelings and relationship evolve on screen.  The commentary on interracial dating and its complications (even in this modern day and age) was ""just right"": realistic, but subtle.  There was no need to beat the viewer over the head with the race issue, with such stellar actors to convey the message.  As an African-American woman, I enjoyed the fresh perspective on a subject that is too often either delivered in an overly ""preachy"" way, or ignored entirely in film.

All-in-all, ""Something New"" is an uplifting movie, with a universal message:  Sometimes a person that looks perfect ""on paper"" is not THE ONE, and love can strike where you least expect it.  Whether happily committed or still-looking for Mr./Ms. Right, that's a message we can all relate to.",1148947200,5,1519,4.777777777777778

2526264,4,B000EOTTUY,"I was fully prepared to dislike this 2006 film since on the surface, it seems like yet another variation on the overused rom-com formula of the high-powered woman finding true love against her initial judgment. The fact that it employs the race card had me concerned that another version of last year's soft-centered ""Guess Who"" was in store. However, this type of movie depends so much more on execution than story framework, and director Sanaa Hamri and writer Kriss Turner, both first-timers in feature films, have done a surprisingly effective job in making the premise feel fresh and involving in spite of its predictable elements.

The story focuses on Kenya McQueen, a type-A and anal-retentive corporate accountant on the verge of making partner at her firm. Her depressingly beige single life is given a jolt by Brian, a hunky gardener first on a blind date at Starbucks and then as her landscape architect. The fact that she is black and he is white makes her resistant to his romantic impulses until he taps into her soul. Of course, there is passive disapproval all around, but the biggest barrier is how the couple responds to their own inherent racism. This is where the movie exceeds expectations, especially in a bitterly honest conversation at a supermarket, as the tension goes palpably beyond racism into differences in socioeconomic status and life priorities. Enter Mark, the ideal black man, handsome, ambitious and the perfect match for Kenya. If you cannot figure out the rest of the plot, then clearly you do not go to the movies much.

So much of the success of the film depends on the right casting of the leads. Luckily, this is not a problem here. Sanaa Lathan does a fine job showing all the emotional contours of Kenya, and with a winking nod to ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"", Simon Baker is appropriately magnetic as Brian. Similar to the role he played as Miranda's failed suitor on ""Sex in the City"", Blair Underwood plays his stock character as Mark with somewhat predictable aplomb. Speaking of which, Kenya is surrounded by a trio of ""Sex""-like girlfriends played with relish by Wendy Raquel Robinson (especially sharp as Cheryl), Golden Brooks and Taraji P Henson (last seen in a 180-degree turn as the cowering pregnant hooker Shug in last year's ""Hustle and Flow""). I just wish there were more scenes with the four of them bantering. The usually wondrous Alfre Woodward is wasted playing Kenya's exclusionary mother, but she does what she can with the stereotypical role, as does Donald Faison from ""Scrubs"" as Kenya's aspiring playboy brother Nelson.

It actually helps that Hamri was a music video director before this movie. She provides a nice visual style, in particular, an intriguing use of jump cuts and elliptical edits that make the story move along at a nice clip and feel less predictable than it is. Turner's screenplay is especially observant and trenchant in the small moments at Kenya's workplace and her housewarming party. It's refreshing to see such an unbiased portrayal of upscale black professionals without some heavy social message attached.  The DVD has few extras - no commentary track, a perfunctory ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather silly five minute short, ""Do's and Don't's of Dating"", in which cast members offer their advice.",1148774400,4,3304,4.99092558983666
2526265,5,B000EOTTUY,"Loved the movie for most of the reasons already stated. That being said, here's ""something new"" not yet discussed that I observed. I noticed that Brian always had on blue (or something that matched blue).  Obviously that was on purpose and intentional to bring out his blue eyes.  It worked, even driving the truck over to Kenya's to check out her back yard for the first time he had on red (shirt), white (guy) & blue (eyes).  It matched and he always looked good, even with his dirty job.  Too good sometimes because how can you work in dirt all the time Mr. Landscape Architect and have fingernails that clean?  Just an observation, and I get that they had to be clean for the movie to work, otherwise we would be like ""Eeewwwww, look at his dirty fingernails"", instead of ""What a cutie"".",1148774400,,791,4.503496503496503
2526266,4,B000EOTTUY,"I saw this film in the theater (literally going out of town to catch a sneak preview, held up in horrible rush hour traffic, and barely making it there) I was so intrigued by the premise of the movie. I do love romances, whether comedy or drama, but it is so hard to find decent ones lately, it seems. And to find that rarest of plotlines---exploring interracial love in an open-minded, open-hearted way, was just too good to resist.

Well, the movie delivered and more.

It helps, of course, that the leads are absolutely gorgeous. Would we want to look at average people for a couple of hours? But that aside, the plot is mind expanding, exploring interracial love in an honest way, with a few twists and turns on the usual format. If you want to know more on that, check out some of the other reviews. Or better still, leave some mystery to discover when you actually buy this DVD and watch it.

The main theme of the movie is to ""be willing to be open to true love in whatever outer package it comes in, and follow your heart"".

We singletons can get so stuck in our perfect ""other"" list, that we may miss the ""perfect one for us"" by eliminating the one who doesn't quite fit.

Running concurrently, there is a major theme of discovering who you really are and what you really want in life. Also, being willing to shake up the status quo, and potentially disappoint loved ones to find your own way. As a maverick myself in life, I was routing for the Sanaa character to make the hard choices for her personal growth. Just as the Simon character discovered corporate life wasn't for him, and made the subsequent changes.

While Blair Underwood is a hotie, and I would be routing for him normally---not in this movie. It is Simon Baker all the way. He is the best one for Sanaa.

You can debate all you want about the ""realities"" of the plotline. But this is a romantic comedy, guys! It isn't meant to be 100% politically and culturally correct! Just call it a slice of life that could actually happen somewhere to two people, who found each other, and fell in love.",1148688000,5,2068,4.426315789473684
2526267,4,B000EOTTUY,"This lovely film tackles a lot issues, but at its heart Something New is a sweet romance between a young, successful woman who happens to be black and a landscape architect who happens to be white.  The chemistry between Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker is great.  You can tell that these two are madly in love, but you can also feel how torn Sanaa Lathan's Kenya is between what her heart tells her and what those around her expect.  While a romance, this film also brings up interesting issues like what it means to still be black in American society, whether or not one should marry out of his or her race, and expectations of those around us.  And I have to say it handles all of this well without selling out, or being to preachy.  Granted, the film has a happy ending, but that happy ending comes after a lot of realistic soul searching and painful choices.  I also have to mention the great supporting cast that includes Blair Underwood, Alfre Woodard (fantastic as Kenya's overbearing, but loving mother), and Donald Faison.

2526268,5,B000EOTTUY,"The supermarket scene saved the movie from falling onto my list of fairy tale favorites, up there with Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White, Shrek and them.  The movie was wonderful, but it oh so needed that supermarket scene, which I'll come back to.  I loved the honesty of this movie.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Kenya reacted, said and did exactly what I feel I would have done in the same situations.  I could so relate.

However, not knowing how white guys do it, I wouldn't know if Brian was realistic in how he reacted to stuff like being called a night light and probation officer which was too funny or having his hand slapped, instead of shaken by the brother who looked down on him as the help.  I think the movie handled Brian's reactions to all the beatdowns superbly, even if not realistically because it felt good to me watching Simon Baker with his fine self play Brian.

But somewhere in the back of my mind, I was waiting for him to go off, because come on, no man I know of, white, red, brown, yellow and especially black would have had the patience and tolerance Brian had for not only Kenya, but her family and friends. I mean, how could he know if she was worth taking all of that abuse?  Maybe he learned that patience from waiting for flowers to bloom/gardens to grow.  But it was not very realistic for me, but enjoyable to watch.

So when Brian finally, finally expressed some frustration in the supermarket, I was like, yeah, now we got us a real movie here, even if the white guy doesn't have a freakin' clue and sounded somewhat like he had been patronizing her all along by letting her talk about ""the plantation"".  Maybe, maybe not.

And yes, the chemistry between Sanaa and Simon was just as strong as the chemistry between Sanaa and Denzel (Out of Time), Sanaa and Omar (Love and Basketball) or Sanaa and Taye (The Best Man and Brown Sugar).  It may have been hotter and that gives me ""something new"" to think about.",1148688000,5,1957,4.46067415730337

2526270,4,B000EOTTUY,"The incredible Sanaa Lathan playes Kenya McQueen who looks beautiful in both business smarts and colorful casuals.  This is a story of a black woman from a very good upbringing who is just too much of an overachiever to enjoy herself.  When the rakishly sexy blonde gardner Brian (played by Aussie actor Simon Baker), agrees to do her landscaping despite her rejecting him on a previous blind date, things begin to change in interesting ways for Kenya.

The movie addresses the obvious black-white issues without becoming too political, and in doing so highlights typical relationship behavior like: arguments, reluctance to show the boyfriend to parents, confused feelings when meeting the ideal man.  Admittedly, the movie does not contain the heavy substance of say a torrid love affair, but this is meant to be a romantic comedy with some insightful views to think about.

Kenya learns over time that she should take the advice of her girlfriends and ""Let Go, Let Flow"" to really enjoy herself and love the man who truly makes her feel alive.

Simon Baker steals the show in this one, and the chemistry gels very well with Sanaa.  Check out the brother and each new girlfriend he shows up to an event with.  Enjoyable and endearing movie.",1148256000,5,1242,4.880952380952381
2526271,4,B000EOTTUY,"""Something New"" is a romantic comedy with a social agenda. Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) is a workaholic investment banker with no time or patience for men. She yearns for companionship but has impossibly high -and very specific- standards. Urged by her friends to loosen up and ""let go"" of her concept of the ideal man, she agrees to a blind date arranged by a co-worker. If only the date were colorblind too. Kenya is set up with Brian Kelley (Simon Baker), a handsome, easy-going landscape architect who abandoned his corporate career to go into business doing what he loves. But Brian is white. Kenya is black. And white men are at the top of the list of things Kenya doesn't do. But she does need a landscaper for her new backyard. So she hires Brian, and their mutual attraction blossoms -to the variable horror and curiosity of Kenya's friends and family.

The moral of the story is that social conventions don't always know best in matters of the heart: You might find the companion you seek if you are open to other possibilities. Kenya and Brian's story is predictable, but Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker are attractive and interesting to watch. The greater social insight of the film may be in Kenya's coterie of friends, all upper-middle class professional black women who fret over the dearth of suitable black men available to them. Their predicament and their views of men and race are interesting from the perspective of an outsider. White members of the audience will doubt Brian's willingness to tolerate the enormous chip Kenya carries on her shoulder. And he is more tolerant and self-sacrificing in the face of Kenya's self-absorption than is believable. But romantic comedies require some suspension of disbelief, and ""Something New"" is entertaining.

The DVD (Universal 2006): In ""The Do's and Don'ts of Dating"" (5 min), 8 members of the cast give their do's and don'ts of dating and relationships. ""The Making of Something New"" (11 min) features interviews with director Sanaa Hamri, writer Kriss Turner, producer Stephanie Allain, and the cast in which they talk about making the film and discuss the film's themes. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.",1147996800,48,2211,4.940860215053763
2526272,4,B000EOTTUY,"I should have gone to an actual theatre to see ""Something

New.""  I rented it instead.  When I saw the promos for it,

I thought it wouldn't interest me.  I've always like movies

that explored the theme of interracial romance and I could

easily relate to the characters in this movie.  I know this

isn't an intelligent review. I just wanted to express that I

saw it and it's really a good movie for us Romantics at heart!",1147910400,8,425,4.333333333333333
2526273,4,B000EOTTUY,"SOMETHING NEW is one of those films that many will pass by thinking it is just another Chick Flick with a twist.  Well, this little movie may be a romantic comedy but it is well written (Kriss Turner), well directed (Sanaa Hamri), and very well acted and has some down to earth important observations about interpersonal relationships...and, oh yes, it deal with interracial issues, beautifully!

Kenya (Sanaa Lathan - Best Man, Blade, The Wood, etc) is a beautiful Type A personality, an overachiever who is up for Partner in her Accounting Firm: she has no time to search for IMB (Important Black Man) as her list of qualifications is far too extensive.  Her fellow professional girlfriends (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Golden Brooks and Taraji P. Henson - all superb!) encourage her to date to 'go with the flow' and a fellow business associate sets her up with a blind date - the very handsome, hunky, landscape architect Brian Kelly (Simon Baker - superb actor from Tasmania, Australia has starred in LA Confidential, Book of Love, The Ring Two, The Affair of the Necklace etc) - and despite the fact that Kenya refuses to consider dating any man who is not black, she does accept Brian's card and in no time hires him to landscape her new home.

The usual dating events occur: Simon is an educated, laid-back, tender, thoughtful, adventuresome male who happens to fall in love with the closely guarded Kenya; when introduced at parties Simon falls victim to prejudice form black men AND form Kenya's parents; Kenya gradually succumbs to Brian's charms and despite all misgivings they begin an affair.  But peer pressures, work demands, and Kenya's self doubt jumble matters and she decides she must search for a black man.  One 'just happens' to appear as Mark (Blair Underwood) and for a moment Kenya believes she has found her ideal - until her heart speaks up and she for the first time is honest with her emotions and follows her true heart's desire.

The  apparent disparity between Kenya and Brian is handled in a sensitive and realistic way and Lathan and Baker have a sizzling screen chemistry.  The supporting roles are in excellent hands: in addition to those mentioned above there are fine roles by Alfre Woodward, Earl Billings, Donald Faison, Mike Epps etc.  This is a fine little film that approaches the touchy subject of black professional women who are unmarried ('42.4 Percent' was the working title) and for once shows an interracial film that is more a sound love story than a sermon.  It is light, airy, important, and thoroughly entertaining!  (This coming from a viewer who doesn't particularly care for Chick Flicks....!).  Grady Harp, May 06",1147910400,13,2667,4.886917960088692
2526274,3,B000EOTTUY,"The considerable acting skills of Sanaa Lathan, Blair Underwood, and Simon Baker saved this movie from being a total and complete failure. The end result was that I enjoyed the movie. Not enough to buy it, but certainly enough to rent the DVD.

Before I saw it, I assumed [as everyone should know by now] that the white guy would end up with the girl ... and I was not mistaken. The writer, by the way, is a sister, Kriss Turner. But, even so, I figured she would concede that if she wanted her script to sell, she had better play up to the White Male ego.

Now, since so many of you reading this are now thinking ""another black guy playing the race card"" I challenge you to drop back two paces, take a deep breath, and consider all of Sanaa Lathan's work.

I am an unabashed Sanaa Lathan fan. I make a point of checking out any thing I find out she is in. So, I have seen, and own in my private DVD collection,  ""Brothers"", ""Love and Basketball"", ""Disappearing Acts"", ""Best Man"", and ""Brown Sugar"". So, I think back over all of her movies and I find that all of her male romantic interests in all these movies were black and had some serious character flaws [remember Wesley Snipes' character in ""Disappearing Acts""]. The one exception to the rule, up until now, was ""Brothers"" and only because the movie ended before anything serious could develop between Sanaa's and Omar Epps' characters.

So, now, we have a change up. In this her latest movie aptly named ""Something New"", her love interest is now white and is now as near to perfect as a writer can make a character without boring the audience to tears. Kudos to Simon Baker for figuring out how to take a boring weak white male lead character and mold him into this incredibly strong yet sensitive person who can be beat up throughout the entire movie by any and all of the other black characters and still come out at the end not looking like a big wussy.

In ""Something New"", in the scene where Sanaa dumps Blair Underwood, she admits, tearfully, that Blair's character is perfect. After all, he is wealthy, good-looking, upwardly mobile,  and, well, he is Blair Underwood. Still, she just can't help herself. She just has to dump the brother and run back into the arms of the White Guy. The same guy who proved, in a couple of earlier scenes, that not only does he not get the pain a black professional goes through dealing with White Supremacy, he thinks it is all just an illusion in our heads!

8112361,5,B000EOTTUY,"This has always been one of my favorite movies.  It's an interesting take on interracial relationships in the 1980s, especially since it's told primarily from the perspective of an African-American woman.  Sanaa Lathan is stunning and her performance is aces throughout the film.  She is matched by Simon Baker and the not entirely smooth romance between the two is well played. The fact that Kendra comes from a very well to do Black family and has to deal with their expectations of her creates a situation in which most of the pressure and inner conflicts are hers really makes the story go. I've been waiting for years for Something New to come out on Blu-ray and it's finally here.",1524528000,,686,4.7478991596638656
