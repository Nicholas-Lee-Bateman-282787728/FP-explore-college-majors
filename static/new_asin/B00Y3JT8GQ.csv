I get low budget and I get indie movies and love them but I do expect them to make some kind of sense. I felt the story was convoluted and at times too slow to be even pointless. The cover has something about a sociopath? I didn't see any! I am really not certain even after listening to Brian explain things that I saw it and I'm not a dummy. Brain and Adam are friends from college and then later move in together with their girlfriends and the cheat and then people start leaving this little house and then and then and then.......the ending was in some dark thing which I have questions about too? it was not good on any level and I wasted my money and my time.",1485475200,,796,4.209150326797386

8717491,5,B00Y3JT8GQ,"Don't let the poster fool you into thinking its just some cheap thriller movie. This is actually a movie with heart, intelligence, and style. It obviously takes influence from lots of famous directors from film history but at the same time feels very fresh and new. It won't be to everyone's liking. Not a mainstream type movie. Feels like an art house movie with really relatable characters.",1439510400,,392,4.865671641791045
8717492,5,B00Y3JT8GQ,"I went to Stanford and knew about Follmer and his company in Berkeley when they were fledgling. Proud to see a young start up film prodution company starting to crank out good-quality stuff.

This film is much more slower and daring than Follmer's earlier film ""Bullish."" It's about the relationship between two friends as they navigate the imbalances of artistic pressure and commercial success. The scenes are long and have great cinematogrpahic quality. Might be a little slow for some but if you're a fan of Dardenne brothers or Paul Thomas Anderson, you'll appreciate it. I'd recommend buying it and helping this young company get some love.",1439510400,,646,5.037383177570093
