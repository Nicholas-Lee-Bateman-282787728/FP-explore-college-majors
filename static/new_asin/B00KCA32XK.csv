6414609,5,B00KCA32XK,"This pair of crime investigators get results but during and after cases fall into HS boy-crazy mode concerning their personal dating life. Or momentary lack of. Just part of their character. DI Kate Ashurst called `Ash' (Caroline Catz -`Doc Martin') is a good Middleford CID cop and an easy date. DS Emma Scribbins called `Scrib' (Lisa Faulkner -`MI-5') uses her head to solve crime but cares little about marital status for her beaus. Viewers get to see both sides of these ladies, but mostly the crime solving side.

As regular cast: DCI Sullivan (Jeremy Sheffield) the boss handsome enough for the 2 cops to ogle; Gallimore (Glen Davies); and a Pathologist (Stuart Nurse).

SDH SUBTITLES for both complete seasons, 12 episodes (in order of discs; only season 2 has titles). Just a few of the guest stars are noted.
Season 1
1---Ash & Scrib investigate a stabbed, divorced, business woman, also a member of a club `Applejacks', from where the rich singles pile up as suspects. Danny Webb plays the victim's ex.
2---A co-owner found found floating dead in Middleford club's pool with hands handcuffed has to be murder. His partner hosted a stag party for him. The fiancee, daughter of the mayor (Philip Jackson -`Poirot') may be having an affair the partner (Daniel Casey -`Midsomer Murders').
3---A torched Mercedes contains body remains. The post neighborhood has plenty of affairs equal to motive. Including the victim's wife Hanna (Rebecca Lacey -`Monarch of the Glen'); a brother (Lee Williams -`Forsyte Saga'); and neighbor (Philip Bretherton -`As Time Goes By').
4---A volunteer to `Jungle Alert' African charity is a stabbing murder case for the lady cops. The search for a motive reveals swapping couples that complicate matters.
5---Helen McKee is a sidewalk hit-&-run victim, likely murder. The parent list of Middleford Comprehensive School provides suspects. Headmaster played by James Fleet (`Outlander' `Little Dorrit' `Sense & Sensibility'). Also see Russell Boulter from `Darling Buds of May'.
6---Man killed in his workshop by claw hammer. Neighbors and wife (Phyllis Logan -`Downton Abbey') are suspect.
Season 2
7---Witches -A teen stabbed in cemetery. Is it a product of schoolgirl witchcraft? Her diary reveals more. Dermot Crowley (`Bleak House') is vicar. Also see Tom Goodman-Hill (`Mr Selfridge') and Clare Higgins.
8---Estate Agents -Colleagues and clients hate womanizing estate agent Jakes, but enough for murder?
9---The Wedding -Henry Goodman (`Notting Hill') plays Howard Goodman. A drinker dad of the bride is victim of a wedding reception murder. Affairs are rampant among the 2 wedding families.
10---Salsa -It wasn't a salsa dance that got Sandra off her balcony to a fallen death. Suspects: Husband? Instructor? Dancer she replaced? Ash salsas. Guest stars: Lynsey Baxter (`Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'); Stella Gonet (`House of Eliott').
11---Dogs -Doggie Day Care owner murdered while walking dogs. Which dog owner can be trusted; which murdered? The dog whisperer? A lover? See William Armstrong (`Silent Witness').
12---Golden Oldies -JJ, (Frank Barrie -`Calendar Girls') a 1950's vocalist drowns in his tub--with help. His wife lived with him in the seniors' home, but was hanky-planking in the next-door apartment. Many older top guest stars including Michael Jayston and Michele Dotrice (`Bramwell' `Middlemarch' `Les Mis').",1407283200,29,3367,5.362948960302457
6414610,4,B00KCA32XK,"We love watching British detective series (with the occasional detours into Australian or Canadian detective series).  Murder in Suburbia is a good one.

We loved Caroline Catz in Doc Martin and immediately knew we had to check out this series.  Catz's character Ash in this series is a lot more uptight than Louisa from Doc Martin.  Lisa Faulkner's Scribbs is the more free-spirited of the two.  They banter about love, sex and relationships (Ash is the one with The Rules), but the working and personal relationship between the two of them is the focus of this story.

The murders have a decidedly suburban flavor - prep schools, weddings, estate agents, charities.  No breathtaking locations here.  Sometimes it seems like murder is an easy solution for the privileged perp - he was bugging me so I just decided to get rid of him.  It's all kind of breezy and formulaic - the ""frothy"" blurb on the box is appropriate.  They are not reinventing the wheel here but it is a worthy addition to the female detective canon, and nice to see a pair of British female detectives do their stuff.",1407110400,92,1088,4.708994708994709

6414623,4,B00KCA32XK,This was quite enjoyable but other than the 2 detectives being women (How Hollywood sexist is that!!!) there really isn't anything original here. The lead actresses carry the show and they do a good job doing that.,1508025600,,214,4.8108108108108105

6414625,5,B00KCA32XK,"This entertaining 2004 British mystery series takes place in the fictional English town of Middleford. Caroline Catz plays Inspector Kate Ashurst and Lisa Faulkner plays Sergeant Emma Scribbins, two well-dressed, wise-cracking, female detectives who must face a variety of grisly murders in the well-manicured suburban homes of Middleford, but who also are facing an unmarried middle age squarely in the mirror. The crimes they solve are clever and bizarre enough to make them interesting, and the suspects are just trendy and snobby enough that you just know they must be Mac users. Kate's romantic subplot centers on her hapless pursuit of their handsome supervisor, Chief Inspector Sullivan, played by Jeremy Sheffield. Emma's love life is a bit more varied with any number of odd sorts, all having dubious qualities. My wife and I have viewed this series many times and find something new and enjoyable with each viewing. Highly recommended!",1506643200,,945,5.306666666666667
6414626,5,B00KCA32XK,Very well done murder mysteries.  Involving dialogues.  Enticing beauties that can get the job done with style..,1503792000,,112,5.529411764705882

6414629,5,B00KCA32XK,"A series so light the actual DVD may just float in mid-air near your TV.
Excellent comfort food with two excellent leads providing cheery nonsense in calming bland settings.
Pity it stopped after only two series.",1501718400,,212,4.916666666666667
6414630,5,B00KCA32XK,This is a delightful mystery series.  The lighthearted banter between the two lead characters does not overwhelm the excellent mystery they are assigned to solve.  Like Midsomer Mysteries the stories often build on domestic conflicts (murder).  Fresh and fun!,1501459200,,259,5.589743589743589

6414638,2,B00KCA32XK,"The main characters are likable and that makes these series watchable. However (** spoiler alter **) every chapter ends the same way the killer confesses and divulges all the little details that pull the crime together. That said most of the plots and characters are laughable. I also get the impression that the writers were a tight group who had some very bias opinions about women. Not your typical bias but bias none the less.

Watch this if you just need to watch something BBC, you'll get through and might even like some parts. As a crime series - a joke.",1499299200,,562,4.564356435643564

6414645,5,B00KCA32XK,"It features Caroline Catz in a leading role.  Actually, that should be more than enough, but ""Murder in Suburbia"" also mixes the uniquely British criminal investigation methodology with the uniquely British sense of humor.

6414659,3,B00KCA32XK,"I loved the Season 1, hated Season 2. The sub-plot line that developed more in Season 2  about one of the detectives and the boss reduced what could have been a unique detective series for intelligent women to tripe. And the boss wasn't worth her time, he always was putting them down making them feel as ""gir""l outsiders, not one of his team like he would two guys. The two detectives are first rate actors, the writer was a second rate sexist guy. And in the second series, the men in the department started harassing them.
What a shame an intelligent woman writer didn't take over but she didn't. So the series had no where to go but off the air.",1478476800,,649,4.363636363636363

6414702,3,B00KCA32XK,"I had high hopes for this series as I really liked the actress who plays Ash (from Doc Martin series), and in general I love British mystery series. However, this show suffered from poor, actually idiotic, writing. The lady detectives come across as overly chatty not witty and as having a crush on their boss who apparently hasn't a clue about police work either. Nobody could take any of them seriously as detectives as they behave like high school students playing cops and robbers, not intelligent insightful women investigating murders. The stories plod along each episode with Ash always having the light bulb moment whereby she solves the murder in the last few minutes. It's not the actresses or actors fault that the dialogue is so inane. Nice try everyone, but it simply does not work as a fun mystery series.",1440806400,4,819,4.815602836879433

We bought Murder in Suburbia from Borders as separate seasons (each cost us more than Amazon's price for the complete set!), and they are probably the most-recommended and frequently-loaned-out set of light murder programs we have. They are really great fun, with possibly the most charmingly neurotic leads in British TV.  We were heartbroken that the series was discontinued so soon, but that's Brit TV for you.  If you like Caroline Catz in Doc Martin, you'll love her here, and Lisa Faulkner is equally fabulous.  I'd like to see more of her work, as she is incredibly versatile.

6414746,3,B00KCA32XK,"Different from most of the other British mystery series. The focus of Murder in Suburbia is on the relationship between the two women detectives and supporting each other in their personal lives, with a heavy dose of comedic lines and situations. The mystery is solved mostly by the detectives talking about various hypotheses, rather than the objective collection of evidence and analysis. The three main characters are engaging. The first episode was something of a shambles - Ash's way of interviewing corroborating witnesses is to tell them what someone else has stated and ask, Is that right?, rather than elicit an individual's account and spot the discrepancies to other witness statements. I don't know whether this was deliberately to guarantee the main actresses more lines and screen time, or to keep the mystery story line moving, or if the writer was just new to the genre. Reminds me of an old Cagney & Lacy episode when they have to review an old case and realize they were hopelessly naive and incompetent in their interview technique the first time around. I like that Ash and Scripps' boss gets more involved in the investigations as the series progresses. The detectives' fantasies about him are funny - and as they come up with positive explanations for what may seem like dubious behavior on his part - they are inevitably right, which is unusual in today's television and movie trends, e.g. SPOILER ALERT, Why is he wearing the same shirt he wore yesterday? Maybe his washing machine is broken. Yeah, no, he was probably catting around. And then at the end of the episode, Ash asks him about the package he's carrying - and it's brand new shirts because his washing machine is broken. Not sure that it's worth paying $30. You might want to wait until its on youtube or part of Amazon Prime Instant videos.",1424995200,,1827,4.840255591054313

Lots of good natured banter between the lady crime investigators especially regarding trying to find a man they can settle down with. The story line is pretty much the typical murder investigation situation. The great part is the good interaction between the 2 main characters.

That is probably largely because more of the shots are first-person view rather than from a stand-off camera.

6414780,5,B00KCA32XK,"MURDER IN SUBURBIA, (2004-2005) is a value-priced British television series. A complete collection of the two series of the British mystery/police procedural, it  was made by Granada TV, and is distributed by ITV Studios Global Entertainment. The crime drama  was seen on BBCAmerica in the United States.  It  stands out from the crowd of British crime dramas, as it is more lighthearted than most and features two women detectives. Caroline Catz, before she became an international star as Louisa in DOC MARTIN and Lisa Faulkner (MI-5) sparkle as bickering, bantering crime-solvers Kate Ashurst, (Ash), and Emma Scribbins, (Scribbs). Ash, graduate of a posh girls school, has an analytical mind and uses her head; Scribbs, of working class background, her instincts to catch killers in the seemingly perfect upmarket suburbs of the fictional town of Middleford.  All the while  facing political corruption, secretive millionaires, muy enthusiastic salsa dancers, and sleazy real estate agents. Jeremy Sheffield (The Wedding Date) is their handsome, bemused boss, DCI Sullivan.  The box set contains 12 episodes that run approximately 579 minutes on 4 DVDs.  Its for mature audiences only, as it has some nudity, coarse language, and sexual situations.  It also has a photo gallery, and, thank goodness, RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles, as Id hate to have missed any of its witty banter.  I received this as a review copy.

I enjoyed this series when it was shown on BBCAmerica.  Lighthearted it may be, but its sharp and entertaining, and got a bit of an edge.  Ironic humor and chutzpah.  And the female duo solve their cases, they don't cry, and they don't need to go to their male colleagues for help when the going gets tough.  Of course, CAGNEY AND LACEY pioneered the femme cop duo back in 1981, and since then the boundaries of female-headed entertainments have certainly been pushed back by SEX AND THE CITY.  More recently, perhaps building on this show, weve had RIZZOLI AND ISLES, and THE HEAT, with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy.  And now weve got the muy popular SCOTT AND BAILEY, another British TV two female cops series, pushing the boundaries way further yet.  Mind you, Caroline Catz, before DOC MARTIN, proves that shes the real deal, a beautiful woman who can act and has razor sharp comedic chops.  She and Faulkner are ably supported by many faces that will be familiar to those who watch a lot of British TV.  Among them, Philip Jackson, Inspector Japp in POIROT.  Philip Bretherton, Alistair Deacon in AS TIME GOES BY.  Edward Woodward, THE EQUALIZER.  Phyllis Logan, Mrs. Hughes in DOWNTON ABBEY.  The episodes, per Acorn, are:

Disc 1
Episode 1
The murder of a well-to-do businesswoman seems to be tied to Applejacks, a singles club.

Episode 2
A housewife who raises money for a charity benefiting African animals turns up dead; and the investigation leads to a group of patrons who excel at monkeying around.
.

Episode 3
Just your typical stag party - booze, carousing, strippers and murder.

Disc 2
Episode 4
A torched Mercedes and the burnt body of its owner lead the investigators to ritzy Hollingford Avenue, and they soon discover where there's smoke, there's fire.

Episode 5
How hard is it to get your child into prestigious Middleford Comprehensive? You might say it's murder.

Episode 6
Bernard Lloyd loved home improvement projects to death, literally - after his latest project proved to be too noisy for his sedate neighborhood, Bernard turns up murdered with his own hammer.

Disc 1
Episode 1
After teenager Holly Andrews dies of a single stab wound in a church graveyard one night, Ash and Scribbs delve into schoolgirl witchcraft at exclusive St Johns Academy. A coded diary reveals that more than one suspect was doing the jolly with Holly. But who was casting black spells on whom?

Episode 2
Estate agent Phil Jakes doesnt seem to care that most of his clients and even his colleagues hate him. But then someone closes Phils sale for good by applying a paperweight to the back of his head. His murder involves Ash and Scribbs in the seamy, cynical world of suburban real estate.

Episode 3
""Marriage is where we admit that our parents were right,"" Ash advises Scribbs. ""Dont ever forget that."" At this wedding, though, the father of the bride winds up dead wrong. Peeking behind the bridal veil and bouquets, Ash and Scribbs find that nothing is exactly what it seems.

Disc 2
Episode 4
Who saved the last dance for Sandra? The lovely young salsa enthusiast took a tumble off a high balcony, and her death definitely looks like murder. The investigation leads the detective duo to Middlefords steamiest salsa club, where the passions run as hot as the rhythms  and even Ash catches the fever.

Episode 5
The brutal murder of Christine Archer, proprietress of a local dog day care center, introduces Ash and Scribbs to some temperamental canines and their eccentric, equally temperamental owners. But, as Ash and Scribbs soon discover, the bonds between dogs and their masters often prove stronger than those between human beings.

Episode 6
The Birch Grove elder homes motto is ""Life begins at 70."" Unfortunately, life also ends there for Johnny Jones, a 50s crooner drugged and drowned in his bathtub. It seems that the former heartthrob never lost his sex appeal., as Ash and Scribbs turn up plenty of suspects among his aged admirers and rivals.

The British suburbs look ever so manicured and well-mannered, despite the nasty secrets some of their inhabitants are keeping.  The flavorful plots tick along smoothly.  The actings fine and Granada hasn't stinted on extras, houses, cars or clothes.  The series is fun. Highly recommended.",1411430400,23,5696,4.972544878563886

Usually, I prefer brunettes over blondes, but not this time. The Caroline Catz character (Kate Ashurst) I like, but she looks, sounds, and acts like Catz's Louisa character on Doc Martin. But together they make a great team. A lot of my fellow Americans need blood, shootouts, car chases etc. in their police dramas. Not me. I find the British dramas (and comedies of course) so refreshing. Since guns are not a problem in the UK, the villains, have to use other means to accomplish their nefarious deeds, such as, poisoning, burning a car, hitting you over the head with a paperweight etc. Their banter back and forth in their car on the way to the scene of a crime is wonderful and sometimes hilarious. I can't believe though that they have that many man problems, especially Emma. The show was cancelled after the 2nd season, because the ratings dropped off from the first season.
