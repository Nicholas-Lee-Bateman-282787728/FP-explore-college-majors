2353352,2,B000A2X46U,"This ""film"" (and I use that term loosely) is horrible.  The script / timeline is broken, the effects are third rate and any resemblance to reality is a mistake.  When Cain leaves his family standing there, that was it for me.  I bought this for $3.00 and I paid too much.",1262995200,2,271,4.2745098039215685
2353353,1,B000A2X46U,"Comedic, laughable, bush league, is just a few words that best describe this flop. Activate ""subtitles"" because some of the ""foreign"" actors  are unintelligible (it was made in Europe, but they're still foreign to me). You'll honestly think you're watching a parody of a disaster movie produced by Weird Al Yankovic. The opening music must have been taken from your stock disaster movies from the past. Like AIRPLANE. But I digress.

Want to laugh at a really bad movie that would illicit a ""Worst Actor"" nomination to Dean Cain? This is it. Cheaply made, terribly scripted, badly acted, ridiculous premise (aren't all disaster movies?).

If you can exercise, read a book, surf the Web, and eat a meal while watching this amateur film project, you deserve an OSCAR.",1247529600,,765,4.9609375
2353354,5,B000A2X46U,this was a very good movie to watch.  I do recommand it to anyone that is interested in this kind of movie,1222819200,,106,3.8181818181818183
2353355,1,B000A2X46U,This movie is horrible. Special effects are so bad I could have don't them better from my home computer and the acting sucks too.,1215043200,,129,4.416666666666667
2353356,4,B000A2X46U,"From a first look 'Post Impact' might appear as a cheap imitation of 'The Day After Tomorrow.'

While it contains elements from 'The Day After Tomorrow' it's an entirely different movie and in some aspects better than 'The Day After Tomorrow.'

The movie's CGI and Special Effects are by 'Hollywood' standards 'B' but in terms of storyline I found it superior than 'The Day After Tomorrow.'

It's a good European production that had a strong element of realism and wasn't strung together either by 'ooh' and 'aah' explosions, excessive sex or violence or mind numbing amount of sepcial effects and CGI.

I recommend to everyone to watch 'The Day After Tomorrow' and then watch 'Post Impact' and compare the two, you might be surprised.

Thank you for your time and I give inspirational and written credit to the poster before me who expressed his/her opinion about the misconception that 'Post Impact' is a 'cheap' imitation of 'The Day After Tomorrow.'",1212364800,20,953,4.93125
2353357,4,B000A2X46U,"I really like this kind of movie. It has all that you look for in a good B movie. Obviously low budget writing, sets, saved by good actors doing a competent job. So if you like a fun B/TV movie then this is the one for you.",1207008000,3,223,3.765957446808511
2353358,2,B000A2X46U,"I love End-of-The-World disaster movies, especially the ones where a new Ice Age dawns on the Earth (Psychoanalysts have at it!). So naturally, this movie was a ""Must-See"" for me.

This movie was part of the Sci-Fi channel's original movie line-up and was financed by a German film company (hence most of the story revolves around a post-disaster Berlin). Not a negative, but definitely a cautionary sign, as Sci-Fi Pictures offerings seem to generally be more attempts to fill 2 hours of airtime than to offer high-quality original fare.

Now technically, the movie has its short-comings (e.g. many of the special effects are so obviously animation that it jars you out of the moment - the visuals of a frozen Europe and a cold-climated North Africa are merely adequate) but this is not a fatal weakness.

Acting is generally less than adequate. Dean Cain is almost decent in his leading role, but Nigel Bennett is a sad disappointment and Joanna Clark is totally out of her element (nice eye-candy, tho!)

But to be fair to the actors, they had a very little with which to work. Some of the lines the actors must deliver are so over-the-top and cornball, that unintentional comedy ensues. The plot was paper-thin and soon developed more holes than a New York street after a snowstorm. The set-up is ok although logic is not it's strong suit (i.e. the justification for Dean Cain's characters involvement) but forgivable. However, the final 1/2 hour or so of the movie was so incredibly stupid, the motivation of the various antagonist so vague and well, cartoonish, that any postives of the first half of the movie are duly squandered.

A movie to watch if you're stuck indoors during a blizzard, but not a keeper...",1160438400,,1718,4.829931972789115
2353359,1,B000A2X46U,"During the opening credits of this movie news reports play in the background telling of the aftermath of the meteor's destruction.  One of these news reports claims that the only form of communication still available is satellite phone.  My question is, who in their right mind is broadcasting the news when there's no way anyone will see it?  Also, why is there a thunderstorm in the United States when the meteor is crashing in Europe?  It's stupid script oversights like these that completely ruin this movie. Bad computer effects, mediocre acting... it's all here.  And it's not even very exciting for an action movie.",1149897600,,622,4.9423076923076925
2353360,3,B000A2X46U,"One might expect this to be a cheap rip off of DAY AFTER TOMORROW, which it isn't, but it's not a great movie in its own right, merely passable entertainment.  A comet crashes into the European countryside, sending that part of the world into a frozen wasteland.  Now three years PI (post impact), some crazy person is using a satellite to ""control the world""---for what reasons we're never sure of.  But macho hero Dean Cain leads a group of soldiers into a frozen Berlin where the satellite is being controlled, in efforts to stop the madman from destroying more cities.  The CGI effects are fair to middlin, but the plot is slow moving and there aren't that many surprises in store.  There have been a lot worse movies in this genre, but there have also been so many better.",1126396800,29,777,4.561151079136691
2353361,2,B000A2X46U,"Here we are in Berlin, when a meteor unexpectedly crashes into Europe, causing a global ice age and chaos.  Our protagonist is Tom Parker (Dean Cain), who was responsible for security at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.  Tom manages to get all sorts of key personnel onto the last plane leaving Berlin, but he inexplicably asks his wife and daughter to wait next to a wall while he gets onto the plane, whereupon some senior military person says, too bad, and smacks Tom around a little to prove his point.

A few years pass by and it appears that someone has left a light on in Berlin, so the government decides they need to check it out.  Unfortunately, a super secret American satellite that someone set up to control only from Berlin destroys the plane carrying the team going to check out the activity in Berlin.  Obviously there is more than just a light on in Berlin, there is some insidious activity.  Further, the satellite is now positioned to take out the new government, and governments tend to get annoyed by things like that.  So, a second expedition is put together to stop the satellite before it can be recharged.  Of course Tom Parker is going with the expedition to see if his wife and child survived the cold and are waiting for him.

The expedition gets to Berlin and gets two really cool snow tanks.  Of course there is the usual stupidity (every B science fiction movie has to have some stupidity of the plot stalls out) and one tank is lost right away.  Soon the second tank is lost when it is attacked and the budget costs for the obviously animated tanks goes down.

It turns out that there are more than just a few people left in Berlin, and while their life is difficult, they seem to be doing reasonably well.  Of course, there are those who have decided that they are going to destroy some portions of the world to get revenge on those who abandoned them.  Then there is the person on the team who wants to destroy a different target altogether.  The plot gets convoluted in an attempt to distract you from its increasing implausibility.

This movie is somewhat complicated, and suffers from the complexity.  There is the plot device (the meteor), but on top of the plot device are at least four other plots.  Unfortunately this movie does not have time to fully exploit all the various plots, so one plot I never so coming, and I thought to myself that throwing another, completely unrelated, plot into the mix was a bit bizarre.  I said, ""Huh?"" and shook my head.

The good point of this movie was the snow tanks, though the animation was weak.  After that, this movie is essentially a low budget disaster film, rehashing the ""meteor hits the Earth"" theme once more, but not doing it nearly as well as other movies where the meteor hits or nearly misses (for example, ""Deep Impact"" or ""Armageddon"").  I suppose if you collect movies about global disasters, you should probably have this one in your collection, but be sure to set your expectations low.",1119744000,3,2979,4.570621468926554

2353399,4,B000A2X46U,Pretty good flix. The action was good for a pic. with this kind of budget. Freezing Berlin was a change of pace form having these kinds of movies take place in New York or London.,1373414400,,179,4.142857142857143

2353401,4,B000A2X46U,"As one of the previews that I read before purchasing it, this IS much better than the Day after Tomorrow.  It is far more challenging.  They could have left out the one sex scene and it wouldn't have hurt the movie.  To me, it doesn't make a lot of sense nor does it really need to be there.  Dean Cain did probably as the director said but he has done better.  Still, he's a great actor and I'd give him a gold star anyway.  I know that he has often stated that he adlibs when the director allows it, which is why he's such a great actor.",1361232000,2,539,3.9906542056074765
2353402,5,B000A2X46U,Enjoyed the movie and especially like Dean Cain in the movie.  I have various movies with him as an actor in them and is nice to sit down and relax.  Post Impact is a movie that could happen in real life and shows you what might happen if no one comes to the rescue (a way to put it).,1356825600,3,284,3.7966101694915255

2353404,5,B000A2X46U,"I would give out the background story on this movie, but seeing as quite a few reviews beat me to it already, I would only be wasting time in telling how the movie went because it was very accurate on the storyline as the movie played, so I'll tell you what I feel about the movie in general.

I watched this movie on the Sci-Fi channel a couple of years back, thought it was brilliant, but sad, and kinda lost touch of the movie afterwards until now. I think the movie deserved a lot more than the low-star reviews it received, considering the battle-action scenes and the scene with snow in the North African desert. Dean Cain is excellent in this movie! Another great movie added to my collection. Five stars all the way! You have to buy this to believe it.",1295222400,4,760,4.352112676056338
