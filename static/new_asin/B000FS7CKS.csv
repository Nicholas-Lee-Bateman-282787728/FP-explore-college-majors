8126010,5,B000FS7CKS,"Juste Avant La Nuit/Just Before Nightfall is one of Claude Chabrol's very best despite a few uncertain moments in the opening scenes (Michel Bouquet and sunglasses just don't go together). Rather than the crime itself (which happens offscreen during the titles), the film is concerned with the effects on the (possibly) accidental murderer as his constantly frustrated need to unburden himself punishes him far more than the law ever could. If it's a little hard to believe the distant and somewhat constipated Bouquet is so universally admired and loved by his wife and best friend that they not only forgive but urge him not to confess to the murder he gradually drip feeds them details about, he's completely convincing as a man who wants to be punished and judged but can't even convince the spouse of his victim to do so.

The film has been beautifully thought through, and throughout Chabrol renders his struggle to confess in intriguing cinematic terms - at one point we hear him confess in voice over only for no sounds to emerge from his lips when they finally do move. He makes great use of the unique architecture of Bouquet's modernist house (which gets a well-deserved screen credit of its own), with its bedroom a virtual stage with its own curtains dividing it from the rest of the house, benefiting from some amazingly good camerawork boasting some incredibly well timed shots that reveal and reflect state of mind as well as action. Stephane Audran is exceptionally good as his wife, while Francois Perier (best remembered as the fatalistic cop in Le Samourai) offers warmly convincing support in what should be an increasingly impossible part. Highly recommended.
