7889051,5,6305373760,"Explorer's attempted recovery of lost Russian sub K-29 in the deep Pacific make for an engrossing exploration of how submarines and deep immersible vehicles have been making history since 1960.  I was old enough to remember a sub sinking mysteriously off the Azores in 1968, and this movie showed two possible explanations--one of them coldly probable in an age that sometimes overlooks common sense in the rush to pursue technical innovation at all costs, including lives.  (Would you believe cost-cutting Maintenance?) Somehow the matter-of-fact presentation adds to the poignancy.
Interviews with investigative reporters and former CIA leaders show a glimpse of how the U.S. decided to ""wire"" the oceans...which helped locate Scorpion...and how the U.S. spied on the Soviet Union's northern communication route until betrayed from within.
The cinematography is top-class, and animations showing how the American subs may have gone down due to development shortcuts are unexpectedly moving. It's a short step to seeing how ""Das Boot"" could become any boat.  Highly recommended for Cold War buffs, submariners, and others who like stories about how new technology gets translated into new strategic and tactical advantages.",988848000,6,1224,5.56989247311828
