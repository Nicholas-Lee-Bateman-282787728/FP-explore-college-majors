3120751,3,B0013XZ2XI,why is $199.99? that's outrageous!!I ordered season 1 for less than $5.. this is crazy I hope it's a mistake I hate to stop at season 1..,1375056000,,137,4.111111111111111

3120753,4,B0013XZ2XI,Joey season 2 was great. It is not quit as good as the first season but was still very enjoyable. It was sent to me very quickly and new like it said.,1313366400,4,150,3.71875
3120754,5,B0013XZ2XI,"When I picked up season 1 originally, I thought it was just ok after one or two shows that I didn't watch carefully.  I came back to it about a year later and started a few programs into it - I was hooked!  I laughed with this show as much as I did with Friends, and that's quite a bit.  It put me in a good mood.  They really could have/should have pushed it another season, and it's ridiculous that Season 2 hasn't been widely released (thus the sky-high prices).  As this show continues to find its audience years after Friends ended, demand may just cause a proper (and abundant) release of Season 2.  We can hope.

In the meantime I've been getting my comedy fix from the HBO series ""Da Ali G Show"" - not the movie (which wasn't good) but the original show (which includes Ali G, Borat and Bruno segments) - also a riot.  I haven't seen Leblanc's latest series ""Episodes"" but will be checking that out soon as well..",1309305600,,921,4.283236994219653
3120755,5,B0013XZ2XI,Joey is a great series but the sellers are so greedy. Who in there right mind would pay all that money. These sellers should not be allowed to do this. They should be banned.,1298246400,6,174,4.147058823529412
3120756,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Awesome movie, has many innuendos so it is not really suited for younger audiences. If you love FRIENDS, you will love Joey!",1293494400,2,124,4.681818181818182
3120757,4,B0013XZ2XI,"First, I love this series. I think it was very funny and well done. I wish it would have been allowed to last long.

Secondly, I think the prices people are charging above are too high. I bought season one for $5 at Big Lots several months ago. Which I do think it incredibly low. However, I don't see how the current sellers can have their prices so much higher than retailers do.",1292716800,3,381,4.219178082191781
3120758,3,B0013XZ2XI,"If you like Matt LeBlanc as Joey then you'll probably enjoy the 2nd season.  However, I found that the writing of the script was jumpy.  There didn't seem to be a good flow of stories and definitely no consistent undertone.  Important characters seem to vanish without mention and there seemed to be more focus on characters other than Joey.  The season ended without any closure to Joey Tribianni's life or career.  Overall, it's a must have I suppose for Matt LeBlanc and Joey fans but it's not very well written and it appears that the season was rushed to the end quickly and without a lot of thought.",1288051200,2,605,4.564814814814815
3120759,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Joey 2 season is so funny, is so bad that there is no more seasons to watch, i enjoy both of them, i am a big fan of friends, i have the 10 seasons and now i have joey too in my collection. I recomend joey to everybody.",1277337600,4,219,3.5833333333333335

3120766,4,B0013XZ2XI,"Joey picks off where he left off.  He is a funny, bumbling, loveable idiot.  Alex (his neighbor) and he have a one night stand which eventually leads to her having feelings for him.  When she finally gets over him, Joey ends up realizing that they should be together.  Where will this lead?
Overall a good show, but it is not Friends.  If expectations where less, it would have stayed on longer.  I like all the characters except Joey's old best friend, who also happens to have had an affair with Joey's sister Gina.  His name is Jimmy and is a very weak character.  He also played Eddi in Friends as Chandler's room mate who would not leave.",1271116800,2,643,4.435897435897436

3120771,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Being from Germany I keep asking me that exact question whenever I think of ""Joey"".

It maybe did not quite turn out a huge success as ""Friends"" was, but it still is a rock-solid comedy series with quite a few absolutely hillarious moments, excellent actors and what is even more: it is tightly scipted.

So what the hell happens with Joey in the US? Cancelled within the second series, last 8 episodes never shown. Second series not officially released but only available from questionable sellers who allegedly are selling bootlegs with a official Warner release on the market in Canada? Oh come on Warner? Have you lost every bit of common sense?

I bought the Canadian set, it is resonably priced, quality is OK, too. All episodes are included on three discs, no extras were thrown in, but then again: who needs those? I recommend that set to every fan of the show.

Still, if you are looking for a conclusive end, you will be kind of left in midair. Clearly the makers were aiming for a third series (or even more). But anyway: it is a great series and it is a shame how it is treated by the network and the publisher.",1217808000,7,1123,4.490196078431373
3120772,4,B0013XZ2XI,"I was so happy to see Joey Season 2 on sale at Amazon.ca the Canadian Amazon website. It costs a little more that Season 1, but hey, where else are you going to find this DVD set for under $50?",1217548800,3,193,3.85
3120773,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I'm so glad this 2nd season was finally released.  Don't get suckered into buying the $100 bootlegs in Amazon's Marketplace, or even the $60 + $15 shipping originals on ebay.  Go to Amazon.ca and get the originals there.  With International Priority shipping I paid something like $50 total, and got it in about 5 days.  This show is hilarioius.  Ever since Friends I always thought Joey deserved his own show, and I'm glad they did it, if only for 2 seasons.  I really like both seasons, but the 2nd season featuring Zack and Jimmy are hilarious.  Joey's friend Zack has incredible dialogue delivery with amazing timing, and just about cracks me up everytime he opens his mouth.  Michael's father Jimmy (who had a couple episodes on Friends as Chandler's crazy temporary roomate) has the insane ability to get enraged and worked up about everything and generally finishes off a conversation whilst screaming and storming out of the room.  Good, good stuff, Definately a must have for any Matt LeBlanc fan!!!!!",1216857600,33,1010,4.894117647058824
3120774,4,B0013XZ2XI,Amazon Canada does actually sell an original of the second season and it is great. It is actually improved from the first season. We get Joey from Frends who has now moved to California to continue his movie career. Drea Di Matteo is also still along as his sister. It is a nice very funny series that will be missed.,1214006400,3,317,4.3
3120775,4,B0013XZ2XI,"Be like me, I like the show and for some reason us U.S. fans can't buy the DVD.  Amazon Canada does sell it.  It cost me something like $40 to have a REAL version of the DVD show.  Don't buy from clowns making there own bootleg DVDs!",1212451200,7,233,3.9148936170212765
3120788,4,B0013XZ2XI,As I am writing this review they only set being sold on here is going for $99????  First off these have to be bootlegs because the official Season 2 has not been released yet.  Secondly NO ONE and I repeat NO ONE is going to pay $99 for this.  If you do you are a FOOL.,1211155200,2,269,3.767857142857143
3120789,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Go to Amazons Canadian site.  It is region 1 which means it will play in the USA. More importantly it is only 34.99 Canadian. Which means it isn't too high priced.  I will definitely be getting it.  I loved Joey.  Gina and Bobby made the show very interesting too, and we can't forget Michael and Alex.  This season has a million laughs.  I can't wait to watch it again and again.",1209081600,7,380,4.28169014084507
3120790,1,B0013XZ2XI,"Alright, I'm a big Friends and Joey fan, but this DVD set is just copied off the television and ripped onto homemade DVD's.  NOT high quality and NOT worth the money!

I know the last eight episodes didn't air in the US, but pretty sure it's still illegal to record episodes and sell them as the real thing.",1208736000,4,307,4.275862068965517
3120791,3,B0013XZ2XI,"It is coming out in April 08 to Amazon in Canada and yes the DVD's do play on US DVD players, so like many I can't wait. I did enjoy the show though it was never reached a Friends level in quality but still good none the less.",1204934400,8,226,3.7291666666666665
3120792,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I bought Joey Season 2,from this seller, I know 200 dollar, that's nuts!
But I really wanted to see season 2, and I don't think they will ever realise it.
I'm glad I saw season 2 and I can't believe they cancelled this show, it was great.

See ya,

3120794,5,B0013XZ2XI,"This is a great show, especially for the Friends fans. Please release the second season on DVD as soon as possible. This is not normal to have realeased only one season.",1192752000,3,169,4.483870967741935
3120795,4,B0013XZ2XI,Season 1 was funny. Season 2 is funny. Network chiefs simply couldn't give a monkey's what people like - to them it's just a ratings war. Morons. Thank goodness it's not (quite) as bad in the UK where at least I can watch the whole of series 2. But I bet we never see it released on DVD.,1188172800,13,287,3.9655172413793105
3120796,5,B0013XZ2XI,I'VE JUST CAUGHT PART OF AN EPISODE ON CHANNEL 5 IN UK FOR SEASON 2.  I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THEY MADE IT THEN CHOSE NOT TO RELEASE IT??  I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY IT.  PLEASE RELEASE IT ASAP!,1184457600,4,185,3.8157894736842106
3120797,5,B0013XZ2XI,this was the best show on nbc since the release of heroes and since friends ended. WHY DO THEY TORMENT US BY NEVER SHOWING US HOW IT ENDED AND NEVER SELLING THE DAM DVD!?!?,1183593600,8,172,4.088235294117647
3120818,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Since I'm not a US citizen, I've recently learned that this show was canceled. Apparently because it turned out the lowest rated primetime program for NBC. well... I personally think Joey is just as good as Friends, though what's done is done.... However, they should know there are many peaple around the world who are so disappointed at the cancellation and waiting for the DVD!!! Release it ASAP!!! That's the least you could do, NBC!!",1183075200,2,438,4.8533333333333335
3120819,5,B0013XZ2XI,"They should Release the product or remove the ad. We loyalists have been tormented far too long. We check back on a regular basis for the same results. MORE WAITING! They never should have canceled the show in the first place. Joey was just as good as Friends ever was and it was aired for ten seasons. Matt was the best actor on the show anyway, well next to the chick and the duck.",1182297600,2,383,4.1891891891891895
3120820,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I can't believe that the people who own the rights to this show are so stingy. First, never allowing the last 8 episodes to be shown in the US (WTF was up with that?) Yet allowing Europe to see them. And then not allowing it to come on DVD, and they wonder why people download torrents and get their shows before they come on DVD. Its because these higher ups won't allow the shows we want to be released...or worst yet release one season but not the rest. This is ridiculous. PLEASE RELEASE all of a series. Getting only one season is making me angry...and its not just Joey...there are way too many series that this happens too.

3120821,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I love Joey, this was a great show and for sure you can developed more interesting episodes for our pleasure but bad decisions from NBC wish of my opinion they need to take a look to this website and see how many people are requesting this show on DVD. They should come to their senses and place this show back into the fall schedule in the near future.  If you compare ratings from Joey vs. other shows that made it to second seasons on NBC, is ridiculous, doesn't make any sense and Joey doesn't deserved the shaft.",1179878400,6,517,4.329896907216495

3120826,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I love this show. It was simple and funny. I can't understand why NBC canceled the show. Of course it could not compete with American Idol ( that I hate, by the way ).

At least in DVD, please let us see the second season.",1171497600,7,334,4.075757575757576

3355270,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I'm so glad this 2nd season was finally released.  Don't get suckered into buying the $100 bootlegs in Amazon's Marketplace, or even the $60 + $15 shipping originals on ebay.  Go to Amazon.ca and get the originals there.  With International Priority shipping I paid something like $50 total, and got it in about 5 days.  This show is hilarioius.  Ever since Friends I always thought Joey deserved his own show, and I'm glad they did it, if only for 2 seasons.  I really like both seasons, but the 2nd season featuring Zack and Jimmy are hilarious.  Joey's friend Zack has incredible dialogue delivery with amazing timing, and just about cracks me up everytime he opens his mouth.  Michael's father Jimmy (who had a couple episodes on Friends as Chandler's crazy temporary roomate) has the insane ability to get enraged and worked up about everything and generally finishes off a conversation whilst screaming and storming out of the room.  Good, good stuff, Definately a must have for any Matt LeBlanc fan!!!!!",1216857600,33,1010,4.894117647058824
3355271,4,B0013XZ2XI,Amazon Canada does actually sell an original of the second season and it is great. It is actually improved from the first season. We get Joey from Frends who has now moved to California to continue his movie career. Drea Di Matteo is also still along as his sister. It is a nice very funny series that will be missed.,1214006400,3,317,4.3
3355272,4,B0013XZ2XI,"Be like me, I like the show and for some reason us U.S. fans can't buy the DVD.  Amazon Canada does sell it.  It cost me something like $40 to have a REAL version of the DVD show.  Don't buy from clowns making there own bootleg DVDs!",1212451200,7,233,3.9148936170212765
3355285,4,B0013XZ2XI,As I am writing this review they only set being sold on here is going for $99????  First off these have to be bootlegs because the official Season 2 has not been released yet.  Secondly NO ONE and I repeat NO ONE is going to pay $99 for this.  If you do you are a FOOL.,1211155200,2,269,3.767857142857143
3355286,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Go to Amazons Canadian site.  It is region 1 which means it will play in the USA. More importantly it is only 34.99 Canadian. Which means it isn't too high priced.  I will definitely be getting it.  I loved Joey.  Gina and Bobby made the show very interesting too, and we can't forget Michael and Alex.  This season has a million laughs.  I can't wait to watch it again and again.",1209081600,7,380,4.28169014084507

3355292,4,B0013XZ2XI,Season 1 was funny. Season 2 is funny. Network chiefs simply couldn't give a monkey's what people like - to them it's just a ratings war. Morons. Thank goodness it's not (quite) as bad in the UK where at least I can watch the whole of series 2. But I bet we never see it released on DVD.,1188172800,13,287,3.9655172413793105

3355315,5,B0013XZ2XI,"Since I'm not a US citizen, I've recently learned that this show was canceled. Apparently because it turned out the lowest rated primetime program for NBC. well... I personally think Joey is just as good as Friends, though what's done is done.... However, they should know there are many peaple around the world who are so disappointed at the cancellation and waiting for the DVD!!! Release it ASAP!!! That's the least you could do, NBC!!",1183075200,2,438,4.8533333333333335

Matt was the best actor on the show anyway, well next to the chick and the duck.",1182297600,2,383,4.1891891891891895
3355317,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I can't believe that the people who own the rights to this show are so stingy. First, never allowing the last 8 episodes to be shown in the US (WTF was up with that?) Yet allowing Europe to see them. And then not allowing it to come on DVD, and they wonder why people download torrents and get their shows before they come on DVD. Its because these higher ups won't allow the shows we want to be released...or worst yet release one season but not the rest. This is ridiculous. PLEASE RELEASE all of a series. Getting only one season is making me angry...and its not just Joey...there are way too many series that this happens too.

3355318,5,B0013XZ2XI,"I love Joey, this was a great show and for sure you can developed more interesting episodes for our pleasure but bad decisions from NBC wish of my opinion they need to take a look to this website and see how many people are requesting this show on DVD. They should come to their senses and place this show back into the fall schedule in the near future.  If you compare ratings from Joey vs. other shows that made it to second seasons on NBC, is ridiculous, doesn't make any sense and Joey doesn't deserved the shaft.",1179878400,6,517,4.329896907216495

8253564,5,B0013XZ2XI,"If you like Matt leblanc as joey from friends, your going to like this show. The first season was good and this one is even better. This was never released in North America but luckily it was in Canada so it shares the region code meaning it works perfectly. It has episodes which never aired on tv so your getting the whole thing. Now the show doesn't have an actual ending since it was canceled but again luckily the season DOES NOT END IN A cliffhanger so that's good, and the last episode ends in an ok way to finish the show. It's pretty expensive cuz of the fact that it wasn't release over here but if your like me who owns all of friends and the first season of joey is worth it that's why I got it and I don't regret it.",1458691200,13,729,4.069444444444445

8253566,1,B0013XZ2XI,"I used to enjoy this show when it originally aired . Drea Dematteo and LeBlanc had really good chemistry as Joey and Gina. The problem was that they made Joey more dumb than he was on Friends rather than grow a little and have a little more of a character arc. Example, there was an episode where they made him look like a complete fool at a poker table. This contradicts a class early episode of Friends where he was an expert poker player. Despite all this, I would still love to watch season 2 .
  Now onto why I only gave this a 1 star review, there is actually someone charging $800 dollars for season 2!!! I can't imagine there being any reall demand for it , season 1 only coats $12. Who ever decided to try and sell it for $800, you are absolutely out of your mind",1386374400,3,772,4.14
