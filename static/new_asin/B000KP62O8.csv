8320475,2,B000KP62O8,well cant say its horrible but its not that great. My boy likes it for the most part but has only watched it 3 times. I would suggest skipping this one and go for any of the mighty machines they are the best ones in his and my opinion or the ones with hard hat harry even like lots and lots of trucks all of them are way better and we have watched all them countless times he never gets enough of those ones. This one isn't very exciting to him,1292371200,,444,3.89010989010989
