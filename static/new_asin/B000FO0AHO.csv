2577545,5,B000FO0AHO,"A wonderful film with great performances by Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons. Elizabeth I has deservedly won Emmy nominations for Best Tv film, Helen Mirren (Outstanding Actress), Jeremy Irons (Outstanding Supporting Actor), Hugh Dancy (Outstanding Supporting Actor) and Tom Hooper (Outstanding Director).",1152144000,9,302,6.214285714285714
2577546,5,B000FO0AHO,This is a beautiful portrait of Queen Elizabeth and is a must see for history enthusiasts. I highly reccomend it,1151712000,8,112,4.65
2577547,5,B000FO0AHO,"I love all that is English, when it comes to history, and this is the icing on the cake.  Helen Mirren gives an outstanding performance as Queen Elizabeth, the later years.  She ""feels"" the part and ""lives"" the part.  Adding personality to a much misunderstood royal ruler.  Even going so far as to play pinch and giggle with the younger Robert.  You can see the pained emotions on her face when she is forced to make a choice between love and her throne.  But her heart belongs to England so she lives out the remainder of her life as a woman without love or family.",1147996800,81,567,4.352380952380952
2577548,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren gives a fantastic performance as the unmarried English ruler. She seemed to get the queen's personality down. I felt as if I was getting a look back at history. Hard to believe such a high quality production was created for TV. You see what it takes to be a great, if not lonely, monarch. You do have to close your eyes to a few historical liberties, such as the Queen visiting her cousin in her prison cell. The movie does have a slow start, but stick with it, it picks up. Some of the scenes are very violent and graphic, so beware of that. The reason to see this movie is too watch how Ms. Mirren portrays Queen Elizabeth I. Worth the viewing time.",1147478400,121,664,4.277777777777778
2577549,5,B000FO0AHO,"Wonderful story of Elizabeth and the difficulties she encountered at every turn - never able to live her life as she chose ....still, not too bad to be Queen!",1504137600,,158,4.482758620689655
2577550,5,B000FO0AHO,"SUPERB!  So few movies and/or shows have a beginning, middle AND END! This one has all three and spell binding TALENT from the entire cast. WELL DONE..",1501113600,,151,4.592592592592593
2577551,5,B000FO0AHO,"There is a string of effusive adjectives that can describe this film, but many have already been use, so I won't bore you with more.  I found no flaws in script, casting, dialog, acting costuming, or anything else that draws one into the reality of a film.  One can feel the Queen's fury when it explodes and her tenderness in her regrets.  Best movie I've seen in years, maybe decades.",1501113600,,386,4.485714285714286
2577552,5,B000FO0AHO,I  love the stories of British Royalty and this was a excellent portrait of that.  All the actors were excellent and loved the period entire.  The screens where the ships were on the ocean were extra beautiful.  I enjoyed it and will be googling for most history on some of the characters.,1500940800,,289,4.5
2577553,5,B000FO0AHO,"Loved everything about this production, especially the exchange between Elizabeth and her cousin Mary. Costumes were so impressive. I will watch this movie over and over, and just cover my eyes when it comes to the gore, but, that's the way it was.  Thanks, AMAZON, for bringing this to prime watching.",1500422400,,302,4.921568627450981
2577554,3,B000FO0AHO,A mediocre costume drama. I barely made it to the end. Jeremy Irons is good as usual though.,1498262400,,92,4.166666666666667
2577555,5,B000FO0AHO,"I love this version of Elizabeth I and her later years. Helen Mirren did a fantastic job and put a face to a name that was believable. Even though I wasn't alive during the Elizabethan Era (obviously) I am pretty familiar with the Tudors. I can't help but feel that the original Elizabeth I was just as Helen Mirren portrayed her; I actually felt that I was watching the real Elizabeth I. There are some historical inaccuracies as with most movies, but still a brilliant film. I watch it at least once a year.",1497916800,2,509,4.425531914893617
2577556,5,B000FO0AHO,Loved this movie!,1497830400,,17,5.0
2577557,3,B000FO0AHO,"Love the cast but the film fell kind of flat for me. Perhaps my expectations were to high. Cate Blanchett was so brilliant as this character that I think perhaps I was unfairly comparing Helen Mirren to her, but either way I think there are better versions of this story.",1497657600,,271,4.44
2577558,5,B000FO0AHO,"A superb, intelligent, and intimate portrait of the golden age of the Virgin Queen, with the magnificent Helen Mirren as the embodiment of Elizabeth I (one of her greatest roles, in my opinion). Very reminiscent of the BBC mini-series, Elizabeth R., as it more historically accurate than any of the other Elizabeth I films and has no problem showing the complexities and intrigue of her court. It also has no problem showing the extremely gruesome details of the more tragic nature of her otherwise glorious reign. The fantastic production is full of beautiful sets, costumes, and music, witty brilliant writing and great cast that make the historical characters come alive because they are so well cast. Extras include a few ""making of"" and history documentaries. A must see for fans of historical or costume dramas.",1497139200,12,817,5.059259259259259
2577559,2,B000FO0AHO,"The queen misrepresented compared to other historical films and books as a weak shrieking shrew who needs a man and a boy to function even though she chose to never marry or have children.
Misogynistic at best.",1496707200,,210,4.702702702702703
2577560,3,B000FO0AHO,"The queen seems very modern and not very regal. It's okay, I guess.",1496534400,,67,4.230769230769231
2577561,4,B000FO0AHO,"Beautifully done, good acting, beautiful costumes, well-written. Not entirely perfect (I spotted an anachronism or two). Helen Mirren is excellent. Jeremy Irons perfect as always. Supporting actors also excellent.",1496102400,2,213,6.379310344827586
2577562,5,B000FO0AHO,Perfection!,1495324800,,11,11.0
2577563,3,B000FO0AHO,"The extremely (EXTREMELY) graphic execution scenesthink horror moviewere totally shocking and seemed gratuitous and not in keeping with the rest of the production. As another reviewer put itwhat were the writers and director thinking?? Helen Mirren and Toby Jones especially did a fantastic job of acting the material, and I did not even mind so much the simpering portrayal of Elizabeth. I found her character strange but believable. However the insanely graphic violence, showing bodies chopped up like meat at a butcher, was completely unexpected and has left a sour impression on me days after watching.",1489536000,4,607,5.333333333333333
2577564,5,B000FO0AHO,Love Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons. Historically accurate,1487721600,,57,6.25
2577565,4,B000FO0AHO,A well made depiction of the latter years of the queen.  The film ended with me expecting more to come of how/who the successor is and taking the throne.,1487116800,,153,4.275862068965517

2577570,3,B000FO0AHO,Great acting but lacking in describing and showing what she accomplished. Too much time spent on her love life and too little on how she transformed England into a major power,1486598400,5,175,4.67741935483871
2577571,3,B000FO0AHO,"I liked it less than the one with Cate Blanchett, but it was well done.  An ""older"" Elizabeth.  Helen Mirren is always great.",1486339200,,125,4.391304347826087

2577574,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren is, in a word, incomparable. And here, she's surrounded by an excellent supporting cast. The period and the history come alive. Of special note is the brutal decision of having to execute Mary Queen of Scots--how both Elizabeth and her ministers deal with the dilemma.",1486252800,,281,5.0

2577622,5,B000FO0AHO,"Great production from start to finish, top to bottom. Helen Mirren is magnificent. She brings to life a complicated Elizabeth I, a woman with wants and desires, faithful to her crown and country, and conflicted by the politics and personalities of the Court. Jeremy Irons also creates a many-layered version of Leicester, loyal and loving, deceitful and self-centered. Sets, costumes, production--all beautiful.

2577692,2,B000FO0AHO,If you believe that Elizabeth I was a menopausal madwoman with a penchant for luring and then disappointing young men then you will enjoy this melodrama from HBO. While using historical events and characters the movie is stunning in its portrayal of the persons involved as caricatures of themselves. There is artistic licence and there is artistic licentiousness this is the latter. The character of Elizabeth is overblown and unbelievable unless somehow I missed the part in my history classes where Elizabeth was an unstable borderline psychotic and megalomaniacal ruler. This really is a sad little effort by HBO. Stick with the Hollywood versions of Elizabeth and you'll get a much more realistic impression of why Elizabethan england was a Golden age of sorts for Britain. Or watch this and enjoy seeing Caligula transported through history and dropped in as Elizabeth the First.,1477094400,3,885,5.195804195804196

However the portrayal of Elizabeth I seemed a bit juvenile with regard to her feelings for Sir Robert Dudley and later on his stepson, the Earl of Essex. As a reigning Queen she does not have the same indulgences as a women in a lower station. The welfare of her nation should come first. I simply don't believe that Queen Elizabeth I carried on like a high school girl over these gentlemen. This is the impression that Helen Mirren gives.

2577796,4,B000FO0AHO,"As historical dramas go - and they usually don't go far - this is a splendidly written, directed, and acted one.  Helen Mirren manages to convey every emotion from hysteria to calm decisiveness, from anger to steadfast resolve, from seductive to loving.  Her speech to her troops as she awaits the news concerning her forces fight against the Spanish Armada alone is worthy of an acting award.  She can do more with a small gesture, a raising of the eyebrows, than many actors can do with their entire bodies.  Kudos too to Jeremy Irons - always a delight and here, as the loyal and loving Robin he excels.  Toby Jones, too often overlooked when people think of great British actors, as Cecil, Elizabeth's ""pygmy"" makes what could have been a one-note performance into a fantastically embroidered tour de force.  When Elizabeth asks him whether he too loved Essex we are not at all surprised that his answer is ""Yes"".
  The only problem with the production is that there is no mention of Shakespeare in the screenwriting credits.  You can hardly throw a dead cat - or drawn and quartered traitor - without a Shakespearean quote (or thinly disguised paraphrase of one) being spoken.  Now of course one could counter that it would be no wonder, the Bard's plays and poems being as popular as they no doubt were during the latter 1500s, that some would quote him - sure, but give the man some credit.  Quotations are lifted from ""The Merchant of Venice,"" ""Hamlet,"" and certainly from many of the Sonnets.
  Otherwise a fine showing and one that should not be missed!!",1469404800,,1564,4.705882352941177

2577855,4,B000FO0AHO,"Note:  It is difficult to rate literally works, such as this due to the subjective nature of the viewer/reader/listener.  My review is based on my own experience with a multitude of similar works.

From my review of 'Elizabeth, the Golden Age' with Cate Blanchet:

To my knowledge, there are three primary English-speaking movies dealing with Elizabeth.  This one, the Masterpiece Theater production, 'Elizabeth, The Virgin Queen' with Anne-Marie Duff, and Elizabeth I with Helen Mirren.

I found this production well made, but behind the Cate Blanchet's production.  Not because there was anything inferior, but because of the power of Cate Blanchet's delivery to me.  However, this is a very well made movie with all the trimmings (setting, music, supporting actors, etc.).  Fortunately or unfortunately, the more I watch a historically-based movie, the more the story gets diluted within my attention and interest in the mechanics of making the movie (how was a scene achieved, did they use a crane or a Stedi-Cam, etc.).  So, therefore my opinion on these are also imbued in my overall opinion of the production.

In summary:  A great production with an inspiring Helen Mirren that to me delivers a believable and powerful Elizabeth.",1463788800,2,1237,5.191919191919192

2577860,4,B000FO0AHO,"Not totally historically accurate, although it was miles more accurate than the Cate Blanchette dress up parties passing for real events that those movies were.  The who and when discrepancies aside, you can really tell someone did their research.  Instead of Cate Blanchette looking like Joan of Arc in full armor rallying the troops because it looks cooler, you get the white velvet dress and silver breastplate, just as historically described.  Period language was present, but not so in your face as to be distracting and the settings are meticulously researched and executed for realism.  Helen Mirren was. . .Helen Mirren.  Killed the role, coming across like a real person.  Best comparison I can come up with off the top of my head is that Meryl Streep wins all sorts of awards because she does an uncanny job of imitating a human being in a particular place and time coming from a particular set of circumstances.  Watching Helen Mirren do the same thing and you'll forget they didn't have cameras back then and you're not watching Elizabeth I interact with her privy council for real.  Ensemble was top notch, though lately you catch yourself forgetting that you're not watching Game of Thrones or any of the other HBO dramatic period series because a lot of the same actors go from way above average production (like this) to way above average production (like HBO's Rome) to way above average production (Game of Thrones).  No major complaints.  Only the lack of ability to award partial stars is why this loses one.",1463702400,,1528,4.864864864864865

I think license was taken in the story telling, of course, but for the first time I think of watching any dramatized version of Elizabeth's life, I could both believe and relate.

2578173,4,B000FO0AHO,Helen Mirren did a great job of being Elizabeth.  I don't know if it's historically correct...or not...but she played the part of a monarch that was forthright and protective of her country in the is story.

Just marvelous on all counts -- production, acting, script, direction, costumes, etc.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.  I realize there is some liberal dramatization and editing of actual points of history, but this does not bother me.  I don't think the film is meant to be a biography but rather a vehicle to capture the ethos of an era in England, its queen and its nobility, who profoundly affected the world for weal or woe.",1442102400,,516,4.637362637362638

2578293,5,B000FO0AHO,"Perhaps I'm just too enamored of Helen Mirren to be objective but to me, her performance was great... rather than take the route of completely trying to reflect the well known images of Elizabeth I, Mirren concentrated on the psychological aspects in a believable manner capturing the agony of Liz's predicament in beheading Mary for political exigencies and her angst over not having a child/heir. I don't remember there being a huge promotional thrust for this film when it was released and after viewing it, I couldn't understand why. She was almost as remarkable in portraying Elizabeth I as she is generally regarded for portraying Elizabeth II. To construct a viable interpretation of these two women, so distant in time and manner, each so important, albeit in such different ways, almost makes you think Mirren herself could ascend the throne and do very well. Costumes, sets, the created ambiance, all worthwhile to watch. And Jeremy Irons offered up a more believable, less brooding performance than he often does. I enjoyed the film and think you will too.",1439510400,8,1067,5.033898305084746

This film is a tour de force for  Dame Helen Mirren, who I must admit is by far my favorite classically trained actor. My wife is a history major who specialized in 16th century English history, and she gives it high marks for accuracy. A little gore and a severed head or two may be a bit much from some people, but it is, after all, what drawing and quartering is really all about.

Too, too much focus on the relationships Elizabeth had with the two earls.  I get that there is a comparison going on, and they contrast the men very effectively, but there was more to her life and legacy than her bedroom flirtations with these men.  Seriously, the defeat of the Spanish Armada is given just a few minutes, but you won't miss a freak'n kiss she shared with these guys!  Spend a little more time and watch Glenda Jackson.",1435536000,4,557,4.431372549019608

2578516,5,B000FO0AHO,"This is a very  well directed series, with outstanding acting, cinematography, and costumes.  It is well written and portrays the events reasonably accurately.  On the whole the mini series is factual, but not always - for example Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scotts never met in real life, but they are portrayed as meeting in the mini series.  The production does a very good job of representing the issues and the brutality of the Tudor Period, the love and conflicts between Elizabeth and the Earl of Leister, the stress she experiences with her Council over their desire for her to marry, and using spectacular scenery.  There are issues with the show's timing of different events, but on the whole, the storyline is interesting and moves at a good pace.  As someone who has taught Tudor History, I enjoyed the series and the production's focus on combining fact with entertainment.

If you enjoy historical novels, time period movies, movies that combine romance and drama, or enjoy seeing a well written, directed and acted movie,  I recommend this mini series to you.",1433376000,2,1076,4.906077348066298

Actually, I have seen a few mini-series now on the Elizabeth I, all here on Amazon Prime. It is fascinating to see how very skilled actors and actresses take this classic queen on, probably the best monarch in history!  Yes, they talk about the clandestine romance that Elizabeth I had, but they also show the power, commitment, intelligence, and courage of this amazing woman.

Great attention has been paid to historical detail, and production values are of the highest quality.  Mirren  delved deeply into surviving documents of the time, in order to learn more of, and to portray in the film, the inner person whose personal sacrifices and conflicts were thrust upon her in the course of her reign as monarch of a great European country in times of much political and military turmoil.  She succeeded excellently in meeting this self-imposed challenge and has given us a portrayall of Elizabeth I which differs from, and nicely complements, much of what has gone before.  With the masterful acting of Mirren and the supporting cast, the exceptionally finely written dialogue, and the excellent cinematography, this two-episode series is very much worth watching.  Very highly recommended.",1431129600,7,949,5.251655629139073

There are some other graphic punishments too that I did not enjoy but I kept watching because of Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons, and since he will not be in the second part, I have not yet watched it.

2578896,4,B000FO0AHO,This was the first I had ever seen it since we don't subscribe to HBO.  Helen Mirren is striking and sumptuous as Elizabeth I.  I really want to dig deeper into Elizabeth's life and see how much fact is behind this.  I know she had people beheaded and all.  As I watched I just wondered how England survived with the Elizabeth that was characterized.  But it was a phenomenal dramatization.

2578947,4,B000FO0AHO,I've watched a number of videos and movies about the life of Elizabeth I.  She was such an interesting individual.  Most movies focus on her life during her more youthful years.  I enjoyed that this series covered her life during a more mature period showing her as a more vulnerable woman.  I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction and Elizabeth I in particular.,1427328000,,416,4.816901408450704

2578974,5,B000FO0AHO,"A splendid period drama with Helen Mirren as the ""Virgin Queen"" (well, at least she never married). Jeremy Irons turns in a splendid performance as the Earl of Leicester. The drama's strength lies in its splendid balance between Elizabeth's public life as Queen, speaking as the royal we, and her private life as a woman of passion, daring, the appetite of a queen, and the presumptuous expectations of royalty.",1427328000,,411,4.971014492753623
2578975,5,B000FO0AHO,Staging and costuming are only secondary to the stellar performance of Helen Miren!!!.,1427328000,,86,5.6923076923076925
2578976,4,B000FO0AHO,"Good production. Excellent acting. Only fault I find is that Helen Miren plays Elizabeth as a little too modern. Her mannerisms are more what I would consider 20th century and less Elizabethan. She also isn't portrayed as the incredibly strong monarch that she must have been but more of a helpless woman, which she definitely wasn't. But then I will always compare with Glenda Jackson's Elizabeth so I suppose my critique isn't fair. And I've only seen Part I.",1427328000,,461,4.848101265822785

2579002,5,B000FO0AHO,Love the drama of the Elizabethan period.  To be told have to produce an heir and to have your lover lie to you would be hard to deal with.  This mini series is really good.,1427328000,,173,3.914285714285714

2579007,5,B000FO0AHO,"Such a good film. I remember exactly where I was the day Diana passed. Such a great job of recreating the emotion with the people. Getting to see the other side of it was important. And the queen having the ability to grow with what her people needs is amazing. My husband is British and he has been brought up to not show certain emotions as well, to be proper, to be honorable. This movie portrayed that beautifully.",1427155200,,418,4.371794871794871
2579028,5,B000FO0AHO,Part 1 was the best half largely due to Jeremy Irons lively performance. Helen Mirren was wonderfully and powerfully queen of the screen giving an at times tortured performance of an intelligent and deep feeling Queen Elizabeth.,1427068800,,228,5.1891891891891895

2579036,5,B000FO0AHO,"One of the best movies I have ever viewed.  Helen Miren is fabulous as Elizabeth I!  On a scale of 1-5, I'd give it at least an 8--yes, and 8!  Out of the Globe and ballpark, stellar!",1426809600,,183,3.891891891891892
2579037,4,B000FO0AHO,"I like how they didn't feel they had to overwhelm and confuse us with every single minister or lady in waiting or foreign dignitary at court.  We are only shown the main, relevant people from Elizabeth's reign.  Helen Mirren's versatility continues to amaze me.  I do wish they had shown a little more 'behind-the-scenes' of Elizabethan England (bathing, hairdressing, dressing, housekeeping, etc.), but I really enjoyed this and can't wait to watch the 2nd episode.",1426809600,,466,5.1866666666666665

I also was surfing on Amazon, looking for an interesting movie to watch for the evening with few interruptions.  This one kept me interested throughout the movie.",1426723200,,394,4.36986301369863

This film enables the viewer to truly see the size of the castles, the moats, the courts; in other words life as it must have been in Elizabethan England. I also liked the fact that Helen Mirren's costumes did not change with every new scene.the clothes were exquisite works of art, worn though out the decades of her life.

The attention to detail throughout the film is painstaking. The acting superb.this means that the director did an excellent job working with a truly fine cast Ms Mirren, Mr Irons, Mr Jones & Mr Dancy.",1424390400,,830,4.64625850340136

She is the quintessential older Elizabeth with all the subtle manners and nuances that one imagines the queen must have shown. She is both humanized and regalized in the portrayal of Elizabeth. Irons as Robert, the Earl of Leister is his usual self, practically stealing scenes with Mirren. So many reviews laud this TV series, and I agree with all of them,. This is TV at its very best. If you have interest in the Tudor dynasty, you should get this and watch it in two or three doses.

He was absolutely wonderful, capturing the essence of a man who was an ambitious charmer (and even more of a schemer). The other actors in this were marvelous, as well, but I think Dancy was really a standout. It's criminal how he tends to be pushed to the back burner in nearly every film he's in unless he has one of biggest roles. He's really an incredible actor, and I'm eagerly awaiting the day when he'll stop being snubbed by awards shows and win the accolades he so richly deserves.",1420416000,,600,4.513761467889908

It never happened. Dudley died on his way to take the baths at Buxton, and Elizabeth learned of his death by messenger.

Those ones were not there yesterday more makeup and her youthful admirer Lord of Essex made her feel like a young maid  and an old hag. I believe this show won some Emmys for Hbo as they should.

2579582,5,B000FO0AHO,"I was amazed at the acting and the telling of this story.  It is a complicated story and this movie started in the middle of Elizabeth's life.  I watched the bbc production afterward, ""Elizabeth: the Virgin Queen"".  It was not nearly as entertaining and the storyline left me a little confused.  I would not have known what was going on in the BBC version had I not watched the Elizabeth I version with Helen Mirren.  I believe she won an Oscar for her role in this movie.  If I am wrong, someone should give her one.  I take it Elizabeth was a bit melodramatic and moody at times.  I felt Helen Mirren portrayed these qualities in a real life fashion.  In Elizabeth:  Virgin Queen, the star (can't remember her name) seemed crazy when she was being moody or dramatic.  The entire cast of this movie was excellent.  I don't like movies of this time period.  I was shocked at myself that I watched, enjoyed and understood the action.  Had to be the quality of the movie.  Still not my favorite time period, but I feel better informed about the history of the Elizabethan Era, and the worldview that followed.  I think it is a winner.",1417219200,,1132,4.4487804878048784

The supporting cast was solid, but NOT Helen Mirrans best performance.  She was great, but I have come to expect to be amazed by her performances.

I read up on Elizabeth.  It seems that she was probably sexually abused as a young teen which explains her ambivalence toward marriage.  The film seems to be historically accurate but I would defer that judgment to the academics.  For my part, it is a great history lesson.",1413763200,,440,4.878378378378378

2579797,4,B000FO0AHO,"This is obviously a low-budget production and many of the exterior scenes scenes have rather poor fx.  The great scene of the defeat of the Spanish Armada seems to have been witnessed at second hand by the Queen and about 20 soldiers.  One other complaint would for some historical inaccuracy - in fact good Queen Bess never met her cousin Queen Mary of Scotland.  Despite all this the performances are wonderful with Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Jeremy Irons as Essex. Mirren makes a wonderful Queen - the role in various films and series seems to bring out the best in actors though I'm not sure anyone could ever surpass Glenda Jackson in the now dated and creaky PBS series.  It all gets steamier than my readings on the subject would indicate, but this is wonderful viewing despite its production and historical flaws.",1413072000,,830,4.743055555555555
2579818,3,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons were superb, and the costuming was gorgeous, but there was something missing in this series.

2579861,4,B000FO0AHO,"A well executed depiction of the life and times of perhaps England's greatest monarch, Elizabeth I. In her reign, Elizabeth takes England from a second rate power to the most powerful nation in the world of that time. The presentation holds reasonably close to recorded history; however, Elizabeth's aging is not well handled in the film. As a result, it has been given four rather than five stars.

A better portrayal is to be found in Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen, which holds true to the passage of time to include Elizabeth's becoming old and dying. In that depiction, she ages not so gracefully as do those of her court. Despite this rather obvious departure from reality, Elizabeth I is worth a history buff's and Anglophile's time spent in viewing.",1412467200,,757,4.778625954198473

Setting aside the drama which was incredibly engaging, I noticed the wall treatments in many cases weren't flat design on paper or plaster. it appears to be moulding with the designs actually articulated and sitting on the surface. Try to imaging a floral print wallpaper where the actual flowers were 3D. It makes sense that would be how they would ornament in the 1590s, and without money as a concern.",1411430400,,643,4.4491525423728815

Yes, I did have to turn away from the torture scenes, but it was a brutal period in history. I admit that I would have enjoyed battle scenes from the armada rout, though I know the cost of filming would have been prohibitive.

I am not a wimp and have watched other shows like this.  The movie showed torture such as a man having his intestines pulled out of his body while he was alive.  I realize that during this time in England, there was horrific punishments given.  I just prefer not to see it.  It ruined the movie for me.  I could not finish watching it.

Queen Elizabeth was a pivotal figure in English History and I felt that this series did not really do justice to the woman on the throne, so to speak.

The dialog was so very authentic seeming as were the dynamics between individuals, after all this was Elizabethan England and not the United States of 2014.  Too many historical dramas (The Tudors is one) seem to put the actors in period clothing, but everything about the language they use and their relationships, body language, even their facial expressions, scream modern times.

Highly recommended for those who appreciate tv or movies filmed with sensitivity to the era in question.",1407628800,,581,5.03125

This is one of the rare times when the queen is shown as an astute and very human person.  It displays the trials, both political and religious, she had to endure and triumph, at the same time denying her a private life of her choosing.  I found myself grateful for the insights into a life about which it would be easy to assume there was not much more to learn.  The costumes and photography is sumptuous and authentic and worth watching for that alone.

I had trouble watching the hung, drawn, and quartering because, while I was very aware intellectually of exactly what was done to convicted traitors, I found it visually very difficult to watch. Some leeway must be given for the attempt to perhaps make E Regina more understandable particularly in regard to her decision to execute her very guilty and troublesome cousin Mary Queen of Scots. The supposed secret visit of E to Mary was good theater, but not supported by history. However unlikely, I loved that scene. Architecture, costumes, make-up, executions, firearms, music, all done to historic accuracy; what a show!

It still worked, so long as people understand that it is not fact. For example, Elizabeth and Mary, Eliizabeth and James I,6 never met.

How she managed to keep her court under control and rule the country with a fair mind was a very hard thing to do.

Jeremy Irons comes off a bit better, but not much. He is supposed to be a dashing romantic lover, and, again, he's just too old and doesn't have nearly enough ""dash"". Oddly, the two of them do have a certain chemistry, which might play out well in a more appropriate vehicle.

Then, you see nothing of them until they return to the palace after the battle is concluded.

2580573,5,B000FO0AHO,"Absolutely wonderful performance by Helen Mirren.  This is reported to be the most accurate historical portrayal of Elizabeth during the last 25 years of her reign. This is so much better than the version by Cate Blanchett. Not to take anything away from Cate, with much of the drama pure fiction, she does present a fascinating character, although it was not the real Elizabeth in many respects. Mirren's Elizabeth is more true to history. Her Elizabeth comes across as a real person, in the words of another reviewer,  ""ever pragmatic, intelligent, strong, sometimes silly, vain, and compelling."" Helen Mirren is just brilliant in this production about ""one of the most famous and loved women of all time.""",1404259200,,708,5.042735042735043

2580584,5,B000FO0AHO,"I loved Helen Mirrin in Prime Suspect so watch her whenever I can, except the occasional block buster, because that English acting technique really shows. Her subtle shifts in age, the way she holds her body changes, her walk, all the outward signs signal her shifts in age and time. It isn't just makeup and dialogue. It really is a difference between Hollywood and England. They learn to act, regardless of whether or not they are pretty. However, she can transcend even that and make herself appear beautiful. Really a masterful performance and the story isn't half bad either!",1403740800,,580,4.8686868686868685
2580585,3,B000FO0AHO,I found this version of the story of Elizabeth the First a bit too realistic and intense in its portrayal of the gore that was true to the era (I actually fast forwarded through those bits). Otherwise I thought the presentation pretty enjoyable.,1403568000,,245,4.72093023255814
2580586,4,B000FO0AHO,"As usual, Helen Mirren gave a wonderful performance bringing Elizabeth I to life. Parts of the script that focused on her relationships with the  Earl of Leicester and his stepson, the Earl of Essex seemed a bit overwrought at times, but maybe those were faithful to historical accounts. For me, I felt that those relationships were over-emphasized a bit in this screen version of Elizabeth's life to the detriment of portraying other parts of her character and her activities.",1403568000,,477,5.037974683544304
2580587,5,B000FO0AHO,"I did not see this television mini-series when it was broadcast. But, I am delighted to have viewed it now! The focus is on Elizabeth I after she had the throne for a while, her relationship with the Earl of Leister, and the remainder of life until her death.

Superlative actors fill the bill most amply:
Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons, and Hugh Dancy (recently seen as a lead in the US television production of Hannibal) are the leads. It is a richly produced series with all of  the sets, lighting, costumery worthy of a movie production.

Don't miss this one if you love British history and outstanding performances!",1403481600,,616,4.685185185185185
2580588,3,B000FO0AHO,"It was difficult to understand what they were saying, it was said so fast. The actors did a great job, but the second part I thought was far fetched with the idea of Elizabeth and the way younger man that could be her grandson.",1403481600,,227,4.181818181818182

2580598,5,B000FO0AHO,"This is such a rich bit of history, the story has been told often.  Yet with Helen Mirren  as Elizabeth I the story is compelling.  No expense seems to have been spared on costumes and the editing is also quite fine.",1403222400,,216,4.219512195121951
2580599,5,B000FO0AHO,"I confess that I love anything that Helen Mirren does, and this was no exception.  She portrayed Elizabeth I as an emotionally complex woman, aware of her responsibilities as Head of State and yet also very human.  Jeremy Irons as Leicester was also very good and the chemistry between him and Mirren was part of the joy of watching,  Was it an accurate portrayal of the Queen?  I don't know, but it was great TV.",1403136000,,413,4.466666666666667

2580602,4,B000FO0AHO,"This interpretation of Elizabeth's later years is refreshing, yet difficult to credit. Tantrums are not how she overcame the obstacles of her time, and inappropriate dalliances, while well documented, did not occupy the majority of her thinking, as in this film. I would love to see a politically focused film over this stage of her life, in which her extraordinary accomplishments were accounted for, instead of a picture of a somewhat pathetic older woman not in control of her emotions.",1403049600,,489,5.125
2580603,5,B000FO0AHO,Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons shine in this brilliant portrayal of the first Queen Elizabeth!  I highly recommend checking out this brilliant production.,1403049600,,153,5.6521739130434785

2580605,1,B000FO0AHO,"I knew this wouldn't be a precise historical portrait of the eponymous monarch, but it seemed harmless enough. For the first twenty minutes or so, I was willing to play along for the sake of Helen Mirren's superior acting and the beautiful cinematography and costuming. Also, Jeremy Irons.

Before long, error after glaring error began to eclipse any aesthetic value with which I had initially credited the production. One of the greatest, most accomplished monarchs in the history of Western civilization was rendered, in this film, flippant, hormonal, and naive. It was comparable to ill-researched fan fiction in which Elizabeth oscillates between the roles of lovesick airhead and confused, incompetent, and vindictive spinster. It was at the point when the writers decided that the Earl of Leicester had, in fact, devised the most impactful line of Elizabeth's speech at Tilbury (i.e.: ""heart and stomach of a king"") that I understood the film for what it is: a frustrating but fumbling attempt to undermine the power, agency, and authority of one of the most powerful, agentive, and authoritative women in history. Not only does Leicester put the words in her mouth as she is planning her speech, he hovers behind her as she is delivering it, just as he hovers around every decision - both personal and political - that she makes in the film. Elizabeth had many favorites and advisers with varying degrees of influence throughout her reign, but this film would have viewers believe that Leicester controlled the Queen of England, who by implication could not control herself. His words to Essex at the end of the first part, ""Take care of her, young man. She needs looking after"", are the final misogynistic nail in the coffin in which the filmmakers have endeavored to bury the monarch who oversaw and contributed to one of the most productive, dynamic, and memorable periods in English history.

I cannot comment on Part 2 because, unlike Elizabeth, I had neither the heart nor the stomach to continue.

If none of that bothers you and you like pretty costumes, enjoy.",1402963200,22,2076,4.994219653179191

It shows a side of Elizabeth, the hardships she faced by giving up marriage to several men she deeply loved, in a way that I'd not seen before.

Her affair with Dudley is undoubted, but the relationship with his stepson is overdrawn. Only very rarely would this woman have shown and weakness in public -- her life depending on her strength and control. By trying to emphasize a softer side, this show only demonstrates that the writers didn't appreciate who she really was. A few historical facts are iffy.",1402012800,,583,4.898989898989899

She, like most women, though (and especially then) felt the need to have a man to substantiate their value.  I never thought, from other resources of reading, that Elizabeth I needed men, but this series begs the question.  Did she really?  It is sad that she did not marry the one she loved.  She felt she was married to her kingdom.  This story shows her turmoil in that decision and the results that plagued her and those she loved because of it.

It was too bloody and I do not believe that ER was that emotionally involved with John Dudley to the point that she would risk her life and crown for mire pleasure. She took her pleasure in not going to bed with him. Besides, I have read extensively about her and she was NEVER alone in her entire life. This film takes much license and portrays her as a much different Queen than her biographies record. It is the usual Hollywood way of demoralizing anyone who decides not to marry and desires to live a life as a celibate. Somehow that doesn't seem to set well with the over-sexed of today. I found her a compelling woman with high morals and of admirable character. Yes, yes I know, she did and said many things that she could be criticized for regarding ""her favorite"" but remember she was the Queen of England AND a woman and those two realities made for a very difficult life for this remarkable woman back in the 16th Century.

Of course, the movies were made to interest a broader segment of the population and so fact was not their primary concern. This series delves more into the mind of Elizabeth I, rather than just the trials and tribulations of her life. It compares well with the previous series on BBC called Elizabeth R.

2580723,5,B000FO0AHO,"Short and simple:

If you liked the BBC production of ""Elizabeth R"" with Glenda Jackson, it may take you a while to warm up to Helen Mirren as Elizabeth. Give yourself a chance to do so because she (and the supporting cast) is fantastic.

Like Glenda, she owns the part and gives us a vision of Elizabeth I as a very human, yet powerful monarch.

Where Glenda's Elizabeth was VERY historical and came off as a strong and sometimes strict monarch, Helen's Elizabeth I is more approachable and softer, without losing any of the great monarch's strengths.

The production is sumptuous, has amazing costumes and sets, brilliant acting, wonderful dialog, totally believable performances and fascinating characters.

Jeremy Irons is amazing as Lord Dudley. His chemistry with Helen is palpable, very exciting to watch. These are great actors.

We all know the story of Elizabeth, so no point in a synopsis. This production follows the history fairly closely, but focuses more on the human and day-to-day life of Elizabeth and less on the courtly experiences.

For any Elizabeth I fan, this is a must have!

Excellent overall but...

****** WARNING *****

Some of the scenes in this production are EXTREMELY GORY!

If you like ""torture porn"" they'll be just the thing for you. But if you are more interested in history than ""blood and guts"", have your finger on the Fast Forward button of your remote. Fortunately, there's enough warning before a gore scene starts so you can jump ahead before being totally grossed out.

I know that these events DID occur. So do horrific traffic accidents, and I don't want to see them either! It is enough to know THAT it happened, rather than WATCH it happen.

So, if you are like me, have your remote handy. If you want to watch the gore, then sit back and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.

Either way, give this one a try, it is very enjoyable and thought provoking, just what you would expect from the great Queen herself!",1341014400,,1956,4.765578635014837

2580731,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren makes an excellent Elizabeth I because she plays so well the experienced woman and not the naive Elizabeth I we sometimes see in films. Her best scene is her encounter with Mary Queen of Scots; Helen Mirren plays better a scene when she faces another woman in a duel of words than when she is arguing with a man; her words are sharper and her demeanor more commanding. The slap in the fce that Bette Davies gave to Errol Flynn in ""The Private Lifes of Elizabeth and Essex,"" however, was more ""royal"" than the ""knuckles-in-the head"" that Helen Mirren gave to Hugh Dancy, though both men, 68 years apart, gave equally surprised and angry looks of disbelief.",1278806400,,668,4.621848739495798
2580732,5,B000FO0AHO,"There are countless portrayals of Elizabeth I in film. Certainly, the best known and unforgettable of these are Dame Flora Robson, Betty Davis, Dame Judi Dench and more recently Cate Blanchett in  Shekhar Kapur's ""Elizabeth"" and ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"". In HBO's ""Elizabeth I"",  Helen Mirren's portrayal of England's greatest monarch shows an Elizabeth who has now moved past the flower of her youth into middle age and narrowing prospects of using her virginity as a political bargaining chip on the world power stage.  And yet it is no less a push by her Privy Council for her to find a husband and produce an heir and keep England safe and independent from a world that is far more Catholic than it is Protestant.  Jeremy Irons is certainly a well considered Lord Robert Dudley, who was the love of Queen Elizabeth I's life.  Irons and Mirren play beautifully off one another and the tenderness, even at times when they are at odds or at the passing of Dudley is a palpable thing both historically and on the screen.

The movie is well researched, and the portrayal of Mary Queen of Scots was far more acurate than the version by Shekhar Kapur. Mary Queen of Scots spent most of her life in France and would have a decidedly French accent rather than a Scottish one.  HBO's producers of Elizabeth I thankfully did not omit this detail. Mirren gives a very good insight into a very complex and incredibly intelligent women who kept herself several steps ahead of her courtiers and ministers and someone who was very much the product of her father, King Henry VIII and mother, Ann Boelyn.  Helem Mirren shows us a glimpse of a woman who loved and loved deeply and yet was not free to live as other women lived and had to make decisions not just for her own considerations but for the people and Country to which she considered herself married to first and foremost.  No matter how you feel about Elizabeth I or the times in which England began to truly become an Empire, you can empathise with Mirren's Elizabeth right up until her legendary end.

If you are interested in history, particularly the history of the Tudors and Elizabeth I, this is a film that is definitely not to miss. An important thing to note to those who are concerned about violence in film/  There are a few scenes depicting graphic violence dealing with torture, punishment and execution of those who went against the Crown.  The scene of the execution of Mary Queen of Scots showed that it took more than one strike of the executioner's axe to behead her.  While all of this is certainly in keeping with the times, it is not for children or the squeamish.",1271980800,6,2634,4.626609442060086

Other movies portrayed him as sort of a boy toy, and nothing of importance when in reality, he was a confidant and close friend of the Queen until his dying day.  Even though she was angry at him for taking a wife and barred the wife from court, she still kept in contact with him.  She even marked his last letter before his death.

2580736,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons did such a splendid job in this series that part I is by far my favorite part. This film takes a different road than the Hollywood versions (""Elizabeth"" and its sequel, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") and depicts the genuine love and maturity between them. Jeremy Irons was charming as the Earl of Leicester (pronounced ""Lester""), portraying that he was in love with Elizabeth, whom he called ""Bess."" Elizabeth depends upon him and he is many things to her, though in this version their love is never entirely physically consummated. We see them kiss, and there is a deep, mature love between the two of them despite pressure from the Privy Council that she should marry ... much to Leicester's dismay. Leicester is openly jealous of another's suit for Elizabeth's hand in marriage.  Elizabeth and Leicester walk a fine line: it's clear they love each other deeply, but Elizabeth sadly reminds him that if she ever marries, she must marry royalty.  Elizabeth seems content to keep Leicester by her side, until it is disclosed to her -- rather abruptly -- that her love, Leicester, has been secretly married to a woman already pregnant with his child. The news devastates her and she bans Leicester from court. Seven years later, they reconcile and renew their close friendship. Elizabeth is re-introduced to Leicester's stepson, Essex, with whom she later favored after Leicester's death. Leicester becomes gravely ill and dies with Elizabeth by his side, telling him that she loves him, and that he will always be with her. The chemistry between Helen and Jeremy was exquisite and lends a huge compliment to the much talked about historical romance of Leicester and Elizabeth.

The second part depicts Elizabeth's rocky relationship with Essex, who, with his handsome face, youthful spirit, and quick wit, becomes her favorite after the death of Leicester. She kisses him and bestows great wealth upon him, however young Essex shows an extreme lack of maturity and humility when it comes to these favors. He acts out in rash ways, and she is disappointed by him repeatedly. When he attempts to rebel against her, he makes a fatal error. Unfortunately, it seems that part II was more about Elizabeth's loneliness and fear about growing old that may have contributed to her favor for Essex. In one scene, she laments that despite the name he shares with Leicester (Robert, whom she calls ""Robin""), they are nothing alike ... indicating that she truly longs for Leicester to be with her.

Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast did a splendid job, though Helen and Jeremy delivered the standout performances. These two are highly gifted actors and it is a treat to watch them act together.  They are truly exquisite in their scenes together.  Jeremy Irons earned every award he got for this series.

This film takes a different road than the Hollywood versions (""Elizabeth"" and its sequel, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") and depicts the genuine love and maturity between them.  Jeremy Irons was charming as the Earl of Leicester (pronounced ""Lester""), portraying that he was in love with Elizabeth, whom he called ""Bess.""  Elizabeth depends upon him and he is many things to her, though in this version their love is never entirely physically consummated.  We see them kiss, and there is a deep, mature love between the two of them despite pressure from the Privy Council that she should marry ... much to Leicester's dismay.

2580738,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren is the Elizabeth of all time, with the notable exception of Bette Davis and Flora Robson. But as a more complete portrayal of Elizabeth this surpasses all other presentations.

Mirren has the edge and the requsite arerogance to carry off scene after scene with differing takes on the people of her entourage/. Her affair with Essex is documented, and if she didn't meet Mary of Scotland, she should have. The swings in mood, the nationalism Mirren exudes are fantastic, and those sets! Flowers and black back drops!

And this version shows the spots of commoness of Elizabeth..ruthless, a political animal, sexually driven, unstable, and a bit psycholtic. But this waa the age of Shakespare and Spenser..so something is right with this world and indeed it is..Elizabeth I wantes her reign to be remembered forever..in music, literature of every sort, and in history. She dies on  her feet, documented..everything must be seen and never forgotten, and it has never been forgotten..look at all the films, books etc. produced and written.

A great great creation by Ms. Mirren, and her Queen Elizabeth II was no surprise..a tour de force, a masterpice of brilliance in a form of expression  Elizabeth I would have applauded. Queen Eliz. II?? Never, she is a mere adjunct to Elizabeth I, a footnote, and that's why perhaps the Queen E. II film was 100 minutes, and the HBO of Elizabeth I  several hours.

Though the cast is excellent, the plot  just lumbers along. There is no fresh adaptation of her biography, a disappointment from such admirable producers.

I disagree with one reviewer who claims Elizabeth here is too flightly, too flirtatious, too vain. In fact, history shows her to be exactly that, from her youth throughout her adulthood.
IMO, the best series about Elizabeth's personal life is the 2005 version with Ann-Marie Duff.
For a more historical version, see the Blanchett version although that one tries to cram in every aspect of Bess' life and times and so suffers from it.

He made the Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth's true love of her life, likable when history, for the most part, has portrayed him as conniving and only wanting to be King.

2580756,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren has enjoyed a fantastic blossoming of her (already) great career in her 60's. At a time when most ""actresses of a certain age"" are put out to pasture, the divine Ms. Mirren is proving that your 60's can be filled with boldness, vigor and a true triumph of artistic quality in film and television.

Queen Elizabeth I has been played by so many different people, in so many different ways, but Mirren's take on the best of the Tudors (and England's most popular monarch) is so spot on that the viewer can believe she actually IS Elizabeth. The playful attitude, the daily capitulations, the love she shared for Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), it's all included in this quality work by HBO.

The supporting cast is grand, especially my personal favorite Toby Jones as Sir Robert Cecil (Elizabeth's privy councilor and later Secretary of State). At times, Hugh Dancy (as the Earl of Essex, Robert Deveraux-the Earl of Leicester's stepson) seems a bit lost and too much the boy, not enough the man, to grab the Queen's attention, but the 2nd half of part II remedies that.

There are of course some historical inaccuracies. Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth NEVER met (for some reason, filmmakers always like to include this in Scots-English history), the fact that Leicester married Elizabeth's cousin Lettice (Essex's mother) is not mentioned, and the Duke d'Anjou is shown to be more of a contemporary to the 45 year old monarch in this version (when in reality he was more than 2 decades younger than her).

All in all, this is some of the finest pieces of acting one will see on television. Just for Helen Mirren alone the work receives 5 enthusiastic stars!",1234742400,,1689,4.773972602739726

2580758,5,B000FO0AHO,"This is one of my favorite films and one of my favorites on Elizabeth I. The film focuses on Queen Elizabeth once she is settled into her life as Queen. The main theme of the two parts is her two great loves of her life. Queen Elizabeth famously never married and used her single status to keep and maintain power in a male-dominated world. Her greatest love, which most historians will agree, is the main focus of part one. The second part focuses on a young man whose greed and lust for power gets him in trouble with the Queen on numerous occassions until she can no longer save him from the fate he chose. The movie will humanize Queen Elizabeth and show you that even though she was this iconic and one of the greatest Queens England ever had, she was human and did feel. She had to choose: to be Queen or to have love. She could never have both.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone who is interested in Queen Elizabeth, English history, or history in general. It is a fairly long movie (it is in two parts) but it is worth it. I guarentee it will become on of your favorite movies.",1228780800,,1094,4.285024154589372

Helen Mirren is a great Elizabeth. She captures everything from Elizabeth's confidence and intelligence to her frustration and pervasiveness so perfectly. I love her! I wasn't so sure about Jeremy Irons as Dudley, but after a couple of viewings his performance has grown on me.
What is so great about this show is that it takes place during the last years of Elizabeth's reign, which means we see some of the events that made Elizabeth a legend (like the death of Mary, Queen of Scots and the defeat of the Spanish Armada). But these events aren't changed for the sake of Hollywood, they are depicted accurately and honestly.

2580762,5,B000FO0AHO,"Excellent, absolutely excellent.  Helen Mirren's portrait of Elizabeth Tudor from age 43 to her death at 69 is as deep and nuanced a performance as I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few actresses do Good Queen Bess (Glenda Jackson, Judi Dench, Bette Davis, et. al).  Jeremy Irons is fantastic as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.  Hugh Dancy is impressive as Leicester's stepson Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, though for me it was a bit hard to accept a twentysomething Devereaux attempting to have sex with a fiftysomething Elizabeth after Leicester's death. Elizabeth in that stage of her life was so physically unattractive that I don't think  Devereaux would have tried such an approach in real life, but they both participated in the courtly-love rituals that was so much a part of Tudor court life.  The costumes and the sets are as close to authenic as they can possibly get.  One humorous note, though.  At the start of the film, when several characters are in a hallway, look closely at the candle behind them in a wall niche; it's actually an electric light with a yellow, flamed-shaped bulb!",1213574400,,1108,4.830687830687831

I watched this a while ago, so I do not remember everything.  What I do remember is that Queen Elizabeth, played by Helen Mirren, had a myriad of lovers.  The older she got, it seemed, the younger they got.  Anyway, like I said, the film is very long and the older Elizabeth got the more scarier and creepier she started to look.  At one point, her hairline and wigs practically started at the middle of her head, and her face was covered in a white powder.

2580769,4,B000FO0AHO,"Sometimes it is funny to think about how you learn things as a kid and they stick with you until you go to reexamine them later. That seems especially true about history. Sometimes it is covered with so much banality and rot that it is hard to get the story straight. Old Queen Bess fell into that category. If one compares a film version from the 1950's of how she was perceived and this production, except for the names of the parties, it might as well be two different people. And this is only film. What the hell is the real her-story then?

In the schoolboy histories of my youth Henry VIII's daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, old Bess of blessed memory, who reigned in England during the turbulent last half of the 16th century, had the sobriquet of the Virgin Queen. Of course we were kids then and did know any better about the real ways of royal politics and intricacies of adult romance so that label kind of stuck.

The film under review goes a long way to visually shifting that image as Helen Mirren as the first Elizabeth presents us with a full-blooded and somewhat coquettish Emmy-winning performance. But, wait a minute, didn't Mirren just play the modern Elizabeth and get an Oscar for it. Yes. I believe that I am right. Frankly, old Bess is a hell of a lot more interesting as she seeks romance (with the likes of the Earl of Leicester and later the youthful Earl of Sussex) and the enhancement of the royal prerogative in a long and apparently personally unhappy reign. Off Mirren's performance here though I am glad that Cromwell and the boys in the next century did not have such a ruthless adversary in Charles I. The success of the Commonwealth might have been a much nearer thing.

The story line here centrally revolves around Elizabeth's struggle (like her father's) to enhance the royal power, as is to be expected, but also, as is the norm in dynastic politics, to insure the line of succession. Hovering all through this saga is the question of when or whether Bess will product an heir. In the end we know that she did not and James VI of Scotland (as James I) came on board. However, along the way Bess insured by her policies that England would remain a Protestant country (despite the intrigues of Mary, Queen of Scots and others), that England would become an important naval and mercantile power and that, for a time, the centralizing role of the crown would keep the feuding nobility at bay. Not bad for an old `Virgin' Queen.",1200355200,,2459,4.54627539503386

I have already watched this 2-part movie a few times, for the detail, the richness of the setting, and the amazing dialogues between the characters, especially Queen Elizabeth's lines are superb, gripping, clever... outstanding screen writing!

This movie, although it depicts events from QE's early years of reign, centers on her as a middle-aged queen up to the end. Helen Mirren, IMHO, just won her second Oscar for her role in this movie. Her part as a strong, smart woman who has in many ways sacrificed her personal life for ""the greater good"" is powerful and awesome. You feel for her, you root for her, you even see her pettiness (for being the scorned aging woman) and she makes you forgive her, and mostly her inner struggle which is basically her life's conflict: what is more important--duty or living a full life as every other woman? Her feelings (jealousy, wariness, guilt) toward her cousin Mary Queen of Scots, while we know all the while that history had put Mary's son as Elizabeth's heir.

I enjoyed the history details, the productions is very luxurious, in my opinion.

Jeremy Irons plays his role well, but it is his stepson, the handsome Earl of Essex that steals Irons' thunder. I was a little bit confused because I thought Elizabeth's great lovestory was with Sir Walter Raleigh, but the drama was so fantastic that in the end I didn't really care.",1192320000,,1500,4.62781954887218

I'm not a particular fan of Jeremy Irons as he always seems so cold, but he did pretty well as Leicester and the young man who plays Essex was a terrific contrast to Irons and you could see how he would get himself into major trouble.

She had more character than this. Frankly, I was uncomfortable watching Bette Davis and Erroll Flynn as lovers in a movie that obviously inspired this drivel...and they were closer in age than Mirren and Dancy.

2580822,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth I, the most popular (and one of the most potent) rulers in English history... How could you go wrong?  This is a dazzling production, true to the historical record (with a few speculative asides) with great acting, pacing and production values, and an intelligent, multi-layered script.  Mirren works her way through a near-infinite palette of human emotion, at times hitting the subtlest of notes, while later exploding with the heat and fury of a funeral pyre.  Her portrayal of Queen Bess offers modernity along with dignity and power... The script perhaps overplays Elizabeth's emotional vulnerablity -- there are a few too many scenes of her falling apart due to romantic frustration -- but it is such a pleasure to see Mirren at work, that even the parts that go overboard are welcome.

Many aspects of this production are outstanding, most notably the costumes, which are jaw-droppingly ornate, as well as beautiful and well-suited to the various actors involved.  The cinematography is full of depth and range, with an interplay of light, color and shadow that clearly draws on the work of the old masters of Renaissance painting. The one weak note of the film is the acting of Hugh Dancy, who plays Robert Devereux, the young Earl of Essex, who initially appears as a love interest for the unmarried queen.  Dancy is appealing as a dashing, headstrong young flirt, but falters when the character ages and becomes an antagonist and political rival of the Queen.  Dancy simply lacks the gravitas to make the character believable, and viewers may wonder how such a callow, frantic young man could have inspired such alarm among the cool, savvy members of Elizabeth's advisors on the Privy Council.  (Plus, Jeremy Irons -- the romantic interest in the film's first episode -- is a hard act to follow.  Mirren and Irons simply sizzle together, while Dancy seems like a mere youth, still paying his dues in the acting world.)  That aside, this is a marvelous film, with a spectacular performance from Helen Mirren, a longtime favorite who still rises to new heights with every project she takes on.

Mirren's Elizabeth is childishly playful in her romps with the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), flat-out childish and sympathetic in her desires for the much younger and traitorous Earl of Essex, but when need be steel-cold and harsh.

While the costume design art and set decoration are typically HBO-top-notch, and the court intrigues well played, it is Mirren who grabs hold of our attention. It seems that she portrayed every emotion a person could imagine to have, and did it with pinpoint accuracy, especially the more hysterical emotions.

This version of the latter years of Elizabeth I does not disappoint.  Helen Mirren provides the feisty, passionate, enigmatic Elizabeth one would expect as she moves through her ""Gloriana Regina"" years to old age.  Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Robert Dudley has a crusty, arrogant edge - and the two performances compliment each other. The supporting cast is also genuinely fine.

The costumes were gorgeous, the sets opulent, the cast of characters over-

whelming. It is a lavish production.  And that is my major criticism.  There is so much going all the time that the eye and the ear are

frequently in competion with each other to discern what's happening. And

at times I could have sworn I was in Renassaince Italy - not England.

As always, there seems to be no getting away from historical inaccuracies

which makes me a bit crazy!  But it is a sin all of these historical productions share, and to allow them to ruin the entire experience (if

there are no mortal sins) is to overlook all of the positive.

2580866,5,B000FO0AHO,"Elizabeth I is one of the most fascinating characters in history:  not only did she reside over Britain's rise as a world power (culture, political, and military) during the Reformation, but she was glaringly human in so many ways: she was lonely, frequently unable to make decisions, and vulnerable to handsome courtiers.  Mirren brings all of this out in this incredible reconstruction of her reign.  It begins in the middle of her reign, when she is well established in power, and ends with her death (and so is perfectly compatible with Elizabeth, the other wonderful film on her with the incomparable Cate Blanchett).  In between, there are many brilliant triumphs (beating the Spanish armada) and catastrophic mistakes (such as her execution of her trusted doctor, a Spanish Jew, based on the accusations of her later courtier beau, the Earl of Essex.  Through it all, Mirren helps us to see her as a real human being.  It is one of her greatest performances, and that is saying a lot.

Irons is her first great (apparently unconsomatted) lover-courtier, Robert Dudley.  He is equally brilliant and portrayed as a better and far subtler politician than the one of Elizabeth (played wonderfully by Joseph Fiennes as a man dangerously out of his depth).  While this is an interpretation that is not necessarily the way he was viewed by his contemporaries, it fits with the plot, given his step son, the other Robert, the Earl of Essex, an insufferable dandy seducer.  Once the Earl of Essex takes his place, the drama is racheted up to a stunning and bizarre climax that I believe is extremely accurate historically and a frightening reflection on E I's weaknesses of character judgment.  But she suspected him all along - and this is no spoiler - yet needed him.  Both of these performances are utterly superb and believable.  THere is also the Duc d'Anjou, who is portrayed a bit too sympathically in my view as an apparently loving suitor (he was a cynical transvestite in the other film, which he was), though the doubt is always there as to his deepest motives and never resolved - just like real life.  Mary Queen of Scots is also wonderful, just as subtle so that a simplistic label cannot be stuck to her.  Was she a Catholic martyr?  Or a conspirator in treason?  Once again, as we cannot know, so is this film, these questions are never answered.  Other courtier-ministers are equally complex characters, from the ""pygmy"" to E I's master spy, Walsingham.

This is perhaps the best HBO film I have ever seen.  There is much for history-buff pendants like me, and a wonderfully realised and intricate story.  It is simply brillaint and I will watch it many times again, to seek nuance and different interpretations.  That makes this a masterpiece, in my view.  Warmly recommended.

2580896,5,B000FO0AHO,"This miniseries which focuses on the last twenty years of Elizabeth I's forty year reign (1579-1599) seems designed to showcase Helen Mirren's formidable talents as an actress who is capable of finding, connecting to, and bringing to light what is most human about her larger-than-life characters. In this HBO miniseries about the first Elizabeth as in the Stephen Frears directed feature The Queen (about the second Elizabeth) Helen Mirren has the uncanny ability of showing these monarchs not as abstractions or icons but as extremely complicated, extremeley conflicted, and extremely vulnerable individuals who are, nonetheless, forced to come to terms with the fact that for the people they represent and embody a supra-human ideal and to live up to this expectation they must always conduct themselves in accordance with this ideal. But to live this ideal comes with a terrible price for to live the ideal is to forego actually living life.

Helen Mirren plays both Queen Elizabeth I & II as selfless public servants who must craft themselves according to the public will. Since her power as a monarch is dependent upon the goodwill that her people feel toward her neither Queen is ever free to make decisions based on self-interest but must always weigh her decisions/rulings and consider how they will benefit and/or serve the people. Even though Mirren shows how overbearing each Queen could, at times, be, ultimatley both Queens are seen to be little more than captives of the will of the people. The Queen's every wardrobe choice, every word, and every gesture is carefully crafted and carefully staged; she artfully manages her life to secure the loyalty of her subjects (which ultimatley means that she is their subject and not they hers); and, therefore, no decision the Queen makes is ever a private matter as even her love life is a matter of state. If, in the case of Elizabeth I, the people prefer that their Queen remain a virgin (and loyal only to them) then a virgin she will remain. And if, in the case of Elizabeth II, the people demand that their Queen pay her respects to ""the people's princess"" (Lady Di) then pay her respects she must.

Though each Elizabeth is an entirely singular individual Helen Mirren really understands both Queens to be suffering the consequences of the same kind of extended confinement (which is, apparently, the common blight of royal life in any age).

Both HBO's two-part Elizabeth I and Stephen Frears' The Queen are must-sees for two groups: fans of royal history and acting fans who wish to see an actor/actress at the top of his/her game.

Also recommended to royal history buffs: David Starkey's two-part series Monarchy (about the English royals from the beginning to Charles II).

Also recommended to Helen Mirren fans: The Painted Lady (1997); Prime Suspect seasons 1-6 (season 6 was directed by Elizabeth I's Tom Hooper); The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989).",1168905600,15,2937,4.973523421588594
2580897,5,B000FO0AHO,"If you're a Helen Mirren fan,  you'll love this film based on the life of Queen Elizabeth I.  Another superb English actor, Jeremy Irons, plays her soulmate,  Robert Dudley.  A great film about a great Queen.",1168819200,3,208,4.694444444444445
2580898,5,B000FO0AHO,"One of the things I love about owning a DVD player is that I get to watch movies pretty much as they were intended to be seen: in widescreen format, brilliant colour and sound, and the ability to pause them and have the frame actually stay still. This is especially nice when it's the sort of film I adore -- a costume drama with plenty of details and good looking actors.

Thus is the case with Elizabeth I, a miniseries originally aired on HBO and now available as a two-disc set. Directed by Tom Hooper and written by Nigel Williams, this is a sumptuous treat of a film, full of glittering costumes, period sets and actors who speak and sound right for the time. Instead of showing the usual cradle-to-grave life of Elizabeth I of England, a different tactic is taken, showing her coping with several pivotal times in her reign, and how she dealt with the problem and moved on.

The story opens after Elizabeth has been on the throne of England for about twenty years. She's now in her mid-forties, and her council of advisors are worried that because she has not married and given the country an heir, England stands a good chance of sliding back into civil war. Worse still, there's now the problem of religion -- most of England is Protestant, and most of the rest of Europe is Catholic, two factions that disagree with each other violently, and the only likely heir is the fanatically catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.

Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) isn't about to marry, as we quickly see. She's got exactly what she wants in her relationship with Robert, the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), down to the point where she has him alone in her private quarters, snuggling and cannoolding with a kiss and tickle or two. It's with her dear Robin that she can be who she wants to be, an animated, sexual woman, but she's also being pressured to marry and on the horizon is a visiting French prince, the Duc d'Anjou (Jrmie Covillault), a young charmer who is also a Catholic, and so, not quite suitable. Most of the first hour is taken up with sorting out this relationship, and we get to see how Elizabeth played the marriage game with such skill and ability.

In fact, the viewer ought to resolve themselves to seeing what Elizabeth I did so well -- Elizabeth the Tease. She plays the game of flirtation, and love, and especially, the 'maybe, maybe' card. It doesn't matter if they are courtiers, her ladies in waiting, or the members of parliment. As we see so vividly, she doesn't quite trust anyone, not even her Secretary, Lord Burghley (Ian McDiarmid) or her spymaster, Walsingham (Patrick Malahide). In fact, Elizabeth wasn't above slapping and throwing tantrums when the mood took her, as we get to see. And in a court where she was the center of attention, anyone who tried to outshine her would be in for a world of hurt -- two examples are when a young lady is wearing a splendid gown, and another when a secret marriage comes to light.

The next big problem in Elizabeth's life is the growing tension with the Spanish, and their backing of the exiled Mary of Scotland (Barbara Flynn), who has taken refuge in England after a successful rebellion in her native Scotland has thrown her out, and replaced her with her infant son. Elizabeth knows that if she Mary 'disposed' of, it will plunge England into war with a far more powerful Spain, and that's something that she can't afford. But she also is aware that Mary is more than eager to see Elizabeth die, and isn't above arranging it to happen. Even her trusted advisor, Walsingham wants her gone, and finally, Elizabeth gives in -- but doesn't want to know how it is done, or even when.

It's this little bit that shows Elizabeth in all of her conniving, canny glory. It might seem particularly repellent in a leader, but the sixteenth century wasn't a nice, mannerly time -- it was the time of the smart and the strong, and a ruler had better be both in order to survive. But Mary isn't entirely stupid either, and her execution occurs pretty much as it had happened, with some pretty gory bits.

Mary of Scotland's death leads into war with Spain and the Spanish Armada. Unfortunately, most of this happens off-screen, but we do get the famous speech at Tilburn, and I have to say that Mirren does it spectacularly well, and in a very convincing fashion. But triumph also has bitterness, as she loses her lover, Leicester to illness.

Ten years pass, and a new generation has come to the queen's court. Among them is Leicester's stepson, the Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy), another Robin, who isn't quite as smart as his predescessor was, but soon becomes Elizabeth's favorite. He charms, he seduces, and not everyone likes him. In fact, we see that Burghley's son, Cecil (Toby Jones) certainly is not. Cecil is smart, but is a misshapen dwarf that Elizabeth fondly calls ""Pygmy."" She too, has changed, her clothing becoming more sumptuous, hiding the ravages of time behind ever more layers of makeup and wigs.

Essex is more of a toy than a companion, as we see, and Elizabeth can't seem to say no, even as things start to spiral out of control and Elizabeth discovers that there is one thing that she can't stop -- time and her own mortality.

This is one amazing film. Despite the at times claustrophic feel of the sets and the fact that the crowd scenes seem to be a bit sparse, this is still a spectacle to watch. Mirren shines in this film, and don't be surprised to see her walk off with an award or two come January 15th. Besides Mirren, I appreciated that neither the characters of Leicester or d'Anjou were shown as lacking as they have been in other films about Elizabeth I. D'Anjou is particularly effective, being sympathetic, and knowing it is all a charade, and not the gibbering twit that we were treated to in the version with Cate Blanchett. Jeremy Irons is a sauve, polished courtier, not the sullen boy toy, and is very believable as Elizabeth's longtime confidant and friend.

Some caveats. This film is not for the squeamish. There is one torture scene, several beheadings, one hand getting whacked off, and the rather more gruesome details of what is known as a traitor's death -- being hung, drawn and quartered. I'll spare you what that actually means, but it's a pretty messy sight. There are also two glaring historical errors in this as well: Elizabeth never met either Mary, Queen of Scots, nor James VI pf Scotland in her life. She certainly corresponded with them, but they never met in person.

To balance the gory bits, there are two featurettes that are accessed through the special features. One is a 'making of' feature that goes into the casting, direction, locations and costumes for the series. The other is a rather nice little surprise that goes into the actual history of Elizabeth I and her political and personal relationships, presented by none other than David Starkey, a historian that I have come to like and admire. He also presents with what I have to say is the best description of the sex life of Elizabeth I that I have ever heard -- and no, you're going to have to sit and watch just like I did, because it is too good to miss.

This is not a short program, coming in at about 220 minutes, shown in two parts. Worth it just for Helen Mirren alone, and the other actors are fine icing to the cake. Great for costume junkies, history fans, and anyone who wants to see a woman who set the world on its ear -- after all, that period of time is still known as the Elizabethan period, and it's easy to see why with this. My favorite so far in the various films about Elizabeth I.

This scooped up a mountain of Emmys for 2006, including Best Miniseries, awards for production values and Bests for Mirren and Irons.

Five very solid stars, and I would give it six if I could.",1168732800,211,7781,4.563753581661891
2580899,5,B000FO0AHO,"This HBO-made film shows why commercial television has been steadily declining as it panders to the lowest common denominator.

Elizabeth I (1533-1603) is brilliantly portrayed by Helen Mirren and directed by the very man who directs Mirren -  one of our most brilliant actresses - in the PBS series ""Prime Suspect.""

Elizabeth, who managed to prevail over fearsome enemies, maintained the love of her people and ushered in the remarkable age of Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, whose plays contained the grace and foibles of other monarchs.

Elizabeth possessed a heart and was also heartless, qualities that were both delightfully and terrifyingly exposed in this 2006 film that shows her to be one of the greatest monarchs to ever reign.

Unlike American films, this movie did not contain a cast of thousands. Helen Mirren's teeth were not perfect. She was a woman, exceedingly vain, giddy around men who pleased her, yet ultimately mistress of her own heart.

Jeremy Irons played her first and most important love - the Earl of Leicester - and Hugh Dancy her second, the Earl of Essex.

Recommended reading for booklovers is ""Elizabeth and Essex"" by Lytton-Strachey which explores their relationship in depth and tells the reader more about the Elizabethan Era.",1168300800,2,1266,5.116504854368932

However, for a more accurate and alternate depiction, Glenda Jackson's portrayal in Elizabeth R is more spot on. This BBC series has the advantage of being more thorough since it charts Elizabeth's life, as well as mental and emotional state, before she ascends the throne to the very day of her death.

No mention is made of the plundering of the Catholic Church in England, which caused untold misery for the poor, sick and uneducated, or of her advisors, including above all the Cecils, who benefited from gifts of these ill gotten gains from Henry VIII.  Nearly every person in Parliament had been bought off with the stolen property of the monasteries that had been dissolved under Henry VIII.  All of Elizabeth's advisors therefore had a financial motive in preventing a Catholic from ascending the throne, because a Catholic monarch might force the nobility to make restitution.  While the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots is portrayed as a fat, pampered and sullen rival, no mention is made that she was the rightful and legitimate heir to the throne, or that the allegedly treasonous letter was actually a forgery.  This movie really belongs in the category of Protestant myth.

2580905,5,B000FO0AHO,"Elizabeth I - Quick Brief Background the early years before this production starts

Tudor Queen of England Elizabeth I was born in Greenwich on the 7th September 1533, the only daughter of Henry VIII and his Second wife Anne Boleyn. When Elizabeth was two Anne was beheaded for adultery on the orders of Henry and Elizabeth was exiled from court, her childhood remained a difficult one but she received her protestant education. Upon Henry's death, Elizabeth's older half sister Mary became Queen in 1553, Mary was to re-establish Catholicism in England and viewed Elizabeth as her greatest threat so much so that Elizabeth herself for a time was imprisoned in the Tower of London where every day she lived in fear of her death warrant being signed. Mary took pity and sent Elizabeth back into exile, Elizabeth succeeds to the throne in 1558 aged 25 one of her priorities was to establish and secure England back to Protestantism. Elizabeth was constantly challenged from the Catholics with there many dark plots, therefore Elizabeth reign always remained on a knifes edge, Elizabeth greatest challenge came from her Catholic cousin Mary Queen of Scots.

Elizabeth I - The Production 1579 Episode one

This production begins 20 Years into Elizabeth I reign 1579 she had so far refused to marry there was great uncertainty, without a husband there would be no heir therefore who would succeed to the throne, the consequences were great, danger of civil war between those competing for the succession, England was also in a vulnerable position to the likes of the Catholic powers, led by Spain waiting to seize the heretic Queen's throne.

It opens with Elizabeth (Helen Mirren) being pressed by her privy councilors and parliament baiting her to enter a marriage of alliances namely with the Duke of Anjou (Jrmie Covillault) brother to the king of France, the councilors were trying to find a suitor to break up the Catholic alliance between France and Spain, by marrying the French Catholic Duke it would build a stronger force between England and France, while England remains protestant this puts England in a stronger position keeping peace with Spain. We proceed through this episode showing the trails and tribulations of what being a Queen takes in matters of love and friendship with the Earl of Leicester (Jeremy Irons), War, Conspiracy and Power how a Queen at all times remains on her guard to show no feelings of the heart and keep her wits about her in matters of state. Mirren plays this Queen wonderfully in a light hearted, witty way, with classic charm.

Elizabeth I - The Production 1589 - 1603 Episode Two

There is no more talk of producing an heir to the Throne of England, The Spanish Armada has been defeated and this secures the English nation and the English Protestant Church. But who would succeed her? Who would take her extraordinary power for themselves? Conspiracy burning on the home front is rife, the Queen is growing older and insecurities begin to creep into her life, her old trusted friends have passed on and younger men of wealth and ambition look for her affection and power, one in particular the Earl of Essex, Robert Devereux, 19th Earl of Essex 2nd Devereux 1566 -1601, (played by Hugh Dancy) the Earl of Essex was good looking and famous for his charm he quickly became a favorite to the queen but he exploited his Queens Weaknesses throughout his life. Matters of the heart between Mirren and Dancy are acted out fantastically, Mirren shows the Queens true feelings of doubt, this episode takes us to Elizabeth death in 1603.

Performances, Cast.

I have a love of History Elizabeth I being my favorite Queen, This Production was made for TV and it was a lavish one, the scenery is superb with marvelous visual graphics showing the life and times, and the costumes are wonderful. Although the History in this is followed from what we know of Elizabeth I, history is outlined only in small parts of course the script writers have interceded to turn this into a story line to keep it entertaining, they were short on time so it takes us off track to Elizabeth's real life, a couple of Elizabeth I famous speeches remain  in. (The last Twenty Three years of Elizabeth's Life was packed with all sorts of goings on putting this into 210 minutes was always going to be difficult and the fact we don't really know what went on behind closed doors is also questioned marked, I would entice anyone to read up on Elizabeth I to get a full understanding of the history) but even so it's a fantastic production of story telling and I throughly enjoyed it.

The cast is exceptionally Helen Mirren (This year has been great for Mirren) a classical actress of special significance she made her breakthrough at 19 as Queen Cleopatra in a national youth theatre Production, Oscar nominated at 50 for her affecting Queen Charlotte in the film The Madness of king George and now as Dame Helen Mirren winning an Emmy for this Elizabeth I production and went on to tackle Queen Elizabeth II, playing a Queen seems to suit her very well a women of extraordinary talent (Mirren Playing DS Jane Tennison TV series Prime Suspect is another great performance that should not be missed).

Jeremy Irons winning a second Emmy for his performance in this Production as well, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Malahide, Ian Mcdiarmid and Toby Jones all put in wonderful performances with its great writing from Nigel Williams, and great roles from characters in English History. Fantastic, worth every penny.

Heed my Warning to the faint hearted there are a few Gory violent scenes as part of this production.

2580907,5,B000FO0AHO,"Amazon.com has asked me to write a review for my recent purchase of ""Elizabeth the First"" played by Helen Mirren.  I've always been a fan of Helen Mirren, her acting has always impressed me in that she seems to always take on acting roles that deal with the reality of peoples lives.  However, she has outdone herself in this miraculous portrayal of Elizabeth the First.  The production of the film itself is absolutely superb and created with the skill of a very fine painter.  Most films done about historical characters with personalities bigger then life are often lofty, and almost surreal, though well done.  But this particular film with Helen Mirren as Elizabeth really focus on Elizabeth the woman, with her associates in her life as Queen of England  being just as human.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who may be having problems deciding as to whether they should purchase this film.  I certainly was paying very close attention to Helen Mirren when she played a detective on public television, but I do believe after this role as Queen Elizabeth, her acting career will and should enter new heights of character acting which I look forward to seeing in the future.",1163030400,5,1185,4.802955665024631

2580924,5,B000FO0AHO,"After seeing ""The Queen"" in theatres and being completely blown away by Helen Mirren's acting ability, I purchased the Elizabeth I DVD without having seen it, and I have to say that I have rarely been so impressed with any miniseries (or movie, or television show for that matter) and that is entirely due to Helen Mirren. This is a beautiful story, extremely well written and directed, and spectacularly acted. As Queen Elizabeth I, the notoriously hot-tempered, passionate, and arrogant woman who ruled England for 45 years, Helen Mirren makes us laugh with her, cry with her, and cower when she is provoked or challenged by someone questioning her authority. According to historical experts on Elizabeth I, this movie, and Helen's performance, come closer to getting at what the Queen was really like as a person than any other film has ever done.

Jeremy Irons and Hugh Dancy are wonderful as well, and Irons in particular, as the sardonic, protective, and smitten Earl of Leicester, the Queen's best friend and only true love. Though he cannot marry her, he stands by her side and (with one notable exception), is entirely honest with her, even when telling the truth is sure to provoke one of the Queen's blind rages.

There is one slight liberty taken with the plot; it is true (and acknowledged by Helen and the writers in the special features on the DVD, as well as in interviews) that Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots never met, and that if they had it would have been done in absolute secrecy; the movie shows them meeting but it is done in secret, so I was able to overlook the fact that in truth, that meeting did not take place.

Seriously, if you like period pieces and you want to see great writing, direction, costumes, and spectacular acting, see this version of Elizabeth I. Helen Mirren alone makes it worth watching, and everyone else in it it fabulous too.",1162252800,7,1885,4.723404255319149

Helen Mirren captures the strength that the queen must have possessed to rule England, but at that same time shows a side that is vulnerable and sensitive.

The movie captures the essence of the time period.  Throughout the film you see scenes of betrayal, religious turmoil, and the struggle for power.  Some individuals may be turned off by the gore, but a visit to the Tower of London will prove that that's the way it was in those times.

However, with Helen Merrin as Elizabeth, Jeremy more or less faded into the background. He breaks my heart with his sad, haunted look, and his acting was, as always, outstanding, BUT... Merrin was beyond magnificant! I didn't know who she was and don't think I'd ever seen her before, but she was impressive to say the least. When Jeremy's stepson came on the scene(Hugh Dancy), his unearthly handsomeness found me leaning in toward the tv a bit more than usual....  The show provided much visual gratification and, for someone who knows very little of English history, I found the story fascinating and compelling.

In my opinion Helen Mirren did a beautiful job of capturing the Queen's humanity but her characterization lacks the proud, reserved demeanor that all of her contemporaries saw and described in Elizabeth Tudor and this weakened the performance considerably.  This movie is a lot more entertaining than Glenda Jackson's magnificent Elizabeth R., but it's less accurate historically and Ms. Mirren fails to match Ms. Jackson's splendid performance.  Nor, in my opinion is she as good as Flora Robson who played Elizabeth in several films of the 1930s.  She is as good or better as everybody else whose played the part, however, and the movie entertains.  If you know a lot about Tudor England and you want to see a historically accurate recreation then buy the BBC's early 1970s productions of The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R.

It also graphically shows hands being chopped off - blood spurting out, people being disemboweled and poor Mary Queen of Scots maimed before she is finally killed.  If you have the stomach for all of this, I can recommend everything else about this TV movie.

2580941,3,B000FO0AHO,"I grew up with the magnificent Glenda Jackson version of Elizabeth R, and to me she is the definitive Gloriana. Helen Mirren is superb, but to my mind too flirtatious and indecisive. I don't think the imperious Elizabeth would necessarily have cracked jokes with her courtiers to this extent. Her relationship with the love of her life, the Earl of Leicester, senstively portrayed by Jeremy Irons, is well done, but Leicester did not die in her arms after the defeat of the Armada. Neither did Elizabeth ever meet Mary Queen of Scots (played as a simpering Frenchwoman by Barbara Flynn) or even more bizarrely, her successor, James VI, and Mary was her second, not her first cousin. The Earl of Essex story is more problematic. Though it charts effectively Elizabeth's disillusionment with his ambition and arrogance, it also shows her as being totally besotted by him, which I doubt was the case. Other fine performances are given by Toby Jones as 'Pygmy', Robert Cecil, and by the actors playing Lord Burghley and Francis Walsingham, but for historical accuracy as well as Glenda Jackson's magnetism, Elizabeth R remains definitive.",1158451200,57,1134,5.037234042553192

Hugh Dancy is one of the most handsome men in Hollywood, London, or anywhere.  I, too, would have had a hard time with the Earl of Essex.  I wish they all could have won the Emmy.

2580944,3,B000FO0AHO,"An adequate, if flawed, telling of the story of Elizabeth's  reign. This miniseries begins around the middle of Bess' rule, which is problematic as Mirren is clearly to old to portray the Queen at this point in her reign. Irons is solid as Robert Dudley, but lacking in charisma.  While the performances are good in spite of the miscasting the dialogue is to soap opera-ish, particularly the characterization of Elizabeth. While it is true that Elizabeth was loath to put Mary Stuart to death, owing to her belief in the divine appointment of sovereigns, this production has Bess as indecisive and emotional on most matters. This is highly unlikely to be the case in a monarch who ruled so long and successfully. Also the relationship between the Queen and the stepson of Dudley was overly romanticized, and Mary Stuart was portrayed too romatically. The Queen of Scots duplicity in attempts to usurp the English throne and return the country to the Roman Catholic fold are well established. Also the executions of the conspirators in the plot to kill Elizabeth are reminiscent of a bad horror movie. The largest failing however is the performance of Hugh Dancy as Robert Devereaux, who is wholly unconvincing and lacking in the charm the real Earl of Essex must have had to cause Elizabeth to tolerate his eccentricities so long.

This is not to say the production is without merit. The costumes, sets and photography are excellent, and the cast does well with a mediocre screenplay. I always enjoy watching Mirren and Irons work, even on substandard material, and they do quite well given the limitations imposed by their being essentially too old for the early sections of the story. The score is appropriate to the period and lovely, but does little to enhance the drama. Still, the Masterpiece Theatre production, ""Elizabeth I: The Virgin Queen"", far outshines this one, and so this miniseries can only suffer by comparison. So while this is an interesting night or two's diversion I would recommend the PBS series as a better choice.",1157068800,10,2039,4.921511627906977
2580945,5,B000FO0AHO,"Helen Mirren and Jeremy Iron's performances are magnificent.  This is a first rate production all around.  There are some unbelievably gory scene of torture and executions, not for the squeamish (I had to close my eyes).  The costumes and make up are sensational bringing the royal musueum portraits to life.",1156464000,,308,5.12
2580946,5,B000FO0AHO,"Though many a fine actress has essayed the role of Elizabeth I and done so quite successfully, each finding her own vision of the most important queen that ever lived and translating that to film (Cate Blanchette, Bette Davis, Anne-Marie Duff, and Glenda Jackson to name but a few), it should come as no surprise that the enormously gifted actress Helen Mirren could show us yet another aspect of Elizabeth.

This Elizabeth is set in her middle fifties, a woman still able to maintain her reputation as the Virgin Queen while settling into various assignations.  Here Elizabeth is in love with Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (Hugh Dancy) while being prepped for a 'proper union' with France's royalty in the form of the Duke of Anjou (Jrmie Covillault).  But her 'love life' is only a small yet refreshingly nuanced portion of the long story. Mirren is fortunate to be supported by such fine actors as Jeremy Irons, Patrick Malahide, Toby Jones, Barbara Flynn, Ian McDiarmid, Simon Woods, Diana Kent, and  Toby Salaman among the many standout characters.

The visual aspects of the production are some of the more luxurious ever placed on celluloid, with attention to detail in costuming (Mike O'Neill) and sets (Galius Klicius and Leon McCarthy) that are stunning to see.  The fine musical score is by Robert Lane and incorporates period music with works written for the piece that stand solidly as classical music compositions.  Cinematographers Dmitrij Gribanov and Larry Smith  find the right balance between court grandeur and boudoir intimacy. And of course kudos to Director Tom Hooper and writer Nigel Williams!

But standing above them all is the brilliance of Helen Mirren's involvement as Elizabeth.  She provides us with even more information about the enigmatic queen, allowing us to see both the lusty woman and the brilliant monarch simultaneously.  The film is a joy!  Highly Recommended.

As all have said, the performances were fantastic. I am not real familiar with the history of that time, so I am not sure how purists will view it, but regardless, the movie is outstanding.

Helen Mirren does steal the show, naturally, hers is the main character, but ALL of the performances are excellent, not good, excellent! Every character is interesting in their own way, and every character is skillfully portrayed. I find it hard to believe their will not be some awards won by this movie (Maybe there already has been, I do not follow that stuff).

The movie is primarily about the later part of Elizabeth's life, whereas the Cate Blanchett movie was about the earlier part of her life. If you have seen the Cate Blanchett movie, do not assume this is just another version of the same thing, it is not. They are entirely different. As much as I liked the Cate Blanchett version (I bought the movie, and I buy very few movies) and the performances in that movie as well, it was a much softer version, for lack of a better term, and the Helen Mirren version is simply a better movie with a more realistic portrayal of the characters.

I would not hesitate to recommend the Cate Blanchett and the Helen Mirren versions, because they are both excellent, both well-acted, and they cover different periods in Elizabeth's life. But again, the Helen Mirren version is just a better movie no matter how you look at it, and I do not believe the Blanchett version is very accurate historically, although it is very entertaining.",1155513600,,1554,4.660583941605839
2580948,5,B000FO0AHO,"The HBO mini-series ""Elizabeth I"" focuses on the Virgin Queen (theatre veteran Helen Mirren, in a passionate performance) as she has affairs with the Earl Of Leicester (Academy Award winner and fellow theatre actor Jeremy Irons, who appears suited to act in period pieces) and the Earl Of Oxford (Hugh Dancy, who shows promise, should he choose to act in more period pieces) as the outside world plots against her, most notably Mary, Queen Of Scots. Ian McDiarmid (the villainous Senator Palpatine in five ""STAR WARS"" films) co-stars as a member of the Council. Great historical research is evident, in the appearance of the Queen, who resembles the photographs very much, and in many more grand details, too many to recount now. I recommend this period piece to all high school English classes, regardless of the running time. This production contains some graphic violence, which is not suitable for young children (I doubt that any kids will be attracted to a period piece about one of the greatest monarchs in history, anyway) and may be objectionable to some audiences. No language or sexual content mars this excellent period piece. Rated TV-14 for some graphic violence.",1154563200,8,1177,5.041025641025641

Mirren and Irons are absolutely spectacular in creating riveting, multi-faceted, realistic characters, and the writing and production design are breathtaking. I feel badly for reviewers who can't get over their ""knowledge"" and just enjoy the artistry of two of the finest English-speaking actors ever to grace the screen. LIGHTEN UP.",1519776000,,377,5.5
8124959,1,B000FO0AHO,"I think having a convicts hand cut off in public and the convict holding the severed hand up so everyone can see it is ....well ....interesting. Also, removing the intestions of another convict by slowly pulling them out while the convict watches his intestions rise up in the air is a bit distracting from some good acting. The movie was not my cup of entrails.",1517702400,,362,4.584615384615384
8124960,1,B000FO0AHO,"Both Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons were too old for these roles in this 2005 production. Great acting but I could not suspend disbelief that a sixty year old actress could play a forty year old Queen Elizabeth. It's a major plot point that Elizabeth is still of childbearing age so it's hard to ignore. Also Jeremy Irons is too old for Dudley. I am almost as old as they are so I am not senior bashing, just disappointed that two distinguished actors took the money and ran. Nothing wrong with older people romancing but don't bring childbearing into it! Laughable.",1515888000,,565,4.603960396039604

8124962,3,B000FO0AHO,"Wonderfully acted, but why in the world would the writer take an historical set of events and change them in the ways that were done here?  Elizabeth was portrayed as emotional and mercurial, even in public, in a way that is clearly not how Elizabeth was.  And lots of things, from how long Dudley was away from court, to how old his son was when he died, to where he died, were all changed from what actually happened.  If this was to be an ""historical drama"" then shouldn't it follow the basics of what actually happened?  As someone who is well versed in Robert Dudley's life, I found it difficult to handle all of the changes from what actually happened.",1508976000,2,658,4.458333333333333
