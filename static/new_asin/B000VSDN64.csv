8219720,3,B000VSDN64,"A daughter, of young working age, returns to her mother's house. They bathe each other, naked. A moment of jealousy leads to a surprising response. This is in reaction to the daughter wishing that they could live together forever. ""No! All women should marry."" The mother makes dolls. A supplier wants to order 300 a month. He also wants her and tries. He is lecherous. A young man injures the daughter in a minor car accident. He brings the daughter home, meets and is impressed by the mother. The daughter competes for him with her wiles and succeeds. Later, he seduces the mother with gentleness. More interesting things follow. This includes the mother's passionate masturbation while her new suitor is begged by the daughter to perform again. He does. Then comes the tattoo; a significant memory from her earlier years. The tattooing is painful; excruciating at times, given some parts of the body involved. It's as if her endurance of pain has something to do with atonement or punishment. Curiously, there is no indication of masochism. It's just a painful ordeal. The result is unexpected on many fronts. This is actually a subtle tale.",1314144000,5,1144,4.902061855670103
