8323961,4,6305565430,"OK, Piccolo returned, Vegita saved Gohan and Kururin's lives,  most may not notice but I did.  Why?  Because he's my favorate character.  I wish Gokuh would hurry up and be Super Saiya though.  He will real soon because  it's on the side of the cover.  Four stars because the story's there, but I  much prefer the origanal Japanese version.",936662400,,340,4.6440677966101696
