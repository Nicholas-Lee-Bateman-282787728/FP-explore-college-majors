7794160,5,0970297556,"Lately, a lot of magicians have been picking up some extra cash by selling out their secrets to whomever wants to pay for them.  Most of these newer videos that teach magic tricks are lacking in some way.

However, Mr. Ammar's video is still the gold standard.

He is a patient, thoughtful teacher with an impeccable presentation style.  He teaches magic for magicians -- not to show off.

In this video, he first presents a set of related basic techniques, then follows them with a ""live"" demonstration in which he does some routines for a small group of people, then finished up by explaining how the basic techniques are used to build the routine.  Each set of basic techniques receives this same treatment: palms, vanishes, false transfers, etc.

If you want to learn coin magic from a video, this is the best video for you.  Everything about Mr. Ammar's presentation -- from his easy-to-follow teaching style to the placement of the (multiple) cameras -- makes him the best magic teacher available on video.",1189814400,,1012,4.809248554913295
