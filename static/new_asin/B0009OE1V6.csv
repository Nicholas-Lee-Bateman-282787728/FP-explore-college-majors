Tanya Roberts who is always nice to look at and in her film debut is the ultimate target for Max. Also keep a look out for Nancy(CARRIE-ROBOCOP)Allen in her film debut as well. Originally titled THE LAST VICTIM TO THE RIGHT (""sheesh"") Watching a blank screen is more interesting.  The one star is for Tanya Roberts killing the idiot and parading around in her denim Daisey Dukes",1217721600,5,640,4.47008547008547

2693038,3,B0009OE1V6,"Honestly this is not one of my favorite films, but it could be considered a classic grindhouse/B-movie/porn type of film for some collectors.

2693039,4,B0009OE1V6,"The Capt. had never heard of this '70's film before reading about it here at Amazon.  So, I purchased it to see what all the fuss was about.

Yes...this film (that could never be made today) had hard core sex scenes in it.  There were three, one oral, one from behind, and one lesbian scene.  The price for these hot rape/sex scenes is the non-stop flashback scenes of the Vietnam war!  I know the director is (constantly) attempting to imply this murderous rapist is mentally disturbed by his time spent in Vietnam, but it really got old quick.  Over and over again, during some hot violent sex, there are black and white ""flashbacks"" to scenes of the war.  It ruined what were otherwise somewhat hot scenes.

Its also too bad these actresses were not that hot looking.  There is more 'hairy beavers' in this film than a nudist commune in Berkeley!  It looks so dated by today's standards.  The rape scene of the woman in her apartment was quite realistic, and very well done, but as I stated, those Vietnam flashbacks take their toll on you after a while.

The picture and sound quality were both terrible....one of the worst films (quality) I've ever owned on DVD.

If you are looking to get off with your girlfriend while watching something very freaky....this will definately do the trick.  The problem is, most women 'may' find these three rape scenes a bit too realistic to make them horny.  I said ""may"" because if your girlfriend's undies are drenched while watching this hard core film with you....you are dating a serious freak dudes!  When it comes time to get it on with your woman after watching the stabbing scene...you'll know how much of a freak your girl is...especially if you do not have to make a ""forced entry""! ;)

The Capt. has spoken.....!",1202688000,27,1764,4.638709677419355
2693040,2,B0009OE1V6,"This film is an acquired taste. Definitely not for everyone, and obviously a product of its time. Its not an enjoyable film to watch and despite all the violence and degradation, it is also rather monotonous. However, it is worth checking out if you are an afficionado of the sleazy 42nd street Grindhouse genre. The film is very basic in its production values, but what sets this film apart is its attempt at including a wider social commentary about Vietnam vets coming home damaged and scarred by what they have been exposed to in combat. Credit should also be given to Harry Reems for his vivid performance. He certainly succeeds in creating a despicable character. Basically the film's purpose is to present a sequence of violent sexual attacks on women. However, I give the director credit for his use of Vietnam War stock footage to create atmosphere. I believe Gaspar Noe would have been influenced by this film for HIS notorious rape scene in Irreversible. Overall, this is not the type of film you would want to view again or even recommend, but I am happy to have it in my collection as I am a fan of the Grindhouse ""genre""
NB: Not for the faint hearted or easily disturbed. The sex is explicit and the language is VERY brutal and misogynistic. The existence of this film makes you wonder what audience the director had in mind.",1200268800,36,1339,4.654008438818566
2693041,4,B0009OE1V6,"Be aware that this is not the same film that just came out on DVD recently bearing the title Forced Entry. That film is a hardcore sex movie which coincidentally was made around the same year as this one and has nothing to do with this one.
This film's alternate title is The Last Victim and stars Tanya Roberts as the female lead role. To avoid confusion look up the title on imdb.com.
For lack of a more articulate description, I would say this is like Joe Spinell film Maniac except the focus is more on the sexual perversion and assault rather than gory killing scenes. This film is not for the squeamish, to say the least. The killer's demented, misogynistic thoughts narrate most of the movie, which follows him as he rides around town in his car looking for victims. In the end he spots Tanya Roberts and holds her captive inside her own home. If you liked Maniac and I Spit On Your Grave then you will probably enjoy this one. Personally I think it is a more interesting film than most of the grindhouse exploitation films that are about rapists. This one has a much scarier psychopath and after hearing what this guy is thinking all the time it reminded me there are alot of sickos out there and their minds simply do not work the way that a normal person's does.

2693043,4,B0009OE1V6,"The most significant thing about this flick is Laura Cannon's performance - she was obviously a competent actress who took her role seriously, as well as being much prettier than can be expected in a film of this type.

The only problem is that her performance as a rape victim was almost TOO good for a porn movie. She projected the pain and terror a woman would really feel in that situation so well that I started to empathize with her. And that is not a good thing in a porn movie, because you are not turned on if you are made to sympathize with the ""victim"". You want to suspend your own ethical code for a while, and see her as an object, precisely because a normal person can't do that in real life.

I hope Laura - or whatever her real name was - managed to break into ""legitimate"" acting. She certainly had the looks and the talent.",1188604800,73,842,4.25625
2693044,2,B0009OE1V6,"""Forced Entry"" is a sexually explicit and violent film dealing with a crazed Vietnam vet and his psychopathic tendencies to rape and kill women. It is a prime example of early seventies adult and grindhouse films. The sex scenes are of the hardcore variety and according to the liner notes by the director, the rest of the film was created to allow for compliance with the then current obscenity laws of the country. ""Forced Entry"" is really nothing more than a porn film masquerading as a ""socially relevant"" study of a war damaged individual. The low budget roots of this film are evident as there are mutiple instances of things like the microphone being clearly visible. Check out the initial gas station sequence and a much more humorous hardcore segment later on where the mic slides into the frame. The DVD print is ravaged, lines, blotches and many other imperfections throughout the whole film. This is probably the best that could be expected from this type of film but if you are looking for some sort of pristine print you will be disappointed. I would not recommend paying a premium price for this film on DVD. However, it is a film worth seeing if you are into the history of subversive film. I don't believe this disc is worth the asking price but it is worth seeing once.",1186358400,122,1287,4.649122807017544

All we watch is how he did those action, including torture and sodomize, of couse in triple X style (what can you expect?).

I've been wanting to see this for over ten years and was excited when I finally got the chance. After watching it I realized it wasn't as rough/violent as it sounded, either, in my opinion. The 'rape' and manhandling of women in R-rated films is far rougher than what's in his film. I see this more as a mainstream film with explicit sex as opposed to a xxx porn with a plot. This features two oral rapes, one anal, and has one long m/f explicit sex scene near the beginning and one lesbian oral scene at the end

There's not too much dialogue in this and Harry has most of it. The scene at the end with the two women, they're beyond annoying and they sort of ruined the ending for me. From what I've read they weren't really actors and it seems to me they were ad-libbing most of their dialogue. They couldn't have done a worse job had they tried.

8157719,2,B0009OE1V6,"A psychotic guy who goes around forcing women to give him oral sex! It's a nice concept, but if you're going to do a movie like this, you need to be prepared to do a bit more than what an R-rated movie does! Not that this doesn't do a bit more, but in actuality--ONLY a bit!!! The problem with a lot of these X-rated movies is the tendency they have to pay too much attention to the nudity. This causes the movie to lose its potency and effect. The incompetent morons who make these movies don't realize that they defeat their purpose entirely when they start paying too much attention to the nudity! Whatever statement they are trying to make gets lost in the ether! Relax idiots! Just shoot the movie the way you'd shoot it if the actors were wearing clothes and you'll do fine! When the viewer is thinking too much about the camera and editing, YOU'RE NOT MAKING A GOOD MOVIE!!!

About the only graphic thing this movie shows is the oral sex!--Female Head & Male Organ, in other words! Aside from that it's mostly R-rated B.S. At the same time, the movie only really features 2 rapes, despite the fact that it's supposed to be about a serial rapist.

In truth, this still may be a good movie to watch, but for its cost, I'd recommend skipping it. Definitely not worth more than about $10.00 total. CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE $25+ DOLLARS THESE SELLERS ARE CHARGING! Wait until the morons who are selling this movie charge what it's actually worth before purchasing!

There is no live sound, as with virtually all dirty loops of this era, but who needs it.
