8246608,4,B0012KO8PU,"Quality set with lesser-known classics aand near-classics. For thi Reviewer, the first up to bat, The Chimp..is the Champ. (The movie title it is based upon).

It appears that this is the authentic, full-length version - it's hard to tell, I believe, with all the third-generation, TV-edited versions out there.

The Chimp (*****) is certainly one of the funniest 2-reelers ever made. though not regarded as on the level of The Music Box or Helpmates, this brilliant work from that same year, 1932, has a higher laugh content, in fact, loud, sustained laughs. The dialogue is wonderful as are the visuals - not to ""spoil"" any surprise for the unititiated - but the impromptu 3:00am dance by the ""Human"" gorilla is almost too much. The editing and pacing are tops.

Just like many other comedy teams, whether on film or TV, L & h had a [small] learning curve, or *adjustment* from silent to sound and the 1929 entries here show some awkwardness, i.e. too many reaction cutaways, action too slow, etc.

The weakest two-reeler they ever made is here, They Go Boom, (**), but let's remember that this movie is perhaps the rarest of the ""soundies"" - for some reason it was not commercially available until the '90s, as I recall. This is a strange short subject, isolated to one set, a depressing rooming house deal, with Stan and Ollie never getting out of their nightshirts. It's midly funny in spots, but Stan as male Nurse is never really cultivated.

The Hoosegow, (*** 1/2*) with the Boys on a chain gang without the chain, is worth watching, but the plotline and gags are tired. Finlayson, as Governor, is on hand, though, to bring some welcome smiles to the viewer.

Along with Boom, we have another late-comer to the video market, the very first non-silent, shall we say, Unaccustomed As We Are. (*** 1/2*). If you've seen Blockheads, then, in a way, you've seen this one, albeit, in a very nascent form. The L & H troupe really delivers, including mae Busch as Hardy's wife, with Thelma Todd as Edgar Kennedy's spouse (Kennedy ofcourse does the Gilbert role from 9 years later); and Stan, as the surprise houseguest. Ofcourse, Mrs. Hardy registers her own kind of surprise...priceless.

I'm not schooled in L & H movie variations, or in what is considered top quality, but the audio-video seems very high quality.",1309564800,,2317,4.7775
