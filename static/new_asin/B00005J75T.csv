1427911,5,B00005J75T,How could anyone who loves the violin rate this at less than five stars? Nadja's passionate playing leaves me quite breathless.,1051228800,7,127,5.095238095238095
1427912,5,B00005J75T,"This is an incredible movie revealing the soul of a sensitive performer, I thoroughly enjoyed her honesty and anything-but-ordinary performances. When I saw this movie I could not stop crying. It just goes to show how such a great talent can be lost when love goes bad. Just like Nadja's mom said it takes alot of guts to be happy.
Nadja, if you're out there and reading this you will never know how you have touched my life, how you reminded me how delicate life really is. I am a musician too and am terribly fond of you, please look me up sometime Im sure we would have alot to talk about.
All I can think of is thank god that gun jammed!",1049155200,8,641,4.219512195121951
1427913,4,B00005J75T,"Watching this movie made me realize a few things:
1) the fact that I never liked her has lot to do with her appearance and certain attitude.
2)it must be very hard to be different in this rigid world of classical music.
I found myself to examine my prejudices and i find myself actually liking this fine violinist.",1043193600,3,314,4.431034482758621
1427914,5,B00005J75T,"Here we have a warts-and-all documentary of one of the greatest violinists of our day. In addition to her superb playing, we see all sides of Nadja -- charming, annoying, frightening. A riveting production that I will watch again and again.",1023580800,5,240,4.878048780487805
1427915,5,B00005J75T,"I came home from the opera one day, and my family said that I should watch this program on Nadja Sonnenberg.  This interested me greatly being an aspiring violist for 6 years.  I expected the documentary to be about her accomplishments and how great of a violinist she is.  I was very surprised!  Watching Nadja play, and listening to her story made me fall in love with classical music all over again.  She told how hard it was being a woman in the classical music scene.  The critics bashed her in the beginning until they saw what hidden talent was in her fingers.  Nadja plays with so much emotion it is impossible for me to describe, but all i can say is watch the movie!!!!!  She left the audience jealous of her talent, and inspired with her words of wisdom.  The best part about this documentary is that you saw this virtuoso as a real person who had problems throughout her life.  Every time I pick up my instrument I try to play with as much emotion as Nadja does.  She has definately been an inspiration to me since I watched ""Speaking in Strings.",991612800,6,1058,4.402061855670103
1427950,5,B00005J75T,"As in any fine work of art, Paola di Florio combines substance and allusion to touch the strings of the viewer's own emotions and experience. Nadja's purported ""bad girl"" persona seems less important than the ""person"" who emerges brassy but sincere, intimate but not maudlin---and whose natural capacity for ""feeling"" fuels a full range of expression, musical and otherwise. Despite the battery and/or cigarette butt analogy, the film seems largely about love and rediscovered love: grandparent/grandchild, mother/daughter, friends, lovers, life, art---the many layers of which are drawn together by the words of an Italian Christmas carol: ""Ah, how much it cost you to have loved me so..."" I've read some reviews---and will admit that the film is probably not for the kindergarten class in evolutionary personhood; one needs to be part of the same spiritual ""kumpania"" to fully appreciate it.",1233792000,,893,5.385714285714286
1427951,5,B00005J75T,"I saw this documentary when it was aired on PBS and it made me want to run out in the New York winter and buy every recording Salerno-Sonnenberg ever made. There is footage of her playing winning a competition with the Shostakovich concerto. She seems demonically possessed. She gives you the feeling music is something worth dying for (and living for).

Every musician, nay-- every aspiring artist, nay anyone aspiring in any field of discipline, nay -- every one living, should watch this video for a massive dose of inspiration and enthusiasm for life and art.",1189468800,3,563,4.864583333333333
1427952,5,B00005J75T,"I think I had heard of SPEAKING IN STRINGS, in passing, when it first came out in 1998.  However, I only knew that it was about Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, a phenomenally talented violinst.  This woman has been called ""possessed,"" ""frightening"" and ""brilliant"" with good reason.  I can honestly say that I have never heard (or seen) such an incomparable artist perform great classical pieces with such fire and spirit.  Nadja has been criticized as much as she has been proclaimed.  The intensity of her connection to the music is so strong that she has the tendency to contort her face and physicalize the mood of the pieces she interprets.  This, of course, has generated criticism from the press.  For me, Nadja really is feeling the essence of the music she expresses through her instrument.

Not only do we hear great excerpts from some of Nadja's finest performances (including her Carnegie Hall debut, at the age of seventeen in 1982, and an interview with Johnny Carson), as well as a really engrossing look at her formative years (complete with clips from home movies and family photos).  We also see a very intimate side of Solerno-Sonnenberg and we really see the personal setbacks that almost put a permanent end to her career.  Director Paola di Fiorio was granted a well-earned Academy Award nomination for Best Documementary, and you don't have to look too closely to see why.",1181692800,3,1389,4.897435897435898
1427953,4,B00005J75T,"This documentary provides us with a glimpse into the life of a most unusual violinist. Certainly Ms Salerno-Sonnenberg has rightful status as a proficient performer, but beyond that she is well known for her unusual stage presence. She almost literally throws herself into her performance providing the audience with a physical rendition of the music in addition to playing her instrument.

I said above that we get a glimpse of her life, and that is all one can hope for in a 75 minute movie. What we learn here once again  is that we can't idealize the lives of talented performers. Nadja's life is a hectic one consisting of up to 200 performances a year. The stress of this routine is manifested in bouts of depression which on one occasion becomes suicidal.

While watching the movie I couldn't help thinking of Jaqueline du Pre, the demonstrative cellist who led a tragic life. Ms Salerno-Sonnenberg tells us that she really feels free only when she is actually performing.

Now to the disappointment. Listening to her recorded performances is very rewarding, but it can be like listening to a Shakespeare play on the radio. The visual part of her playing is an important part of the listening experience. Many of us may never be able to watch her play so I had hoped that the documentary would give us a good sampling of her on stage efforts, but unfortunately the clips of her playing the violin are few, and never more than 60 seconds in length. I wish they had extended the movie another 15 minutes and treated us to the performance of at least one composition.  It is for the reason that I gave a rating of four stars instead of five.",1174089600,10,1645,4.639175257731959
1427954,5,B00005J75T,"Although I haven't watched this DVD yet, I am pleased that it was available on Amazon.",1173312000,,86,4.4375
1427955,5,B00005J75T,"This is a landmark documentary of home movies, videos, powerful stills and original camera work supported by a unique sound track teasing scenes with audio precursors enabling fast cuts in places where dissolves would be used by less an artist than producer-director Paola di Florio.
Of course Nadja is manic.  What could be more unsettling than going from the applause of Carnegie Hall to a lonely life with endless hours of practice, personal denial and dreams that seem more than a little insane?
She is in the prison of great talent.  We, who don't know such highs and lows have no way to understand much less judge.
That Nadja is an Italian immigrant, working class; street-smart, scrappy New Yorker drives the aristocracy of the music intelligentsia nuts.  How dare she poke into the parlors of the high born and challenge their grip on an art?  Blinded by their own glitter, they cannot see that she is a hope for classical music. Her success is an inspiration to the young of all classes proving once again that America works, The New York Times notwithstanding.  Careers are open to talent in our free enterprise economy.  It is a system that creates what it needs.  We needed a Nadja to show the world that classical music is not just for snobs.
Nadja's detractors want to tell us what we like much as their kind have long told us what to think. But, the people are not buying it any more.  If Nadja attacks the music with powerful skills we applaud in spite of the blue bloods and not because of them.  That makes them crazy.  They arrogantly tell us dead composers would not like what Nadja does.  Composers only write the outlines.  Players bring their work to life.  We believe every composer would applaud her.
Reviewer Bernard Chapin made outrageous errors in his analysis of this film.  He accused Nadja of having said, ""...classical music is a joke,"" when she actually said, ""...classical music is a job,"" perhaps reflecting her working class regard for employment further offending the effete ear of Chapin.  The sound track is thin at this point so this mistake may have been honest, but when he picked out ""The only time I feel good is when I play,"" for his review title he stooped to distortion as she said this only for the time she had a flu.  This is very clear misrepresentation by Mr. Chapin.  But, he tops this with allusions to her homosexuality in response to the friendship shown Nadja by her female friends.  He clearly has no acquaintance with the battlefield mentality of creative people and the kinds of friendships that forms.  The only moments where Nadja is seen in anything like an intimate moment with anyone are a still photo with Mr. Mandy Potinkin and rubbing the arm of friend Mats Lidstrom in a textbook hominid friendship gesture plus her smiling expressions while playing in an ensemble, all to men.  In the Tonight Show appearance shown her conversation is all about her recently having ""broken up"" with a ""boyfriend."" And, her scene with the fortune teller where she is told ""you will make your family in a year"" her response is, ""So there will be at least one child in my life..."" and expresses she is happy to hear it. From where comes Chapin's homosexual idea but from the depths of a distorting, destructive, sick mind.",1147219200,4,3272,4.697022767075307
1427956,4,B00005J75T,"This is a very interesting film as its subject, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, possesses a unique, and Van Goghian, combination of talent and emotional disturbance. So often unfortunately, people mistake depression and over-emotionality as being valuable and indicative of deep vision, when they are in fact just a tragic malady. We now know from experiments on the brain conducted over the course of the last decade just how much depression harms mental functioning. Sonnenberg does not strike the viewer as being a particularly perceptive person. This is painfully on display when she tries to explain what her artwork means-she doesn't appear to know, so she makes it up as she goes along.

Some critics described her work as ""hormonal"" and ""distortive,"" and it's hard not to agree in the scenes of her frenetically shaking about on the stage. It seems that her personality overpowers the music, but such a personality makes for excellent character study which is why this is a useful documentary. Occasionally, her maudlin self wanders into offensiveness such as when she states, ""classical music is a joke."" Well, is it? Not to those of us who spent money to see the film. Her emotional fragility is something that she projects upon the rest of us. When she cuts off her finger tip, one has to wonder why somebody isn't on camera pointing out that the act may have been unconsciously motivated because it could have ended a career of which she is very ambivalent. She also tries to kill herself due to what her friends' term, ""existential depression,"" but this is poppycock. She is biologically depressed, not situationally depressed. She self-medicates with poisonous cigarette after cigarette instead of just seeing a doctor and getting a script. Hopefully, she is taking something at present.

Most movies now contain some sort of mandatory anti-male sentiment and this one does not disappoint. One of Sonnenberg's friends comments that the music business is run by a ""clique of men"" to explain why the violinist, who is far more successful and rich than most of us could ever hope to be, has had so many difficulties. Speaking of men, we are the subject of a hilarious Freudian slip. Sonnenberg announces, at one point, ""You want something really bad and then you can't have him."" Ah, yes, well, at least there are cats. Anyway, in all seriousness, this is a fairly valuable character study and worthy of recommendation.",1143763200,7,2424,5.012406947890819
1427957,4,B00005J75T,"This documentary seems to be more about Nadja the person than about Nadja the artist.  Maybe the two are inseperable, but I was left wondering what a sick cat, alligator hunting, or a hot air balloon ride has to do with playing the violin.  We're deluged with stories of her near self amputation of her left hand pinky, her father's abandonment, her chain smoking, her stalker, her suicide attempt, her mysterious failed ""romance"" (not too hard to read between the lines here), and her tomboy childhood in New York, but left wanting for more information on her musical background.  It seems that this is more about a tormented soul who plays the violin than about a violinist who has personal demons to combat.  A more fitting title might have been Nadja Salerno Sonnenberg - A Study in Manic Depression.

The quality of the video is less than professional.  Much of it looks as though it was shot with a camcorder back in the 80s.  The audio quality isn't much better, and the audio mix is horrible.  I had to turn the volume up to a ridiculous level to hear.  The only extras you get on the DVD are a short bio on NSS, a list of credits, and promos for other videos.  The producers missed a great chance here to offer the viewer a quality performance video with no commentary.

Having said all of that, I still give the documentary 4 stars because of the superb playing that is presented.  Several excerpts of Sonnenberg playing Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Paganini, Shostakovich, Bach, and Mendellsohn are included, both in performance and rehearsal.  There are also plenty of clips of her interacting with chamber music members, which is rare for an artist of her magnitude.  You can't deny her enormous talent, even if her presentation makes you uncomfortable.",1080604800,15,1760,4.746710526315789
1427958,5,B00005J75T,"After catching part of this documentary on HBO, I had to go out and bought it.
Not only is Nadja one (if not the most) talented violinist I have ever heard but the documentary drove me so close to her that you  I felt enchanted by her music. She is an amazing musician and even more extraordinary woman.
The documentary allows you to experience all the pain, stress and glory of being a classical musician. Nadja, you are Breathtaking!",1061856000,7,435,4.506329113924051
1427959,5,B00005J75T,"I watched this movie with a sense of awe I have not felt for any other musician. Not only does Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg have a great sense of humor, she if overflowing with creativity and pure sassiness. Beneath her animated surface there also seems to be a hurricane of emotions which finds its release in her dynamic musical career.

It is as if Nadja becomes the music she is playing or is it just that the music possesses her? She is intense in her original interpretation and hauntingly expressive style. The music does not seem to be coming from the violin, but from deep within Nadja.

You have to ask yourself why anyone so talented and filled with sensitivity would consider ending their life. Especially when you are one of the world's preeminent violinists.

I believe personally that very creative people can also be struggling from a deep depression or unfulfilled longing of the soul. While Nadja sought obvious release through her playing, I think writers find the same expression through words. Both can alternate between utter hopelessness and extreme creativity. At times writing and music almost seem to be ""born of pain.""

What is so powerful about her story is how her mother tells her it takes courage to be happy. How true! It is far easier to give up in light of your circumstances. It takes a deep inner strength and sense of hope to continue in life when you would rather give up. Yet what a talent she has. While her talents were unquestionable at the time, her talent for living still needed to be developed. She had a passion for music, but no passion for life.

Not only do we learn how Nadja's father abandoned her family when she was a very young child, we also learn about her regret of never meeting her father. It seems from what she says in this documentary, work was first in her life and she put health and love second and third. She might be interested to know that smokers have a higher risk of developing depression. In the movie, she seemed to be a chain smoker.

""Cries of the Heart"" by Ravi Zacharias might be helpful for anyone going through what Nadja seems to have experienced. ""Manic Depression and Creativity"" by D. Jablow Hershman discusses Beethoven and other great talents through the ages. The Omega-3 Connection by Andrew L. Stoll would also be worth a read as nutrition is always important.

Where does the love come from when you can't supply it yourself? What makes life worth living when even your own amazing talent isn't satisfying the longings of the soul?

Nadja says she believes in God, but at times he seems really busy. There is definitely a difference between knowing there is a God and having a relationship with him. Or at least a reason for living that goes beyond this temporary existence.

This musician's life shows how material success and fame means little when maybe what we all really want is love and a happy healthy life. Not to mention hope in this life and hope for the life beyond.

I truly hope Nadja has found peace and ways to deal with the sheer explosion of creativity surging from her very soul.

An eccentric, wild and unorthodox story of a musician's passionate existence.

Nadja Salerno Sonnenberg, the subject of this film, is an artist of exceptional talent, but that is not what she or this film is about. This video chronicles the passion, obsession, torment, joy that is the world of this amazing violinist - how she lives for and through her music and how she begins to reconcile herself to the personal, emotional and spiritual cost that comes from her intensely passionate and personal relationship with her gift. Nadja doesn't just play the violin - it is an extension of her thoughts and soul. To hear her play is to be allowed to touch the edges of that experience - to envy her and pity her. Since watching this video I have had the honor to experience Nadja perform live in concert. The experience was more overwhelming then I thought it would be, and I realized how really excellent this film was, as it did capture so much of what makes this artist so exceptional and compelling.

Being a classical music aficionado is irrelevant to this the worth of this video. It is really about being given a small window into the life of a passionate person who seeks their own life's truth.",1300579200,,1183,4.553990610328638

7938462,4,B00005J75T,"Wow, what a documentary.  There are scores of superb violinists in this world, each with their own characteristic ways of moving us.  If you do not choke up immediately when you hear Perlman play the haunting theme music from ""Schindler's List"", then you are hopeless.  If you don't get goose bumps and tingles up your spine when listening to Heifetz tear a scorching fast passage through Max Bruch's Violin Concerto #1, then again you are lost.  If Nigel Kennedy's astoundingly fresh Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" doesn't sound new though you've heard at least 50 other renditions, then you are deaf.  That is the way it is with the best of the best violinists.  They simply transport the listener to some elevated plateau where the senses are cleansed, re-energized, some deeper meaning than was initially apparent in the music is transmitted to the heart and we remember the moments for a very long time.

Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg (NSS)is one such mighty artist.  What is clear in what we learn about her is that she had the musical muse, the need, desire and overwhelming lust to make music at all costs, no matter what, no matter who she left behind, she had to take refuge in the great drug of music.  As a musician and life long lover of many musical forms, I can resonate with that passion.  Some people take life as superficially as they can manage.  That's fine, there is room to swim on the surface and there is a gigantic ocean of limitless depths to explore if the desire is there.  She has that desire.  Iconoclastic musicians often rankle as many people as they entrance and for NSS it is the case.  I am reminded of my great hero, Glenn Gould, who drove purists up the wall with confusion, agony and disgust, especially over his overt and bizarre mannerisms when playing certain music.  To those who grant GG much latitude, the patience is extended to him, we say, come Glenn, show us what is going on in the music, show us insight.  With NSS it would seem, she is not deterred by questionable musical choices.  If the current crowd is not up to Shostakovitch's Violin concerto, too bloody bad.  What they end up getting is their minds blown with music to transform the way the appreciate that form of art. Years later people like NSS are praised for opening doors of musical appreciation, of perception.  Musical leaders are very often far ahead on the curve, eventually making a very valid point of exposition by showing that a particular piece can be invigorated with new perspectives.  Another such brilliant light is the very awesome pianist Martha Argerich, who regularly gives concerts that leave commentators gasping for adjectives and metaphors.

NSS came to her maturity as an artist with a great cost.  After nearly chopping off the tip of her finger (I did that once many years ago and it healed as well), after having to protect herself from a stalker (the great fear of the rich and famous) and then finding the dark dog of depression come to dwell in her exhausted and lonely state....she nearly ended her life.  With that failure behind her, with a sensational comeback performance rocking the audience,  ever firmer on her feet, she has gone from strength to strength.

A wonderful story to watch.  It is so inspiring to see a human being make such great use of such a wondrous gift.  What remains are her words: the only thing that ever brought her true happiness was sharing her music with all.",1266796800,2,3424,4.710924369747899
