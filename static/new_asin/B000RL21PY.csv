8201228,5,B000RL21PY,I constantly struggle trying to find movies that entertain me. This movie was exactly what I was looking for. We are nearing a digital cloning war where we can no longer trust our eyes. This movie is a must see!,1405382400,2,211,4.3
8201229,2,B000RL21PY,"After a good beginning, Confess drifts into a less interesting theme.  After about an hour I was tempted to stop watching.  I didn't buy Ali Larter's character at all.  She's writing a thesis but she turns into an activist (accused of being a cyber-terrorist).  Why?  Her motivation for taking an active role instead of a research role was never clear to me.  The story of Eugene Byrd's character is strong and the movie would have been better if the Ali Larter character hadn't sidetracked it.  There was probably a point this movie was trying to make, a message it wanted to deliver, but I couldn't find it.  The end of the movie is ridiculously unrealistic.",1333324800,,660,4.678260869565217
