8656076,1,B00K5SIST2,This movie was bad but not in a Mystery Science Theatre way either.  It was just really not good.  It was almost as if they just got their friends together to do and impromptu reenactment of Mean Girls and Step Up.  I have seen better acting the Snuggie infomercial. The dancing could be considered decent if you are really into high school talent shows or teen recitals. I can't figure out why this movie was made other than for a tax write off. Maybe the actors will be famous some day but for now I would recommend watching Paul Walker and Denise Richards in Tammy and the T-Rex instead.,1436400000,,590,4.394495412844036
