8344425,5,B001ULDJYC,"I have taught grades 11 & 12 Chemistry for 16 years.  This DVD series is a very good tool to use in your classes.  Topics are explained in a clear and simple fashion, notes are provided on-screen along with practice problems that the students can solve and then see solved.  Examples of experiments are shown as well.  There are no real flashy animations or ""eye-catching"" effects, but the information is very good.  It's an series from USA, but they use the SI system in the videos, and explain it very well.",1299974400,11,509,4.549450549450549
8344426,5,B001ULDJYC,"I am a high school chemistry teacher, and in my opinion...

The Georgia Public Broadcasting Chemistry series is hands-down one of the best educational series I've ever seen. My understanding is that the entire state of Georgia uses these videos for chemistry education, but I don't know that for sure. Either way, these videos are superb for students (high school or college) who are struggling with chemistry, who are being home-schooled, who missed a day or week of class. Each video includes interactive notes, and each unit has a review worksheet. The videos are well-organized, use easy-to-understand language/examples/models, and are very thorough (on a basic level). I only remember seeing one VERY minor mistake in the entire series. Every parent who home schools a high school student and every high school chemistry department (or library) should own this series. It covers every basic chemistry concept, and for an extremely low cost. I think the entire series is around $270 (~30 lessons at ~25 minutes each). Most other educational videos will set you back fifty bucks or more for ONE 15-minute video...and they typically aren't very good at all. The teacher in this series is definitely on the corny side, but you get used to it. Who expected a normal science teacher anyway? I really can't praise this series enough.
