7351980,5,B012HTAGBY,"Excellent movie....I was sceptical after reading one of the reviews but I'm glad I took a chance - WOW....I think this is one of the better films on the subject.  The actors, especially the Cardinal - superb!  Very believable and Angela was played flawlessly - from the raised eyebrow to the evil that grew through each scene.  Perfection!  Don't miss this one if you fancy this subject.  KUDOS All!",1445299200,,399,4.72463768115942
7351981,5,B012HTAGBY,"This movie was amazing!  Unbelievable it's the only way to explain how I've never heard of this before and it was so good!  There are actors in this that most people will recognize and boy are they acting well.  The storyline is wonderful and believable the directing and producing are almost seamless.  In a year where movies in this genre are usually not so well done anymore, I am thrilled at this movies qualities.  And I keep trying to say it's not as good as the Exorcist was in the 70s but it comes pretty close!!",1445299200,,520,4.375
7351982,5,B012HTAGBY,"I have been waiting for this movie to be available on Amazon since the move first came out into theaters.  For years, The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose were the measuring sticks.  This movie sets a new bar for others to try to match and surpass in the future.  With Vatican Tapes, that's going go be a really tough act to follow.
  Without the sensationalism that's typically the main focus of movies in this genre, while keeping me on the edge of my seat, Vatican Tapes treats the battle between good and evil more carefully and to me, more realistically than anything I've in seen the past.  It shows the patience, ease and guile that evil can use to take over a soul.  So while there were really good scary scenes with cool Fx, those scenes contributed to the story rather than being used as the bulk and focus of the movie.
  The Vatican Tapes made everything so real and current, that alone draws the viewer right in. Acting, script, direction, cinematography, special Fx, all top notch.  I'd write more, but I'm going to watch it again while I still have time. I was so wrapped up in the movie, I can't remember the music and sound Fx!
  Really well done!",1445299200,3,1171,4.446009389671362
7351983,3,B012HTAGBY,"Why does the devil choose one person over another? Theres no explanation. The devil can choose anyone. Angie Holmes (Dudley) is like any other 20-something. She wants a good job and a good life. After anyone she is close to becomes injured or worse she wonders what is wrong with her. When she is determined to be possessed a simple exorcism seems to be the answer. When the Vatican sends down Father Lozano (Pea) to help he discovers something more terrifying than anyone could have imagined. I first of all have to say how nice it was to see a horror movie that wasn't all filmed with a hand held camera. This movie used the type of idea that the Fourth Kind did, where it was part fake documentary and part actual movie. As far as the actual movie goes it wasn't that bad at all, but it was really just generic and nothing all that new to the exorcism genre. The acting is good and the movie is watchable but it doesnt do anything amazing to set itself apart from every other movie in this genre. Overall, not bad and I did like it, but at the same time nothing special or something to run out and watch. I give it a B-.",1444867200,22,1123,4.252336448598131

7351986,1,B012HTAGBY,So off the mark I didn't even get to the end. If you are going to perform an exorcism you might want to actually use the Rite of Exorcism and the Prayer to Saint Michael.,1510272000,,170,3.8857142857142857
7351987,1,B012HTAGBY,"Movie about a possessed woman and the sickness that is consuming her.
What made this film terrible was not so much the acting, as the actors/actress were rather good. It was more the script, screenplay, and the portrayal of dozen of movies before it -here- done worse.",1510272000,,268,4.723404255319149
7351988,1,B012HTAGBY,"Without a doubt the least scary, most predictable, overproduced piece of stereotypical cinematic garbage I have ever watched. Why can't people realize that if you choreograph everything that is supposed to be frightening (<- a term used in a purely hypothetical sense in this movie's case) with suspense-killing audio, the most overused CGI-enhanced cookie cutter VFX, uninspired storyline and overused genre references, then couple this with a shallow, non-existant path of logic or any semblance character development or motivation, that your movie is going to suck balls?? It can't be THAT hard to figure this out!

None of the supposedly Christian or even Catholic stuff in this movie is accurate in any way. Unfortunately the blatant mistakes and misrepresentations distract from just trying to tell a spooky story. I wish that these writers would actually read and/or do some research on what they're talking about before they write travesties like this.

It also keeps plot points planted in what you would think that reality would be. I enjoyed it, especially the ending -- it does wrap up the movie, but lets you begin to ask, ""Well... what now?""",1481328000,,332,4.203125
7352086,2,B012HTAGBY,"This movie had a really shallow storyline, a very slow start, and not much of an ending.  Sometimes horror films follow a pattern of building a complex story to a climatic end where all the action happens in the last 25% of the movie.  While that was the case here, the action wasn't dependent on most of the backstory.  Additionally the backstory was mostly one cliche after another.",1481328000,,384,4.617647058823529

I've seen him in other movies recently, and hoped he'd get better parts so he could ""stretch his wings"", so to speak. He played a member of the tank crew in the Brad Pitt movie ""Fury"", and I think he did a good job there. His part in the alien invasion movie set in Los Angeles was too short, but he did the best he could with it.

The problem I had with The Vatican Tapes is that, the behavior of the priests in this movie was a bit rogue, they didn't follow true exorcist rituals. I know, it's just a movie! Without giving a spoiler, I can only say that I think the script writers could have improved the plot by following true exorcist rituals--it would have enhanced the typical struggle between good and evil, and made the ending a bit more shocking. Instead, the plot ended up being a bit predictable.

Overall, it was okay, just not a box-office smash.",1472688000,,940,4.245810055865922

And we know how these things end. The anti-Christ either dies or it don't.

Yes, we can all say ""been there done that"" and was done better. I particular liked how they did the first hour of the film and Olivia Taylor Dudley did a convincing job.

It's my break from physical and emotional work of trying to save animals. Some times a good movie can set the tone of the day for me. Heartwarming movies to start with give me a sense of peace to start my day. I watch different genres depending on the time of day. Scary movies late night, inspirational and heartwarming to start my day and early evening I like action and adventure, 007 type spy etc. That's just me. So here, I have to start by saying that I always have loved Dugray Scott as an actor, so I figured this would be a half way decent movie. This was not as great as The Exorcist but it was so much better than many other movies portraying Good against Evil. To me, it was inspirational in that it made me feel like I have been strongly on the right path in my life rejecting evil no matter what happens to me. It is just a movie but I like the reinforcement, regardless that I am not as religious as I once was, to never let the bad things that have happened to me change the kind heart in my soul. It does this with me by reminding me that we never know what existance is all about, really! I was raised going to church every Sunday and going to catechism, then I became a biologist. My education trained me in the facts of how physical life works but somethings are still so mysterious I have to also still believe in something spiritual.

Synopsis : A young woman finds herself the target of demonic possession, not just any demon but Satan himself.
As she slowly starts to exhibit more and more strange behavior that her father and boyfriend, not to mention the mental hospitals she finds herself in due to their lack in the belief that there is a hell and that people can become possessed come to believe after meeting a young priest who volunteers at the mental institution the young woman is staying in after he explains what is happening.
Unlike other movies dealing with the devil the Catholic church is shown in a more positive light in showing how it helps families deal with a loved one who becomes possessed by evil entities.

7352502,5,B012HTAGBY,"Perhaps not as good as the original Exorcist (1973), but very reminiscent of it.

She slowly turns on the others surrounding her, and from the psychiatric institute gets send away home where her boyfriend, father, and a local priest await the arrival of a high ranking priest from Vatican City, whose specialty is exorcism. What follows after will leave you with goosebumps...and the best part of this film is the ending, which I found to be the best part of the entire film.  I hope to see a continuum in a form of part two sometime in 2016.

The scene with the cop and the light-bulbs in the hospital, together with the asylum scene where the possessed is talking to a wall are one of the best ones.  The highlight of the film of course is the last 15 minutes...I enjoy watching open-ended final scenes left to viewer's own interpretations.",1450828800,,962,4.635294117647059

7352504,4,B012HTAGBY,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

On the surface, THE VATICAN TAPES looks like every other exorcism movie on the market.  It has a girl who may or may not be possessed, Catholic priests, and a bunch of jump-scare moments that sometimes play out into real horror.  But in addition to these, the film also offers something that many of these other films do not:  entertainment.  Granted, THE VATICAN TAPES does not bring anything new to the table, but its still a fun film regardless and worthy of checking out.

I was ready to like this film from the start, primarily because Dougray Scott and Djimon Hounsou are in the cast.  I like both actors, therefore I was hoping the film would be good.  Thankfully, I was not disappointed.

THE VATICAN TAPES is shot well and looks good onscreen.  I was expecting this to be a found-footage or documentary style film, but turns out its shot like an actual movie.  This was a nice surprise, as I think too many exorcism films are leaning that way.

The acting is very good, with the afore mentioned stars headlining a great cast.  Olivia Taylor Dudley does a great job as Angela, and Michael Pena rounds out the cast as Father Lozano.

The story and how it plays out is what really got me with THE VATICAN TAPES.  Director Mark Neveldine keeps the audience guessing until the end, and when things really start happening, they take off with a bang.  I like how the possession turns out, although I won't give away any spoilers.

My primary complaint about the film is that it is full of overused possession concepts and again offers nothing new in regard to exorcism films.  The ending is a bit unique, however everything prior is the same stuff weve seen in scads of horror flicks.

Still, THE VATICAN TAPES is fun and worth giving a look.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1450310400,,1869,4.522388059701493

My oldest daughter told me this was terrifying, so when she came home for Thanksgiving, we watched it pretty late at night (there's something about watching a horror movie during the day that just isn't cool), and I was hoping for the kind of film that left me wanting to leave the lights on all night, Bible tucked under my pillow, and actually saying a prayer or two before bed. Not so much. It had some creepier elements - the upside down eyeballs (sort of in a similar vein to the backwards crab walk in the director's cut of The Exorcist) and a few other little things here and there that were slightly chilling, but overall, it didn't leave me frightened or needing to leave the lights on all night.

Of course it shouldn't be a case study in the phenomenon of exoricsm and demon possession, but as a piece of horror, it is quite good.  People should stop comparing this to other exorcism movies especially the classic The Exorcist.  That movie was an event that could never be duplicated again.  I highly recommend this movie to horror fans especially if you are a fan of this genre of horror.  Many Catholic symbolism in this movie, so if you are not particularly interested in that, you should stay clear of it.  I've seen many movies about exorcism, and this does have a different take on the genre, which fans will appreciate.  Good movie to watch for Halloween.",1446163200,5,834,4.581081081081081
7352536,2,B012HTAGBY,"Well,what can I say. The Vatican Tapes is an exorcist film that tries to be different. Completely,different. Different in the sense that the devil wins in the end as it was the ultimate demon itself - the Anti- Christ.

This supernatural horror film stars Olivia Taylor Dudley as the 27- year old Angela Holmes,a woman who as living a normal life until she got possessed by a devil. Dougray Scott,Kathleen Robertson,Michael Pea,Djimon Hounsou and John Patrick Amedori make up the supporting cast.

What started as a wound which Angela had after trying to cut a piece of her birthday cake for her father resulted to her having strange and erratic behaviors. When the doctors gave up on her recovery,the hospital where she was admitted called in the people from the Vatican to remove the demon that is upon her. In the end,the Vatican priest - Cardinal Bruun - just proved to be too much for the devil inside her as it turned out to be the Anti-Christ or the ultimate Satanic force that needed possibly Jesus himself to conquer in the end.

The movie tried to go to another direction to become different from the typical exorcist film when it had the Anti-Christ instead of the so-called ordinary devil or demon that possessed the main protagonist. No question that it consists of all the elements and themes required for its film genre. But the ending just resulted silly in the end. The presence of the Anti-Christ in the demon possession would probably make any Christian or Catholic laugh or feel insulted in the end. Its attempt to move to become different made it disastrous overall.",1446076800,2,1587,4.763636363636364

7352539,3,B012HTAGBY,"THE VATICAN TAPES was only mediocre to me. I'd rather have given it 2 1/2 starts instead of 3, but that's not possible. Personally, I thought this wasted some very accomplished actors (namely, Michael Pena) with a substandard script and direction. I am a big fan of the Demonic Possession Genre (if there's such a thing) and I've seen a million of them, it seems. Aside from the huge Hollywood Blockbusters like ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Omen"", there really haven't been that many that have been very good from start to finish.
With that said, I saw a movie I'd never heard of that went straight to video and I saw it here, on Amazon. So, now when I see something like this film with a bigger budget and probably more production costs, it makes me stop to wonder about these over-priced and over hyped movie trailers we all have seen. The other movie I am referring to is called ATTICUS INSTITUTE and I found it to me one of THE scariest films on demonic possession I have ever seen. The concept was very creative and brilliant in it's simplicity. Without pounding the viewer with special effects like puking green pea soup or twisting heads or even the birth of the Antichrist, this movie scared me to death. I believe it is because when less is given to an audience, the viewer himself, when left to our own imaginations can come up with more scares than anything that was shown in the film. All you need is great writing, good and believable actors and then, sit back and see if what you imagine might by far more disturbing than what was shown in the film.
Now, when I see more demonic possession movies, I find myself comparing it to the ATTICUS INSTITUTE and so far, they've all fallen short of that little known film!",1445990400,10,1721,4.484076433121019

7352542,3,B012HTAGBY,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Discussions on exorcism were something that most people were never aware of, more often than not something loosely tossed into a story of some horror film. And then in 1973 that all changed when William Peter Blattys novel THE EXORCIST was brought to the screen. Suddenly we had numerous movies concerning exorcisms being done around the world. But none of them ever captured that sheer terror we found in the original. With THE VATICAN TAPES that record remains.

Angela Holmes (Olivia Taylor Dudley) is a young woman about to be married. Her father Roger (Dougray Scott) is a military man who comes home to visit on her birthday. An injury at her party leads to a trip to the doctor where she begins to act strange. Conveniently a Father Lozano (Michael Pena) is on hand to witness some of the thing that happen. As the days go by and he sees more of Angela, he becomes convinced she is possessed. Security footage is smuggled to the Vatican, who apparently have an archive of such footage from around the world, and the eventual decision that only an exorcism can save this girl comes to be.

The pacing of the movie is slow enough that while it should be developing suspense it actually bogs down whats going on. I mean face it, we know from the title that an exorcism is eventually going to happen. And weve seen enough of these movies to know that the priests involved will have something in their history that makes their involvement either a hindrance on what they are doing or leads to their demise. But this movie takes its time getting us to that point where the exorcism takes place.

It isn't until the final third of the film that things begin to move in this direction. The background stories aren't presented well enough to make them memorable. I watched this movie less than a week ago and honestly cant recall much about them. But the exorcism happens and things make noise, furniture bounces and backs bend in unnatural ways on the possessed human. Been there, done that. They do add a twist here at the end that changes things up a bit but by then most of us will have lost interest. I know I did.

I won't say I hated this movie but come on, lets do something new here. Lets make it different than the hundreds of movies in the genre that have come before. Yes the production quality and the acting were better than low budget movies done on the same topic but there are no scares here and nothing to make anyone find their faith again. Even THE LAST EXORCISM brought something fresh to the table.

If clichd items are fine with you then you might enjoy this. If you're a fan of every exorcism movie ever made then have at it. For me I cant recommend this one to anyone. All it made me do was feel sorry for Dougray Scott who made the wrong career move when he decided to not take on the role of Wolverine in the first X-Men movie. Then again perhaps Hugh Jackmans good fortune was better for us all.",1445904000,7,2977,4.443223443223443

7352544,1,B012HTAGBY,"Nothing at all frightened me about this ""repeat"" of the best of the exorcism movies from way back. Well, I will say it was somewhat different in character studies than most, but the idea was the same nonsense. Giving the reader a synopsis isn't worth it. Suffice it to say don't invest your money in this turkey.",1445731200,,312,4.491228070175438
7352545,2,B012HTAGBY,This movie was NOT worth the rental fee of $4.00.  It wasn't a bad movie but there just wasn't much to it.  I got about as much out of the trailer as I did the movie.  I would suggest you wait until you can get it at Redbox for $1.50.,1445731200,2,234,3.64

The Vatican Tapes did not disappoint.  It's not perfect, but definitely a solid four stars for me.  If you're a fan of the genre, as I am, it's worth a watch.",1445558400,,394,4.226666666666667
7352550,1,B012HTAGBY,"Oh my God this movie was just awful. I love horror movies, even bad ones, but this one was so boring and predictable it's a joke. What little special FX were used must have cost a total of $25. And poor Micheal Pena, a good actor surrounded by people you've never heard of and hope to never hear of again. The positive reviews on here must be fake because there is no way this lame 90 minutes could have held anyone in suspense. Don't waste your time and money on this horrendous piece of crap.",1445558400,3,494,4.2105263157894735
