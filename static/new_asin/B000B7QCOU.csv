2404915,4,B000B7QCOU,"Initially, I hated Dr. Pamela Peekes ""Body for Life for Women"" book. Telling me I had a ""menopot"", raging hormones, chocolate cravings etc. Geez by the time I was finished the book I felt like a total mess. I was thinking about returning the book to the store in disgust..but when I reflected on the book's contents I had to admit EVERY WORD SHE SAID WAS TRUE!

So I decided to incorporate some of her ideas into a simple health plan. (I often use her strength training plan for upper body, some of her nutrition ideas, count calories ala ""The Calories Queens"" book and mix up my cardio often including using my favorite Dance Revolution game) I picked up her DVD for more ideas. The ""Body for Life"" DVD is a nice compliment to her book, however, it isn't a replacement..more of an overview.

The DVD begins with an introduction by Dr. Peeke. Dr. Peeke is a rangy blond who embodies the vibrant, fitness she preaches. I saw her speak several years ago on her ""Fight Fat Over Forty"" book and she is just as slender and energetic now as she was then. In the introduction, Dr. Peeke encourages you to take charge of your health and she does something many women would like to do...she smashes a scale and tells you, that you can use other ways to ""measure"" your size. (In the book she recommends the Tanita line of scales and I agree - see my review on the Tanita BC533..so smashing your scales is not a necessity..but for anyone whose emotions are determined by the number on the scale it may be a good idea!)

Next the workout is introduced. In her book, Dr. Peeke recommends alternating days of weight workouts with cardio workouts so I was surprised and disappointed that the workout in her DVD does not follow this principle. Instead she shares three 10 minute workouts. The cardio is not long enough to meet the 30 minute recommendation she makes in her book and the upper and lower body workouts are also very short at only 10 minutes each. That is not to say these are not nice quickie workouts..but they don't follow the method she recommends in ""Body for Life for Women"". It would have been really nice if she had followed the method described in her book and demonstrated proper technique for the strength training exercises using a weight bench and including a full upper and lower body workout and a separate 30 minute cardio session.

The 10 minute cardio session includes basic moves like side by side step, reach and pulls, jump squats etc. The upper body workout includes basic moves that call for one to five pound weights and the lower body workout uses a mat and chair. There are two exercisers and one demonstrates modified positions.

The next section discusses hormonal milestones. Dr. Peeke discusses what happens to a woman's body during the teens and twenties, thirties, fourties, fifties and beyond. This is covered in much greater depth in her book. I should note that though the DVD is of a nice quality, at times Dr. Peeke is looking at a different camera and thus not at us, her audience. This is a bit awkward at times but overall does not effect her message.

One interesting aspect to the DVD is the 12 Week Challenge section. In this section you click on one week at a time for tips that cover MIND, MOUTH and MUSCLE. The first week for example implores you to Embrace Adversity for Mind, Dejunk your kitchen for Mouth, and Take the First Step for Muscle. This is a really nice feature. Because you can hear some bite sized advice each week and incorporate it into your life. The next week you can click on a new week for fresh ideas.

A bonus section is also included in the DVD. Called Smart Food Choices. In this section Dr. Peeke has an array of food and she makes suggestions as to the types of foods you should eat ie: lean proteins, unprocessed food, water rich vegetables etc. She covers quality, quantity and frequency. This is done very quickly and she doesn't cover portion sizes in detail.

The DVD does not include a lot of discussion on weight loss, it is really just a simple overview of the book, a chance to see Dr. Peeke and get some fresh ideas. It is not a replacement to the book..just a supplement. It would have been much better if it had included the workout plan as demonstrated in her book.

2404916,4,B000B7QCOU,"The video is good.  However, I was surprised that the DVD did not relate too closely to the book (Body for life for women)by Dr. Peeke.  Still the workouts were good.",1253145600,2,166,4.32258064516129
2404917,1,B000B7QCOU,I'm not sure what I bought this for but to think it was more specific for women. For the Body for Life program I see no value in this purchase.,1241913600,2,143,3.8
2404918,1,B000B7QCOU,"I haven't read Dr. Peeke's book, but I have read and followed Bill Phillips Body For Life.  I bought the DVD to supplement routines at home on days I could not get to the gym.  So that I could have video to follow and motivation at home to exercise for ""Body For Life""  The exercises on this DVD are not even comparable to the exercise routine in the original Body For Life book or plan.  There are 3 ten-minute workouts. 10 minutes for upper body, 10 minutes for lower body and abs, and a 10-minute cardio routine.  That's it.  If you are serious about transformation, I would recommend sticking with the original.  Very disappointed with Dr. Peeke's version of Body For Life.  Not sure how it could even legal to insinuate a resemblance to the original.  But that's just my opinion.",1237334400,4,784,4.50354609929078
2404919,5,B000B7QCOU,"Great video.  Speaks to the mind and body about how women can improve their day to day health by exercise, proper nutrition and positive thoughts.  Dr. Peake is great.",1234224000,,167,4.724137931034483
2404920,4,B000B7QCOU,"I love Ellen Barrett & Dr. Peeke.  The information contained here is excellent.  It is especially good if you are a beginner.  We can all take something positive away from the message - it's a mind, body spirit thing to lose weight and to stay healthy.",1231891200,2,252,4.434782608695652
2404921,5,B000B7QCOU,"I love this book.  I have been doing the program for 4 weeks, and have lost at last weigh in 9 lbs.  I love the program and it really can work for you.  Try it and see!!!  You will feel great.",1212451200,,192,3.6097560975609757
2404922,1,B000B7QCOU,"If an exercise DVD motivates me to get up and actually do the work, and if I am happy to return to it repeatedly, I consider it a DVD worth having. There are many excellent exercise DVDs that do, however Pamela Peeke's is not one of them.  Since it is well known that the use of exciting, upbeat music helps motivate and inspire people to exercise, I cannot understand why anyone would produce an exercise DVD without including this easy and enjoyable benefit. Instead, the Peeke DVD offers only exceptionally dull, tedious, and repetitive music which not only fails to get the viewer charged up, but causes me to want to avoid listening to it altogether. The offensive music is further emphasized by demonstrators who unfortunately lack a sense of rhythm. I find watching them exercise while just slightly off the beat to be annoying, distracting,  and thoroughly off-putting.  As a result, while this DVD is collecting dust, I return to those which combine exciting, fun, and motivating music with demonstrators who are capable of moving to the beat, and make me want to get up and exercise with them.",1201737600,25,1103,4.794736842105263
2404923,4,B000B7QCOU,This book didn't really tell me any more that any other exercise and health book.  It is nice that it came with a workout cd too.  I watched the workout but have not done it.  It did not seem like anything special at all.  There are certainly much better exercise cds out there.,1189987200,,278,4.188679245283019
2404924,5,B000B7QCOU,"I am 50 and have always been thin.  Lately, I have a bit of a pooch and cannot seem to lose the 15 extra pounds of weight I have put on the last few years.  This DVD and book are a GREAT starting point for people who have resisted exercise.  Well worth the money.  The 10 minute segments are great if you are short on time, can be done twice, or all together. You decide what works for you!  Buy this set.",1144195200,24,405,3.8902439024390243
2404925,5,B000B7QCOU,"This dvd is so much more than a workout dvd.  It's really like a 50 minute health and fitness 'seminar' and then a workout.  Pamela Peeke who wrote the book, leads the informational portion and she is terrific in helping you understand everything she talks about because she talks in a friendly and easy to follow way (laymans terms).  You'll learn about exercise, nutrition, hormones stress relief.  For the workout segment, Ellen Barrett leads it and that section is both fun and effective.  There is the usuall marches, hops and step touches (but you can modify it all to make it either easier or harder).  After the cardio there is a body sculpting section with Pilates moves.  It's not the absolute most challenging workout I've ever done, but it still gets the heart rate up and still will help you tone up.  All together with the workout and the information, I think this is one of the better fitness dvd's out there.",1138060800,34,924,4.660493827160494

8082889,4,B000B7QCOU,"The first time I did this video, I didn't think it was a workout at all. I've been a dancer all my life, and at the time, I was still dancing two or three times per week.

However, I had to stop dancing for awhile, and when I picked this video up again, I could feel the burn. It's a nice, lower intensity workout that can kickstart you back on the road to health. I'd definitely recommend it for someone just starting.

I really don't like the music, because it's not well-matched to the moves. It's close, but sometimes that timing just gets off, and it really bugs me.",1388102400,3,571,4.229357798165138

8082891,1,B000B7QCOU,"This workout is like a basic warm-up and cool-down. The moves are boring, simple, and repetitive. It seems focused on an audience that has never exercised at all. Dr. Peeke is shown in her workout clothes on the cover of the DVD but in her business suit talking in the DVD presentation. Curious why she doesn't lead the workout instead of the personal trainer. And, the music was all wrong. Too loud, overpowering the trainer's voice. During the official cool-down the beat was too fast and didn't match the activity at all. Incongruent throughout. I thought the book was inspiring and very informative but this DVD is not worth the time or money.",1358985600,5,647,4.734513274336283
8082892,4,B000B7QCOU,"I like the exercise portion of this video because it has 3 sections, cardio, upper body and lower body exercises each consisting of 10 minute workouts.  You can set the video to run all 3 workouts continuously for a full 30 minute workout or you can break it down into a 10 or 20 minute workout. Some days I find it hard to fit a full workout into my day but I can ALWAYS seem find 10 minutes...this video fits the bill!  I love it! :)",1353283200,3,435,4.046511627906977
8082893,5,B000B7QCOU,"I have not read Dr. Peeke's book on this system. I'm sure it's great. As for the workout on this DVD it is a program designed for women who are beginning a routine and whose bodies are just warming up to the idea of working out. I used to workout hard, but saw that, especiclly in this very cold winter, my body is always tired and needed a lower impact workout, this was it. I think it is reasonable to start a beginner off slowly and progress after some time. This video does just that. The cardio is a life saver with variations of low and high impact (when I feel tired and my pressure is very low I do this workout/warm up and I have and instant boost). The lower and upper body workouts are truly amazing if you are starting to take that step into fitness and the information Dr. Peeke gives you about how your body works is a very helpful starting point. I only wish I had this all that time ago, so that I knew what I was looking for in my workout and how to do it right. As a platform for working out and eating the correct way, this is it (although you may want to do a little more research on food habit and eating and portion control) Everyone is different. Throw away that scale (okay, just put it to the side and take it out once a month), get a measuring tape, a good pair of sneakers, and a diary. And this video. These are all you need to get started. You will win!",1265673600,7,1382,4.065934065934066
