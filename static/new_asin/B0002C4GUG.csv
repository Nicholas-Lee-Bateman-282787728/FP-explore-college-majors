2075773,5,B0002C4GUG,"I LOVE this movie!  I make it a point to watch it every Christmas - and you will see why as the movie climaxes during the Christmas season!  It is a beautiful tear-jerker...and very inspiring as we realize the hand of God is on our lives...yes, He does take care of us even when we don't believe that He does during our ""winter"" season.  A must-have movie!",1198195200,3,356,4.2835820895522385
2075774,4,B0002C4GUG,"This is a good family movie. It is similar to the ""Love Comes Softly"" series.",1184371200,,77,4.2
2075775,5,B0002C4GUG,"Martha Richards was in winter. Her heart was cold and unable to let go of the pain and resentment that filled it like a December blizzard. It had not always been so. When she and her husband Jed loaded their wagon, her heart was in the sunshine of summer. With their two beautiful daughters they headed west in hope of a better life. Her precious daughters died on the journey, and her heart was lost in a winter of pain. When orphaned Danny enters her life, she is unwilling to love him. Winter's grip on her heart makes her unable to love either him, her own husband, or her savior. Will the blush of spring ever touch her aching heart again? Find out by watching this beautiful touching story. While the movie is a low budget film with low production values, the story in it easily outweighs these factors.",1133740800,17,809,4.436241610738255
2075776,5,B0002C4GUG,"This movie was utterly stunning. We had read the story for Christmas every year, and when we found out there was a movie for it, we were amazed. Sam Hennings did a tremendous job as the father, and the mother also-OF COURSE so did the little boy!!

I couldn't help from crying over and over because the movie was so touching and plays with your emotions greatly.

It starts out as when a mother and father, now parentless because of the death of their two daughters, are given a boy to take care of around the age of seven or eight. The father begins to love the boy, but how can the mother when her two beautiful daughters are dead? Always turning cold towards the boy, the mother doesn't know how to love him....but then again...hearts can be mended in Seasons of the Heart.",1124496000,21,776,4.381944444444445

2075792,5,B0002C4GUG,"Seasons Of The Heart is a rare family film that works. Not sticky sweet, it is the tale of a family who's daughters die in an epidemic. They get a new chance at a family , when they take in an orphan boy. Realistic touches like the father bonding quickly, the mother not as fast. Recommend this tearjerker wholeheartedly. You will weep ! A film you can watch with anybody. Yvonne De Carlo narrates the film, as the voice of the mother in older age, and it's a nice touch.",1435622400,,471,4.2444444444444445

2075795,5,B0002C4GUG,"Excellent movie.  Don't expect to love the heroine (even after her turnaround, I still found myself labeling her as a self-centered and spoiled little woman--OK, I'm biased when it comes to kids!), but the movie is sweet and teaches some valuable lessons.  Clean for the whole family to enjoy together.",1427414400,,302,5.02

2075797,5,B0002C4GUG,This is a beautiful movie that deals with grieving loss. The story is very well done and the acting is good. I watched it as a child and enjoyed it but it is a tear-jerker and now that I am adult I appreciate the lessons about loss and the seasons that our hearts can go through even more....,1425254400,,292,4.051724137931035

2075800,5,B0002C4GUG,Very touching and sad. I love this story and highly recommend it. There is sorrow and loss but the story of Jesus Christ' birth was the common ground and revelation of love that opened the eyes and heart of a broken mother.,1419638400,,223,4.333333333333333

2075809,5,B0002C4GUG,A classic. Must see. A tender hearted movie but mot sappy with perfect amount of good values promoted. Not overdone but a movie that brings out values that are timeless.,1378425600,,169,4.666666666666667

2075811,5,B0002C4GUG,"The story, which takes place between a pioneer couple who live in a cabin on the prairie, is narrated by the voice of an older woman as she looks back on a season during early marriage when her heart was very hard.  She was embittered because of the sudden death of two precious young daughters.  A pastor-neighbor foists an orphan boy on her and her husband but she cannot love this boy.  She doesn't want him and she resents him for everything he does.

The movie is very much the story of the boy, as much as it is the story of an important test in the lives of the husband and wife.  I felt that the actor who played the character of this young man was exceptional, if for no other reason than that I found him very likable and lovable--which is, of course, what the movie makers wanted the viewer to feel.

A great family movie for any season of the heart or of the year.  Because of the ending scene which is a turning point of realization when a Love in Christ is born, it would be an especially appropriate film for the Christmas season.

I LOVED the movie, felt that the woman's narrative voice was especially well done, and I am still especially touched with love whenever I recall this young orphan boy of the story.  I don't know if it was the actor's skill or just the person himself, but the boy had such a sweet heart.

This is an especially good family film.  I think there is no reason that anyone should not see it!  Highly recommend it.",1366848000,,1455,4.2700729927007295

2075814,4,B0002C4GUG,"Great family movie.
My husband and I  truly enjoyed it,  The acting was first class.  The story teaches true family values, and the qualities in life that are important.  After watching it I felt it was a good movie for my yound grandson to see.",1363651200,2,245,4.377777777777778
2075815,4,B0002C4GUG,This is one of our Christmas movies we watch every year. It just wouldn't seem like Christmas without it. It reminds us of days gone by and how amidst hard times there can be a good life changing lesson.,1358294400,,203,4.230769230769231

2075817,5,B0002C4GUG,This movie will tug at your heart.  A young mother has lost her 2 sweet daughters on the way west and she is faced with raising an orphaned boy who is a typical little boy.  He likes to get dirty when he plays and he is curious about everything and gets into mischief.  But one never knows what will cause their heart to accept differences and open up and love again.  A good movie to watch with the family.,1355270400,3,407,4.113924050632911
2075818,5,B0002C4GUG,"The storyline is excellent.  Watching this movie is one of our Christmas traditions.  Movie not sappy but deals with hard issues like the loss of two little girls.  Mom was broken and mad at God for that turn of events. She then has to deal with a messy, male red-headed orphan who completely gets on her nerves, who recently lost his family.  Surprising ending.  I love it!  Would highly recommend.",1336435200,3,399,4.628571428571429

2075823,5,B0002C4GUG,When we wore out our vhs version of this we had to replace with the dvd.  This is a family favorite for us.  The message of healing and hope is so clear. We watch it every Christmas season.,1256083200,,189,3.9473684210526314
2075824,5,B0002C4GUG,"What i love about this movie is where it took place i enjoy watching how the pioneers had to survive the roughness of the deserted wilderness especially this particular couple. The pain that this husband and wife  had to go through without their two daughters. The wife bitter with grief made it impossible for her to feel love for anyone again or happy for that matter. But of course there is a test of the heart she must face to love another child again even if it is not her own but an orphaned boy. I just love how it all worked out in God's perfect timing she had a patient loving, understanding husband to help her find her self again. This is truly a family movie even my grandkids like this movie.",1250985600,2,705,4.3007518796992485

2075826,5,B0002C4GUG,This is an excellent family film that is very touching.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is a story of a mother dealing with the death of her daughters while traveling on a wagon train. She could not even think of having anyone replace her daughters much less having a young orphan boy brought into her home. One will find the film filled with funny moments as well as moments that melt the heart.  I have to say this one of my favorite movies.,1234310400,3,447,4.247058823529412
8025787,3,B0002C4GUG,"The video and audio quality leave something to be desired, but I love this movie and wanted to own it in DVD so I'll  take what I can get. At least it played without any issues, so it's watchable.",1521504000,,196,4.0256410256410255

8025791,3,B0002C4GUG,"First of all, the other reviews here aren't of this movie, but apparently some other movie with the same title. This TV movie stars Carol Burnett and George Segal. The story revolves around Carol and her drug addict daughter who abandons her son who is then taken in by grandmother Carol. There's a back story here about previous marriages and romances that we are never given a clear picture of. The story isn't very original and the acting is just OK. It's not however a Christmas movie as other reviews would indicate.",1512518400,,521,4.673913043478261
