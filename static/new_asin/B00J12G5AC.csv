Having said that, this movie is not available through TCM where even their DVD-R, made on demand movies are of excellent viewing quality, so it is worth having until then.",1408060800,,322,4.872727272727273

This movie is effed up. FABULOUS. Tap-dancing on a streamliner train. George Burns and Gracie Allen in black face.
American college kids put into a eugenics program in 1936.
What part of this do you not understand?
OMG.",1407283200,,245,4.72093023255814
