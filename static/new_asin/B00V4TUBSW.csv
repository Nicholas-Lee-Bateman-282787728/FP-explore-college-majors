7076417,2,B00V4TUBSW,"REALLY PEOPLE....WTF
First off i just want to say that if you're making a film that focuses on the effects (gore) in this particular case then i suggest you wait until you have enough funds to pay for realistic looking ones, i mean seriously the original Guinea Pig Flower of Flesh and Blood had much more realism is the effects department that this one, and The Flower was made in the 80's. thankfully i found this one for only $7.99 at a local retailer. i could get into the details of what was wrong with this but it would take too much typing and i'm sure most of you wouldn't want to spend alot of time reading it all. the one thing i will mention is that on the back of the case it states ""one of the most f***ed up endings ever, yeah right (insert laughter here). if you want to see a f***ed up ending to a film then watch the ""real"" uncut version of A Serbian Film or maybe Subconscious Cruelty (second short film within the film). in short this is nothing more than a pile of rubber, kayro syrup and carelessness.",1438041600,12,1022,4.246153846153846
7076418,5,B00V4TUBSW,"If u loved the van bebber stuff. And if u loved guinea pig series u will love this a must have. I got it on pre sale but the extras interviews are all work 20 bu ks to get the movie in bluray. ,sound track and all the extras its a must have. Can't wait till the next in hopefully a long series if American Guinea pig .... That is a tad of a spoiler.  But look forward u will as soon as you see this epic re lases cult classic.",1438041600,2,426,3.681318681318681
7076419,5,B00V4TUBSW,Excellent!! So happy to see a movie made with some balls!! Great movie!!,1438041600,,72,4.615384615384615
7076420,5,B00V4TUBSW,"This movie is fantastic, the filmography and gore is top notch, you couldn't ask for a better film that pays homage to the originals. Can't wait for ""Blood Shock"" to be released!",1437523200,,178,4.59375
7076421,1,B00V4TUBSW,"This was horrible the quality sucks yes they are going for a VHS/8MM look but it still sucked the ""acting"" was horrible (""NO!! the Right I said always on the right (come on just shut the F up already!!)), and I mean come on really the GORE was all this was really about right???? SO why did the effects looks so freak-en fake. GORE fans do not bother, because if your a real GORE fan you will see how stupid and fake the effects look.. I seen better of SCIFY's Face-off. Holds no comparison to the O.G Guinea PIG films (other than ripping them off)..... I will stick with Fred Fogel's movies to get my realistic movie gore fix.",1437004800,9,627,4.277310924369748
7076422,5,B00V4TUBSW,Not for the squeamish,1436140800,2,21,4.5
7076443,5,B00V4TUBSW,Not the kind of movie you buy for a major story line but definitely one you purchase for the pure gore and special effects. Not many horror movies can make me cringe or be as excited at the makeup effects the way I was as a child with movies like American Werewolf in London or The Thing. This movie gives me hope that good old fashioned makeup effects aren't being thrown out for stupid CGI. The gore in this film is amazing and well worth it. I'd reccomend this to any true horror fan. But be prepared for some serious gore that is unrelenting and all out gross in the best way!!!!,1445817600,,583,4.214285714285714
7076444,4,B00V4TUBSW,"Deliberately paced vivisections are the meat of this nearly plotless gore exploration, which in quite a few ways tops the original Japanese Guinea Pig series whence it sprung. Although many will complain of the lack of dramatic content, this movie is a hideous spectacle that displays creativity in ways other than developing an interesting ""plot"" or ""characters""...and these ways are for the most part exceedingly nasty. Some angles and films stocks and effect look more realistic than others, but most of the rough stuff plays pretty well or very well.

It is no small achievement that after nearly an hour of carnage, Biro, Koch, Bebber, and company manage plumb the most disturbing depths in the final gore sequences and epilogue. Included are some quite memorable usages of needles, a crucifix, and branch clippers...",1445040000,2,822,5.180451127819549
7076445,1,B00V4TUBSW,"So incredibly BORING! Wow, does this film DRAG. Terrible fx. Looked like rubber dolls. The worst part of this film other than how slow it is, the ""acting""! If you can even call it that! I don't expect much from low budget b films like this, but WOW. I cringed! And not at the gore, because that was nothing to cringe over. Luckily I watched this on YOUTUBE for FREE. I was SHOCKED to see it selling on here for $25?! I feel sorry for anyone who wasted their money on this, and even more sorry for those that actually thought this was good.",1442016000,3,539,4.1923076923076925
7076446,5,B00V4TUBSW,This is the quintessential gore film. This film follows in the footsteps of their Japanese Guinea Pig predecessors. The Guinea Pig films could be considered part of the Japanese erotic grotesque or Ero Guro art movement. I did a review on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/O4e0oEr_zxk,1442016000,2,281,5.409090909090909
7076447,1,B00V4TUBSW,Big disappointment here. The gore FX are well done but I was so bored by the lack of any plot that I dozed off a couple times.,1441584000,2,126,3.7037037037037037
7076448,1,B00V4TUBSW,"When i herd they ere doing an American Gini Pig film I though ""oh man this is going to be good"". I was wrong. Yea yea its bloody, yea yea its basically the same as the first Gini Pig with the girl being drugged and cut up.  Yea yea the effects are.....well ok, not the best it was as if everyone was a water balloon find with red stuff we do not bleed as much as they do in this no matter how much you cut up we just are not a human blood balloon. I guess i am telling you what i didn't like so ill go on. I hated the loose story they just had to add. That really annoyed me, i hated the surfer dude with the long hair who tried to turn what should of been a faceless cutter into a caricature. What made the original so good was no masks the fact that the guy doing the cutting was almost an afterthought they barely focused on him and he did not have silly masks on. Its been a hundred years since i saw the original so i might be wrong about the masks but i don't remember any. The effects were not that great and the filmmakers just couldn't leave it as is, they had to add a dumb story and silly caricatures which just annoyed me. None of them were scary they were all acting how a scary person acts. The side story of one of thems family is being held hostage was almost enough to turn it off but like my buddie Tanner i stuck with it and man it was hard. This film is boring. And let me tell you why. The absence of reason made the original random and scary, the addition of loose caricatures and silly subplots made it ....silly since the caricatures were not fully developed you felt like there was something missing. By not having something you feel its random and scary by hinting at silly s*** you just feel half there. So yea this film was half there and very boring thats the worst part it drags and is SOOOOO boring and i waited months for this film so let down.",1441065600,9,1876,4.016042780748663
7076449,3,B00V4TUBSW,"Good Gore, but it' could beging better.",1440806400,,39,4.714285714285714
7076450,5,B00V4TUBSW,"Pretty much plays out like an updated version of the Guinea Pig : Flower of Flesh and Blood episode. Two women are gassed, kidnapped, and taken to a clandestine location and slowly dismantled and dismembered while they are being filmed. This movie has a very minimal plot, which is a good thing in my opinion, its all about the guts and gore as it should be for a movie like this. It achieves the look of a snuff film very well, with its combination of grainy 8mm and VHS footage. If you don't like gore-fests, snuff films or found footage films, stay away from this movie.",1439769600,4,573,4.415094339622642
7076451,1,B00V4TUBSW,"dont bother waste of time, the gore fx were excellent that marcus koch did. Hats off to the man hes one of the best fx guys in the buisness.
other than the quality of the fx,the movie falls short.
real indie directors don't have 1000,s of dollars to put a film together,this is a bit of  mainsteam/pretending to be underground package.
theres no point in comparing it to the original series as this is just a spin off. Nothing to see here theres many better real indie movies out there and coming out,keep your money and wait for the genuine indie guys films,the guys that do make there films from just a few dollars.indie never was about having known actors /actresses or loads of money to chuck at its fx. REAL indie undreground stuff is made on a shoe string budget,friends as actors,back yard fx,and filmed on home cam,s all put together and packaged by the guy who made the film,no airs,no graces,but a top quality real underground experience. THIS FILM AGP IS NONE OF THAT, AND IT FALLS SHORT ON EVERY LEVEL!!!",1439683200,3,1016,4.551912568306011
7076452,4,B00V4TUBSW,"If you have seen the original from the 80's do you're self a huge favor and don't expect this one to even come close . But if you like a lot of people haven't had the pleasure of seeing the original or simply cannot afford it then this is a good one to hold you over . Granted the gore was at least hands on FX and not cgi so it gets points for that . However with that being said the gore really could have been much more realistic had they had enough funds to do it right .  But I think for the modern day as in younger viewers this will be brutal enough for them . They really should have filmed the whole movie with at least vhs cameras or better yet 16 mm . The picture for me was to clear and it really needed that grainy crusty look to it to make it so much better . Of course I optied for the 3 disk pre sale version . It was a good deal and I am happy enough with it, Just wish the FX were a little better .  I find of you watch it on an older dvd/vhs dual deck player with an old analog tv it is more enjoyable as it looks a little older . I had to but it and any other that may come in the series as it's part of a larger collection .",1438473600,,1145,3.6504065040650406
8709105,4,B00V4TUBSW,This video was far better than the other.  Much more of what I was expecting and kept the gore factor in tact. Makes saw look like a Disney movie.,1520121600,,146,4.0344827586206895
8709106,5,B00V4TUBSW,"Was very intense. Definitely something you watch to test your limits. I had met the director of the film in Texas and was unfortunately a while before I could buy it but it was definitely worth the wait! One of the most visceral and hardcore movies Ive ever seen. The special effects were some of the best Ive ever seen for its budget. Of course there were some you could tell they were just that but the better outweighs the worse in this case. The little dialogue there was could have been delivered a bit better half of the time but it wasn't really the most important aspect either way. This isn't for everybody. This isn't for the feint of heart. And this certainly isn't for everyone who claims to be a horror fan. If you don't try too hard to criticize it, because it wasn't made in Hollywood on a multimillion dollar budget, then youll accept it for what it was.",1514332800,,870,4.3765432098765435
8709107,5,B00V4TUBSW,"If you love gore, this is the movie for you! It will make you feel queasy, uneasy and question your mentality.",1508284800,,110,4.285714285714286
8709108,5,B00V4TUBSW,"I'm a huge fan of the ""snuff"" genre. This film, by far, has the most impact when watched(next to Bloodshed). That being said. It's clearly a behind-the-scenes look at the production of a ""snuff"" film, and while the voice-overs and bodies of the victims could be slightly more realistic. Example... flesh tears versus a clean line. All that aside, and keeping in mind the Japanese version, this film will really stand out to a seasoned gore fan. Finally, if you don't know why ""snuff"" exists, or are not keen on violence and lack of empathy... then please watch something else you'll have nothing but negative comments and you may be scared for life:)",1496361600,2,650,4.761061946902655
8709109,2,B00V4TUBSW,Yeah i like gore n horror but this is like 73mins of crap. Nothing like the original japanese series..,1489968000,,102,4.421052631578948

8709111,3,B00V4TUBSW,"Quite honestly I found myself Googling and checking Facebook a lot during this movie. I do hunt extreme horror and try to watch all that is released, being a huge fan of movies like Martyrs, Texas Chainsaw, Saw, most Rob Zombie movies, Human Centipide and many others. This movie was just - sorry to say - boring. There was absolutely no story beside two drugged women laying paralized and being tortured in the most brutal ways.
The gore was there, good thing, but without a storyline or some believable characters it's just something you watch because you're a horrorfan and long for that next gore-fix. You've got it, but truly this is not a good movie.",1462665600,3,656,4.663793103448276
