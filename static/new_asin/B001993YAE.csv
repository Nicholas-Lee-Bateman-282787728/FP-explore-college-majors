8272979,5,B001993YAE,"Port Charles was the perfect ""escape"" from so many things going on in reality at the time it aired.  The dynamic of Caleb's story and the love story of the ""evil"" vampire couple of Calivia was timeless.  Alison and Rafe were the ""good"" couple and brought a lot to the show as well.  I really think PC was ahead of its time....the supernatural theme is all the rage now but wasn't then.  I do love that GH just paid tribute to it recently but made me crave my own copy of the arcs to watch when I wanted...made me miss it all over again. This show should be released on DVD or BluRay.  What I cannot understand is how the GH Nightshift spinoff IS available.  I would buy PC in a heartbeat and I know I'm not alone!!!",1363392000,8,715,4.144927536231884

8272981,5,B001993YAE,"The timing for this show doomed it.  Had it caught the full Buffy and later Twilight fanbase it would still be on.

I loved the ""books"" and long for ABC to release them to DVD where I would purchase them in a NY minute!  The vampire Caleb, Angels (especially Rafe) and so on were a lovely echo of Dark Shadows in years gone by and I hated it being canceled.  Even my husband watched.",1359763200,14,383,4.135135135135135
