8395208,2,B003E1WW0I,This DVD is too hard to follow and some of the movements seem unsafe to me.  He needs to include more easy to follow atheletic moves.,1361923200,,133,4.115384615384615
8395209,4,B003E1WW0I,"I love Patrick Goudeau, but this is not my absolute favorite dvd he's put out.  It's challenging, but a couple of moves are a tad confusing.  I don't do this as frequently as his other dvds, but I do reach for it every now and then.  You will work up a sweat, but it may take a little time to get the moves down.",1352851200,,312,3.84375
8395210,5,B003E1WW0I,"I am an advanced exerciser and I found this DVD to be challenging and fun.  Some of the moves were a little tricky at first, but the variety made the workout go by fast.  This was a good work-out, no wasted time.",1281398400,,212,4.023809523809524
8395211,5,B003E1WW0I,"I've been doing follow-along workouts for over 20 years.  During that time, I've worked out with over 200 dvds and tapes.  Patrick's Hard Work Conditioning 24/7 is one of the best workouts I've ever seen and used.  I had many of Patrick's dvds before I picked this one up so I was already familiar with the innovative and effective moves he does.  Already a big fan of Hard Work Conditioning, I really looked forward to getting this one and it sure didn't disappoint.  HWC 24/7 builds perfectly on HWC.

This workout includes it all and you feel this one all over.  My heart rate stays up throughout the workout but it never leaves me feeling drained.  I always feel energized and great when I do it.  Patrick is encouraging and informative which only adds to the enjoyment of the workout.  HWC 24/7 covers the upper body, lower body and core well then ends with a thorough stretch.

If you're looking for an effective, fun workout that's unique and you really look forward to doing, get Hard Work Conditioning 24/7.",1273881600,4,1016,4.620111731843576
