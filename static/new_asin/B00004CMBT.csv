7920003,5,B00004CMBT,"What can I say that Mr. Zaworksi didn't put in his review here. It's wonderfully watchable by scientists and non-scientists alike. Not only incredibly accurate and comprehensive in its history of the earth's climate, but amazingly accurate in its predictions now that a couple of decades have passed since it's release. Entertaining, yet chilling. A must see for everyone.",1265673600,2,372,5.322033898305085
7920004,1,B00004CMBT,"Following on the wonderful Connections, and the somewhat disappointing Connections 2, Burke launches into a scare fantasy which, 20 years later, we can see just how off his rocker he really was.

His presentations are excellent, of course, which when I first saw them in the early-mid 90's were very scary.

In this production, he tells us about all of the warming related disasters coming our way, which, fortunately for us some 15 years later, none of which ever remotely came to pass.  Included in this were:

1997-1999, Massive drought in Ukraine and US: American grain failure, hundreds of thousands die of starvation
2000, sea levels up 1' since 1994 (in reality, it was about 1"")
2007, no water in Mexico City, 3rd world coastal regions destroyed by hurricanes, causing mass migration
2008, Major nuclear power plant accidents, and 100's of thousands dead from hurricanes in Miami and other places
2010, millions more dead from starvation... and 3 degrees warming in the last 15 years (there has been only about 0.45 degrees, and no warming in the last 10 years)

He predicts cheap solar panels (PVs) by 2003, and that certainly never happened.

He also predicted that the mighty Japanese would be running everything...

So, I just spent the last 20 years scared out of my pants by this program, filled with scares, none of which even remotely came to pass.

If you get this, be sure to get it to see just how wrong journalists can be about important issues.

The only predictions he got remotely close to right have nothing to do with climate, only with human activity... like carbon trading (which is a self fulfilling prophesy, as this show clearly tried to promote it), the problem is, the disasters that were supposed to have made this meaningful did not happen.",1248652800,9,1774,4.8283828382838285
7920005,5,B00004CMBT,"I am thoroughly impressed with James Burke's prophetic ""After the Warming"" program.  I viewed this back in the early 1990s and was struck by not only the scientific and historic accuracy of the film, but also the prophetic retrospective of the film.

Set in 2050, Burke looks back at the events of the world going back to the dawn of civilization,and shows how the climate changes effected human history.  At the point of the Industrial Revolution, humans started to do things to the climate, rather than the other way round.  When he brings us up to date (1989), that is when the predictions begin.  From Kyoto to the two Gulf Wars, Burke accurately predicts many of the events that have taken place so far.  His predictions have been sound, even to the tune of carbon credits and climate change agreements.

Long before Al Gore, there was James Burke.  His Connections series was all about science and technology, and how they effect human history and culture.  This science prediction film is quite compelling and worth a view.",1202774400,11,1030,4.806818181818182
7920006,3,B00004CMBT,"A pre-cursor to ""An inconvenient truth,"" by the accomplished and much-more-personable-than-Al-Gore James Burke, perhaps best known to American PBS audiences for his remarkable ""Connections"" series and its less remarkable follow-up series. However, like Gore, offering anecdotes and incomplete pictures leaves the viewer with a sense of such absolute desperation that one might actually accept Burke's draconian measures for ""curing"" the world of its excesses (""greenhouse lunacies""). My guess -- I won't call it a scientific estimate -- is that we are more likely to run out of oil than detroy the earth with carbon-based fuels. The same market and pricing mechanism that was fueled by the cheap energy boom will likely direct us by need to an alternative before we destroy the earth. Burke does not believe in self-correcting markets. When Burke characterizes Thomas Edison's desire to improve products as the invention of consumerism, I think he overstepped. Consumerism does not mean ""new and improved,"" it means ""buying lots of unneeded stuff for no good reason."" Mass production helped get people off the farms, but they made only a brief stop in factories on their way to jobs in the service industry, providing services that really do sustain life, services like education and health care. Those activities barely existed before nasty mass production and consumerism surfaced.",1177804800,5,1383,5.407407407407407
7920007,5,B00004CMBT,"I already had been raised in a scientific environment busy discussing the chemisrty of the greenhouse effect when ""after the warming"" played on PBS between 2am and 4am on a tuesday.  I was pleased to see such a timely and moving warning and excited that finally basic chemistry was hitting the mainstream.  But it was not to be.  No, it has been another two decades of venerating and rewarding the most irresponsible human generation ever.  The industrialists of the world employ many to their bidding, which while being efficient to achieve their ends, are not efficient for achieving sane ends.  So twenty years later the occidental petroleum scion who was sent in to scuttle the Kyoto accords, and has been lying for power longer than I been alive, is lauded for awaking the world to the issue.  After the Warming had all the science in Inconvieniet Gore (If not up to date inevitably) and more idea's and solutions too.  They were supposed to be implemented in the nineties, but obstructionists in the white house kept the door to rationality shut.  Great show, reminds you how long all this has been common sense, obfuscated by criminals, now used and manipulated by criminals.  Read Transmetropolitan too!  BTW-I have not seen the show again so my comments may have some discrepancies...

an inconvienient Truth's message is:- Gore could save us if he just had enough power... like he did not have enough already- the true message is, if he really does want the changes he claims, is, either he is totally ineffective personally,

or the system is completely ossified and useless for intelectually based action",1173657600,9,1616,4.900735294117647
