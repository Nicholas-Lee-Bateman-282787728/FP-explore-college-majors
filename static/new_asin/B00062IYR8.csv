I bought for my daughter's Sweet 16 as a gag. Her nick name was "" Ava"" growing up & we're HUGE Patrick Dempsey fans!!! Thought it would have him in a more prominent role, but was Still cute ;-) My  daughter thought it was funny, in a ""B movie"" sorda way. Recommend it IF u don't intended to allow children to see it, it's labeled as ""children & family"" so we got an education.",1343692800,,427,4.083333333333333
