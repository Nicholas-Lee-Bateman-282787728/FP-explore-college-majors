6647653,5,B00ND0DC9A,Great comedy series. Wish it was still on TV. Every episode is a gem.,1418601600,,69,4.0
6647654,5,B00ND0DC9A,I enjoyed Dads when it was on and was disappointed when it was canceled. I'm glad that I was able to purchase Season 1. I haven't had an problems with my DVDs.,1417737600,3,159,4.0
6647655,5,B00ND0DC9A,"One of my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE shows is now (and FINALLY) on DVD!!! So sad the show was canceled but having this DVD gives me a little bit of comfort because i can get to my ""Dads"" world anytime i want now =) PLUS DVD includes the last and never aired episode!!! Can i just tell you how much i love Seth Green in this?!? He SHINES in his role as Eli Sachs!!! I'm really happy i got this DVD <3",1417564800,,392,3.9125
6647656,3,B00ND0DC9A,"I was impressed with some of antics that took place throughout the series, but they were overshadowed with a lot of jokes that were just misses or offensive to be offensive. A few breakout episodes, but for the most part, not that great of a show. Finale ended on an extremely low note.",1417564800,3,286,4.415094339622642
6647657,4,B00ND0DC9A,"Dad's is this strange sitcom @ First it tried to be way to edgy and shocking way to soon into the season!
and the show payed for it from the start it got major negative attention from the jump!
Which is very sad 'Cause once it found it's voice it actually got very smart and lol funny!
Go out of your way to see the episode ""Oldfinger""  on paper it sounds very lazy and cheap But, I assure you it was very ""smart"" and well written
This show might have got major unnecessary Due to the fact it can be very ""Dry""  many of the jokes will make you cringe
which isn't a Bad thing tv viewers in general have got stupid and want everything spoon feed to them look at all the sitcoms with the  unnecessary canned laughter
The Cast is very strong everyone plays it straight through-out
Tonita Castro as Edna steals every scene see is in

FOX does what is does Best canceled it without even trying and the final episode was a real downer.... The way it played out
But, yet that train wreck called Brooklyn Nine-Nine was picked-up for a second season  (How on earth is Andy Samberg This Comedy genius??? The dude is a true hack and gets a pass.
Really Hollywood how is he blackmailing to get NO Negative press
It's a real shame FOX can never get behind any ""New""  Property unless it's over-done animation or Fake reality shows

It's NOT the best Comedy in years But, it's the Best comedy Fox has put out in a long time
It's odd both FX and FXX played episodes during the Fox airing (which i don't understand since FOX kept it's distance after all the Negative attention and tried to bury it as soon as they could!
This show in general is very watchable and enjoyable
If you like Show's Like the ""Original"" BBC's The Office or Extras you'll get this sitcom and actually like it very much  8.5/10",1416787200,5,1783,4.3014925373134325
6647658,5,B00ND0DC9A,"This is a very funny show. I love it. It is sad that the show did not get renewed. It is about 2 friends who own a video game company together and both have their dads move in with them. The Dads put a damper on their home lives and bring some funny moments to the table. I hope this DVD set includes the not shown on TV episode 19 which was only released on On Demand, Fox.com, and Hulu.com.",1411776000,15,392,3.9125

6647660,5,B00ND0DC9A,"This was one of the funniest comedies Fox has ever shown.  Sure it goes for the easy laugh with occasional racist or offensive lines, but it does so in a light-hearted way.  I fully expected it to only last one season, so I'm disappointed that it ended on a cliff-hanger.  The extra episode that wasn't shown on TV puts the DVD over the top.  This is one DVD purchase worth a yearly view.",1447718400,2,388,4.273972602739726

8677503,3,B00ND0DC9A,"The humor in Dads is typical sitcom humor, although it probably rings better for men; I don't know, but I would surmise it. It lacks the hilarious female characters that make me laugh out loud. However, as a male, I do find the situations to be funny. I identified personally with the father-son relationships, and they brought back memories of both my father and one grandfather. I enjoyed the series and found the purchase to be quite worthwhile.",1520812800,,448,4.756410256410256

8677508,5,B00ND0DC9A,"Great! From the creators of Family Guy and Ted. I saw this on TV when I still watched TV and fell in love with it. Too bad it got cancelled due to it being labeled as racist. It's not but a lot of people couldn't stand having any fun getting poked around. And unfurtunately Seth MacFarlane does that a lot, he leaves no corners untouched.

Still I am glad I could buy it on DVD thanks to Olive Films. Will cherish it and try to get as many laughs out of it.",1482451200,,457,3.967391304347826
