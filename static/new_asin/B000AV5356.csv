3499693,5,B000AV5356,I had the whole Power Half Hour series on one dvd. It got broken and I loved it so much that I wanted to get them individually! It is a great target workout and perfect for days when you can't get to the gym or outside for a run!,1365379200,,229,3.693877551020408
3499694,4,B000AV5356,Tony Horton's 30 minute exercise videos are a good work out.  I would recommend them to anyone who was interested in exercising at home.,1363478400,,136,4.666666666666667
3499695,5,B000AV5356,Tony does it again! Works you hard and makes you laugh while you do it. Excellent thigh with light cardio workout. You will sweat!,1361836800,,130,4.458333333333333
3499696,4,B000AV5356,I love the short 30 minute work outs and this one is good for cardio as well as isolating the thighs. I enjoy Tony Horton as a fitness instructor.,1298246400,2,146,4.068965517241379
3499697,5,B000AV5356,"Tony Horton's Thigh Trimmer workout was THE most fun I've ever had from a work out dvd.  He starts you off right away with the warm-up/workout and progresses into squats, lunges, curtsey's, jogging in place and ""riding on a horse"" moves with many repeaters.  Then you do leg lifts, curls and side thigh lifts while supporting yourself upright with a chair. Then your calves get a workout with lifts on your toes in three different postions.  I found myself sweating and out of breath, leg muscles burning, while still laughing out loud at Tony's comments and humorous antics.  He's an excellent instructor, offering many helpful hints and encouragement. I would definitely buy more workout videos by Mr. Horton again.",1235952000,7,717,5.0
3499698,5,B000AV5356,"I have this particular workout (which I happened to do again this morning) as part of a DVD which contains all the Power Half Hour Workouts.

This one focuses on lots of Squat, Lunge variations, Kickboxing (only the kicking part no punches), and many combinations of lunges w/kicks. There's also some specific Abductor work as well as some unweighted leg extensions and leg curls.

Between specific lower body work Tony has you doing various cardio type movements to keep your heart rate up so you definitely get a medium intensity/low impact type cardio workout at the same time.

Because you aren't using weights the emphasis is on high reps which really helps keep your heart rate up as well

The workout starts with a warm up, then the main body of the workout and then after the 30 minute clock runs out there's a few minutes of cooldown. At most the whole thing is 35 or so minutes.

Here's a complete breakdown:

Warm up: Run in place/swing arms and legs side to side/mini butt kicks/run in place

Four way squat (feet close, medium, wide, really wide)

3 way rear lunge/leg raise in front combo (same leg lunges and then is raised across, front, to the side)
3 way rear lunge/front kick combo
Stab-lunge to the front, then step back and kick to the front (same leg lunges and kicks)

Cardio break (run in place/butt kicks/high knees/wide high knees)

3 direction kicks (low, med, high), first kick across the body, then to the front, then to the side
Front lunge, step back, then rear lunge combo (use same leg to lunge to the front then the back)

Cardio break (run in place, run in a large circle, butt kicks, wide high knees)

Curtsey lunge (all on 1 side, then switch sides)
Curtsey lunge/kick combo (use same leg to lunge diagonally to the rear and then to kick to the front)

Cardio break (butt kicks (moving forwards and backwards/high knees/wide high knees)

Double Curtsey lunge (alternating sides)
Double Curtsey lunge/Kick combo
Skaters (side to side)
Toe Raises (out front in)

Leaning hamstring curls
Standing leg extensions
Standing Side (abductor) raises
(Repeat curls/extension/side raises)

Toe raises (out/front/in)

Cool down (run in place/gentle kick-march)

Stretch: wide legs/reach arms overhead/wide leg side stretch/wide leg forward bend (also stretch to each side in this position then back to center)

The Power Half Hour workouts are extremely effective in packing a lot into a short time period. I'd recommend buying the whole set which comes on one dvd. You need very little equipment (resistance bands for upper body work on one of the other programs, and a chair to use for balance).

If one commits to rotating these workouts throughout most days of the week you can definitely get great results.

My wife originally bought it as a preparation for doing P90X (she had already done Slim In 6) and I started using after P90X for some of my maintenance workouts. I was extremely surprised by how intense these little workouts are, they are a LOT tougher than their name implies.

Still, in spite of their intensity, you can modify them to meet your current level of fitness by just going slow, doing less reps, not going as deep into the movements etc.

I'd recommend doing something like ""Power 90"" by Beachbody first if you are totally out of shape and then use this program to step up the intensity and specificity.

Power 90 works the whole body in circuits, where the Power Half Hour programs focus more specifically on either upper body, thighs, buns, abs (the Ab burner is also a mixture of cardio and ab work which makes sense since if you want to see your abs you've got to lose fat), and stretching.

Tony Horton has a gift for designing programs that are efficient, effective and require minimal equiptment and floor space. I've done these on vacation in relatively small areas and brought resistance bands with me for the upper body workout. Also, Tony is a character so be prepared to laugh and have fun while you're working hard! :)

Highly recommended for folks who are willing to put in the work. These are NOT magic bullets, these are real exercise routines where you have to make a real effort. BUT this is the only way to get real results!",1211846400,,4195,4.743801652892562

Also, video seems pre hi-def which makes the quality seem dated. It does include some cardio.",1406764800,,243,4.951219512195122
