8393684,3,B003BJO8P0,"A second, early entrance (1965) on a western movie by Italian director, Sergio Corbucci; this movie followed after 1964s Massacre at Grand Canyon. The movie remains interesting because it has some Spaghetti western style elements that will be more obvious during Sergio Corbuccis subsequent films. Most notably, our hero, casted by Cameron Mitchell (best known by his great role as uncle Bob in The High Chaparral), gets in between two bad sides, a Mexican gang of outlaws and an American gang led by the corrupt Sheriff owning the main town. Yet, the film also shares some classic lines, more typical of the classic American Westerns. I share some of the views of previous reviewers in that the best Corbucci western films were still to come. Still, I enjoyed this film, including seeing Ethel Rojo as sexy Estella better though.

I am not an expert on Spaghetti Western history, yet the extent to which Corbucci developed his style independently from that of his fellow Director, Sergio Leone, remain an open question to me. On the one hand, Leones 1964 A Fistful of Dollars suggests some influence on Corbucci. However, some of his later films such as The Great Silence showed some sharp different ways too.

Technically, I own a region free, Shoarma Digital DVD copy. Based on a reviewers comment, the transfer is probably the same, with a nice Widescreen format, vivid colors, English language, and no subtitles. At the very end, and after the final confrontation, you have what seemed to be an alternative, good ending added. It runs for about 3-4 min and comes in Italian language with English subtitles. Not a problem to me, but clearly this addition changed the mood to the movie. Extras include the original trailer.",1413590400,,1726,4.927835051546392
8393685,4,B003BJO8P0,"Right off let's just say that this release from VCI is nothing short of excellent, a nice widescreen transfer with bold colors, a visual treat for Spaghetti Western fans. That alone makes this a must-buy, but there are others reasons, some good, despite the bad and...

THE GOOD: A proto DJANGO as if Corbucci were just warming up. But really more like an American Western of the 1950s, just before the ""Spaghetti Style/Look"" was fully developed by Leone, Tessari, Corbucci and others. The Italians loved American Westerns as the death scene of a henchman in this film, paying homage to Ford's STAGECOACH, testifies.
Mitchell is just great as the well-worn Minnesota Clay. He's always been an underrated actor who can do this stuff in his sleep.
Fernando Sancho delivers what is to be expected of him, over the top, scenery-chewing histrionics. No one does it as well or is as enjoyable.
Lots of familiar gang members, making one of their first go-rounds, in multiple death scenes.
High body count.
Lots of gunplay and violence.

THE BAD: Not the best dubbing, acceptable, but often awkward. Better attention to dialog translation (not VCI's fault) would have made this a much better film.
The crappy, cop-out uncut Italian ending which is pure hokum (in Italian with English subtitles) that appears tacked on as if a last minute afterthought. The American release ending, assuming that Clay may be dying, is more in tone with the mood of the film.

THE UGLY: Clay's befuddled daughter and twit boyfriend are annoying to no end. They both have far too much screen time. I believe that if they were killed off in the first reel then this may have become a major rather than minor classic.

However, we do have Corbucci's FIRST maimed hero, preceeding Django and Silence (THE GREAT SILENCE) who despite physical handicaps fights back to overcome overwhelming odds. Django won, Silence lost...Minnesota Clay???

Watch it yourself, whatever ending you prefer.
I really liked it. I hope you will too.
It's simply a must-see from the early years of the Spaghetti Western, conventional to American standards yet still surprising in sheer European style.

And, really, Piero Piccioni's soundtrack is also quite fetching, a mix of the two cultures seemlessly blending as one.
For Spaghetti Western or Cameron Mitchell fans, this is essential viewing.",1356480000,3,2341,5.020618556701031
8393686,3,B003BJO8P0,"This film is arguably better than NAVAJO JOE, but not nearly as compelling as HELLBENDERS, as creative and entertaining as COMPANEROS and MERCENARY, nor as sobering as THE GREAT SILENCE.",1339286400,2,186,5.233333333333333
