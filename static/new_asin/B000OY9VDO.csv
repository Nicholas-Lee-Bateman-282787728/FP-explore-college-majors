My girls (ages 5 & 7) LOVE this show, and I can sit through it as well :)  The episodes are action-packed, edgy enough to be interesting to my girls, but still wholesome with nice life-lessons.  The horses are great, the storylines are engaging, and I highly recommend this series.  We also have the first one, Friends First, which is great too.",1186963200,6,368,4.53030303030303
