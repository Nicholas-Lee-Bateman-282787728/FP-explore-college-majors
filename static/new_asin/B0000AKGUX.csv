1907689,5,B0000AKGUX,"There is much to agree with in all three previous reviewers' assessments, despite their divergent evaluations.  Borodin's Prince Igor and this production have their flaws.  The libretto is banal; this is no Boris Godunov!  Kirov's scenery, though well painted, is for the most part only that.  We, as lovers of musical drama, which opera is, should demand more, especially of DVDs; others, like the Met, provide infinitly better stagecraft.  Finally, the makeup and headgear of the two principal Polovitsi:  Vaneev (as Konchak) and Borodina (as his daughter) is laughable.  Olga Borodina is a beautiful woman, but one would never know it from this production.  Fortunately, lesser Polovitsi have not been so encumbered; the costumes of the Rus are well designed, and those of the ballet are delightful.  As for the stagecraft, despite its limitations, it is far more effective than that of the widly applauded Glyndebourne production of Le Nozze di Figaro.  But while Figaro is a work of great popularity (at least, for opera)and one already has a choice multiple DVD productions, we are unlikely to see a finer recording of Prince Igor than this.

Borodin's Prince Igor and the Kirov's production have much to offer:  a lush, sensual music, unlike any other opera's.  Borodin's music is remarkable, and Prince Igor contains much of his finest. The soloists and chorus of the Kirov opera have rich, full voices, and they are effective actors, as well.  And the  Kirov ballet's spectacular production of the Polovitsian Dances is unlikely to be equaled anywhere.  The DVD's cinematography is excellent and in widescreen; its sound quality is superb.  So wait another generation in the hopes of finding a better audiovisual production if you like, but meanwhile I suggest you enjoy this one.",1091232000,67,1789,5.134948096885813
1907690,2,B0000AKGUX,"I'm not going to add much to the previous reviews: if you like old fashioned opera then this production is for you, if you like opera as drama, then avoid: buy the CD instead. Musically the performance is up to the Kirov's exalted standards. I personally found the ear-rings seriously undermining at a couple of crucial moments and did wonder if this was in fact a European avant-garde production concept based on ear ware; they are so distracting (yes the Polovstians won because theirs are bigger!). Everyone knows that Borodin's opera is a leisurely dramatic experience, but in this performance I sensed that Gergiev was so conscious of this fact that the opera gets rushed off its feet in the final acts and this is emphasized by the SNIPPING at the music. A chunk of Jaroslavna's glorious last act aria goes (which is vandalism), and much more damaging dramatically, the trio when Igor escapes is cut, thus making the second act in the Polovstian camp seem even more perfunctory than it probably is, and robbing us of the one bit of real character conflict between Konchakovna (the wonderful Olga Borodina) Igor and Vladimir. Thus they hardly re-appear at all after the initial Polovstian act and are reduced to ciphers in the second part of the opera.  There used to be a version from the Royal Opera House on video with Haitink and an incredible Anna Tomova-Sintow, maybe not as plush vocally as Gorchakova but far more charismatic and involving; maybe that will appear on DVD soon. As for this one, I watched it once and will probably give it away to someone who doesn't know any better.",1075420800,46,1595,4.758122743682311
1907691,2,B0000AKGUX,"A star line up of some of the greatest russian singers in todays times.  Musically the orchestra under maestro Gergiev flourished.  The picture and sound quality of this DVD was again flawless. Where is the problem?  We are told on the sleave that this was the Kirov's magnificent 1998 production, and being aware of what Kirov productions are like I was prepared for some semi-tradititonal staging.  What I saw though was a production that resembled something that would be considered old fashioned in the nineteeth century.  Tired painted backcloths and bulky clumsy costumes, in some cases ridiculous make up more fit for the circus than on the stage (The Khan for one example).  I wonder if those at the cash strapped Kirov had got together and in an attempt at saving money had collected items and props from all their old productions mixed them together and called it a new production.",1069113600,34,891,4.867549668874172
7997433,5,B0000AKGUX,"I was impressed by the vigor of this production.  The sets were simple but effective.  I really liked the costuming because it clearly differentiated the various character groups.  The images were clear with a great color palette.  The video director used a lot of head shots so that facial expression becomes more important compared to seeing the same production from further away.  The sound was fine.  The program is spread over two disks.  I found that the opera as presented was dramatically compelling and the order of the scenes made sense -- unlike the Metropolitan Opera Version which I saw live and didn't care for.  The English subtitles were fine, though at times located a bit high on the screen making it hard to completely see a particular scene.  I do not have the background to authoritatively comment on the quality of the performances but I enjoyed them.  I was particularly impressed by Galina Gorchakova as Yaroslavna and the antics of the two Gudok players who reminded me of Ping, Pang and Pong from Turandot.",1494633600,2,1032,4.845714285714286
7997434,2,B0000AKGUX,"I have listened  to a complete version on CD including a latinized alphabet and English translation. Ut was confusing at times. This film is complete over 3 hours. Bad sound, the levels go from inaudible to shouting.
BUT the point is nothing can save the opera. Borodin's music is sometimes great, sometimes boring. Since the libretto doesn't make it, as far as this opera is concerned, who cares?",1470182400,,397,4.838235294117647

7997436,5,B0000AKGUX,"This production of PRINCE IGOR outclasses all other issues in my opinion (including the recent issue of the Met production). Using a  reconstructed score, which restores some of the music excised by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov (understandably at the time, given the unfinished and chaotic state of the work at Borodin's death), the Mariinsky offers a fine, idiomatic performance, with a naturalistic, period-correct mis-en-scene--no Eurotrash or directorial lunacy!  All of the principals acquit themselves vocally quite admirably, with special kudos to Galina Gorchakova (as Yaroslavna), Nikolai Putilin (as Prince Igor), Vladimir Vaneev (as Khan Konchak), and Olga Borodina (as Konchakovna). Gergiev gives fine leadership to the well-schooled Mariinsky forces. Very highly recommended.",1411257600,4,788,6.09009009009009

7997438,5,B0000AKGUX,"The story of Prince Igor originally take place in the Middle Ages, This was not the case with the MET presentation. Soldiers with rifles insted of spears, Modern dance replaces the ethnic folk dance etc. Those are the
 reasons that bring me to buy this magnificent production putting bach Borodin's Prine Igor in his context,  C.M.",1396656000,6,331,4.892857142857143
7997439,5,B0000AKGUX,"Beautiful ballet, and love the Marinsky...ballet, opera, concert......The ABT brought it to Los Angeles awhile ago.
I took my two little granddaughters to see it.  Not the Marinsky (which I did take them to down in Orange County a
couple of years ago) but still well done and worth while...both the DVD and the live one.",1381795200,3,320,4.714285714285714

7997441,5,B0000AKGUX,"There were some horrible reviews in this US edition of Amazon that put off my decision to go in for this one. Thank god many of the armchair critics like me are wrong many a time. People have criticized this production for stuff like 'old sets', costumes and even the way some characters, especially the Khan, has been portrayed. I find the costumes and make-up quite adequate and authentic, if one were to see the pics of these in various encyclopedias and so on. I wonder if that guy has seen a period caricature of Kublai Khan or even Gengiz Khan. They have both such mustaches as well as earrings as portrayed here. If it is deemed a 19th century production, all the better for people like me who prefer a bit of opulence even if the sets are a little lacking. Thank god we were not surprised with Igor in a Tuxedo and so on along with minimalist sets.

Anyone who knows the more popular Polovtzian Dances and the lesser known but fabulous overture composed by Glazunov incorporating many themes from this opera, can enjoy it without any problems.

I know that Kirov (Actually Mariyinksky) could and would do much better if the dances were performed separately for a DVD on ballet or on stage. But here, the rustic and crude nature of the Polovtzis is maintained well by lack of mechanical precision and one can see the dancers having a good time and so did I.

This production has some of the best singers, dancers and a great conductor. It has been shot quite well, and is never found wanting in its sound track. What more does one want in an Opera DVD?

Yes, Also remember, that this is PRINCE IGOR, and not BORIS GODUNOV. Keep that in mind too.",1277596800,18,1652,4.460264900662252
7997442,3,B0000AKGUX,I prefer the Provatorov version on VHS.  This Igor is not convincing.  Energy is missing.  Gergev is just good...not terrific.,1156291200,9,126,5.2
