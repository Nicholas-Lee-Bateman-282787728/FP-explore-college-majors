2857219,5,B000R349HU,"I love Helen Mirren's acting.  This last of the Prime Suspect series  and you can tell this in the episode.  I have all the Prime Suspect series and I have enjoyed all of them.  She is indeed ""a woman in a man's world"".",1191110400,2,219,4.023255813953488
2857220,4,B000R349HU,"""Prime Suspect 7: The Final Act"" finds Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) a 35-year veteran of the police force, weeks away from retirement, and struggling to keep her head above water as she solves her last case. The hysterical parents of 14-year-old Sallie Sturdy keep the pressure on to find their daughter's killer, as Tennison's alcoholism threatens to consume her personal and professional being. Tennison finds both an outlet for maternal instincts and a reminder of her own youth in Sallie's friend Penny Phillips (Laura Greenwood), who may know more than she is telling abut the crime. Penny's father and school headmaster (Stephen Tompkinson) and the girls' thuggish friend Curtis Flynn (Heshima Thompson) both have suspect connections to Sallie and suspect alibis. With no one, including Tennison, in full possession of his or her senses, this case careens toward its conclusion.

Without Helen Mirren's reticence and force of personality, this final episode of ""Prime Suspect"" would be pure melodrama. Many of the characters are so overwrought that I would expect to find them heavily medicated or institutionalized. ""Prime Suspect"" always included melodrama, but these performances are so hysterical that they undermine the show's gritty realism. I fault director Philip Martin for that. Helen Mirren's sharpness and deliberation prevent Jane Tennison from becoming a similar caricature. She grabs the audience's sympathies, even as Tennison's behavior is sometimes alienating. As a window on the weight that decades of grim work have placed on Jane Tennison's shoulders, ""The Final Act"" succeeds admirably. In other respects, this episode is flawed. And I couldn't help wondering if the writers' intention was to advocate the omnipresence of CCTV cameras in the UK by making the video footage out to be essential to crime-solving.

The DVDs (Acorn Media 2007): This is a 2-disc set with the first half of the film on Disc 1 and the conclusion on Disc 2 -an absurd waste of space in my view. Unlike some previous ""Prime Suspect"" DVDs, the film is in its proper 1.66:1 format, not full screen. Bonus features are on Disc 2, where you will find a ""Photo Gallery"" slide show of on-set photos and production stills, ""Cast Filmographies"" of 7 cast members, and a ""Prime Suspect: Behind the Scenes"" documentary (45 min). The documentary interviews producers and cast members from various ""Prime Suspect"" series, looks at the series' 15-year history, its inception, its themes, and inspirations. Also interviewed is Jackie Malton, the DCI who advised the first episode and on whom some of Jane Tennison's experiences were based.",1190764800,28,2653,5.2843601895734595
2857221,5,B000R349HU,"This wonderful DVD is listed incorrectly in the product details as

2857222,5,B000R349HU,"The best Prime Suspect was definitely saved for last. In Prime Suspect 6, Jane Tennison rose to an entirely new level as she fought insubordination and calls to retire, while solving a complex international murder. In Prime Suspect 7, Jane Tennison faces new challenges, but most of these challenges come from within, as she struggles with alcoholism and the death of her father, all while trying to solve her most challenging case yet. The drama and suspense of Prime Suspect 7 is as great as we have seen in the past, but what makes this Prime Suspect the best yet is the extraordinary depth of Jane Tennison. Helen Mirren delivers yet another brilliant and masterful performance in the role that has defined her career.",1181433600,30,722,4.830645161290323

D.C.I. Tennison has a strong sense of what she wants and needs from her career. She's dedicated, a fighter. She's a perfectionist and expects the same from everyone else so she pushes harder than most. Her personal life, however, is in shambles. Work consumes her.

2857311,1,B000R349HU,"The feel of this Prime Suspect is completely different from the previous six.  The director is different, for a start, and it was not written by Lynda LaPlante.  Apparently Lynda LaPlante hated this story and it's not hard to see why.

Yes, Helen Mirren does her best to rescue it but the implausible narrative arc, badly researched procedural work and heavy handed direction really stop this from being what it might have been.

The direction is everything that a good Brit cop show shouldn't be:  lots of clumsy incidental music (because we'e too stupid presumably to realize that a scene is REALLY IMPORTANT) lots of wobbly hand held cameras (to make it feel SO IMMEDIATE) and lots of quick cuts among camera angles (to remind us that this is happening REALLY FAST) all belong in an American TV cop show, not a Brit classic.

Mirren's acting can't be faulted but her character is not at all the character that we know from PS 1-6.  She is completely unsympathetic and the narrative arc of her personal story is threadbare.  The plot shifts are implausible and the secondary characters are totally two dimensional.

This is a travesty of Prime Suspect.  No wonder Lynda LaPlante hated this version.  I own it because I'm a PS fan, but I won't watch this one again.  Buy any of the first six (indeed, buy ALL of the first six) before you buy this piece of rubbish.",1438041600,3,1365,4.641666666666667

2857313,2,B000R349HU,"This series said CLOSED CAPTION and the English movies do need this, especially when you are hearing impaired.  The first six didn't have it but then my husband's earing wasn't so bad.  I found a complete set of Prime Suspect and most of them had the CC, so my husband enjoyed those. I had Prime Suspect 7 but didn't have closed caption.  This one stated CLOSED CAPTION so I purchased it.  Didn't provide CC and don't see why they advertise it as such when it isn't available.  Amazon was good enough to take it back and gave an instant refund.",1430870400,2,544,4.4

The writing was excellent too. In some cases, you knew who committed the murder, and you watched the team try to solve the case. In other shows, the team was at a complete loss as to who they should be searching for. The interesting difference between British detective shows and American is most of the British shows include a lot of ""office politics"" especially in regards to upward promotion. Sometimes Helen's character was told to lay off investigating if a high level person was involved. If she thought they were the correct culprit she hung on like a pit bull and solved the case!  The series shows what a high price she pays for being a woman in a male dominated field. Excellent series!",1410307200,,864,4.671052631578948

Her dedication to career leaves not much room for her personal life, but plenty of room for a whiskey bottle. There is an excellent supporting cast and the scripts are very good.

2857409,5,B000R349HU,Prime Suspect is to be commended for it's creativity.  There are usually two or more plots running simultaneously to keep one guessing.  The writing is adult -like and the talented actors are well chosen for their roles.,1404172800,,220,4.918918918918919
2857410,5,B000R349HU,Helen Mirren(off/ovna) delivers a final series performance that casts her among the doyens of theatre. She wells deserves accolades for her lifetime of distinguished performances. Thumbs up!,1403568000,,190,6.074074074074074

2857412,4,B000R349HU,"Very diverse plots & twists with this series. Helen Mirren was very good at portraying all the emotions tied to the position of a detective/superintendent.  Morals, trust, loyalty, dependence played a major part between the Police Force's police.  It was interesting that the series had only 1-2 episodes per season (except one season had 3 episodes).  As a woman, I understood her position among her male peers, as well as her male superiors. Very good acting on her part. The final episode had a good & appropriate ending.",1403222400,,524,4.931818181818182

2857416,5,B000R349HU,"I watched all seven seasons over the course of a month, and thought they were First Class.  I've seen reviews that attest to Helen Mirren's acting mastery which cannot be overstated.  She is SO good, it's no wonder she went on to win so many awards; but the series as a whole gets two thumbs up from me.  The supporting cast is impeccable in every single episode.  The writing is so well done that I found myself constantly reading 'between the lines' for clues, but seldom if ever being able to predict the outcome[s].  Obviously, there is also a number of superb directors and cinematographers who performed fabulously day after day, week in week out for YEARS!  Bravo to Granada for this wonderful contribution to television entertainment!  Thank you one and all.",1402531200,,766,4.757575757575758

2857430,3,B000R349HU,"The Tennison character was always flawed, and we liked that. But in the final season, she was such a drunken mess that she had become an embarrassment to her superiors and to us. She had good excuses, her father dying, etc., but she was a mean drunk, insulting her mother and sister, making a fool of herself with a teenage suspect, and just not taking care of business in general. I guess the writers wanted us to be happy that she was retiring and not be pestering the network executives to bring her back.",1401235200,,508,4.414893617021277

2857449,5,B000R349HU,"Season 7 of the Prime Suspect Series was an excellent finale to a series 15 years in the making.  Helen Mirren's portrayal of a police detective over so many years showing all of the difficulties she faced and seeing it take its toll mentally and physically was incredible.

The writing, casting, realism, production, etc. is all top notch but Mirren's performance in each episode is what gave the series its longevity.  The finale seemed to tell it all but still left me wanting more.",1397952000,,485,4.75
2857450,5,B000R349HU,Helen Mirren once again excellent in the last of this fine series. Her character remains strong and it's always a pleasure watching Mirren in a strong role which suits her perfectly.,1397952000,,182,4.903225806451613
2857451,5,B000R349HU,"Helen Mirren has always been a favorite of mine, but I had no idea this show existed.  It is excellent.  A brave and real portrayal of the issues around aging in a job, and in the tough job she has.  Really worth the time to watch.",1397779200,,231,3.9782608695652173

2857453,5,B000R349HU,The final season was excellent. Helen Mirren's portrayal of the soon to retire Jane Tennyson who is besieged by her own demons was well done.  Even after all these years I found relevance in the story line.,1397433600,,206,4.5675675675675675

2857456,5,B000R349HU,"Helen Mirren is simply the best.  What a treasure to see someone whose face is not plumped, botoxed or lifted into oblivion, but who is acting her age, with all its wanderings and self-examinations.  I love her walk into dignity in the final scene.  It is a perfect ending.  Even if you don't see the entire series, do watch The Final Act, Parts 1 and 2 from season 7.  I'm hooked.",1396569600,,381,4.309859154929577
2857457,5,B000R349HU,Before she was super famous she made this series. You really need to watch the very first one and move up from there.  It starts from about 1994- 2006,1395705600,,150,4.172413793103448

2857470,5,B000R349HU,Since watching all of the Prime Suspect series I find watching most American made TV unsatisfactory. The writing and the acting for the entire PS series is extraordinary. Jane is a character with depth and complexity you will seldom find. I can't recommend this enough. Watch it!,1394928000,,279,4.957446808510638

2857473,5,B000R349HU,"Helen Mirren's acting, the complex and yet clearly laid out plot and the convincing creation of the atmosphere in the station make this fascinating. It is a variation on a typical theme in which the protagonist cop faces the tension of crime solving along with political and personal antagonism from above and below. And she is quite imperfect with her vaulting ambition and sometimes inappropriate lust.
 I was disappointed when it ended. Unfortunately by the time I reached the final episode 7/2, Amazon streaming failed for us. I was so frustrated, I bought it to download ( although it is free to stream for Prime customers) which shows you how riveted I was.",1394236800,,663,4.867256637168142
2857474,5,B000R349HU,Helen Mirren is so good in this very real account of police life.  Of course Netflix did not have the last season Amazon filled the gap.  This series shows what really goes on behind good police work.,1393891200,,200,4.378378378378378
2857475,5,B000R349HU,"I really enjoyed this series!  Dame Helen Mirren rocks!  What a pioneer!  I would say that this is similar to people who really work these types of jobs- very difficult to do this type of work and then go home to a family.  My family is from England, we came to the USA when I was 14 so I really enjoy the British versions and it is interesting to compare to American shows that I see.  Really enjoyed it!",1393718400,,405,4.075949367088608

2857489,5,B000R349HU,"I'm a big Helen Mirren fan so I like just about anything she's in. I didn't see any of the previous Prime Suspect series, but if they were as good as the last two I would  have enjoyed them. Is it my imagination or are British detective series more well done than  American? There was drama, but it was tasteful and wasn't what I call the cooker-cutter style of  American detective series. Helen Mirren's character was completely honest. Even though she was a flawed person, she was real and did her job well. The teen actors were outstanding and the story line was convincing. There was a little violence, but it wasn't gratuitous so I wasn't as offended as I am by some American shows.",1392336000,,687,4.48

2857492,3,B000R349HU,"She plays a character that is very good at her job but not very good with relationships in her personal life.  I found myself watching someone that made some very bad choices and at times, I didn't like very much.  There is lots of personal relationship drama but not much action.  You keep hoping she'll make better choices which, it seems, in the end she finally does.",1390867200,,370,4.492537313432836

2857494,5,B000R349HU,"the beauty of amazon streaming is that it includes whole series/seasons of shows which i've only seen in parts because of work or travel conflicts.  this series, as well as the others of 'prime suspect' have held up to the passage of time because it's well-written, intelligently plotted, engagingly paced, and superbly acted by helen mirren and her support cast.  the end product is a believable telling of the human condition within the struggle between good and evil.",1389830400,,470,5.012820512820513
2857495,5,B000R349HU,The different seasons were varied and made it quite interesting. I enjoyed the whole series and recommend it to everyone.,1389830400,,121,5.1
2857496,5,B000R349HU,"This, the final of the Prime Suspect series, has DS Jane Tennison nearing retirement, dealing with her fathers failing health, and spending too much time drinking rather than eating. Helen Mirrens performance is superb. Her Tennison is tired, alone and shuttered (she doesnt want a retirement party because, well, that would be a bit much, now wouldnt it?).

The case in this two-parter is that of a murdered school girl. Tennison heads the police team investigating the murder, which leads to interactions with cynical teenagers, ineffectual parents and something rotten at school. It also brings Jane into contact with Penny, the murdered girls friend, who reminds Tennison of herself at that age. In the end Jane is left with only herself and a chance at a quiet life in retirement.

Mirrens performance drives the story. Over the fifteen or so years between the original Prime Suspect mini-series and this final one, her portrayal of an ambitious, lonely, police-smart, emotionally-stunted woman is compelling. You may not like Jane Tennison much, but its impossible not to appreciate the talented Mirrens uncompromising portrait of her.",1389830400,,1141,5.263736263736264

2857498,2,B000R349HU,"It started off looking like a reasonably good series with excellent acting, but before long two major drawbacks reared their ugly heads.  First, no captions were available, and they are essential in watching BBC dramas.  Second, the Lord's name is freely and frequently taken in vain, and that is a serious no-no for conservative Christians,  So one half of the first episode is all we could take before promptly deleting all the rest.",1388966400,,435,4.931506849315069
2857499,5,B000R349HU,"""Prime Suspect"" is captivating, interesting and, in my opinion, depicts real life today as to how a job like this can take over one's life.

The regular supporting cast and guest actors are also excellent; story lines are well written and believable. Suffice to say as watched the final few minutes of the last episode of Season 7, I felt a pang of grief as I knew I was leaving these characters - that it was over.

2857570,5,B000R349HU,"As someone who dislikes contemporary television, it takes a lot to turn my head around. HBO has been, perhaps, the most successful at doing so, and THE WIRE remained the most resonant, beautifully written and produced mini-series I'd seen on the tube -- until PRIME SUSPECT hit the airwaves more than a decade ago.

With each successive episode Helen Mirren's performances became more sensitive, her accurate portrayal of a gifted individual in crisis more acute.  The scripts and pacing were increasingly more suspenseful and the pacing spot-on.

To be frank, I've never seen a mini-series episode which matches the caliber of PRIME SUSPECT 7, the final installment of this morally urgent series. The plotting and script of this three-hour study of a detective's decline and redemption, and the resolution of a crime which has become commonplace in American society -- is brilliant. Helen Mirren's portrayal of Jane Tennison has never been more fully alive, nor her struggles with her family, career and drink, more visceral.

Of the seven installments of prime suspect, each parsed into two 90-minute chapters, this installment is nearly perfect, the suspense nearly unbearable, the urge to view again almost mandatory. This is not a video to rent, but one to buy.  It is one you will want to share with significant friends in your life because of the moral and ethical issues it taps so beautifully.

Everyone associated with the production deserves praise, and Helen Mirren surely emerges here as one of the finest actresses of her generation.

Devoid of make-up, hair askew , DS Jane Tennison reaches the depth of despair. She is drinking so much she has blackouts and cannot remember the nights before. She has entered the final stage of her career before retirement, and the final stages of alcoholism. Will one or both of them drag her down? She goes to AA and sees her old protagonist, DI Otley, the cop who went bad, played by James Bell. This is his finest performance, and they strike up a friendship. Otley becomes her mentor in AA. Jane's father becomes quite ill and dies. Old family wounds reopen, and Jane falls further down the alcohol hole. The case she is involved with is very complex, a young woman, 14, is murdered. Many people are considered suspects,and Jane is at her best and her worst.

Jane is retiring and she has no idea what will fill her life. Her life has been her job, and now that is gone. We can only surmise what will come. I would like to think Jane continues with AA and meets a man who fulfills her needs and she lives happily ever after.
Is there a happy ending for Jane Tennison, who knows, but she deserves one.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-04-12

2857601,5,B000R349HU,"Everyone who's spoken so highly has covered the substance and style of Prime Suspect which in toto is probably a defining series of what television drama can be and should be. If you haven't seen it, you should if you can reconcile yourself to there being so few of these gems and then no more. What you can count on is that the creative structure that gave rise to remarkable television such as this is still intact, despite the worst Murdoch could do.

Some notes about that. A series? Really?  Well, yes it is, but look at the span of years that it took to complete. The way PBS did it, the series carried over a period of weeks that didn't really quite add up when you considered the actual length.

The shortest season was two episodes. The longest season was three episodes. Most Seasons were two parters, including this seventh season, that add up to about four hours. The three episode seasons were no less strong, but could be more episodic.

There are  rare breaks that you might associate with station ID periods, but there is not that constant drumbeat of building in dramatic pauses for the endless stream of commercials. The typical American 1 hour show is 46 minutes of program and 14 minutes of commercials, etc. That's a bare 3.28 minutes of program for each minute of commercial.

So much for how government can't do it anything. That's what the BBC is. If it's done right, a lot of good things can happen.",1315958400,,1424,4.54296875

Prime Suspect's writing team has so-wisely freed Jane from the all too prevalent need for female characters to be forever young and has allowed Jane to age less than gracefully.  The previous seasons of Prime Suspect have seen Jane sowing the seeds of her own destructive habits as a sideline to the mysteries she's solving; this final episode batters Jane with the inevitable loneliness, alienation and pain she's pushed away for so many years.

Thanks to Mirren and the great writing, Jane does not crumple into politically correct pathos.  She remains a smart, headstrong, tough woman who is forced, very much against her will, to cope with the fallout of a life spent subjugating the personal to the professional.  The story is good, the acting is better and the writing is a wonder.  If you have not seen the previous seasons of Prime Suspect, you'll ruin the series for yourself if you watch this one first.

This episode does a good job of illustrating Tennisons' weaknesses and strengths,and faces her demons, both outward and inward.

I also liked that Jane's career started with Bill Otley(sp?) and ends with him, basically, taking a bullet for her.  That made sense; despite their conflicts, he was that kind of cop. (I believe the actor playing was dying even then, but I may be wrong on that.) What I did NOT like was Mirren (and as I understand it, she had a signifigant say in the storyline) and the writers deciding to make Jane an alcoholic; further, one so out of control she shows up at work and around interviewees drunk!  Why is it when a successful, once ambitious, single woman decides to retire, she has to have SOME addiction????? It's a cliche I am heartily sick of!  I also felt the general storyline--in terms of the crime involved, I mean--was not nearly as interesting as Marlowe in Prime Suspect 1 or the Prime Suspect about the child pedophile ring (the one with Cieran Hinds as Edward Parker Jones).",1247270400,5,1186,4.412844036697248

The Final Act is filled with the unexpected plot turns and introduces interesting complex characters. Prime Suspect 7 was dedicated to the memory of Tom Bell (Otley) who returned as Sergeant Bill Otley and who died two weeks before the episode was screened.

You could see her struggle with the choice she had made.,1486598400,,259,4.777777777777778
