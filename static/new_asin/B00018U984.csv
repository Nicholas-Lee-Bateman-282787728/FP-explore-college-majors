1977552,4,B00018U984,"The opening to the movie of a beautiful bride expecting her love to return home from WW2 only to lose him is enough to move one to tears.

Was Travis the descendent of Mary? the sister.

Poor Travis, he sure picked a lemon.  But I did enjoy her exposure of selfishness.  Only now he has lost Zoey.

Then his car is stolen with the ""Dress"" in it.  Only to make an impression on the thief's girl-friend and him.

How does the Doctor's fiancee find the ""Dress""?  Which leads to the couples sacrifices for each other.  Ow! and the coffee spill.  I was glad that the crook that the ""Dress"" got sold to did not enjoy any benefits from the ""Dress's"" blessing.

Then the ""Dress"" gets mixed up in the donations to the hospital charity through the original theif - and Madeline finds out that her husband is a crock. The turkey comes back and messes up relationship with her hunk.  She is a landscape artist who finds love with this very attractive hunk.

By the time Joan [Tyne Daly] gets the dress [it was intended for a costume company] and paints it, it has been remodeled.  Yet she finds love with a fueding next door neighbor. Wonderfully touching!

Then Joan's daughter shows up - Yup! it is Zoey [where has she been?]  As luck would have it, she remembers the original dress and restores it to its former beauty.  And returns it to Travis -- What a lovely round about way the ""Dress"" has influenced the other couples.

Definitely a girly-movie with many instances of happily ever-after that we all wish for.

Definitely Recommended -- great character actors and sub-plots - very satisfying!",1110153600,54,1588,4.5477031802120145
1977553,5,B00018U984,"OK, admittedly, it's probably pretty lame to sit around wishing and hoping that certain movies make it to DVD, but I've been doing just that since seeing this movie for the first time almost 3 years ago on CBS and then again last year on Lifetime!

This movie was such a pleasant surprise!  I'm not a hardcore fan of romances (preferring romantic comedies--and even then, very seldom), but I am a Neil Patrick Harris fan so this movie caught my eye.  I was practically on the edge of my seat with the ""will he? won't he?"" moments.  I laughed. I cried.  It was great!
This movie has something for just about everyone, but I think it's a real delight for the hopeless (or hopeful?) romantics out there!  It's a well told collection of interwoven love stories.  Nothing heavy or anything, just a really sweet treat.",1073520000,46,812,4.558620689655172
1977554,4,B00018U984,"Although I expected a typical romantic comedy, I was surprised to find interesting subplots and subjects of real content. Neil Patrick Harris is growing as an actor and has chances to show a good range for his character. I enjoyed the DVD and would share it for a ""girls-only"" night or even with my fellow since it has some story lines that are not sterotypical for a romance.",1073174400,19,376,4.544117647058823

1977677,5,B00018U984,"Who would think following the owners of a wedding dress could be entertaining?  Neil Patrick Harris shines as one of the characters that receives the gift of the dress (not for him), a family heirloom for his intended bride to wear at their wedding. Tyne Daly and her real life daughter, Kathryne Dora Brown, create a lovely story, Zoey as the lovestruck employee of Neil Patrick Harris, and her artistic mother. There are vignettes for each of the characters and how the dress is received and treated.  Would I lie about something like this?  The dress is a character on its own and each story, a sweet tale of tradition versus change.",1398816000,,636,4.660714285714286
1977678,5,B00018U984,"This story is about a wedding dress that gets stolen, changes from hand to hand and unexpectedly returns to its owner. The dress connects a series of short love stories. Sounds soppy? It's actually rather thrilling and funny. All actors were well-chosen and visibly enjoy their parts. Particularly Peter Wingfield is brilliant (no, I won't spoil your fun. Just see for yourself!)
The perfect movie for a rainy afternoon, a romantic evening, a teenager sleepover party or a wedding anniversary. And for Valentine's day, of course :)",1392508800,,531,5.114942528735632

The characters in the movie the way it advances from the first bride to be that wears it to the last bride is truly magical. Funny how a little movie like this one takes you away to a time way back when,and relates to modern times and brings a little magic where ever it travels.

1977787,5,B00018U984,"I very much like movies with a circular theme - meaning that things are interconnected and where we start is where we return.  'Il Mare', '12 Monkeys', 'The Very Thought of You' and many others use this theme.  'The Wedding Dress' is no different.

In this movie, we take a humorous journey along with none other than a wedding dress.  It begins in the hands of Hannah, who makes it with loving care for her wedding to a soldier fighting abroad.  When he dies, the dress is boxed up and a blessing bestowed on it, that it might be worn when someone she loves finds their true soul mate.

Fast forward several decades.  Her great-nephew is a photographer whose assistant has always loved him, and now he's announced his engagement to a model.  The dress is pulled from the attic at Aunt Hannah's house and sent to the city for the occassion, and makes its way from thief to taxi driver to waitress to dry cleaner to benefit auction to painter and back into the hands of the grand-nephew, while bringing love and joy and happiness to everyone whose path it crosses.  Be prepared for SIX love stories interwoven in ways that will take you by surprise.

1977842,5,B00018U984,"I just loved this charming and special, clean movie! If you are a hopeless romantic, and love happy endings, then this movie is just for you! It is about this very beautiful old wedding dress that seems to bring people together, in the most amazing ways!

 This wedding dress belonged to a very beautiful WWII bride to be.  After this beautiful wedding dress is tucked away in a old trunk for safe keeping; the heartbroken bride to be makes a sincere  wish that whomever wore the dress would be blessed with true love. When Travis's Aunt Hannah learns that Travis is getting married, she mails him this very special wedding dress for Travis's bride to be!
 When Travis's truck gets stolen with the wedding dress inside it, this wedding dress then goes on a remarkable journey, and alot of amazing things start happening to the people that comes into contact with this dress.

The dress gets SOLDED, and a woman ALMOST gets married in it! Then another woman gets CHOSEN in a bridal auction charity event, and then the wedding dress ends up somehow in a BOX of RAGS, and it then inspires a artist to PAINT it! Then it makes a man JEALOUS over his next door neighbor; who has a beautiful daughter, who also has a amazing CONNECTION to the dress! This dress INDIRECTLY helps a young man named Billy TURN his life around for pretty Lou Lou, the love of his life!
As you watch the movie you will love learning how all these people are connected to each other in amazing ways, and how they are also connected to this wedding dress.

 And my favorite love story is the one about DEKE who tolded his special next door neighbor ,to kiss his rusty butt! I highly recommend this movie! I enjoyed it very much! This movie will give you the warm fuzzies, and it will make you smile!",1253059200,3,1768,4.468944099378882

I watch this one again and again ... Definitely a ""chick flick,"" but completely enjoyable.",1246665600,,253,4.906976744186046
1977844,5,B00018U984,"This is not a guy movie, unless you are a sensitive guy. Take some advice, guys you want to be that sensitive guy that cries when watching a film like this. The sensitive guy gets the girl. The bad guy loses, the bad girl loses and everything ends up roses for those who are ""really in love"".

""The Wedding dress"" is one of those 'happy' tears films that comes along once in a while and makes a lasting impression. It is a sad film, a happy film and most of all a wonderfully written film that takes the road less travelled by and in this film that makes all the difference.

The wedding dress was sewn by a woman in love, so much in love, that when her soldier beau was killed at war, she never got to wear her dress. The dress was willed to two people who are in love as she was before the event that destroyed her own wedding. The wedding dress takes on a character of it's own causing bumps and bruises as well as lasting relationships along the way. This is a well crafted film that is well acted and beautifully filmed. Included are a few stars like Tyne Daly who you may remember from the TV show ""Cagney and Lacey"". Neil Patrick Harris and Margaret Colin. The film does not boast a blockbuster cast but the ensemble work and the chemistry between characters is top notch. I don't want to give away too much story line but this is a well woven film that had me booing the bad guys and routing for the underdogs. I enjoyed following the story although there were times I wondered where the story was going. Eventually all is revealed and I was left with an uplifting note. No bullets, no special effects, just good acting, good writing, and a wonderful soundtrack. If I said I didn't like The Wedding Dress she would divorce me.... Just kidding.  GUYS ...BUY THIS ONE...give it to her for the anniversary... it is inexpensive and well worth watching.....SG",1245628800,,1862,4.375722543352601

1977847,5,B00018U984,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise - it was much better than i thought it would be. it revolves around a wedding dress ( that was made with love but was never worn by the original owner , because her fiance was killed before they could be married, and the different people that came in touch with it- whose lives it impacted.  Although a ""little"" sad in the beginning, it's overall a funny lighthearted movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
  Personally the aura i got from the movie, is a time when life was much simpler than it is today and definitely more innocent - although each person the dress came in contact with had their own personal problems. A must see.

1977887,2,B00018U984,"This was a clever idea for a movie: the trail of lives touched by a wedding dress.  Unfortunately, in the screenwriter's apparent desire to put as many unexpected, even quirky, turns in the story as possible, he forgot that a story is supposed to be appealing.  A few moments were.  Most were either routine daytime soap-opera material or just boring.

Also, the casting was incredible.  It's as though someone tried to win the prize for who could cast the largest number of unappealing actors and actresses in a single movie.  There were one or two exceptions, like Margaret Colin, but the other eight or ten--or however many there were--ranged from off-putting to repulsive.

Apparently, a number of people liked this movie, so maybe you will too.  I don't really understand why.  I like a good human-interest story.  Unfortunately, this was not one.",1156204800,3,852,4.936619718309859

8008042,5,B00018U984,"This is a quick review for the Korean 2010 movie ""Wedding Dress"" not the US Movie ""THE Wedding Dress"" starring Neil Patrick Harris et al. For some reason Amazon is showing the latter's comments on the Korea Movies comments section.
Firstly, Korean language with accurate subtitles in English.
The story revolves around a single young woman and her estranged daughter. Suddenly the mother starts changing her life to include her daughter, which we later find out is due to her having discovered she has cancer. She cuts back her time at work, goes on trips and learns to listen to her daughter (we also discover part of this gap might be due to her having been widowed). Many subtle and not so subtle issues common in Korean culture surface as she becomes sicker such as the interplay between her sister and sister-in-law and the meaning of blood family vs in-law family.  Subplots involve the selfish boss, kimbap, the taekwondo and ballet instructors, and of course the dress and a yellow umbrella. But in the end, the story solidly resolves around the central themes of the mother and daughter learning who each other are, learning to both love each other and how to express it while both trying to come to terms with what will happen next in a world were time cannot be turned backwards and passes regardless.
Although predictable (in a Hallmark kind of way) still left me feeling sad (understatement). The daughters acting and smart attitude really made the movie work.",1508889600,,1473,4.822134387351778
