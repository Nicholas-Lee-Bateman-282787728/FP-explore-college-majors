833516,4,6304237677,"The Seventh Dawn, 1963 film

This Hollywood drama about personal conflicts uses the war for Malay independence in the 1950s as the background. Great Britain fought to keep control of this colony against those who fought for freedom from imperial exploitation. The British responded with Gun Prohibition and a death penalty for unlicenced firearms possession (as in Nazi-occupied Europe). Those who supported the fight for liberation would see their homes and villages destroyed (see Lidice, Ouradour). The British won this war, and established a neo-colonial regime that cooperated with the former Colonialists. One reason for this victory was the racial divisions of Malaya. Most support for this war for independence came from a racial minority, the Malay majority did not have this same level of political activity.

The techniques of destroying villages and resettling their people into concentration camps was blindly copied in South Vietnam. But it failed to work because the people were more united against foreign exploitation. The First Indochina War showed that colonialism could be defeated by a popular army that had no airplanes or tanks. The Dutch lost a similar war due to the unity of their subjects after the Japanese invaded and occupied this part of Indonesia.

The struggle is personified with an American plantation owner (presented as amoral and grasping), his teacher girlfriend (who is expendable in a romantic triangle), another love interest (the daughter of a politically important official), various colonial military and civil officials, and a former ally in the War against the Japanese (the insurgent leader). Can a popular figure be framed for a crime and then executed as an example? Will a heroic effort save her at the last minute? Would a moral person choose death before dishonor? Will the good guys win at the end? This is a good intellectual drama with action, but not a great success. It reminds me of a more philosophical film, ""The Quiet American"".",1288396800,,1990,5.2125
833517,4,6304237677,This movie is does a good job of showing not only the drama but the historical themes of that time. Good acting and an intelligent script. I wish it was on DVD.,1220572800,,160,4.03125
833518,5,6304237677,"I highly recommend this movie to all those who are interested in the Malayan (now Malaysia) Emergency (l948-1960). The Malayan Emergency begins with the killing of several British planters by the Communist guerillas in Sungei Siput, Perak State of the then Malaya. The actual leader of the guerillas is none other than Chin Peng (see his memoirs Chin Peng: My Side of History). But in the film he is known as Ng. This l963 movie is based on the book, THE DURIAN TREE by British writer, Michael Keon. I was an eye-witness to  several parts of the film being made in Malaysia. The beginning scene with the helicopter was filmed at the Forest Research Institue of Malaysia at Kepong. The next scene was also filmed in the grounds of FRIM at Bukit Laggong. Others scenes were filmed at the placid Lake Gardens, The Railway Station and the Moorish style Clock Tower Complex in Kuala Lumpur. The beach scene was filmed at Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan state. The various jungle scenes were filmed at Ulu Gombak on the Main Mountain Range of the country. Those were lush virgin rainforest being photographed. The jail scene was made at the famous Pudu Jail where Capucine was incarcerated for the hand geranade in her durain fruit. The rubber estate and rubber tappers at work were filmed on the Kuala Lumpur trunk road to Negri Sembilan.  The entire picture was made entirely in Malaysia and within 30 miles of the scenic Kuala Lumpur.  But, when the film was finally made and ready to show on the screen, the conservative Malay Government of the late Tunku Abdul Rahman banned it from being seen by Malaysians who might not know the truth of their country's Emergency which involved the guerillas (former anti-Japanese fighters)and the British colonialists. The colonialists  promised independence to all Malayans after the Second World War, but broke the promise when they defeated the Jap invaders together with those heoric jungle fighters who bore the brunt of the barbaric invaders! This film is still  highly sensitive today in Malaysia which is dominated by the Malay politicians. Though the hero of this story Chin Peng (Ng in the movie)and his five thousand troops had  signed a peace treaty between the Malaysian and Thai government in the l980s. Yet  Chin Peng and most of his freedom fighters (against the Jap invaders) were still not allow to visit the country for purely negative political reasons. This is a very good movie and there is some truth in what it is being portrayed. I like the main character William Holden.  I therefore leave this to the imagination of the viewers. As the truth will set one free! Have fun.",1122076800,66,2630,4.828888888888889
833519,5,6304237677,Holden is in top form as a reluctant hero (as he is in so many of his adventure films) and fits the role perfectly. Supporting cast is an added bonus. Well worth viewing for an unusual setting and conflict between the British and the communist forces led by a former war buddy of Holden's. Good stuff for a Saturday night.,1102464000,7,322,4.383333333333334
833520,4,6304237677,"Better than average adventure/drama and romantic triangle involving an American rubber plantation owner, Malay school teacher turned political activist and the daughter of a British diplomat.  Lots of beautiful scenery  showing the plantation and jungle.  William Holden fans and those who like  stories/films that take place in exotic locales will enjoy it.  Although  Capucine did an admirable job as the Malay school teacher, I've always  found it distracting to use a European or American actress to play the part  of an Asian - when there are so many extremely talented and beautiful Asian  women.  But alas, this was filmed in the early 60s, before we  ""discovered"" that the best person to play the role of an Asian is  an ASIAN!  That's just a personal complaint of mine for all movies that did  this and not a slam on this particular movie.  As I mentioned, Capucine  does a very convincing job and if you can convince yourself that she's  perhaps Eurasian, then you're home free.  I had seen the movie a couple  times (theater, TV) and found it interesting enough to buy it on VHS, so  that every few years we can slilp it into the VCR for another viewing. If  you like movies like: The Year of Living Dangerously; Elephant Walk; The  Naked Jungle; The Emerald Forest;  - you'll enjoy this film.",948672000,25,1304,4.774774774774775

833693,1,6304237677,Why this movie comes up when you look up Dark of the Sun is a mystery. The first hour of this two hour film is melodrama and not very good melodrama at that. William Holden is too old for this role... which is especially evident at the start of the film which is supposed to set up the rest of the movie with some sort of ill defined love triangle that isn't a love triangle or something. Susana York is horrible... like Hailee Mills without the talent or the charm.... and certainly not age appropriate as a love interest for Holden. Cappucine looks horrible in this - I am not certain if she is made up to look Malaysian or is she ran into a brick wall. Surely there are Malaysian actresses they could have recruited for this role... either way Cappucine isn't good in this as the civil rights leader and woman of the people..... the second half of this film is a lot of characters I don't care about running around the jungle in supposed action scenes....

This movie has action and plots within plots. To go into the storyline detail would probalbly destroy the flow, if you are a William Holden fan you will probably enjoy I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance.

833909,4,6304237677,"This movie, set in post-WWII Malaya, is a great war film. It starts with the leaders of a guerilla band in the jungle, executing Japanese prisoners, when they find out that the Pacific War is over. Ing, a Chinese native, is the leader of the band. Holden plays an American who was left behind by the Australians when they pulled out in 1941 to cause trouble for the Japanese. And Capucine plays, I don't know, the beautiful commissar of the unit? In any case, the three of them are seperated following the end of the war and the return of the British: Ing goes to Moscow, presumably to the Lenin School to learn how to stir up trouble in his native country, Holden becomes a rich landowner and Capucine the head of the teacher's union in Malaya (I KNEW she was a commissar!).

The story develops as the British, who intend to give Malaya its freedom, are faced with an insurgency which threatens to pull Malaya apart along racial lines, leaving the communists in control. Ing is in charge of the insurgency and Holden is asked to intervene on behalf of the British.

The movie has adventure, intrigue, drama and lot of communists biting the dust. I couldn't get enough of it!",1381795200,2,1175,4.537735849056604
834042,5,6304237677,"-- Spoiler Alert --

Actually, as a history lesson this movie is right on.  It's drama, but if there were a genre called ""Political Drama"" this movie would certainly qualify for it.

It's the end of World War II, and the world had ridden itself of the Nazi threat of world enslavement, the Japanese threat of world enslavement, and the power vacuum was filled with British Imperialism on one hand and Communist plots for world domination and ultimate enslavement on the other.

Caught in the middle are our protagonists Ferris, Dhana, Candace and Ng.  Ng goes off to Moscow to be indoctrinated and comes back as adversary and antagonist ready to lead his people into Communist total control (for their own good, naturally) and employs the usual methods of murder, misinformation, and terrorism to achieve his ends.

Dhana seems the most conflicted of the three and can't make up her mind about who is on the side of right and who is wrong.  She grieves at the burning of an ""innocent"" village that was harboring a cache of terrorist munitions, and goes to her death in order to shield Ng (who was ruthless enough to frame this woman he ""loved"" with concealed grenades).

But, wait.  In true British stoic pragmatism the authorities are willing to free Dhana from her hanging sentence if only she will give up Ng and help them find him.  I guess one could argue that the British presence was the lesser of the two evils, but then as Ng would say, this was war, and war has its casualties.  No biggie.

Ultimately it's up to Ferris to bring Ng back in order to save the woman he loves, and ends up having to kill him on the way back.  But then the British official who had promised the pardon for Dhana had been himself murdered by terrorists, so there was no loss that Ng had met his deserved fate on the way back to save the woman he had framed.

In the end, nobody wins.  Ferris will grieve and mourn the woman he loved until he dies.  There is no room in his heart for Candace, who had grown up from her puppy love for Ferris into a self-sacrificing woman of principle, but nevertheless was still no replacement for Dhana.

Well, perhaps the country wins.  Eventually....",1381622400,2,2173,4.528205128205128

834046,5,6304237677,"""The Seventh Dawn"" was made during the early years of the Vietnam conflict.  The story is set and the movie is filmed in Malaysia, a beautiful country then and now.  The scenery alone justifies the price of the DVD.  Had this been an American film, it might have been criticized for not addressing burgeoning anti-Vietnam War sentiments and focusing on the attempts of the British Empire to peacefully ""de-imperialize.""  Instead, since this is a British production, it comes across as a self-critical analysis of how western Europeans often dealt with culture confrontation - many times honorably; often not so honorably.

The story opens on an optimistic note with the ending of WW2.  The three main characters have been comrades-in-arms who anticipate a bright future.  Ferris, played by William Holden, is the owner of a rubber plantation who goes on to acquire more land to add to his ""empire.""  Capucine is cast in the role of Dhana, a beautiful Eurasian who becomes the leader of the Teachers' union.  Tetsuro Tamba portrays Ng, a guerrilla fighter who goes to Moscow to receive more education - read ""become more firmly indoctrinated.""  When he asks Dhana to go as his bride, she declines and stays with Ferris.

Eight years later, Ng returns to speed up the orderly withdrawal of the British and hasten in a Marxist regime.  Since the British have subjects with interests in Malaysia, they naturally wish to de-imperialize more gradually.  Governor Trumphey, played by Michael Goodliffe, is attempting to be fair yet firm.  He grants concessions to the native Malaysians by rescinding a ban on bicycles, but then he makes an unpopular move by burning a village suspected of storing arms for the guerrilla fighters.  It doesn't help the imperialist cause when his suspicions turn out to be well-founded.

Dhana, upset with British harshness, momentarily agrees to help Ng's cause.  Shortly thereafter, a search of the contents of Dhana's bicycle reveals that grenades have been secreted.  Dhana is tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging - unless she will betray Ng, which she refuses to do.

Susannah York in the role of Candace Trumphey, the governor's ""vixenish"" yet idealistic daughter, believes in Dhana's innocence and throws a monkey wrench into the works by deciding to offer herself as a hostage to Ng.  Ferris sets out to find Ng in hopes of persuading him to return with him, prove Dhana's innocence, and allow the governor's daughter to go free.  He has 7 days to accomplish this task; therefore, the title, ""The Seventh Dawn.""  Heart-stopping action accompanies Ferris's quest to save both Dhana and Candace and thwart Ng's primary motive, to bring Malaysia under a Marxist regime even at the sacrifice of the innocent, including the woman he loves.

The Laotian general, Kong Li, quipped, ""When two elephants fight,"" - in this case the ""elephants"" being the western versus Marxist ideals - ""it is the grass which suffers.""  This could be applied not only to Laos, but all of Indochina, of which Malaysia is a part.",1370822400,5,3050,4.994059405940594

834048,5,6304237677,"1958's The Quiet American and 1963's The Ugly American both tried to shed some light on the hazards of foreign involvement in Vietnam but 1964's The Seventh Dawn proved the most realistic of the 3 films. William Holden is an American veteran who fought with locals against the Japanese in WW II and becomes an expatiate by staying in Malaya and farming.
He does well, complete with Capucine as his native love interest. When the ruling British can't contain Communist rebels, Holden is unwillingly drawn into the conflict in an attempt to save his woman against all odds.
While the ugly American and quiet American were at best dopes or dupes (especially in the 2002 remake of The Quiet American)  The Seventh Dawn presents a no-nonsense hero driven by loyalty to those closest to him, even former allies who are now enemies.

834049,4,6304237677,"Set in the post-war Malayan Emergency and filmed entirely on location this is a very rare beast indeed.  I got it from Amazon as a bundle with The Sands of the Kalahari and sat down one afternoon to watch it with entirely neutral, open expectations (apart from those relating to the gorgeous Susannah York).

This DVD is of good quality although some loss of colour and contrast is present.

What I liked:
1. Excellent location photography - this was superb: think of an action travelogue of Malaya in 1964.
2. Heaps and heaps of fantastic classic cars - a pity they had to destroy a Riley but at least the Rover wasn't really shot up (at least I hope it wasn't)!
3. A Gloster Meteor jet and Dragonfly(??)helicopter.
4. Really cool British colonial and Australian police and army extras.
5. Excellent acting from the British cast: Cuthbertson is a fantastically good scene stealer and the guys who play Champey the High Commissioner and the Police Chief are the best of the lot.
6. Did I say Susannah York? She tries hard and does the best she can with the lines she was given.  When the head terrorist ""searches"" her for weapons it actually looks like he ad-libbed it and caught her completely by surprise - marvellous!
7. Big budget (for the day) action scenes: the raid on the terrorist camp stands out.  The dinner dance scenes at the British Residency also sticks in my mind in a positive way.
8. The sensitive and accurate portrayal of British official policy as regards Malayan independence - bravo - a contemporary Mel Gibson evidently and thankfully never got near the shooting script.

What made me cringe:
1. William Holden - really what was the hype about with this guy?  His performance in this movie is frankly shocking: wooden, hung over, unconvincing, in need of a good lie down and generally appearing to be phoning it in in between breaks from serious work at the hotel bar. A pity; as a professional he could and should have lifted the movie.  Someone like Lee Marvin would have been a better casting choice in my opinion.
2. Holden's posited romantic relationship with York's character was, the way it was scripted, close - very, very close - to creepy.
3. Clunky unpolished 1940's scriptwriting, especially when the leads are told to get all ""deep and meaningful"". It's hard to believe this was scripted at the same time as greats like Lawrence of Arabia. Holden is also a key part of the problem here methinks.  I suspect the script was finished, the writer paid, and the whole box of words packaged up and flown out to Malaya with no wriggle room afterwards. A movie that cried out for a couple of zingingly memorable lines and scenes, but alas these are not to be found.

Overall this is a good one for the movie buffs and especially those looking for a good value-for-money purchase (it's no run of the mill, cut off by the yard 90 minute romancer-bang-bang).  Go for it and who knows: maybe you see something different from myself in Mr Holden.  But regardless, I'm sure we'll unanimously agree on the merits of Miss York!",1362268800,,3048,4.644981412639405

Dhana stays on as a teacher. Ng goes to Moscow and becomes indoctrinated into the ways of Communism only to return later to enforce Maylayan rebels who are trying to kick the Brits out of the country. Dhana is framed to look like a rebel. She won't rat out Ng so Ferris needs to find Ng and turn him in before the noose tightens.

This is a decent story decently directed. What it has going for it is the way the characters are written and performed. Holden, and Capucine are really good. Tetsuro Tanba as Ng runs close behind. Susannah York as Candace Trumpey is Okay, but this was still a bit early in her career so she's not quite up to the others. The directing is a bit on the pedestrian side. The action/fight scenes are a bit sloppy and the talk scenes needed a bit more movement in them. The crowd scenes are typical of the time as is the musical score. Those things have gotten so much better in film over the years. Decent use is made of the location in both the villages and the wilds, but overall it's a bit leaden. It also has an interesting ending and, given this was released in 1964 it was a bit ahead of its time. Holden remarks to a British diplomat how they have learned nothing in the centuries they've spent trying to colonize other countries. The U.S. would make this same mistake a few years later in Viet Nam.

This is a good solid watch. It probably won't hit your top ten but it's a good ride none the less.",1330387200,7,1798,4.2823529411764705

834143,5,6304237677,This is yet another great movie put out by William Holden.  This movie is at the quality of Bridge on the River Kwai.  Absolutely fantastic film.  There is nothing I can say about this film to discourage ANYONE from see it.,1322697600,,223,4.390243902439025
834144,5,6304237677,"Years ago I found a copy of this movie in VHS format and it's deteriorated due to the high humidity in Asia.  The story of a struggle in Malaya between WWII-time allies for the ultimate fate of Malaysia: the country that it is or a communist dominated state.  It leaves one with an appreciation of the realities of what it took to create an independent Malaysia and a hint of why there were anti-Chinese feelings for a long time in that country.
I'm glad to see it's on DVD and recommend it to anyone interested in S.E. Asian History and a step away from the classic gung-ho Viet-Nam movies about the struggles against communist domination.",1305676800,12,640,4.556521739130435
834145,2,6304237677,"First, I love William Holden; Stalag 17, Bridge on River Kwai, Bridges at Toko-Ri, are 3 excellent war films he did but this film winds up a 'stinker' in the end. Holden, Capucine, and Tetsuro Tamba, start off as best friends in Malaya battling the Japanese in WW II. But they each wind up going in very different directions after the war as the country is thrown into a battle for independence while under the violent influence of both the United Kingdom and the Communists. While the 'Red Scare' theme is now outdated, its the 'soap opera' ending that kills this film most of all. As the credits roll, William Holden drives off in his white convertable to see the world after his girlfriend is hanged by the British for terrorist activities and it just doesn't work. This is not one of those films that 'needed' to be brought out on DVD as it turns out.",1305590400,,855,4.487179487179487
834146,3,6304237677,"I had been searching for this movie for a long time. There has not been much on this subject,either print or film.
My interest in this film,is because I was in that war,from 1955to 1956,a period of 18 months. So thanks to Amazon
I was able to indulge myself. There is another film around called The Planters Wife,which is a lot more authentic
than the 7th dawn.

834147,5,6304237677,"Splendid cast and little known film that captures the turmoil of post WWII Mayala. Holden is once again perfectly cast as a man who is tired of war and wants to resume his rubber business, but old ties to the local Malayian communist leader draws him back into the violent fold of war. Filmed on location, this little seen film is excellent and finally on DVD. The only film to have British paratroopers making a jungle assault and Vampire jets zooming overhead. Cool. Check it out.",1303430400,36,482,4.616279069767442
834148,5,6304237677,"Watching a 'devil-may-care' William Holden hacking his way through the jungle is reminisent of his turn in ""River Kwai""! Here he struggles with divided loyalties among lovers, friends and politicians. With good-looking capable actors,lush exotic location photography, a haunting musical score and equal amounts of suspense,action and romance this one is a winner - lambasted by critics with no regard for the masses ""The Seventh Dawn"" remains one of my all-time ""guilty pleasures"".",1301788800,50,481,5.602739726027397

Holden delivers a strong character performance, per typical of him.  The only ""flaw"" I saw for technical aspects was the chopping through the jungle with a machete.  Having lived in Panama in the 1980s and taught in the jungle school, we never chopped through the jungle with machetes...we wove our way through the vegetation, far more quiet and far less fatiguing plus far less of a trail left behind.  It was well worth the investment i the DVD for my collection.",1491177600,,604,4.669811320754717
