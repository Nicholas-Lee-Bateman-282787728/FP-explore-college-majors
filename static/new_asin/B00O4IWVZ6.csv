You do need a multi region dvd player to watch this particular version from it's original source.

For anyone considering purchasing this series, but in the seperate season packs, I would suggest that you buy this series in its entirety. Well worth the money, with smooth Amazon delivery also.",1489276800,6,351,4.67741935483871

6710610,5,B00O4IWVZ6,"I have been waiting to view again The High Chaparral ever since I once saw the series while still a resident in Malaysia. It has been over 50 years and now I am able to buy the entire series and see John Cannon and
crew galloping across my wide screen TV, protecting his ranch empire from commandcheros, raiding apaches
and cattle rustlers. This is perhaps the Western TV series ever made and I have no hesitation to recommend it
to my friends worldwide. Cheers...!",1416355200,8,465,4.5476190476190474

8682044,5,B00O4IWVZ6,"One of the best westerns series to watch. It gives you drama, action/adventure, comedy that is great for the whole family. There are no  X-rated pornography and graphic killing to see and no cursing to hear. I was raised watching this western along with a lot more and still love to watch them.  As a matter of fact, I have purchased all the ones that I loved as a kid.",1528761600,2,369,4.257142857142857

8682048,5,B00O4IWVZ6,"As good as I remembered from the original airing on TV.

As the series and characters developed over 4 seasons, the subtle messages in every episode of diversity, inclusion, tolerance and acceptance of others remains as important and relevant message today as it did when this aired 50 years ago.  Unlike some other westerns of the 60s these characters are gritty and flawed and their individual stories continued to develop over time.",1521763200,3,435,5.027777777777778
8682049,5,B00O4IWVZ6,"I am loving revisiting the Cannons in Tucson!  For the most part the picture and the sound is great, every great while there is a glitch  - picture gets grainy or the color fades but not often.  There is no table of contents in the box or on the box so I'm having to create my own spreadsheet so I'll be able to find a specific episode more quickly next time through.  All in all, very worth the cost!",1517443200,2,401,4.037974683544304
