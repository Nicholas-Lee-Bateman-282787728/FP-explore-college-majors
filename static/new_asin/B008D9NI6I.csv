5153171,5,B008D9NI6I,"""Unzipped"" is one of my favorite documentaries.  I find Isaac Mizrahi to be such a great person to watch.  He is so creative, so verbose and so highly entertaining.  It's also interesting to see so many of the supermodels of the day.  What icons they were at the time:  Shalom Harlow, Cristy Turlington, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford (footage of then-husband Richard Gere too) and the ageless Naomi Campbell.  And, who knew Linda Evangelista was such a whiny bitch?!  At any rate, I had this on vhs, could not transfer it to dvd and when I looked online to buy the dvd - yowza!  The dvd of ""Unzipped"" is ridiculously expensive!  I mean, I checked on Ebay, on Amazon, on every other outlet I could think of.  The dvd was priced outrageously.  In addition, I also had ""Ready To Wear"" on vhs and it would not transfer either.  Although not my favorite Robert Altman film, it still had its moments and Stephen Rea's performance is off the chain!  So, imagine my surprise and delight at finding this incredibly reasonably-priced set! Three films for under $20!!!  I had never seen ""September Issue"" before receiving this and I really did enjoy watching it. Following then-editor Anna Wintour around was somewhat interesting, but what I especially loved was seeing the photo shoots and the resulting pictures that the editors chose from. Absolutely fascinating!

But for me, this set is all about ""Unzipped"" and Isaac Mizrahi.  This doc stands the test of time and so do the fashions he created for the season reflected.

This set is priced to move and guarantees to entertain!

So thrilled to find it in dvd format - with two other fun films in the bargain - and FOR a bargain!",1350432000,9,1668,4.673539518900344
5153172,5,B008D9NI6I,"I enjoyed these so much. The September Issue is really interesting and Ready to Wear is a hoot to watch! It was so funny. Unzipped shows how much a designer has to go through to make it. These movies were well worth having. I'll watch them again and again.
Shipping was fast and they arrived in perfect condition - ready for watching.",1425513600,,334,4.403225806451613
5153173,3,B008D9NI6I,"The September Issue is AMAZING.  Unzipped is interesting and worth a watch.  Ready to Wear is one of the worst movies I have seen in a LONG time.  I couldn't even finish it.  Aside from being poorly written and badly acted it was deadly dull.  If you buy this, just toss Ready to Wear into the bin straight away and enjoy the other two.",1424563200,,336,4.1875

5153175,5,B008D9NI6I,"Nostalgia... This really brings back so many fond memories. The catwalk scenes in the Isaac Mizrahi's show was iconic. The farcical treatment of Ready To Wear was flavourful and bitingly funny and no one can deny the exacerbating tension whenever Anna Wintour appears in September Vogue.

This is not a reissue with extras as this will not command a larger set of people buying but a selected bundle which will easily appeal to fashion movie fans.",1410134400,3,447,4.881578947368421
5153176,2,B008D9NI6I,Sept. Issue was wonderful.  Ready To Wear was a bad movie...lots of stars for no reason.,1405987200,2,88,4.5
5153177,3,B008D9NI6I,"I bought this hoping that Ready to Wear would have been reissued in an Anamorphic Widescreen format by this point. Unfortunately, it appears to just be the same disc that Miramax originally released in 1999. It's nice to have this Altman film at an affordable price (along with the two other films), but I wish that it had been made more useful to those of us in the HDTV era.",1398038400,4,376,4.385714285714286
5153178,5,B008D9NI6I,Fabulous!!! I've watched all three films/documentaries over and over. My love of France and fashion left me wanting more!! Thank you.,1396137600,2,133,5.380952380952381
5153179,5,B008D9NI6I,"OK, lets be fair, this is not for everyone - but if you are into fashion, and you are quite deeply interested in fashion, this is a deal of a collection you will not want to pass up. This is an easy recommendation to any fashionista. Buy it. These may even be great for the folks with general interests in life outside mainstream Hollywood. They are unique ""docudramas"" and feel more (and may be) real documentaries - especially unzipped and the Sept Issue - but with a camera on one, many tend to change.

At the time of this review the product was about $10 for 3 DVDs, do the math. It is well worth it - and the fashion keen will be happy with this purchase.",1390521600,3,661,4.2047244094488185
