8010546,1,B0001DI0BM,"While the term DVD usually refers to a movie that was produced after DVD's were invented, this one takes the cake from all the other exceptions. Obviously this video is a compilation of several VHS tapes of educational shows produced in the 1970's, put onto a DVD. Very few facts included, and your kids probably won't stop making fun of the graphics long enough to hear them anyway. Buyer Beware!",1179273600,7,397,4.685714285714286
