If you're new to The Simpsons these are two great  episodes to get you started. ""The Way We Was"" is a great  flashback to Homer and Marge's high school years, and it has become one of  the all time classic episodes. ""Homer vs. Lisa & The 8th  Commandment"" is rich in laughs and plot material. Lisa isn't the whiny  preacher she became in later seasons, and Homer makes this episode. Two of  the best ever! Buy this now!",962582400,2,594,4.385321100917431
