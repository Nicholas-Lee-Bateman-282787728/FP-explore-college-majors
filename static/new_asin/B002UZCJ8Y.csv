3993654,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"(The movie is based on a comic book of the same name. Since I have not read it, I am reviewing the film as a stand alone work)

In a not so distant future, 98% of Earth's population are using human made robots as their avatars in the real world. From their comfy homes, reclining in their comfy chairs, clad in their uber ugly pajamas, the ""meat bags"" (as the ""real"" humans are affectionately referred to) control, as well as feel, their surrogates' every move and action. They work, live, make love and war as taller, prettier, shinier versions of themselves. It is therefore surprising, that FBI Agent Greer would choose, of all available options, to have his avatar look like the aging Bruce Willis with a bad toupee... But... we willingly suspend our disbelief and pretend we do not notice... a trick that comes in handy on many more occasions during this short flick, but one that becomes more and more difficult to perform as we grow increasingly annoyed with the appearance of yet another plot hole.

The son of the genius behind the surrogate program is murdered. It is likely the genius himself, Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), was the intended victim. No one seems to remember when the last murder actually took place. Somehow, the writers want us to believe that the use of surrogates has put an end to murder... Well, not logical, but enter another suspension of disbelief. During the course of their investigation, Greer and his partner Agent Peters (the lovely Radha Mitchell whom we first saw as Fry in Pitch Black) discover the existence of a weapon that can kill not only a surrogate, but also its human owner. It is a threat to the entire civilization. Mayhem ensues as Agent Greer the ""meat bag"" must abandon his comfy chair and his ratty pj's to re-join the real world in order to save us all.

The film's message is interesting and thought provoking. It is conceivable that in a couple of decades we will be able to send avatars into war and control them with only our thoughts. How far will we take this technology? The danger has always existed that, in our never-ending quest to subjugate the Earth, we would take it too far and lose our humanity in the process... This message however is not new and has been presented in far more entertaining packages. Surrogates is not a bad film. If it were a made-for-TV, or a direct-to-DVD, I would be impressed. Given however, that this is a theatrical release with a predictable, yet swiss cheese plot, conventional CGI, and a second hand philosophy, I just cannot find reasons to rave about it. Even the acting does not inspire. Despite some great talents present (I could never forget how brilliantly creepy Cromwell was in L.A. Confidential), the underdeveloped script thwarts any attempts at talent display. If you have a couple of hours to spare, sure, it will not hurt to see Surrogates. But, if you do not, you will not miss anything. Again, it's been done already, only better.

BTW: Interesting that the makers refused to do movie critic screenings. Typically, that is a sign of low confidence in their own work. Oh, well. Maybe next time...",1253836800,5,3116,4.701465201465202
3993655,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Provided you're a fairly willing subject for the suspension of disbelief, Surrogates works, for the most part, throughout its relatively short duration. Sadly, as soon as the lights go up (even sooner if you're a firm advocate of reality) the flood of questions begin to pick the story and its prophetic premise apart. A future where technology has advanced so far that nearly everyone has sacrificed their humanity and physical interaction with virtual reality and the use of perfect human duplicates is certainly no dull setting. So why are people still driving around beat-up old cars? This query and many more weaken the innovation of the creation on display and a ""seen-it-coming-from-a-mile-away"" conspiracy angle doesn't help much either. At least in this world full of plastic humans, the majority of the actors fit right in.

In the future, computer and robotics technology has progressed so far that humans can live out their lives and fantasies through the safety of android ""surrogates"". But the supposedly risk-free robots become deadly when FBI agents Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) discover a weapon that can kill human users through their surrogates. When the son of prominent scientist and surrogate creator Lionel Canter (James Cromwell) is murdered, the two agents must track down a mysterious killer and stop a devious mastermind from executing a plan that could destroy their world forever.

It's an invasion of the inhuman, a revolution of doppelgangers, an army of body snatchers. It's like playing inside of a video game, or plugging into ""The Matrix,"" where all of the senses can be used to their fullest extent, all while the ""operator"" is in the safety of a cushy bed. But it's like ""The Island,"" ""I, Robot,"" ""The Stepford Wives,"" ""Minority Report,"" ""Terminator"" (and even ""Coraline"") and almost every science-fiction film in the last decade recklessly blended together. The idea is creepy, freaky, thought-provoking, and definitely interesting, riddled with imminent disaster, conspiracies and murder. But with a short runtime and entirely too much to define, Surrogates suffers from a neat and tidy conclusion that cheats the complexity of the setting.

Very early on, when Greer admits that every perfectly proportioned surrogate is probably just a fat guy, lounging around in a bathrobe, inappropriately exposed, it's clear that the writers aren't trying to hide the silliness of the concepts their world is based upon. Who knew that such heavy science-fiction themes could be so purposefully comical? Usually these films try incredibly hard to convince the audience that the ideas are plausible, or at the very least to suspend disbelief. The unintentional humor is usually unstoppable, but in Surrogates, at least for a few fleeting scenes, it is wholeheartedly embraced. Apparently even in a world of fake people, Bruce Willis can still keep it real.

3993667,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"Do androids dream of electric sheep? No, they dream of surrogates. This was a bizarre movie about humanity that allows itself to be replaced by androids they can live through. I've never heard of a more ridiculous and preposterous idea. It made absolutely no sense. Why would a healthy person want to even go through this unless they were doing deep sea diving or working in high radiation zones? But unless one happened to be disabled the entire premise is preposterous and ludicrous. Androids themselves make sense but not humans living through them.

Something else that did not make sense was the contemporary aspect of the film. It was too early 21st century to be believable. In order for our suspension of belief to be delivered, the setting should have been in the far, far, future not a pseudo contemporary or dystopian future. It throws off any kind of imagination we could have for the situation.

This story might have worked had George Lucas or Steven (A.I.) Spielberg done the film. However, it comes off as unrealistic and while not contrived, the script does not reach me. Two and a Half Stars rounded down. Don't buy this on DVD, see it for free on cable or your pal's Net Flix. I'm the 458th person to review this film.

It is about a cop who investigates a murder of a human being in a society where most people bought surrogates to take their place while they can stay at home in bed and enjoy what is happening vicariously. The humans can control these robots who do all the things the humans want to do or must do. It is a very pleasurable thing, except it has destroyed what humans are supposed to be.

3993709,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"This movie has its moments, but if you are tech savvy in the least, it will not sit well with you. Given the prevalence of satellite dishes in the film, one can only surmise that the controlling signal for the surrogates is by a satellite link. Assuming the use of geostationary satellites one could expect a signal propagation latency of 240ms +/-, couple that with the additional latency associated with signal processing and it becomes easy to understand why these surrogates could not do some of the things they do, like drive cars. Also, they seem to have no limitation on where they can operate, but my cellphone does not work in an elevator, and it communicates with a terrestrial tower. And then there is the problem of having so many surrogates online and operating (in real time) simultaneously, with each one engaged in a high-bandwidth full-duplex communication exchange with its operator, but yet the cellular telephone network goes down when too many people try to make a call. How much data must flow for a person to live vicariously through a robot surrogate in real-time given that the operator can feel, see, hear, talk, walk, and do everything else he or she could do in real-life? And even if they are linked to the operator though a terrestrial means, we are still asked to believe that the signal is enjoying a full bi-directional link at five-bars, even when inside of rooms that appear to be made completely of stainless steel.

Bruce Willis is able to show some of his range, and the supporting actors (including Rosamund Pike) put in strong performances.  The root notion of remotely-operated 'surrogate' bodies may not strictly serve as new territory for the scifi fan (think of James Cameron's 'Avatar,' for example), but 'Surrogates' deals with the notion in a fairly nuanced way, balancing mostly restrained performances (no over-the-top expressions until we encounter Ving Rhames in the film's closing half hour) with several strong action sequences.  The execution may be somewhat uneven, but in many ways it strikes the same notes as its scifi predecessor, 'The Island,' which also attempts to tackle certain questions about the nature of reality and our understanding of the human condition within the framework of action and adventure.

The concept is that in the future, humans will be so lazy as to send in, basically, android clones of themselves, to do their daily routine, while the real people hide out at home. The biggest selling point is that the clones can look any way you want. Disfigured or self-loathing people can give themselves great bodies and looks. It says a lot about the future of image and what it means to be a ""real"" person. And, just as many do live in faked lives today, the question comes with what happens if a wrench gets thrown into the machine, after everyone is comfortable and set in their hiding ways. What if the system stops working, and real people must venture outdoors once again to face each other as they really are. Interesting topic and conversation starter film.

3993806,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"This movie is a lot of fun. I last saw it in theaters years ago and am happy to add it to my collection (I don't often buy movies).

Most of modern society use a real life surrogate/avatar to go about their daily lives, as they control it from their home via a virtual reality type program. The avatars are plentiful and can be financed like cars. Some people choose to not to use an avatar, which is so rare that people sort of surprised when they stumble across a real human in their everyday lives.  Each human control these avatars during almost all of their waking life, unhooking during sleep/eating/bathroom breaks and can even loan a replacement, generic, avatar when their avatar is being repaired.  People who control their avatars might have one that looks just like them, or use one that can be completely different, including gender, race, or body type, or anything really. Some sort of conspiracy is stumbled upon by Willis' character, a detective, when some criminal figured out how to fry a controller's brain through the use of their avatar. Willis tries to uncover the truth and save the world and all that.

I don't remember the plot details exactly, but I look forward to watching it again and I recommend it as an entertaining movie that sort of flew under the radar at the time of it's release. Lot's of people I know have never even heard of it.",1444521600,3,1368,4.571428571428571

3993815,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Do you remember the movie where Bruce Willis played a cop?  In this one he plays a cop in the future.  In this future people hook into a sensory device that allows them to operate a robot replica of themselves, sort of the ultimate Waldo.  You don't go to work, you send your surrogate to work and operate it from home like tele-commuting.  Since no one in his right mind would choose a surrogate that looks like I do, everybody chooses an idealized robot version of themselves.  The result is that the world is filled with beautiful young people surrogates who work and party down while the human operators slouch in high tech wired up recliners.  The humans are the worse for lack of exercise and sunshine after a few years.
 There are some cool futuristic ethics involved.  Is it adultery if my surrogate is involved with another surrogate?  Remember, the surrogates are not autonomous; they must be intimately controlled by the human operator.  If one surrogate murders another, it is considered vandalism rather than a more serious crime.
 All that aside, it is an entertaining cops and bad guys thriller/action movie which satisfies at that level.  Wills shows that he can pull off a major studio film single handedly.  The special effects are muted but the surrogates are creepily realistic.  We see Bruce as he looked when he made Moonlighting 30 years ago, and his rugged today self.
 This PG 13 SiFy/cop/action flick runs a too quick 89 minutes.  It came in for the weekend with $15 million and will have to work to earn back its $80 million budget.  Three saw blades for this interesting but not outstanding or really ground breaking movie.",1440374400,,1651,4.7368421052631575

Surrogates is no exception.  Great script and I really enjoyed the movie.  Really, the plot it is just an extension of how current technology is changing the normal evolutionary lifestyle of the human species.  For millions of years our ancestors lived an active lifestyle constantly on the move in order to survive and succeed.  Now, especially with the introduction of the desk top computer, our species has all of sudden become sedentary, and the health of our species is now in jeopardy. One thing though, I wish the script would have included a scene from a 24hr fitness showing the surrogates doing exercises at the gym (treadmill, free weights, exercise bikes etc.).  Willis could have come home to his wife and caught her doing these excises at the gym with her surrogate and confronted her about it!  Add  a scene like that along with all the different pills she had on her vanity and that would have been hilarious and icing on the cake!",1417824000,,1182,4.671497584541063

3993920,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"You may not like this movie but this is one of the possible scenarios for robots in the future.  People may like Blade Runner better because of its more artful appearance and film noir, it is less likely for us to have autonomous robots.  We already are capable of remotely logging into computer systems and executing software on remote systems.  The control of robots is not far behind, if not already here - bomb sniffers, etc.  The remote controlled robots just don't look like humans and are not wide spread as depicted in this movie.

I think this movie is a good to point out to caution ourselves from letting robots take over our lives.  We are humans and need to live like humans.  I did not get any such message from Blade Runner.  The movie IRobot probably makes this point as well but is less clear because once again, the robots are autonomous, needing little to no human control.

3993936,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"I enjoyed this movie. There was not really any gore, not too much violence, and I don't remember God or Jesus being used as a curse word like in most movies now. So these things are pluses. This movie shows the negative side if surrogates were ever possible. It also could even show the negative side to people spending too much time in virtual reality worlds. It also shows what a corrupt corporation might do to protect its profits. Here are some thoughts and reactions I had while watching this movie (SPOILERS):

-At the beginning of the movie, something to this effect was said when referring to humans, comparing them to surrogates ""this is how God made you"". I thought this was interesting that it was in the movie, and wondered why, especially in the beginning. Are the writers trying to tell us to be real and appreciate life?

-Surrogates were referred to by media or historians as an ""evolutionary significance' to human activity. I find it odd that the word evolution was used for a technological advancement and not a biological change in actual human DNA.

-A media report or historian report at the beginning of the movie says that the surrogate movement pretty much eliminated crime. I find this to be unrealistic that surrogates like in this movie could nearly eliminate crime. It would probably increase crime because people would not fear being hurt. In the movie we also see those two surrogates getting ready to abuse a woman, and then the guy deactivates them to prevent the crime. So, in this world, maybe that's the only way it did reduce crime was by the total surveillance of all surrogate connections and deactivating possible connections. This puts a whole new spin to Big Brother concepts like in 1984. Also, Cantar, the inventor of surrogates does a lot of underhanded things while trying to destroy his invention. Also the lead guy in the FBI in the movie tried to get Cantar killed. So, in the end, surrogates didn't really reduce crime even in this movie it seems, despite the media claim.

-In this world, would insurance be required to operate a surrogate?

-This movie reminded me of the movie Wall-e where humans were hovering around on beds while staring at computer screens for most of their waking hours.

-VSI advertised surrogates by saying you can ""do what you want"" if you get one. As if laws don't apply any longer? you can do whatever you want? This illustrates the hypocrisy of advertisements.

-""relax, we're the good guys"" says the guy who is able to monitor every surrogate connection on the planet (or at least in the city), but yet he didn't know about the attempt to kill cantar or the FBI guy who arrange it?",1407628800,3,2662,4.6995708154506435

3993959,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Real science-fiction films are rare items.  What passes for science-fiction (flying sharks, warp drives, time machines) has no basis in reality.  It can be fun, but it's just silly fantasy.  Real science fiction holds a mirror up to our own lives and gives us worlds that feel familiar.  One of the best science fiction movies ever--Gattacca--shows us a world that could actually come to be.

'Surrogates' certainly doesn't approach 'Gattacca', but it's pretty decent science fiction.  As we move more of our own lives into computers, and represent ourselves with technology, we wrestle with what community actually means.  While the robot avatars of this film are more likely to be half a century away, they still serve as good stand-ins for the way many of us would like to be.  Bruce Willis's character is a detective who's become increasingly uneasy about this transformation.  But even he--in one of the best scenes in the movie--suffers near-crippling anxiety when he's out in the world as himself.

Of course it's a cop adventure too.  In that regard it's fairly serviceable.  But the real film is about a technological world that isn't quite working. Most of us will be long-gone before the possibility of that world.  But 'Surrogates' gives us a moment to think about the direction we're steering.",1393372800,14,1306,5.018604651162791

It is thought-provoking and sensitive - an intellectual dessert in a movie scape too often a thinking person's desert.",1373155200,,627,4.831775700934579

3993995,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"""Surrogates"" is great! This is how the story goes: People are living their lives remotely from the safety of their own homes via robotic surrogates -- sexy, physically perfect mechanical representations of themselves. It's an ideal world where crime, pain, fear and consequences don't exist. When the first murder in years jolts this utopia, FBI agent Tom Greer discovers a vast conspiracy behind the surrogate phenomenon and must abandon his own surrogate, risking his life to unravel the mystery.

The cast led by Bruce Willis (as Tom Greer) is great! The directing by Jonathan Mostow (who also directed ""Breakdown"" (1997, also wrote the screenplay and story), ""U-571"" (2000, also wrote the screenplay & story) & ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003) is great! The screenplay (based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti & Brett Weldele) by Michael Ferris & John D. Brancato (both of them wrote the story and screenplays to ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" & ""Terminator: Salvation"" (2009), they also writing the screenplay to the upcoming ""XXX: The Return Of Xander Cage"" (2011) is great!

The music by Richard Marvin (who also did the music to ""U-571"") is great! The cinematography by Oliver Wood (who also did the cinematography to ""U-571"" & The Bourne films (2002, 2004, & 2007) is great! The film editing by Kevin Stitt (who also did the film editing to ""Breakdown"" & ""Cloverfield"" (2008) & Barry Zetlin is great! The casting by Janet Hirshenson, Jane Jenkins & Michelle Lewitt (all three did the casting to ""Angels & Demons"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lighting Thief"" (2010) is great! The production design by Jeff Mann (who also did the production design to ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"", ""Transformers"" (2007) & ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008) is great! The art direction by Tom Reta (who also did the art direction to ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" (2008) & ""17 Again"" (2009) & Dan Webster (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to ""Tropic Thunder"") is great! The set decoration by Debbie Cutler, Basia Goszczynska & Fainche MacCarthy (who also did the set decoration to ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" (2007) is great! The costume design by April Ferry (who also did the costume design to ""U-571"", ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" & the upcoming ""The Box"" (2009) is great!

This is a great action-thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is better than some of Willis' recent films, with the expectation of ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007). The movie moves at a solid pace.",1369526400,,2588,4.931192660550459
3993996,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"I really liked this movie and it's plot story of the entire society using cyborgs by their owners to go about their daily activities at work and play while they stay safe at home. There is no risk of physical harm to the owners who want to do dangerous things or kinky things. That is until a one of a kind military device is stolen which can not only disable the cyborg but kill the person who is using it. This story seems very plausible to me since already many people are using the internet to work from home, socially connect threw dating, on line chats, and live in a virtual world of their own choosing. I just see society taking the next step with cyborgs that will allow humans to make their fantasies into reality. You won't be disappointed with this movie.",1369008000,,767,4.370629370629371
3993997,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"I gotta say, I'm getting really tired of reading bad member reviews for movies I almost pass on, then watch and am suprised how good they are. Based on the bad reviews I almost passed on this one. Two many people out there reviewing films here that don't know what the hell they are doing and their taste seems to be in the toilet. I am beside my self why so many people didn't like this movie. I loved it. Judging from numerous member reviews here I thought this was going to be practically a dud. I found the exact opposite to be the case. This film was excellent. I felt the entire story was one of the better Sci-Fi ideas someone has come up with in a long time. It was filled with lots of action, well crafted special effects and an ingenious plot. Other films that were critically praised recently from the Sci-Fi world like District 9, which in my opinion wasn't as good as this movie was, simply were not as original or as interesting. Is it that my taste in film is really vastly different than that of so many others? The entire film was engrossing, exciting, unique and well done. This is one of the most original science fiction films I have seen in nearly 20 years. I liked it more than Disctrict 9 for certain. Liked it more than Minority Report. Like it more than A.I. Hell I liked it more than the last two Terminator films as well. This is right up there with the best sci-fi ever made as far as I am concerned. I found it an entertaining thought too that Bruce Willis looks a helluva lot better without the youthful appearance of his surrogate with that pile of blonde hair it had. I bet knowing that someone out there thinks he improves with age like a fine wine would at the very least put a smile of Bruces face. I really loved this film.

But as you know, not everybody liked that idea and so there was a rebellion. The movie had a couple of pretty good twists in the plot, where you think you know who're the good guys and who the bad ones, but that all changes towards the end.

I have no idea how seriously the creators of the movie took any ""message"" it might have had, but, if taken as a story with just one major gimmick, it can be good light entertainment with a somewhat novel twist. As one reviewer accurately put it: nothing is given much depth. In keeping with his well-cultivated image of many movies, Willis is the glue holding it all together, as an FBI agent, first as a surrogate (with hair)and then as the human behind the surrogate (without hair but unshaven) The rest of the cast performs service-ably and there are an adequate number of car scenes to keep the action-hungry satisfied.

I'm a moderate ran of Bruce Willis's, but his performance here is excellent. He's not a tough guy, he's a vulnerable guy and that's probably why I like him better. It is a sci-fi movie but really it's more about a man's attempt to break out of the shell that keeps him (and society in general) a prisoner. His awakening and his continued attempts to reach his wife are the best parts of the film for me. I like Ving Rhames, but that whole story line is forgettable as far as I'm concerned.

This is by far the best science fiction movie of the last 10 years.  The story is incredible and so socially relevant and revealing that, I believe, it should have been nominated for an academy award.  This movie is spellbinding with special effects that are incredible and a storyline as good as any you would want.  The only thing close to this is I, Robot.  Of course, its not outer space nonsense with no consideration of the weakness and frailty of the human body in the hostile non-gravity, frigid environment of everyplace but Earth.  But it is a glimse of the future on this planet.  If your a Sci-Fi enthusiast, you have seen all of the major movies with this theme.

3994026,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Surrogates(released Sept/09)stars Bruce Willis as Greer,Radha Mitchell as Peters,Rosamund Pike as Maggie Greer,Jack Noseworthy as Miles Strickland,James Cromwell as Dr. Lionel Canter,Ving Rhames as The Prophet,and others. It is a solid cast working with a very imaginative story that can sometimes be a bit overwhelming with what it has to impart within its' <90 minute time frame. I saw this film in its theatrical debut and that is the first impression I got,but having viewed it again after all this time I was able to digest some of the finer points I missed the first time around.
The story has our world in the future and most of the population runs their ""lives"" through surrogates,or remote controlled robots. You can be a man controlling a woman,or visa versa,or have a surrogate looking similar to yourself;the possibilities are endless. Of course there are those who do not believe that surrogates are a good thing and they are called Dredds,who live in cordoned off communities. The man who rules over these Dredds is called the Prophet(Rhames),and is quite militant when it comes to his ""untouched"" turf.
The story begins as the son of the inventor of surrogates is killed by a rogue carrying an awful weapon. The weapon not only fries the brains of the robots but the virus it implants also goes beyond safety protocols and fries the human brain. Greer(Willis)and his partner are FBI agents on the job investigating the crime. They soon discover the perp behind it all and the hunt is on.
Greer,in his surrogate,is in a helicopter above their man who is trapped in an alleyway,at the end of which are five cops. The cops are killed by the weapon and Greer's copter pilot also. Greer's surrogate is fried and Greer himself barely escapes getting killed. The copter goes down in Dredd territory and Greer/his surrogate almost gets his man,but is shot by one of the communities members,and gets away. The rogue ends up in the hands of the Prophet,i skilled,and now the Prophet has the deadly weapon to wield as he will.
Greer goes to the military telling them of the weapon he is after and they admit to its' previous usage. However they long ago scrapped the weapon because of its' unintended consequences,but obviously someone got a hold of one. The military make a raid on Prophet's compound and takes him and his guards down. We find that Prophet is nothing but a surrogate himself who is being controlled by none other than surrogates inventor,Dr. Cantor. Greer also learns it was his own boss that gave the weapon to the rogue. His boss was being paid by the company that manufactures surrogates,VSI,to take down Dr,Cantor(the reason they killed his son in the beginning of the film,to get to him).Dr Cantor we have already learned left VSI several years earlier because of his opposition to the entire surrogate program.
Now Dr Cantor has taken control of Greers partner's surrogate and has entered the main computer control FBI center. The surrogate hooks the weapon into the system and starts a viral download intended to finally end surrogacy and kill the people who operate them;multi-millions. At the same time Greer,in person,has forced his way into Dr Cantors house and has found HIS control facility. Before Greer can stop him,he swallows a cyanide pill and dies. Greer sits in the doctors chair and begins to control his partner's surrogate. With the help of the terminal operator who has been tied up,he manages to buffer the effects of the virus against the human component. Now all he has to do is press yes to kill the virus and save the robot surrogates,or press no and let the virus destroy the surrogates. He waits and waits until a bullet from a storming SWAT-like team member takes the surrogate down. Because of that the surrogates are all destroyed,everywhere,and Dr Cantor's scheme/mission, inadvertently in death,is still carried out;just not with the intended consequence of all the operators dying. The film fades as the news of the surrogate destruction gets splashed over all the TV networks.
The film raises some interesting philosophical questions about people and society and where we are headed in this age of computers that run so much of ours lives,even now. Wonder if one day we had no computers?This gadget has taken one on one personal contact and pushed it onto the back burner. The film takes us into the future and now personal contact is even far less than that;so rare in fact that many are unable to function if they're not using their surrogate. To show this the film at one point has Greer walking outside in the mostly surrogate populated streets,and his anxiety level is through the roof. A nice touch. The film has a kind of ""I,Robot"" feel to it too,though is not nearly on the same quality level,with even Cromwell in again as a brilliant scientist.
The film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a commentary track.
All in all it is a film I found to be much better on a second viewing. First timers will,like myself,find it a bit overwhelming in detail,and there is the point to be made as to why it should take a second viewing to ""get it"".However,it is an imaginative script and Willis is on game in this one.

There's the nugget of an interesting movie here but the concept of living through a surrogate isn't given the attention it deserves, and what we get instead is the usual action romp we've come to expect from Willis, who is, in fact, capable of more.

It ends too soon and their is not enough of his final ordinary world. I would give it a 2 out 5 stars because the spectacle hugely out weighed the story. Willis' character had the only real character development. Most of the other characters were easy to read and almost seemed fact. Also I was disappointed with its side plots. It is a tougher movie to connect with because in our technological age we don't really know what it would be like to have a surrogate or something like it. I really enjoyed the premise of the film. The moral behind the movie is a little weak. It attempts to say that we should live our lives through a robot, but we should live our own lives. It also taught that people love us for who we are and we don't have to put on a face or fake our character for them to love us. The film is worth renting if you can't find anything better. I would recommend for Junior High and up because of the violence. There is not much sexual innuendo in it except for a scene near the beginning in a club and then a couple goes outside and start to take clothes off before getting caught.",1315958400,,1252,4.177685950413223

But if you think this is your usual robot movie where the robots take over or destroy mankind -- Surrogates has a twist to it! In Surrogates,it's the people who control the robots! In Surrogates{which means'substitute'}man has done just that -- he has developed robots{or surrogates} to do most of the things for him! The people mostly stay at home and let their surrogates get out and do most of the things they would normally do{the surrogates are controlled by their operators from their house in a special surrogate 'chair' they lie in{and along with a head-set}let the surrogates get out and do the work}.Why get into all that traffic when you can just send your surrogate out in it? And why risk a bad day at the office when your surrogate can go FOR you? And if you have a hazardous job{like the military or police do},just send your surrogate out in your place so you don't have to take any risks! Just what mankind was looking for! But there's a fly in the ointment! Recently,someone has been destroying the surrogates,and worse than that,they are using some sort of 'secret' weapon that by-passes the surrogates fail-safes and also kills their human operators! This is when Bruce Willis{who works for the FBI}is brought in -- that is, his surrogate is brought in! Surrogates has a lot of action and good special effects in it,it also has a good plot to it.

That's because most of the 'people'you see in this movie are surrogates! You have to keep in mind that the actual people are back at their homes CONTROLLING the surrogates! That's what makes the movie hard to understand -- you have to keep in mind what's really going on! The movie comes at you so fast in so little time{it's only about 90 minutes long}that you really have to see it more than once. If you want to get the 'small details',you'll have to see it 3 or 4 times. I've seen reviews where people didn't like this movie -- mostly because they only saw it once. There's no way you'll understand this movie if you've only seen it once. Some have said it could have been longer or there could be more character developement. That's probably true.

Naturally there is a group of humans who refuse to embrace this new way of life and this is the driving force of the movie... which group is right? Unfortunately, someone has developed a weapon that shuts down the Surrogate and scrambles the brain of their owner. Who is behind it? Can Bruce Willis find out in time? I personally give the movie 4 stars because I liked it, but found the premise creepy on several different levels. My biggest problem with it was: Why pay all that money for some Cyborg if you are strapped to a chair the entire time they are at work doing your job for you running them so they can do your job? Otherwise, it is a great premise and does deliver a lot of twists and turns that make it worth the rental. I avoided going to see this at theaters because of all the bad press and reviews it got so please let me assure you that YES, I would have felt I had gotten my money's worth if I had seen it in a theater so do not let bad reviews and negative hype keep you from an enjoyable experience.

3994040,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"Imagine a future where we can plug our brains into robots that possess the grace and beauty of the human form.  We send them out into the world so we can experience everything they do and live vicariously through them from the comfort and safety of our homes.  That's the future depicted in the movie ""Surrogates.""  It seems plausible enough - like today's world only carried to its logical extreme.  There are glimmers of that future in the way we interact on social networks, where we can be what we want, do what we want and hide behind fake IDs.  When Bruce Willis observes a beautiful blonde surrogate walking the streets, he puts it this way:  ""For all I know that may be a big fat dude with his d--- hanging out.""

I found the premise of the movie interesting, combining elements from The Matrix, I,Robot, and Avatar.  It had promise but the movie, unfortunately, was disappointing.  Someone is using a taser-like weapon to fry surrogates' brains which simultaneously sends a signal to the operators, liquefying their brains too.  FBI agent Bruce Willis takes it upon himself to find the bad guy even if that means going out into the world - something he never does - and doing it in person.  You see, his surrogate was destroyed by a renegade band of humans in a rather spectacular chase and helicopter crash.  The renegades are led by a prophet who wishes to end surrogacy once and for all.

Comparing his performance here to that in the Die Hard trilogy (which I really enjoy), Bruce Willis lacks intensity and seems merely to be going through the motions.  The younger Bruce Willis displayed in the surrogate was an interesting special effect, but not enough to carry the story.  I didn't care enough about his character or the back story involving his wife and kid, and I found little chemistry between him and his partner.  There are a couple of exciting chases but the movie drags on before grinding to a predictable halt.  I couldn't help but lose interest half way through the story.",1313020800,4,1999,4.64957264957265

3994044,1,B002UZCJ8Y,"There was a place and time when I flocked to his movies.  I really thought he had something that most actors didn't have, and I still consider his contribution to 80's/90's cinema to be outstanding.  He truly was an underrated cinematic accessory.  Still, his movie choices as of late have been less than desirable, and while I was initially intrigued by `Surrogates', it wound up being one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.

The film takes place in the not so distant future when life as we know it is completely different.  Human beings have the option of being pushed to the outskirts of civilization by bucking the trends or caving into a new way of life, living in a chair while you mentally move your robotic counterparts like chess pieces around the world.  Life is devoid of consequences as you live out your fantasies from your living room sofa.  The good life, packaged and sold to the consumer, finally shows its flaws when two humans wind up dead after their `surrogates' are murdered.  The failsafe didn't work, as promised, and soon the police are investigating.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the type of movie this was supposed to be and so its not like I had my hopes high, but the film just feels so cheaply constructed.  Yes, the visuals are in tact (for the most part) and the way they used CGI to smooth out the surrogates was intriguing, but the plot was poorly conceived and the films overall construction felt bare.  It wants to be a character piece, but it doesn't take the time to really flesh anyone or anything out.  In the end it becomes `just another' action film, except this time the script is so ridiculous that you become turned off entirely.  The acting is also a big question-mark.

3994047,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"This film is a futuristic dystopian sci-fi action film.  The basic scoop is that a prosthetics company developed the technology for parapalegics and quadrapalegics to connect with a synthetic body (a robot = surrogate) with which they can navigate the world, and interact with other people without the hiderance of their disabilities.  But, as expected, the technology catches on and it's not long before mass production of the units drops their price sufficiently so that just about everyone an afford them, and uses them, and they don't even leave their homes any more.  Then, of course, there is backlash against ""the machine.""  The up side is that crime drops to nearly nil.  The down side, people are losing touch with reality.

Bruce Willis plays an FBI agent, and he and his wife are struggling wtih the stresses of losing a child in an accident.

When crimes start to happen Willis and his partner are soon hot on the trail of individuals whose goal is unclear, but, well, that's what the story is about.

Be advised that while there is actually minimal foul language and sexual content, but there is a LOT of violence.  The violence involves largely the surrogates, and all kinds of damage to them.  Even so, it can get pretty gritty.  So if that troubles you, I advise that you steer clear.

All in all, I enjoyed the film, thuogh it is not likely to become any kind of classic.

3994048,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"This movie is a total justification of the whole Amazon review system. So first of all congratulations and thank you to every reviewer- all most interesting and readable from the 1 stars to the 5 stars, from the serious to the smart-assed one liners such as Zoe who wished her surrogate had watched it for her..

This, in turn, guarantees the movie at least 3 stars. For the simple reason that it makes you think. It is not just a slick, high budget hollywood movie. In fact a lot of it is not slick or visually impressive at all. The street scenes and the 90s Eurocopter chopper do not compare with the settings of, say, Blade Runner. In fact it was Blade Runner that I was drawn to as comparison rather than I Robot or The Island...

I can not compete with the erudition and wit of so many but here are a couple of points.

As an old snob and book reader, I have never read any graphic novels - despite their massive sales and influence. Sorry. Can someone tell us how well this sticks to the original?

As a Sci-Fi fan of over 50 years I am very grateful that from time to time we are thrown movie bones to chew. I seem to always like them, even and especially comedies like Galaxy Quest and Dave. Only do not like them if dull and bombastic like 2001 or the Planet of the Apes remake....

So I loved every minute of the film. It is not in the least a 'Robots Gone Wrong' film but a discussion as to whether the Humans have gone wrong in totally relying on robots. When you think at the end, as with most sci fi and all time travel except the Simpsons episode, there are massive holes in the concept. Not least being how on earth the humans might even dream of surviving without robots....

The casting is mostly brilliant; loved Bruce and the Bruce robot. Earned the movie an extra star. Feel a bit sorry that the farmer from Babe (Cromwell) has had to be so dark in everything since 6 Feet Under.

And there is one breathtaking moment about 25 minutes into the film when you realise that almost every living person you have seen in the movie so far is , in fact, a robot. Then you meet a human still working and he is a fat slob!

So at a time of collapsing numbers in movie theatres, mindless films like The Expendables and movies aimed mainly at pre-teens allowed a night out, let us be grateful for a film aimed at adults and with plenty to think about.",1294272000,2,2361,4.242761692650334
3994049,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"If you liked the movies I, Robot and Minority Report, you will feel right at home with Surrogates.

As he did in I, Robot, James Cromwell has created a fleet of robots to replace humanity's role on the planet. He has created surrogates - robots that we can plug into - who are perfect and practically indestructable. People just recline in their comfy chairs while putting high-tech tanning glasses on and let their brainwaves do the work.

Bruce Willis is FBI agent Tom Greer who is brought on a case dealing with the death of Cromwell's son. Rosamund Pike plays Greer's wife, Maggie who loves being in the surrogate to the detriment of her own body.

Ving Rhames stars as The Prophet, the leader of humans who don't believe in conducting business as surrogates.

Following the death of the son, we're led down a twist-turning path. How can you know who to trust when you aren't even sure who you're looking at is really them? Did that sentence seem confusing? So can this movie with the number of plot holes.

It does get a good rating from me for it's lack of questionable material. Yet it does include a number of swear words.

The action and chase sequences are above par, but you can tell when the special effects are in place and that sort of takes you out of the movie.

I like the idea, its a kind of metaphor for people staying home on Facebook and other things all night and not actually ever doing anything outside their personal bubble. The film adds on this as Bruce Willis is forced to begin living life without his surrogate body and go out as a normal human again. The drama adds further in the fact that Bruce has not seen his wife in a long time, even inside their own home. Even when confronted she just says, ""this is my body now."" So what didn't I like about this, mainly, it doesn't really feel like it knows what it wants to do. At times its a good action movie, at others a mystery, at others a drama. It also lacks depth, we see a news story at the beginning about whats going on and then boom your in it. It also has parts that I guess your suppossed to just figure out on your own, i.e. their are several different bad guys, but we don't get a backstory on them, we simply know ""they are bad.""

3994051,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"This film has a brilliant concept. However, the writers failed to convert the concept into a viable plot.

The plot when examined is really a contradiction of itself. The inventor of the surrogate technology, decides that it should no longer be used, because humanity is losing its soul.

But at the same time he makes use of the very technology to champion the cause to terminate the use of the technology. Eventually, in some irrational thinking, he decides that every one that is hooked into a surrogate should be killed when he shuts down the system that manages the link-up of the surrogates. Is this the salvation that 'the Prophet' is offerring?

There are too many loose ends and story is really a no-brainer. In my opinion, the producers made a good film at the expense to making a great film.

The special effects are far and few, but well done, most of the time it is just very well made up persons pretending to be robots. Bruce Willis was really the only shining light in this film.",1288051200,,995,4.573033707865169

JM chopped the Terminator franchise off at the knees with T3 to the point where even the Terminator 90210 TV show ignored the film completely. Now he's been presented with yet another high-concept premise and has a Michael Bay-like drive to totally mess it up in a way so vicious that a sequel is as unlikely as someone not mistaking Bruce Willis' toupe for a Zhu Zhu hamster. Mostow should be banned from going near any other scripts or ideas - he's the sort of guy who could film The Bible and cause an exodus from the religion.

That being said, the concept is strong here - people controlling robots to represent themselves in the real world in an Avatar kind-of-way, and there are some interesting flaws and side-effects that could have been the foundation of a really excellent sci-fi franchise. Instead we're presented with mindless and pointless action sequences that rob the audience of the promised emotional engagement. And much like T3, even the expensive CGI and visuals lack impact - though they effectively sell the Surrogates concept.

3994060,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"The film ""Surrogates"" when first released in the cinema escaped my attention, and I only really watched it by both coincidence and my own laziness. Picture the scene, you have the movie channel on, it's late, you're tired and you can't find the remote. Rather than getting up to look for it I thought to myself ""f*** it, I'll just watch what's on next""; what was on next was Surrogates. Suddenly very vague memories of the times seeing the trailer and thinking to myself ""hmm, I should see that"" came flushing back and I simply decided to keep watching. Not a particularly engaging or important film, what really captivated me was that this film said a hell of a lot more than I imagined it would about the society that we live in and the way it's going.

Set sometime in the future, humans have decided to lie back and live out their lives as remotely controlled androids built to their specifications. Almost the entire human race decides to live out their lives in these robotic bodies, but a few small reservations of humanity, who choose not to live as robots still exist and, lead by a man known as The Prophet (Ving Rhames), seek to end this abomination. A string of mysterious murders take place where the android is destroyed using a special weapon, which at the same time kills its controller. Called in to investigate these crimes are Agents Greer (Bruce Willis) & Peters (Radha Mitchell).

Agent Greer has a more personal presence on the screen (as he is the star, durr) and it deals with the more personal impacts of living your life in the body of a robot. Agent Greer struggles to reconcile his differences with his wife over the failing relationship with his wife and lack of any human contact between them, as they have only come to communicate via their androids, motivated by the death of their son. The investigation into the cause of the murders comes with a lot of surprises both fairly humorous and genuinely surprising.

The message of the movie was the most interesting element of the whole thing. Sure, there were some great action scenes and Bruce Willis' presence was what really secured this movie's credibility, but it said so much about the way in which society seems to be going. We've become an internet obsessed society, a medium which can allow us to become whoever we want and with games such as ""Second Life"" and ""World of Warcraft"" having literally millions of users, they allow for a welcome escapism from the horror or pain of real life. Personally, I would say it's only a matter of something like 100 years at the most and we will be close to the society depicted in this movie.

3994063,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"How pervasive is technology? How desensitizing is it? How frightened and paranoid are we now of everything? SURROGATES takes our obsession with online chat rooms and progresses it to something even more subversive. In the near future, a technology is developed in which we don't even have to leave our homes to enjoy a ""full life."" Instead our minds inhabit robotic doppelgangers and these puppets assume our careers and interact - or is it interface? - with our friends and associates... who are also puppets. In the near future, to live remotely, vicariously, is the safest and vastly preferred option, never mind that it's so... sterile.

Not everyone buys into this surrogacy. Surrogacy-free zones dot the landscape peopled by a maverick society which would rather breathe the good air and feel that warm sunlight on living skin. Surrogates call these folks ""meatbags."" The movie opens with a surrogate being destroyed by a sort of ""overload device"" and the mind linked to it fried like eggs sunny side up. Or was the brain liquified in its skull? I can't remember, but the result is the same. The hammer drops when it's learned that the victim is the son of the scientist who invented surrogate technology. And can the meatbags be that far behind when suspects are lined up?

What kills me is that, in this film, people have found a new and really rude way to disengage from a difficult conversation, simply by turning off their surrogates. This is even more jarring than when someone hangs up the phone on you.

In this cold new environment, illusions are created so conveniently, like it ain't no thing. Blemishes are handily erased. A hairy fat man could be a svelte young woman. A nerdy Caucasian lab scientist could be a strapping black lab scientist. Bruce Willis could be Bruce Willis with a fuller head of hair. SURROGATES is adapted from a graphic novel, and that's a plus for me. Bruce Willis plays FBI Agent Tom Greer who investigates the baffling murder mystery... and Bruce Willis in these sci-fi action roles is always an incentive for me to tune in. Willis has earned massive, massive good will from me via his work in THE FIFTH ELEMENT and 12 MONKEYS alone.

Bruce finds himself in a film touting one of them ambitious concepts but, as ever, what really draws me in are the humanizing elements. The sci-fi premise rocks, yeah, but it's when Tom Greer is forced to venture out in the streets in his very own bruised-up flesh that I really edged up on my seat. It isn't really until he's mingling with the robot mannequins that it sinks in just how much of an alien beast this surrogacy society has become. Willis has acting chops enough that he easily conveys that emotional hurt and horror brought about by a past tragedy (which I actually thought unnecessary) and by his ever growing disconnect with his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike). Maggie would rather spend all her time in her surrogate body and live a happy life of illusion. And over time Greer and his wife have grown emotionally detached. And then, of course, Radha Mitchell would hurl that parking meter at him... No wonder that, later, when Agent Greer is faced with a life-defining choice, you're never quite sure which way he would tilt. Ultimately, it's Bruce Willis's grounding presence which salvages this movie for me.

Agent Greer eventually uncovers a diabolical plot to purge the world of surrogates, not that I cared about any of that. Because by that point I'd grown disenchanted with a plot which bogs down and is ultimately lifeless and done by rote. SURROGATES soon becomes just another sci-fi action thriller, when it could've been more than that, when it could've been, for example, another BLADERUNNER. And the murder mystery? It's pretty easy to finger the man hiding in the shadows, manipulating events. On the good side of the ledger, I do appreciate the little touches the actors commit to in their surrogate roles. Whether it's with a look or a gesture or a pose, a subtle something to suggest that certain stiffness and artificiality. I thought Rosamund Pike was particularly phenomenal at this. But it's really weird nowadays to see Bruce Willis with a healthy coif.",1278806400,,4170,4.810320781032078
3994064,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Bruce Willis is known for two types of movies.  The first type are the shoot-em up action flicks as typified by his Die Hard franchise.  The second type are the thinking movies, the ones that mark him as a good actor who knows how to pick original roles.  Examples of the latter include The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now this 2009 film that slipped under most people's radar; Surrogates.  The movie's premise is simple enough, in the near future, much of mankind live their daily lives thru human-like robots known as surrogates.  The main plot of the movie revolves around a series of murders, the politics behind them, and the attempts to solve them by the cop played by Willis.  And like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the movie's climax involves some surprising twists.  Hence the movie is a mystery-suspense thriller with some action scenes behind it.  The movie is futuristic, but not really in the science fiction genre as the technology displayed in the film is probably achievable within a decade or so.

The only drawback to the movie is its main subplot, which revolves around the failing marriage between the characters played by Willis and actress Rosamund Pike.  It seems many of Willis's serious movies features a subplot of marital distress.  This was present in the Die Hard movies, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Armageddon, and now this film.  This subplot has been repeated too many times, and could have been done better for this film.  Outside of this critique, this was a good film that moved quickly and did not drag.",1278288000,,1542,4.8396946564885495
3994065,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"At first I thought this would be a typical big special effects action movie, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was much more subdued than I thought it would be and I really liked the movie. The basic setting of the movie is a near-future society in which people can connect to robots and and live vicariously through them. This is portrayed as being very positive, especially at the beginning of the film. However, the conflict arises when an FBI agent becomes involved in investigating a murder in which a robot was destroyed and its operator was killed as a side effect. Without revealing a lot of the plot, I'll just say that this plays out somewhat like a sci-fi police action movie, but although there are action scenes and good-guy-has-to-save-the-world scenario, all of this is quite subdued and tastefully done compared to many current big action films. It sort of provides a background to the movie rather than being the eye-catching focus. Because of this, the movie becomes a thought-provoking exercise in which you imagine what such a society would be like and you consider some of the ramifications. Even Bruce Willis, who plays the main character is somewhat more subdued than in some of his other action roles. He does a good job with this role and it's kind of fun to see him as his surrogate version with hair and a younger look. I think this movie is especially thought-provoking not because we might soon be using robots as surrogates in life, but rather because we already substitute different forms of technology for real-life experience. In a way, participating in on-line discussions, having avatars, texting and working remotely from home are somewhat like having surrogates. While this kind of technology can open up many opportunities in life, it can also diminish our humanity and isolate us. I think this is one sub-text of this movie. In any case, do check this movie out. You will be happy you did.",1278028800,,1940,4.794029850746269
3994066,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"There are not a lot of original elements to Surrogates, but I argue that there is a fantastic and creative presentation of those elements.  The film immerses the audience in a future fantasy world where robots act as surrogates for real people.  The real people are in darkened apartments or condos, logged on to a global virtual reality network.  Meanwhile, their too-beautiful and too-perfect surrogates are going to work, dancing in clubs, meeting people, and doing all the things humans--with all their flaws--used to do on their own in front of real people.  There is no crime and there is no racism, because everyone is gorgeous and cannot get physically hurt...or can they?

This social networking criticism would be silly and would alienate the audience if there wasn't a sense of humor attached to it.  I particularly like the idea that not everyone's robot is top-of-the-line, because not everyone can afford the best.  This is exactly what has been going on in the real world for nearly a decade now: All of those gadgets and phones that have been pushed on people have truly exposed those who indentify themselves via material status and those who consider gadgets to be tools that aren't significantly different from a hammer or a vacuum cleaner.

The film reminds me a little of Demolition Man in its ability to immerse the viewer.  While Demolition Man was not a great movie, there were tireless details in the background that made the world of the film come alive.  Surrogates does this as well: Background characters will say something or something will happen that is incidental to the world the film portrays, but if the same thing were to happen in the real world, we would find it quite peculiar, indeed.

Much of the success of this film relies heavily on Bruce Willis (character name, Tom Greer).  He is eternally John McClane, the modern cowboy from Die Hard.  And he's just as watchable now as he was twenty years ago.  Rosamund Pike's portrayal of Greer's wife, Maggie, is almost too good for this film.  She represents the dark sadness of a life lived vicariously.

I find that Surrogates can be forgiven for its obvious message, because it tells that message so well and also remains quite entertaining.  The blend of action of social commentary worked well enough for me, even if I knew the ending within the first twenty minutes.",1277856000,,2359,4.8283582089552235

Anyway.........Here's the scoop. Yes this movie stars Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell and James Cromwell but the real star here is the art department. Mannequins are inherently creepy and this movie is loaded with a bunch of them that are animated. They look human.....almost. They move like humans.....almost. So it really creeps you out. They're all just off enough to remind you they're not human. Most of the actors portraying surrogates do a really nice job so it adds to the creep factor of the whole thing.

In a nutshell, Willis and Mitchell are detectives on a case where not only do a couple of surrogates get wasted but their operators get wasted as well. This is not supposed to happen. The two begin to investigate and the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper.

The story is descent enough and the actors do a genuinely fine job, though I'm not certain why they cast Ving Rames in his role. Big mistake. It just doesn't work. Like in the aforementioned Hardwired, they do make the mistake of figuring a very few people can bring down an entire system but by that time you've seen a lot of really cool stuff.

I liked this film better than the paid reviewers but I realize this isn't going to change anyone's life. It's just good popcorn level Sci-Fi film making. The production values are high enough to further the feeling of having a bunch of near humans running around.

3994075,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"""Surrogates"" is an action movie taking place in a world where there is no action.  Not any real action anyway.  Everyone in the world is allowed to sit in their homes and their replica robot is a doing all the real living.  Granted you feel what the robot feels, and you control the robot.  All of this from the comfort of your home.  You literally never have to leave the house, EVER.  You can also choose your robot to look like anyone or anything.  You can be a hot smoking blonde girl, even if you are an old fat perverted dude.  Now how is that for a plot?

Can you imagine making out with a gorgeous girl robot only to find out she was really a dude in drag.  Damn, that sounds like every night in San Francisco.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.  Wait a minute, the only thing wrong with that scenario is some bad guys recently came up with a weapon that can kill your robot, and as your robot lays smoldering in a pile of burnt out electric circuits it somehow fries the operator's brain as well.  So much for going sky diving and not caring if your parachute opens or not.

So Bruce Willis (the FBI Agent) begins the process of tracking down this freaky person that want to kill off real people and begin society's trek back to a crime infested pool of wrong doers.  In the process he loses his surrogate and has to meander out of the house for the first time in God only knows how many years.  It reminds me of getting the mail after lying around in my underwear writing all day.  There are several plot twists and turns as you jump from assuming it is one bad guy to the next, but it really isn't that hard to figure out the overall direction the movie is going.

Bruce Willis plays his tried and true gritty cop character, and as always he pulls it off very well.  I wonder sometimes if he lives in Idaho walking around scaring the crap out of people.  The theme of the movie was a little eerie.  With the introduction of facebook, myspace and the myriad of social networks it seems our friends are becoming faceless characters on a computer screen.  We are well on our way  to becoming couch potatoes, with surrogates just being the next step in evolution.  I am now beginning to think it might be interesting to venture out of the house a little more often, once in a while.

It wasn't my favorite Bruce Willis movie, but I did enjoy it more than enough to happily pay the $5.99 on demand fee while I sat at home, hung over, watching it.  The next time I see a movie I might actually venture out to the theater and who knows, maybe even have dinner in a restaurant.

A cross between Westworld, Blade Runner, Stepford Wives and I Robot, SURROGATES never soars or bores, but it could've been a lot darker and intriguing.  So many possibilities.  It just felt a little pat rather than gripping - as is the problem with so many Hollywood movies these days.  Still Bruce is good action eye candy - but this is definitely not 12 Monkeys territory.

The only really good things here are the concept, Bruce Willis, and some colorful moments. But the script is no great shakes, the supporting actors are uniformly dull (Ving Rhames is B-grade as usual), and one gets the feeling this could have been so much more.

Kind of a Blade Runner/Matrix/Brainstorm concept, the idea is great, and one of the best things here is the extra documentary. There are some interesting points made there that should have been explored in depth more in the film. As someone says in the extras, the telling thing is that we're already in a society where looking as good as possible is so many folks' ultimate goal; surrogates are a logical extension of that. But the many ripe possibilities are merely touched on, and I rarely say this but this movie is actually a little short! More time should have been taken to flesh out the many tertiary idas of the premise, and all in all it feels thinner than it should.

But Willis plays the tough/tender guy, as he has since first arriving in Moonlighting, and he's as enjoyably believable as ever. He's still fun to watch and sells this movie when it needs selling. Still, the direction is fair enough, and all told I enjoyed watching this.

The only time you're not in your surrogate body is when you are 1) asleep, 2) preoccupied with a call of nature, or 3) stuffing your face with food so you can get back to the surrogate control couch.

Life would be different.  You'll see that in Surrogate, the movie.

Of course, the ability of 6+ billion people to be able to even afford this technology, its construction and maintenance, let along the extraordinary associated energy costs, wasn't really part of the story line.  It's an assumption.

And that assumption spoiled this movie for me.  I mean, I like a good futuristic tale, but the whole rationale for most people to lock themselves inside, presumably until they die (because they only get more unkempt, overweight, out of shape, immobile, and older as the years go on), just wasn't developed well.

Bruce Willis is a cop (duh), and he finds himself on the lookout for a real human who can ""flash"" a surrogate and also kill, remotely, its associated human handler.  Yikes!  And when his surrogate is destroyed, he has to resort to actually, in person, hitting the streets.  So there is grizzled Bruce Willis in a population of blemish-free surrogates.

I don't plan to give away any of the mystery, so that's it as far as a plot recap goes.  Suffice it to say that Willis is a great actor, and without him this movie doesn't go very far.

The so called surrogates of the movie were clearly unconscious robots having no will of their own.  The concept of the general public using robotic bodies (remotely from their home while interacting with the world through a special simulation couch)is interesting, but an enormous waste of energy for a society trying desperately to ""go green"" (ugh) and to individuals, except perhaps for someone terribly maimed by an accident or otherwise bound to a wheel chair.  The idea is just nuts, but very interesting to think about. Think about robots driving cars, using mass transit systems, and other crowded and energy consuming resources. It obviously makes no sense, except as an allegory for the World Wide Web.

Also interesting was that the ""operators"" of surrogates no longer took time to dress for work or waste their time on grooming because they must now keep the android properly attired and groomed for business.  The operators of surrogates were shown not to use make up, shave or dress and this is a reasonable projection of what would happen to individuals who work from home and interact with the world, their business associates and friends using the World Wide Web.

I am a long time sci-fi fan and prefer robot stories which explore artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic ""consciousness"" in the sense of the Spielberg film by that name(and Arthur C.

I saw this movie, starring a VERY young Bruce Willis, with my father in the early eighties.

Being totally freaked out by the movie, my first sci-fi experience at the age of 10 years, I remember my father saying: ""You just watch that youngster Bruce Willis -- one day he will be a super star. (Little did I know...)

Only today, almost 30 years later, I can really appreciate the scientific insight the producers showed at the time:

1. Most of the vehicles in the movie resembles 2006+ models -- its almost scary that the futuristic cars that impressed me so much as a kid, turned out to be spot-on in their design.

2. Look out when a memory stick is used with the computers -- what an amazing insight of the designers who did the graphics.

3. Kudos to the make-up-artists who 'aged' Bruce Willis so masterfully that even this Die-Hard-fan cannot tell the difference between the 'aged' Bruce and the present-day-Bruce.

I am just gratefull that the Secrete Weapon to kill off the surrogates AND their Controllers (humans), only materialized as a Taser in real life!, which kills humans with heart problems only. -- but again, what an insight the writer had into the future.

3994096,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Surrogates, starring Bruce Willis, is a Sci-Fi flick that has a whole new take on robots.  Once again, I am going to complain about all the critics and so-called critics out there who like to demolish movies like this.  Here's the scoop:

It's obvious, and we have known for a while now, that Hollywood is running out of ideas.  Book authors, it seems, aren't, but movie writers are.  Why?  I have no idea, whatsoever.  What I do know is that sequel after sequel after sequel after remake after remake after remake are coming from that star-infested little town by the City of Angels.  Now it seems that when anything comes out of there with a sense of freshness and newness, its shot down by critics like the plague.  Case in point...Surrogates.  An original idea presented in an original way by a VERY good cast, but since its not another remake or a sequel, it has been bashed up one side and down the other...over and over and over again.

C'mon, people.  If we are so lucky to experience a NEW idea for a change, then give it the kudos it deserves!  This movie wasn't five-star material--it could have been, I think, if it would have delved just a bit deeper into the psyche of the people living their lives as surrogates as opposed to experiencing life first hand--but it was definitely four-star, and this is why:

1. Excellent casting
2. Excellent acting - made you almost believe that the surrogates were, indeed, surrogates
3. Excellent directing - Bruce looked so severely out of place in his own skin amongst the populace of surrogates (great job with this)
4. Original story
5. Atmospheric, almost to a claustrophobic degree
6. Awesome production value

Four Stars ****",1268179200,,1682,4.673469387755102
3994097,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Movie - 3.0

Surrogates strikes me as a another sci-fi actioner with a very good concept on how society as a whole is becoming more and more reliant on the uses of advancing technology. Why worry about actually exercising when all you have to do is transfer your brain waves into a life-like robot that's designed to look the way you want it? The approach to Surrogance in itself makes for some great reflections on sloth and vanity and how we've become so enamored with what's ""ideal,"" as apparent by the setting and plot. But when moral dilemmas about the artificiality of life start surfacing, all sorts of friction can start to develop, which is essentially the kind of issues the film tries to discuss. However, with only an 88 minute run time the movie feels way too short and never really addresses the complexities as elaborately as it could. The screenplay also suffers from lack of development for Bruce Willis' character and never really has enough of a buildup to make said complexities feel as wholly riveting like, say, the more recent I,Robot. On the flip side, though, the movie still makes for decent entertainment with what it ends up being and only disappoints with its missed potential. This is the first Jonathan Mostow film I've seen at this point, so I didn't really know what to expect, but I have seen quite a few Bruce Willis movies and am happy with his continuing effort and exceptional acting ability for that ""rugged, yet vulnerable kind of guy"" archetype. James Cromwell doesn't play very big roles, but I've been a fan of his for a while and have always enjoyed his quaint and father-like subtlety as well. I also like Ving Rames, but seeing him with dreadlocks feels kind of silly. Good effort by Mostow.

Video - 4.0

Presented by Disney/Buena Vista in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.40) Surrogates looks good. I only say good because a big factor in reflecting the artificiality of Surrogance is the very smudgy skin textures present in about 90% of the people in the movie. Some could say it's an accurate transfer as per aesthetic intention, but it still feels like looking at a bunch of faces that were heavily DNR'd. Aside from that, though, everything else looks great. Colors are vibrant, if not a tad muted at times to coincide with the dystopic feel of the art direction. Black levels are inky, contrast is accurate, and detail is excellent on actual people not using Surrogates. Check out Willis' stubble when he's walking out and about.

Audio - 5.0

Unlike the somewhat underwhelming video presentation, the DTS-HD 5.1 track has no oddities in it whatsoever. Much of the film in the beginning is very dialogue-driven, but when action sequences start weaving themselves into the plot, sound effects really boom. Side speakers do an outstanding job moving the on-screen action from one side of the room to the other. High and low ends are accurate when need be and the music never feels overpowering. LFEs, however are the real treat. Gunshots, helicopters, and car crashes dominate the sound stage and really give your sub-woofer a workout adding a great sense of depth and realism to progressing urgency of the plot. There aren't a whole lot of action big sequences, unfortunately, but when there are they're reference material.

Extras - 3.0

Aside from the informative commentary by Mostow, the extra features don't amount to much else. In fact, I'd even say I'm a little angry at the main vignette and how it almost totally defeats the purpose of the movie. The ""Science of Surrogates"" feature spends nearly all of its time addressing real-world applications and the benefits of using technology to such an advanced level that we will inevitably develop and take advantage of it to the fullest. But for a film that just did the opposite and showed the disadvantages of such ideology, it boggles my mind why they'd suddenly contradict the entire point of the story and pretty much shrug it off at the end by saying ""well, there ARE disadvantages, too [fade out]...,"" which serves as another example of how the overall project just doesn't live up to its potential. The other features are a short look at the original graphic novel that the movie is based on, deleted scenes, and a music video by Breaking Benjamin (in HD and DD 5.1!) for the song ""I Will Not Bow.""

Overall - 4.0

Of all the genres out there, I'd have to say science fiction is probably my favorite. It allows for so many questions to be asked and is also very easy for us to relate to today and as we advance further into the future. Surrogates has a very intriguing concept that possessed a lot of potential, but in the end feels exceedingly underwhelming with barely an hour and a half to explore the complexities and dilemmas mentioned in the film. But if you're in the mood for a quick-paced, sci-fi action thriller and are a fan of Bruce Willis, Surrogates may just provide enough with its presentable video and reference audio to make this a worthy addition to your collection. Viewers wanting a little more depth, though, would be wise to give this a rent first.",1268092800,2,5136,4.723214285714286

3994105,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Okay, so obviously this film is a bit divisive. The critics by and large were not kind to it, and there are quite a few reviewers here that agree with them. For my part, I liked it.

The story is intriguing and kind of plausible - if human beings could be Sims, would we? I'm inclined to think yes. I'm a bit skeptical that our becoming Sims would lead to some of the places the writers posit (Reduced crime? Really? Human-only reservations within major US cities free from the jurisdiction of the FBI? Um, what?), but you don't have to buy into every facet of a science fiction world before you can feel at home within it generally.

Without giving away too much, this story is a clash of Titans - pro-Surrogate/anti-Surrogate, duking it out - and Bruce Willis is an FBI agent swept up into it who (and I really like this part) just doesn't bog down in the details. There's enough exposition from the people around him to fill out the major outlines for the audience at home, but Greer/Bruce is living in the moment. He (and his story) waste little time pondering the wherefores and hows of these Titans. He's dealing with the fallout, trying to find out just enough to do what he needs to do, filtering it all through his emotions. As a result, some parts of the film feel sketchy...really, pretty much like life. We don't often get the big picture, and it's a bold general audience film that follows suit. Kind of a _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_ for the action crowd; you just know that if the story had been told from the perspective of, say, The Prophet it would have been a very different tale.

Are you going to like it?

Well. If you like a neat, fully explained story, probably not. If you like clearly defined heroes and villains, you might not like it, either. You're hard pressed to find somebody in this story who doesn't seem to think that the ends justify the means. But if you like an interesting idea with competent execution, a kind of brisk-paced action adventure with a well-portrayed character at the margins of a much larger story, you might.",1267315200,,2074,4.522666666666667

The moral grounds make this interesting at first, but then I'm thinking, come on!  Do I need to be blunted over the head with the message that living your life through a robot is bad?  If this script had some restraint and wove a more intricate tale of the mystery behind the murders then it could have been very good.  But what we have is an obvious morality tale with a redundant message and a murder mystery with a very unsatisfying resolution.  Visual effects were good.  I like to escape in sci-fi movies like these, but not when they depict all of humanity gone way stupid over technology.  Give me a break!  Ridiculous and not very thrilling either.

3994114,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"A movie about a robot Bruce Willis fighting crime?  Sounds like an action-adventure extraordinaire!

People who watch surrogates expecting ""Die Hard"" with a Sci-Fi twist are going to be disappointed.  But if you watch the movie without any expectations at all, you'll find a very interesting character piece that explores a bifurcated existence for the entire human population that is an obvious metaphor for how the internet simultaneously unites and divides us.  The movie explores how a safety-obsessed culture, aided by technology, becomes universally agoraphobic, and what effect that has on human interaction.

The year is unstated but from the look of the film it is in the not-too-distant future.  A technological advance allows people to control a robotic body--a surrogate--from the safety of their own home.  Originally intended to help handicapped people get around and carry on in the real world free from their physical impairments, surrogates are rapidly adopted by the populace at large.  Having a surrogate means always being beautiful, or in fact, being whatever you want.  The effects crew on this film do a wonderful job of taking live actors and digitally airbrushing their skin to give them a somewhat unrealistically perfect appearance.

Willis loses his robot body during pursuit of a criminal, and has to venture out into the real world himself.  He finds it terrifying.  His partner comes to pick him up at the hospital, and despite years working with him, she's never seen him before.  He desperately wants to connect with his wife, wonderfully played by Rosamund Pike--but she is more interested in hiding behind her surrogate than most.  While the ideas of surrogacy aren't new ideas, they aren't new because they affect us --today-- which, in my mind, is part of what makes this film interesting.  Here in the real world there are people who fly drone missions in Afghanistan from the safety of an office in California--the most dangerous part of their involvement in the war is their commute to work.  Surrogates explores this idea too--soldiers on a ""peace-keeping operation"" fight via surrogates from the safety of a command center thousands of miles away.

I don't want to give everything away, but I think this movie was wonderful.  I watched it on pay-per-view without knowing ANYTHING about it--no expectations--and enjoyed it immensely.  I went right out and bought a copy the next day.  Watch it with an open mind--particularly if you like character pieces.",1266192000,39,2496,5.1464019851116625

I found it very interesting in premise and filled with good performances through out. It's not one of the dazzling special effects laden thrill ride so many movies are today, it doesn't try to be or need to be. Perhaps because it tells a story and has a plot, it doesn't need to rely on an overload of special effects to hold the audiance. While I have some minor criticisms of the storyline, overall it was well written and Willis gives a strong performance as an ""everyman"" trapped in a world where he doesn't necessarily fit in.

3994117,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"While the plot can sometimes be difficult to follow, ""Surrogates"" has something else going for it: it's probably one of the most beautifully filmed movies of 2009.

Cameraman Oliver Wood drenches every scene and character is gorgeous oolor.  I found myself pausing the picture throughout just to drool over the beauty.  This also includes the performers.  Not since MGM's heyday during the 30s have actors looked so ravishing--and this includes Bruce Willis when he's in his robot mode.

Willis does an outstanding job throughout. Often, his face and body language convey his emotions and thoughts, evidence of a true and veteran movie performer.

Equally as good as the photographey is the knock-out musical score of Richard Marvin.  His incessant usage of strings and woodwinds builds the excitement up to unnerving intensity. Should any studio be foolish enough to remake ""Psycho"" again, Marvin is definitely the composer they should turn to.

The movie ran just under 90 minutes and left me with the feeling that this was a cut-down version of it (a 2-hour version might have worked better).

The video and audio were very good (especially considering it's a recent release with a bigger budget), the extras were decent (a couple features and a commentary) but not great. It's a nice demo disc, but not something you'd want to watch more than a couple times.

I loved the whole concept and idea behind the movie. I also love the technology diplayed as well, (movies like the new Star Trek, Deja Vu, and Alien) Who did not love the room ""Mother"" was in on the Nostromo. I admit, I do love when thay combine technology and use it in a new concept. The movie is worth watching just for the idea behind it. If you loved ""Data"" on Star Trek - TNG, you'll love this movie.

You would think that in the age of surrogates and modern technology I would not be seeing the minorities dressed up like Jamicans living in the 1960's or 70's. I understand what the movie was trying to convey, they are against surrogates so they must also be against technogoly. Wrong Hollywood. We all live in the 20th century and I do believe it's possible to be against surrogates but understand some technogoly works in a positive way.

Even the '70s/'80s sci-fi moralizing was REPLICATED in vitro in this film.

I was surprised in that I liked this movie very much. I thought the premise was good, and honestly, can't understand some of the harsh reviews.  It's not a perfect plot -- I figured one element out right away -- but still enjoyed the movie.

I won't go over the storyline.  In fact, try to go in knowing nothing about the movie, and I think you may enjoy it more.  I went in totally blind so didn't know what to expect.  I felt the acting was really good, with Bruce Willis coming off as a very believable main character.  I enjoyed seeing other actors from some of my favorite movies and felt everyone gave a good performance.  I wish James Cromwell could have had more scenes.  Many complaints about the movie is too little character development, but I liked the way the story unfolded with minimal info.  I think it played better in this movie.

3994130,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"""Surrogates"" is a futuristic tale of divided identity, treachery, and murder.  Based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, ""Surrogates"" stars Bruce Willis as FBI agent Tom Greer, who lives in a world where robotic surrogates stand in for people, protecting them from violence, disease, and the appearance of aging.  These picture- perfect replicants -- fit, good-looking, remotely controlled machines that assume their operator's life role -- enable the population to experience life vicariously from the comfort and safety of their own homes, giving a sci-fi spin to the notion of ""couch potato.""
 Greer and partner Agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) are called in to investigate the mysterious death of a college student whose life ended when his surrogate was destroyed.  When Greer's surrogate is damaged in the investigation, he ventures out of his apartment for the first time in decades.  He must decide who is real and who can be trusted.
 Now that James Cameron has provided movie the final word on human duplicates in ""Avatar,"" the subject may not resonate as dramatically in ""Surrogates,"" but it's a well-made action picture with Willis center stage in his familiar lone-warrior stance.  The theme harks back to one that Stanley Kubrick used memorably in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- depending too much on technology can have dire consequences.  Despite the fact that ""Surrogates"" takes place in the future, the world depicted by director Jonathan Mostow resembles a contemporary city, but the combination of sci-fi, action flick, and mystery work well and provide an entertaining ride.
 DVD bonus extras include director commentary and the music video ""I Will Not Bow"" by Breaking Benjamin.  The Blu-ray edition contains these and the featurettes ""A More Perfect You: The Science of Surrogates"" and ""Breaking the Frame: A Graphic Novel Comes to Life,"" and four deleted scenes.",1264636800,26,1902,5.247524752475248

The premise was an interesting one and I liked some of the ways that things played out, but a few movies are beginning to overlap in my mind and show just how cyclical Hollywood is. The Gamer has the ""controlling actions"" that remind me of the Sims in some ways, and the idea behind this did that to me as well. It didn't help that there were some powerhouse names associated with the movie and that they couldn't redeem the project, either, leading me from the land of plenty to the land of ""what the -.""

As the movie began, I was there and wondering exactly what had happened. I was also wondering about the technological aspects of things, and the way that some things didn't fit well with others. As one reviewer noted, people drove around in junky cars all the time and yet there was this technology that allowed people to have their own Surrogates kicking it around town.
Confusing? Well, other parts of the movie do that as well.

The bad thing was that the movie did like to make fun of its own concept, seemingly not really into the whole ""we are the future"" idea. This made me wonder about some things I saw, namely those that did not really offer up explanations. There are ways around that, too, simply ignoring the fact and saying ""in the future, this is how things are."" That doesn't happen, though, and the loopholes in the movie are astounding.

Should you watch it? You might enjoy the movie and you might not, but you will see the things that are obviously broken. Those little pieces are what hurts the movie, not to mention some slow ""who is behind this nefarious plot"" kinda stuff that make me a little tired. It wasn't baffling, wasn't hard to figure out, and it didn't leave me wanting more. Anything that was asked made me ask more as well, and that's never good.

That said it does help if you don't totally insult the viewers intelligience along the way, especially if you want the film to be taken seriously. And ""Surrogates"" wants to be taken seriously. So much so that I found myself laughing throughout.

The premise of ""Surrogates"" is this. The world has become a dangerous place so a greedy corporation has created surrogates to walk the earth while their real human counterparts stay safely inside hooked up to machines controlling the surrogates actions. So the surrogates work, shop, club....do everything humans once used to do. Of course the surrogates are more beautiful versions of their human counterparts, except for Bruce Willis who obviously has no sense of style since he picked the worst hairdo ever. But anyway who wouldn't rather stay cooped up at home hooked up to some machine while your robotic better half does everything else? Well not everyone obviously as inner-city ""reservations"" have been created for those who condemn surrogates. Instead of the clean and beautiful surrogate world that surrounds them you have dirty, filthy violent slums filled with ugly people. Ghastly!

Yep I'm still laughing, but not in a good way. Not only does this film take itself way too seriously, it's as bland and formulaic as can be. The writing is just dreadful. The plot predictable. The action forgettable. In fact my only lasting memory of this film will be the bad hair of Bruce Willis' surrogate.",1264464000,,1589,4.992452830188679
3994136,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"In 2009, the film ""Surrogates"" directed by Jonathan Mostow (""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"", ""U-571') and starring Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"" film, ""Sin City"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"") was released in theaters.

An adaptation of the five issue comic book series of the same name by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele featured top notch special effects and the film budgeted at $80 million received mix reviews and made only $60 million worldwide.

Despite failing short of breaking even, the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on Jan. 26th.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Surrogates"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Picture quality is actually quite interesting because a lot of the special effects went into making the surrogates look not like actual humans.  Director Jonathan Mostow explains how they purposely removed any blemishes, acne from the skin of the surrogates and with that being the case, you don't really see too many actual humans in this film (until the end).  We see Bruce Willis in his young CG-enhanced surrogate look but then you see the current, older Bruce Willis with the hair stubble, blood on his face, grime on his face.

Some scenes have quite a bit of detail such as a scene when the military arrive at the Dread compound, the CG detail of the robot/surrogates.  But overall, there is a lot of CG in the film but one of the best scenes is the destruction caused in downtown Boston.  That is an actual shot and not CG'd.  People and destroyed vehicles scattered around.

Overall, some people may wonder if the scenes were DNR'd (Digital Noise Reduction) but they weren't.  This was intentionally done to separate what a surrogate looks like versus a human.  Found no artifacts or combing.  Blacks were nice and deep.  But for the most part, ""Surrogates"" looks good but some may feel it had too much special effects and CG.  But personally, the technology, special effect fit the film's theme quite nicely.

As for lossless audio, ""Surrogates"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit) and French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  ""Surrogates"" utilizes a lot of sound effects due to the action scenes.  Crashing cars, helicopters, gun shots, booms, broken glass, motorcycle engine revving and more.  The film's dialogue is understandable and clear through the center channel, music score is clear through the fronts and great use of LFE and the surround channels for the sound effects.  Especially how audio pans from various directions.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Surrogates"" comes with the following special features presented in 1080p, English5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital and optional subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.

  * Audio Commentary by Director Jonathan Mostow - Director Jonathan Mostow gives viewers insight on the scenes of the film, the challenges of making this film and using so many special effects, working with the talents and more.  A pretty informative and enjoyable commentary.
  * Deleted Scenes - (6:03) A total of four deleted scenes: Dread Encounter, Apologies & Theories, What You're Looking At and The Real Peters.
  * A More Perfect You: The Science of Surrogates - (14:34) A look at the advancement of technology and robots in society.  From helping those who are utilizing the technology for medical reasons to helping those with disabilities, utilization in the military and how far we are technology-wise at this current time.  But also asking ourselves if this science does become available, do we accept it or change it before it becomes something like what is featured in the film ""Surrogates"".
  * Breaking the Frame: A Graphic Novel Comes to Life - (6:33) A look at how ""Surrogates"" became a comic book by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, bringing the film adaptation to life and getting Bruce Willis to play the main character role.
  * ""I Will Not Bow"" Music Video by Breaking Benjamin - (3:49)

JUDGMENT CALL:

A film with an intriguing concept that focuses less on the characters and moreso on the overall action.

When it comes to the overall theme of ""Surrogates"", personally its a subject that I'm quite fascinated with.  I've read about robotics in Japanese culture from its earlier years to its present stage and how various societies use the technology.  But at the same time, being intrigued about how tied we are to the Internet, especially those who are addicted to MMORPG's to social media.

You know that there is that next step with technology and we've seen several interpretations of it in shows such as ""Star Trek"" to animated series such as "".Hack/Sign"".  But ""Surrogates"" definitely gives us an idea of a distant future, especially as technology and the military come together in finding ways to limit the loss of life.  So, the concept of ""Surrogates"" is quite intriguing to me.

As for the film, I enjoyed the action and the concept but the film has its problems in terms of storyline especially when it comes to the character of older Canter (played by James Cromwell) and his motivations.  Also, the weapon that was being utilized and how Stone (played by Boris Kodjoe) is connected.  At 89 minutes, there could have been 5-10 minutes fleshing out character development for certain characters.  But Because of this, certain parts of the plot seem to farfetched.  It would have been great to see more of this hostility between humans and the surrogates (as shown in the deleted scenes).

But the film's saving grace is Bruce Willis along with Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike.  Rosamund Pike definitely brings the emotional aspect while both Bruce Willis and Radha are part of the action.  Bruce Willis was effective for the role of Greer and this is an action-based popcorn flick.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Surrogates"" looks very good and sounds fantastic in HD.  But I wished there were additional features with an interview with the cast but also a more in-depth special feature on the creation of the special effects.  For a film that was special effects heavy, it would have been nice to see something incorporated to show how certain scenes and the look of the film were done.

Overall, ""Surrogates"" is an entertaining film that has a message which works.  It's just that its execution was a bit off and possibly not going all action but showing some of the character depth via scenes explaining or showing motivation, that would have been nice to see.  But in the end, ""Surrogates"" was an enjoyable, action film with an interesting concept and also showing us that as an action star, Bruce Willis still has it!",1264464000,30,6605,4.939201451905626
3994137,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Our story takes place in a world where almost all people live their lives through robots.  These surrogates are completely controllable through sensory controls.  And the humans never have to leave their homes to live a full, rich life.  After all, if your surrogate dies, you just need to buy a new one.

Canter (James Francis Gintv) is a college student taking a break and visiting Boston.  Outside a club, he and his new pickup are stunned by an electric gadget.  Since crime of all kinds has been virtually eliminated, this is shocking.

Enter FBI agents Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell).  As they begin tracking down the killer, they discover that the hosts of these two surrogates have been killed as well.  Plus, Canter was the son of Dr. Canter (James Cromwell), the inventor of surrogates.  Could one of the cells of human hold outs be behind this horrid crime?

As a mystery, this story was rather good.  There were some obvious plot elements, but a few twists caught me off guard as well.  The final twists were a little rushed, and I had to sort through who did what to whom and why after the movie was over.  In thinking about it afterward, I realized there was a plot hole, and I was left wondering why the villain didn't go about his plan in some other way.

Visually, the movie was great.  The surrogates looked porcelain and just a tad too perfect, while the humans looked run down.  This played into the theme and helped differentiate the humans from the surrogates.  The movie wasn't loaded with special effects, but the ones we had were great.

The problem with the script is that is emphasized the story over everything else.  The characters were mostly flat, and the few attempts at development were little more than cliches.  Heck, some of the background information given to us was just dropped along the way.  As a result, I felt the theme, which could have been great, was underdeveloped.  No, I don't need to be beaten over the head with it, but a little more on the characters would have made it very powerful.

I enjoyed the story, and am glad I saw it.  But I do wish the characters had been stronger to truly pull me in.",1264464000,,2167,4.551813471502591
3994138,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"Surrogates - Touchstone

Bruce Willis has been lucky to have continuous career in Hollywood, with as many ups and downs as you can imagine, and it is in the action movies that he has been able to prevail. Whether or not that's good for him, you need to ask the star. The very exciting ""Surrogates"" should be another triumph for Willis. It is smart and engrossing entertainment, two of the reasons of why I go to the movies for.

The story takes place in the city of San Diego, California, somewhere in the present or the near future. Science has evolved to a point in which robots are now a reality, and are part of society. They are referred to as surrogates, and they are the ones doing all the work, which keeps the country going. The owners, meanwhile, stay home, connected to machines that monitor and record their surrogates every move. Of course, there are people against this way of life. They live in areas known as Human Coalition Reservations, in which surrogates are not accepted.

Bruce Willis is FBI agent Tom Greer, who partners with beautiful Peters (Rhada Mitchell). Both of them stay home, while their surrogates do the actual police work. One day, the surrogate of the son of Canter (James Cromwell), the man who created the surrogate system, is assassinated. However, by killing the surrogate, its actual owner (Canter's son) also dies. This is unusual, and Greer and Peters - their surrogates, that is - are sent to investigate. Unfortunately, while trying to rescue the weapon that is capable of killing both owners and surrogates from the criminals, Greer's surrogate is destroyed. This forces the real Tom Greer to get out of his apartment to solve the crime, an endeavor that may change the course of mankind.

Director Jonathan Mostow did a superb job in recreating the surrogate society, aided by the fantastic futurist cinematography of Oliver Wood. Willis is remarkable in acting both as a human and as a surrogate, although at the beginning, when you see Willis for first time, you can't help but ask yourself, ""Why the hell is Willis using that silly hairstyle?"" It turns out that we are looking at the surrogate, which makes perfect sense. The surrogates are much better looking that their actual owners, who, most of the times, look unhealthy and unhappy.  This is another fascinating look at what can be our future, which kept me glued to the screen to the very end. It also kept me thinking afterwards. The DVD also includes audio commentary by the director and a music video by Breaking Benjamin. (USA, 2009, color, 89 min plus additional materials)

3994139,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"""Surrogates"" is a sci-fi action thriller starring Bruce Willis as FBI agent Thomas Greer investigating a strange murder case in the near future utopian world, where all you have to do is sit comfortably in an isolated space. Any works and social activities are done through the interactions using ""Surrogates,"" humanoid robots you can control from wherever you are. It's like old pop song: ""Some machine's doin' that for you.""

Sadly, in spite of its interesting idea, ""Surrogates"" directed by Jonathan Mostow (""U-571"" ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"") doesn't really know it wants to do. As noir-like murder mystery, the film is weak with forgettable characters; as sci-fi thriller, it lacks details and leaves many questions unanswered. Only Bruce Willis' charisma as the reluctant hero makes the film watchable.

""Surrogates"" is penned by the writers John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris, a team whose previous works include ""The Net,"" ""The Game,"" and the third and fourth ""Terminator"" installments. Their new sci-fi thriller depicts the futuristic world after the ""Rise of the (Surrogate) Machines,"" but the film doesn't tell us much about how the surrogate technology is received, accepted and finally embraced by most of the population. The film's premise (which may remind us of ""The Avatar"") is intriguing, but unlike James Cameron film, it doesn't convince.

But what is more disappointing is the conventional storytelling and huge plot holes. Supporting actors are all wasted as the stock-type characters. And those characters, it seems, can use such advanced technologies of ""Surrogates,"" but don't have a decent security system at their home or office. There is one nice action sequence nearly at the end of the film, but it arrives too late.

""Surrogates"" is a passable entertainment with a strong performance from the star Bruce Willis.",1264118400,,1853,5.271186440677966
3994140,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Aside from the loads of critics out there that have found the hundreds of reasons this movie is poor to average, the overlaying entertainment value icon still exists in Willis - and in the end that is why I have people still asking for it (even though they have all heard how poorly this did). Judging from the low revenue in theaters I was afraid they were going to skimp on the BD, which essentially they did but overall it still provides some thrills for the Bruce fans.

The Blu clarity is a mixed bag, with a few reference scenes during exterior landscapes. The interior and dialogue scenes are very mixed, with the night time effects shots looking somewhat fake to the heavy makeup/CGI faces looking worse than (I think) intended. Pause checking a variety of scenes showed some random artifact and grain, but once you watch the deleted scenes you will see how much clean-up work was done. The DTS gets some nice usage, with a spattering of action scenes, music and dialogue spread throughout the channels. The supplements are mostly uneventful but in one case nice to see, including: (the top 3 are ""exclusive"" to Blu, bottom two are the only supplements on the DVD)

* Science & Technology of Surrogates, 15:08 minutes. A mix of interviews and footage from leading scientists/entrepreneurs regarding the possibilities of the technology seen in the film. Is mixed with a few cast quips and footage from the film. Covers more about stuff that might happen than behind the scenes of the film.
* Graphic Novel, 6:39 minutes. A look into the minds behind the original illustrations/novel. I have never been a fan of putting the exact pages on the screen with random voiceovers. Gives some brief insight into how this story came to be though.
* Deleted scenes, 4 cuts totaling 6 minutes (BD menu states 5:08 but came out to 6:12 - all in lodef). Wish all of them would have stayed in - they helped add some emotionality and fill some plot holes, and there are a TON of holes in this film.
* Music video, Breaking Benjamin playing I Will Not Burn.
* Commentary track by Mostow.

Normally a film with that many issues (writing, plot gaps, bad editing - there were so many gaffes in this I tried not to count) and of average Blu quality would rate lower, but Bruce plays his two roles well and Ms. Pike (to me one of the prettiest ladies in the industry right now) adds some needed emotion - that I rated this up to four total.

3994141,5,B002UZCJ8Y,"Short Attention Span Summary (abbreviated in the interest of keeping the review readable):

1. We find out that everyone in the world can have robots that will go out and work in their place. (""Surrogates."")
2. A guy's surrogate goes out to a club and is killed-- but the device that killed him also was able to fry the brain of (and kill) the Surrogate User.
3. This launches an investigation into the nature of the weapon and who developed it and who killed it.
4. It turns out that the original inventor of the surrogates started the plot to take down the company that fired him (after they used the work that he created).
5. The surrogates all die because of a technical glitch (it was either that or watch their Surrogate User killed) and everyone has to go back to living life as a normal human being.

Comments:

The makeup/ wardrobe in this film was great. The director showed us the striking contrast between what people actually looked like vs. what their surrogates looked like at the very beginning of the film and then returned to develop the idea very subtly in later parts of the film. So, for example, the attractive female surrogate at the club really belonged to a very fat, ugly white man.  The people at the Reservation (people who refused to accept surrogates) were actually disporportionately fat and ugly (cast to look like real people). There were also several other instances of people's surrogates looking much better than the actual person.

On some parts: They goofed a bit. Can someone really believe that Bruce Willis' surrogate survived a helicopter crash and lost an arm to track down a criminal only to get right back up and chase down a criminal-- but then Ving Rhames' surrogate dies from a single bullet to the chest? Can we really be expected to believe that there was a colony of humans who didn't want surrogates-- but was really led by a surrogate and didn't know that he was one (Rhames)?

There were also some potential ""discussion topics"" from the movie. ""If you could live life through a surrogate, would you?"" and so on.

This is worth a trip to the theater or a purchase off the New Release shelf.",1263513600,2,2143,4.608923884514436
3994142,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Honestly, I've forgotten most of SURROGATES already. Let me see what I can dredge up. Bruce Willis is an FBI agent in a future where almost everyone has a tele-operated robotic double. These robots are called SURROGATES, and they can look however you want them to look. Bruce's looks younger and has Don Johnson's hair. The idea is that no one leaves home anymore. Their SURROGATES do that. So when Bruce's surrogate takes a bullet, no sweat. It's just a robot. Only someone has a weapon that fry both the surrogate and the operator. Bruce has to stop him.

But, the problem is that SURROGATES is boring, and you see the ending coming miles and miles away. It felt like the David Brin novel, The Kiln People, although in that book, the SURROGATES were disposable clones. But the stories are similar.

To call SURROGATES science fiction is really just a technicality. The premise certainly is Sci-Fi, but their future looks awfully contemporary. And there was no guessing who the final five were - EVERYONE was a robot. Or so we're told. There were no outward signs of that. They didn't even append an `r' to the front of their names.

I have managed to remember more, but it was hardly worth the effort. SURROGATES is a movie to watch when there is nothing else on. NOT RECOMMENDED.",1263340800,,1282,4.638766519823789

It's sci-fi, has a little bit of action, somewhat thought provoking, Matrix meets iRobot, and has a less than memorable script. The character development isn't important enough to really harp on the acting and the story is somewhat predictable. It's a middle-of-the-road movie.

3994144,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"In the future, people stay safely indoors, while they live their lives through their Surrogates, the robotic images of who they wish they were: young, pretty, and popular.  Surrogates are the brainchild of Dr. Canter (James Cromwell, the go-to guy for genius inventors), but when Canter's son is murdered while hooked up to his Surrogate, the world must face a realization: society is in for yet another change, and this one promises to be a violent one.

Bruce Willis, as the cop who tries to get to the source of the problem, turns in a solid performance; as does Cromwell, although he has so little to work with, it's almost a tragedy.  Ving Rhames, as the leader of a group of anti-Surrogate people, is reduced to caricature; a shame, since he's such a great actor.  Rosamund Pike, as Willis's wife (or, rather, her Surrogate, for she is rather addicted to the technology), is so wooden, we can't help but wince; granted, she's playing a robot, but still...

""Surrogates"" is based off a graphic novel, and as such I will be reading the novel when I get the chance.  The premise behind the film truly is outstanding; but then, the same could be said about ""I, Robot,"" to which this film draws many (unfavorable) comparisons.  In both instances, we have a pretty decent--sometimes great--actor playing the sane man in an insane world, surrounded by friends and loved ones who criticize him for his reliance on the past.  Such concepts contain the promise of social commentary, but ""Surrogates"" never quite gets there; instead, it's basically a slam-bang action thriller with an ending you can see coming a mile away, but some interesting special effects and a performance by Bruce Willis that make it worth a viewing or two.",1262476800,,1726,4.8074324324324325

3994146,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"The opening scene in Surrogates is something that stuck out to me, seeing as I am a sucker for faux-documentary style openings. Basically the first 10 minutes are done in a documentary style, to sort of introduce the surrogate technology and the setup of the movie. Then we leap into the conventional movie style. As good as the opening was, I also felt it was striving too hard for the realism of my favorite movie of the summer 09, District 9.

WIllis stars in the movie, and if you've read the comic book you probably know what the movie's about- this humanoid technology named Surrogates, who promote a glamorous lifestyle. However, there seems to be something fishy about these so called surrogates- a man died after his surrogate got blasted away by a ray gun. This calls Willis to solve the mystery of the Surrogates.

I will admit I rather liked the movie. It was fast paced and interesting to watch, especially with the action scenes and the suspense. Willis turns in a phenomenal acting performance, maybe his best since The Sixth Sense. The movie plot is pretty unoriginal though, which is what prevents the movie from getting anything above 3 stars. But with that aside, some great action and special effects made for an entertaining movie. 3/5.

The first time i went to see it i was high off my mind. then i thought id give it another go so this time i went sober. it was still quite possiably one of the worst movies i could have ever seen. im glad that i wasted 10.50 to see everything that was in the trailer. Go watch the trailer and if your not LOVING and i mean LOVING the trailer then do not even waste your time because i promise you, you will be very disappointed.

3994149,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"First off, I'm happy to say that Surrogates was much better than I thought it would be. I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but I was bored one day and the reviews hadn't been too harsh. There is a lot more going on here than in most of the mindless drivel that comes out in the month of September. Sure there are some nifty action scenes, but this movie plays more like a drama with sci-fi elements and some thought provoking ideas on humanity. It's a little slow at times, but at around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Bruce Willis is solid here as usual. Nothing really special from him, but he's still the guy we know and love. The supporting cast features two beautiful women in Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike. Not only are they nice to look at, they make the most of the limited material they are given. I thought it was pretty funny how the filmmakers made all the actors so attractive as the robots and went out of their way to make them as ugly as possible in human form. Except for Bruce Willis curiously, who just looked flat out creepy as a Surrogate. Ving Rhames and James Cromwell add name recognition to the cast and perform rather well in their small roles.

The SFX are good at times and lacking at others, but nothing too bad or distracting. There is one neat twist I didn't see coming and the ending felt just right. Not too optimistic or depressing. I saw Gamer a few weeks ago and it shares a lot of similarities with this one, but Surrogates is a much stronger film with bigger ideas. I wouldn't rush out to see it, but this flick is worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed I, Robot or The Island.",1259366400,2,1642,4.327922077922078
3994150,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"It's kind of depressing to constantly have so many sci-fi films in the multiplexes and never a good one. Take this latest example of average, middling mediocrity. The idea is always a good hook. This time humans have abandoned their daily lives to robots called surrogates. The surrogates live the person's life while the person is hooked into a machine in the comfort of their own home and interact with the world through their surrogate. Why is this cool idea forced upon us in the plot structure of a police procedural/murder mystery, with evil corporate machinations/anti-technology groups trying to sabotage the surrogacy program and Bruce Willis running around jumping, kicking butt Die-Hard style with car chases, helicopter crashes, explosions/action sequences ripped righ out of Terminator 3 which itself was ripped out of Terminator 2 which was ripped out of The Terminator.

In case that diatribe made no sense, I was saying there is nothing original in this movie and it's a rehash of earlier ideas and stories as well as all the trappings of your typical big-budget commercial spectacle. It's really terrible to see the director, a once promising Jonathan Mostow, actually rip off action scenes from his own movies, films still fresh in the mind. Radha Mitchell's character in this movie is jumping on cars like the TX in Terminator 3 and so is Bruce Willis.

I suppose this is enjoyable dreck on some level and there is plenty of humor involved when it comes to what a world like this would be like. Consumer commodity madness at it's worst. But it's been done to death in far more ambitious and intellectual films such as Blade Runner. Someone mentioned the similarities between Surrogates and I-Robot. I agree, both films are dumb sci-fi and that's all we can expect.",1256774400,,1783,4.959866220735786
3994151,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"Surrogates is a movie with a really interesting premise and a really nice cast and the most uninspired, lackluster, rehashed story I've seen in a science fiction film lately. Luckily, it has a really interesting premise!

The story sets us in a near future world where no one leaves their house, instead opting to hook their brain up to a machine that allows them to telepathically connect to a synthetic body that goes out into the world. This saves everybody the hassles of catching diseases, having to use energy, getting maimed or killed, etc. Also, of course, the synthetic body does not look like its operater, instead being either a beautiful representation of themselves, or a completely different person or gender altogether. A person's bodily image becomes precisely what they desire.

Naturally, something so idyllic yet strange has detractors, and the plot follows Bruce Willis as a detective as he attempts to track down a weapon that is capable of frying the synthetic surrogates in a way that traces back the line and at the same time kills the operators.

So we have a seemingly utopian society with obvious flaws under threat and a man who is not sure what side he is on really unravelling the mystery up to an unexcitedly predictable ending.

I guess I wasn't paying attention well enough since going into this I thought it was a scifi action film. I misunderstood something since there are no real action sequences, although there are a couple of chases that are more plotpoints than action sequences. So action does not come in and pick Surrogates up by its bootstraps to become a better film.

In the end, it was pretty boring. It was fascinating to watch the actors pretend to be synthetic bodies, often not moving entirely naturally and little things like that. And the idea itself, while treading very close to The Matrix and others of that ilk, does lend itself to a lot of imaginative possibilities, many of which are actually touched upon in the film.

If you dig scifi, and think the premise is cool go ahead and watch it. You won't find any reason to watch it ever again, but you won't regret having seen it the one time either.",1256601600,3,2157,4.723404255319149

This movie borrows quite a lot story-wise from I-Robot, though that was a much better film. Though unlike I-Robot, where robots were used basically by corporate America, in this film everyday people have a ""surrogate"" that carries out their day to day functions. The original inventor intended this to be a chance for those that were sick or handicapped to live a fulfilling life as a ""normal"" person. However, the technology has run amuck and now people have become overly-dependent on their surrogates, never leaving their own homes or in some cases their own bed it seems.

The story is rather slow developing and it really took me about half of the movie until I was finally somewhat interested in the story. However, the ending though it was a twist I didn't foresee, was none-the-less unsatisfying. So the point of the film is to tell us that we are or will be too dependent on technology in the future? I'm not sure why so many of these ""sci fi"" films end up finding all the possible faults of technology rather than the good. I'm sitting here writing this review of this film and anyone with an Internet connection the world over, who can read English can read what I'm writing. Oh yeah, that technology is REAL evil and must be destroyed!

Annoyances with the film's ""message"" aside, another major pitfall to the film is the acting. This is not a good role for Bruce Willis and he seems out of sorts here. And the supporting acting isn't much better or memorable.

All in all it's a decent film though I was disappointed by the movie's ""anti-technology"" ending. Final grade: C+",1256342400,,1618,4.686619718309859
3994153,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"Surrogates (Jonathan Mostow, 2009)

September 2009 is going to be remembered not as a particularly bad month for movies, but a month in which many movies with a great deal of potential got released. All of them, or at least all of them that I have seen, have been spectacular failures when measured up against the potential of their collective premises; in that light, Surrogates is far less of a disappointment than it would have been had I not already seen such highlights as Pandorum.

Bruce Willis, who's doing just as good/bad a job at clinging to his action-star days as is Nicolas Cage, plays Tom Greer, an FBI Agent who finds himself with the unenviable task of tracking down the first murderer in five years. You see, most people are basically unkillable these days; 98% of the population stays at home, wired into the net, interacting with the rest of society through he use of surrogates (think androids here). While there are some other folks in this movie you'll recognize--Ving Rhames plays the leader of the anti-surrogate band known as the Dreads, while Radha Mitchell plays Willis' partner, as a sampling--this movie lives and dies on the character of Tom Greer.

And that is its major problem. Bruce Willis is almost comatose throughout most of this movie. Calling his performance ""flat affect"" would be a kindness. Kind of makes sense when he's tooling around in a plastic body, and that would work, but during the time when he's actually wandering around as a human, he doesn't get any more emotional. (Worse, Greer-the-surrogate is actually more emotional than most of his compatriots, which makes the distinction even more blurry.) Rhames, as he's been doing in many roles recently, seems to be playing everything camp, going way, way over the top every time he's on screen. (Normally that would annoy me, but both in Day of the Dead last year and here, it allows him to steal the show.) There are some wonderful ideas here, and a few of them are actually carried off (I loved the asides about people slipping into cheaper surrogates without as many features), but the main thrust of the film never achieves ignition. It ends up being a long sting of mindless action sequences tied together by far too few pieces of film that looked like they were from another movie--one that was worth your time. **",1255478400,3,2322,4.785536159600998

The mysteries that were in the movie were solved about 10 seconds after the question popped into my head, so the whole thing regularly seemed pretty elementary compared to what it could have been.

A+: for an awesome idea (sci-fi soup-up of the ""sociology of Chat Room/MMORPG addictions"" issue... i.e. An ""Exploratory Analyses Of The Social Nature Of Internet Addiction"")

A+: for special effects (besides the normal SFX, the Surrogates ""look"" is amazingly well done)

B: for script and acting (the script really held the actors back in more than a few instances and the movie would have been nearly unwatchable with lesser actors.)

F: for character development (many key characters made extremely limited appearances, but hey, it was only 90 minutes long)

D: for overall execution (it could have been so much better)

Over all a 3-star (on 5-star scale) film.  Wait to rent it.  But if you LOVE sci-fi then be sure to rent it when it comes out.  There isn't enough good, non-horror sci-fi to miss this and it is better than a B-rate.",1255132800,,1158,4.688118811881188
3994155,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Simply put, this film is a showcase for Bruce Willis in a completely unoriginal concept.

Suffice to say, the concept of living through alternate means or gaining experiences without sacrifice or danger, having a secondary persona without repercussions, or the simple concept of robot sentience, has been explored ad nauseum.  Director Jonathan Mostow just adds to the nausea.

A corporation named VSI has become nearly globally dominant by creating ""Surrogates,"" realistic robots through which people can plug into the life they desire, without any reservations or hesitations, from the comfort of their own home.  Designed by world-renowned scientist Dr. Lionel Carter (James Cromwell) - who has been removed from VSI's board of directors in recent years - the Surrogates ubiquitously carry out every day life via the thoughts of their virtually moribund humans.  When a new weapon is developed, one that can kill a dormant human via the connection to their Surrogate, FBI Agent Greer (Bruce Willis) and Agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) are on the case - via their Surrogates, of course.  After some investigation and futuristic police work reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B000PC6XDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>, the clues not only lead to sinister links between the influential in the government, military, and politics, but also to the ""Prophet"" (Ving Rhames) led, ghetto-locked resistance movements throughout the country, those who view Surrogates as an abomination and affront to the beauty and reality of humankind.

The lesson(s) of this movie could be taken in many ways.  Some will view this as a religious parable, where humans have encroached upon the boundaries of God's creation and must be purged of their wickedness.  Others may see it as a message of virtual prison, or even a subtle jab at slavery, where the controllers eventually lose dominance over others or their own reality, and eventually become the controlled.  Alternately, however, I view this as a cautionary humanistic tale, one that warns of an ever-increasing disconnect between people, where virtual reality supersedes life.  Human interactivity is at an all time low.  We don't know our neighbors; we order food via cell-phone; we prefer autopay options wherever available versus actually talking to someone.  Perhaps the relationship scarcity will lead towards this reality; after all, isn't every hot woman online actually a naked fat guy sitting in his basement, mouse in one hand, bag of Cheetos in another?",1255132800,,3584,7.190366972477064

People wear masks of various kinds through most of their daily lives, for perfectly good reasons as well as not-so-good ones. Suppose the mask took over, leaving every trace of the actual person behind?

That's where this movie starts, in a world populated almost entirely by who people wish they were instead of who they are. Even within Willis's marriage, he sees only the plastic-perfect version of his wife that he wants seen, not the actual, flesh and blood woman he married.

Willis, as he so often does, plays the role of a police investigator. This time, the investigation starts when someone's plastic public presence is destroyed - no big deal, since killing a remote-controlled robot is only vandalism. Soon, however, it turns out that something terrible has happened, something impossible. The whole world of synthetic presences is under attack without even knowing it. The rest turns into chases, guns, and last minute saves. You know, the usual.

But, as usual, Willis does a pretty good job with the role he's given. This could have been a much more thoguhtful movie, going deeper into the world of hidden people, but it's not that movie. It's good science fiction adventure, with a backdrop of Boston's ""Brutalist"" architecture that fits the bleak mood perfectly.

3994157,4,B002UZCJ8Y,"Let's get a couple of things straight: Surrogates is not a bad movie.  It is not anything like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gamer/dp/B00275EH78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gamer</a>, and yet Rotten Tomatoes has a spread of under 10 points between the two.  This is a crying shame. With Gamer and Surrogates coming out within months of each other, it's almost like Hollywood wanted desperately to make a Second Life movie but realized too late that Second Life is no longer cool.

Surrogates has a lot in common with I, Robot and yes, Gamer. Implausibly, the world is dominated by remote-controlled robots, a parallel to Internet avatars.  Thanks to these robots, known as surrogates, crime is unheard of and the dream of a utopian society beckons. Of course, not everyone is okay with the status quo, including a radical group known as the Dreads. The Dreads are the underclass, people who don't believe in a robot-filled reality. Everyone else has become shut-ins, hiding in their bedrooms in their pajamas, living life through perpetually beautiful twenty-something robots.

FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) investigate a pair of murders in which the operators died too. There's just one problem: there are safeguards to protect operators from being harmed by the death of their surrogates. If word got out that surrogates were not immortal, the social fabric of modern society would fall apart.

On screen, the surrogates are disturbingly perfect.  Their teeth is pearly white, their eyes without any hint of veins, their stubble-free skin cheeks are as rosy as a newborn's.  The robots (and thus, the actors portraying them) only move their heads when they talk, even when angry. Sights and sounds are softly muted. Until the real world hits and Greer is forced to come out of his shell.

Willis' skill playing a sad sack and a scruffy loner are on full display here. Surrogates is as much about the increasing isolation of technology as it is about the wreckage of a marriage. As the stakes get higher, the movie becomes about the broken relationship between a husband and wife who were disconnected from each other long before surrogates were invented.

If along the way it happens to involve some amazing special effects and a lot of cool action sequences, that's not such a bad thing.",1254528000,2,2388,5.1953125
3994158,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"SURROGATES depicts a near-future world where people choose to remain in their homes for safety, interacting with the world through android bodies known as surrogates. The surrogates are not only designed to look better than the actual humans, but any damage to the surrogate has no effect on the owner, who only has to buy a new surrogate. That's until someone creates a weapon that can not only destroy surrogates, but fry the brains of their operators as well. Bruce Willis stars as agent Tom Greer, an FBI agent who must get to the bottom of the first such murder.

This is a fairly standard mix of police procedural with car chances and occasional (but never gratuitous) special effects moments. In spite of its 85 minutes, the film seems rushed, and I expected more fleshing out of the environment of 2017. The end is especially disappointing in this regard, with the credits rolling only a couple of minutes after the climax of the film, with the briefest of resolution. The look of the future seems greatly inspired by MINORITY REPORT, and it's a pity nothing more distinctive was done.

What does make this film an enjoyable romp, however, are the social themes it addresses. A group of humans who reject the use of surrogates has an important role in this film, and it makes one think about the upheavals in store if futurists like Ray Kurzweil are right about the coming singularity.",1254355200,,1393,4.75206611570248
3994159,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"The essential premise behind SURROGATES is interesting, although perhaps not entirely original.  It is the not-too-distant future, but 98% of the human population is living through a surrogate.  These robots do everything for you, AS you.  You can sit in the safety of your chair at home, getting fat and wearing pajamas all day, while your avatar, with a face (even gender) that you've chosen stands in for you.  You see and feel and hear everything...but there's no danger to you if you want to try something crazy.  You'll always look attractive and young.

Thus, in surrogates, no one is quite what they seem.  The 2% of people who refuse to join the ""fun"" live in ramshackle, electronics-free zones scattered around the country.  They live lives that resemble nothing more than hippie colonies...the fact that they not only rejected living through surrogates but apparently ALL forms of technology is never really explained.

They are led by ""The Prophet"" (original name!) who assures them the day of reckoning is coming.  And indeed, when a new weapon arrives on the scene...the new world order appears to be threatened.  This weapon allows its wielder to not only kill surrogates, but to also kill the human who is operating it.

There are many intriguing ideas and concepts (and questions) that this alternate world brings to mind...but SURROGATES is in the end more of a detective movie than a sci-fi movie.  And not a detective movie in BLADE RUNNER tradition (where the detective and his work is a way of delving ever deeper into what it means to live in this alternate society), but more in the I, ROBOT tradition of Will Smith kicking butt and taking names.  But with a lower budget.

SURROGATES has little in the way of truly new ideas, and apart from some randomly scattered amusing moments, doesn't milk much entertainment value from the pure idea of all of us sitting around, getting fat, lazy (and probably smelly) while our surrogates run around looking younger, fitter, sexier and smarter than we do...interacting with other surrogates who look hot but are in reality a stand-in for others who are fat, lazy and smelly.

To go along with lazy ideas are some lazy performances.  Rhada Mitchell plays one of the cops investigating this new weaponry, and it's as if she's taken the robot idea a bit too far...she fails to muster up any emotion, and thus, even though she is a ""co-star,"" she is utterly forgettable.  James Cromwell (as the inventor of surrogates) and Ving Rhames (as The Prophet) phone in their performances, giving us absolutely nothing we've not seen before in previous films.  Rosamund Pike has a small role as the wife of the lead investigator on the case, and she DOES at least show some sparks of emotion and generates a little empathy.

Thus, SURROGATES is at best a 2.5 star movie.  The effects are minimal, but generally convincing.  Action sequences (stage by Jonathan Mostow of TERMINATOR 3) are workmanlike but not actually bad.  Script is uninspired and the acting is uninteresting.

BUT WAIT.  I forgot to mention that the film stars Bruce Willis.  He is the master of elevating the quality of the film around him.  He can turn a very good film into a classic (DIE HARD, SIXTH SENSE) and he can turn a mediocre film into something at least enjoyable for its running time (16 BLOCKS, HOSTAGE).  And this is the service he performs for SURROGATES.  While he's not exactly a GREAT actor in the way we think of folks like Daniel Day Lewis or Robert DeNiro...he is a nearly perfect EVERYMAN.  No one does world-weary better.  In fact, world-weariness is what Willis always starts with, and then he just adds the right amount of smart-ass to the mix.  John McClane in DIE HARD...lots of smart-ass.  His character in TWELVE MONKEYS...only a tiny, tiny drop.  Yet he always knows exactly how much to add.  (Sometime his best efforts can only elevate a 1 star film to 2 stars...see STRIKING DISTANCE...or don't!  Also, this is a skill he's hones over time...some of his earlier work like MORTAL THOUGHTS or THE JACKAL pretty much just stinks.)

Willis is amusing in SURROGATES when he is seen as his surrogate.  Youngish, with a full head of very funny hair.  When the ""real"" Willis emerges, he's the Bruce we know.  Shaved head, scars and that patented world-weariness.  He also gets to show his other skill...the art of really looking like he's getting hurt, yet making us believe he can get up and keep fighting.  Again, John McClane is the archetype...but Willis still owns that trait.  Frankly, he's just a good guy to watch on film.  We like him...easily.  He's not the brightest tool in the shed sometimes, but he has good instincts, a quick wit and is usually a good person just trying to make the best of bad situations.

SURROGATES' script has saddled him with a sadness due to a son who has died years before...but Willis still makes his scenes with his wife (whom he so eagerly wants to wean off her surrogate so they can REALLY be together) touching.

Thus, thanks to Willis, the film is a solid 3.5 stars.  But for the overall lack of originality, I'll be treating that like 3.49 stars and rounding down to 3.",1254268800,113,5161,4.752530933633296

We really enjoy Bruce Willis and in most of his movies, and find that we usually get very invested in the character. In this movie, I think his character could have been a bit more well developed. Also, the ""bad guy"" in this movie could have been much more well developed. The script was missing that element in a great movie that makes you sit on the edge of your seat - that thing that makes you really care about what happens to the characters, feel what they feel and want to see them come out on top.

Imagine a world in the future where surrogate robots are readily available to much of the population, probably middle-income and above.  The robots often even look like you, unless you want something different.  They look pretty much human, unless you tear a piece of skin and see robot-matter.

Now, let's say that you have a debilitating injury.  Maybe you are a parapalegic and confined to a wheelchair since a bad accident.  Or maybe you are severly scarred and you don't want people to see you like that.  Maybe you are just unhappy with your appearance.  Maybe you want to keep your FBI-Agent job, but you can't run like you used to.  You can have a young, vibrant ""you"" act out the rest of your life.  As a matter of fact, your surrogate can run and leap and do things beyond the human scope.  If you are a woman, your surrogate can act out for you at 25 or 30 again.  (No, they did not discuss sex in the movie so I don't know the answer to that part, so don't ask me.:-)  You surrogate stays in a stand-up charging station when not in use.  To activate, you lay/sit, put these glasses on, and activate the surrogate.  Some people use the surrogate so much that they have no ""real"" life anymore.  They just live life through the surrogate.  As a matter of fact, that's pretty much all you see everywhere is the surrogate version of the person.

Is this a good thing or a bad thing?  A technology that was originally intended to help folks with severe disabilities has become available to most people and has taken over their life (by their choice).  Well, some people think it's a bad thing and want to rid the world of surrogates.

When the son of the creator of surrogates is killed, it sets off a chain of events that causes Willis to go out into the world again to solve a deepening mystery that involves the corporation that creates most of the surrogates, the creator of the surrogates, who has turned against surrogacy, and the leader of the anti-surrogacy movement, played by Ving Rhames.

The movie is intelligent, well-acted, and thought provoking. The end solves lots of problems, but also leaves lots of questions that shouldn't have to be asked. It is an entertaining film, but it could have been better without the plot issues.",1253923200,,1169,4.928934010152284
3994163,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"Remember many years ago when people didn't have the use of cell phones and now it seems like we can't get by without having one? Well, the comic book adapted sci-fi action thriller ""SURROGATES"" does take a little stab at that idea; but in this case, it is the use of artificial beings engineered to make our lives easier. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571), the film based on a screenplay by Michael Ferris and John Broncato, the film feels a little of a mixed bag in my book. The film captures the backdrop of the comic book by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele but misses its message. There have been major alterations to the graphic novel's story that gave it a more crowd-pleasing atmosphere.

Several years ago, a scientist named Dr. Lionel Canter (James Francis Ginty/ later played by James Cromwell) has invented a ""Surrogates"" robotic technology that can allow injured people independent mobility, soldiers go to the battlefield without risking their lives, among other applications. Since then, for the sake of profit, VSI has adapted the technology for commercial use where regular people can use the robots as avatars to do their daily routine. The look of the life-like robot would depend on the preferences of the user, as well as certain on-board enhancements and features that can make one's job a little more easier to do while the `operator` is safe in one`s own home (example: a police surrogate would be faster, stronger and more maneuverable than the average model). When an important surrogate is destroyed and its operator killed with it with a special military weapon, FBI agent Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) is sent in to investigate. Following its clues and his surrogate destroyed by firearms, agent Greer enters the community where humans have opted out of the `surrogate' use under the leadership of a charismatic prophet (Ving Rhames) and must now face the everyday perils without his ""buffer""; that includes his own wife (played by Rosamund Pike)...

Being adapted from the graphic novel, the movie ""Surrogates"" looks very sharp and I am pretty sure director Mostow intended the film to capture the tone of the comic. The work in photography and the visual effects are pretty good (but some looked better than others) and the film is nicely shot. Mostow uses some visual enhancements so that ""surrogates"" can be distinguished from the actual human being; they have near silky like skin, somewhat emotionless eyes, and very nice features. The film's screenplay revolves around this network of `surrogates', the tension and mystery slowly unraveling as the film makes the viewer ponder just what is ethical and which is not in the use of the artificial beings? What is the balance between technological advancements and emotional detachments? Is life worth living through the electronic eyes of a robot or should life be experienced first hand?

The film does manage to touch upon the lost of identity when in the use of such technology. People use them to stay safe, be successful and sometimes to feed their own vanity without risks to themselves. I liked the way ""Surrogates"" manages to bring the doubts brought about without actual human contact, much like today's internet age that would make one wonder if the face behind the picture is the same. How do you know if a sexy female surrogate is controlled by an actual woman? Well, agent Greer and his wife, Maggie have models that looked very similar to their actual features. Maggie (played by Rosamund Pike) has gone into emotional seclusion after the loss of their son and has allowed her surrogate to take over all their daily routine. John Greer is longing to feel his own wife's attention and love. Their relationship is made almost immaterial, after all, would a wife be cheating if her surrogate is the one who sleeps with another surrogate?

Director Mostow does have the right ideas in mind, but certain themes are only touched upon but abandoned in favor for the `whodunit' mystery and conspiracy theories at its core. It was obvious that the film was adapted to please the audiences of the multiplexes; while this isn't exactly a bad thing, it does present a lot of missed opportunities in the screenplay. I liked certain parts of the mystery and the film's ideas about `atonement', but deep down the film feels more like an action film than an actual sci-fi thriller whose story revolves around the concept of the losing `touch' and its emotional repercussions. There is a compelling tale around here, sadly its powerful social commentary gets lost amid the action and the mystery behind this `weapon'. This mystery while interesting at first, gets a little too clichd. The potential for the `surrogate' feels more like fragmented story pieces and used only as a backdrop than a real integral part of the film. I sure wished that the relationship between Greer and his wife, and their son's loss be more fleshed out; as well as how other people are coping with this technology. It really bothered me that the movie changed several things from the graphic novel. Also, the film doesn't make a compelling argument as to why such a technology be so accepted and can go so mainstream around the world. I guess director Mostow is trying to tell his audience not to be lazy or afraid; he gets the point across but not as convincing or as dramatic as I would've wished.

""Surrogates"" does have some decent action sequences. I guess to compensate, Mostow tries to overload the screen with enough PG-13 violence as he could possibly fit into the film. I liked the scenes with chase with the ""Peters"" surrogate and the Greer ""surrogate"" was definitely cool while on pursuit mode. When it comes to rehearsed visual effects, explosions and style, the film doesn't disappoint. However, the film's resolution was never in doubt, and the film does fall into the usual trappings of sci-fi action thrillers. Bruce Willis does feel a little out of his element at times but he had enough charisma to pull off his role. I guess the supporting cast wasn't so bad, although most of them were acting like emotionless `surrogates'.

""Surrogates"" has enough things going for it that the film manages to take off. I guess while I tempered my expectations, I still couldn't ignore the fact that it missed its potential for raw emotions, and for a film that is supposed to be humanity's detachment from life, it felt a little too mechanical and hollow. The film is decent, if you look at it from a popcorn film standpoint, but ""Surrogates"" should be a lot more than that. The film should have been strong in pitching several issues about our reliance to technology, and on this, the film falters. Changing several key elements (especially the climax) from the graphic novel made the film pretty mechanical and never realizes the humanity behind the story.

3994164,2,B002UZCJ8Y,"Based on a graphic novel series, ""Surrogates"" has an intriguing and thoroughly believable premise: that technology will soon progress to the point where human beings no longer need to risk facing the world in their own skin.  Instead, remote controlled robotic surrogates have been universally adopted: enabling individuals to navigate through daily life using stronger, better looking, sexier versions of themselves.  Anyone can portray themselves as whomever they wish, living whatever kind of life they want to lead, living their life through idealized proxies.

The premise of the film is dead-on in terms of what is technologically feasible within the not too distant future; and it's disturbing: what depths of dysfunction, mayhem and evil might we humans inspire-to if we no longer need to worry about personal safety, and can present ourselves as whatever sort of person we wish?  We see enough of this with the internet in today's world: how much farther will we go when we have fully functional bodies at our disposal instead of just computer screens?  A question you quickly ask of yourself while watching this film is ""Is this a future I want?"" The film tries to explore that question, but does so inconsistently.

There is fair amount of notable talent is in this film, including Bruce Willis in the lead role as ""Greer"" (a rehash of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;character he is best known for).  Willis has some really good chase scenes in the film, especially one early-on when we have a sort of ""Terminator"" in reverse, where Willis's surrogate doesn't stop pursuing a bad guy, despite being partially dismembered and badly banged up.  (That we have such a scene in this film isn't too surprising, given that the director of this film, Jonathan Mostow, also directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-3-Rise-of-the-Machines-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001TK80C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Widescreen Edition)</a>.)  Yet, despite the Director's prior work with SciFi action/suspense films, the result here is uneven, and gets less and less compelling, if even interesting, as the plot unfolds.

The film starts-out well, as it attempts to build on Willis's oft-seen persona as the ultimate tough guy detective.  We see leads being tenaciously uncovered and pursued, then slowly pieced together by Greer; but the too-rapid transition from a detective story to the cataclysmic end of civilization as we know it is not believable.  Also, the tension and suspense that we expect to build as such a film progresses simply is not there.

As for the supporting characters, I have not been a fan of Rosamund Pike's work in other films, such as the femme fatale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Another-Day-James-Bond-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQO3TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Another Day (James Bond) [Blu-ray</a>], but she does well here as Greer's wife, managing to plumb the emotional depths of her character despite the limited and flawed opportunities she was given to do so. I was impressed with her performance, and can say that I will now look forward to seeing her in future roles.

James Cromwell plays ""Canter"", the inventor of surrogate robot technology.  It is the same sort of reclusive, brilliant, eccentric scientist battling both his own inner demons and the world that we've enjoyed in his recurring role as ""Dr. Zefrem Cochrane"" in the Star Trek films and Dr. Alfred Lanning in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot-Blu-ray/dp/B0012GVKVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot [Blu-ray</a>].  His talent is wasted in this film, appearing in only a few clumsy scenes.  His character's final scene, where he is confronted by Greer, deserved much better writing, directing and editing than he got.

Ving Rhames (who is perhaps best known for his role as Marsellus Wallace in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B00006BSBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>), appears here in the much too limited role of ""The Prophet"": a dreadlocked and somewhat mysterious leader of those humans who oppose the ersatz world being built by VSI, the company that manufactures the surrogates.  Like the other supporting actors, if not the entire film, his role and his talent have great potential here, but potential that is entirely untapped.  None of the actors can be faulted for their work, they simply were not given much to work-with by the film's director, writers and editors.

The film is set entirely in and around Boston.  Like any resident of this area, I enjoyed seeing familiar landmarks throughout the film.  Yet, location does not a film make.

In summary, despite the high powered talent, the promise of the premise, and the intriguing philosophical questions that it raises, this movie quickly descends into mediocrity and stays there, with Willis (of course) saving the day in an ending that is entirely and unintentionally anticlimactic.  Too bad.  I expect we'll see it quickly disappear from the theatres, with a DVD/BluRay release coming soon after.

I'll give this film a two star rating: not worth spending the money to see in the theaters, nor worth buying the DVD when it first comes out; but probably something worth picking up on discount, a year or so from now.  I'm also sure that it, like other [better] Bruce Willis films, will be easy to find on late night movie channels in the not too distant future.",1253923200,,5690,5.725653206650831
3994165,3,B002UZCJ8Y,"First off, I'm happy to say that Surrogates was much better than I thought it would be. I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but I was bored today and the reviews haven't been too harsh. There is a lot more going on here than in most of the mindless drivel that comes out this time of the year. Sure there are some nifty action scenes, but this movie plays more like a drama with sci-fi elements and some thought provoking ideas on humanity. It's a little slow at times, but at around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Bruce Willis is solid here as usual. Nothing really special from him, but he's still the guy we know and love. The supporting cast features two beautiful women in Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike. Not only are they nice to look at, they make the most of the limited material they are given. I thought it was pretty funny how the filmmakers made all the actors so attractive as the robots and went out of their way to make them as ugly as possible in human form. Except for Bruce Willis curiously, who just looked flat out creepy as a Surrogate. Ving Rhames and James Cromwell add name recognition to the cast and perform rather well in their small roles.

The SFX are good at times and lacking at others, but nothing too bad or distracting. There is one neat twist I didn't see coming and the ending felt just right. Not too optimistic or depressing. I saw Gamer a few weeks ago and it shares a lot of similarities with this one, but Surrogates is a much stronger film with bigger ideas. I wouldn't rush out to see it, but this flick is worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed I, Robot or The Island.",1253836800,2,1637,4.328990228013029
