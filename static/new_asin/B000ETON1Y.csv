8114099,3,B000ETON1Y,"I am editing this review.  I should have given this 4 stars instead of 3 after viewing the video again.  It will not let me change the number of stars I gave it.

The audio is horrible on this video, but the motion offenses he shows are actually quite good and I plan on using at least one of them for my freshman level AAU team.

There are a lot of mediocre videos out there that give you little good info.  This video is actually pretty good and I do recommend it despite the crappy audio.",1196812800,,491,4.072916666666667
