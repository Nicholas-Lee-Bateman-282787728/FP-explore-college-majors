7100973,4,B00VPUF9BY,Definitely a different horror movie..not scary but really disturbing and eerie and creepy. Would recommend to watch if you're looking for a different horror movie,1441670400,,162,5.52
7100974,5,B00VPUF9BY,Awesome performance by Andrew Hopper!,1437177600,,37,6.6
7100975,5,B00VPUF9BY,A gem of a small budget horror film. You watch dozens of bad movies trying to find one like this.,1436486400,2,97,3.9
7100976,4,B00VPUF9BY,"Not too bad of a movie really expected a lot more gore from this but sadly no. The worst part of the movie I found was the extremely loud camera static they put in the movie, there was no point to this at all.",1435276800,,209,3.772727272727273
7100977,2,B00VPUF9BY,"not for the squeamish....really give me break. this was a joke, first off the nudity (or lack there of) was so sloppy. ok, so here we have two serial killers making a snuff film and they blurr out the genitalia parts while filming....seriously is that possible, and besides isn't that some of the stuff we're looking for within this kind of film, not to mention that you can blatantly see the actors are wearing flesh toned underwear in some shots...really poorly done guys c'mon get with it. ok with that said now lets move on to the violence (gore) parts if you will.....PG13 at best, a nail thru the hand and a cut across the belly of a chubby girl's belly....boring and not provoking any squeamish feelings at all. we got more gore from the Final Destination and Saw series than this ever did....Overall, very dissapointing.",1435190400,5,828,4.678082191780822
7100978,5,B00VPUF9BY,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I realized this film was directed by the same guys responsible for ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!, I wasn't sure what to think.  Should I expect campy comedy?  Or was this an attempt at serious horror?  Regardless of which direction these guys took, I figured I was in for fun.  And boy, was I right!  THE HOUSE WITH 100 EYES is a crazy, gory, cheeky horror/comedy hybrid, and it delivers on every level!  Its definitely not for those with weak stomachs, but it has a nice dose of dark humor as well.  Overall, this is one hell of an addition to my horror-comedy library!

I wasn't sure a movie about snuff films could actually be funny, but directors Jay Lee and Jim Roof succeed in making it so.  Granted, this is a solid horror flick in its own accord without the humor, so those who do not find it funny can take solace in that.  But if you watch for both aspects, youll be doubly pleased.

THE HOUSE WITH 100 EYES is shot well, even though it is from the perspective of the video cameras strewn throughout the house.  I am impressed with how well the production crew is able to blend them all together so well to create a fluid film.  And they don't hamper the film, either, like some found-footage does.  Theres no overly shaky camera shots or anything like that here.

The acting is great, with Jim Roof and Shannon Malone heading up the cast.  These two make THE PERFECT psychotic couple, and their performances bristle with both humor and drama.  I hope these two team up again in the future, as they play off of each other perfectly.

The special effects in THE HOUSE WITH 100 EYES are impressive, and theres plenty of gore to go around.  I particularly like a couple of the torture scenes from Eds dungeon.  I won't go into graphic detail, but theres plenty of carnage put to film, I assure you.

If I were forced to find a negative about THE HOUSE WITH 100 EYES, I simply couldnt.  The film is well made and a lot of fun.  As such, I give this a huge thumbs up.  I recommend every horror fan and gore-hound check this one out soon.  It will be available next week, so make a note!",1433894400,5,2157,4.33
7100979,5,B00VPUF9BY,"Saw this on the horror festival circuit last year, and it's one of the only horror movies EVER to make me genuinely cringe in disgust, yet what makes this awesome is that unlike the likes of Hostel and its endless dreary imitators, there's a lot more going on here, the script is great, there's some much-needed, but pitch-black, humour, and the lead couple are simultaneously hilarious, endearing, and absolutely terrifying, like The Brady Bunch meet The Manson Family, it's impossible to take your eyes off them, gotta highly recommend this as one of the most surprising, and excellent, horror movies of recent years",1433289600,7,618,5.009708737864078
7100980,4,B00VPUF9BY,It's a f*** up movie.,1449100800,,21,3.4

7100982,1,B00VPUF9BY,"Typical crap that the people in college today that are worried about their happy space and not the classes are pumping out for so called movies. The writing was unimaginative, and lacking any real direction, and the direction.....well the director needs to go back to school and/or watch a good movie of two hundred. There was no real cinematography with fixed cameras or other wise shaky sloppy hand held worse than any real amateur  would. The lousy lighting covered up other less effective scenes.",1448496000,2,500,4.9523809523809526
7100983,1,B00VPUF9BY,"Very nasty and scary movie, fast forwarded to check out, then quickly get the hell out of it! Still left with a stomach twist.",1448236800,,126,4.291666666666667
7100984,1,B00VPUF9BY,"Not my kind of entertainment, and certainly more perverse and weird than anything I have started to watch and clicked off after maybe 15 or 20 minutes!.",1448236800,,152,4.666666666666667
7100985,5,B00VPUF9BY,"A win win!! Some gore but mostly good twisted horror.  The ""100 eyes"" suggests something supernatural but there is none of that. Just good old murder and twisted plots with a nice twisted ending.",1448150400,,195,4.735294117647059

7100989,3,B00VPUF9BY,"its OK for a found footage movie trying to come off as a ""Snuff Film"" the comedic aspect provided some relief from the blurred body parts presented the argument what am I really as a film my problem was what kind of movie are I.ll leave it to you to figure out.",1447718400,,261,4.038461538461538
7100990,1,B00VPUF9BY,Boring,1447718400,,6,6.0
7100991,1,B00VPUF9BY,Terrible movie. Stopped watching when the dude started to play with himself.,1447286400,,76,5.416666666666667
7100992,1,B00VPUF9BY,"I don't get the comedy part, seriously.  wow, disgusting, showing just how low life can get.  Why film stuff like this?  I had to shut it off just right after his first temper tantrum.  wow.",1447286400,2,190,4.3428571428571425

7100995,1,B00VPUF9BY,it's bad,1447027200,,8,3.5
7100996,3,B00VPUF9BY,"This has some of the absolute worst audio. It's always either way too soft, or way too loud. I had to crank my volume very high to hear the actors soft voices, then there's unnecessary loud noise.  I have to give it 3 stars, because it really is an interesting movie. But if I have to constantly adjust my volume due to vast extremes of audio, it heavily subtracts from being able to enjoy it.

And just to be clear, the problem is not on my end. I just watched two movies before this, and didn't have to touch my volume at all.",1447027200,3,528,4.116504854368932
7100997,1,B00VPUF9BY,Couldn't sit through the first 15 mins or to even skip through.....,1446768000,,67,4.666666666666667
7100998,2,B00VPUF9BY,"The House With 100 Eyes is about a crazy couple who plan to make a snuff ""triple feature"" snuff film by picking up three people and killing them in their house outfitted with cameras in every room.  They also plan to do audio commentary and deleted scenes like a mainstream DVD.  But since the opening scrawl informs us that a third party received the footage in the mail and edited it after the police dismissed it as a hoax we already know things don't work out as planned.

It turns out these two aren't the most competent when it comes picking up victims or killing them, which might be the basis for a good horror comedy.  Unfortunately, The House with 100 Eyes suffers from neither this nor that syndrome.  It never really commits to being a horror comedy, despite some comedic elements.  It also isn't grisly enough to be the torture porn the set-up and poster suggests and there is no attempt that I could see to actually generate suspense, so what exactly is left?

The House with 100 Eyes has a few laughs, but not much else to recommend it.  The movie certainly isn't scary or suspenseful and while there is certainly some sadism it's probably too tame to please fans of grisly, violent horror.  In the end, The House of 100 Eyes is really not worth the time it takes to watch.",1442707200,6,1288,4.47008547008547
7100999,5,B00VPUF9BY,Amazing little found footage gem no one knows about. Great acting from 2 leads .  Not pointless like the Poughkeepsie tapes in that it's not just kidnap and kill and that's the end.  Got a lot of black humor thrown in with the strained relationship of two main psychos.  Also has good ending and little twists here and there.  See if want a scary murder story with a little revenge on the side.,1441670400,,394,4.3561643835616435
8710832,1,B00VPUF9BY,"This movie had some major issues,  When I want a horror/comedy combo, I would rather watch the original Evil Dead Trilogy or the Hatchet flix
 3 times in a row than sit through this garbage again.

The plot is stupid.  ""We're married and we want to make a 'masterpiece' sex/snuff film with three kills!  This will be our legacy, and help define our love!...""  I won't say more about the movie, except to say that I am sooo glad it isn't in my collection of nearly 5000 DVDs!  I would be so ashamed!

I'm glad I only wanted comedy from Prime.  Their horror films don't even deserve B movie standing.",1465516800,,598,4.363636363636363
8710833,1,B00VPUF9BY,"I am pissed that Amazon's Horror selection on Prime is all crap B movies. This movie's sound is like nails on a chalkboard most of the time. The sound gets soo loud that you have to stay glued to the remote to turn it down to damn near zero many times so you don't go deaf. Also the movie is a slasher unnecessary gore fedt of supreme lets be as disgusting as possible with terrible plot. They show a scene of one of the main characters masturbating whic mh is basically what the movie is, a big low brow jerk off fest.",1465257600,,519,4.098039215686274
