7974567,4,B00007AJFS,"This is my 7,5/10 mangaupdates review for the manga of which this is an direct adaptation. The anime is based on the first 40% of the source material btw: This manga is directly comparable to the first few South Park seasons before that show turned into biting satire and a masterpiece. The author also changed after he moved on but not for the better as this remains his best work with ""Wanitokagegisu"" (8/10). I also turn to America and Europe for (sex) comedy's but this one succeeds as it puts black/toiled humor first and titillation second. The humor will probably turn off the general audiences and the quirky art won't help but the first half (basically the amine) can be true comedy gold. Some of the rape jokes overreach, the story goes on too long and does not quite finish (hehe) but that part should get a translation too as it is still interesting. I don't get why the author decide to set this at a middle school or why the (surprisingly functioning ) romances aren't resolved but readable ecchi is rare so i will crown it the as maybe not as the king but certainly as the jester in the land of the blind. ""Genshiken"" (8/10) mentions the manga btw. and the also reviewed ""Love in Hell"" and ""The Penisman"" by ISHIDA Sui should be your next destination.",1426204800,,1266,4.532751091703057

7974569,5,B00007AJFS,"Lude, crude, and rude are the best adjectives to this immaturely funny comedy. Ping pong club is comedy not above fart, poop, and sex jokes. There is a lot that happens that will leave you saying ""WTF?"" with a big stupid grin on your face. It is hard to watch this with out feeling embarrassed that you are laughing at something so silly. You will get some laughs none the less. I would put this in one of the top funniest animes I have seen to date. it is only a few steps below GTO but doesn't seem to get nearly as much attention. If you aren't above a fart joke then give this series a gander. It will be worth it.",1363046400,,618,4.073770491803279
7974570,5,B00007AJFS,"I took a chance with this anime when I saw it. I mean the front cover looks rather intimidating and bizzar..as is the rest of this anime. Now I am not much for anime for the simple fact that most anime is the same old same old highschool drama, guy loves girl bla bla bla and so forth.
Like everyone else says this is not an ideal show for children, I mean, there is nudity and language as there is suggestive nature and all that goody goody stuff we all get to enjoy with age. The story itself just revolves around a ping pong club and these highschool students each with their charming or vulgar personalities and wits. It is truly a comedy that can not remain serious for about five minutes and if you are the type who just wants loads of laugh and love random humour this series will throw you for a loop. With how long it is none can resist its charms of time consuming animations and its loads of laughs to come. I suggest this movie to those of you who like bobobo or excel saga!",1214784000,,986,4.167539267015707
7974571,5,B00007AJFS,"ok, i know everyone is saying that this is the japanese take on south park but i don't really see it. it goes way beyond south park and makes south park look tame. also, this show aired on japanese television from 4/5/1995 to 9/27/1995 and south park premiered on 8/13/1997. this series is about 5 group of ping pong players and their manager, if you can call kyoko that, and the things they get into to satisfy their sexual perversions and such and along the way play some ping pong. it's kind of like borat to me, in that it's just wrong. i really can't discribe this series other than it's kind of like junk food. you like it even knowing it's not really good for you. it's funny if you like sick and nasty humor. if you don't, than you'll probably not like this series. i laughed hard on some episodes and not so much on others. overall, i like the series. 9 out of 10. oh, it's not for kids.",1179878400,,896,4.215116279069767
7974572,4,B00007AJFS,"At first I thought this was going to be a corny Japanese rip-off of South Park but it isnt. It's something more freaky and funky all-together. The

characters all seem innocent yet they are some of the most twisted things to come in the form of cartoons in ages. Not for the squemish.",1168992000,,284,4.3584905660377355
7974573,4,B00007AJFS,This series is by far amazing!  CAUTION NOT FOR CHILDREN AND THE FAINT OF HEART.  I laughed my pants off.  This series is histerical.  I recommend it to everybody.  I was sick and pop the DVDs and felt better by just laughing at the DVDs.  The song at the ending credits was very touching too.  I want to know if the creator/producers made more.  I watched the whole seriers in three days.,1068249600,5,389,4.305555555555555
7974574,4,B00007AJFS,"I have watched the first two volumes of the Ping Pong Club and I have to say that it surprised me. It is not for children. I repeat this is not for children! It has alot of sexual puns and jokes in it. It is not hentai(for those anime fans that know what I'm talking about) or anything but it does contain lewd moments of nudity and sexually explicit scenes. Of course, it's done in a way that makes it bearable and very funny. I really like this anime so far. I plan to watch the entire thing.
The basic story of this anime is about a group of guys that are all on the ping pong team. They are very competitive and surprisingly good and bad at the same time if you can believe it. The cast of characters spend much of their time practicing for ping pong competitions and drooling like pigs over girls. At least two of the charaters Miaino and Cappuccino (yes, that is his name) are the really lewd ones that keep the running sex jokes going. The rest of the guys are pretty tame. Sometimes Tonoka, the littlest guy in the bunch with a big round head, can get a little risque at times but nothing as crazy as the other two. The ping pong club so far seems to be mostly about a group of friends who are enjoying life maybe too much.
Check out the Ping Pong Club if you're interested in some lewd, crude, and just so funny fun!",1047081600,12,1325,4.1395348837209305
