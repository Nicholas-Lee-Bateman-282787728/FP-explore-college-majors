8593071,2,B00DH0WQ66,Let's address this right off the bat: this is a clipshow. Most of the movie is made up from stock footage and the new scenes are mainly just bad acting and not so well written lines. The clips though are usually the best scenes from the past so pre dvd/internet era this would have been nice to have. The series films are retold by characters in the present who try to make one coherent timeline through the films. There are still some holes but its nice to see how they filled in some time gaps. They do skip over some spots of the previous movies though. Its not a good movie by any standards but its more interesting than some of the other films in the series.,1470528000,,663,4.228346456692913
