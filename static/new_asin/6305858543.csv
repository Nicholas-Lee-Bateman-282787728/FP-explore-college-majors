7896438,4,6305858543,"Upon entering this disc into the DVD player, I immediately fainted from the anger of having spent any money on this whatsoever. After waking up and finding the film still going, I did my best to eject it before it could have any more effects on me. Sadly I was frozen in terror after witnessing how little the people making this cared. Even better, this took five whole years to make! So, with all this negative, why is the review so high? Because this is a good bad movie.

The main protagonist, Paige, learns over the course of the movie that what's outside is all that really matters, helps start the murdering (and raping) legacy of Black-Bluebeard, teaches Cleopatra to use her beauty to have hundreds of thousands of murdered in a war, and that nobody really needs fluid animation. Through this journey, she has the help of Aladdin, who seems to not really care about her as he is hoping to marry and hump Cleopatra, until he finds out she's fat. Oh no! Drama!

This movie is so odd that it would be criminal if you've never seen it. By the end of this film I knew that Paige was the epitome of evil and we should all hail her before she causes something much worse to happen.",1380499200,3,1182,4.392694063926941

But if you make the mistake of thinking that, the people at New Horizons will not mind!  Here is the basic story: ALADDIN makes a new friend named PAIGE, who lives in the modern world!  He takes her on his MAGIC CARPET for a RIDE THROUGH TIME!  They get to meet Egyptian Queens, English Kings, Pirates and even Dinosaurs!  Ed Gilbert and Jennifer Darling do the voices, so that might give you a good idea of what to expect!  Think of this as ""Aladdin and Paige's Excellent Adventure""!  This is a film that manages to be neither all that educational or all that entertaining!",1002931200,12,673,4.512396694214876
