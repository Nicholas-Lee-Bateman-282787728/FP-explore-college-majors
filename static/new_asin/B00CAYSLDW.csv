5710589,4,B00CAYSLDW,"Lots of fun to watch, but it's a year old.  I would watch Nathan Fillion sit in a chair, he doesn't have to do anything!!!",1369785600,,122,3.88
5710590,5,B00CAYSLDW,This video is great!! It really shows the personalities of each star of Castle and they are so funny!! The really seem to get along and how a great relationship. I buy everything Nathan Fillion is in and this is another great video for my collection.,1369785600,,250,4.456521739130435
5710591,3,B00CAYSLDW,"Diehard fans will love this DVD.  Even those of us who are past the screaming stage when they see their favorite celeb can find enjoyment from the banter and obvious bonding between the cast members.  I wish they had been able to be more candid instead of the contrived sketch and dialogue led by the m.c.  It looks like the script writers are going to have to give ""Kevin"" more to do if the reaction of the crowd to him is any indication, and the one bit of information I found most interesting was the fact his real wife played his wife on the show - trivia that keeps things interesting.",1369612800,8,590,4.297297297297297
5710592,5,B00CAYSLDW,A must for any Castle fan. This DVD offers fans a chance to see the cast in a relaxed and playful unscripted fashion. Paleyfest really knows how to get the cast of any show together in a room and allow fans to ask questions we would all like to get answers to and the Castle crew really know how to answer those questions in an entertaining way. I'm so glad that I bought this DVD!,1369094400,,381,4.093333333333334
5710593,5,B00CAYSLDW,"The only thing I didn't like about this dvd, was it ended very abruptly.

5710596,3,B00CAYSLDW,This was just a Q&A for the cast members and not an actual episode. If I had paid better attention to the description I wouldn't have bothered with it.,1368403200,,151,4.241379310344827

5710605,5,B00CAYSLDW,"Awesome show!!!  Each episode is unique and it has the perfect dose of humor mixed in.  They solve crimes in every episode, yet I don't feel like I'm watching the same thing over and over again.  The writers are doing an awesome job and the cast is great.",1458432000,,255,4.270833333333333

5710621,5,B00CAYSLDW,"Although my cable watch time is very limited, mostly to PBS English mysteries and Masterpiece presentations, the TV program ""Castle"" is one of my very favorites. It has great characters and good writing.  I really like and story lines that I can relate to. I enjoyed the interview session that gave all of the actors who play the main characters a chance to talk and to show who they are. The actors are charming. They seem to be the kind of real people I would be able to relate to. I am looking forward to the time when this series will be part of the Prime Video lineup.",1444176000,,573,4.305555555555555

5710628,4,B00CAYSLDW,thought it was good - the interviewer was not that interesting to me - if you are a hard core lover of the show you will like it as it shows everyone as they look in their normal clothes- you can tell they are a close knit group of people and they were joking around with each other -,1442016000,,284,3.830508474576271

5710634,3,B00CAYSLDW,It was OK. I love Castle but the interview seemed boring. Feel free to check it out yourself. Stana Katic hardly said anything. Maybe have it on while you are doing something else and pay attention when you hear something interesting.,1439683200,,234,4.7317073170731705

5710646,4,B00CAYSLDW,"Paleyfest events are always cool. I would have given 5 stars but it was hard to watch Stana Katic. Everyone else was loose and engaging,but she would only speak when directly asked to comment on something. Then she would go into a giggling fit like she was embarrassed that she actually said something without a script... Cute,yes. But she seemed way out of her league sitting next to Susan Sullivan, Tamala Jones et al...",1433894400,,422,4.716216216216216

5710652,5,B00CAYSLDW,This was most interesting to me. I came in late in watching this series so I did not know so much about the actors.

5710712,5,B00CAYSLDW,"Given the previous 2010 Paley Centre Castle dvd, this one does appear more professional and the sound is slightly better (but it's still no more that a camera at the back of the audience).  It's more structured than the previous dvd and appears to be a bigger setting which I thought meant it lost a little of the homely feel of the original.  Don't expect any more than it is - it's a chat with the cast where some members of the audience got to ask questions.  Don't expect any add ons or extras.  I'm doubtful about whether it's worth the money or not, but hey if you're a fan you'll want to see it no matter what any review says (am I right?).",1399852800,,647,4.193548387096774

It was weird to see the actors in a non-Castle environment: Stana was so extremely shy and nervous that it was pretty hard to watch (covering her face with her hands, looking at the floor a lot, folding over into her lap)... I never would have guessed that about her because Beckett is so confident.  Part of the problem is that with *that* many people on stage, you only get a few minutes with each.  And everyone else sits around bored until it is their turn.",1393200000,,556,4.368932038834951

5710732,5,B00CAYSLDW,I'd seen clips from this but still enjoyed the entire program.  It was interesting to see the cast out of character.  Stana laughs a lot!

The cast is as personable as you would want them to be.  I think most of the questions are relatively insightful.  The reading from ""The Blue Butterfly"" is great, Seamus's accent is hilarious (we don't get to see him do it often but I love his Irish brogue. Nathan Fillion is as amazing as always (and as always I could use more of him).  Much of what they allude to as going to happen has happened but it's nice to see that most of the characters were looking forward to the changes.  I do wonder what Molly thinks of the changes now as she was more resistant than the rest of the cast.

I love the little tidbits of insight into some of my favorite characters on TV...I mean who knew that Beckett's favorite color was purple or that she loves strawberry milkshakes?  Now I do!",1383004800,,903,4.3017751479289945

5710771,3,B00CAYSLDW,"If you like Castle, this may appeal to you: the entire cast of regulars sits and has some fun for about an hour.  BUT the moderator is self-absorbed (Will Keck, TV Guide Magazine), and he takes forever to get into anything important. There are imbalances: he cannot get Stana Katic to talk, he tends to focus on the actors sitting closest to him (Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn), but Andrew Marlowe is sitting 9 chairs away.  Marlowe has some interesting things to say about the complexity and story archs of the series (and future directions), but he's not allowed to reveal much. There's some cute joking around between Seamus Dever, Jon Huertas, & Tamala Jones at one point, but Penny Johnson Jerald, while lively, gets a little too much airtime (Susan Sullivan, usually fun, seems uncomfortable throughout). Nathan Fillion is very charming -- and he sets up some clowning with Huertas and Dever. He also answers for Katic several times, which adds to an unevenness of air-time by the major players. Overpriced for what is delivered.",1373760000,18,1033,4.897142857142857

Nice to know the Creator had that in mind.  Blown away by the writing-- and the actors-- who breathe life into it so well.

Yes, even though I found nothing on the DVD or the case, it is a DVD-R per the Blu-ray player.

It played perfectly and very clear.  It lasted 1 hr. 7 min. 53 sec. After 14 min they did a ""3 min"" reading of parts of The Blue Butterfly but took over 7 minutes and was hard to understand since they were doing different accents. At 49 min. they took questions from the audience.  I think they could have done a better job with the reading but it was fun, anyway. The cast from Castle really is great.  I  love the show and was happy to get this newest Paleyfest of the actors and the creator/executive producer. Wlll Keck did a great job as well.",1371513600,13,1017,4.388297872340425

I love the writing and directing...I just love the whole show and love to see the cast answering questions as themselves, talking about the parts they play and how they approach each story line. CASTLE WELL DONE",1370563200,4,326,4.360655737704918
5710783,5,B00CAYSLDW,I stumbled across Castle a few months ago on Hulu Plus and it is so well scripted and acted that it has become a guilty pleasure of mine and getting to see behind the scenes dynamics between the actors was a treat and clearly shows the basis for the shows unexpected success,1370563200,4,274,4.288461538461538
5710784,5,B00CAYSLDW,All of the actors and actresses did an excellant job. They were just like they are on the show. It seems that they were very comfortable and expressed themselves wonderfully. I really enjoyed it.,1370563200,3,195,4.764705882352941
5710785,4,B00CAYSLDW,"I give the Paleyfest 4 stars because I like the Castle show.  I have watched all but a few of the episodes.  Mystery, funny guy, good relationships with co-workers, laughter.  Some of the audience statements/questions were different, but these fans are the 'borderline fanatic types'.  The actors were being themselves mostly, so it is good to see another side to them.  'Kate' was more like a nervous teenager, with few words and over dramatized behavior.  The background from the writers helps see reasons for some changes in the episodes.  Writers control more than I realized.
Since I have read very little background info on the actors, the tidbits from their real lives were a real positive to me.  Making the actors accessible to fans was an overall positive to the enjoyment of the Castle story for me.

I would recommend the Castle: Cast & Creators Live at PALEYFEST for fans of the Castle show, mystery readers, Fire Fly buffs, and folks who like to see actors talking about their work.",1370390400,30,996,4.811764705882353
5710786,5,B00CAYSLDW,"I am a Castle fanatic. I can watch the episodes repeatedly and not get tired. Watching this made me love it more. I can feel the closeness of the characters in the show but more importantly through this, I can say that their relationship is the same in real life. They are so funny and I believe they love what they do that is why they can connect to their viewers effectively.

Kudos to the writers for all their hard work and creativity to bring new and exciting stories week after week.",1370217600,19,489,4.315217391304348

8579491,5,B00CAYSLDW,"Thoroughly enjoyed the event; always nice to see this cast without the protective armor they enjoy on the set. The best part was witnessing both the humor and humility of Stana Katic. I truly miss this show and pray that someone will soon ""WAKE UP"" and bring CASTLE back for a 9th season !!",1473811200,,290,4.388888888888889

8579499,4,B00CAYSLDW,"Great cast interview. I loved Nathan Fillion's sense of humor, he made this such a joy to watch.  I was sadly surprised at how immature Stana Katic is, she rarely gave answers that made any sense and then laughed as if she was very funny, I found her very odd and sophomoric. Katic is a world traveler and fluent in several languages but she made it seem as though the series Castle was just a joke to her. It would have been nice if they all spoke up more but Nathan picked up the slack when others just sat there. Nathan carried this very well and made it a lot of fun to watch, great personality.",1463961600,,599,4.163793103448276
