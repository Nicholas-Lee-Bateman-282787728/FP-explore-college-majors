4018665,3,B002ZG9904,"I have always enjoyed watching the Shrek movies with my family.  The fourth movie was no exception.  The problem is that the Shrek universe it getting rather stale.  The same type of jokes just don't work as well the fourth time around.  The Final Chapter finds Shrek unhappy with his friends and family and wishing to go back to being a scary ogre for just one day which can be supplied by an evil Rupelstiltskin.  But if you are aware of the myth of Rupelstiltskin you know that every contract has a price.  Shrek gives up one day of his life to get his one day of freedom.  That one day though causes the entire world to change and Shrek is stuck in an alternate universe in which he never existed.  The alternate characters are fun at first, especially the chubby Puss in Boots, but they all revert quickly to the characters you know so it doesn't work all that well.  The best part of the movie is the introduction of the Rupelstiltskin character who is a fun bad guy.  The movie's plot however is very similar to the Christmas Special in which Shrek doesn't appreciate what he has until it is gone.  I like the series, but the story is best to end now.",1274832000,25,1158,4.339534883720931
4018666,4,B002ZG9904,"I saw this with a friend earlier, and it was a lot better than we expected. Shrek isn't feeling too happy with his life with everyone, and wants everything quiet, the way it used to be. Shrek meets up with Rumpelstiltskin, who makes him a deal; if Shrek gives him a day from his past, Rumpel will give Shrek a day where he will be feared again. Unfortunately, Rumpel takes the day that Shrek was born. Fiona, Donkey, Puss in Boots and the rest of the gang don't even know him. Shrek only has 24 hours to figure out how to return his life to normal, and get Fiona to fall in love with him again. It all comes down to this in the final chapter. I highly recommend SHREK FOREVER AFTER!!!",1274745600,,684,4.1893939393939394
4018667,3,B002ZG9904,"SHREK FOREVER AFTER feels like a really good episode of a much loved TV show.  For me, the first SHREK movie was something really new, a pop-culture referring, smart-alecky spin on fairy tales, with delightfully new characters and an animation style we hadn't seen before.  It was genuinely touching at times, but mostly hilarious and eye-popping.  SHREK 2 turned up the hilarity quotient and introduced Puss, one of the finest supporting characters in animation since Sebastian the Crab grace THE LITTLE MERMAID.  With SHREK 3, the series had settled into comfortable familiarity.  I smiled more than I laughed...it was clever, but had no thrill of being NEW anymore.  And in this latest film, it felt extremely familiar...like a TV series.

First , it's important to note that an enjoyment of SHREK FOREVER AFTER (hereafter called SHREK 4) pretty much requires having seen the other 3 movies.  There is essentially no exposition.  We see Shrek and his family a few days before the First Birthday party for his three children.  While Shrek is enjoying a life of domestic bliss, he's also feeling a little trapped.  He can't even enjoy a good dip in some hot mud without having to first work on the plumbing in the outhouse.  His kids wake him up too early every morning.  His friend Donkey is constantly dropping by with HIS kids and consuming Shrek's evenings.  And when the day of the party arrives, Shrek realizes that he misses being a bachelor and a feared Ogre.  Now little kids ASK him to do his Ogre-roar and sign autographs...instead of running in fear.  I guess Shrek is having a mid-life crisis.

But this being a magical kingdom, when Shrek idly wishes he could have ""just one day"" back during his wilder days...the nasty, spiteful little Rumplestiltskin grants him his wish in a fairly one-side bargain.  Shrek is instantly transported to his past, but finds that things have changed.  Rumple now rules the kingdom, and is served by witches.  The ogres are a hunted species and humans are destitute and living in fear.  And none of Shrek's old friends recognize him.  His beloved Fiona is now a resistance leader among the ogres, and she has little interest in Shrek.  But it turns out, he must win her love again within a day, or this retelling of the past will become permanent, and Shrek will puff out of existence.

This is all well and good, and certainly the movie has sufficient laughs.  The pop culture references HAVE been toned down some, which is probably good.  They were leaning towards becoming too much of a good thing in SHREK 3, when a lengthy sequence was devoted to making fun of HARRY POTTER...the in-jokes were becoming the point rather than a side note.  The changes in Donkey and particularly Puss in Boots are fun.  The animation is as good as ever...but there's nothing new either.  It's just a visit with some old, familiar friends having some serious trouble.

The voice-over work (Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, etc. etc.) is perfectly fine.  The soundtrack is perfectly in keeping with what we've had from these films before.  (I will say, however, that I suspect this film may be less appealing to the little ones than the others.  My youngest is 17, so I don't have a certainty about this...I just think that this film is more plot-driven than those in the past, and the time-travel stuff might confuse the littlest viewers.)

And the movie is in 3D, but never has 3D seemed more pointless.  We're just becoming SO accustomed to the 3D experience now, and there were NO moments of ""oooooh"" popping out of the screen at the audience.  Frankly, I mostly forgot the film WAS in 3D until it was time to take the glasses off and drop them in the recycle bin on the way out.

If you've seen the first film, do you remember how joyful the final scene was, when all the characters gathered and sang and partied to a variety of pop/rock hits?  I remember wanting the scene to just keep going on, because I had experienced such a joyful and NEW movie, and didn't want it to end.  SHREK 4 has a similar scene (as did all the other films), and when this one started, I was pretty much ready to head for the exits.  There isn't anything actively wrong with the film...but there's nothing staggeringly RIGHT about it either.",1274659200,11,4282,4.695302013422819
4018668,5,B002ZG9904,"Our family just watched Shrek Forever and we loved it. We laughed our heads off and as usual with Shrek movies we have so many favorite scenes that we can't even remember them all. Pussnboots and Donkey just crack me up. Amazing in 3-d!

4018669,4,B002ZG9904,"""Shrek Forever After"" (if that is its real title) achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve simply by being a fun animated comedy with characters we've come to love. Still, for something so heavily promoted as being the final chapter, I'm surprised at how small and ordinary it seemed. Movies like this should end with a bang, emotionally and physically; they should not go from beginning to end on a slow and steady burn. By the end, most will feel as if they've been entertained. I felt that way. At the same time, some may feel that, in all likelihood, this movie didn't have to be made. I felt that way, too. Perhaps it's no longer a good sign that we can be so easily amused by unnecessary films. Are they no stories left to stimulate our imaginations and broaden our horizons at the same time?

In this film, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) finds that he's dissatisfied with his new life as a domestic ogre. As a husband and father, he has absolutely no free time. Villagers no longer fear him. He can't take a mud bath without being invaded by swamp tourists. Knowing he's desperate for a change, the disgruntled Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn) offers Shrek a chance live one day as his old ogre self. The catch, as I understand it, is that one day out of his past will be erased from time - give a day to get a day, according to Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek agrees and signs a contract, although he fails to specify precisely which day he'll let Rumpelstiltskin have. Bad move; he's transported to an alternate Far Far Away that's ruled by Rumpelstiltskin and has fallen into ruin.

There are other changes. At Rumpelstiltskin's bidding, ogres are hunted by wicked witches and forced into slavery. Shrek's best friend, Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), now a lowly cart puller, has never met Shrek and is afraid of him. Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) is now an obese housecat and owned by Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), no longer Shrek's beloved wife and mother to his children but rather the iron-clad leader of an underground ogre resistance. Like Donkey, she has no idea who Shrek is. Stranger still, she's back under the curse that factored into the first film. In this new Far Far Away, it's as if Shrek had never been born. If he's to set everything right, he must turn to that most reliable of fairy-tale clichs: Receiving true love's kiss before the following sunrise.

What are Rumpelstiltskin's motives? I leave it to you to find out. I will say that his reasons are about as good as they can be for a fairy tale. I liked this character; big of ego and short of stature, he's villainous in a childish, sniveling sort of way, making for a great deal of fun when he loses his temper.

Many of the previous film's more memorable side characters are used far less frequently in ""Shrek Forever After,"" making for a film that feels oddly condensed. The appearances of Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, and Gingy the Gingerbread Man, for example, are reduced to mere cameos, which is a missed opportunity for some great comedy. I'm especially fond of Gingy, with his iced legs and candy eyes and grating voice. In the alternate Far Far Away, he has become a battle-scarred gladiator who fights for the amusement of cheering crowds; the fact that his opponents are animal crackers and that he uses a broken lollipop as a weapon is, in my warped way of thinking, inherently funny. Maybe it's because foods of such childish innocence have become violent. Or maybe it has something to do Gingy being one tough cookie.

It seems that the film's biggest draw, aside from being the last in the series, is its release in 3-D. I've championed certain 3-D films (Disney's ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""Avatar""), but now that it's back in the mainstream, I'm coming to the realization that, generally speaking, it's an overrated marketing gimmick. For this particular film, I suggest you save your cash for a traditional (and less expensive) 2-D experience. I'm quite certain the overall quality will not be affected.

The bottom line: The story is funny and exciting and sweet, and I had a pleasant time watching it. But ""Shrek Forever After"" is not the grandiose finale the ads have claimed it to be, and I find that a little disappointing. My recommendation relates not to its worth as a successor to the previous ""Shrek"" films, or even to its status as the last in the series; it relates to the belief that audiences will enjoy it on its own terms. It's a light, good-hearted animated comedy, and as such films go, it gets the job done. I can only hope the filmmakers don't treat it like a horror franchise, some of which are known to produce sequels even after a ""final chapter"" has been released. At that point, I don't think there will anything good left to say about Shrek and his magical misadventures.",1274400000,34,4842,4.6441073512252045

4018692,2,B002ZG9904,"I'm a big fan of Shrek and the genius of Mike Meyers, but this movie is disappointing at best. As the forth installment, I can't say how well this would fare standing by itself but it's definitely the lowest point of the series. The first was gold obviously, because it earned three sequels, and showcased the comedic genius and insanity of Mike Meyers with some great creativity. The next two were solid sequels lacking something in comedy and greatness but good nonetheless.

In this movie, Mike Meyers seems constrained - or uninterested - and it lacks his signature charm. In exchange for his hilarious wit and sarcastic and clever jabs, we get half an attempt at tackling some more grown up problems that these characters might realistically have. The other half seems a hollow push to involve some of the underused characters a bit more, especially the women. The problem is, it's not as good and it's see-through. It feels forced, uncreative.

While this one might be decent if it were episode one, it's hard to say, it fails to live up to the series and particularly the characters that drive it. Let's face it, the story is rather slim in all of them in the sense that the biggest part of the plot is that it twists the plot from what we know of fairy tail tropes. This works very well for Shrek with careful editing and just enough story, less so after that and in the forth the idea seems to be to twist the formula from what we know of Shrek and turn it on it's head.  All the characters become someone else and the relationships and indeed the fairy tail world get rewritten for the sake of a story of maturing into adulthood. Confusing? Yeah, it doesn't work out so well however, it's still Shrek and anyone who loves the movies will still want to see this at least once.

I'm not a fan of undoing all that has been done to create robust characters as a plot device for a sequel so after having seen it, I have no inclination to watch it again. It honestly didn't make me laugh, and without that what was left? Not enough of the golden goodness from the original, that's for sure.",1510531200,,2094,4.45953002610966

4019069,5,B002ZG9904,"This film was excellent and it was wonderful to see it in cinemas. It helped me more than anything to understand the nature of Sportacus, He Who Must Not Be Made a DeaL With, so that I would never, ever make any deal with him because Rumpelstiltskin looks exactly like him. Of course we know that Rumpelstilstkin is not a real character however, but there will always be people like that - usupers. The film's intention was to provide the fan of Shrek with a successful installment which would conclude from the first three, and manages to do that very well. Interestingly Rumpelstiltskin presents himself as a sort of a banker like travelling salesman who is willing to sign any deal people make with him but can never confirm any deal, because he trusts no one, least of all himself. While I know the film is not set in the world of Lazy Town, and has nothing to do with that I could not help noticing the remarkable, unintended similarities between the way the fictional Rumpelstiltskin behaves in the movie, and Sportacus does in Lazy Town, because like him, Rumpelstiltskin is very funnily shown as an elf who turns into a hurricane before he ruins everything around him and finally becomes doomed to be the vehicle of his own self destruction. Shrek is the opposite of that - builds himself up and makes everything grow he touches and attracts people who quest after doing the same while all Rumpelstiltskin can do is eliminating anybody who is NOT an opposition (he just thinks they are because he is Rumpelstiltskin). I went to see this film with a few family members and like I said, we were overwhelmingly entertained. I could not believe I was watching a fourth installment in the same series because I had not read anything about it in newspapers or watched the trailer, online or anywhere else for that matter. Not surprisingly the producers are seriously considering another sequel. Shrek will always be better than Lazy Town in my opinion, because Shrek movies are simply produced by more talented guys than the ones who do Lazy Town episodes. To sum it all up - it has very similar action as the previous films and if you have patience for this kind of a storyline it will take you directly to its center. However, please do not take this five star reviews as an advise to go see the film. This review is based on a personal fun I had with the movie, and should not be taken as a filmgoing advise. Top notch quality of a 3 - D film which is something that is very hard to do with such anime nowadays.",1473984000,,2516,4.531868131868132

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus:]
Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.

[Chorus 2x]

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

4019657,3,B002ZG9904,"Once upon a time, there was an animated franchise that was a biting take on the familiar form of the fairy tale.  While it had many of the required elements, it skewered them, making itself fun for all.  Shrek Forever After is the fourth film in the franchise, and it has really lost its bite.

I can't help but find that ironic since as this movie opens Shrek (Mike Myers) is feeling a shadow of his former self.  His days are filled with taking care of his three babies.  His house in the swamp is now a stop on the Star Tours bus tour.  And with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) stopping by every night and Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) never ending to do list, it seems he never has a moment for himself.

At a birthday party for the triplets, Shrek finally loses it and storms out.  Unfortunately, his tantrum is seen by Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn).  Rumpelstiltskin has been plotting for years to take over the kingdom, and he sees this as his opportunity.  He offers Shrek a day of being a carefree, feared ogre.  But that day of fun becomes more than Shrek bargained for.  Will he lose everything, or can he find a loophole in his contract?

What made the first Shrek so much fun was its irreverent take on the familiar fairytale genre.  That is completely gone here.  While I enjoyed the second and third movie, they didn't have quite the same satirical edge either.  But this one almost seems to have forgotten it was a comedy.  Yes, there were some parts that were funny, but there were long stretches that were entertaining but not all that funny.

The story isn't really that original at this point, either.  Yes, once or twice I wondered how the characters would get out of that particular predicament, but the story was pretty much predictable.

Now all this makes the movie sound bad, and it isn't.  I actually did enjoy watching it, probably because I like the characters.  It was fun to see them in a new setting reconnecting with each other.

And the voice cast continues to do great work.  Other than the returning lead characters (and other well known returning cast members like Julie Andrews), the cast is mostly unknowns.  Famous or not, they brought their characters to life admirably.

And the animation looks great.  While still obviously a cartoon, it has really grown since the first Shrek movie almost 10 years ago.  I saw the movie in 3D because that's the only way it's still showing in theaters around here.  While I don't think the added visuals are worth the $4 extra they charge in my town, I did find them a fun addition to the story.

Shrek Forever After is still a decent movie, but the ogre has long left the franchise.  Hopefully, they truly let it fade into memory after this entry and let the characters enjoy their happily ever after.",1430870400,,2789,4.551307847082495

4020047,3,B002ZG9904,"I had the chance to see Shrek Forever After (fourth installment in the Shrek series) at the Tribeca
Film Festival where it had its premiere more than a month agobut I didn't take it. I read the synopsis
and thought, Forget it. The first Shrek was excellentalbeit especially for the kids. The soundtrack
from the first film still ranks among my absolute favorites (you might even say its one of those films
where I actually liked the soundtrack more). The second Shrek was so bad in my estimation that I barely
even considered seeing the third. So when the fourth came out, I was already not compelled to see it.
When I heard the premise is lifted from Its a Wonderful Life, I was almost repelled.
Okay, but Ive been hearing some good reports about the film, especially in essentially kicking the
daylights out of Sex and the City 2 at the box office, and I thought, Maybe its not that bad. And
frankly, it wasn't all that bad. Im putting my reputation on the line here, so let me be clear. If youve
never seen a Shrek film, of course you're not going to see this one as well. If you liked only the first
Shrek film, you will be disappointed with this one but you won't hate it like the past immediate two
blunders. If you loved those two blunders, this is your cue to stop reading this column (at least when Im
writing).
Yeah, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is still not as funny as he was in the first movie, and the supporting
characters are sort of a blur here as well. The storyline is liftedno doubt, but its done so with some
originality. Shrek (Mike Myers), burdened by his new family and extenuating obligations from princes
turnedogre Fiona (Cameron Diaz), wishes for a simpler life when he was a real ogre, the one that
villagers would hunt down with pitchforks. He gets his wish by dealing with the conniving
Rumplestiltskin (Walter Dohrnof SpongeBob SquarePants fame).
And its not like this storyline hasn't been attempted in recent history as well. Consider Santa Clause 3,
where Santa (Tim Allen) wishes for the same and there the conniving Jack Frost (Martin Short) takes
over the North Pole in a surreal alternative world. But that movie failed miserably. Shrek Forever After
manages to pull something together with this overused storyline. Not sure I would spend extra to see it
in IMAX (still cant believe its playing in IMax), but certainly has enough color and action to see on the
big screen.
Okay. Theres a halfdecent review for supposedly the last in a series that really shouldnt have been.

4020128,3,B002ZG9904,"The 4th Shrek. The idea has worn thin. So they rebooted to see what would have happened if Shrek had never been born. They have Rumpelstilskin reimaged from the 2nd Shrek (completely different looking) and he has a life as con artist specializing in convoluted contracts with magic. Shrek doesn't like the constant rowdiness of his kids, of parties, of tourists, of taking care of kids. He wants to be alone. Don't we all! So, he wishes to feared again--exchange a day for another day -- namely the day he was born for a day he can scare people. But Fiona waits in vain for Prince Charming. Her parents sign themselves out of existence with a contract with Rumpelstilskin and years more pass. Fiona breaks out of the castle herslf and joins a band of rogue ogres, where she learns some very impressive fighting skills (perhaps copying Xena: Warrior Princess here?), For awhile Shrek enjoys himself, but somehow manages to get captured by witches who work for Rumpelstilskin, who is now emperor.
  Meanwhile, Fiona is still cursed. Human by day, ogre by night (an idea used in Gargoyles TV series for the character Demona) -- and somehow she manages to hide that fact from the other ogres. It strikes me as an old tired werewolf motif. Fiona is bitter at her lost childhood, and is obsessed with revolution and fighting (again sounds like Demona). Shrek realizes he made a mistake and wants to undo the spell put on him. He must kiss Fiona, but she doesn't love him. She has to love him back in order for it to work. True love's kiss--one of the oldest and most tiresome cliches out of fairy tales. So, first he has to woo her all over again and make her fall in love with him. Ah, conditions, conditions!
  So, with more twists to the plot than necessary, with false starts, and at first the kiss doesn't work. He finally, after allowing himself to be captured in order to free the other ogres, he discovers (1) Fiona is only part ogre, so was not released (2)by showing his fighting skills he impresses Fiona and soon she does fall for him. (Kill the enemy to impress the girl, how barbaric). First, he has to release her, and his friends crash right back into the castle. Big fight, but he runs out of time -- and at the last second Fiona lovingly kisses him as he is fading away--then she realizes she is still an ogre when the sun comes up. AAAugh!!!. Then that alternative reality dissolves and all are no more.
  Then Shrek is back at the birthday and he realizes he has to enjoy this constant togetherness. Aauggghhh!! or he will lose Fiona and his kids and his friends. Yet he deserves some time for himself when all are asleep. A conservative pro-family theme.
  While a good film, it is not a great film. I understand the writers tried to do something new with the fairy tale plot, but it still has a lack of originality. The Devil's Contact is a tired worn out motif. The what would happen if someone was never born has been done too many times. The someone is one thing in day time, a monster (of some kind) at night is as old as fairy tales. I remember a very similar plot in Norwegian Folk Tales, by Asbjornsen and Moe, which I read more than 40 years ago.
  What I liked was Fiona as a warrior princess--ripping off Xena. She wore her hair loose, wore a tartan and had lots of weapons, and necklace made of fangs. (Certainly more impressive than Merida of ""Brave""). Also, I liked that the she-dragon had more to do than in the previous films. The family goes dragonriding (ripping off Anne McCaffrey's DragonRider novels). The dragon attacks the castle. The dragon falls in love with Donkey at the same time Fiona falls in love with Shrek. Give the dragon her own movie.
  The villain Rumpelstilskin is smarmy, childish, overly emotional and one-dimensional. A disappointing villain. Prefer the Rumpelstilskin of Once Upon a Time TV series. Harold and his Queen barely appear at all. They had one sequence where they go to Rumpelstilskin to get help and have all of their problems go away. They are then erased from that dimension. I wish there were more about the witches. They looked very interesting to me. Iliked them. Especially I like their costumes and their long black gloves.
  As usual way too many songs. Stop singing and get on with the story. But they also made fun of the previous Shrek films by having a Pied Piper as a bounty hunter and he makes all the ogres dance. Horrors! They get captured.  Dancing ogres! Lots of them. Funny sequence.
  Each of the Shrek films is about Shrek learning better--but he learns the same lesson each time: not to be selfish and learn to love others.",1399507200,,4614,4.546441495778046

4020237,4,B002ZG9904,"I admit when I first watched this at the theaters, I didn't really like it.  However, at that time, we were being bombarded with plenty of movies about the disenchantment of life, failing to appreciate what you have, blah-blah-blah.  It was just too much.

However, the second time around, I do like it.  It isn't my favorite of the Shrek series, but I still like it.  The plot is well developed, and all your favorite characters make an appearance.  There are also some new characters.  Aside from the failing to appreciate your life and getting disenchanted, it has an alternate reality thing going on.

Basic plot:  Shrek and Fiona live happily with their three little ones in the swamp.  They have lots of friends and are local celebrities.  Around the triplets' first birthday, Shrek is missing his bachelor days when he was feared.  Enter Rumplestiltskin, who looks a bit different than he did in Shrek 3.  He offers Shrek one day of freedom in exchange from one day from his childhood.  Unfortunately, for Shrek, Rumple takes the day he was born.  Suddenly Shrek is thrust into a world where Fiona was never rescued from the palace, Far Far Away is ruled by Rumple and his witches, and Puss N Boots is a fat pampered kept cat.  In order to break the contract, he has to get the hardened Fiona--now leader of an ogre resistance--to fall in love with him before the day runs out.",1390780800,,1384,4.610655737704918
4020238,4,B002ZG9904,"This volume of the Shrek saga captures a portion of all our lives as Shrek desires to return to a simpler period of his life without the day to day demands of being an Ogre family man. However, just like each of us, Shrek realizes just how meaningless such an existence is.",1390176000,,273,4.269230769230769
4020259,4,B002ZG9904,Some movies never go old. Some movies you can call the classic and even though this was the final installment of the Shrek series it is still one of the best. It was one time that the whole family sat down together and laughed.,1389830400,,227,4.181818181818182

4020264,5,B002ZG9904,"I try and review all of my purchases on Amazon but it gets frustrating when only the favorable ones are posted.  This seller earned a great review. This is the fourth installment in the Shrek series and my 8 year old's personal favorite.  Mike Myers and cast deliver excellent performances and the idea of Shrek having a ""its a wonderful life' kind of moment in time shows how clever the screenplay must have been.  You will enjoy seeing Fiona as a tough chick who leads a rebellion against none other than Rumblestilskin (probably spelling that wrong; sorry)  This is a good review so I imagine it will pass through though be aware this is just my opinion and Amazon tends to only post the favorable ones... Still.......... Great Seller and Deserves the recognition for the product and the fast ship!",1389052800,,801,4.7

4020268,4,B002ZG9904,The best of the series.  I love how they make these characters for parents to enjoy as well.

I really liked the premise and the action flowed together well. They included flashbacks from the first three movies, quickies to glue the series togther.

The animation, as always was top dollar. I thought the story line was well written and the music was fun, just like the other movies.

The hmm: This movie wasn't as funny as the original, nor did I feel it had the same overall charm. Shrek starts the movie feeling sorry for himself and an ogre having  pity party just isn't cool. The kids got bored half way through. I still like the original better.",1361750400,,576,4.275229357798165

I have all of your correspondence that you sent to me.  Never in the two emails had you offered to partially refund me.  Instead, you chose to be combative and say that you checked the dvd which is defective.  If you had good intentions to partially refund me as you stated you would have already refunded me by now.

You received that poor rating because your customer service and product was poor.  I will not change this feedback but I will notify Amazon and provide them our correspondence so they can see how unprofessional your company operates.  I have taken pictures of the packaging and video taped how this defective Shrek dvd skips, freezes, and does not play properly on 3 different dvd players.

If you want to really rectify this matter, refund me or send me a Shrek Forever After dvd that works properly.

------------- Begin message -------------

I offered a partial refund for you. Your feedback is unwarranted. Can you either remove your rating or adjust your rating. I communicated with you. Didn't ignore your message and subsequent messages, and even offered a resolution for you in the form of a partial refund. That is a lot to receive a rating of 1, which someone should revive if they flat out dismissed and didn't respond to your request.

------------- End message -------------
no i do not have a sensitive dvd player.  the dvd does not play properly.  it freezes and skips.  it could have been damaged during shipping because it was not shipped in an envelope but wrapped a few times in paper and then celephane.

if you do not have another, i am requesting a refund.

The original Shrek is our favorite (or mine, at least), mostly because of the plotting and dialogue. But Shrek Forever After is definitely in second place. At first, I didn't believe this installment was as humorous as the other films, but it actually is. What was throwing me off was the serious nature of the film. It felt like there were more dramatic moments, more of the mood-music, a lot more of our hero sulking in his unfortunate circumstances. But there are still plenty of moments to guffaw and slap your knee; they are simply mixed in with an eye-opening side of Shrek that I do not believe is expressed in the other three films.

Rumblestilskin I guess was thrown in just to blow the smoke off an old Disney name that has essentially been forgotten.  Unfortunately, he's brought to life as a snivily little looser who right from the get, you know is going to get nothing done.  When I compare his character to some of the Disney classics like Ursela, The Octopus Queen from The Little Mermaid, or Gaston from Beauty And The Beast... it's jaw dropping how little personality and punch Rumblestilskin was able to muster.  One might even suspect this movie had no editors at all as his character is clearly cutting room floor material at best.  ... that said, Shrek is still a classic and if you love the series, I'm sure you will find enough laughs here to warrant a rental or possibly an add to your collection for completions sake only.",1336435200,,1057,4.73224043715847

4020774,5,B002ZG9904,"This movie was a big surprise for me. I had heard several people say that it was better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-the-Third/dp/B000UVKGPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek the Third</a>, which was a positive thing to hear since that film was very forgettable. But I was skeptical nonetheless. The commercials had looked quite funny, but then again, so did the previews for Shrek the Third. So I finally watched this one and... it was very good.
I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. The creators of the film made some very smart decisions with this film and it made for a very fun and enjoyable watch. I think that this actually might be my favorite Shrek film.
In this film, Shrek is feeling overwhelmed by the monotonous duties and demands of fatherhood and celebrity-hood. The conniving Rumpelstiltskin offers Shrek the chance to relive the past and, thinking it a harmless deal, Shrek signs a contract and is flung into an alternate reality where he is once again a feared and horrible ogre.
As the Shrek film series has progressed, each film has become more crude and involved more pointless humor than it's predecessor. So, naturally, one would think that this film would be the most crude and most adult of the franchise. But it's not. The filmmakers decided to step away from the crude humor and focus their efforts on the story and the character development. The story plays off the idea of ""You don't know what you have until it's gone"" and we are treated to a very deep and very endearing story. We get to see layers of the characters that we never knew existed and we are actually touched by how charming and sentimental Shrek can actually be. This is very much a love story.
I think the creators did an excellent job of bringing the story full circle and ending the franchise with a very inspiring and moving story. The alternate characters we see in this film really give us a deeper look into the characters we know and love and takes the Shrek storyline to a much more personal level than we've seen before.
The animation is excellent, the voice performances are well done, and the musical score is superb. Good ol' Harry Gregson-Williams. This movie rose far beyond my expectations and was a real treat. Whether you are a Shrek fan or not, I think this is a movie definitely worth seeing.",1326499200,3,2390,4.874692874692875

This mess though, I mean...what is going on here?  There is no life in this fourth installment in the rapidly growing tired series.  There is some humor to be had, but this final (PLEASE LET THIS BE OGRE) film is just too dark, too repetitive and too bland for its own good.  I understand trying to spruce things up in certain areas with regards to narrative, but the formula used doesn't change and so shifting the story arcs a tad doesn't really create a new feel to the film.  The opening segment was pretty great, and it felt like the light airy fluff that permeated the first film was going to establish an entertaining treat, but that is soon stripped away to reveal a much darker and more sinister turn of events, which doesn't bode well for a film series that popped so much thanks to the brisk `fairytale' overtones.  The voice work is still very good, and the CGI animation is crisp with some stellar cinematography, but overall this film is a dud and certainly the worst in the series.

4020844,4,B002ZG9904,"`Shrek: Forever After' is the last instalment of this great animated series and I am glad to say it doesn't disappoint.

After the lack lustre `Shrek the Third' I was worried the format was getting a little tired, but thankfully this film is a worthy addition to the franchise.

This film sees Shrek, after he is tricked by Rumplestiltskin and he loses Fiona, try to correct his mistakes and make his life is own again.  We see more of his kids and what life is like as an ogre parent and this continues to poke fun at the whole fairytale genre as we have come to expect and love.

This still provides the excellent voice-over talents of Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy and we also get introduced to new characters like the Pied Piper, Rumplestiltskin and a host of witches.

There are plenty of jokes for the kids and enough for the adults to make this an enjoyable film for all involved.  It isn't as snappy or edgy as the first 2 films, but it is still an entertaining way to spend an evening.  All in all I'd say add it to your Shrek collection, you shouldn't be disappointed.

Dame Julie Andrews and John Cleese were somewhat under-used here, though, and swordfighting from would have been welcome here, those are my only complaints. Good entry in a series of highs and lows, which even out to a plain. Rated PG.",1310428800,,460,4.691358024691358
4020847,4,B002ZG9904,"As ""Shrek Ever After"" opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis.  Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.

In the be-careful-what-you-wish-for/you-don't-know-what-you've-got-till-it's-gone scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day.  We then get a new spin on ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born.  He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz) - the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres - to fall in love with him all over again.

Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing ""Shrek the Third"" from 2007, ""Shrek Ever After,"" directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did - which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business.  Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo.  Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate.  In fact the voiceover cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers:  Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King.

4020849,2,B002ZG9904,"The original Shrek animated film really seemed to offer a lot of promise for a potential franchise. It was a kids movie that was funny for both kids and adults, was way more clever than expected, and even had mild cursing that was both humorous and relevant. It was an animated film with a solid story that was entertaining for all ages and had that secret ingredient of heart to bring it all together. Unfortunately, the franchise seemed to slide further and further downhill from there. Shrek 2 was slightly amusing, but there weren't many laugh out loud moments. It was disappointing enough to make me skip Shrek the Third altogether. Which brings us to Shrek Forever After, the last Shrek film which serves more as a coup de grce and that final nail in the coffin rather than a satisfying conclusion to what was once a promising franchise.

The subtle humor used in the Shrek films has always been the high point for me, but the sequels seemed to use that humor less and less as the franchise went on. There are a few good uses of it in Shrek Forever After like Rumpelstiltskin's goose Fifi slowly ducking out of frame, the Queen locking the door to their carriage once they enter Rumpelstiltskin's sketchy neighborhood, and a fat Puss in Boots slowly sliding down his cat toy. But the sequels tend to be less about that kind of humor that reeled Shrek fans in to begin with and more about being cute or goofy while its execution feels underdeveloped or half-assed in the long run.

Shrek Forever After begins shortly before the first film takes place right before Shrek rescues Princess Fiona and meets Donkey. It's a little strange because Shrek Forever After could probably serve as a reboot of sorts since it changes the events of the first film albeit briefly. While the very fabric of the Shrek universe is shaken to its core, it doesn't really feel like finality. Events in the film wrap up in a way that is satisfying, but it tends to feel like just another sequel rather than proper closure.

The absolute highlight of the film is the montage of Shrek scaring all of the villagers after he signs the contract with Rumpelstiltskin. It's simple yet funny in its execution. It's probably the best rounded out segment of the film. Gingy tends to be pretty awesome in this one, too.

While the film looks its best on Blu-ray, the animation seemed like it was a level down in comparison to films like How to Train Your Dragon and Despicable Me. It's like Shrek animation isn't as smooth or fluid or something. Facial expressions do tend to shine in Shrek films though. Those are usually better and say more than half of the things that come out of the character's mouths these days. Donkey's hair was really detailed, as well. All of its matted and tangled glory takes a front seat on Blu-ray.

Shrek Forever After does have glimpses of hilarity and solidarity, but mostly comes off as halfhearted. The sequels could never really put together the same formula that made the first film so entertaining. Although mildly cute, slightly entertaining, and rather profitable, Shrek Forever After will more than likely help you understand why the franchise ended rather than reminisce about Shrek's previous adventures.",1307318400,2,3219,4.730837789661319

This time, Shrek goes through a midlife crisis and makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin for a day as a truly wild ogre. However, Rumpelstiltskin tricks him into undoing his entire life and marriage. The movie gets to introduce new fairy tale themes and motifs. I love the look of the rebel ogres. The Pied Piper also has a cool role. The best part is seeing some of the characters get a darker, meaner streak. Gingy becomes a gladiator fighting animal crackers.

I think it's unfair for movie-goers to have such increasingly higher expectations of modern films, so high that people offer less-positive reviews if the material isn't groundbreaking. It's as if we must be taken as far as one can possibly go or we are not satisfied. This movie exceeded my expectations (having seen Shrek movies before) and brought back some beloved characters with some funny new story lines.

This movie was wonderfully animated, had many good lines, and had a re-occuring welcomed time-tested Hollywood theme--good versus evil, the prince and princess will find each other in the end, and all will be well if we become self-aware. I like to see movies that consistently offer a good story, good acting, and hopeful messages. Thanks to Dreamworks, the actors, and the animators for providing another nice journey into this world. I am sorry that it is the last because journeying with these familiar characters has been quite enjoyable.",1304380800,,1173,4.924242424242424

4021037,4,B002ZG9904,"I think ""Shrek Forever After"" is better than ""Shrek the Third,"" though not as good as the first two feature films of the series ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2."" ""Shrek Forever After"" is an engaging film, but not in the same was as the first ""Shrek"" was.

In the fourth installment Shrek is a family man, who should be happy and content with his peaceful life with Fiona and the kids. Deep in his mind, however, he longs for the good, old days when he was feared by people as ""ogre,"" living alone in the swamp. That is when scheming Rumpelstiltskin offers him a deal: to let Shrek live like a real ogre for one day. All Shrek has to do is give just one day of his life to Rumpelstiltskin.

Of course, there is a catch, which you should see for yourself. The film's tone gets surprisingly serious (the party scene and frustrated Shrek, for example), but thankfully the creators know the film is meant to entertain, not to preach.

The idea of Shrek and midlife crisis will not appeal to younger audiences, but the original Shrek made about nine years ago was not exactly a film for kids, either. Anyway, the fourth Shrek offers a lot of action and jokes, and they are certainly entertaining and funny, but the witty and pointed humor, for which the Oscar-winning first ""Shrek"" is recognized, is sadly missing. ""Shrek Forever After"" is a classic case of ""good, not great.""",1297382400,,1359,4.516260162601626
4021038,5,B002ZG9904,"In the first ""Shrek"" film, our title character had to accept himself; in 2, he had to accept family; and in 3, he had to accept responsibility. In the closing chapter ""Shrek Forever After"", the lesson is clear cut: You don't know what you've got until it's gone. Shrek (given heart & soul by the great Mike Myers) learns this the hard way when his seemingly idyllic life becomes one long broken record of diaper changes, swamp maintenances, and cutesy dinner table stories. Soon feeling trapped in his own life (and longing for the ""good old days"" as a terrifying ogre), he longs for a way out. Enter the devious Rumpelstiltskin (played with gleeful villainy by Walt Dohrn) who talks Shrek into signing an ""ogre for a day"" contract. Relishing his newfound freedom, it all turns sour: A deceitful character such as Rumpel' cleverly weaves repercussions into the contract, and Shrek's world is quickly turned upside down as Donkey (Eddie Murphy again, hilarious as usual) can't fathom a friendship between ogre & donkey; Puss 'n Boots (the suave voice of Antonio Banderos) is now domesticated and morbidly obese; and his beloved Fiona (the terrific Cameron Diaz) is the unlikely leader of an ogre resistance. Worse, Rumpel' has used loopholes to seize & rule The Land of Far, Far Away. So again, it's up to our unlikely hero Shrek to save the day & restore order to his life.
The story borrows a page from ""It's A Wonderful Life"", except completely done over, Shrek style. There's a parade of notable voice talent here (as well as The Pied Piper, who has no lines & warbles on his flute instead). And, of course, the animation is excellent.
So is it good? Well, I thought SFA falls somewhere in the middle; it's not quite as good as parts 1 & 2, but certainly better than the hit & miss part 3. The opening bit with Shrek's mundane life repeating itself faster & faster is amusing, and the closing credits--cleverly montaging scenes from the earlier films--is a cute & touching farewell, reminding us where the series has been.
Extras include deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and cast & crew interviews.
So long, Shrek! It was great knowing you!",1297209600,,2158,4.7727272727272725
4021087,4,B002ZG9904,"The Shrek movies have been walking a slow decline from the hit of the first movie. By the time the third one came out people were just tired of the story and its failure did not do the sequels any good. As my family podered watching the fourth movie I remembered hearing very bad reviews of it. We watched it anyway and loved it. This movie, even though the story was different, was the most appropriate for the age group of children watching it. There was no cursing or suggestive material at all. It was nice to watch a kids movie and not wonder if my children caught that bad word or understood that sexual joke. The moral of the story was a home run also. It's a great lesson to learn that you should not take for granted what you have. Kids fall into that the most. They always want more and better and whatever their friends have. It is a hard lesson to learn that when you lose something it might just be the best thing you ever had. Maybe some people have gotten tired of the on-going story of Shrek and Fiona but if you look deeper into it you can see how great it is.

Shrek is unhappy with his new life as a father since the life has become routine and he has lost his identity as an ogre. He is lured into a contract with Rumpelstiltskin to have a chance to be a real ogre again. As contracts go with Rumpel, there is a twist and he has to figure out a way to get out of the contract in a day.

4021145,4,B002ZG9904,"SHREK FOREVER AFTER blew up the box office, so I don't know if the filmmakers can stick to their vow of this being the last film in the franchise. But this fourth entry is an improvement over the last one, SHREK THE THIRD. Much as I enjoyed SHREK THE THIRD, it lacked the freshness and wicked punch of the first two Shrek pictures. SHREK FOREVER AFTER resurrects some of that old sparkle.

Familial bliss apparently doesn't suit Shrek. Now a domesticated swamp ogre, he feels down in the dumps. A loving wife to wake up to, three adorable triplets to spoil - these kids being ogres, the ""adorable"" bit may be subjective - and his fairy tale pals to hang out with. And yet Shrek misses the good old days, back when he used to terrorize the villagers and those villagers used to chase him with pitchforks and torches. On his children's first birthday bash, he's treated like a tame monster, like a party trick, one brat prodding him over and over to ""Do the roar."" This is altogether improper behavior accorded towards a proper ogre. And so Shrek finally loses it.

Tearing out of the birthday party, Shrek stumbles onto Rumpelstiltskin rooting around in the trash. Rumpelstiltskin, that little man whose specialty is magical transactions, has seen better days. He had a shot once upon a time to rule the kingdom of Far Far Away, coming this close to having Princess Fiona's royal parents sign away the kingdom to him... that is, until Shrek came along and rescued Fiona from her tower. Today Rumpelstiltskin eyes Shrek and seizes opportunity. Shrek yearns for just one day in which he still had his bad ogre mojo, 24 hours in which he can have his old life back. Rumpelstiltskin offers him this one day, in exchange for one day from Shrek's past. Shrek signs the contract, doesn't read the fine print. Silly ogre.

Shrek gets his wish, finds that folks are once again terrified of him. And then it dawns on him, horrifyingly, that he's now in an alternate reality. One in which Rumpelstiltskin governs Far Far Away as a police state, with covens of hag witches serving as his minions. That day from Shrek's past that Rumpelstiltskin took? It's the day Shrek was born. And so everything that Shrek had ever done has become undone. And after his 24 hours are spent, Shrek is doomed to fade away from existence. His only hope is the escape clause which hinges on Shrek's planting true love's kiss on someone.

I love me some alternate reality stories, and I think SHREK FOREVER AFTER shines in exploiting this premise. There are some wonderful sight gags. Lots of fun in seeing how familiar characters are re-imagined in this darker reality. It's pretty funny, what's happened to Gingy (the Gingerbread Man) and Puss in Boots. In an interesting twist, Shrek, the grumpy ogre, now finds himself having to befriend Donkey and Puss n Boots all over again. But his biggest challenge is in romancing Princess Fiona, now become a rebel warrior. She doesn't think much of Shrek.

This movie has its darker elements, and the modern fractured fairy tale aesthetics are still around. By now these familiar voice actors can do this in their sleep, and there's a sense of comfort in listening to them do their thing (I think Mike Meyers is now known more for playing Shrek than for starring in the WAYNE'S WORLD films). We get two new and noteworthy characters. Rumpelstiltskin makes a terrific villain, vain and insecure and suffering from little man complex. The Pied Piper never does say a word, but he's a memorable gent, anyway. Ultimately, SHREK FOREVER AFTER re-energizes the franchise, mostly because it presents a different perspective.

4021148,3,B002ZG9904,"I really have mixed feelings about this one. Typically when any successful trilogy spews out a 4th film, it's a disaster. It's a simple case of ""We're not done making money off this franchise yet..."" and they end up shooting themselves in the foot. But with Shrek I felt the third installment was the terrible one, and although ""Forever After"" was better, it was still just okay.

Shrek's story was told in the first movie... then it was retold in the second movie, just in a different environment with some fun new characters (I enjoyed it)... the third movie was overkill, tired, and not very memorable. When I heard they were making a fourth, I cringed.

In this installment Shrek has become bored with his life and gets tricked into an alternate universe which would be their world had he never existed.

Ugh! Back to mixed feelings! In my opinion, the ""alternate reality"" angle is cheating. It's been done! It's an easy way to make more money off of a preexisting story. Continuity rules are pretty easy to follow, and there is little challenge to plotting out the story when you give yourself a clean slate to work with. On the other hand, this story was clever, and entertaining enough to bookend the mostly redundant 2nd and 3rd movies.

If you already have the first three Shreks, then by all means, get this one and complete the set. If you are not a fan, or have not seen the other three, then don't bother.

The story could have been great, with lots of parallel universe references to mock other 20th century and fairy tale legends, but that opportunity was missed. The story concerns Shriek wishing he was his old self again, then when given that opportunity realising it's wrong for him, so he want to restore normality.

Rumpelstiltskin, as the villan, was very lame, and had no onscreen persona, or any beleivable reason why he was the bad guy (other than Napoleon syndrome).

Oh wait, no not all. Who do you think you are? Some can enjoy the movie in 3D, those who decided to go out to buy a new Samsung 3D TV. What if you don't want to buy a Samsung, what if you like Sony or Toshiba, well, then you are out of luck my friend. This is another exclusive deal, again limiting the amount of content available to all consumers. By limiting this amount, you are getting less and less people interested in buying a 3D TV. The only reason I see in doing this is to sabotage their own product, create a black market item (Shrek goes for $150, Avatar is being sold on Amazon through an outside reseller at $300), and push people into piracy. Way to go guys! If the content is available but you make it too expensive or to hard to get, they will turn to piracy (think of the music industry). That is why I am boycotting all the titles that were available first in exclusive deals. I will never buy Avatar, Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon, and so on either DVD, Blu-Ray, or 3D Blu-Ray. The people behind these movies talked about how great 3D is, (James Cameron & Jeffrey Katzenberg) that people should enjoy the movie in this type of presentation and yet, they made backhanded deals in the end, so very few people may enjoy them.

4021520,1,B002ZG9904,"I like the first Shrek, LOVE the second one and the third one is right up this with my favorite movies.

This...this is along the same caliber of Return of Jafar. Having the same voice cast is not the only thing you need for a good movie, plot and continuity - something the directors of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the first three Shrek Movies and many other sequels - have managed.

This movie is boring and predicable, and not particularly funny. As an adult I enjoyed the other three movies - this one was frustrating. NOTHING lined up with the other movies. Shrek didn't exist and that made Far Far Away change forever. Shrek wasn't a huge part of Far Far Away until he rescued Fiona. In the second movie the King knew that Prince Charming would - eventually - rescue Fiona because he had promised it to the Fairy Godmother.

The only reason Puss in Boots was associated with Fiona was because of Shrek, the King never would have met Puss if Shrek hadn't married Fiona and stood in the way of Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother. See where I'm going with this? And when Shrek met Fiona she was so caught up in the ""my prince will rescue me"" bit that it's not even plausible that she would have tried to escape. Last but not least, Rumplestiltskin was IN Shrek 3, in one of the Tavern scenes with Prince Charming.

I saw this movie in the theatre and I left extremely disappointed. I bought the other three movies individually - there is no way I'd waste my money on this garbage. I'd rather buy the third Aladdin movie from Disney.

If you're a devoted Shrek fan because of the humor that adults and kids can enjoy, great plot and a good romance, this isn't the movie for you. If you just want another Shrek movie - here you go.",1293926400,2,1744,4.37037037037037

Firstly there is Shrek and His Family riding along with Donkey and his family. What is really cute about this scene are the small Donkey/Dragon kids that are flying alongside their mother. It has all the makings of a cool high flying family outing.

Next there is the action scene where Shrek is riding a witch's broom. He is being chased by a bunch of witches that are hurling bombs at him through various corridors and levels of a vast castle. It reminded me a bit of the final action sequence in the very first Star Wars movie (Episode 4).

Finally Shrek and Fiona go into a sort of high flying circus act to tie up the dragon (Donkey's wife in the alter universe).

In my opinion all these high flying action sequences make this movie well worth the watch!",1293840000,,867,4.468354430379747

4021566,5,B002ZG9904,"This fourth intallment of Shrek, SHREK FOREVER AFTER, is, IMHO, the best of the Shrek films.  The fun is back (minus the juvenile potty humor that invaded the 2nd and 3rd films), the story is delightful, and the message is clear.  My kids (13 1/2 and 5 1/2) both loved this movie, as did my husband and I.

SHREK FOREVER AFTER is based losely on the story from ""It's A Wonderful Life.""  Here, we find that our favorite ogre is confused by his new role in the kingdom.  He used to live a solitary life, scaring people and doing whatever he felt like doing; now he has a family, responsibilities, and is viewed as a folk hero.  In a fit of frustration, Shrek wishes that he could be a regular ogre and live his former life, just for a day.  Rumplestiltskin overhears his wish and tricks Shrek into trading his ""ogre day"" for the day he was born.  Shrek finds that he never rescued Fiona, he never had a family, never met his friends, and that he will diappear at the end of his ogre day.  But there is a way out of his contract with Rumplestiltskin.  Can true love still conquer all and save the day?

SHREK FOREVER AFTER is cute, fun, and charming family entertainment.  The animation is beautiful, vibrant, and vivid, the story is engaging, and all our favorite voice actors are back.  The message of being happy with what you have is perfect, and is understood by children of all ages.

SHREK FOREVER AFTER has heart, and should not be missed.  If this is the final installment, then SHREK FOREVER AFTER is truly the perfect way to end the franchise.",1293667200,3,1551,4.411971830985915

In an age when approximately half of American marriages end in divorce, do you and your children really need to see Shrek going through a mid-life crisis and getting away from his wife and three small children?

There are NO real laughs in the whole film--unless you're the sort of person who finds the pain of decent characters funny. The main plot is an uneven rollercoaster ride of Shrek's effort to undo a decision he regrets--with dozens of major obstacles thwarting him until the moment when he is literally vanishing into nothingness. SPOILER ALERT: in the final seconds, all is made right--BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT ANYWAY, DIDN'T YOU?

The film's villain--Rumpelstiltskin, who repeatedly succeeds against Shrek until the final seconds--resembles Jack Black in TROPIC THUNDER (and some other films) and even sounds and acts very much like him.

The only scenes that my family enjoyed at all were those involving Puss in Boots (now obese, as the previews/trailers show). Puss still has some charm. These scenes are the sole reason I am not rating this film  ""one star"" or ""F.""

The GOOD news for my family is that we merely rented this film. I would strongly recommend that nobody buy it without first doing likewise. It is always possible that you will love this film and wish to watch it over and over--but it is very very VERY unlikely.",1293235200,4,1481,4.765625

He has a wonderful wife, three great kids, and friends who adore him, but he is still not happy. The day-to-day grind of parenthood is getting to him and he misses his careful ogre life from before he settled down with Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz). While in an angry mood, he makes a bad deal with Rumpelstiltskin (voiced by Walt Dohrn) and loses everything he loves - including himself. He is lost in the world that would have existed if he was never born and the only way out is to make Fiona fall in love with him again. But Fiona is now a man hating she-warrior battling Rumpelstiltskin for control of Far Far Away land. So Shrek has a hard battle ahead of him to win Fiona's love.

This sequel is the most exciting of the Shrek series. It contains tons of action, great jokes, and wonderful music.

4021799,3,B002ZG9904,"Not hard to remember 2001 when the original ""Shrek"" came out.  It beat my favorite Disney/Pixar film ""Monsters Inc"" for the 1st Best Animated Film Oscar.

An original idea and funny.  The 1cd film was very good, not quite as good as the original.

The 3rd film was NOT anywhere near as good as the first two films.  The Arthur character & how it was written.

So, we get to this film.  Supposed to be the last ""Shrek"" film  That will remain to be seen.

NOT an original idea seeing what would happen if.  That has surely been done before, so the character see how good they have it after complaining about it.

I say this for positive, I thought the film would be worse.  Just the laughs are far between.  .  Notice the Arthur character they brought in for the 3rd film is NOT EVEN TALKED ABOUT HERE.  Took a while to get to any good Donkey or Puss scenes.

The funny side characters from the first three films were barely used.  Minor Pinocchio, Dragon, Gingy, etc.

OK, THEY STOLE THE END OF BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Spoiler, the kiss.

A few extras on here.  DVD DESIGNED YOU ARE FORCED TO WATCH PREVIEWS INSIDE OF GOING TO THE MENU.

Just so you have to buy another & they make more money.

To sum up.  This film is the worst of the four films.  It is watchable BUT no where close to the original 2001 film.",1291939200,,1530,4.211805555555555

Kudos for continuation of the original cast through all 4 Shrek movies.
""Shrek Forever After"" is not as striking and not as captivating as the first three Shrek movies.  It is tough to make that many movies with the same characters and the same people, yet keep it fresh and alive.  But there are some nice elements introduced, such as the ogre underground, the witch horde, and Rumpelstiltskin of course.  I was surprised though that there wasn't an outcry from liberals, diversity, or ethnicity rights groups.  You might say lighten up - this is just a cartoon.  You must not have seen the media frenzy over 2009's ""The Princess And The Frog.""  In today's world there is no end to how some people believe we want to know their opinion and bias on everything, and how the world owes them some kind of apology.
Which takes us right into the impetus of ""Shrek Forever After,"" a time in Shrek's life when he's tired of the adult responsibility of coping with everybody and everything around him; whether or not he feels like it.  The little kid's name is Butterpants, who keeps taunting Shrek to, ""Do the roar!""
What ensues is Shrek getting his wish and everything and everybody changes.  A little bit along the theme of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (with James Stuart), this latest Shrek movie lets Shrek find out how much of a difference he makes in the lives of his inner circle of friends and family.  At least in ""Shrek Forever After,"" the characters don't remind each other constantly about how different they are from each other, yet demand acceptance regardless of whether or not each friend is trying to contribute equitably.  It is instead a camaraderie romp of solidarity and unity bearing out what team work can accomplish if everybody carries out their respective roles of opportunity and service.
The social demographics of this piece however, are bent.  The first three Shrek movies didn't scream it as loudly my direction, and for the most part were entertainment as the movie's primary purpose.  This time Shrek 4 almost comes across as politically correct rhetoric, admonishing the viewing audience to tolerate others without boundaries or personal space imposed by us as individuals in some reasonable balance.  We see greed, irresponsibility, immaturity, contrasting personalities, and self-inflated egos all but out of control; yet Shrek is made to feel bad when those things give him a sense of imbalance and he wants to speak out against the compromise being predominantly his own, and very little give and take occurring back his direction.  Shrek 4 teaches us to conduct ourselves humbly and keep our place, knowing that poor, uneducated, and underpaid working class people living in neighborhoods lacking security should be grateful for what little we do have and remember we could lose even what little we have if we aren't careful to just shut up and take it.
I would rather have seen a movie where Shrek and Fiona have a lucky break or are generously offered opportunity to better themselves and enjoy a higher lifestyle at the end of the day - and all their friends get to upgrade alongside them, too.
Ultimately though, I'm going to have to admit I like the dragon that donkey is married to, Fiona has some nice choreography and exploitation of the female aspects of Fiona are well done, and Shrek's character wasn't necessarily compromised.  I was glad too about how Puss in Boots wasn't totally helpless just because he has middle-age spread from retirement life.  Donkey and Puss in Boots have a verbal exchange that is good, but a bit too short.  Some of the animation is interestingly life-like for the coven of witches, and Pinocchio continues to be an obvious favorite.  The gingerbread man sequences fighting like a gladiator with animal crackers was pretty well done, and the concept of the Pied Piper was interesting (you can't tell me there isn't a trainload of psychological implication going on there).
There are many celebrities with bit part voice roles; Larry King, Regis Philbin, Ryan Seacrest, Kathy Griffin, and others you may recognize, other than the more popularly recognized headliner main characters.
I'm going to say I recommend this film with 4 stars as far as being worth seeing, but worth 5 stars as far as owning - to complete your set of all 4 Shrek series movies.  The first three films were geared more to connoisseurs of fairy tale lore and the realm of make believe as references in jokes and puns.  This 4th Shrek movie seems to focus more upon purpose, not so much upon nostalgic humor.  DreamWorks still spent $165 million to produce ""Shrek Forever After,"" and before it was released to DVD format, this 4th Shrek film has grossed over $737 million.
I like ""Shrek Forever After"" more than several others in the theaters this year, whether or not DreamWorks was involved.  Shrek is going to be a leader in animation for many years to come, whether or not in the fairy tale genre.",1291852800,3,5110,4.842709529276694

After suffering through the third movie, Dreamworks must have realized their mistake, and said:
""Hey, let's make a fourth Shrek movie to apologize for making the third movie..."" And yes, this apology, ""Shrek Forever After/The Final Chapter"" was very much accepted.
Like the third one, this movie hit it big with the kiddies, but also had more for the adults, delivering it through the movie's message. It was also the first Shrek tear-jerker.
Over all, this was a good way to end the Shrek franchise.
I'd recommend buying this movie when it comes out because it's pretty enjoyable.",1286841600,2,691,4.815126050420168
4021853,5,B002ZG9904,"Shrek Forever After is one of my favourite films in the world! It is the best Shrek yet. The movie is kind of based on Its A Wonderful Life. Shrek is getting bored of his life, so he goes and finds a short strange fellow. Rumpelstilskon. He starts to like him and he gets Shrek to sign a contract. For one day, Shrek enters a world if he was 'never born'. Which ends up Donkey working for wiches, puss in boots gets fat, and most importantly,Fiona was never rescued from the tower! She rescued herself! She is now a queen ogre with tons of working ogers fighting for their freedom. Shrek falls in love with her again and Fiona saves Shreks life.

4021855,5,B002ZG9904,"Among one of my family favorites, I would have to say that the latest installment of Shrek, the Final Chapter was the most enjoyable.  Great for all age ranges, this enchanting story applies the theory of be careful what you wish for, and enjoy what life has given you , in the fullest.

Our tale, as it begins, is Shrek and Fiona savoring the glory of their wedded bliss.  Their trio of tykes are adorable, following in their father's footsteps and inciting numerous giggles among the younger audience.  Shrek, though, is unhappy. He begins to suffer from that quintessential male dilemma that he has lost himself in his wedded life, the frightening ogre now reduced to nothing more than a daddy and an overall lovable monster.

Even in this cartoon world, there is always someone who harbors ill will to our green hero.  Rumplestilken makes an interesting foe, intent on granting one's hearts desire  for a simple little payment that is hidden in the fine print of his contracts.  Shrek, downhearted as he is about his lost past, falls prey to the miniature devil in disguise.  What happens next, in Shrek's newly obtained world, is a surprise for everyone. I will have to admit that Antonio Banderas, again, steals the scene as Puss In Boots!

I would highly recommend this latest installment of Shrek to everyone that enjoys a good family movie.",1283040000,2,1349,4.775862068965517

4021857,4,B002ZG9904,"My friends and I saw Shrek 3, but none of us can remember much of anything about it.  To me, that's the sign of a bad movie.

We saw Shrek 4 awhile ago.  The plot reminds me of Back to the Future, set in a fairy tale world.  Shrek is having a mid-life crisis when his married life with Fiona and children seems far too repetitive.  He wishes he would live one day again as an ogre.

Enter Rumpelstiltskin.  Upon signing on the dotted line, Shrek is transported to a different world.  At first, he has a lot of fun being, well, an ogre---terrorizing the populace and the likes.  But, eventually, he realizes that, unless he wins Fiona's love at the end of the day (and she doesn't know him), he will cease to exist.

However, Rumpelstiltskin isn't about to let THAT happen.  In this brave new world, he is the evil ruler, with an army of pumpkin throwing witches.  And he will do anything to prevent Shrek from winning Fiona's love.

At first, it appears he doesn't need much help, since Fiona doesn't know him and only values combat skill, as she is now a warrior (picture an ogre Valkyrie).

It is hilarious seeing a pudgy Puss in Boots, and Donkey has some classic funny scenes.  Overall, it is a far better Shrek movie than the third, but not up to the standards of the first or second.

It's a lot of fun to watch but not necessarily a must own.",1279411200,,1349,4.2936507936507935
4021858,3,B002ZG9904,"Shrek Forever After is the fourth and supposedly final entry in the series of films chronicling the comical adventures of a green ogre by the name of Shrek.  The first film released in 2001 was an instant hit.  In 2004 it was followed by Shrek 2 which was also a delightfully entertaining animated-comedy.  Then in 2007 the series took a misstep with Shrek the Third which was forgettable to say the least.  Now we have Shrek Forever After which, though not as bad as Shrek the Third, still doesn't measure up to the first two entries in the series.

There isn't much of a plot to Shrek Forever After.  It follows the basic `It's a Wonderful Life' formula of trying to show how the world would be if Shrek was never born.  To me this doesn't seem like a good idea for a Shrek film because it doesn't expand the story what-so-ever because you know by the end of the film things will go back to normal without any change except for Shrek having a better understanding of who he is.  They could have still provided that message without such a generic plot.  In fact, given the scenario they chose I felt incredibly disappointed that we didn't get to see other characters from the series.  What about Lord Farquaad or the Fairy Godmother?  How does Shrek never existing affect this?  We'll never know because the script is so narrow-minded that it does little to expand on the concept of Shrek never being born.

Speaking of villains, Rumpelstiltskin (voice of Walt Dohrn) doesn't really measure up compared to the antagonists of the first two films.  Okay, he's a step up from Prince Charming in Shrek the Third, but that doesn't take much.

On the bright side the film still keeps the primary voice-actors.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy both get in some good lines as is expected from the two SNL veterans.  Most of the other members of the cast aren't used enough to leave an impression so I have nothing much to say on them.

So: is Shrek Forever After a wreck?  Well, to be honest it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be coming into the theater, but it still is a letdown.  Some lines got a chuckle out of me, but for the most part Shrek Forever After pandered to younger members of the audience and robbed jokes from the previous entries in the franchise.

Is it a good note for the Shrek franchise to end on?  No.  If this were a perfect world Shrek would have ended on Shrek 2.  Is this movie good for children?  I'd imagine so.  There's nothing in here that's bad for kids, and it does have its clever moments, just not at the same level of quality as the first two films.

7/10 stars.  Worth seeing if you have children but don't expect the same quality as Shrek and Shrek 2.",1276819200,8,2694,4.398785425101215

4021860,3,B002ZG9904,"In the fourth and last installment of the Shrek franchise, Shrek (Mike Myers) finds himself becoming tired of his ""domesticated"" life when the routines of married life and fatherhood meet with the constant bombardment of fame and somewhat annoying friends. After storming out of his son's first birthday party Shrek runs into Rumplestiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who learns of Shrek's desires to be the ogre he once was and offers him a magical contract that would allow him to be an true ogre for a day, in exchange for one thing. In that exchange, though, Shrek gets much more than he bargained for.

When the first Shrek came out it was a brilliant anti-fairy tale fairy tale. Openly lampooning Disney movies and theme parks, Shrek was a fresh take on the animated fairy tale where the main characters didn't live happily ever after as picture perfect prince and princess, but as ogres, typically the scourge of any fairy tale. Since then two other Shrek movies have come out, and rather than embracing the counter culture of the first film, the franchise bought into it's own hype and into pop culture and lost the spirit of the original. While not bad films, they were unnecessary and even sapped some of the brilliance of the original. Now with the finale of Shrek in theaters, how does it stand up?

More-so than it's predecessors Shrek Forever After tries to come back home to more of the feeling of the first film. Even the plot of the film of Shrek's desire to go back to being a lone ogre on the outskirts of society seems to echo what the filmmakers were desiring to accomplish in picking a premise that allowed them to nearly replicate some of the situations of the first movie. That's one of the strengths of the film is that you get to re-meet the characters in a new fashion and in slightly new characterizations than previous which amps up the fun of this film compared to the previous films.

Reaching into an alternate universe has allowed the writers, and the actors, to revision the characters adding to the freshness of this installment in the series. Fiona is now a warrior, leading an ogre rebellion against the king. Donkey, while still the over talkative, funny if slightly annoying sidekick he's a little more wary and a bit brighter than he was in Shrek's real world. Puss has let himself go, and won't even chase a mouse that's sharing his milk. The real surprise here is Walt Dohrn, a writer/storyboard artist who makes his vocal film debut as the voice of the film's baddie, Rumplestiltskin. Everyone does a great job with their vocal work, but Walt and his character steal the show.

But for all the good, you can't go home, and Shrek doesn't quite go home either. Compared to the first film this one feels a little tame, sterile. First off, the premise makes this almost seem like a remake of the first film, causing it to loose some of it's freshness. On top of that there's a moral that really stands out, which is something I don't recall being aware of while watching the first three Shrek films, even though it was there.

All in all, I would highly recommend this film. Easily it's the second best of the four Shrek films. Each of the three sequels were unnecessary, but this was definitely a higher note to go out on than the last two films. If they had to go through sequels, I'm not sure they could have asked for a better film to go out on. If you've watched the last couple of Shrek films and found yourself to be disappointed give this a try, it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first film but it gets closer than the other sequels.
