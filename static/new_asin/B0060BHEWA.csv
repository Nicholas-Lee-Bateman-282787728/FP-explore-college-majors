8490328,1,B0060BHEWA,Awful movie with an actual Drac and Renfield. Sex scenes censored.,1502841600,,66,5.090909090909091
8490329,5,B0060BHEWA,"Have this movie under its original title, thought it was the long promised sequel. Not so, but a better transfer than the old one. It is a good movie, so I recommend it",1455235200,,168,4.121212121212121
8490330,1,B0060BHEWA,"I've seen this film before and wanted to re-watch it. I was severely disappointed because all of the ""fun parts"" were edited out. I guess I should have expected as much coming from a family-friendly place medium, so that was my mistake. A warning of such would have been appreciated so I wouldn't have wasted my money on the rental or the time spent watching waiting for it to get good. Somewhat low-budget entertainment anyways.",1434326400,4,429,4.733333333333333
8490331,4,B0060BHEWA,This movie is so bad its funny....The guy who plays Reinfeild reminds me of a Patient I had a few years ago..he makes the movie.......,1433289600,,134,4.4

8490333,2,B0060BHEWA,I definitely thought this was a B rated movie.,1405468800,,46,4.222222222222222
8490334,1,B0060BHEWA,"This Movie was a complete waste of time and money. The lead Actress seemed bored, disinterested and appeared to be uncomfortable with such a lame role. The Movie is not scary, the actors try to be funny but the jokes are stupid and lame. A really annoying sound track makes this movie difficult to watch even if the acting had been better. Don'e waste Your money on this piece of crap. Has brief nudity, not complete frontal and not in an appealing or sexy way.",1391472000,3,461,4.435294117647059
8490335,5,B0060BHEWA,"An appealing B movie with Count William Smith, need I say more? See why William Smith makes a great Vampire.",1376956800,,108,4.45
