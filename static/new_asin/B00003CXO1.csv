1280535,5,B00003CXO1,"What a funny movie...
The movie is about a normal and nice guy Greg, playes by Ben Stiller who is about to ask his long time love to marry him. He goes all out to ask, even having a large group of children holding up a sign that says ""Marry Me Pam"", but it fell through before he could show her because she said her father would of wanted to ""Meet"" him first.
So, Greg must postpone his showing of the ring and his love until he can meet her parents. He goes all out for Pam, he quits ""try's to"" smoking, just so he could be with her. One the that really ""helps"" is the suitcase that he put the ring in, was lost in carrier while on the plane.
Once they make it to the house, the mother instantly welcomes him into their home, offering him anything needs just like family. However on the other side, the father is anything but welcoming. Robert Dinero Plays the Dad like a champ. Making you hate him one minute and the other you know he is just being a good dad.
Well, after Greg meets the parents the rest of the family comes around. One thing I failed to mention was the it was Pam's sister's wedding and Greg thought it would be a good idea to ask the father's permission then and there. Well they kind of rub there money in Greg's face and make him the odd man out.
When they go over to the best man's lavish house, who is also Pam's ex-lover, everyone is not the nicest to Greg, as you could gather. In on eof the funniest scenes in the ENTIRE movie, first off Greg did not have any shorts to swim in so Pam's ex let him borrow a pair of his, which were a pair of speedos! When he came out of the dressing room. lets just say he was a little big, while they are playing volleyball or whatever in the pool, Greg's team is riding him about the spike play, they want him to do it, so when the Dad lines up, Greg gets a peice of it and spike it, right at Pam's sister's face! A large amount of blood just kept gushing out, ""Think There's Something About Mary"", it was great!
Well there was so much more I could talk about, this movie was really good. I wonder what it woud of been like if it was R? That would of been cool. I just think it was a great movie. Ben Stiller keeps poping out new and good films. This is a must see.
When it comes out on DVD, I will get it and then review it again. I hope the features complement it.
Well, that is about it...Hope my review helps either way,  Ryan",970963200,5,2393,4.016771488469602

The dynamic between Greg (Ben Stiller) and Jack (Robert De Niro) really carries this movie, with one misfortune or misunderstanding after another leading to some pretty funny situations that (thankfully) never feel completely over-the-top. That fact alone broadens the appeal of this movie, arguably even to the point that I'd probably recommend it to people who generally aren't so into comedies.",1441843200,2,534,5.445783132530121

I really believe that this is one of Ben Stiller's better movies.  Watching him make a fool out of himself is quite funny.  This is a great movie to add to anybody's collection.  Don't miss the two sequels of this movie.  They add even more hilarity to this already hilarious movie.

Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro deliver Superb acting performances, and the rest of the cast is also very good at the roles they play.

Ben Stiller plays the role as a male nurse, an R.N. who plans on proposing to his girlfriend over the weekend. However, he must ask permission first from her father, who is played by Robert DeNiro. At her parent's home, ex-CIA future father-in-law is looking very hard to dig deep into his future son-in-laws past. He is determined to find bad things, because he doesn't approve his daughter marrying this guy.

The weekend turns into a complete nightmare for Ben, and the harder he tries to be impressive, the worse he looks. There are moments of laugh-out-loud scenes, and the movie entertains until the end. An enjoyable, funny, fun movie. Highly entertaining!",1415232000,,972,4.779761904761905

Ben Stiller gives a super performance, as expected, and Deniro is outstanding as the now retired and ever stiff and humorless CIA officer who refuses to leave the clandestine life behind.  The interaction and play between the two is hilarious.  The series of unfortunate events that befall Stiller's character as he meets the in-laws is never ending.  If there's a weakness to the movie, it may be that those never ending events get a little over-the-top sometimes, but the hilarity of it all far overshadows that minor point.

It features Ben Stiller as Gaylord 'Greg' Fokker and Teri Polo as his fiancee, Pam Byrnes.  Although they have been together for awhile, he has not met his future in laws.  This movie centers around their trip to do just that.

Robert DeNiro stars as father-in-law to be Jack Byrnes and Blythe Danner is Dina, his wife.  Byrnes is a formidable character and a nightmare for any potential son-in-law.  He thinks no one is good enough for his baby and Fokker is certainly no exception.  The dynamics between these two are priceless.  DeNiro really steals the show.

Blythe Danner is pretty good in this but Teri Polo is one horrible actress, she's so lame and wooden. I have never been a Stiller fan but his chemistry with De Niro makes this movie not so dreadful. I don't why but I saw the sequel to this film a few years ago I enjoyed that one more than this.

1281877,4,B00003CXO1,"I enjoy this film & it's follow up ""Meet the Fockers"". Certainly NOT the best film ever made-far from it. Enjoyable. I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller's. This is 1 of the 4 films I like where he is in a starring role. The other 2 ""Night at the Museum"" & ""There's Something About Mary"" HE BASICALLY PLAYED THE SAME ROLE IN ALL 3 FILMS. A nobody reacting to things going on around him & overreacting.

I actually like the follow up film more than the original. Another negative of the original: Owen Wilson Only got to see him briefly in the 2cd film.

Randy Newman's same old music-we've heard in films over the years & they all sound the same.

Good NOT GREAT extras on the DVD package.

Hard to feel for Stiller's character in either film when his character lies all the time.

The speeding to get back to Jack's (DeNiro's) house because of the Jinx? the cat lost bit. WHERE WAS THE NEEDED REACTION FROM THE OTHER CHARACTERS ABOUT GREG SPEEDING & BEING UNSAFE?",1220140800,,957,4.324022346368715

(Stiller) I won't give too much away as this is truly a hilarious film for the whole family to enjoy!

I enjoyed watching this movie. This is most definitely a keeper for any Ben Stiller fan!",1216252800,,555,4.431372549019608
1281879,5,B00003CXO1,"I am one who fully believes `Meet the Parents' to be one hysterical ride.  From start to finish they get everything right here.  The entire cast works wonderfully together and serves up some of the funniest moments in comedic film to date.  Of all the `go-to' guys in Hollywood for comedy I think that Ben Stiller is probably the most bankable.  Sure, I tend to enjoy Will Ferrell slightly more than Stiller but one can't deny that Stiller equals bank.  Everything he touches (or just about) is box-office gold.  `Meet the Parents' is no exception, but here the funniest member of the cast is not Stiller.  No, De Niro steals the thunder here delivering one of the funniest performances I've seen in recent years.

The film follows one zany weekend with the Byrnes family.  Greg is dating Pam Byrnes.  Greg wants to marry Pam but when he hears that Pam's sister Deborah is getting married and that her fianc&eacute; asked her father Jack for permission Greg feels that he must now get permission.  How hard could that be, right?  Wrong.  Jack Byrnes is a very strict and gruff man.  It's obvious that Pam is his golden child and no one will ever be good enough for her.  Pam's mother Dina is the complete opposite, in fact she seems to really like Greg, but in the eyes of Jack Greg is far from good enough for Pam.

The film them becomes a domino effect of one landed gag after another as Greg tries to prove himself worthy of Pam's hand.  Yes, each and every joke finds a home.  I was surprised myself at how funny this movie actually was.  The sequel was less successful (I loved it but it does feel like a repeat) but this original is high on the entertainment value.

Ben Stiller nails his role as the hapless Greg who just wants to be accepted and marry the girl of his dreams.  Teri Polo is kind of left on the back burner here.  She's mainly there to be the object of affection but since she isn't really given anything to do we become bored with her most of the time.  Don't let that get you down though since she never is allowed to drag down a scene.  Blythe Danner is hysterical as Dina but like I mentioned before, this movie is all about Robert De Niro.  I have always been a huge fan of De Niro but sadly his choice in film has taken a dive recently.  This film probably marks his last `great' performance.  He is on point the entire film and genuinely scene stealing hilarious.  He delivers each and every line with polish and charisma and a believable sincerity that you need to have when you're most frequent word is `Focker'.

The end of the film of course brings the family closer together after Jack tries to sabotage everything and learns his lesson.  I think that resolve is why `Meet the Fockers' fails a bit to me since it seems like a complete renig on the finale of this film.  Regardless, `Meet the Parents' should serve as Grade-A entertainment for the family and should result in quite a few belly-laughs.",1204156800,,2935,4.440074906367041

The story had every opportunity to be so much better; the nervous suitor going home to ask for his beloved's hand, especially with an actor like De Niro to intimidate him. Instead the movie relies on dumb cliches and corny lines that just aren't funny.

Making fun of, and marginalizing, the nursing profession with repeated ""jokes"" wasn't amusing, (the movie has the girl's parents repeatedly insinuate that he's a nurse because he wasn't smart enough to be a doctor) nor was the hero's bumbling.  If he's really so smart, then who do something so stupid - and cruel - as kill a family pet and then try to cover it up with a ""counterfeit""?? Not funny at all. Having the cat urinate on the beloved deceased grandmother's ashes was just gross, and that's only a few of many unentertaining gems in this feature.

Ben Stiller plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who's about to pop the question to girlfriend Pam (Polo) but before he can get it out she gets word that her sister is engaged.  What makes this a bad thing is that Greg then finds out how old fashioned Pam's father is and realizes before he can propose he needs to ask her fathers permission.  Her father Jack (De Niro) is not just an intimidating man, he's an ex-member of the CIA who is bent on exposing Greg for the sap he's certain he must be.

With Greg trying too hard to impress everyone he ends up making things much worse for himself, lying to make himself look better, losing Jack's precious cat Jinxie, flooding the backyard with sewage and quite a few other embarrassing and damaging things.  What makes this film so delightful is the chemistry between every actor here; no one seems miscast despite what you may think.

De Niro is fantastic here proving once and for all that he's one of our greatest actors, and Blythe Danner is just hilarious as Pam's mother Dina.  Great supporting performances by Owen Wilson (proving yet again that paired with Stiller they are dynamic) and James Rebhorn who's hilarious as Dr. Larry Banks.

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  Greg Focker, a male nurse, intends to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes. But before he can even ask, he goes to visit Pam's parents' house for the weekend to ask Pam's father for his daughter's hand in marriage. Little does Greg know, he will have to endure a troublesome cat, Pam's ex-boyfriend, all of Pam's relatives, and her intrusive father, Jack Byrnes, a retired CIA operative who wonders of Greg is good enough for Pam and is constantly suspicious of Greg's morals and background. Jack uses mind games, lie detector tests, and constant questions to push Greg over the edge. Greg will have to overcome Jack's interrogations and tests to finally persuade Jack to allow him to marry his daughter.",1159747200,,1317,5.731182795698925
1281923,3,B00003CXO1,"Although it has many flaws, ""Meet the Parents"" has a number of unforgettably uproarious moments, and some great dialogue between Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.  I love the ""keep your snake in its cage"" scene, the dinner scene where the urn falls over, and the interrogation scene at the airport near the end, where authorities think Greg Focker may be a terrorist.

  But with all the belly laughs it generates, ""Meet the Parents"" could still have been a much better film.  Firstly, there are just too many obnoxious and annoying characters, such as Owen Wilson, who manages to be obnoxious in almost every movie he's in, and James Rebhorn's surgeon character, who laughs at Stiller for being a nurse.  DeNiro also makes fun of Focker's profession, which tells me that Jack Byrnes may not be much brighter than Archie Bunker was twenty years ago.  Even Pam's younger brother, Denny, is irritating as he tries to pin his marijuana smoking on Stiller.  With this kind of people, anyone would loathe being around them for a weekend.

Secondly, there is very little plot at all to this movie.  It's mainly a series of gags and one-liners that seem like they could have been written originally for a sitcom.

  But the chemistry between Stiller and DeNiro is undeniable, and they both make it work.",1136419200,,1293,4.796380090497737
1281924,4,B00003CXO1,"If you are any kind of empathetic, nonsadist, then your first viewing of this movie will not be pleasant.  I found it be almost excruciating.

Everyone in this movie seems to be cruel to Greg, and his fiance incredibly callous and unsympathetic to his plight.  It seemed to drag on and rip at me.  I really did seeth at the utter mindless cruelty of these people to Greg.  It was not so fun to watch.  I think people who genuinely enjoy this movie the first time are sociopathic to some degree.

HOWEVER, i happened to find myself watching it again quite unexpectly and since I knew the final outcome, I was able to relax and not feel so much for Greg.  That is when I really began to enjoy the humor.  I'm not saying it is laugh outloud the entire time, there are some misfires, but there are some priceless moments.  The entire part where they are at Owen Wilson's house was hilarious.  And for some reason, the ridiculousness of how they treat Greg becomes funny in itself after you let go of your empathy for Greg.  It is so over the top that is is truly funny.

Plot: Greg wants to propose to his chick so he finds out he has to ask her pop, on the plane a baby spits up on him, his carryon gets lost, he knocks over the grandmothers dust, he sets the ""hoopa"" on fire, he flushes the wrong commode, he loses the cat, get accused drugs, forced to wear tiny speedo, breaks sister nose, goes through many ordeals before he gets kicked out because of the cat predicament, but later the unreasonable Dad goes and get him back and make nice with him afterall the end.",1132444800,,1566,4.303754266211604

Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Owen Wilson and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.

1281993,4,B00003CXO1,"This is another of those films where the plot basically writes itself, but depends on the absurdity of the details and the sincerity of the actors to pull it off.  Fortunately for this movie, the entire cast believes in the film and give some great performances.  Robert DeNiro banks on his tough-guy image, so that he seems to be in command even wearing a fuzzy sweater and trading belly-bucks with Owen Wilson.  Ben Stiller is sincere and likeable even when blatently lying and trying to cover his tracks.  The reason for the latter - the film does a masterful job at setting up how a little white lie keeps coming back to bite Stiller's character in the butt.

The female characters, although given less to do, ground the story in reality.  Teri Polo plays the fiancee to be, and does a subtle and vital transformation from confident professional woman to Daddy's Little Girl as she walks over the threshold of her parents' house.  But really, it's Blythe Danner as DeNiro's wife that acts as the vital brake and voice of reason on the silliness that keeps the situation barely under control until the correct moment.

There is a surprising amount of heart and truth in the story.  Most everyone has been in that dreaded situation where they are desperate to fit in but can't.  The best scene in the film is a visit to the girl's ex-fiance's house.  They all end up in the pool playing volleyball.  Stiller is obviously in good shape, but is thrown in a pool with a bunch of type-A players who obviously play pool-volleyball a lot.  As the scene plays out, you really feel his isolation and pity him, while at the same time laughing at the absurdity of the other characters.  It's this kind of heart that allows the film to have an emotional payoff at the end, which raises it out of the humdrum and into the enjoyable.

There are a number of different DVD versions of the film, varying in the number of extras.  Mainly, the deleted scenes (of which there were many) and bloopers are the reasons to get the super-special edition.",1128643200,,2032,4.587257617728532

1281995,5,B00003CXO1,"Arguably the best comedy of 2000, Meet The Parents is one of the best-written, humor-filled laughers since Caddyshack (1980). Screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke should have received Oscars for their flawless presentation of a string of ironic gaffes and hilarious antics. But Meet The Parents wouldn't be the comedy masterpiece it is without the onscreen chemistry of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Stiller, son of comedian Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld & King Of Queens), is a comic genius in his own right and has recently dominated the Hollywood box office with a string of smash spoof comedies such as There's Something About Mary (1998), Zoolander (2001), Along Came Polly (2004), and Dodgeball (2004). De Niro, on the other hand, moves from the less serious roles of his early career into the comedy genre with an ease fully indicative of his enormous talent. Earlier comic roles in Wag The Dog (1997) and Analyze This (1999) prepared movie-goers for the veteran actor's zinging one-liners. Overall, the cast is superb, and Meet The Parents excels in the realm of over-the-top humor...

Meet The Parents follows the hardship of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who travels with his fiance, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), to meet his future in-laws. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) seems alright enough, but her father, Jack (Robert De Niro), is a never-ending source of torment for the easy-going, bridge-building Greg. A retired CIA operative, Jack is paranoid and suspicious of the man who aspires to be his son-in-law, and he goes to great lengths to uncover skeletons in Greg's closet or otherwise drive a divide between his daughter and her future husband.

Along the way, Greg must not only contend with the prying eyes of Jack Byrnes, but his hellacious feline companion Jinxie, Pam's perfect ex-boyfriend Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), and the infamous Jack-mandated, Byrne family ""circle of trust"". When Greg accidentally loses Jinxie, it sets off a chain of events that is so hilarious, most people will have to watch the segment multiple times in order to catch everything. Ultimately, Jack and Greg rectify their ""circle of trust"" issues when Jack does a background check on Greg that returns little info, prompting Greg to reveal that his full name is Gaylord - yes, his name is really Gay Focker...!

Meet The Parents takes advantage of a common experience shared by its audience members and transforms this recurrent rite of passage into a truly hilarious night of entertainment. It is, quite simply, one of the funniest movies ever made. Directed by Jay Roach (director of the Austin Powers franchise), Meet The Parents is a true modern day comedy classic that, like a fine wine, only tastes better with the passage of time. It's one of those rare cinematic gems that can be watched over and over, yet still provoke shrieking laughter with relative ease. Successful enough to spawn a sequel, Meet The Fockers (which is in-and-of itself a memorable comedy), Meet The Parents is a definite must-see movie that you won't want to miss...

1281996,5,B00003CXO1,"My husband & I actually went to see this movie the week before he was going to ask my father for my hand in marriage - thank God he already knew my family, or I think this movie may have scared him off!!!

I have to say that we laughed SO hard during this movie that our cheeks hurt!  And, everyone else in the theater was laughing hysterically too.  In fact, when it was over, everyone in the theater stood up and clapped - I've only seen a standing ovation in a movie theater twice in my life!

""Meet the Parents"" is a romantic comedy about about an awkward guy who is ready to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  However, just as he's ready to pop the question, he finds out that her sister's boyfriend had just asked her father for her hand in marriage (and his girlfriend makes it clear that she thinks that this is the way it should be)- so now, he not only has to meet her parents, he has to look good enough in their eyes so that they'll say yes to his proposal.

Well, he winds up becoming even more awkward - telling lies just to look better than he his, and always in such a way that ANYONE could tell he's not on the up & up.  To boot, her father is a CIA agent, so of course he can see right through his shinanagins (did I spell that right???).  This is hysterical in & of itself, but then the physical comedy comes to play (think Jack Tripper of ""Threes Company"")...  Put together, this movie just couldn't be funnier!!!

1281998,5,B00003CXO1,"The difficulty breathing while watching this movie may be acute, so be warned before you expose yourself to it. This is perhaps Stiller's funniest movie, though definitely among his best.

Ben Stiller plays the male nurse Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam, (Teri Polo), to meet her parents. Robert DeNiro plays Jack Byrnes, an overly protective, paranoid ex-CIA agent with an obsession for his cat and the ""circle of trust"". Owen Wilson plays his usually soft-spoken, almost floppish, ex-boyfriend of Pam.

Much like in ""Meet the Fockers"", Greg's name and his profession are exploited for jokes endlessly. However, over and above this, the movie has plenty of material to keep viewers in fits and agonising spasms of laughter. Greg's attempts to win over Pam's parents are hilarious, as well as the stories he spins to try and impress. I still get a laugh out of the cat milking story and Jack's response, ""Could you milk me, Greg? I have nipples.""

Apart from the spoken humour, there is also a lot of the more visual humour, which just increases the appeal of the movie to a wider audience. Greg's antics are amazing and Stiller is amazing in this role.

I laughed so hard during this movie, and enjoyed it immensely on all occassions that I have seen it. The laughs are merciless and just keep coming at you. ""Meet the Parents"" is a movie I would keep the oxygen bottle handy, just to aid in recovery afterwards. It is an awesome movie and a classic in comedy.",1116288000,,1478,4.717054263565892

This hilarious comedy benefits from Stiller's deadpan delivery and his unfortunate weekend visit with his girlfriend's parents.  Stiller benefits from a clever, if somewhat preposterous, script, and from a supporting cast that is top notch.  Robert DeNiro as Jack Burns, ex-CIA agent, fills the bill nicely as Papa, and his interrogation of a prospective son-in-law is uproarious, especially when he conveniently talks Stiller into a polygraph test.  Blythe Danner is glorious as Mama Burns, providing a Gracie Burns type counterpoint to DeNiro's George.  Elegant and graceful, she still manages to come off with some deadpan deliveries that are sparkling.  Teri Polo is very good as Pam, Stiller's intended.  She has a smoothness and vulnerability that makes her character sympathetic.  James Rebhorn and Owen Wilson round out the cast, and director Jay Roach keeps the comedy coming.  Jinxie the cat is also great and there's an interesting extra on how the cats were trained for the movie.

In fact, ""Meet the Parents,"" although very funny, Ben Stiller seems to be typecasting himself. But really, who cares?

The greatest part of this movie actually has nothing to do with Stiller. Robert Di Nero kills as the straight man of the film. Somehow, it seems that actors you do not expect to be that funny kill when given the right jokes. And these jokes hit their audience perfectly.

The problems with this film are anticipated. The plot is predictable. Actually, the plot is pretty stupid. But the jokes save it. Thank goodness for actors who don't mind being the punch line.

I would never have seen Something about Mary with my parents. I would have cringed at the zipper scene and been mortified at the...er...hair mousse scene. But this film is parent friendly, I saw it with my mom and that was cool.

Ben Stiller plays some poor schmuck who has somehow managed to land a girlfriend far out of what should be his league, makes a complete fool out of himself time and time again trying to keep that girl, and everything magically works out in the end for no apparent reason - and there's a beloved pet in the story, too.  Hmmm, this sounds familiar.  I really don't know how I ended up watching yet another Ben Stiller movie, since Ben Stiller is one of my least favorite actors, but Meet the Parents has its funny moments, benefits greatly from the talents of the consummate actor himself, Robert De Niro, and ends up being fairly entertaining albeit redundant.

Ben Stiller plays Greg Focker, a name which leads to countless jokes throughout the film, a male nurse who has somehow won the affections of a certain Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo); his elaborate plan to propose to Pam is stymied when he learns Pam's sister is getting married in two weeks and - shudder - he is about to meet Pam's parents.  Naturally, he's nervous and tries tremendously hard to make a good impression.  Unfortunately, dear old Dad (Robert De Niro) is very hard to please and Greg, being the naturally ill-fated nincompoop he is, manages to mess up time and time again - big-time; I'm talking 100 times worse than Steve Urkel here.  I won't go into any details, so as not to take away from the hilarity that ensues - well, it's good for a few laughs, anyway.

The film actually has a great cast.  De Niro more than makes up for Stiller's faults, and Owen Wilson is a great addition as Pam's smarmy ex-fianc&eacute;.  If you like There's Something About Mary, you are sure to enjoy Meeting the Parents, as it is really just more of the same type of comedy.  The comedy actually goes a little too far, if you ask me, because there is no way that any family could accept Greg Focker after all of the damage he causes over the course of a mere weekend.

The movie is helped by the fact that most people can identify with Greg Focker and the trauma of meeting prospective in-laws for the first time, especially guys having to worry about staking a claim to daddy's little girl.  Personally, I like the fact that this movie didn't go to any gross-out extremes; barring a few common curse words and a steady supply of jokes about Greg Focker's name, this is a pretty family-friendly film.  There's nothing very original about it, but Meeting the Parents is pretty entertaining and is sure to get a few grins out of even the most curmudgeonly of viewers.",1098662400,11,2530,4.531868131868132

Everyone dates and every one has to face the parent or parents of their significant other at one time or another.  I thought this film was very good.  De niro's character is very realistic.  The movie has a lot of laughs because of the genre background of the actors.  I think Jay Roach definately knew what he was doing when he casted Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Both of these particular actors carry an opposite approach on comedy. When you put the two together you will have a hard time keeping a stright face.  Just as the actors did in the making of this genious comedy.  If you watch the extras on the dvd you will see the how hard it was for two totally different styles collaborating to bring you this type of ""de ja vu"" experience.  I highly recommend the purchase of this dvd to anyone.  It was all the round funny for the whole family.  Fathers, daughters, boyfriends, mothers, and even children can relate.  Nothing less than brilliant for strategic marketing.  As an actor myself i can say clearly that everyone in the film was casted perfectly.  The story is as simple as any really.  Greg Focker wants to marry his girlfriend and has to face her (ex cia agent) father.  He is gonna be very mysterious and pschological in determining whether Greg is right for his little girl or not.  Trust me, you'll love this film.  Of course at the climatic point Greg experiences nothing more than just a thorn in the Burn's eye's.  He must quickly think of solutions to capture their hearts and acceptance into the family.  Everything he does negatively turns around on him.  I don't want to spoil any more of the film, you will have to watch to see the turn-out of this hilarious addition to cinematic archives.",1097971200,,1793,4.5233644859813085

My favorite scene: the dinner where De Niro reads the poem about his mother that ends with the cat using her ashes for a litter box!  My favorite line: ""I have nipples, Greg, would you like to milk me?""

But about two-thirds of the way through, the movie felt like it was just Piling It On the Stiller character.  When Stiller actively deceives his future in-laws about losing their cat, I lost a lot of sympathy for him and really didn't care how it turned out.",1095897600,2,545,4.303921568627451

The potential fiance's father, however, is not exactly happy with the average man.  With this realization comes Ben Stillers hillarious attempt to simply win his respect with white lies and mistakes.

Greg Focker's first mistake is to pretend to not be a smoker to please his girl friend's dad.  He eventually has to sneak up onto the roof to have one little smoke, an event which proves disasterous.  He makes mistake after mistake, all with good intentions, but all ending up making him look like an idiot and a jerk.

Ben Stiller plays the highly energetic young Greg brilliantly, portraying, as he often does, a great guy who just loses in so many things he does.  Robert DeNiro is hillarious as the girl friend's (Pam's) father.  the father is a kind man with the best of intentions and motives, but wants to hold on to his daughter forever.

He has plenty of support in this one with one of the greatest to ever grace the screen in Robert De Niro. Owen Wilson also gives a memorable performance.

Gaylord Faucher aka Greg(Stiller) is a male nurse and he loves the Pam Byrnes(Polo) the woman he is dating. He has plans to marry her, but after a phone call from Pam's sister to her telling her about her engagement. Pam tells Greg how happy her dad is about her sister fiance asking him about marrying his daughter. With that in mind Greg decides he will to when they go to visit her family this weekend.

Jack Byrnes(De Niro) is a straight edge man. He's ex-CIA and likes things his way and very organized. He quicklky takes a dislike to Greg, and Greg doesn't help his case with accident after accident. Jack has it out for Greg and the more Greg tries the deeper he gets in the hole he's digging. He also gets to meet Pam's old fiance Kevin(Wilson) who Jack now absolutely loves.

He's deep enough in the hole tha his relationship is in trouble with Pam. Jack keeps laying it on and Greg must prove himself to Jack that he loves his daughter and that they do belong together.

The movie really works. The cast is absolutly great. You can see the onscreen chemistry between everybody. Stiller doesn't have to carry the movie so it doesn't collapse. De Niro really shines in the role and he's funny while ruthal all at the same time. You really sympahtize with Greg because he tries so hard. Stiller plays a loser well and he's funny while amusing in this role.

The DVD extras are decent. There are some commentaries and other things. They aren't to exciting, but I wasn't that disappointed with them.

If you love Robert De Niro or Ben Stiller you have to buy this movie. This is probaly Stillers best movie in his carear. De Niro is the man and you won't be disappointed by him.

This isn't one of them.
In fact, this is the best movie I've seen him in by a good margin.  Owing much to brilliant support from DeNiro (who plays the Father in Law to be), as well as Owen Wilson (his fiance's ex-boyfriend).
Just thinking about the scene where Stiller (who plays a Jewish city dweller) is charged with saying grace at DeNiro's devoutely Christian table, the popping of the Champagne, Jinxy running away...brings a laugh everytime.
If you're one of the few who haven't seen this film, get it, odds are you'll enjoy immensely.  If, like me, you've seen it before and are curios about buying it, I recommend you do.  This is one of the few DVD's in my collection that I frequently watch and enjoy.

1282130,3,B00003CXO1,"Meet The Parents is an amusing slapstick comedy that describes the struggles of meeting one's potential in-laws.  Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller both give commanding performances.  Also Blythe Danner is noteworthy in her role as Jack's wife.
As good as the acting is, the script suffers from excessive overkill.  The scene where the champagne cork pops and tips over the urn containing Jack's mothers remains is way too ridiculous.  The scene where Greg is on the roof pursuing Trixie is also too off the wall for my tastes. After that point its a wonder that Greg and Jack are even talking.
Don't get me wrong, there are some funny remarks and moments.  I even appreciate the cheap humor on  Greg Focker's last name.  However, Meet The Parents beats the same theme to death midway thru the movie that whereas the humor has some moments, the headaches depicting Greg Focker's trials and tribulations emerge as well.",1084060800,,915,4.826923076923077
1282131,5,B00003CXO1,"""Meet the Parents"" is a surprisingly funny film bolstered into the top ranks of modern comedies by the two standout performances of Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  There's never a dull moment in this laugh-a-minute comedy from director Jay Roach of the ""Austin Power's"" franchise and screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, who also wrote and starred in the 1992 short film of the same name.
Gaylord `Greg' Focker (just you try and say that last name without smiling), played to the max by the comic talents of Stiller, is head-over-heels in love with his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo).  After a failed attempt at proposing marriage, Greg learns that if he intends to marry Pam, it is important to first OK the proposition with her father, Jack (De Niro).  Pam's sister's wedding seems a perfect time to talk with Jack, so he accompanies Pam back to her parent's house.  What ensues is a fantastically funny film, basically about the trouble and misunderstandings Greg endures for his love for Pam.
The awkward dynamics between De Niro and Stiller's characters make for the most side-splitting moments of the film.  Upon having first viewed this movie several years ago, I can still clearly remember Greg's notions of milking cats, Jack's ""poetry reading"", the urn, the polygraph, Greg's prayer, the Speedo, Focker...  Those who have already seen ""Meet the Parents"", (and who hasn't?) are probably fondly reminiscing upon these positively hysterical scenes right now.
""Meet the Parents"" certainly isn't cinematic art, folks.  The screenplay is predictable, at best.  And maybe some of the jokes didn't strike a chord with every audience member.  However, this film greatly succeeds at what it is; a comedy.  I will most certainly be first in line to see ""Meet the Fockers"", slated for release in December of 2004.",1083283200,,1821,5.019933554817276

 Stiller is Greg Fokker, who just wants to marry his girlfriend Pam. I really don't want to spoil it for anybody, but the two end up going to Pam's parents because her sister is getting married. Greg sees this as an opportunity to meet her parents and gain their approval of his proposal to Pam. The interaction between Greg and Pam's father, played by one of the greatest actors ever--Robert DeNiro, is just hilarious also. From the start he doesn't like Greg. And just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong, and Greg is always to blame. These are the kind of things you think could happen to you in real life, only here everything really does go wrong. I could write about some of the funniest parts of this,like when Pam's brother discovers a statue in Greg's jacket, or when Greg(Jewish) is nominated to say grace before dinner, but I think that it is best to watch this yourself. If you have never seen it you may be surprised. But like I said, you owe it to yourself to see this great movie. Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller are great in their roles in this movie. And for those who have seen it, the sequel Meet the Fokkers is in the works and I believe it will be released later in 2004, so see this one soon.

In the living room is the girl. Mother mentions dad will be right in, and positions you in a sofa, as far away from the girl as possible, leaving the seat right next to you.
In walks 300 pounds of Dad, who sits down, eyes you from top to bottom, then locks his eyes on yours, and starts a monologue about his daughter being in pristine condition, and him demanding she'd be returned in that very condition, too. He continues about how you are to take things easy.
With sweat trinkling down your back, you finally leave with the girl who immediatly makes a comment about over-protective parents followed by a giggle.
While I wish this was made up? It is not.
When I first learned about 'Meet the Parents', I figured it would be worth a laugh. In the cinema, though? I was experiencing that scene over and over in my head. Except, 300 pounds of dad looked remarkably like Robert De Niro, while my character was being played by Ben Stiller.
I found out though, that I had experienced the mild version.
Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Stiller. (what's in a name?)) has steadily been dating Pam Byrnes for a while, and is about to propose to her. Until he finds out her sister is getting married. When he overhears Pam making a comment that Bob (her sister's fiancee) was very smart to seek out Pam's dad's (De Niro) approval first, he decides against asking her right then and there.
Greg and Pam head over to her parents' place for the wedding of her sister, with Greg intended on getting on Dad's good side, to see if he can get his blessing. But that's when the trouble starts.
Greg's luggage is lost, and a series of misinterpreted comments, little lies by Greg in order to stay on Dad's good side, and some honest mistakes lead to growing tension between Greg and Dad. When Greg finds out that Dad is, in fact, NOT a florist as he was told, but a retired CIA spy interrogator, things start getting REAL ugly.
Though Stiller probably was typecast based on his performance in '""here's something about Mary"", his performance doesn't give you a feeling of deja vu. Stiller is exceptional at playing the poor misunderstood, but most of all pity-inflicting guy; someone you can't help but feel sorry for, and yet at the same time laugh so hard about.
Drama after drama piles up, and from a rather confident man, the viewer sees Stiller transform into a paranoid and broken man, who is trying SO hard to get on Dad's good side, but unintentionally manages to create situation after situation leading to dad noticably liking him less and less.
De Niro is a wonderful 'bad' guy. From the very first moment we meet him, he convinces as the over-protective father, who is a tad skeptical towards Greg, turning more and more suspicious of him as the movie goes along. One can't really blame him. All evidence suggests against Greg, and he's just looking out for his favourite daughter.
All in all, the movie is highly entertaining. Nothing is funnier than laughing other people's misery (Proof? America's funniest homevideos. The harder they fall? The harder we laugh), and this movie exploits that fully well. You can't help NOT laughing, while at the very same time you feel so terribly sorry for Stiller.
For those interested? I did return the girl in pristine condition, and broke up with her shortly after. One of the reasons was her parents being overly suspicious, and spying on us whenever we had some privat time. De Niro handles that part a bit better and uses micro-cameras.",1063843200,2,3612,4.5928792569659445

They travel together to her WASP family's home (Blythe Danner is the Mom, thus the Wasp overtones) in Long Island for her sister's wedding. De Niro plays the father of the family, a retired ""flower importer"" (he actually is something else, but  I won't ruin the surprise), who delights in poking small and large fun at his bumbling prospective son-in-law.
The movie follows Stiller and the family throughout the weekend and the very funny happenings and mishaps. Owen Wilson steals the movie as the former boyfriend.
I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy broad comedies. If you want to see a different side to De Niro, this movie offers it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to those who need subtlety and nuance in their comedies-you won't get it here.
I enjoyed the voice over commentary on the DVD (De Niro, Stiller, the director, and one other production person).

Now he's got to do the same, which means he's got to meet the parents. And with the plot set, the laughter ensues...

Stiller is real and yet hysterical, and Robert de Niro's squinty-eyed future dad causes me to appreciate my own father-in-law. Owen Wilson's cameo as the former boyfriend is one of the high points of the movie. The best bit, though, is the wittily written dialogue which will remain a permanent part of your conversation. Long after you've wiped the tears of hilarity away, you will find yourself blurting out in public for no discernable reason, ""I have nipples. Can you milk me?""",1039996800,,626,4.915094339622642
1282262,2,B00003CXO1,"I had heard this movie was funny, wonderful, etc but really, it is really a poor film.  If you like Robert De Niro before, you won't like him in this as he is totally miscast.  The humour in the film is average, and while there are some funny parts it is too over the top predictable crap.  We turned it off in the last five minutes because it was just too far fetched. Granted, the movie started out ok and the storyline was promising, but within forty minutes it slowly died.  Why does Hollywood keep making these crappy films.  Moreover, why do big names like De Niro and Stiller do them - don't they read the scripts first?",1038355200,3,627,4.279661016949152

I loved this screwball element, the neverending onslaught of difficulty and misunderstanding. But all of the sexual and homosexual double entendres really distracted me from the humor, because I don't find such shallow jokes and things funny at all.

I would like to watch Meet the Parents again for the intriguing plot, but I would find it difficult because all of the less than funny things really take away from the experience.",1037404800,2,556,4.978494623655914
1282324,4,B00003CXO1,"The plot?  Ben Stiller is a nurse, very much in love with Teri Polo. Just as he is about to propose, he comes to know about Teris sisters engagement to some doctor  guy who was courteous enough to ask Teris father before asking her sister! Obviously Ben wants to be in the good books of Teri. As a result, he decides to spend the weekend with Teris parents. Of course, he screws up the weekend, with the aid of my man  Robert De Nero, who is Teris father (surprise!) and is, in not in a mood to have a nurse as his son  in  law. A slew of idiosyncrasies exhibited by Ben soon follow, till the movie ends. The end? (Take a guess.)
The movie is a war between a nurse (Ben) and an ex  C.I.A. interrogator (De Nero)  the former trying to win the heart of the latter, and the latter finding it hard to accept the former because of a lot of things, such as the formers name, profession, hatred towards cats, and a whole lot of other goofy things, which make up the movie.
Ben can be looked upon with pity, considering the things he has to go through, throughout the weekend, but the movie is, by no means, a warm hearted  comedy. So, laugh your heart out on Ben, as he makes a total [donkey] of himself (very seriously), with no sense of pathos. The humor is not merely slapstick and is, in a lot of parts, very subtle. Apart from Ben, falling off the roof of the house, making a fruitless attempt to catch De Neros pet cat and almost setting the house on fire and making a healthy contribution to overflowing the septic tank (and blaming the cat for doing it, on top of that) the funny bits are well contained within formal conversation between Di Nero & Ben, with a stoic expression on the faces of both which makes the comedy more mordant and funny. The exchange of words between Ben & Robert which appear seething on the surface, is what gives a high to the movie.  Even as Ben breaks up before the flight attendant, towards the end of the movie, while returning home after a terrible weekend, makes us laugh rather than feel sorry for him.
The end is as sweet as it can get, with things, somehow patched up between Di Nero and Ben, of course. All is well that ends well.",1035590400,,2169,4.245145631067961
1282325,3,B00003CXO1,"I've seen this movie a few times, and I still think it's funny... but I don't consider it to be ""one of the best ever"", as some have perceived it.
A lot of what happens to Greg is identifiable by the average fiancee, which is what makes it funny, but some of it is so extravagant it's unbelievable, which I think detracts from the story a bit.  That, and the number of things which happen to him -- he hits Pam's sister in the nose with a volleyball, he sets their wedding gazebo on fire, he loses Jinx (the cat), tries to replace Jinx with a look-alike, he backs-up the septic system creating quite a mess in the backyard, et al.  It almost buckles under its own weight.
Yet, despite these things, it's still funny.  I think what keeps it afloat is the acting.  Stiller is perfectly set as the hapless fall-guy Focker.  DeNiro does very well playing the suspicious father / former CIA detective.  Wilson does pretty well as the ""perfect"" ex-boyfriend, although they probably could've gotten someone even better.  And Polo is well set as the beautiful girlfriend.  And they have a great upper-middle-class setting as well.
Avid Ben Stiller fans will probably be all over this movie.  I'm happy enough to see it on cable occasionally, but not to own it.  (Lastly, I'd actually like to put in a rating of 3.5 stars.)",1035590400,2,1314,4.529661016949152

You could count on this movie to have a good time with. Alot of people have overlooked this movie is I don't think is a good thing to do. Why do they do such a thing? Because some people just start to judge a movie by it's commercial's and trailers which is not a good thing to do because the movie could be entirly different to what the trailers and commerical's show you. This movie is one of those movie's which shows you that judging a movie by it's commerical is not the correct thing to do.
Greg Focker plays Greg...Focker who is a male nurse and is living with his girlfriend Pam played by Teri Polo. Greg wants to propose to Pam untill she gets a call from her sister saying that she is getting married in two weeks and Greg overhears her saying that it was the right thing to ask her father first. Greg then decides to ask Pam's father if he could marry her when they visit them in two weeks for the wedding. Of course that is not going to be easy. The trouble starts for Greg right at the airport after he gets spit up on by a baby and the airport loses his luggage. It all goes downhill from there because of Jack Burns who is played by Robert De Niro is Pam's father who immediately takes a disliking to Greg just because nobody is ever good for his daughter even her ex-finacee who Jack started to like after she and him broke up. When Greg learns that Pam's father was an ex CIA man he becomes extremly nervous because he knows that Jack will be watching him and then the rest of the family arrives. Will Greg ever be able to marry Pam?
Meet the Parents makes you laugh till you...well stop! It's one of those movies where you do have to like the topic of just an insane goofball comendy much with the same type of humer as the Austin Powers seris of with the same director.

I had heard ""Meet the Parents"" was very hilarious but somehow I couldn't seem to enjoy the film that much. Here are the good and bad points of the film and why I give ""Meet the Parents"" three stars.
First the acting done by Robert De Niro must be mentioned (check out his reading of the poem he wrote for his deceased mother :). He's the perfect ex-CIA agent you would imagine in your head. His part in the film should make the title change to ""Meet My Father"" or something like that. Ben Stiller is also impressive as the character of Greg Focker. The beginning and the end of the movie I was surprised how much emotion he portrayed and could see his love for Pam. But during the middle of the film, I was a bit discouraged from liking his character. Oh, and since this is a Ben Stiller movie, you probably already know that Owen Wilson gets a small role as Kevin Rawley, Pam's ex-fiance. I wish we could have seen more of him, his comedic talent and sarcastic wit wasn't really put to work.
The story just didn't seem to impress me. The beginning as I said seemed to go well but as the story went along, it went in my opinion downhill. I just couldn't buy how much trouble the character of Greg Focker could get into. In fact, this movie very much reminds me of Steve Martin's ""Father of the Bride"", which I think I loved more.
The movie is definitely rated PG-13 for sexual content and humor. ""Meet the Parents"" had it's very funny moments but some of the jokes just weren't funny.
So, maybe it's just me but this movie just didn't seem to click with me. But of course, everyone has their own tastes so I suggest you try it out once, maybe rent it at the video rental store.",1027036800,3,2320,4.263038548752834

It revolves around the theme of having to please a significant other's parents in order to gain approval. If you know someone who has had bad luck with parents, then this is for you.

1282444,5,B00003CXO1,"""Meet Parents"" follows the comical misadventures of Ben Stiller's most horrible weekend as his character Greg travels with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to her parents' home to meet them and pop the big question.  As you would imagine, this being a romantic comedy, everything that could go wrong DOES, only 10X worse!!!
THE STORY:
Greg wants to marry Pam and is ready to ask her the big one but fate intervenes and Greg realizes to make the best impression he'll first need to meet Pam's parents and get her father's permission first.  Pam and Greg travel home for her sister's wedding and Greg tries his VERY best to make a good impression on Pam's dad Jack (the legendary Robert DeNiro!!!).  Things immediately go from bad to worse as it is revealed that Jack is actually a former CIA operative and Greg continually digs himself into a TON of bad spots that would surely make you think he'll NEVER make it into the family - and that's too bad because he's an overall pretty nice guy!!!
THE COOL THINGS:
This movie's actually the PERFECT comedy of errors and Greg's life just continually goes from bad to worse.  The amazingly horrible situations he gets into are hilarious and at the same time really pathetic.  You'll definitely feel for his character.
The performances turned in by the two male leads, Stiller and DeNiro are just amazing.  They complement each other perfectly and bring the characters to life amazingly well.
BEST SCENES:
1. The Polygraph Test
2. The Car Race
3. Septic Trouble
4. Jack's Mom
5. The Pool Party
6. The Fire Scene
7. The Airport
8. The Name Jokes
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES

1282446,4,B00003CXO1,"I have not been this surprised by a mainstream hit in a long time.
Ben Stiller is Greg Focker, who goes home with his live-in girlfriend, Teri Polo, to meet her parents and attend her sister's wedding. He decides to ask her father for permission to marry her. Soon, Greg realizes his could be father in law ain't right. He is a former CIA operative who may still be in the company, and everything Greg does is wrong, wrong, wrong. He also meets his girlfriend's ex-fiancee, played very well by Owen Wilson, who is the success everyone expects Greg to be.
I think this film works, especially to anyone who has, is, or plans to be married, or even in a long term relationship. Ben Stiller is hilarious as Greg Focker, being sympathetic without being weak. I read Jim Carrey almost took this role, and I think he would have been all wrong for it. Robert DeNiro shows he can do comedy as well as drama, being menacing and funny at the same time. Blythe Danner, as DeNiro's wife, kind of fades into the furniture whenever DeNiro and Stiller get a chance to play off each other.
The script is very funny without going over the top with a bunch of gross out gags. All the comedy unfolds and makes sense to the story, not like the Farrelly brothers, who seem to make up the disgusting stuff first, then fashion a screenplay around it. Although it veers into Chris Columbus/ John Hughes/ warm and fuzzy territory once in a while, it holds together well.
Jay Roach has a great eye for suburban comedy, taking a nice upper middle class family and introducing regular middle class Stiller. The film is edited together well, and the gags work almost all of the time.
Like I wrote, I was surprised to like such a big hit. When I find out a film like this goes over a hundred million, I figure the marketing campaign was successful. It is nice to see a film that deserves its audience. I highly recommend ""Meet the Parents.""

1282509,3,B00003CXO1,"There are funny moments in Meet the Parents. Owen Wilson, who perhaps has the best performance of the lot, plays the perfect ex-fiance to Ben Stiller's love interest. The only thing he hasn't done is cure the world of all known diseases--but I'm sure he's working on it. There is one scene where he mentions, as an aside, that he carved this ornate altar out of a single block of wood. The delivery of that line is perfect.
The movie's flaws are several fold. First, it has trouble landing on being funny or just plain creepy. Part of the problem is Robert DeNiro. A terrific actor, he just doesn't pull off his role. His character just creepy, angry, and offensive, but only marginally humorous. For a movie that shoots for laughs, that's a big problem. In addition, it is almost impossible to like Ben Stiller's character. He is a nicotine addicted, shallow, and deceitful creep. You end up hoping that DeNiro finds some way to end his pitiful existence. Without a main character you can root for, this movie lacks a central core to pull of its ""decent guy finds himself in a nuthouse"" premise.
The ending where Stiller and his fiance get back together is, perhaps, is the worst part. It is cliche and not at all credible.  I must, however, separate this from the last moments of the film where Stiller goes into a diatribe without knowing he is being filmed.  That may be the best moment in the film.
I gave this movie three stars, rather than just two, because I didn't regret watching it--it had its moments--and I had to leave room for the dregs like Stargate and Independence day at the bottom pegs of the scale.

This is a movie that I have seen many, many times and I know that I will be watching this wonderful film for many years to come. The plot is hysterical, the characters and the actors that took on the roles are great, and the humor is laugh-out-loud funny.
 The plot, while very simple, is one of the funniest plots that I have seen in years. Greg (Gaylord) Focker, who is played by Ben Stiller, falls in love with the woman of his dreams and it's time to meet her parents. The mother of his girlfriend is easygoing but the father, played by Al Pacino, is very hard to get along with and is not overly fond of Greg. Greg gets into every screwup imaginable throughout this film and everybody seems to be turning against him.
 The actors are great. First of all, you have two acting greats in this film. Ben Stiller and Al Pacino are very well known actors and a third actor, while not known as much of Al and Ben, is Owen Wilson. Plus a cast of other actors that will have you rolling your eyes and just laughing non-stop will make you enjoy the movie the whole time it's playing.
 Now that you are informed about this great movie what are you waiting for? Order this DVD and be sure to enjoy it. This film is brilliant due to many reasons.

1282514,4,B00003CXO1,"Meet the Parents is, for me, happy confirmation that Hollywood can still make a terrific comedy that has broad appeal. I wish this would happen more often. Today much of the focus is on audiences between twelve and twenty-five years old. There is no denying that this is the age group that goes to the movies the most, and catering to it is appropriate. Still, the huge hits are almost always ones like Titanic and The Sixth Sense whose appeal is to a much broader age range. This is why Meet the Parents has been so successful. There are things in it a twelve-year old can enjoy, but it is equally entertaining to someone who is sixty.
Greg [Ben Stiller] is a highly competent nurse who is head-over-heels in love with Pam Burnes [Teri Polo], a school teacher. He sets up an elaborate marriage proposal for her, but in the middle of it, she not only announces that her sister is engaged, but also exclaims that she is thrilled that her sibling's fiance asked her father's permission first. Greg, who is as insecure as they come, decides not to propose just yet. He will please Pam and her family by waiting to talk to dear old Dad. The opportunity comes when the couple goes from Chicago to New York to attend the sister's wedding.
Have you ever been in a situation where nothing you do or say works? That's what Greg encounters when he finally meets the parents. Mother Dina [Blythe Danner] is amiable enough, but father Jack [Robert DeNiro] is, to say the least, a challenge. It isn't that he is heartless or mean. It's that he is ferociously protective of his family, especially of his favorite, Pam. You know the type. No man has ever been good enough for his little Pammy. Making Jack even more formidable is his former profession. He's a retired CIA agent. Ferreting out the truth was his job. The house if full of spy cams, and Jack even owns his own polygraph machine. He just can't let go of these toys or of the spy mentality Then there is the family cat. It's a gorgeous Himalayan that is Jack's favorite pet of all time. Jack says it can never go out side because it has no survival skills. This is a comedy, and, of course, someone lets the cat out. You can guess who manages to do that. And in this comedy of disasters, this is only a small part of Greg's problems.
Robert DeNiro, who has shown himself to be a natural in comedies lately, and Ben Stiller, always good for a lot of laughs, play off each other as if they have been a comedy team for years. Blythe Danner is amusing as Mom, and Teri Polo is appropriately sweet and lovable as Pam. Almost stealing the movie is Owen Wilson as Kevin, as Pam's flamboyant, millionaire ex-fiance. Director Jay Roach originally envisioned Kevin as a jock type, but Wilson put his own spin on the character, as he always does. The results are hysterically funny. Near the end of the movie, watch for Kali Rocha, whose interpretation of an airline employee from hell should have you rolling on the floor with laughter.
Meet the Parents is an example of a hit that almost wasn't. There were constant rewrites throughout the shoot. DeNiro and Danner were brought back to reshoot the ending, as was Polo to add a new opening. This movie is an example of how persistence can pay off, and, in this case, pay off big time.",1016323200,,3271,4.471571906354515
1282515,2,B00003CXO1,"This could have and should have been a much better movie.  The premise is that Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, is to meet his potential fiance's parents for the first time.  The father, Jack Byrnes played by Robert DeNiro, is overly suspicious and overly protective of his daughter, not to mention, his cat.  Greg senses this right away and tries throughout most of the rest of the movie to impress his potential future father in law.  Of course, everything Greg does and says does exactly the opposite so by the end of the film, Jack is convinced that Greg is conniving and dishonest and completely unsuitable for his daughter.
We, the audience are supposed to feel bad for Greg because he is supposedly, a good hearted person.  The problem is, he isn't and he really deserves to be excommunicated from this family.  The script should have had the various ""accidents"" that happen in the movie be just that, accidents so we would sympathize with Greg's plight.  Instead, at least most of these accidents occurred because Greg actually is dishonest and a person of low moral character.  For example, he spray paints the tail of a cat found in a shelter to pass him off as Jack's real cat.  Why are we supposed to believe that a person who would do this is a good guy simply because he is only doing it because he feels pressured by Jack?  I don't buy it.  Especially when he wasn't up front about losing the original cat in the first place which happened because he wanted to smoke a cigarette even though he told Jack and his wife he doesn't smoke.  See what I mean?  He weaves a huge web of deceit, yet at the end, all is forgiven.
There are some fairly humerous parts in this movie but I really couldn't enjoy it because I just could not get myself to like the main character.",1015545600,4,1782,4.479876160990712
1282516,5,B00003CXO1,"MEET THE PARENTS may not be the best comedy of 2000, but it comes pretty close. Granted that many of the laughs can be seen setting up a mile before they arrive. Still, that doesn't make them any less funny. Ben Stiller is a great comic actor and has the poor schmuck routine down perfectly. However, Stiller doesn't steal the show here. He shares center stage with Robert DeNiro. DeNiro isn't known for his comic abilities, but if he can make a few more great comedies like this, he may become known as a great comic genius.
Other than a few swear words and a little sexual innuendo, the movie remains closer to a PG family flick of the PG-13 rating, rather than the more racier, near R-rating side of the 13. It's a film that families with children older than 10 can enjoy together. The movie reminded me of and is closer in style to older comedies that stars such as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, and Dick Van Dyke used to make; rather than the typical gross-out picture fests that is so typical nowadays.
The movie succeeds because it's premise is derived from the very real fears of life. What groom to be doesn't fear meeting his father-in law for the first time? Then when finally meeting him find out that the man not only doesn't like you, but is an ex-CIA agent who is watching every move you make with secretly placed video cameras and is so stubborn that he can't see beyond his own selfish pride how much his daughter is in love. It's the worst fear of every man who's every asked for his father-in-law's blessing. And it just happens to make for a wonderful comedy.",1015113600,3,1576,4.437931034482759

When I see Ben Stiller sell himself short in such a cliched, self-hating-jew stereotype, it makes me cringe, but that's not the real reason I disliked the movie (and the entire genre it represents so well).
When someone in an awkward situation lies to try to make it better, then lies to cover up the lie, then continues in greater and greater contortions to try to preserve their illusion of social conformity, it's presented as funny.  But to me, it isn't.  It's a tragedy, and it's a tragedy reflected in our daily lives as a society.
 This movie reminds me of everything I dislike about shallow social convention, and about people who subscribe to it and who desperately crave the approval of others. No laugh track, no acrobatically awkward pratfall, could make me find that funny.",1013212800,6,947,4.652694610778443
1282587,2,B00003CXO1,"The plot of the film is reasonably simple. Ben Stiller plays a character who is a male nurse. He feels a little edgey about his social status and has a difficult time when he meets the parents of his fiance. He tries to be pleasant but his attempts to be polite are seen as evasion or lying. He limps along from disaster to disaster seeming more and more absurd till a rather artificial happy ending.
Ben Stiller now must be close to Americas premier comic actor. Robert De Nero is not normally known for his comic strengths but his skills as an actor means that he is good in his part. Terri Polo as Stiller's girlfriend is also good, looking attractive but not like a model, like  a real person.
The basic problem with the film is that it is not very funny. A few of the scences are very good, but the pace of the film is slow and most of the jokes are drawn out and the plot density is not very dense. In most succesful comedies there are usually a number of plot turns occuring at any one time so that jokes are unexpected and pile on top of each other. In this film the set up scenes crank along slowly so that you can see each joke coming a mile off and they have limited impact.
The other problem is that the Stiller character is not that likeable. The fact that his fiance wants him at the end is not that rational and one thinks that she must have slept through a lot of the previous action. Still its sort of okay.",1012608000,,1424,4.159420289855072

DeNiro does an adequate job (he was much better in ""Midnight Run"" - if you can stand the repetition of the f-word and the body count, watch it; it's a very funny road movie/buddy pic).
Stiller was much better in ""There's Something About Mary"" (that movie was just much better all around).
Owen Wilson is very good.
A few very funny scenes; but too many where there is too much effort to be funny and the humor never really hits the mark.  Stiller, however, does a great job setting the mood in the beginning and getting the audience to squirm and feel his pain, er, discomfort.",1012262400,2,613,4.5225225225225225
1282589,4,B00003CXO1,"Watching a comedy is always a dangerous thing.  The majority are gross-out, Farrelly brothers-inspired and frankly very patchy.  This is a treat as it's not only funny but it's also completely inoffensive.  In it nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) goes with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to ask her father's (Robert deNiro) to marry her.  Before long Greg is under the scrutiny of the whole family, Pam's old fianc&eacute; and even the family cat.
Yes, admittedly it's obvious and has been done before.  However, there are several things about 'Meet The Parents' which makes it stand out from the crowd.  For one, it has a fantastic cast.  Robert deNiro takes an utterly different course for a change and pulls it off as the CIA agent/protective father.  Ben Stiller also proves that his mixture of affable nature and sarcasm can more than carry a movie.
Secondly, there's just so many great set-ups here that will make you laugh throughout the entire movie.  Although there are few laugh-out-loud moments, it's so consistent that you have to admire it.  It's a case of what's the worst that could happen and it's sweet natured without being cutesy.  This is a perfect all-rounder, something for the whole family.",1011744000,2,1211,4.916256157635468

Greg is absolutely the perfect houseguest...polite, well mannered...trying everything in his power to absorb the insanity around him. To no avail we see as one mis-step leads to the worst case scenario everytime...I give this a ten. Whether Ben, as Greg, is contemplating the bathing suit or telling the ""cat milking"" story he gets my vote for the next James Bond.

Robert De Niro is absolutely perfect in the role of the father, who is an ex-agent and is absolutely a nightmare future father-in-law.

In his eagerness to make a good impression and gain acceptance he suffers through incredible humiliations and misadventures.  I love the song ""Fool for Love"".

You're right when you say that it lacks typical comedy of the falling down the stairs, oh-my-God he hurt his head sort.  In Meet the Parents, the humor is a bit different.  It's in the way Greg Fokker holds his hands up, clasped in prayer, just a bit too high.  It's in the way he manages to commit every possible faux pas, and then some.  It's how when they're playing volleyball, the moment he starts to try hard, he breaks the girl's nose.

1282630,4,B00003CXO1,"Though hardly a 'high-concept' film, this is based around one central idea - a guy goes to meet his girlfriend's parents and everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. I honestly wondered how long they could keep the idea going without it running out of steam or without degenerating into cheezey incredulity. I needn't have feared: the movie sustains itself, even with the simplest of plots, remarkably well. As things go from bad to worse for male nurse, Ben Stiller, a great script and excellent performances from the two lead actors (Stiller and De Niro), ensure that even when events approach high farce, it never becomes forced, and the ridiculous happenings never overstep the mark into lameness.
The humour is not merely physical, though when the comedy does rely on slapstick, it is brilliantly executed. The ongoing joke about the cat, the toilet and the opposeable thumbs (you may have to watch it to understand that) is just one example of the sharp, witty flavour of the dialogue.

It starts with a jinx-happy average joe (Ben Stiller) named Greg Fawker who wants to marry a school teacher (Jay Roach). Before she does, though, she has to make sure it's alright with her parents. It passes with her mom, but her dad (Robert De Niro), a paranoid ex-CIA agent, gets a little...too paranoid.
Sounds like funny comedy, right? No, the trailers/TV commercials have truly deceived you there, it's the direct oppisite.
OK, it's starts off alright, but the middle turns it more serious and even cornier jokes I had to plow through infest this waste of great actors.
I'm starting to sound obnioxious, right? I'm sorry about that, but I just can't stand unfunny comedies. And neither do you. So we are anti-unfunny-humor pals, right? Then trust me on this one.
To the jokes:
Flat, and preditible. There's even one that rips-off a joke similar to that from ""Dumb and Dumber"": something valueble is knocked over by a cork and what comes in return are disasterous results. In ""Dumb and Dumber"", a guy accidentley knocks over and kills a snowy owl with a cork, in here (""Meet the Parents"", though why do I have to add this part?) Greg knocks over De Niro's mother's ashes with a cork (but what's also pretty predictible and just put in to put some originality to the punchline) the family cat urinates on the ashes.
The acting is plain old grosteque and wooden, even worst than the horrible writing and flat jokes combined (""You can't say bomb on an airplane!"" ""Bomb, bomb, bomb!"").
If you wanna laugh at 2000 comedy material, stick to the trailers of this film (which are strikingly more funny than the film itself), ""Chicken Run"", or (the unintentionally amusing sci-fi/action/thriller) ""Battlefield Earth"".

1282632,2,B00003CXO1,"Comedies are probably the hardest films to write, because having a good idea is one thing - having a good wit is another. You can create an action film or horror film quite easily as long as its relatively original, but with comedy you need to be much smarter. About the only thing you can get away with is a bit of cliche with the storyline.
This film is certainly very chilched. You only need take a look at the video box to know what it's about. Surely half the point of pretty much ANY type of film is that there are elements that you don't expect. A guy meet his fianc's parents and the Dad is very strict and inevitably he messes things up yet it all ends happily. How cute. If I have ruined the film for you, then your powers of logic really are rusty coz I figured it out without even seeing the film.
Now all would be OK if the film was actually funny. After all, a joke is a joke. Simply put, its not. The amount of times I was tempted to leave the room and not bother watching it to the end were off the scale. I cannot remember a single joke or incident worth repeating. It's just one of those cringably unfunny films that makes you feel sorry for the actors involved. If you think I'm just being a bloke, I'm not.

1282707,4,B00003CXO1,"For anyone who's been faced with the unique experience of having to ask the parents of your intended for her hand in marriage (as I did, dear reader), you'll know the essential conflict of poor Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), the central character of ""Meet the Parents.""
Do you just overcome your nervousness (which is substantial, let me tell you) and be yourself, or do you make yourself out to be Bill Gates with a sensitive side?
For Greg, a nice guy who's just a little too insecure to be himself around his intended fiancee's parents, the answer is to weave a tapestry of bull (including the proclamation that you can milk a cat). Of course, it's well-intentioned bull, but it's bull nonetheless, and his father-in-law to be (Robert DeNiro) sees right through it.
Of course, it's easier to be yourself when your future dad-in-law isn't an ex-CIA operative who hooks you up to a lie detector and asks if you've ever watched a porn flick (the needle flickers intently...). It's also a lot easier to win your new father-in-law's affection when the guy doesn't idolize your fiancee's last boyfriend, a self-made yuppie, born-again Christian, and highly skilled woodworker.
All Greg has to sell is that he's a Jewish kid from a farm where they milked cats, and he's a male nurse to boot.
And, of course, not every poor guy who goes to meet his future in-laws ends up flooding their lawn with septic waste, setting their back yard on fire, ruining a wedding, losing the family cat, and having someone else's suitcase - complete with bondage gear - delivered to the family home.
The nice thing about ""Meet the Parents,"" though, is that all these abuses heaped on Greg are never anything but good-natured; if this film's tone had veered even slightly towards cruelty, it simply wouldn't have worked.
Stiller does a great job keeping Greg as a likeable BS artist, not a con artist, and De Niro is terrific as usual as every guy's nightmare father in law. The writing is sharp, and the filmmakers are smart enough to know that the conflict will never go beyond being a good-natured series of misadventures and misunderstandings.
We know Greg is a nice guy who deserves the girl, and her family's respect, but it's just a matter of enduring his pain until his luck turns and his new family begins to accept him.

The story has been told countless times: a all-around nice guy desperately attempts to capture the approval of his fiancee's gruff father.

This leads to several hit-or-miss set pieces that mostly hit, a rarity in Hollywood these days.  A lot of the credit has to go towards the film's stars, although the funniest performance comes from Owen Wilson as a born-again preppie with an unusual interest in carpentry.

Robert De Niro is one of the best actors of all time and Ben Stiller is slowly crawling up that list but has taken the title as ""Funniest man of Earth"". This movie shows that he can be very funny and a powerfull actor at the same time. This movie had another great person but one who was working behind the scenes: Jay Roach. He has made numerous great movies (Austin Powers, Mystery, Alaska). He is one of the best directors out there. Lastly, the story in this movie was great. This was not one of those stupid funny movies. It had a great story behind it and was very funny at the same time.

1282798,2,B00003CXO1,"Shoot me if I ever go near a boat again said a famous legend. Well it's the case here if you ask me to see another comedy starring my favorite movie actor. Where as the equally brilliant Redgrave didn't mean it,I do. The Turkeys are early for Christmas this year.
 These are the type of commercial movies that pay the rent on De`niros plush Tri Becca film studios venture in Manhattan, especially now that The WTC has just fallen in his back yard. Hard to think this is the legend from many of the eighties and nineties best contemporary movies.
The parody of his best character roles in Analyze This worked well and picked up some rightful laughs on the back of The Soprano's.
That was a welcome boost for Bobbie's comic talents where as this is a major set back. He could only take roles like this if he was looking for quick bucks rather than acting accolades in drab stuff like this.
There are few laughs as the film relies on visual gags that drown out any irony. Lots of Parenthood style jokes but no brilliant comic genius of Steve Martin to save the picture. This has to be the worst casting of an actor since Rowan Atkinson in Four Weddings.
It's excruciatingly painful at times as you watch one of Americas best actors dawdle his way through such an irrelevant role. Any one could have player the picky father who wants the best for his daughter.
The gist is that Gaylord Foeker (ha ha that's funny) a male nurse played by Ben stiller ""meets the parents""of his beloved at a family wedding.
He plans also to pop the question but doesn't count on her over protective ex CIA father and line of interrogation. Little does he know the true vocation of Jack (De`niro) who he thinks is a hybrid agriculturist.
This puts the gauche Stiller into a mumbling bumbling new man wreck with the inevitable slap stick chaos.
But this is the premise for the whole film, which can only appeal to a happy ten-year-olds. The cast spends a lot of time at the dinner table and uncomfortable mingling and manners. Yet the writers didn't inject any intelligent humor here but the obvious and dull gags.
As America's biggest grossing comedy you are waiting with bated breath for the gags. Its American humor at its most tamest and dallied between Tom Hanks The Money Pit and those sassy wholesome family comedies by John Hughes.
At one point you just want the bullied Stiller to give Jack a mouthful as he persecutes the hapless weed into the ground. His schmaltzy wife Beth played by Teri Polo,ha! now that's funny is almost begging for a funny line.
It's just the sentimental pap to get America back on its feet after the terror attacks with an equally yucky Hollywood ending.
American Airlines who were at the center of the New York attacks come out really bad as far as product placement goes.
 They are constantly hammered through out over lost luggage and poor service. I'm sure their lawyers let this one slip through. At one point Stiller is thrown of for waving a suspected bomb around. Shows how much sympathy Blockbusters UK thinks of their American head office.
Theres no comedy chemistry at all between De`niro and Stiller with the rest of the cast gagless and bored. Stiller plays the same role as he does in every film as the wide-eyed innocent nice guy.
I'm surprised Spielbergs Dreamworks studios picked up this bland so called comedy. It really is dull and lingering in the Goldie Hawn bargain bucket.
America no longer makes funny films as they steer away from the brilliant Blazing Saddles and Airplane to the tedious family and teen college dross. The eighties were the only time you could get away with Road Trip in my more advanced comedy opinion.

Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a young man thinking about asking Pam (Teri Polo)to marry him. In the middle of the proposal he finds out that Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) is very strict. Rather than give a bad impression, Greg decides to ask Jack for Pam's hand in marriange.
Greg (a nurse)meets Jack for the first time, and who is introduced as a retired florist, when he is actually a retired CIA agent. Jack is instantly suspicous of his daughters boyfriend, and is bound and determined to convince Pam to drop her him.

1282801,5,B00003CXO1,"Meet The Parents: rated PG-13, 1 hour and 47 minutes
 There is chemistry between Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller in Meet The Parents, a hilarious serio-comedy that radiates a pleasant warmth. Robert De Niro is the belligerent, overprotective, overly judgmental father of the sweetheart Ben Stiller wishes to marry. Stiller's character, Greg, has fallen for the lovely Pam, played by Teri Polo, and is faced with the insufferable task of being accepted into her family in order to gain approval to marry her. Pam's father is an ex-CIA operative who is ""a human lie-detector"" and he uses this acquired skill to put Greg to the test at every possible moment, out of his irrational fear of losing his eldest daughter. When Greg is constantly set up for failure, it comes as no surprise that he becomes a failure. This is where the film reaches its most saddening moments. Though a lingering sorrow protrudes throughout a large portion of the movie, there are enough hysterical pranks and sidesplitting exchanges to keep the audiences in a light spirit and entertained.
 Jay Roach is a comical genius and he extends his soulful humor to Meet The Parents as he did so tactfully in the past with the Austin Powers movies. The script was thankfully rewritten from its original form as a one-man Jim Carrey vehicle to a head-to-head father versus son flick with Stiller and De Niro. It seems that the movie could have been easily a miss with audiences if written any other way, and feels like it just barely hits home because of all of the other comedies that have failed miserably with similar strains of humor.
 Blythe Danner is pleasing as the kooky but good-hearted mother of Greg's love interest. Teri Polo is also very good in her role as the girl being fought over by the two dominant men in her life. In addition, Jinxy the cat does an outstanding job as the extraordinarily well mannered, flamboyant, and funny family cat with whom Jack Burns (De Niro) shares a strong and intimate connection.
 Robert De Niro is at his comical peak in Meet The Parents. His mannerisms are extremely well thought out and work perfectly with the part. He is truly acting as opposed to telling jokes. He is dynamic and believable, not to mention exceedingly amusing. He outdoes his previous role in Analyze This.
 Last but not least, Ben Stiller is the heart and soul of the movie. As usual, the remarkably talented actor with a flair for comedy sparks the movie with every line and every gesture. He is such a loving protagonist that even when we watch him screw up throughout the entire movie, each time worse than the last, we still manage to forgive him. After all he is a male nurse, how can we not? In the spirit of There's Something About Mary, Mystery Men, and Keeping The Faith, Ben Stiller plays to perfection. Only this time with the addition of Robert De Niro, he surpasses our expectations of the movie and leaves us with a sweet taste in our mouths.

But you do. Blythe Danner is nicely cast as the bride to be's mother. Her wife and De Niro's husband work well together. Owen Wilson shows up playing a sickeningly perfect ex-boyfriend of Pam's. The movie is not as silly or over the top as you'd want it to be. Imagine if Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler played Stiller's part!. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor.

1282875,4,B00003CXO1,"This is a pretty funny film, which can keep one's attention for most of its duration. The basic plot is very simple : Ben Stiller's character's madly in love with his girlfriend, and wants to marry her. However, before he can propose, she takes him for a weekend at her parents' place - and then the fun begins.
His prospective father-in-law, played by Robert De Niro, is very fond of his daughter & openly disapproving, if not exactly hostile, towards this stranger who's won her heart. He also seems to have a secret up his sleeve - perhaps there is more to him than meets the eye ?
The rest of the movie is a series of mishaps and encounters between the protagonists, till things finally fall into place. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro are perfect foils for each other - which is what makes this film work. Stiller is good at playing your average guy who's slightly goofy, but essentially sincere & endearing, whereas Robert De Niro's good at just about everything, and here he does some great deadpan comedy. The support cast is ok - they don't have much to do.
The film has several laugh-out-aloud moments, and neglegibly few corny jokes. Towards the end, some unbelievable things do happen, but nobody said this was a classic or anything - it's just an enjoyable comedy, nothing more, nothing less.

1282879,4,B00003CXO1,"Funny as well as touching, ""Meet the Parents"" blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.
Co-writers Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, along with director Jay Roach, have managed to make a film that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious, the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times, these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.
The foundation for any great comedy must, first and foremost, be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  ""Meet the Parents"" does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or, as in poor Greg Focker's case, those most dreaded figures of all - the prospective in-laws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted, well-meaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam, the girl he loves.  First, however, he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father, Jack Byrnes, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.
The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true, but twisted in sly, subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg, we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father, then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick, it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg, the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness, intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality, even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily, the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro, who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy ex-CIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all, De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity, which brilliantly enhances this ""weekend from hell"" scenario.  For crazy and maddening as he can be at times, we can't help loving this character.
Finally, unlike in many other romantic dramas and comedies, the relationship between the young couple in this film is both believable and touching.  Greg and Pam are so likable - and the odds against them seem so staggering - that we find ourselves rooting them on from first moment to last.  Their moments together are genuinely touching at times, particularly in the film's closing stretches.
Kudos go out to everyone involved for making ""Meet the Parents"" one of the slyest, wittiest and flat-out funniest movies to come our way in a long, long time.",998179200,2,3780,4.769938650306749

I thought that he was REALLY psychotic. This was because he couldn't seem to stop messing things up for Greg. Plus, he expected his daughters' (Nicole DeHuff and Teri Polo) boyfriends (Thomas McCarthy and Ben Stiller) to meet him and Dina (Blythe Danner) and then ask his permission before proposing to them. If you ask me, Pam (Teri Polo) looked VERY beautiful in all the dressy clothing she wore -- Especially the maid of honor dress she wore at Bob (Thomas McCarthy) and Debbie's wedding. I especially liked Jack's tuxedo -- Especially with the top hat. If you ask me, that gave it a nice touch. The ending, however, made no sense to me. It's hard for me to explain why.

The fact that Ben Stiller LIES to her parents from the moment he meets them makes him a hero that I just didn't feel like rooting for.  He does not earn their respect and so I don't see why the audience should support the girl's parents lowering their standards to give it to him.  Yes, he is under duress from De Niro's character's demeanor, BUT we already know that he has approved of other men in his daughters' lives.  Even if he has SOME ""letting go"" issues that does not mean he should rubber stamp with approval just any body that his daughter brings home.  And I could not see why he SHOULD like Ben Stiller's character; what were his virtues precisely?
These might sound like over-critical observations but I think they are precisely what make a comedy fail or succeed.  Comedies are funny when their protagonists are worth sympathizing with as they suffer for their flaws or because of unfortunate circumstances.  There must be redeeming qualities or they must learn from the comedic results of their erroneous ways and represent our struggle to come to terms with such persistent and irrational failings.  In the end of this film, in contrast, I felt like the message was that Ben Stiller did not need to grow but that De Niro was supposed to just ""suck it up"" that his daughter loved this guy.  De Niro was the one that needed to change, not Stiller.
I just didn't like the attitude of the film, the assumption we are expected to have in running future spouses by parental inspection that one should expect a rubber stamp and that any thing else would be unnecessary harshness.  Are their some inappropriately critical parents or overprotective or unsympathetic ones, I am sure there are.  Just illustrate them in their particularity in an instance in which their injustice is obvious and not in a case where their concerns are rather valid ones, like about the integrity of the person their child is to marry.
With all this said, there are a few ""just"" laughs along the way, that are worth watching for, including ones in a pool volleyball game and those involving Ben Stiller's unfairly condescended to career prospects.  But overall, I was disappointed.",992649600,3,2791,4.619433198380567

1283026,3,B00003CXO1,"I am now thoroughly convinced that Ben Stiller is the funniest actor working today.  Even though this movie did not make a lick of sense, Stiller still made it worthwhile and hilarious as hell.  Maybe it's my imagination, but Stiller seems to be developing a meek, ineffectual, Woody Allen-ish type character.  I've seen this character in three films now, including 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Mystery Men'.  This character is most comical in stories in which they find themselves in awkward and uncomfortable social situations.  I'm about the biggest fan in the world of the Woodman but I think a squirming Ben Stiller is funnier than a squirming Woody Allen.  And just as he proved in last year's 'Analyze This', Robert DeNiro, with his dead-serious countenance and legendary past screen personas, makes the perfect straight man.  The laugh to groan ratio takes a plummet in the last 20 minutes of the film, which begs the question of why Hollywood still insists on making sappy and mawkish and completely contrived ""happy endings"".  The fun comes from watching Ben Stiller squirm, not from watching the people beside me in the audience squirm.",992390400,,1154,5.036842105263158
1283027,4,B00003CXO1,"Greg Focker (Stiller), a male nurse from Chicago, wants to marry his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), but first he must ask her father (DeNiro) for permission.  The couple travel to her parent's home in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and all hell breaks loose.
Greg desperately wants to be accepted by his hopeful future in-laws, and will go to any length to ingratiate himself - which is his problem.  He will say or do anything to make these people like him, and with Pam's dad, it's a losing proposition.  A retired CIA profiler, DeNiro is suspicious and distrustful, and a private war, with Pam as the object, begins as soon as they meet.
At its core, Meet the Parents wants to be a Peter Sellers farce, and at many points it works (and I could actually see Sellers playing both roles - maybe even at once in a case of stunt casting along the lines of The Party and Dr Strangelove).  The film is basically a series of screw-ups, each more excruciating than the last, and Roach does a good job of creating serious tension without ever letting things get too over the top.
What sells the tension, though, are the performances of Stiller and DeNiro.  DeNiro has been on a comedy kick recently, and this is his best comedic performance yet.  He is able to do more with a single reaction shot than most comedic actors can do with a whole performance.  Stiller is making a career out of roles like this - the nervous, skittery put-upon guy.
I've heard people complain that Meet the Parents is sitcomish.  What I think they are really getting at is the movie's basic geniality.  Even when the film tries to be edgy (and having a cat pee on someone's ashes is definitely edgy), it never goes over the line to be mean spirited or crude.  While both Stiller and DeNiro do things that are destructive and potentially cruel, both actors are able to sell the basic humanity of the characters - you know their motivations and are willing to forgive their ridiculous behavior.
Meet the Parents isn't pushing the envelope the way a Farrelly Brothers movie does - on the commentary track Roach mentions that he agonized over including what toilet humor there is in the film. It does manage to get in some classic moments (including one of the best chase scenes I have ever seen, and a third act airport scene that is priceless), and the supporting performances are great as well.  Owen Wilson is hilarious as Pam's ex-boyfriend who can do no wrong, James Rebhorn brings the best pronunciation of ""Focker"" to the proceedings, and Blythe Danner quietly steals almost every scene she's in.
I didn't see this movie in the theatres, and without renting it, I bought it on DVD, and was pretty happy with it the first time. The next time around, I was glad that I bought this. Great story with comedy with the usual ending.",992131200,7,2793,4.577154308617234

MY REVIEW:
""Why do people say this movie's hilarious?  Sure, it has a few funny scenes, but it's not that die hard laughable!  Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro both are really good with their performances, but the big time humor just wasn't in the script!  This movie is funny here and there, but just doesn't hit the spot.  For a more hilarious movie, see LIAR LIAR, or AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  I recommend if you want to see this movie, don't buy it, rent it.

Ben Stiller is no slouch either and is the consumate funny man himself.  Meet the Parents touches on both the funny side of meeting the inlaws, and the more serious issues of parents letting go of their little girl.  As a male nurse, Stiller's character challenges DeNiro's friends definition of status (they're doctors) and gender roles by being proud of his professional choices.  Meet The Parents left me rolling on the floor laughing and yet at the same time it made me think.  Excellent indeed!",992044800,,606,4.844660194174757

Owen Wilson did a good job as usual, but the rest was just blah. So far, I have found only a handful of people who have enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It had the potential but just didn't click.

1283102,4,B00003CXO1,"The movie ""Meet the Parents"", direced by Jay Roach, is, in my opinion, way better than either of the ""Austin Powers"" movies (seeing as they share the same director).  It's really one of the funniest movies Hollywood has spit out in a while.  Ben Stiller seems to take a lot of credit because of his ""funny the first time"" name: Gaylord Focker.  In this film Ben Stiller really 'plays out' the timid, normal, misunderstood by everybody except the audience character.  But he does it beautifully; so beautifully that he should never play that character again.  Rober DeNiro plays Ben Stiller's girlfriends dad.  And, yes, Ben wants to ask for her hand in marriage but can't quite do it.  Robert DeNiro plays this character pefectly as he always does, he really gets deep into his characters.  The best thing about the movie is that every time you watch it, you see something that makes it a better movie.  The best jokes are really not his name, the thong, or his name.

There was too much time watching and waiting for things to happen.  Apparently, the director was assuming that the audience had little or no imagination.  I laughed at a few things, but, I felt this movie was a waste of my time, money, and gas to pick it up at the video store. I was constantly feeling uncomfortable for Ben Stiller, yet, thinking how stupid he was for his lies.  I did like how he ruined the wedding plans for De Niro's other daughter, but, that was a long drawn out breath. If the young people today consider this funny, they need to gain a little more depth to them. This movie appears to be a rough draft instead of a finished product.

1283104,2,B00003CXO1,"...Monstrous Money Maker, it's just a Shame that Nothing on the Screen is Deserving of the Praise that Critics and Audiences greeted ""Meet the Parents"" with. Without Robert De Niro's Involvement, the film would Never have even hit the big-screen; it would have been sent to Video Hell where it Belongs.
Ben Stiller stars as Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker (a joke which is funny once or twice, but used over and over until it becomes plain stupid, and there are Rumour's that they are basing the Sequel around this one joke, lets hope that it Is just a rumour), he has Popped the Question to his Girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo), who is a Little Hesitant as he still hasn't... Met her Parents. If you Can't predict the rest of the film, then I Don't see you having a future as a Clairvoyant. Predictability is the Name of the Game in this film, it all feels as Stale as a 2 week old piece of Toast. Freshness is out the window and Familiarity is in, and Obviously, there is Profit to be had in Predictability.
This films Success Boggles the Mind; it is Totally Devoid of Anything New (while Riskier and Better comedies like ""Little Nicky"" and ""Lucky Numbers"" opened alongside it and Flopped as their Marketing Campaigns weren't as huge. Marketing seems to be were all the Effort went in this film). We've seen it all before in Countless Steve Martin films, It has an Annoying central performance by Ben Stiller and Irritating Supporting characters (including Polo, Blyth Danner as Dina, De Niro's wife, Jon Abrahams as Denny, De Niro's son and Owen Wilson as Kevin Rawley, a friend of the family). Only De Niro shines... Which was always going to happen. He seems to Know that the film is nothing special and he's just there for some Fun, or a Fat Pay Check, if so, he made a clever move, if he Actually attempted to make a Quality Film, he failed. He is a Consummate Professional who Always Rises to the Occasion. This film is No Different, it's a Shame this Trait couldn't rub off on his Co-stars.
""Meet the Parents"" has Flat Spots at every corner, the Occasional moment of Hilarity (especially towards the end, the Airport scene had more Originality then every other scene combined), Tired Directing by the Usually Energetic Jay Roach and a Screenplay that could Very well have been an Unproduced screenplay from the Silent era, as most of the Chuckles come from De Niro's Facial Expressions.

1283107,2,B00003CXO1,"I'm not as hard on fluff as some of my artsy-fartsy friends. As long as I know it's fluff going in (and anyone who'd be expecting more than ""fluff"" from Meet the Parents is beyond help), I tend to be fairly easily amused, one way or the other.
And Meet the Parents is just that -- amusing. A chucklesome diversion. It has a few decent laughs, but I entirely concede with any reviewer declaring that the movie is unoriginal, off the mark, and that the performances are nothing to write home about.
I think a lot of people were disappointed because -- formulaic and trite as the concept of the film may be -- De Niro as the gruff, humorless future father-in-law, and Stiller as the hapless young son-in-law to be, for whom nothing will go right -- seemed like promising casting with real comedic potential. And in the end, it's not that the movie is altogether unfunny -- it's just that it's not, you know, THAT funny. You may smile, or chuckle, or even laugh out loud a few times, but you're not going to be rolling around on the floor. And towards the end, the film becomes oddly serious -- almost a tad depressing. Which rubs people the wrong way when they are ... well ... expecting pure, light-hearted fluff.
Lacking in the hilarity department, it would help a great deal if Meet the Parents had some of the other qualities which I have already pointed out are missing -- originality, stellar performances, a witty and/or multilayered script. But these elements are nowhere to be seen. The ""cute pet Ben Stiller hates and doesn't get along with"" was already done in Something About Mary. The ""intimidating, protective, grumpy father"" schtick has been milked for all it was worth and more in movies like Father of the Bride. And the ""what ELSE could go wrong? -- OH, THAT! HA HA!"" style of humor, at this point in the development of mainstream comedy, is getting really, really tiresome. If you're going to do it, you need to do it well, and Meet the Parents only does it so-so.
Ben Stiller, though not unsympathetic, gets pretty annoying after a while. I was only half-heartedly pulling for him. I'm not a big Stiller fan though. His whiney method of delivery rakes on my nerves. De Niro can of course hold his own, but his dialogue is fairly stilted, and the whole bit about him being a CIA agent -- aggh. Over-the-top, stupid, and not half as funny as it'd like to be. He has a good line here or there (""I have nipples. Could you milk me?""), but, fluff or no, I was expecting a little more.
De Niro's wife -- oof -- bad move. She isn't funny at all. She comes off as really patheticly submissive and mindless, although I think they were TRYING for super-sweet and well-intended. I couldn't stand her. She reminded me of Ricky Fitts' mom in American Beauty. And those who have seen the movie recognize that that's more depressing than funny.
So what it boils down to is that even for fluff, this one falls a bit short. But it passes the time, and has amusing moments here and there.",990921600,,2986,4.490808823529412

The situation has lots of potential, and the cast is good. Somehow, though, it just doesn't quite click. I chuckled at times, but it just never totally cracked me up.

Also, the father is sooo uptight that you sympathize with Greg, the boyfriend, for just trying to do whatever it takes to get through the weekend despite the always disastrous consequences.

3. To enjoy the movie at most, get the general picture of the story but do not focus on the details as if it can ever be true or not!

Stiller's confused, sympathetic, Greg Focker is warm from the start, and Blythe Danner (as his future mom-in-law) wins the audience over immediately with her constant need for unity and calm, even if it is only appearances. De Niro's Jack Byrnes is a little stilted, a perfect foil for Stiller's over-the-top antics. But even Stiller has toned down his physical comedy.

Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), an interestingly named male nurse, wants to ask his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him.  But first, he must get the consent of her father, Jack (Robert De Niro).  From the moment they meet, Jack does everything in his power to find fault in Greg, who, as the opening song says, is a nice guy and therefore a loser.  Throughout the entire movie, Focker (a word which is never spoken without director Jay Roach attempting to make you laugh through repetitive and childish mishearing of the name) is the target of sarcasm and criticism whenever anyone talks to him.  When Greg goes to do something, all he manages to do is abuse himself or destroy things through tedious, overdone sight gags which are never more than a string of unfortunate coincidences.  This results either in more scolding and caustic remarks or an uncomfortable silence followed, of course, by more humiliation for Focker.
When all is said and done, Meet the Parents utterly fails at making a good, entertaining movie.  The complete dehumanization and humiliation of Greg Focker, aimed at making the audience like him through sympathy for his situation, only serves to disappoint rather than entertain.  We all have bad days, but suspending disbelief for the entire one hundred eight minutes of movie is harder than making it through the longest bad day.",989107200,2,1552,4.7611940298507465

If you're in the mood for a movie you don't have to think about, and you like watching people humiliate themselves then by all means see it. But only a mindless idiot could give this film five stars.",989020800,,502,4.651685393258427

Its one of those movies everyone can relate to.  We all know what its like to meet someone you're desperately trying to impress, and we all know what its like to fail.  You find yourself rooting for Greg Focker, our hopeless hero.  Women can especially relate with Pam, seeing as we all have fathers like Jack, and men can relate with Jack because that's how they treat their daughters.  As for Pam's mom (I can't think of her name at the moment), she's so eccentric and ditzy that you can't help but love her.
The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because, the DVD features were not as spectacular as I thought they would be.  I enjoyed the 2 deleted scenes--they should have been left in the movie--and the ""lie detector"" tests were amusing.  However, I was VERY disappointed with the outtakes.  They were touted for weeks on shows like ""Access Hollywood"" and in the DVD commercials as being ""hilarious"" and ""unmissable"", but I found them boring and lacking in humor.  The only good outtake is the one of Ben Stiller trying to create the perfect dinner prayer--its the only one that got so much as a smile out of me.

My wife and I wanted to rent a comedy and heard that Meet the Parents was a great comedy. I guess people will laugh at anything really stupid, which this movie is; very stupid and not very funny. The best scene, by far, is when Ben Stiller is on the roof trying to get the cat and what happens after that. That's it. Typical Hollywood ending too. Very disappointed. After this movie my wife and I watched Charlie's angels which (I can't believe I'm saying this) was a much funnier and more enjoyable movie. Meet the parents also dragged a lot.

This movie tried to hit the same vein of humor as Something About Mary, but missed at almost every occasion.  Nothing in this movie seemed to click.  De Niro's character came across as both poorly written and poorly acted.
We almost turned this movie off 5 or 6 different times, but finally ended up watching the whole thing just to see how it ended.  So I guess I can say that it does it least have that going for it.",988070400,2,635,3.9296875

1283253,4,B00003CXO1,"I decided to rent ""Meet the Parents"" from a recomendation from one of my freinds. And it turned out to be a very entertaing, freshing departure from the norm of most comedy's. Here's something i could sort of relate to...well not entirly. But i could sort of undertsand where this guy is coming from. Meets the parents of your love one for the first time, it could be quit tough, i mean trying to impress them, showing them that your willing to go out of their way for their daughter , that you really deserve her. And while trying to do such a thing can be quit troublesome, ..Trust me, i know...boy do I know. And alot what you try to get across comes out the wrong way, not the way you intended. It's either how you come across to the folks, how you talk, how smart you are, your likes, your dislikes, how willing you are, coming up with one single converstation that won't fall flat in the last 2 minutes. And as much as you try, you could never get where you want to go. This could be just as depressing when it comes to acutally talking and trying to impress a girl in general, a girl that seems to like you, but in a way doesn't. Your confused , you don't know what to think, your verbal comunication with her,...can be alot better than it is. The trouble is that you don't know how to fully open up around her. Sure your a nut-ball when it comes being around your best buds. But when your around her, everything is different. Theres a simple joy of seeing her happy, seeing that cute smile of hers'. You try and you try, and from day to day it seems less sucessful, you look back at the days when your did thought were impresing her, and say to yourself.""Maybe I should just give up.."" Then your realize it wasn't their doing,..but yours. It's your disadvantage of being who you are. Your shy, your not very good at making conversation, and you then blame it all on yourself. And when that happens depression kicks into full gear. You find yourself doing things that you wouldn't normally do, walking the town for no reason, just collecting your thoughts, as you sip a cold beer. Life can be cruel, but you know what, you are your own worst enemy. Time goes on, and after a while and you don't know what to think. All of this is what this movie represents, while I was watching this, I really felt bad for the guy, but it made me think on how pointless and unmeaningful my life really is. Here is a guy who in the end really suceeded, who acutally made it to FIRST base. This is one of the main reasons what made this movie so charming. And in the end I really felt for them , and i was really happy for the couple. Becasue I was seeing something that will never happen to me, something I yern for. Something that I wish for, with this girl that i really love. There's all these conflicting images, and symbols, one of them being the ex-boyfreind, the competion, the struggle. In my case the boyfriend that has her, and doesn't seem to let her go. But in the end the ex-boyfreind winds up being greatful, forgiving, happy for his new rival. That he is lucky enough to have such a great girl, I tend to feel the same way at times, I think , well as long as she is happy, i'll be happy. And you want to tell her boyfreind that he is the luckyiest SOB on the planet, and he is. This movie is both touching, and flat-out Hilarious. This film is just as much a comedy as it is a Love Satire, and it's a winner in both areas. The peformances are wonderful, Robert De Niro never fails to impress me, one of the greatest dramatic actors who ever lived, and what a shame it would be, when he finnally leaves us, something I would never hope for. And Ben Stillar is just fine as the new forth-coming son-in-law, who brings and air of forgiveness and warmth to it all. All n' all a great, meaningful comedy thats a true winner and , Which i more than recommend.  Cheers,Ash'.

Robert DeNiro is just OK (although the fawning that he does over his cat is very funny and reminiscent of how many parents act when their nest becomes almost empty!).

1283462,4,B00003CXO1,"You probably could've slapped a ""National Lampoon's"" label on this movie, and no one would no the difference. Mainly because in this movie, Greg Focker reminds me a lot of Clark Griswold. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. I happen to love the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. That's probably why I liked Meet The Parents so much, because it probably would've fit right in.
Basically, this movie involves Greg Focker, a male nurse, who's about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam. They fly home to, well, meet the parents. At first, Greg seems a bit frightened by Pam's father, Jack. Why? Because Jack happens to be an ex-CIA agent. That's when the Griswold-esque situations start to happen. He pops champagne, and the cork hits the urn containing Jack's mother's ashes. Then the cat, well, you know. (ed note - the review title comes from the cat scene where Greg talks about milking a cat) Then, while playing volleyball, he gives Pam's sister, a one week away bride-to-be, a black eye. He gets arrested for saying the word ""Bomb"" on an airplane. Let's not forget the infamous lie-detector test scene. There's also some hilarious marijuana references (Puff the Magic Dragon has a whole new meaning), and some rather disturbing scenes involving the cat using the toilet. And so on, and so forth.
As for the DVD, the video's great. You can see everything perfectly clear. Universal seems to take DVD very seriously (which all movie studios should do), and the quality really shows on this one. However, they need to do more with the extras. The extras - you get the standard commentary track, two deleted scenes which aren't very funny, the standard DVD trailer, and outtakes, mainly which show you the fact that Robert De Niro has a hard time keeping a straight face. Otherwise, this is a very funny movie, and a great buy. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one gets an 8 1/2.",986428800,,1878,4.711246200607903

1283465,3,B00003CXO1,"I have to say the Robert DeNiro is one of my favorites actors.  His work in this movie as an overprotective, paranoid father who is also a CIA operative is very good.  Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many scenes that are just plain mean-spirited.  It seems that the cruelty is forced, the run-ins between DeNiro and Stiller are telegraphed, and the change in DeNiro's character at the end is not believable.  I know this is a comedy, but the rules for consistent behavior should still apply.
You could understand a father being a little concerned about his bright, beautiful daughter being in love with a guy who, to him, just doesn't measure up.  But to see him and his friends be so openly cruel to the guy is not really fun to watch.  If the characters were a bit more odd (versus stereotyped) it might have worked.
There are bright moments - Blyther Danner as DeNiro's wife gives just the right amount of ""I love him, but I'm also a little scared of him"" attitude to her role.  And Owen Wilson, as the ex-boyfriend of DeNiro's daughter is wonderful to watch, as usual.
The DVD is fine in terms of audio and video, and the extras make the package a good value.  It's just a shame that the movie plays out like a bad Farrelly brothers film.

Well, the father could be Robert DeNiro.  You *could* set the lawn on fire.  You might even desicrate his mother's remains.
The wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes that simple question ""what's the worst that could happen,"" and runs it in all the most terrifying directions.  The deep down fear that is the core of this film is common to everyone, so when we see how bad it could possibly get, we relate, and therefore laugh.
DeNiro is wonderful in kidding his tough-guy image as a former CIA agent who now has nothing better to do than run background checks on his daughters' boyfriends, and all the fun he had during the making of the film shows up onscreen.  Stiller plays the beleagured Craig Focker with the same earnest appeal that made him so popular in ""There's Something About Mary.""  So what if he makes his own problems by lying to improve his image?  We like him anyway.
Though some of the gags are way overused (I can only hear the name ""Focker"" yelled so many times before it gets old), the film works by sticking to its central theme.  After all, who *isn't* afraid when they first ""Meet the Parents?""",985824000,,1406,4.561752988047809

1283470,4,B00003CXO1,"I imagine the people that didn't like this flick probably watched it alone, or maybe with a significant other. Many comedies need a group viewing (theatres obviously work best) to get the full laugh effect. I viewed ""Parents"" twice: once alone with my wife, and again the next day with a few relatives over. It was definitely ""funnier"" the second time. Likewise, my 2nd screening of ""American Pie"" (solo) did not produce nearly the same laughs as my first screening with my beer-swilling friends. I believe setting has a lot to do with how a comedy is perceived.
That said, ""Parents"" was a funny flick. I am not a big DeNiro in a comedy setting, but he handled himself great here. Ben Stiller has obviously found his niche and was again funny here. Teri Polo looked juicy and held her own with Stiller and DeNiro. The future in-law family was incredibly funny, and Owen Michael as the rich ex-fiance was a gem.
The running gag on Ben Stiller's last name (Focker) never got old, and managed to generate laughs by itself. The cat storyline was cute. The DVD has some great extra features which add a half star to my rating.

1283546,4,B00003CXO1,"Meet the Parents
Score: 83/100
Well-known for the last 2 Austin Powers films, Jay Roach has become a class act of a comedy director since the release of the first Powers film in 1997. In 1999, he made the sequel, and now, instead of sequelizing and spoofing, Roach has turned to remakes, and with Meet the Parents, he proudly surpasses his sequel to Austin Powers, and with his star-studded cast, the team have come up with a sporadically funny motion picture, a must-see for all people who want a good laugh, any time of the day.
A Jewish male nurse named Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to ask his live-in girl friend Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him. However, he learns that her strict father Jack (Robert DeNiro) expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Thus begins the visit from Hell as the two travel to meet Mum (Blythe Danner) and Dad, who turns out to be former CIA with a lie detector in the basement. Coincidentally, a sister (Nicole DeHuff) of Pam's also has announced her wedding to a young doctor (Thomas McCarthy). Of course everything that can go wrong does, including the disappearance of Dad's beloved Himalayan cat, Jinxie.
Of course, Jay Roach has made sequels and spoofs and now remakes, but he doesn't insist on other pieces of film to make the film that he has created. This film is very different to the 1992 smash hit and much, much better. There are many reasons to praise this oddball film, including it's eagerness to keep the audience entertained by using totally new jokes we never saw coming. Another thing is its great performance from the cast. Robert DeNiro does comedy again and he hasn't been this good in God knows how long, Ben Stiller is truly hilarious as Greg Focker (that's comedy for you!), he is quickly becoming one of my favourite comedic performers. Also on the hotline are Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, especially Danner as a nice mother caught in funny, difficult and totally strange situations.
Meet the Parents is, quite simply, the most plausible romantic comedy of the year 2000! Hats off for a stunning little film that boasts continuous watchability.",985651200,2,2127,4.720430107526882
1283547,4,B00003CXO1,"Meet the Parents is a hilarious movie that parallels the relationship between a typical father/future son-in-law when they first meet. The movie takes place as the daughter and future son-in-law visit the parents for a family wedding. Laughter abounds as Ben Stiller, who plays the future son-in-law Greg Focker, encounters one disastrous event after another. Focker feels he must fit in with the family and impress the father, Jack Byrnes, so he can marry his daughter, Pam. The role of the father is played expertly by Robert DeNiro.  He is a C.I.A. agent and an overprotective father who only wants his daughter to marry the right man. Pam played by Teri Polo, is in love with Greg when she goes with him to visit her parents, but that love is severely tested as Jack continually makes mistakes such as losing her father's cat and then bringing home an imposter cat. The funniest scene in the movie is one in which Greg, eager to please the family, offers to open a bottle of champagne, and ends up knocking an urn holding Jack's mother's ashes on the floor, at which time the beloved family cat urinates on the ashes.  Things only get worse for Greg. This movie is sure to make you laugh.  Stiller and DeNiro's roles are classics.",985478400,,1234,4.67741935483871
1283548,5,B00003CXO1,"This is probably one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films ever produced. The reason- because it is so realistic. The acting by Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller is world class. The story and theme of the film relates so perfectly to a typical real life situation- where the son in law desperately wants the father in laws acceptance. Yes, Greg Fokker(Ben Stiller) is portrayed as your typical loser,worst of all he has got to try and impress a really heavy handed and uncompromising retired CIA official of a future father in law Jack Byrnes(Robert De Niro) who immediately takes a disliking to poor old Greg. As if he is already up against it he finds he has to live up to the standards of the other son in law-a doctor whose parents can easily relate to Jack. Jack becomes a real horror for Greg who finds his fiancee Pam's whole family in an uncompromising mood towards Greg. So, how does Greg try and win in this situation?Well,I can guarantee you one thing,whatever he does ends up being really hillarious. It is thoroughly worth watching,a type of movie that keeps you interested from start to finish,quite remarkable. It really deserves its 5 star rating. First class entertainment.

The plot centers around Greg who plans to ask his girlfriend's father for permission to marry her.  He's a male nurse who feels out of his depth with his prospective father-in-law.  The more he tries to please and impress him, the worse things become.  There are some slapstick moments, with the comic highlight being the family pet, a cat, who has been trained to use the toilet.  Somehow the movie never quite jells and it's hard to care about the characters.  The father-in-law, played by Robert DeNiro, spends the movie testing and torturing the object of his daughter's affections and then unaccountably changes his tune completely with just a single gentle admonition from his wife.",985305600,,861,4.816326530612245

1283636,4,B00003CXO1,"I believe the term 'snowball effect' would be apt in describing the overall plot of Meet the Parents.  Good-hearted Gaylord 'Greg' Focker has the biggest cloud of doom hanging over him on the weekend that he visits his girlfriend, Pam's, family--especially in the eyes of her hard-as-nails judgmental father.  Greg wants to make the best impression possible, as he desperately wants to marry Pam.  Time after time, Greg tries to get on Pam's father's good side, only to have each scheme blow up in his face--not to mention almost ruining a family wedding and destroying the house!
Ben Stiller again plays a loveable guy next door.  He and Robert DeNiro (Pam's father) have terrific chemistry as old buck and young buck trying to keep Pam's affections.  The DVD also has some great outtakes and deleted scenes.  Great for a night when you want to do nothing but laugh.",985046400,3,867,4.824324324324325
1283637,4,B00003CXO1,"If you had asked me what I thought the odds were that comics Stiller and Maera could have a son who would become a leading man in romantic comedies, I would have said, ""Nil.""  Certainly one could never picture either parent in such a role.  Nevertheless, their son Ben is amazingly good playing such roles and will probably carve out quite a niche for himself in Hollywood.  That he can be absolutely adorable, engaging, funny and charming certainly helps.  I've seen him play other types of roles but this is the one where he is commercially the hottest.

In this film, he wants to marry Robert DeNiro's daughter but DeNiro is a retired CIA man who is the potential father-in-law from hell. DeNiro plays this role almost too well.  I saw the movie with my friend Joyce and she said that after meeting DeNiro and the rest of the family, she would have found another girlfriend were she Ben Stiller! I think DeNiro does go a bit over the top in this film but he and Stiller manage to be quite funny despite that.  I think this is an engaging movie and you will enjoy it as an evening's entertainment at home.

Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro play against each other extremely well here.  The comedy is intelligent.  The gags are not overly kid-like (see Scary Movie or and Jim Carrey flick).

I was downstairs that evening upgrading the operating system on a machine and I heard cackling from my sons' bedroom.  My boys are 13 and 14, and my daughter is 10.  My older son came downstairs and did something to make my installation work. As his reward for his unsolicited assistance, he wanted permission to ""cackle"" for the next 24 hours.  I usually forbid that annoying form of laughter, but I granted his wish.
Was I ever sorry!  As I attempted to sleep in the room next to the one with the DVD playing ""Meet the Parents"", I was assaulted with endless cackling.  (Spoiler) Spray painting a cat's tail and word play on Gaylord (gay) f..er are simply not humorous to someone of legal drinking age.

When I look over other opinions, it makes me realize that sometimes we have to go into another part of our brain to find the humor in some movies.  For example, American Pie, is not your ""classic, clean-cut"" comedy.  But it's funny.  I felt there was enough humor with spurts of seriousness to make it a good movie.  The acting was good and to minimize DeNiro's ""credibilty"" as an actor because he did this film is saying this man can only play serious characters.  DeNiro was funny and scary.  Some of the lines were predictably dorky but that's simply what this movie is about.
Because this movie uses a different type of humor I would suggest renting it before buying it.",984787200,2,917,4.321637426900585
1283642,2,B00003CXO1,"Stale, unoriginal humor is the downfall of this take-it-or-leave-it Ben Stiller comedy. Stiller plays male nurse Gaylord Focker (whose name is the inspiration for at least a quarter of the movie's jokes), a hapless soul whose attempts to propose to his girlfriend (Teri Polo) are interrupted by a phone call announcing her sister's engagement. This leads to the wedding trip, and Stiller's opportunity to meet the parents.
What follows are a series of mildly amusing situations and one-liners, none of which you'll probably be itching to repeat at work tomorrow. Owen Wilson is a bright spot, as usual, playing Polo's ex-fiance. He also delivers the best line in the movie, a deadpan joke about the inspiration for his hobby, carpentry. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner, however, are both too woefully underchallenged to be able to turn in memorable performances.
The DVD's extra features include the standard outtakes, commentaries, and deleted scenes, as well as interactive personality quizzes which are fun to take but whose answers seem somewhat random. Overall, Meet the Parents is only worth renting if you're desperate to see a movie and this is the just about only thing left on the video store shelves.",984787200,6,1211,5.152284263959391

Ben stiller is funny, and holds the few actually comedic moments of the movie together, but other than his performance, little of the film is comedic.
DeNiro plays his role in his usual strict and stern manner, with intensity that is lost on the plot. The comedic elements that are stung along between him and Stiller have their moments, but all in all have been done a thousand times in a thousand other movies and have lost their charm.
This movie is for you if you like formulaic comedy, cannot get enough of childish sex and potty jokes and enjoy watching a man struggle against an impossible in-law.

The premise is believable for about ten seconds, then all this mumbo jumbo about DeNiro's character being linked with the CIA and mixing that with his odd attachment to his cat, a bizarre Oedipal thing for his mother's ashes and poor poetry interpretation skills, coupled with the horror of painfully watching Blythe Danner try to sleepwalk her way through her role was torturous.  Add this to the simple fact Ben Stiller is NOT FUNNY, and I can't possibly give you a valid reason to watch this piece of trash which made tons of money at the box office.

Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with ""There's Something About Mary"" are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than ""Mary"".  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.
I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.
Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (""Flawless"", ""Analyze This"", ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"").  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film ""Fifteen Minutes"" which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.
This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a fun flick with absurdly exaggerated humor and numerous belly laughs, but don't expect it to be as good as ""Mary"".",984009600,,2039,4.637883008356546

De Niro plays the perfect straight edge, conservative parent whom Stiller just cant seem to please.  You can feel for Stiller every time he bungles, and that makes it all more engaging and funny.

If you are reading this review then most likely you've seen the others and have a general sense of the plotline.  I won't bore you with banal details.  This is Ben Stiller trying to cash in on the same vein as There's Something About Mary (I really didn't think this was funny either).  It is predictible slapstick which fails miserably to be funny.  Too many stupid things occur in this film and it just becomes annoying.
It is also sad to see De Niro in this role.  You think of Goodfellas, Casino, and Taxi Driver and then this.  He should know that after almost thirty years in film that comedies are not his strong-suit.  I felt bad seeing him in this film.

1283948,3,B00003CXO1,"The problem I have with this movie is that I am getting sick and tired of seeing Ben Stiller in roles that imitate his grounbreaking act in ""There's Something About Mary"". I believe Mr. Stiller should stop making films for a while and start thinking about his career. Otherwise he is on his way to becoming a Jerry Lewis of sorts. Not that being Jerry Lewis is bad, but look at Edward Norton with which he shares starring roles in ""Keeping the Faith"". Edward Norton can play in any movie from Fight Club to American History X, whereas Ben Stiller has himself cornered into copycat comedy roles.
Apart from my views on Stiller, this is a good movie where at some point there are so many disasters taking place around Focker that you start to get an uneasy feeling about the whole thing. And of course when everything is resolved at the end (as it should) you give out the breath that you had been holding. It really gets disturbing at some points (the cat, the fire, the big wedding suprise...).
As ever, the great De Niro is a formidable character. This man is so good he commands the movie. His presence is what makes this film attractive. Others just move in and out of scenes. If it weren't for the disasters he creates, even Stiller would hardly be noticed beside Robert De Niro.
All in all, if you like Stiller buy it. If you like De Niro, buy it. If you want a good laugh.. well, there are better alternatives (""Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels"" from Guy Ritchie, for example).",982886400,,1484,4.459558823529412

This film has Ben Stiller basically reprising his character from There's Something About Mary, but still manages to include all the charm and comic timing. He plays Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker(this name provides some of the best jokes in the film!)who after proposing to the woman he loves, heads to her parents home to meet with them.
Unfortunately, this includes her father, a retired florist played by the always-incredible Robert De Niro. He immediately takes a disliking to Greg with a hard edge towards him, and some of the best scenes that follow is him trying to impress De Niro. One of the first laugh-out-loud scenes involves a dear family member's cremated ashes being treated rather unconventionally after a series of mishaps at the dinner table. I won't go into details, because I do not want to spoil it. There are a few plot twists later on that keep the story fresh, mostly regarding De Niro's retired florist.
There are not too many movies that I recommend you buy without seeing first, especially comedies, because so many people have different tastes in comedies.

Directed by Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers movies, ""Meet the Parents"" guarantees some great laughs as Stiller tries his hardest to gain the approval of DeNiro, who just wants the best for his daughter. The jokes and gags are quite better than the Farelly brothers' gross-out toilet humor, mostly because of DeNiro's great performance, which rivals his other recent comedic role in ""Analyze This"", which I also recommend if you want to see the other side of DeNiro.

There was nothing funny about it at all and I initially thought it was a HUGE mistake on the part of DeNiro and Stiller to do a film like this.  I had NO intention of seeing what looked to me like a one-joke, sophomoric film aimed at people in their teens and 20s, at the exclusion of the rest of us old fogies.
So what happened?
Opening week, good word of mouth, great reviews...
So the next weekend, I went in and found myself howling out loud, doubled over at how crazy and deliriously funny this picture was.
The thing you have to remember is that trailers and ads usually give away most of the best scenes and are solely responsible for getting people off their rears and into their cars and into their seats at the theater.  A marketer's job is to make a bad film into a winner on opening weekend, at whatever cost.  This is why so many bad films come up big at the box office on opening day and then peeter out in a couple of weeks.  To make matters worse, I was unimpressed with the ads and trailers to ""Meet the Parents.""  I hated the whole ad campaign as much as those dumb commercials on TV by an unnamed hamburger chain.
But while watching ""Meet the Parents,"" the context of these scenes were fleshed out and the result was equal parts nonsense and intelligence.  It made the film a first class winner, the funniest picture of the year.
Please note that I PAY to see more than 50 films a year, and I don't do it for a living.  Seeing movies in a theater are a joy, and to me, time is more important than money.  ""Meet the Parents"" lowered my expectations going in and it came out a winner, big time.  It's on my list of the top ten pictures released in 2000.
I was amazed at how the story piled on layer after layer of wild situations; it was like watching one of those great screwball romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.  The best thing about ""Meet the Parents"" is that the material is not, as one favorable critic put it, ""dumbed down"" despite its premise.  You FEEL for Stiller's predicaments and his frustration as things get worse.  And when it does, it doesn't make you feel exasperated, impatient or frustrated.  It's hilarious.  You also FEEL for DeNiro's suspicions as an overly protective father who borders on being chillingly insane.  My favorite scenes are the ""crying poem recital,"" the ""drag race"" (won't say anything more about those, see them yourself!) and the stuff going on at the airport.
So the trailers had me fooled.
Reflecting back, there were two keys to this film's success.
The first key is the execution of each scene.  You might not be impressed when someone tries to explain the film to you, but when you see it on the big screen, you see how there is a logical progression to the insanity that develops in ""Meet the Parents.""  The insanity, it's hard to explain, makes sense when it plays out, and it doesn't take any marvelous or expensive special effects to ""push"" the comedy at all.  It's played straight and that's what makes ""Meet the Parents"" funny.
The second key to the success of ""Meet the Parents"" is the most important...
Ben Stiller is so damned perfect for this role.
Despite the sheer nuttiness of this film and the horrible situations he gets thrown in, Stiller's innate intelligence comes through.  Despite what happens, he's not an idiot.  His reactions are priceless and he doesn't play the role as a dufus.  He's a guy with common sense who desperately wants acceptance by DeNiro.  That's why you root for him.  He's not overly attractive in any conventional way -- but his charisma as an actor in this role shines because he does what he does best -- and that is to play each scene like a smart guy who can't believe the things that can go wrong IN SPITE of the well thought out, meticulous planning and foresight that any smart person would do, and he demonstrates as much to the audience when he goes through the motions to try to please his fiancee's family in a big, big way.  When he fails, he can't believe it.  And neither do we.
""Meet the Parents"" is wall-to-wall fun, the most pleasant movie-going surprise of 2000.  And the ending is wonderful.  The last scene before the credits is practically given away in the trailer (again, I won't mention it), but where they put it in the film is priceless...

Greg Focker is a nurse who, before asking his girlfriend to marry him, must visit her parents and o.k. it with them. Things seem to be going well enough when he picks up the wrong bag at the airport, causing the oncoming hell that is 'Meeting the parents'.

Well... scratch that, I do know: appealing to a demographic.  To put it mildly, if you are over 40, you might find this movie amusing.  If seeing Robert Deniro hang around his suburban home in a yuppie cardigan with his airhead wife, incessantly yapping about inane topics, and preening over his beloved pet cat makes you smile, then maybe this movie hits close enough to home for you to see a reflection.
Honestly, I laughed ONCE during this whole flick (two words: ""kitty litter"") but that was IT.  Stiller plays the same whiny little schmuck he always plays, his ""girlfriend"" is about as compelling as an end table, Deniro is so obviously hamming up his unlikeable role as ""tough father-in-law"" that you can smell him coming a mile away, and his wife is... completely an accessory.  The other players are bit-parts that make no difference.
This movie just pillages the toilet jokes and ""wacky"" humor of so many of today's poor excuses for films (Something About Mary, any Jim Carrey movie) and then DUMBS IT DOWN a few notches for the sake of the over-the-hill crowd.  The jokes are so tired and so predictable, and SO ham-fisted that it is truly an insult to the intelligence of anyone who sees this tripe.  And I hope you all will see it for exactly what it is: slowing down the ""comedy du jour"" so the old folks can catch up.
This is about as entertaining as Lawrence Welk at a Matlock convention.  Will somebody please pass the prunes?",979516800,11,1559,4.579136690647482

Not only does Ben Stiller give one of his best performances to date, but Robert De Niro really does an outstanding job in this comedy as well.  Jay Roach gives us this zany comedy about a male nurse wanting to prepose to his long time girlfriend but before doing so he must meet the parents (De Niro and Blythe Danner).  From there on it's nothing but good old fashioned comedy.  With a fun appearance by Owen Wilson, this movie will definately make you laugh more than a couple of times.

1284138,5,B00003CXO1,"Went to see the film last week in the cinema with a couple of friends of mine.  Ben Stiller played an excellent part, but Robert de Niro carried the whole movie he was magnificent. But I must give Ben Stiller thumbs up along side an actor like de Diro. I am not saying Stiller is Oscar material, but he was better then in most of his movies.  I still haven't desided if I liked de Niro better in this movie or in Analyze This.  Back to the film, some things through out the movie where really predictable example champange for ""MUM"". But the movie kept me in stitches from begining to end.  Absolutly must see movie, even if you don't like de Niro. However I can't see that there are many people that don't like de Niro.

1284139,5,B00003CXO1,"In my mind the two funniest comedians in the world right now are Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller. Meet the Parents is one the funniest movies that I have ever I seen. Next to movies like Planes, Trains and Automobiles and The Full Monty this is right up there as a comedy classic. BUt the great part about Meet the parents is that it's easy to watch this movie over and over again because the comedy is fast paced and full of great energy.",979084800,,434,4.178571428571429
1284240,2,B00003CXO1,"In  *Meet The Parents*, we follow the adventures of one Greg Focker  (if you think that name is hilarious, you're in luck -- it's uttered about 64 times in this movie), who falls in love with the daughter of a former CIA operative  (Robert De Niro)  who's retired in the suburbs.  Marriage is in the air, and so Focker  (Ben Stiller)  goes with his lady-love to her home to Meet The Parents.  As might be expected, things don't go very smoothly.
The movie has a paucity of ideas.  The only good idea seems to be the clash between De Niro's macho CIA agent and his future son-in-law, who finds himself compelled to invent stories about himself due to rabid insecurity.  Curiously, the  ""female""  angle fades into irrelevance in the midst of all this  ""anti""-male-bonding.  For instance, I couldn't tell you the name of the actress who plays Stiller's love-interest -- and rightly so, for attention is scarcely paid to her.  And Blythe Danner, who plays De Niro's wife, is encumbered with a June Cleaver cartoon rather than a fully realized character.  The male-female relationships, particularly De Niro's and Danner's, might have been interesting  (what's it like to be MARRIED to the CIA?), but such a notion was obviously too difficult for the screenwriters to pursue.  Instead, we get relentless father-in-law jokes, and over-the-top ones at that.  It's as if Focker's prospective marriage is merely a set-up to showcase the  (admittedly)  comic mileage gotten from Robert De Niro, with his 30-odd years of tough-guy baggage accompanying him, Versus Ben Stiller, the weasely Gen-X icon.
Thankfully, De Niro and Stiller do a heck of a job, easily shouldering the film's burden.  *Meet The Parents*  features two very funny performances from a pair of actors at the top of their game . . . but there's very little else to recommend this movie.",979084800,3,1844,4.877419354838709
1284241,5,B00003CXO1,"MEET THE PARENTS is billed as the hysterical comedy of the year and the vociferous accolades is justified because of the impeccable acting and the outstanding supporting ensemble. Robert De Niro is at his best in this comedy with his wry humour and irresistible dry wits. Ben Stiller charms as the male paramedic, Greg Focker who embarks on a treacherous ""Meet the Parents"" session when he decides to settle down with Pam (Teri Polo). A series of accidents happen and Greg begins to reconsider his options when her ex-boyfriend played by Owen Wilson stepped in. The whole mess including breaking the urn of De Niro's beloved mother and the reciting of the ""prayer"", breaking the nose of Pam's sister at a volleyball game - makes such a hilarious turn and imaginative gloss to the plot.
However, it is the acting that shines - especially De Niro and Stiller with such perfect comedic timing that they fill up the screen with luminous presence. Never a dull moment, although the slapsticks do occur - ""Puff the Magic Dragon "" and all the cranky jokes on Focker's name - makes it entertaining and accessible yet not crude. The director Jay Roach (AUSTIN POWERS) sits back prudently to watch the two leads steal the show with their effervescent chemistry. Never mind the plot - just watch the two male actors enchant. This is definitely one comedy that is so affable and adorable that it requires no parental guidance.",978739200,18,1414,4.799180327868853
1284242,1,B00003CXO1,"Meet The Parents is aimed at the crowd that likes to see overweight people get hit in the groin on Americas Funniest Home Videos. The jokes are all at the expense of Craig Focker (Stiller). The CIA dad (De Niro) can not let his daughter marry someone without his approval. Focker is already going there for the wedding of his girlfriends sister. The whole trip is meant to be a time where Focker can impress the father and have his blessing. Catastrophy after catastrophy strike, and we are supposed to yuck it up.
The true fact of the matter is that you can only see so many bad things happen to a seemingly good person. This film crams numerous bad things into the story, just to have us laugh at this persons misfortunes. And millions did laugh. This film was supposed to be fun and light hearted. This film may have provoked more laughter if it had went for something more than the cheap laugh. Many of the jokes in the script are based around Focker's last name, and the fact that he is a nurse. Yeah, that is real funny. The man is a nurse. He is helping to save peoples lives, so lets make fun of him. Really intelligent. Just like this film.",978652800,7,1149,4.348837209302325

It just doesn't work for me, although I have to say that all the film, esp. DeNiro was well cast and well acted. Its all too easy to make this film, so why bother.

1284246,3,B00003CXO1,"robert deniro doing comedy. ben stiller. cats. individually, these are not things i'm interested in; together, it's like someone scientifically engineered a film for me to hate, all it's missing is leonardo dicaprio and golf. however, meet the parents is exactly those three things and yet i found myself enjoying it greatly.
the story is fairly simple: greg (stiller) is ready to pop the question to his girlfriend, pam (teri polo), so it's time that he meets the parents. they catch a flight out to long island where the trouble begins for greg as the airline loses his luggage with all of his clothes, etc., plus the engagement ring he'd bought for pam. pretty bad, yes, but it gets much worse.
robert deniro's recent ""comedic"" films include turkeys like analyze this and rocky & bullwinkle, yet here, as the head of the w.a.s.p.-ish byrnes clan and retired ""rare flower salesman"", he's excellent. perhaps it's just that being a fearsome father isn't much of a stretch for deniro -- the only person i can think of who i'd be more intimidated to meet would be harvey keitel -- but he and director jay roach, of the austin powers films, are content to let simple expressions and carry the weight of the humor. stiller, likewise, is great in his role as greg: i actually felt bad for the guy, and i got the feeling that maybe i was the only one, based on all of the laughter at what seemed like inappropriate times: maybe it's a guy thing, akin to when someone gets hit in the crotch. ben stiller as sympathetic character: who would have imagined?
while the film is massively entertaining, it's not without its flaws. the female characters are incredibly thin and seem to only exist for the purpose of pitting deniro and stiller against each other and setting up stiller for a pratfall. i was audibly groaning when pam, for the fourth time or so, said ""oh, i can't believe i didn't tell you about such-and-such. that kind of information would certainly have given you a better chance to fit in with my family!"" like the austin powers films, there was a tendency to rely on the repetition of certain jokes for cheap laughs, e.g. the many, many puns on greg's last name. finally, the ending is far too tidy. [...]
still, meet the parents, if i gave ratings, is a solid three-star flick. there are many laughs to be had and it's paced very well. the interactions between deniro and stiller and deniro and his pet cat are very funny. it's not as good as best in show, which is the best comedy out there as far as i'm concerned, but few blockbuster comedies in recent years deserve their success, e.g. there's something about mary: meet the parents, however, deserves your money and all of the money it has raked in. imagine that.",975974400,,2725,4.6206185567010305

All of the cast members were great and the acting was appropriate to the film, but I guess I felt as though there were many times when it could have been much funnier.  It was a cute, little, no- brainer kind of movie and reminded me of ""Something About Mary"".  If you want to know the plot summary, please read some of the other reviews since they do an excellent job of summarizing.

Things go horribly, however, when DeNiro distrusts goofy Stiller from the beginning and only dislikes him more and more as the movie goes on.  Poor Stiller tries everything to gain his approval, but nothing works, and of course everything turns into a hilarious fiasco.  There are very original and funny moments in the movie, such as DeNiro's obession over his Persian cat, and the lengths Stiller goes to impress him and cover up all the mistakes he makes.

The plot has quite a few lapses, the success of some scenes is questionable, the slapstick factor is overused, but ultimately, if you lower your expectations a notch and loosen up, the experience should be pretty hilarious and refreshing. The airport scenes are my favorite ('bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bombitty bomb'), and Ben Stiller is surprisingly good at times.  I do feel that more humor could've been squeezed out by the writers and the director to make a mediocre comedy into a memorable one.  Oh well...

1284341,5,B00003CXO1,"How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in ""Meet The Parents,"" a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget.  What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all ""Gregs"" that may come a-calling.  Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable.  In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With ""Meet The Parents,"" Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  ""If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown-""  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.  This movie, in fact, may well be the perfect comedy; certainly it is nothing less than a modern-day classic that you do not want to miss.",971827200,5,3997,4.626591230551627
1284342,4,B00003CXO1,"The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro MADE this movie.  De Niro's suspicious and overprotective nature mixed with the fact that Stiller sticks his foot in his mouth every time he opens it makes for some hilarious scenes.  Stiller's character, Greg, goes home to meet his girlfriend's parents (the father played by De Niro).  Stiller plays this character to a T.  His nervousness, his anxiousness to impress, his shyness around the family, all come across as natural.  His sense of timing in delivering his lines is impeccable.  We see some of De Niro's gangster roles in this character, but also a fatherly devotion towards his daughter (and an almost sickening devotion to the family cat!).  Some of the other reviewers have complained about De Niro moving into comedy, but the roles he's had have been great.
A lot of the scenes in this movie were a bit predictable, but the way in which they are played by both Stiller and De Niro give them an all new spin.  And yes, a lot of the scenes are outrageously unbelievable, but, again, the actors make you believe a little bit more.
This movie was not only funny, but a little romantic as well.  If you're in the mood for a good laugh, this is a definite must see.  Not as outrageous as SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, but classic Stiller all the way.",971740800,2,1304,4.606060606060606

Well, let me be the first to tell you that all theses reviews were wrong and De Niro shined in his role as the father. The toilet humor of There's Something About Mary is still present in Meet the Parents--I won't give any of it away since the shock factor is what makes these scenes so hilarious. Ben Stiller is wonderful as Gregory, the misguided yet well-intentioned boyfriend of Jack's daughter. This movie had so many well placed comic moments that I never really stopped laughing. Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller make such a great pair because of the fact that they are such polar opposites. De Niro's paranoia feeds Stiller's own paranoia and makes for a lot of awkward but humorous confrontations. Their misunderstandings range from the hidden meaning of ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" to premarital relations. Mixed in somewhere within the gags and the shock humor is a nice romance story that is somewhat generic but never overshadows Stiller and De Niro's relationship.

Blythe Danner is on board with one of the most incisively funny performances of her career.

1284347,5,B00003CXO1,"Being what this year's comedies have been like (vulgar!), and what we've seen in the trailers (splattered poo, etc.), it's a pleasant surprise that Meet the Parents is actually a sweet family comedy that merely has some raucous scenes as well. Put another way, there's laughs and chuckles here for all tastes.
The story starts off fairly quickly, establishing that Greg Focker (Stiller) wants to marry his girlfriend, Pam (Polo), and that to do that, he has to get permission first. The weekend starts slowly, with her parents seeming just a little quirky at first, until things get worse and worse for Greg. Then, towards the end, the unexpected happens, and the film flexes back again, with everything falling in its place, subplots revolved, and the whole film feels like a complete picture.
The comedy varies between verbal sparring between Stiller and De Niro, and physical comedy (this is all Stiller). Playing over-protective father Jack Byrnes, De Niro hits his comedic stride. You might expect him to play Jack as stereotypically gruff or scary, but what we get instead is a guy who is eternally smiling, which gives him a friendly exterior, while underneath, the gears are turning, turning. Ben Stiller plays the same sort of earnest ""guy in love"" that worked for him in There's Something About Mary. In other words, he alternates between nervous and heartfelt (and nervous). His jumpiness is the very thing that makes De Niro's character so effective; we see Jack through Greg's eyes. Blythe Danner and Teri Polo are both beautiful and charming, but this movie is mostly about the boys. Playing upon a common social setting of much nervousness (boy seeks approval and permission), this is a winning comedy that is sure to do quite well this fall. The PG-13 rating comes partly because much of the ""language humor"" is from the use of Greg's name, ""Focker"" (and another word that I won't spoil)... it treads a thin profanity line, but the script milks it for all its worth. Maybe that joke is played a little thin (as is a running drug joke as well), but overall, the laughs are consistent, and the story is sweet and even old-fashioned in its way (asking permission to get married? That's so... 20th century! 19th century!).
