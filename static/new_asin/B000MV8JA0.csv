8173020,4,B000MV8JA0,"The evening begins on a raised, wooden stage with a reddish brown and turquoise background. You can see large speakers mounted on the back wall on both sides of the platform giving the setting the appearance and feel of a high school gym or YMCA. The stage is unadorned, occupied by approximately 8 to 10 male musicians and singers in white shirts and thin black ties sitting on folding chairs. Their sedentary body language and expressionless faces blend into the already plain background and causes the viewer to wonder if this DVD is worth a watch. The musicians begin to play and the music is good but nothing out of the ordinary, just typical Middle East cabaret. However don't turn off the DVD quite yet. Keep watching, Leila is about to appear on stage.

What sets this night of song, music and dance apart from the masses is the presence of the enchanting and sensual Leila. With a face and figure to rival any super model or actress in the western world, she is unquestionably the most attractive belly dancer I've ever seen. The cameras are expertly positioned to provide a variety of both close-up and mid-range shots of the lovely Leila seductively swaying and gyrating for the appreciative audience. Ah..., was there ever a more perfect blending of grace and beauty?

If you're expecting a lavish production ala Hollywood than this is not the DVD for you.  However if you're a fan of Middle East cabaret, a belly dance aficionado, or more specifically an adoring admirer of Leila than 'Leila - Bint al Belad' is definitely something you'll enjoy over and over again.

My Rating -4 1/2 Stars-.",1177027200,7,1605,4.741935483870968
