8294033,1,B001DLS566,"DVD was out dated. Looked like it was made in the late 70's early 80's. Very, very poor quality. Most of Japan has drastically changed since then. Would like to return but already opened it and watched it. Very unhappy with what the DVD showed.",1462924800,,244,4.444444444444445

8294036,1,B001DLS566,What's with the airline shots??  Too much info on subjects such as sumo wrestlers.  And who cares about seeing the Mrs. and all the idiotic narration!!,1252972800,2,151,4.769230769230769
