Also check out The Trip, The Trip to Italy and Marion & Geoff (a Rob Brydon project). You will need a region free DVD player if you order a Region 2 dvd.

FYI The 2 ""Trips"" come either as a 6 episode series (appx. 180 min.) or edited into a 110 minute film. I find the series more cohesive and comically satisfying.",1426377600,,386,4.133333333333334

8097931,3,B000CD1H6G,"Holy Moses! Is this character really twenty-odd years old? Steve Coogan may not have invented ""cringe-comedy"" but he must be one of its most celebrated exponents in the UK and, in Alan Partridge, he melds the genre with that of mock-reality to create a truly enduring masterpiece...

...or that's what it says on the tin. In retrospect, AP doesn't quite bear up to close scrutiny, in my opinion. Look at an alternative and equally lauded example, for instance - The Office. Ricky Gervaise may not be the first in line for a Subtle and Sensitive Award, but the offices of Wernham-Hogg are, in fact, very artistically painted. The scenes, set pieces and characters all have a strong element of realism to them and it is quite possible to imagine oneself working there and meeting the people. This realism throws the comedic aspects of the various character into much sharper relief. Alan P suffers from many of David Brent's personality defects; he is insensitive, narcisistic and hugely aware of his own underappreciated talents, but the manifestation of these traits is far less subtle. The situations he finds himself in, his behaviour and his treatment of people around him stray far beyond what is believable and into an almost surreal, slapstick parallel universe and I found the comedy much more forced as a consequence.

There's no doubt that Alan Partridge IS funny and becomes more so in the later Radio Norwich series. The problem is that, in viewing the three series back-to-back, this comedy starts to wear a little thin. The first series, KMKYWAP (or ""Kumkyuwap"" as Alan likes to call it) is the shakiest, consisting of seven episodes (including the Xmas special) of his TV chat-show in which he welcomes, abuses, humiliates (and ultimately shoots) his guests. ""Shaky"" because the chat-show format is extremely restrictive and also because his weekly guests are, for the most part, played by just two co-stars (Rebecca Front and Patrick Marber).

The next two series ""I'm Alan Partridge"" open things up considerably by letting him out of the TV studio and providing him with a much wider and more diverse list of supporting characters. Thus we are introduced to his reformed alcoholic co-host on the Norfolk Nights radio show, Dave Clifton (Phil Cornwell), his PA Lynn (the excellent Felicity Montagu), the slightly damaged Geordie, Michael (another wonderful and understated performance from Simon Greenall) and, in the second series, Alan's manic Ukranian girlfriend Sonja (Amelia Bullimore). The comedy is still deeply-rooted in slapstick, but the move from the TV studio and into the ""real world"" makes more room for this comedy style. There are some classic scenes, including Alan's encounter with his number one fan, his chocolate mousse sex session with Julia Deakin and the live KMKYWAP Show at the Linford Travel Tavern (cringes don't come any more intense than that).

The set is a re-boxing of the two-disk releases of each of the three series and so includes a bewildering plethora extras, including mini-episodes, out-takes, deleted scenes, photo galleries, radio spots and so-on.

Yes it's classic BBC comedy, but it has been improved on and it is starting to show its age.",1379462400,3,3199,5.074144486692015
