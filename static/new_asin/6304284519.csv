8175006,5,6304284519,"My grandson saw the performance of one of the songs on this tape on Sprout TV. For reasons unknown to me, he thought it was hilarious and couldn't understand why I couldn't just replay it for him. Being a doting grandmother, I went through every listing of Barney videos (hundreds!) until I found this one, which was the most likely candidate, although I couldn't be sure since the song titles aren't listed. I wish it had been a DVD instead of a VHS tape, but it was a good guess, it was here, and he loves it as much the 99th time as he did the first. (I still don't get it!)",1289779200,,577,4.160714285714286
8175007,4,6304284519,"A nice story-line with a lot of involvement from Baby-Bop and BJ.  Not as great as Barney's Circus or others but, still a nice and colorful video.  My 1 1/2 yr. old loves it.  A great training tool for the senses - eyes, ears, nose, etc.",1005091200,2,237,4.108695652173913
8175008,5,6304284519,"Fret not, my co-parents.  Here is an interesting way to teach your short-attentioned toddlers the 5 senses.  Lots of nice kiddie songs, very colorful, very entertaining.  My daughter has been watching this for the nth straight day & she has not grown tired of it.  I even sometimes find myself humming the Barney song. :-)",1001894400,5,322,4.8
8175009,5,6304284519,"This is an all time favorite at our house.  My 18 month old loves to watch Barney and rock to the music of the catchy songs. My older children and husband think Barney's sweetness is nauseating, but the little ones love him! The reason this particular Barney video is a favorite to the whole family, including my husband, 16 year old son, and 10 year old daughter, is because after the kids in the video experience popcorn, the snack that you can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch, they go into the theater to watch the video they have made.  Well, Bouncing Barney bangs his head on the door top entrance on his way in.  My husband picked up on this after our little one had watched it for the zillionth time.  Now the older kids have to show all their friends when they come over.  It's fast forwarded and rewound to that part over and over again!  Most people probably wouldn't pick up on it, but once you know it's there it's hilarious!  At least we have fun at our house watching it.  All in all, it's one more fun learning experience for the little ones.",973900800,4,1060,4.345177664974619
