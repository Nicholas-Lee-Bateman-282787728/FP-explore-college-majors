4831396,5,B005M0R524,"Finally a complete boxset of the UNCUT versions of Downton Abbey series 1 and 2 THATS RIGHT UNCUT!!! Hence the Complete Collection on the Box! This does not include the Christmas special but, that is not a part of series 2 anyways... its its own separate entity... after watching the ""cut"" PBS Masterpiece editions that claim to be uncut and ARE NOT (also the editing of the PBS versions is terrible! very choppy!) and then watching this set I can now say I am glad I ponied up the extra money to buy this set... if you thought there was something wrong with the versions you watched and that there was something missing, you would be right! There is more footage across the whole series and it really makes it more amazing than I had already thought it was! I would compare it to the Lord of the Rings movies... The theatrical releases where obviously good but when the studios released the extended editions it was INCREDIBLE! That's this box set! It's the way it was meant to be seen! I call it Uncut, but for those of you who fell in love with the series on your local PBS station, you will be in for a real treat when you buy the ""extended"" editions! I hope you enjoy this series as much as I have! Enjoy!",1331510400,268,1210,4.334801762114537
4831397,1,B005M0R524,"This Blu-ray should be titled The Incomplete Collection. While the quality was outstanding the marketing as complete  is false advertising. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. It is a complete disappointment to me. When I buy something titled complete I expect it to be as advertised. This is a rob job.

The title reads Downton Abbey Series 1 and 2 Complete. At least the copy I got reads as such.",1330992000,41,384,4.632352941176471

4831399,2,B005M0R524,"Buy a different set! This one is not complete - season 2 is missing the last episode, Christmas Special! Unfortunately, the publisher failed to provide any info that the last episode is not included in this set . . .
Also - these is no information on the set box, the dvd boxes, nor on the discs themselves what episodes are in what box, and on each disc! We are talking some 14 episodes, plus extras . . . It would be helpful!
I suggest buy other sets, and check the list of episodes included! If there is one to check . . . :)
Otherwise - I'm still a big fan of the series. Not of the team that marketed this item though!",1328486400,222,623,4.032258064516129

Both seasons are unwatchable...the discs will not play; they stick and stop repeatedly.  Other seasons that I bought from other sellers play just fine, and I believe that these are badly made bootleg copies; I can't think of any other reason that 6 separate discs would all have the same problem, but none from other sellers.

4831581,3,B005M0R524,"""Downton Abbey"" is certainly an attractive-looking series boasting a find cast of actors, including the great Maggie Smith.  I got though the first one and a half seasons and then, unfortunately, began to lose interest in it for reasons of credibility.  I fear some of the writers of this series had not done their homework regarding the time in which the story is set and I began to pick up a few anachronisms, here and there.

This first glaring error I noticed was the case of the cook, Mrs. Patmore, I believe, who is portrayed as being stricken with cataracts.  Lord Grantham takes a personal interest in her plight and sees to it that she will be treated by one of the best  specialists of the day.  She is portrayed is having been successfully treated for the malady and, for a short time thereafter, is shown wearing a small pair of spectacles and later is shown as not needing any glasses at all.  The fact is, that while it was certainly possible to surgically remove cataracts at that time, the insertion of replacement lenses was still decades away.  The aftermath of her surgery would have required her to wear large, thick glasses to be able to see reasonably well for the rest of her life as was the case with my own Grandmother.

In another scene I heard Lord Grantham make the remark that a certain character, ""..... has enough on his plate just now.""  I believe that is a fairly modern expression -- one that I never heard even twenty or so years ago.  At the time being represented, I would have expected the expression  to be ""...has enough on his mind just now"" or something similar.

Also,  Lord Grantham is portrayed as being a goodhearted and kind gentlemen with notably liberal or progressive politics for a man of his time and position.  For him to show concern or personal interest for members of his serving staff would have been, at best, atypical for that time.  It is more likely that all orders to the members of the serving staff would have been communicated by means of the head butler, Mr. Carson, probably the only member of the serving staff with whom Lord Grantham would personally communicate other than his personal man-servant.  Most members of the lower level serving staff were regarded as not fit to even be seen by members of an aristocratic family.  .

A more realistic portrayal of such a relationship can be seen in the film ""The Remains of the Day,"" a favorite film of mine.  In that story, the relationship between Lord Darlington and his head butler portrayed by Anthony Hopkins is rather more realistically represented.  Lord Darlington is portrayed as having some disdain for the lower classes and the Jews and some sympathies with the policies of the Third Reich -- not completely uncommon in England in the 1930s.  It was believed by some  British aristocrats, but of course not by all, that Adolph Hitler had the right ideas for maintaining order in his country.",1392422400,,2918,4.65625
4831582,5,B005M0R524,"It is the best show on TV that I have seen in a long time! Feeling-good, therapy like and so captivating.

I read some reviews here stating that the Christmas Special was missing from this set, but then I was reassured by another review that said the Special was indeed present, but it just wasn't labeled as such.

(SPOILER ALERT) In the Season 2 Christmas Special, some major events take place:  Mary breaks her engagement to Carlisle, Bates is convicted of murder, and Sybil is expecting a child.

This set of discs ends before these events, so the Christmas Special is DEFINITELY missing.

People stuck with trying to preserve a way of life that is quickly passing them by.  Performances by Maggie Smith and others just epitomize what acting should be.

4831762,5,B005M0R524,"There is no other show on television that plays with our emotions and moods as successfully as Downton Abbey. The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more! If you are the kind of person who has time on their hands, any Downton Abbey disc should come with a disclaimer: Do NOT watch unless you want to get hopelessly addicted!

Sure it's a wee bit soapy, and some scenes border on the melodramatic and the sentimental, but heck, who cares? That's the entire reason it succeeds; it's pure unadultered escapism entertainment. Well that and Downton Abbey's superb cast, led by the impeccable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugh-Bonneville/dp/B008FWHK1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugh Bonneville</a>&nbsp;and the great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elizabeth-McGovern/dp/B00170I7AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elizabeth McGovern</a>, with the incomparable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maggie-Smith/dp/B005UG542S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maggie Smith</a>&nbsp;giving a fiery supporting lead, with Dan Stevens, Brendan Coyle, and Michelle Dockery rounding out the talented main cast.

Add to that excellent cinematography, rich costumes, beautiful sets and scenery, and authentic dialogue, and you have the makings of a fine show indeed. But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.

Here's to much Downtonian delight in the future! 4.5 Stars!",1378857600,,2277,6.109375

4831986,4,B005M0R524,"As a Brit living in America I am always proud when British shows make their way over the pond and become popular (in Downton's case, VERY popular). Another one of my favourites that has become extremely popular is Top Gear (shown on BBC America over here). With regard to Downton  it truly is a wonderful show. While in college I lived quite close to the estate where Downton is filmed (Highclere Castle) and had the pleasure to visit it once on my way back home for Easter break. This show does a wonderful job of encapsulating the beautiful house and grounds and is the next best thing to actually being there.

While I loved both seasons, I do have to say that I preferred the first season. The second season has excellent aspects such as how different people in the household deal with World War I and it's devastating effects for all walks of life in Great Britain at that time, and the changing face of the country with regard to the aristocracy's stranglehold on power beginning to ebb away. The acting in both seasons is excellent. However, in my opinion all the great parts of the show are a little ruined in the second season with the somewhat sensationalist storylines which reminded me more of a soap opera than a high-quality period drama like Downton (the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5). This, however, is only a small gripe. Overall a wonderful show which encapsulates aristocratic life in England at that time well (although not perfectly). My American wife loved it and can't wait to take her to Highclere when we go over there.",1374710400,,1550,4.592057761732852

After the first 3 episodes of season one I knew that I wanted them in my own library!  I have since ordered season three...ahemm.  I love how the characters develop and interact.  There is a lot of interesting situations and mystery, secrets and human emotion.  Now, it is British and a period film at that so you have to have an appreciation for the dry sense of humor and the way the language was at that time.  Some of the phrases we've looked up online just to see if they really are actual phrases and sure enough, our favorite is ""squiffy"".  Love it!  The characters are all very wonderful from the angelic to one of the darkest, meanest portrayals.  I think you'll really enjoy it!",1374451200,,805,4.421768707482993

The whole production, thus far has been a wonderful series, yet a emotional rollercoaster. ;) I would have to say the first two seasons where the best. The end of season one recapping a beautiful love story between Lady Mary and Matthew.  The series is not dull, nor dry at all. Taking a family living during the Edwardian period, but with such a fresh take on the screenplay writing. Adding the wonderful costumes and amazing soundtrack and you have a award winning series.  My favorite character is the Grandmother, Lady Grantham! :)",1365465600,,571,4.816326530612245

I was telling my mom and best friend about this and neither of them have Amazon Prime.  I ordered this DVD set for my mom and she had hours of entertainment from them. Not only did she watch them, she shared them with her sisters (my aunts) who are now hooked on the program as well.

I loved them, they were exactly as depicted and the only problem is that I watched them much too fast and had to order Season three as soon as  I finished the first two. The interplay between the servants and the Crawley family is eye opening, especially for the watcher unfamiliar with the edwardian era. It is a time gone by that none of us here in the States have memory of. Stilted manners, with the behind the scenes subterfuge shines a beacon on what may have been the glaring hypocrisies of the landed gentry of that time.

I had heard so much about Downton Abbey but thinking it only a soap opera had chosen not to watch it even though I normally loved PBS and most British or Canadian TV fare.  Finally, my sister and others urged me to give a try, but by that time the 3rd season was ending on PBS, so I decided to order seasons 1, 2, & 3 and watch from the beginning.  My sister and friends were right, I loved it.  It is a soap opera of sorts, but done a beautiful way, not only are the characters interesting but they are interwoven with real history and we are able to get a knowledgeable and informative glance at the past.  We see the passions, difficulties, and beauty of differing political and changing ideologies that infect some and inhibit others as it pertains to an ever-changing world and those caught in it.  The cast of actors are superb, it feels as if I am not watching actors acting like real characters, but watching real people in real situations, their loves, lives, hurts, pain, suffering, weaknesses and strengths.  Without going into the story, all I can say is to those who love to watch great programs should watch Downton Abbey.  It is a masterpiece and it is only right that it should be presented on ""Masterpiece Theatre""......once again, Kudo's to the Brits.",1363910400,,1565,4.60431654676259

4832457,5,B005M0R524,"Dowager Countess (to Lady Isobel Crawley) ""You are quite wonderful, the way you see room for improvement wherever you look. I never knew such reforming zeal."" Lady Isobel Crawley: ""I take that as a compliment."" (turns and walks in the other direction) Dowager Countess: [laughs] ""I must have said it wrong."" My all time favorite British period drama!  Beginning two years before the Great War, with the sinking of the Titanic, these first two seasons span the years 1912-1918 through the end of WW I. The series is set in the fictional Downton Abbey, a Yorkshire country house, the seat of the Earl and Countess of Grantham; and follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants during the reign of King George V. There is almost equal treatment of the Crawley's and their servants...a feature which I believe elevates the film to a much higher level than it would have held otherwise. The two big stars in the series are Hugh Bonneville, as Lord Grantham; and Maggie Smith, as Lord Grantham's mother, the Dowager Countess. They perform superbly, especially Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, with her acerbic wit. The exchange above w/Lady Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) is a case in point...sparks fly when these two are together. But the casting throughout is superb, both for the aristocratic Crawley's and for the servants.

4832462,4,B005M0R524,I am disappointed in the color quality plus the quality of the background where the camera was focused only on the speaker.  In the TV version I could enjoy the quality of the decorations and people who were in the background plus their expressions to what was being said by others.  In these discs the people in the background have black lines across them that are light but visible and it leaves the features of people not in immediate conversation out of focus.  The sound keeps going up and down which requires me to adjust the volume every few minutes.  If mine is a faulty copy I hope I can have it adjusted.  I ordered the third season also and saw the difference in the color quality the rest of the DVD's were good quality.  There was no difference in the credits on the back of the package of season 3 except RALPH LAUREN was also listed as a producer.  Thank you.,1363392000,,874,4.3580246913580245

The people cast just fit the bill to a tee. I don't think anyone does period pieces like the British. The people cast just seem to wear the costumes & look like they were from that era. Not modern types put in clothes. Excellent Masterpiece Theater series once again. The show is so addicting.

4832514,5,B005M0R524,"I am not sure the limited edition set is any different from the two-packs of Season 1 and Season 2 that are sold together. But I opted for this one because I liked what the description said it contained, and I have not been disappointed. The picture and sound quality of the dvd's themselves are superb. Even the open-edged box itself, with the two separate dvd folders inside (one for each season) is attractive on the bookshelf. Of course, the real key is the contents, the Downtown Abbey series itself, every episode of which is absolutely magnificent. The actors portray the characters so wonderfully that you forget they are actors and not Robert, Carson, and the characters great and small who surround them. They make you feel that they are letting you in on their lives and their little secrets, and that you are right there, amongst them all. And that lavish manor house is so visually delightful, as is the country village and all the other trappings, from the costumes, to the cars, to the carts and carriages, to the town's buildings.  It is all so very real.  With every episode you watch you just hate it when it's over, so that you can't help staying up to watch ""just one more.""  We are dreading when the last episode of Season 2 comes to an end.  However, by then I will have purchased season 3, and extended the delights.

I am a huge fan of Jane Austen, and Downtown Abbey reminds me of a 20th century version of Austen-land, with lavishly-developed characters and scenery, twisting plots with a lot of things always going on, but all within the trappings of 100 years later, beginning with the sinking of the Titanic.

So, if you plan to order season 3 separately and just need seasons 1 and 2, this limited edition boxed set for me fills the bill perfectly.",1362960000,,1778,4.5754716981132075

4832516,4,B005M0R524,"Bought this bluray for my wife as a Valentine's gift.  We have enjoyed watching it (have just finished Season 1 so far).  My only complaint is with the picture quality. In some scenes it looks fantastic (especially a sunny outdoor shot), but in many scenes (particularly the less well-lit scenes), the picture is downright fuzzy.  This is especially a problem when we watch it on a big-screen TV (a 65"" plasma).  Disappointing given that bluray is supposed to provide a superior, high def picture.  As some other reviewers have noted, we have resigned ourselves to watching it on a smaller TV instead, where we have not had the same problem with the picture.  From what we have seen of the show itself, we have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would have given it 5 stars, but had to downgrade it by a star for the poor picture quality.",1362960000,,827,4.623287671232877

I was recently channel surfing and I came across the beginning of an episode of Downton Abbey, so I decided to watch it.  After seeing this episode, which was already into season 3, I decided to order the first two seasons.  I ordered the DVD version and the only complaint I have is that the last disc of season 2 had some parts where the disc would stop during some of the scenes towards the middle and end of the last episode.  I don't know if the disc has a defect or perhaps it just needs to be cleaned.  I am now addicted to this show.",1362873600,,706,4.2706766917293235

I loved the series and it seemed fine but recently I watched the same Seasons 1 & 2 on the TV at my sister's in OH and I realized that the discs that I received were incomplete.  I never realized it until I saw the episodes on TV.  I was really disappointed to learn that the discs I paid for were defective.

The only thing I don't' care for is they don't keep real time on the show.  During the 1st show, it is stated that Bates, who started on the first show had now been there two years.  I don't' like the feeling of we missed something.  I wish they would have showed some of Sybil's season, but they skipped right over it never showing them leaving, but already coming back.  And I wish it flowed better between scenes.  Its pretty choppy even with the uncut versions.

The costume design and the locations used for the series are excellent. Unlike The Tudors, where you know who will die when and how, Downton Abbey keeps you guessing as to what will happen next in one of many story lines, though some of the turns are fairly obvious.

The story is very interesting and it moves along well. Some of the situations require a huge leap from reality to accept but that is often true.

The packaging could be improved to make it easier to know what is on each of the DVDs. This comment is meant to apply to both the physical packaging and the DVD menu approach that was used.",1362355200,,500,4.2631578947368425

As the box set credits proudly proclaim it to contain the ""Uncut U.K. Version"", perhaps this last episode (running time of 1:38) was not broadcast as part of the Second Season in the U.K., but as a stand-alone broadcast.

In any event, I returned my box set, as it doesn't make much sense to be completely enthralled in the second season only to have to find the finale on iTunes!

I didn't watch the first 2 years of the show because I was skeptical of those who gave it such over the top reviews. However, after several friends started touting the quality of the show and its performers, I relented and bought all three seasons. I have to admit, I found it hard to stop watching it until I had seen the last and final episode for season 3. Now I can hardly wait for season 4 to be available so that I may continue viewing this quality BBC offing from our distant cousins across the pond. :-), If you are looking for quality programing to distract you from the cares and woes of our current economic crisis and political climate, I highly recommend this program.

I love that both seasons are combined in this slim box. Also includes great special features. As far as these discs being the 'UK version': I watched these online and have rematches the discs and haven't noticed any difference in content. I also watched the last few episodes of season 3 before they aired on TV in the US and then watched them as they aired on PBS and I didn't notice any differences. You're still getting the same brilliant characters and drama-filled plot you're used to. This show is excellent if you're looking for something different. It is unlike anything available on cable television nowadays. It beckons to an extinct time and place where honor was of utmost importance, moral living was the chosen way, and family was everything. If you haven't watched it, just watch one episode. It is well worth it, I can promise you that.",1361836800,,1024,4.601092896174864

How excited we were as we watched several parts in succession unable to stop yet so tired we had to. Our eyes were opened to the ""missing"" pieces that explained why Bates and Barrows had gotten off to such a rocky start. There were many questions answered and hours of laughter and heartbreak all in one sitting. This series draws you into their home and lives in such a way that you can't just stop thinking about was has happened and events to come. One problem we discovered was on occasion the picture frame would pause and hesitate before moving on. This was a minor nuisance but did distract from the professional style. Even with it's minor flaws these DVDs were worth every penny and more! I would recommend this series to families yet advise parents to watch with their children.

I've heard this story line years ago.....  Yes, Yes..... it's coming back......Bob & Ray's wonderful ""Mary Backstage Noble Wife"".

Anyway, I'm pretty upset, especially since the ""Original UK Version"" is exactly the same thing as what was on Netflix.

I did, however, check around everywhere I could think of to find the best available copies. I had seen too many reviews about deleted scenes, the missing Christmas episode, and copies that still contained original commercials!(Incidentally, I've never understood why sellers or whoever would ever delete anything on dvds to be sold, except for commercials, of course. Naturally, I understand why tv would do this when it comes to fitting a movie/documentary, etc. into  a 2 hour time frame, for example.) It was a happy day for me when I saw this version on Amazon. Thank goodness! It was just what I wanted: closed captioning, no deleted scenes, no commercials, and the infamous Christmas episode was included! Furthermore, many extra ""behind the scenes"" parts were also included. If  you're interested in the best version available, this one is a & ""must have""! I, like so many others, couldn't stop watching! Very compelling with amazing characters (Don't even get me started on Maggie Smith), unmatched & beautiful scenery & sets, and a story with plenty of fascinating plot developments.

Even in a movie, I had never seen a formal dinner where the hostess turns the table.  At the Abbey, the Countess turns the table during a formal dinner.  They are also most upset about having to let maids serve in the dinning room.  This is not a female job!",1361491200,,400,4.28

It wasn't until I emailed that I was even told about the region code.  Fine time to let me know.  Even though I'll be refunded the point is this site needs to address this issue.  Wonder how many others had this same problem.  Am disappointed in Amazon and the company who sent it.  One of you should do something about this!",1361318400,,586,4.078947368421052

All of the aspects of a changing society and the effects of those changes are included making the series one to thoroughly enjoy.

I watched it on CBS when it aired (thank you CBS for the quality you put on air, what a change from other stations!) but the advantage with a DVD is that you can rewind when you missed some of the dialogue. As I am french speaking from Canada, sometimes some of it escapes me. And there are also the subtitles who help a lot.

This show & the characters are fantastic, it leaves you wanting more, which made me make this purchase of Season 1 & Season 2.  I am glad that I re-watched Season 1, because the rental that I had watched, had many scenes cut out of it. After reading some previous reviews, the U.S. version has some cut scenes, so I would highly recommend purchasing the BlueRay UK version. You can't play the UK DVD in our U.S. DVD players. This is a awesome show. This Blueray arrived quickly & in the new condition as stated. I just ordered Season 3 a few days ago, & it also has arrived. You will not be disappointed in this show.

4832832,2,B005M0R524,"I bought this product (ASIN: B008HT4FUW) with great expectations; however, much more than mild disappointment set in soon after I began to view the first disc.  For what was promoted to be a Blu-ray version of the series, portions of the video content were not at all up to snuff -- frequently  lacking the clarity and crispness one would normally see in a true, high quality Blu-ray offering.  Moreover, I am virtually certain this product was substandard, as I had also just purchased the Downton Abbey Season 3 Blu-ray edition (ASIN: B0099Y2MYK), and it played on my BD player without exhibiting any similar video deficiency whatsoever. I contacted Amazon and registered my dissatisfaction, and they first offered a replacement.  They then quickly changed direction and offered a full refund (including return shipping), saying the product was not in stock and that I could re-order at a later time.  I have not made a firm decision about whether or not I will make another purchase of this particular item; what's to say there are not others lurking out there with the same issue?

Further this is not the first time, I have encountered problems with Amazon-promoted video products.  Last year I order a set of ""Little Dorrit"" Blu-ray discs (ASIN:003QP2TYQ), which the Amazon web site clearly stated were playable in ""All Regions.""  When I received the discs and attempted to play them on my BD player, I got nothing but a black screen, i.e., they would not play.  When I contacted Amazon about this product, they ran and hid behind the seller (it was an Amazon Marketplace transaction) and never did Amazon honor their ""full satisfaction guarantee.""  When I contacted the vendor, they told me the discs were playable only in Region B (which does not include the US).  Accordingly, the UK-based marketplace vendor took the product back and refunded the just the price of the product. I had to bear the return shipping costs in full (nearly $10.00 (US)) and Amazon never did make good on its promise to reimburse me for return shipping in the event the vendor did not.

Needless to say, I am more than a bit reluctant about ordering products from Amazon.  I feel one cannot take their representations at face value, and one cannot be sure that problems encountered will be consistently remedied to the buyer's full satisfaction.  Regrettably, Amazon did not handle customer satisfaction this shabbily in the past.",1360800000,,2416,4.933333333333334

I'm almost obsessed with this series, as are a lot of us these days, and i can't recommend it enough.",1360540800,,254,4.478260869565218

Yes, it is a soap opera, but the acting is on par with an "" A "" movie.  Once you start watching you will be hooked.  The beautiful landscapes, excellent dialogue, and - Maggie Smith,  create a series that cannot be missed.  Indulge yourself in this period drama, even if you think it will not be ""your thing"",  You will enjoy if you enjoy quality television. Period!!",1360540800,,492,4.586206896551724

4832867,5,B005M0R524,"Excellent view of the roles played by the aristocracy and their servants in early 20th Century England.  Add to this the elements of romance, plots to undermine others and the resulting vindictive behavior, a glimpse as to how WWI and the economy started the change in social structures, and enough comedy to bring on hearty laughs. The acting is superior.  Do not buy this unless you want to be ""hooked."" I have zero financial or social gain by making this review.",1360540800,,465,4.728395061728395

Then I saw that I could buy the entire season  1 & 2 on Amazon for a low price.
As soon as I received the DVDs, I had a Downton Abbey marathon, and was thoroughly hooked.
The DVDs also have some extras which added to the enjoyment of the series - such as the fact that the actresses even wear the type of corsetts for that period and have all had a corsett failure at some time.",1360454400,,463,4.032608695652174

4832888,5,B005M0R524,Have enjoyed it just as much as when we watched it the first time.  Had to get it to gear up for airing of season 3 (which we are loving)! The only complaint is the covers nor the dvd menus give any type of title for each episode so it is hard to remember what chapter you are on by just a disc and number.  But other than that this was great.,1360368000,,343,3.75

4832895,3,B005M0R524,Just received season 3 in the mail. In hindsight the quality of this particular blu-ray is poor. It is somewhat dark and grainy.

I bought this set because I missed Seasons 1 & 2 and wanted to catch up before watching Season 3 on TV.  I only gave it four stars because the discs were slightly problematic.  The first disc stopped playing part way through and I had to fiddle around with it.  The rest were okay for me.  I loaned the discs to a friend so she too could catch up and she had some problems with the other discs but then cleaned them and they were okay.  I don't know why they would need cleaning being brand new and not being handled with dirty hands.  If the discs hadn't been a problem I would have rated this set five stars.",1360281600,,733,4.260869565217392

The setting where the story takes place are extremely well done and seem to be authentic.  The costumes worn by the actors also seem authentic, and often make one wish that we were living back in the era when these clothes were worn.

Looking forward to Season 3 on TV! Though I hate that the season is over in the UK whereas it only started in the US. We are prone to spoiler alerts and temptation to browse through Wikipedia.",1360022400,,458,4.204545454545454

After my daughter told me I might like Downton Abbey I bought season I and II in order to catch up since season III was just starting on TV.  Also bought an extra DVD player and updated the DVR so I could watch in my sitting room without disturbing hubby.  He insisted I should view it on the big living room TV saying ""it wouldn't bother him"".  Well, he got hooked immediately and is now an avid follower and we both watch it on the living room TV.  Surprised the heck out of me as he usually doesn't care for British shows because of the accents which his older ears have trouble understanding.",1359849600,,687,4.3700787401574805

The picture on the third disk was not clear and defined. The picture had a blue tint to it. Poor quality. I sent the set back and ordered the original set through PBS - Masterpiece Theater. I will never order anything from Amazon again, except dog training books.

I believe there are  counterfeiters who list their products with Amazon.",1359504000,,569,4.25

4833084,4,B005M0R524,"This is a fabulous period piece with compelling characters and an interesting plot, highly recommend this for anyone.  However, I am disappointed in the production quality of the blu-ray dvds, at least the ones I received.  There seems to be a problem with frames skipping, so the video at times lurches.  I find it distracting, though others don't seem to notice it as much as I do.  At first, I thought I had a problem with my Panasonic player, but other blu-ray DVD's do not exhibit any issues.  Also, the audio is nothing special, and it does not skip.  I have a 7.1 high-end sound system, and some soundtracks on other DVDs are amazing, but in this case, somewhat ordinary.

I found using the DVDs a great way to do this as I could switch back if I missed some dialogue or didn't understand something.  I had planned to purchase these DVDs from another company for $65.

There wasn't any extra noticeble material in the UK version vs the US TV version as far as my wife and I could tell.  However, the Blu-ray HD quality was great, and made watching all those episodes even better.

As far as the show, Downton Abbey, is concerned, I love the way the show covers historical events and shows how they affect the people of that time.  The interplay between the classes is interesting too!  Having grown up in Britain it's interesting to see what events and traditions shaped the British culture.

I also love how history is woven in, whether it be the Titanic or the war, you get a real feeling of the times they are living in, I mean, who can comprehend waiting for a newspaper boy these days to get news a day later.

4833160,2,B005M0R524,"First off, this isn't a review for the TV show. Anyone with a brain knows that the show is a solid 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. My review is for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-particular/dp/B008HT4FUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this particular</a>&nbsp;DVD set.

The pro is that you can get all of series 1 and 2 as well as the Christmas Special for one low price. There are a few select extras without any commentaries and that is about all.

I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, or if all are made the same way, but I was exceptionally disappointed as I watched the show. All of series 1 and parts of series 2 have serious color issues. Everyone's faces look so pale and sickly with red splotches all over their skin. It looks like everyone has the measles.

Now I will admit that I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/new-blu-ray-player/dp/B006U1YVZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">new blu-ray player</a>&nbsp;(which I love). However, I do not have this problem with other blu-ray discs. On the other hand, I have a very limited number of blu-ray discs since I'm just now getting into the blu-ray world.

I'm reminded of the quality of the Pride and Prejudice DVD set that I bought as soon as it was first released on regular DVD (post the VHS world). It too had color wash out issues.

Also, I am so disappointed in the lack of blu-ray features in this set. For Christmas, my husband bought me&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-set/dp/B008DCAG9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this set</a>&nbsp;along with the new blu-ray player. Maybe it was a bad set to start with, but it has such interesting features! One clever one is saving your favorite parts of the films. My assumption was that this was a standard, but perhaps not. Either way, I wish that a series so great as this one would have taken the time to infuse rich features like the Hitchcock set.

It's worth noting too that if you purchase the separate series blu-rays (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B004FM2ENU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B005Q1W0ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>), you'll likely (at present in any case) get a complimentary digital copy of the series via Amazon's Video Library. I actually bought them first, then cancelled those in lieu of this set. I'm very much regretting that decision now. This set does NOT come with a free video library copy.

All in all, I'm gravely disappointed. Because it is a blu-ray I expected quality HD and that was what I did not get. The final disc worked fine, but not the others. Well, you get what you pay for, I guess.",1359072000,6,2841,5.718009478672986

What more could you ask for? Everyone always thinks about what a romantic time period it was in the early 1900s.......yes.....for the wealthy. Downton Abbey points out what life was like for the people who had to work for a living, as well as the wealthy. And even though the ""help"" in Downton Abbey worked very hard, they also had lives, dreams, and fun as well.
And, like in every place of employment, you have lots of gossip to keep life interesting! (Who CAN you trust?!!) Downton Abbey makes me want to sit and sip tea, and pretend I'm a lady......I want Season 3 for my Birthday!",1358985600,,757,4.414285714285715

The upstairs, downstairs effect has been a hit before and is again, and you are equally drawn to both, but perhaps slightly more to the downstairs, where people can show their emotions more. You come to love the locale, with its magnificent cedars of Lebanon gracing the property, and the house, as they say, is a character in itself.  This is a great showpiece for some good acting from both tried and true personages of stage and film as well as newer, younger break-outs.

4833312,5,B005M0R524,"I need not add my voice to the chorus about the writing, acting, scenery and cinematography - all excellent.  However, the blu - ray discs ""stutter"" slightly, every 5 seconds or so, in my blu- ray player (which is an excellent Panasonic with all upgrades downloaded).  What I mean by ""stutter"" is that the scene jumps ever so slightly at short, regular intervals.  It is not that obtrusive, but it is one of those things that once you notice it, you can choose to ignore it or let it drive you crazy.

I don't know whether this is because this version was originally British and got this defect while being trasferred to US - playable form, or whether it is unique to my set of discs, or some other reason.  I know that my TV can be adjusted to try to fix this, but I have not tried that yet.  Based on the reviews here, at least a couple of others are having playability issues.

I agree with all those who say this is a glorified, high cost-costume soap opera, stories that go no where or resolve a little too neatly and characters who are just too internally consistent.

The visuals owe a lot to Mad Men and the advent of high definition screens.

We are allowed to have a guilty pleasure.",1357948800,,442,4.544303797468355

Anyway this DVD set is alright, it looks nice and works well. However it seems that the first season is not HD while the second is.

In today's world of casual attire, drive-through fast food meals, and simpler life-styles, the viewer is amazed at the importance given to proper dress (and having another person to dress the members of the upstairs family), the etiquette of dining, and the elegence of the dining table.

All this, plus a cast of brilliant actors who capture our hearts all while they amuse and/or irritate us.

It is hardly filled with great acting - obviously sets and costumes are 'spot on', but do I really care if Mary and Matthew get together or not?  I am much more interested in the driver and the daughter and whether Mr. Bates get free or not ............. but only up to a point!  We have been driven NUTS here about this show thanks to PBS who have shown it, reshown it and shown it again in order to build up the audience for Series 3, which was aired last night ..... yawn!

The first half of the first season is a little slow as you meet the characters and all the back stories are set, all of which is necessary.  After that, you can't stop watching!

4833470,4,B005M0R524,"The general consensus seems to be that the first series of Downtown Abbey is a marvelous British period drama but the second run dipped in quality and turned into a soap opera. While there is some truth in that view, it overlooks one key thing not just about Downtown Abbey but also British period dramas in general. Most of the beloved costume dramas from the UK have a strong streak of soap opera in them.

This is as true of programs based on books like Brideshead Revisted and Poldark as it is of the show that Downtown Abbey most resembles - the original Upstairs Downstairs. It's also just as true of the first series of Downtown Abbey meaning that, while there was a distinct dip in quality between the first and second series, it would be a mistake to attribute it to the show suddenly becoming a soap opera. The real culprit seemed to be a lack of focus on the part of the writer, weaving in so many plot threads that not only was it was sometimes unclear which ones we should care about some of those we clearly are meant to focus on felt rushed such as the problems encountered by Mr. Bates late in the series.

Despite that, you have to give credit to the actors for continuing to approach even the more preposterous plot lines with conviction. This is most apparent with Brendan Coyle as Mr. Bates whose dignified performance is a stark contrast with the sensationalistic storyline he's been given. Coyle also starkly contrasts with Maggie Smith as the Countess, whose role has largely degenerated into throwing out pretentiously pithy comments every so often whether the story calls for it or not.

With the third series of Downtown Abbey premiering on PBS tonight, too long after its UK run for most American fans, the biggest question is not what will happen to Bates but rather whether it will be more like the first or the second. Whichever turns out to be the case, the new series is sure to have one thing in common with the previous ones, it will be the classiest soap opera on TV, and that's not a bad thing.",1357430400,2,2030,4.510869565217392

4833481,5,B005M0R524,I have watched Masterpiece and PBS for many years so that I can enjoy the British productions that many years ago were not easily availble in the US or at least not in my area. I believe the popularity of Downtown Abbey is partially due to a desire to return to a more elegant or civilized way of life. By this I mean a return to manners in treatment of others.  It shows that it is possible to express disapproval without rudeness as Maggie Smith's character does so wonderfully.,1357344000,,480,4.393258426966292

We loved the costumes, the humor, the stinging ""wit"",  traditions and the locale.  Many years ago my husband and I enjoyed Brideshead Revisited on PBS and eventually I went on a BBC tour enabling me to visit Castle Howard, York, etc.  So Downton Abbey was especially wonderful for me.
