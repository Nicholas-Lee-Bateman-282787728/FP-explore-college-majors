6817860,3,B00PLYU410,"As a retired nurse I really thought a lot of the movie tells ""it like it is"". The scenes where a Code is in progress was realistic enough. The explanation about DNR status was real enough. Then it began to go a little ""out there"".  It has already been mentioned  that the main character is hooked on drugs. What amazed me were the scenes where  two other nurses at different times  had a drug to offer this guy. Please, who  wrote the screenplay,Nurse Jackie?  While it is true enough that you will find nurses  who abuse drugs, it has not been my experience to see nurses offering drugs to each other to ""relax"" a little while on the job especially.",1430524800,7,650,4.366666666666666

Floyd (Danny Glover) forces Kayle to instruct newbie Amanda (Casey Fitzgerald) who finished top in her class. Amanda discovers that things are more rigorous than expected.

It ask the question, what would you do if it was one of your love one suffering from a terminal illness. I could understand the doctor's decision in certain cases. It's a movie that touch on a very important issue people need to think about and discuss with family members at some point and time.",1435363200,,399,4.405405405405405

6817985,5,B00PLYU410,"Thought provoking.  At what point do we allow people to suffer until the very end against their wishes?  We have seen it over and over again where the patient says DNR/DNI and the family decides to override the patient's wishes and prolong their misery with feeding tubes and artificial means simply because they cannot bear to see them go, and the eventuality is still there.  They increase their own misery right along with the terminal loved one's agony.",1434758400,,457,4.833333333333333
6817986,3,B00PLYU410,"I'm a Danny Glover fan, so of course his acting was good.  The story was o.k. and the mercy killings were considered a grey area since the story portrays the killings as an act of kindness.  In real life, sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't.  Personally, I believe that when a patient is in agony with no hope for recovery it should be their choice and their choice alone to have a drug administered by a physician that would put an end their suffering.  The process of death can be a very inhumane and torturous journey; why make it any worse than it already is.

The movie could have been better since their was the potential for a hard hitting drama.  I gave it a three.",1434499200,5,682,4.330708661417323

6817993,4,B00PLYU410,"I enjoyed this movie. I found it to be a fairly accurate portrayal of ER politics..... Specifically, the very personal struggle, for nurses and doctors alike, facing the reality of quality of life for patients and their families, who must sometimes make end of life decisions at a moments notice. If you have ever been faced with this kind of situation as a family, or as a medical professional, you too might find this movie interesting. It is a bit ""old school"" with regard to technology, but the basic principles apply.",1434067200,2,522,4.747252747252747

What Kayle did however was take matters into his own hands based on his own ethical beliefs and that is wrong. For example when the mother did want her daughter resuscitated, then that is her right. She is the child's mother! The child is a minor despite what the child told Kayle. No-one has the right to play God. Thou shalt not kill.
