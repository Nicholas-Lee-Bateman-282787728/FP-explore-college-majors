8210443,5,B000TRILDM,Loved it.  Great work and large compilation.,1522195200,,44,5.285714285714286
8210444,5,B000TRILDM,Real photos of flying saucers.  Daytime photos up close and personal.  Great info! The world needs to see this information.,1382140800,,123,5.1
8210445,1,B000TRILDM,"You won't be seeing this one on television anytime soon, real garage sale material. This presentation would be stretching it by calling it amateur. Nothing more than a video slide show of drawings and fuzzy photos. No real evidence, only hear-say presented. No movie footage. You never even see the narrator. I actually timed one of the images on screen time at over two minutes. I have also considered returning this dvd, however I think I'll keep it as a reminder to use my money more wisely.",1223251200,2,494,4.689655172413793
8210446,1,B000TRILDM,I think not. A better title would be The World's Worst UFO/Flying Saucer Documentary. For the first few minutes I thought I was watching the genre's answer to 'Reefer Madness'. For the first time ever I considered returning a DVD and asking for my money back. This thing wasn't worth the effort.,1202428800,3,295,4.6923076923076925
8210447,3,B000TRILDM,"They did a good job talking about the pictures they showed. There were not very many photos reviewed, and way too short for the money that this movie costs.",1200873600,2,156,4.413793103448276
