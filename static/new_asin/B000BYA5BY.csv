8094110,5,B000BYA5BY,"Watching these races is great because one can see the evolution of supercross in terms of track design, the machinery, as well as how the riders respond to the media. I watch 1 to 3 races while I ride my Schwinn AirDye. Gets me psyched for racing/riding this spring.",1393200000,,266,4.448979591836735
8094111,5,B000BYA5BY,The amount of watch time is huge. Picture is better quality than the first time I watch the event on tv back in 86.,1365033600,,115,3.8333333333333335
8094112,3,B000BYA5BY,"Nice to have.. If one wants to enjoy the old races.. However the choices of races is a bit of a let down.. 3-4 races were a must have.. Such as Anaheim 86, LA 86 & 87.. but that's it.. Some races posted on YouTube would have been a better pick in this DVD.. And yeah.. Do not expect much interviews of riders of that era..  Too much time was given to the heat races..",1280620800,,367,3.8933333333333335
