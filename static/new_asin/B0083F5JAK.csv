5124659,4,B0083F5JAK,"This movie reminds me of jay and silent bob meets shaun of the dead but very very VERY low budget. If you like d! ck and fart jokes and cheesy movies, you will like this one! its pretty cheesy but it get you laughing. And how can you complain when your a prime member and its free right?",1383004800,,287,3.9655172413793105
5124660,2,B0083F5JAK,"Between the fact it seemed like the entire cast was the same five guys and the really annoyingly bad prosthetic job on the characters (in particular the texas guy's chin).. it is less traditional B-rate style action and more.. a couple of guys got bored and made a move with crap in their garages and around their neighbors. Not really much of a zombie flick either. Small groups of poorly gyrating, spooge-flinging 'zombie-like' people does not a zombie horde make. Now.. that scathing bit aside.. it does have a fair bit of slapstick humor and a few well-placed one liners that made the crappiness bearable enough to give it a mostly-watched-through effort.",1371686400,2,659,4.892857142857143
5124661,1,B0083F5JAK,Do not waste your time on this movie. It's so bad like really really bad. If you do ignore my advice and end up watching this movie just remember these word: I told you so.,1368489600,,172,3.942857142857143
5124662,5,B0083F5JAK,I love this book like the others because its a guy take on the vampire theme.  It seems most of the vampire books of today are chick-lit which is fine but not all of them if all of  them are.  Its refreshing to have an average guy as the hero.  Thanks for creating this character.,1368144000,,280,4.036363636363636
5124663,4,B0083F5JAK,"I am used to indie and very low budget, so was not expecting much from this film.  I was cracking up the whole time...there is a lot of subtle weirdness, bad acting (ina funny way!), dumb jokes but surprisingly good makeup and effects .. sound track is pretty nice  .. its stonerish.  I think anyone who has attempted to make films and is into zombie type of aesthetic will find some enjoyment here.",1360281600,,399,4.438356164383562
5124664,2,B0083F5JAK,"Mourning Wood has gotten some really positive reviews on horror websites. After watching the movie, I think the reviewers who liked it must be on drugs. It is a very stupid movie with only a couple of funny moments. Very little gore, too. I'd say to avoid this even if you like Lloyd Kaufman's Troma movies. This makes his movies look like masterpieces in comparison.",1354838400,,367,4.661538461538462
5124665,1,B0083F5JAK,"Wow,What a STRANGE TRIP(ed,) this flick was,OUCH !

Totally bizarre comedy premise about unusual products that may turn users into zombies.
These jokers are hoping you are drunk when renting films or high...

Some of the comedy bits would work for all TROMA fare.

Hey,It (film) was amusing,if not ingratiating to fans of low humor and bathroom/bedroom antics by college pranksters.",1342310400,2,382,5.229508196721311

8524509,1,B0083F5JAK,"The reviewer in the movie itself at 1:09 said it best, ""That was the most god-awful piece of bulls*** that I have ever seen."" By the length of the credits it looks like this film actually had a budget. It appears that they were actually trying to make a legitimate horror film. There is better material on YouTube that was shot on cell phones by preteens. I really like low-budget zombie flicks but it is good when the cast and the producers make an attempt at putting out something worth watching no matter how silly the plot. There was simply no effort put into making this.",1420675200,,576,4.443396226415095

8524512,1,B0083F5JAK,Don't bother with this campy piece of trash.  Absolutely no redeeming qualities to it.  I wouldn't have bothered if it hadn't been free...now I feel like I lost a few IQ points for having watched it.,1396137600,,199,4.5
8524513,1,B0083F5JAK,"SPOILERS - It's not a zombie movie

The story is weak. They start off with a narrated beginning, and it pretty much goes down hill from there. It felt like a bunch of college kids had to do a class project and they started winging it as they went along. The acting and script are just painful to experience. I kept watching it, expecting it couldn't get worse, and it just did, constantly

Mad scientist makes and tries to sell shampoo on TV. The person he uses it on in the commercial gets sick and starts throwing up. Anyone who gets thrown up on gets sick and becomes a vector for the disease. Being sick consists of stumbling around like a drunk while projectile vomiting more green slime than humanly possible. Mad scientist gets infected, cures himself off screen. Then gives main characters silly weapons, that could only exist in a comic book world out, including a death ray gun.

I like low budget B-movies, but this one was just terrible",1393545600,,948,4.5321637426900585
8524514,1,B0083F5JAK,We couldn't even finish this.  We laughed quite a bit at the beginning but then it just seemed to get redundant.  I think most of their budget money was spent on the opening stop motion clip.,1384214400,,191,4.277777777777778
