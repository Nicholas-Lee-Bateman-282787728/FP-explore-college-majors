The ""Alternate World"" series continues with political manipulaions and alliances.  Jinnai, of course, becomes linked with something really evil.
Continuity Notes: El Hazard the ""Alternative World"" is the 3rd El Hazard series. The original ""Magnificent World"" is the best, so start out with that one. The ""Alternative World"" series is continuation of ""Magnificent World"" and is not part of the ""Wanderers"" series.
Cautions: This series is the most adult of any of the El Hazard series. Lots of sexual inuendo like a sitcom, but nothing really happens.",1007856000,4,575,5.117021276595745

The action starts to pick up as the story behind Gilda and the Emperor gets revealed to make the plot twinge into the third and final act.
Although it hasn't got the most exhilarating plot or  most exciting storyline, its got portions with hilarious jokes and gags  that can make you laugh your way through the entire series.
This is one  of the ""Tenchi"" like series I really enjoy and would  recomend.
On a technical note:
The video quality is crisp and beutiful.  It was only during the opening sequence that I could notice any  pixelation.
The Audio is also really good with clear dialog and solid  sound effects.",960768000,3,641,4.619469026548672
