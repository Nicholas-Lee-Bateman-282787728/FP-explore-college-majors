Some amazing clips that I have not seen before -- which is unusual -- I have watched a ton of them.  Great insight into the life of luxury that was lived in Berchtesgaden while the rest of Europe was suffering in unthinkable ways.

Also an insight into what is happening currently in our own political arena.  Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.  Hitler rose to power in total defiance of the Versailles treaty of WWI.  Instead of confronting him with his series of egregious violations, Britain and France responded in quiet acquiescence.  The US was totally indifferent.  Before they knew it, Hitler and his legions were out of control.

It is not any different than what is happening in the US now under Obama in May, 2012.  He repeatedly tramples on the US Constitution and violates personal freedoms of all Americans, yet Congress also responds in quiet acquiescence.  The list of Obama's transgressions is long, and we would be wise to wake up and demand that he uphold the US Constitution as he pledged to do rather than to trample on it as he has.  Our nation is in grave danger.

Again, a great film on Hitler's rise to power and some of his daily activities.  Evil was alive and well in Nazi Germany. We will do wise to learn from history.",1336176000,10,1466,4.5
8200285,1,B000REWYX0,"I'm intrigued by war history, especially obscure factual documentaries. This is such a product of it's time it doesn't hold up well to modern standards and is not insightful at all - hokey narration and odd punctuation, coupled with poor audio = very hard to watch.",1330646400,,265,4.782608695652174
8200286,1,B000REWYX0,"I foolishly bought this DVD on ""The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler"" expecting it to be an upgrade over the version I had already.  It runs about 1 hour and was produced in 1958.  Moreover, it carries factual errors that anyone familiar with the subject will quickly recognize and would not run on my Philips #711 DVD player.  I had to use my more modern player that will run -R DVD's to view this piece.

""The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler"" also was a segment of the 4-part documentary, ""World War II, the German Front.""  I got the latter VERY CHEAPLY ($1) at a local retailer.  I believe it's available from Amazon.com for $1-$2.

In short, this DVD on ""The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler"" has not been re-mastered or corrected nor is it any great improvement over the cheap DVD noted above.  In fact, the latter has what appears to be original newsreel coverage on the Nuremberg Trials, making it the far better purchase.  Also included in the 4-part DVD are propaganda pieces on ""Prelude to War"" and ""The Nazi Strike,"" by Frank Capra.  As historical references these are also worth viewing.  Total running time for the 4-part DVD is 205 minutes.

I can't recommend this DVD on ""The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler,"" as there are better, less expensive choices available, like the 4-part DVD I keep touting and ""Hitler in Colour,"" narrated by Brian Cox.  The latter is a truly outstanding British production for around $7-8.",1215993600,10,1418,4.646586345381526
