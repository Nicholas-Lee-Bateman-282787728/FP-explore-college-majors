8286476,5,B001CB96O2,"I first saw this movie several years ago, late at night during a layover in Canada.  I never knew the name of this movie but I held onto the story and names of the characters because it touched my spirit and encouraged my heart.  I love LOVE. I've always believed in love and loyalty although I haven't had hardly any experience with either.  I first had to let Christ Jesus show me how to love and be loyal to myself.  We all have to learn this before we can expect love and loyalty from anyone we let into our life.  This movie is one of my all time favorites because it was part of the catapult that led me to stay true to myself and not accept anything less.  Patience is our only true challenge but is not in vain. I love the passionate acting and I love the amazing writing and directing in this movie.  Thank you so much for finding it.",1352160000,,843,4.134969325153374
