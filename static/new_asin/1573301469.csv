The video of her first concert is heart-stopping.  I hope and pray that this  lovely young girl stays as sweet and unspoiled as she seems to be now, and  that her magnificent voice never changes.",931824000,,326,4.366666666666666
191940,5,1573301469,"I cannot believe that a 12 year old can sing like that!  It held me in a zombie-like trance and when it was over, I couldn't stop thinking about THAT VOICE!  My only gripe is that she needed better composure when  speaking to the audience and her red suit was HIDEOUS!!!  Who picked the  poor girl's clothes???",930441600,,310,4.368421052631579

191988,5,1573301469,"When Voice Of An Angel came out, people wondered just who Charlotte Church was.  Despite being an ace singer, through it all, she was also a schoolgirl in Cardiff, Wales who has homework like everyone else, but who happens to be very talented and with some famous friends.  Oh yes, and with more stuffed animals than I've had hot meals--(OK, maybe not that much, but you get the idea).
Her televised concert at the Brixon Academy in London on 2-3 March 1999 is a visual triumph in terms of the red, blue, and yellow lighting that flash during her performance, and her red jacket and trousers outfit is a smart and stylish.  The kid in her is there, as she puts two of her stuffed animals, a large white bear and a goofy-looking spider, as a kind of security and moral support.  Given her performance in the concert, they should be paid overtime.  Though not listed on the video box, here are the songs played in order.  All but one are taken from her debut album.
1) Panis Angelicus
Charlotte gets help from the London Symphony Chorus on this Cesar Francke composition.
2) The Lord's Prayer
Yes, this is the ""Our father, who art in heaven"" done in song, and she has to ask the conductor who wrote it, to which he responds Albert Lamotte.
3) Mae Hiraeth yu y Mor (There's Longing In The Sea)
In that song, the lights fan out behind her, giving her an angelic penumbra, and with her singing, she does have a voice of an angel.
4) In Trutina
5) Pie Jesu
In her signature tune, she gets a guy her age, Gwillem Evans, to duet with her, and he does an admirable job, and has a good voice to match.
6) Danny Boy
7) My Lagan Love
Again, the same penumbra lighting effect is done, making this a highlight.
8) Suo-Gan
9)Y Gylfinir (The Curlew)
10) When At Night I Go To Sleep
11) Men Of Harlech
This is a climactic closing highlight, as it features the Welsh Male Voice Choir, smartly decked out in red tuxes, singing a stirring, traditional Welsh song.
Those who have Voice Of An Angel who want to program their CD in order of the concert, follow this sequence:  2, 4, 15, 3, 1, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17.  Then program her eponymous CD for track 16.
After the concert, there's a behind the scenes prequel of the week before the concert, including interviews with Charlotte, her family, vocal coach, Sony Music rep, manager, leading up to rehearsal at the Brixon Academy.
A stunning concert debut and the signs of things yet to come.",1070236800,9,2416,4.401345291479821
191989,1,1573301469,"Charlotte Church's current popularity clearly shows the public's general distaste in classical music.  Any vocal pedagogist or singer, from watching this video, could sit down and write a substantial critique of everything the young Welsh soprano does wrong.
The human voice is a fragile instrument indeed.  Used properly, it can create a beautiful sound.  Used in the manner of the young Miss Church, one will experience general fatigue and laryngitis in extreme cases.
Hopefully, there is a pedagogue out there who can correct Miss Chruch's vocal issues, and help her to achieve the status that the public places her in.  Otherwise, she will continue to develop techincal problems that will eventually prematurely end her career.",1049500800,5,731,5.3304347826086955
191990,5,1573301469,"Charlotte's voice is even more spectacular when she is singing in concert. And who could not love a singer who introduces her Teddy Bear to the audience? It was so cute and made you realize how young she actually was when she sang at her first solo concert. Here she takes center stage for the first time, makes jokes that the audience loves and declares that various songs are of unknown origin.

She is quite the personality and I had to just laugh when she declared that the Men of Harlech were looking so ""posh"" in their matching suits.

By watching her in concert you will be able to see the contrast between her teenage personality and her angelic and almost adult presence when singing for an audience. It is as if an angelic force pervades her very being. She could be as ancient an angel as one who first sang for God at the beginning of time.

Within her is a beautiful soul which radiates throughout her being when she is on a stage. I noticed how while practicing her songs she seems much more shy, but she comes alive completely onstage. There are times when she does seem under the spell of her own voice.

Not only does Charlotte take on some complex songs for her age, she sings each song as if she has always known these songs. In fact, she started singing at a very young age and has a very musical family. The beauty of her voice has the power to bring
a grown man to tears.

Songs in this Concert which are also from the Voice of an Angel CD include:

Panis Angelicus
The Lord's Prayer
Mae Hiraeth yri y Mor
In Trutina
Pie Jesu
Danny Boy
My Lagan Love
Suo-Gan
Y Gylfinir
When at Night I Go to Sleep

In this DVD, you get to see behind-the-scenes footage and glimpses of her life. Everyone in her life seems to just come alive in a new way when they are around her. It is as if the light in her being also flows to everyone around her.

Of course, she was also a very young Welsh schoolgirl at the time who was known to pout and have disagreements with her mom. She is very human and yet has been blessed with an amazing talent. We forget all about how human she is when hearing her sing her signature tune, Pie Jesu. Especially while surrounded by candles and an amazing orchestral accompaniment. The sheer confidence everyone places in Charlotte was part of what impressed me.

Part of the beauty of her voice is the innocence. She is truly a natural. In a way, it is unfair to compare her to anyone else. She is unique. This is a child who took charge of her own future at a very early age. In this DVD you will see how she actually started her career by her own actions. It is not her mother pushing her, but rather encouraging her to be the best she can be. They show Charlotte and her mother laughing and it does seem they have a very good relationship.

""I was watching Richard and Judy and they said they were looking for talented kids. No one was around so I phoned up."" ""The producers said I had to sing down the phone. So I did 'Pie Jesu,' and that was it. I was invited on the show! Mum and Dad were the last to find out!"" -Charlotte Church

I look forward to seeing her acting in the 2003 release of ""I'll be There,"" which is a comedy. She actually made her acting debut in the UK TV drama 'Heartbeat'.

Charlotte's biggest ambition is to sing in her favorite opera - Madame Butterfly -at La Scala in Milan. You know, this Welsh soprano might just do it one day. After all, she has already had a concert at The Megaron in Athens.

At 17, she has seen so much success. I can only imagine a wonderful future for this motivated young star. She was born Feb. 21, 1986.

191991,5,1573301469,"Charlotte Church is an accomplished young teen who truly reaches audiences of all ages and across all musical spectrums. SONY Music and Public Broadcasting (PBS) accomplished quite a coupe in feting her in such a forum ... and we thank them ! Despite her several years of stardom, visibility and international acclaim, we're embarassed to say it was the PBS broadcast of late that brought her to our attention and made us instant and enduring fans.
Since hearing this 'voice of an angel' six months ago, we cannot travel far nor relax in our home without yearning for the magical sounds of Charlotte's voice ... with apologies to no one, we heartily believe she has a very special, God-given, unique musical touch. A handful may critcally assess the breadth of her classical training or question the maturity of her voice, however we shall be forever grateful for the blessing that is the voice of Charlotte, an accomplished woman whose wonderous voice touches our heart and most assuredly has taken residence there forevermore.",1041120000,5,1028,4.982558139534884
191992,3,1573301469,"'Voice of An Angel' star Charlotte Church has much to learn, but her voice can carry a tune and she sounds very mature for her age. The concert itself was rather tasteful. No slinky outfits, no dancers distracting the audience. No smoke or dramatic screens to show off the young soprano slithering on the dance floor to 'Pie Jesu.' Charlotte has the spark, wit, and personality to pull off the impossible: capturing the audience's full attention with her voice, and performing a wonderful concert presentation. Unfortunately, there are some things I do not like about her voice; it strikes me as nasal at times, like she has a heavy cold. Hopefully, she'll grow out of that.

191993,5,1573301469,"I've just watched this DVD, borrowed from a local library, on my 19"" computer screen. My sound system is not the best but is quite respectable for its undistorted sound and frequency response. This review may not be couched in flowery language, but it is sincere and comes from the heart. Miss Church is everyone's darling -- a daughter, a sister, a schoolmate, a fellow performer -- and maybe in a few years, some very fortunate man's wife. She is professional in her presentations,  yet she is the girl next door -- a well rounded, feisty, clean and lovely teenager with a well disciplined and self determined mind of her own. Her mother and the rest of the family are seemingly very nice people, musical and well educated. Every minute of this presentation was like a breath of fresh air.
  But most important is her voice. For a young operatic soprano she has an amazing resonant quality and very good breath and vocal control. It's true that at times she sounds just a bit pinched, but hopefully that will go away as her voice matures. Overall, she evokes mixed feelings, even tears. How can one so young and pure have such a powerful, clear and yet mellow voice? It is uncanny! Her facial expressions will not let you look away for a second. Her enchanting appeal comes on many levels. And her sacred numbers are worthy to truly glorify our Lord.
  The orchestra, director, choir, staging, her attire, the video and audio production on this disk are all superb. I am purchasing a copy here and now because this will stand as an inimitable benchmark in my DVD library, and I only wish everyone could enjoy this wonderful snapshot in time of Charlotte as I did. If you love music, quality sound and video, you'll be eager to obtain your own copy of this album.
  One last thing: I've been a sound engineer and designed audio equipment, recorded live performances, etc. I've believed all my life that sight and sound must go together to make a full A/V experience. Now, at the age of 65, I've seen this dream fulfilled. THIS IS THE WAY ""AUDIO"" ALBUMS SHOULD BE! I look forward to having many more deserving artists' perfomances  preserved in the DVD medium. It has everything and eventually should be affordable to everyone. CDs have great sound but are only half the event; DVDs have it all.",1006300800,14,2295,4.621621621621622
191994,5,1573301469,Charlotte Church in This Recording will really Touch Your Heart. The music itself on Audio CD or Cassette is Paled Compared with seeing her actually seem to be praying the words out as she sings in concert.

191995,4,1573301469,"It's fun to get to know Charlotte, hearing her cute accent, watching her  sing or go to school, hanging out with her friends, seeing her family, and  getting to know the cute characterisitics of Charlotte.  At the same time,  it's fun to see Charlotte perform in concert and sing your favorite songs.  All of this is found on the video.  One part of it has the concert and the  other part talks about the making of the concert and meets Charlotte in  person.  The concert part has ten songs from the album and was also the  debut of ""Men of Harlech"" from her knew album.  It has many food  musicians and some songs had new arrangements.  I especially enjoyed  ""Suo Gan"" because it was recorded with a Celtic band that  included guitars, accordian, Celtic fiddle, and even uillean pipes(the  irish bagpipe).  The only problem the concert had was it's directing,  because the lights were just too darn bright and sometimes the camera  didn't focus on Charlotte very well.  The second half of the video was also  enjoyable, as it showed Charlotte in person.  This is the best place for  fans to learn about Charlotte, the person and the beautiful voice.

191996,4,1573301469,"I was watching this DVD together together with my five years old boy. The singing of Charlotte (and the young boy) was very impressive indeed. The  orchestra was performing as one could expect - professionally! And the male  choir also performed nicely. The biographical part was partially a bit too  sugary, but the videos by Charlotte were good. In my opinion the audio part  of this DVD was very good indeed, but the visual part was from time to time  overly sugary - this bein by no means Charlotte's fault.",965174400,2,511,4.633333333333334
191997,5,1573301469,"This is a must buy DVD !
Listening to and watching Charlotte Church in her first concert, on a Home Theater system with a good speaker system and a big screen is truely exceptional.
Forget the Internet or digital  games, this DVD may be the single best arguement for the benefits of  digital technology that there is.
The DVD's production does have some  slight flaws though. The audio quality is very good, but there is some  slight rumble at high listening levels. The video seems over driven and  camera angles can be irritating when they hit laser lights (a common  problem)
Now for the thoughtless part. The concert's lighting seems done  by a bunch of confused 10 year olds that think hundreds of spinning and  glaring laser lights and massive ultra violet lights are way cool. Reality  is that it all just detracts from Charlotte's presence.
Luckily,  Charlotte's young voice and personality do overcome the childish  lighting.
On a one to five scale, this DVD is still a 10!",959040000,7,982,4.7514792899408285

I got goosebunps the first time I saw/heard it,and 6 months  later,it still knocks me out.

I have had the fortune to travel and hear many of the greatest singers of the 20th century and none can compare with the voice of this young lady from  Wales.

She handled every song exceptionally well, bringing emotion that is hardly to be looked for in a twelve year old to each one.

When he starts raving about something I know that it is either the cheesiest thing, and I best stay away from it, or it is something truly great. I mean back in the 70s Mark knew that Tommy James was more than just bubblegum music. I didn't know anyone like that except myself. He had this fantastic stereo and he put on 'Kathleen Macarthur"" and wow! I once played Tracy Chapman's ""Baby Can I Hold You"" and told him, that this was the best music video ever created, and without hesitation he agreed and confessed that he once spent a whole day just playing it over and over, he couldn't turn it off. The point is, years ago when Charlotte Church was all the rage, he came to me and told me I had to see this (her first concert video), and we both agreed that we were looking at something unusual.

She is the essence of youth untouched by the drugs, booze, and sex emulating from today's modern music culture.

7798213,2,1573301469,"Ok folks, I thought I`d just be fair here:
First, I simply can`t understand why there is so many people outthere that are so extremely fond of this signer. Her voice sound very mature for her age, and she looks pretty average, too - at 14 or so, she allready looked like a young woman. While she had a distant (she looked already ruther mature than) foretaste of a child prodigy at her very first debut on this album, she eventually grow out of this status few years later. What could, *could* make her a slight point of interest, was the fact that she allready at 12 attempted to sing professional arias and songs thus being a child prodigy, is now no more. She growed up, and being in her 17`s, she doesn`t look like a child anylonger. Her voice and especially her technique, however, seem to be unchanged and that is, in my opinion, one of her gratest disadvantages up to date. Without a slightest exaggeration, her voice have a great portion of terrible shrillness, often forced and nasal notes, that are mostly harsh and unpleasant to the ear. While it`s true that it have some sort of mysterious freshness and purety about it, though ruther distant, it is at the same time obvious that her technique seem incomplete, her style outdated and weard - her voice, with few and infrequent notes of beauty and melowness, is mostly violently penetrating and uneven. It`s enourmous luminosity and harshness is striking to the extreme - and it gives more pain to the ears, ruther than satisfaction. To summoraze it all, I want to conclude saying that while I find the voice of Charlotte Church to be ruther curious and beautiful, at the same time, I find her technique poor at best and terrible in general - if she doesn`t change her technique, she may never have a right to claim that she sings in a true classic style. No way.
Cheers.",1072137600,8,1832,4.554545454545455
7798214,5,1573301469,"I absolutely adore Charlotte Church.  However much some people belittle her talent or claim she is being manipulated by people who are going to ruin her voice, she is a star of stars in my eyes.  She truly does have the voice of an angel; it's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.  This DVD is a special treat indeed because it allows us to hear and see Charlotte at the very beginning of her professional career.  She had already topped the classical charts with her debut album, and now, mere days after her thirteenth birthday, she gave her first true concert, backed up by the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus - and we can all be there time and again with the 5000 or so fans physically in attendance that night.  The music is fantastic, Charlotte is as charming as she can be, and an inside look at her life at home and her preparation for the concert show us a perfectly normal child who just happens to have a magical voice.
After a short introductory piece, Charlotte walks out on stage with no sign of nerves whatsoever.  She brings a couple of friends with her, a white stuffed bear and a shaking critter whom she likens to her Dad before the show (as he was obviously more nervous than Charlotte was about her big night).  Every trace of the adorable little child disappears once she stands before the mike, though.  She leads off with Panis Angelicus, and the transformation from excited youngster to world-class soprano is amazing; while Charlotte always shows her love for what she does, she also reveals her serious commitment to each song in her whole demeanor.  After each song, her youthful nature shines forth in smiles and laughs, but her seriousness never relents until the orchestra plays the final note of each song.  She sings eleven songs in all in this concert performance, ten of which come from her Voice of an Angel CD, backed up by a huge orchestra and sizeable chorus.  Her delivery of The Lord's Prayer is impeccable and soul-stirring, even more so in the light of the attack on 9/11 and another singer's moving rendition of the song during the national memorial service following the tragedy.  Danny Boy is also a beautiful song; Charlotte's version of this song is respectfully somber but not quite as mournful as most renditions I have heard.
The Welsh songs are particularly lovely, possessing a nature that really draws me into each song even though I have no idea what Charlotte is singing about.  My Lagan Love, Suo-Gan, and Y Gylfinir (The Curlew) - one of the Three Welsh Bird Songs from her debut album - are quite magical.  Her friend Gwilym Evans joins her for two songs: Charlotte's signature song Pie Jesu and When at Night I Go to Sleep; his high voice blends well with Charlotte's, but he appears far more nervous than Charlotte was.  Charlotte's final song of the evening closes the night out in grand, exciting style, as the London Welsh Male Voice Choir joins her in a stirring rendition of Men of Harlech (the one song here that you won't find on her debut CD).
The concert is fairly short, but it is followed by a wonderful look at the real Charlotte Church.  We get visions of both her family and school life, showing Charlotte trying to juggle homework in between interviews for television, newspapers, and magazines from all over the world.  She and her mother look to have a loving and fun relationship, and Charlotte is as proud of her family as they are of her.  The little girl in her is clear to see, as evidenced by a huge stuffed animal collection and her innocent zest for life, and it is reinforced by her mother's descriptions of her sulking prowess.  Charlotte is refreshingly normal and down-to-earth, and she makes it clear that she is singing and performing because that is what she loves and wants to do forever; in no way is anyone manipulating her into doing anything she doesn't want to do.
The Voice of an Angel DVD is essentially Charlotte Church's coming-out party; she had proved to the world that she could sing like an angel, and with this concert she proved that she could perform in front of a large audience and not only blow the audience away with a voice of the rarest beauty but also display all the charms and poise of a true star while doing it.  I don't see how anyone could watch this DVD and not love Charlotte Church.",1070323200,13,4318,4.590377113133941
