8133715,5,B000GOIFMU,"One of the best Hindi movies ever made. Many social issues of the time are addressed some are true even today. Portrays life and social/moral issues in a village where the landowner  is judged by the  village's  moral  codes.

Shabana Azmi gives a great performance in her debut film.

English subtitles added to understanding the film better for me. Highly recommended.",1414195200,,370,4.983606557377049
8133716,5,B000GOIFMU,"Let me just start by saying that I avoided so-called ""parallel cinema"" for the longest time because I was always led to believe that it was boring compared to mainstream Hindi films (I am a non-Indian).  I have now seen a handful of films from the parallel industry (mostly starring Smita Patil and Shabana Azmi, two queens of acting if there ever were) and I have to refute this.  Ankur in particular is riveting, despite being what you might call slow paced, because unlike typical Bollywood movies it knows the story it wants to tell, the thoughts it wants to provoke, and it doesn't veer from this course at all.  The setting is so different from what I'm used to when I watch Indian movies.  To me this realism is more fascinating than seeing people jet-set from Bombay to London to Paris. When characters and situations feel authentic, it's easy to get engrossed by the story because you feel like you are watching reality and in a way, you are.  Anyway, Shabana Azmi is simply stellar in this film and she looks gorgeous.  In terms of her acting in Ankur, there are few to equal her from any era or genre of Indian cinema.  Anant Nag and the other two lead actors are also excellent.  I loved this film and I'm really glad I bought it because I will definitely want to watch it again.",1374451200,,1291,4.463829787234043
8133717,5,B000GOIFMU,"One of the classics from the Director who created/defined alternate cinema in India.  Highly recommended for those who appreciate ""middle cinema"".",1357430400,,146,5.9523809523809526
8133718,5,B000GOIFMU,"Very moving and powerful look at both the caste system and the treatment of women as objects
in rural India, in the early 1950s.

A young woman from the serf class is taken in and slowly seduced by her arrogant, handsome
young ""master"" whose house she keeps.  But when she becomes pregnant, and his promised child
bride finally becomes old enough to join him in the house, our heroine is slowly, painfully pushed
aside and locked out.

The film is occasionally heavy handed in its politics, but the truth behind the story makes the
slightly agit-prop nature forgivable.

This has none of the singing, dancing and theatrics we have come to associate with modern
Indian cinema.  This harkens back to the stark, quiet realism of Satyajit Ray, with complex
characters and surprising subtlety.

NB: I haven't seen this specific DVD release, so I can't comment as to its quality.",1326931200,,873,4.825503355704698
