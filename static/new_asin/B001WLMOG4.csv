3827062,5,B001WLMOG4,"Having seen this film upon its original U.S. release I have come to realize that its beauty, power, and whit have not deminished over the years. About ten years ago I decided to take a university film class for the fun of it. THE SEVENTH SEAL was one of the films shown. As the final tests were being conducted I heard one of the assistent teachers complaining that almost every student had chosen to write their final paper on this particular film. WOW! The film had not lost its ability to reach an audience with the passing of time.
  I have enjoyed the Criterion DVD release for many years and became very excited at the release of this title in the Blu-ray format. The transfer is flawless in both picture and sound. The exciting thing about Blu-ray is that studios are renewing their efforts to upgrade their films and are now improving upon fine DVD releases. Black & White films like CASABLANCA, THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK and Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL can now be experienced as if you were seeing original release prints shown under the best conditions (if you are watching them on good monitor).
  The big surprise on this Blu-ray release is the wonderful 83 minute documentary BERGMAN'S ISLAND (2006) which is by far the best I have ever seen for understanding Ingmar Bergman and his approach to life. The Peter Cowie material (both the repeated and new) are outstanding. All of the extras enrich the experience of this film.
  I would say that this release ranks as one of Criterion's very finest efforts -- now I can hope that they'll do the same for the recently restored British classic of THE RED SHOES!",1245542400,4,1617,4.616724738675958

3827066,5,B001WLMOG4,"What can be said about this film that has not already been said, or written?  It is sacred in the temple of cinema.  The knight's confession to Death alone is inexhaustible.  I used it to open a philosophy essay on Schelling, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche.  And I got an A.  But enough about my writing skills.  Bergman is a genius.  He is an artist.  He is a philosopher.  His angst over the silence of God is an extension of continental/German philosophy which began with Martin Luther, if you ask me.  But this is the sort of film that philosophers and people who are interested in the deepest human ponderings will not only want to see, but own, so they can watch it over and over again.  It is the kind of film that should be cultivated over a lifetime.  Every time I watch this film, I come away with something new, even if it is only that Bengt Ekerot bears a striking resemblance to Dwight Eisenhower, who was President of the United States at the time this film was made (1957), and I got that from the excellent essay included in the DVD, written by Gary Giddens.

I do think the film is just a bit overhyped, especially compared with other Bergman films, but that does not take away from the fact that the Seventh Seal is still a highly enjoyable film.

3827091,5,B001WLMOG4,"What more could I possibly say about one of cinema's greatest films?  Ingmar Bergman spins a tale of a disillusioned knight who encounters Death after coming home from the crusades.  This film is magnificent.  One of my favorites.  It's poetic and haunting, full of fantastic visuals (besides the iconic image of Antonius and Death playing Chess, there's the religious imagery and the fresco of the Dance of Death).

Everything in this film works.  Wonderful performances from Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bjrnstrand, as well as countless other Bergman regulars and non-regulars.  I won't try to give you a play by play because this movie is too famous for that.  If you're reading this review you're already interested and only looking for information on the product.

Criterion has put together an excellent product, improving on their previous release from years ago (Spine #11, early days of DVD releases).  Not only is Peter Cowie's familar commentary included, but also a new afterword from him.  There's two Bergman related releases this time around: an introduction filmed by Marie Nyrerod and a longer, 80+ minute documentary about his life also filmed by Marie Nyrerod.  There's also audio only interviews with Max von Sydow (conducted by Peter Cowie), Bergman 101 about his filmography from Cowie as well and a short appreciation by Woody Allen.  The trailer is also included.

If you're on the fence about upgrading, jump off and pick this up.  Improved picture and audio, plus a boatload of new and excellent features.  You can't go wrong with this package.",1426464000,7,1566,5.05859375

I found the performances, cinematography and pace of the film to be superb. I was stunned by the amount of humor in this film, there were various parts that were very, very funny. This movie will most certainly be remembered as one of the best films of the 20th century.

There is a contemplative tone throughout the film that brings to question the meaning of life and death.

Some join them is their travels,  It's filmed in black and White, which is used to great effect to create a strange landscape that adds to the presence of Death following after the knight and his friends.  The Criterion version looks great and restores the movie to is original state.  There are few extras on the DVD, an Interview with Bergman that lasts about 2 minutes is interesting.  It is in Swedish and you need to read subtitles so if you have a problem with subtitles and don't speak Swedish this movies in not for you.

3827106,5,B001WLMOG4,"Like many, I grew up on a diet of 70's and 80's escapism, i.e. Spielberg and Lucas.

It was only during my college years that I gravitated towards more challenging international and arthouse cinema. Perhaps also like many, The Seventh Seal served as my gateway. First watch resulted in confusion. Second watch resulted in an almost immediate third watch and binge-viewing of Through a Glass Darkly, The Silence, Winter Light, Persona, Scenes From a Marriage, Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Smiles of a Summer Night, The Virgin Spring, Wild Strawberries and Summer with Monika over the course of an unusually cold Tennessee winter. I loved most of them, but I can always, always go back to The Seventh Seal.

Criterion's blu-ray package is one of their best. It's an obvious essential for Bergman fans, but it's also a perfect place to start with Criterion films in general - I would argue that it's one of the more accessible films in their catalog. I won't blather on about how wonderful and important the film is (I'd recommend Peter Cowie's stellar, informative commentary for that), but I will say it's a lot funnier than people give it credit for and I found myself laughing out loud at the scene with Skat hiding in a tree from Death. The film is also one of the most beautiful specimens of black and white photography I've ever seen or will probably ever see, one of many reasons why you owe it to yourself to upgrade to blu-ray if you haven't already. Seriously, the print is gorgeous. Sometimes I'll just have it on in the background with the sound off, like a moving art piece hanging on the wall.

The reasons above make it a recommended purchase, but the supplements are what really elevates this package above the rest. You have the aforementioned Cowie commentary, which is more informative than the Development of Cinema course I took my sophomore year in college.

You have a trimmed-down version of Bergman Island, which is also a wonderful starting point for those interested in Bergman. Like most artists, he keeps you at a distance, but you still gain some insight into the man's personal and professional life. It gets a little dry at times, but how rare to get so much facetime with a filmmaker of his status. Bergman 101 serves as a great primer to the man's career, though it does contain a few mild spoilers for some of his films, if that sort of thing bothers you. The rest of the supplements are brief but informative - Woody Allen's piece is basically just him talking about how much he likes Bergman's films, but that's not surprising if you've seen Interiors, Love and Death or A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy. To top it off, you have the wonderful, rather thick booklet that comes with it.

Here is one of the best films ever made, looking the best it ever has, paired with a superb set of supplements to dig through. I find it more valuable than the cinema books I had to buy in college, and a lot prettier. If you have the slightest interest in digging a little deeper into cinema, this is the perfect place to start.",1393891200,5,3059,4.636531365313653
3827107,5,B001WLMOG4,"This film presents a dialogue about whether or not life has any meaning at all. One has to watch it many times to see all of the elements of the drama. The picture of the DVD is perfect, even in black and white. Excellent subtitles. If you like writers and thinkers like Kierkegaard, Sartre, Tillich, Jung, and Faulkner, you will enjoy this film. In spite of its heavy theme, it has a very light side. It is most like a medieval play, but with a modern sensibility.",1391385600,3,465,4.35632183908046

Between the wonderful use of lighting, shadows, acting, and themes, all of life is there as we fade into one moment of life to another. If you see one film in your life, this is the one.

3827110,5,B001WLMOG4,"Criterion has outdone themselves once again with this new edition Blu Ray of Bergman's classic film. The Seventh Seal is an absolute must see for any would be student of the cinema and this is the package to see it on.

Max von Sydow plays the iconic knight Antonius Block who has just returned from the Crusades with this loyal squire Jons(Gunnar Bjrnstrand). Both men are  world weary and return to a Sweden being devastated by the plague. In one of the screen's great images Block challenges Death(Bengt Ekerot) to a game of chess. The stakes are high if Block wins he gets to live or at least live long enough to do one noble deed in his life. That deed is the saving of a small family and their child from the death at the hands of the plague.

This is one of the great intellectual films of contemporary cinema but that thought should not put off any potential viewer. The film explores the meaning of life and death and the theory of whether or not God exists in this world.

The Criterion package presents the film in its original Swedish and also in an English dubbed track. The transfer is as perfect as if the film was brand new. But the film itself only hints at the things to come as one explores the disc. First up is an introduction to the film by Bergman hmself. That is followed by an excellent commentary track by Peter Cowie produced for the original Criterion release. To this commentary Cowie has added a brief video afterward of material that he was not able to discuss on the original track.

The biggest special feature is the presentation of Bergman Island (2004) Marie Nyrerod's documentary on the director originally made for Swedish television and then recut as a feature film. This is an impressive extra feature since Criterion has also released the film as one of its stand alone titles. The film runs 85 minutes and covers three aspects of the director's life: his cinema, his life in the theatre and finally his reclusive later years on Faro Island. This feature alone is worth the price charged for the disc.

Wrapping up the disc are a 20 minute interview by Cowie with Von Sydow which was used for research into Cowie's book on the actor. The interview which is audio only speaks to the issue that foreign actors have of breaking into the American film system. There is also a tribute to Bergman by Woody Allen for Turner Classic Movies and the excellent short Bergman 101 also by Peter Cowie which walks the viewer through a large segment of the director's career in about 35 minutes. The original trailer for The Seventh Seal is also included.

This is a must own disc that comes with the highest recommendation.",1382659200,8,2650,4.566315789473684
3827111,5,B001WLMOG4,"Pretty much perfect. Everyone knows that The Seventh Seal is a classic meditation on mortality, art, and love -- what they don't tell you beforehand is that it's also very, very funny. Unlike its parody, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.",1374710400,,231,4.8

I think the ravages of time and imitation have taken their toll on this movie, rendering its most powerful scenes and situations somewhat trite.

3827120,5,B001WLMOG4,"This is a Swedish film written/directed by Ingmar Bergman and set in Sweden during the Black Plague. Antonious Block, a disillusioned medieval knight (Max von Sydow) plays a game of chess with Death who has come to take him as Block is almost back home from the Crusades. If the knight wins, he lives, if not, he and his friends die; at worst, Block will stall death for awhile. Meanwhile, he's frustrated by God failing to show himself, leaving the knight unable to resolve his spiritual quest.

Realizing he's about to lose, Block 'accidentally' knocks the chess pieces over, distracting Death while some escape. Block then returns to his castle and is reunited with his wife; the entire party share one 'last supper' before Death comes for them.

The title refers to a passage about the end of the world from Revelations. Bergman's father was a rector in the Swedish Lutheran Church. The picture conveys a period of 'doom and gloom' centered around penitential piety that was also slightly masochistic.",1359158400,,1005,4.905882352941177

existence (or lack thereof) of both God and the meaning of life more.

I appreciate it, with it's stark, lovely photography, attention to
detail, marvelous performances, and sly dark sense of humor that
balances the portentousness of the subject matter, and makes the film
much easier to watch than my teen film-class memories of it.

On the other hand, while I appreciate the film's importance in cinema
history, and the bravery with which it tackles the biggest of issues in
a head-on, intellectual way, I find it just that - a very intellectual
experience, devoid of much in the way of emotion. I also find some of
the writing painfully preachy and on the nose.

Yet, in the end, I admire what it accomplished in its time, and how
well it holds up 53 years later.

And seeing as I went from not liking it at all, to liking it quite a
bit on my 2nd viewing, I'm open to what a third seeing might bring.

As almost goes without saying, the Criterion blu-ray transfer

3827128,5,B001WLMOG4,"This is the kind of film I watched in my youth, trying to get ""cultured"" and in search of art and knowledge.  Now, as a middle aged man introducing this to my kids, this film completely satisfies:  it has good characters with many layers (my favorite is the tough but just squire), an original and intelligent plot, and unforgettable images.  OK, my kids did not exactly take to it and I finished it alone, but it is part of our library and we will return to it, to be sure.  This is a great classic, one of the truly best and shows what cinema can do.

Returning after 10 of Crusades warfare, exhausted and cynical, a knight encounters death.  He is full of doubt, questions, and some wisdom.  But he needs to see his wife, whom he has missed for 10 years, to find some answers.  So, death agrees to play chess with him, giving him time during the game.  The knight is accompanied by a squire, who metes out justice with roughness and charm and takes on a beautiful servant to accompany them; her is protecting her from a corrupted preacher turned thief, the very one who advocated for them to go to Palestine.  Another family joins them, theatrical artists who are happy, including a visionary husband who sees more than most.  As this group treks through the forest to avoid the plague, the knight continues his game with death.

The conclusion is full of beauty and ambiguity, which I do not want to spoil for the viewer.  It is completely believable, sad, and filled me with wonder for the mystery of life.  Warmly recommended.",1332201600,2,1532,4.503623188405797

3827133,5,B001WLMOG4,"Not every film made is replete with action, adventure, and their consequent joys and sorrows. Bergman's famous film goes where cinema hardly treads these days - it's a meditation on death and the search for meaning between birth and death.
Set in the Middle Ages, during the time of the Christian Crusades against Islam, a knight, played by Max von Sydow, appears on a beach and in the presence of anthropomorphized death. They play an ongoing chess game, which is meant to determine the knight's death. In the several interims, the knight and his squire encounter the best and worst in humankind. The squire is a bit hardboiled during this series of encounters, the knight seemingly hopeful that some sort of knowledge will allow him to see both life and death in some semblance of perspective - a perspective that will engender meaning.

The movie was filmed in the 1950s. By the standards of today's acting, cinematic technology, and storytelling, the minute-by minute progress of the movie seem at times as inane as Gilligan's Island or I Love Lucy. But perhaps this was by Bergman's design - depicting life's inanities as sandwiched between the rigors of birth and the helplessness of death. Still, the movie provokes viewers to a new relationship to both life and death, and that's all to the good.

This particular version of the movie also contains a documentary with Bergman, an interview with von Sydow, and several commentaries. All in all, a worthy testament to cinema as art.",1309910400,,1488,4.900793650793651

This version of ""The Seventh Seal"" firstly comes with an excellent 24-page booklet containing a great essay by Gary Giddins.  The picture quality is excellent having been very, very well restored and while not pristine perfect is still very good to watch and one cannot overstate just how much better black and white films look on 1080p.  The sound quality is also good although personally I would have liked to have had a DTS HD MA lossless 5.1 surround option but perhaps this mono is the best they could do.  The special features are also great with the interviews of Bergman being the standouts.

This is just great film-making from every possible angle of evaluation.  I loved the theme of the film of finding God in the least obvious places and how death comes for all of us and that although we may delay the inevitable we can never cheat it.  Even when Death plays chess with the knight I get the feeling I'm watching a cat playing with a mouse before devouring its prey.  It's interesting how the knight goes through so much trouble and suffering not only for himself but also for his clearly not very happy and yet fiercely loyal squire in doing what others like the corrupted seminarian tell him is the way to please and hence to know God by killing Saracens - the very people who think it pleases God to kill clearly mentally unstable women by burning them at the stake and calling them witches - this very knight is left not knowing God and feeling empty while the lowly relatively innocent and trusting lower class performer Jof not only sees the Virgin Mary and the Infant Christ but he also sees Death and hence is able to run away at least for the present from the fate of the rest.  Interesting how in the Bible the Beatitudes states how blessed the pure in heart are as they will see God explaining God's favour and blessings on the simple Jof and his family as they are spared the fate of the more complex and higher class knight and his squire.  The ""Seventh Seal"" will now also make it to my very short annual classic film viewing list.

3827138,5,B001WLMOG4,"No one does Blu-rays better than Criterion and this Blu-ray of THE SEVENTH SEAL matches their best output.  The struggle for the best art house films usually is between Kino and Criterion and I usually cringe if Kino undertakes a major film instead of Criterion.  Not that all Kino discs are disappointing, but virtually none provide the kind of treatment for the films that Criterion provides.  Take the new Blu-ray of METROPOLIS.  It lacks a commentary track and has only a couple of special features.  Yes, it has a magnificent copy of the restored print, but compared to the British version of METROPOLIS, it is a disappointment.  Granted, Kino editions are usually cheaper than Criterion, but this truly is a case of getting what you pay for.

THE SEVENTH SEAL is Ingmar Bergman's most important film and is perhaps his best.  It is one of the two or three most iconic films of the art house movement and one of the few that has thoroughly penetrated pop culture as a whole.  Although we think of it as a classic today, it was actually a low budget film by a relatively unknown director (although his previous film, SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT won a price at Cannes, he was still not well known around the world - it was only after THE SEVENTH SEAL that he became widely known).  Only a few scenes were shot on location, with virtually the entire film shot either on a stage or on the studio back lot.  The ""forest"" scene was shot among a few trees on the edge of the back lot, with light reflected off nearby apartment buildings.  Gunnar Fischer used an old Mitchell camera (the same kind of pre-WW II camera used by Kazuo Miyagawa on Kurosawa's RASHOMON) to produce some of the most unbelievable images in film history.

What is so exciting about this release is how extraordinary it looks.  As is true with all of the Criterion Blu-ray releases, this looks too good to be true.  I'd seen this a couple of times in college in student film societies, and then later on VHS, and finally on DVD, but I never saw it look this good.  Unless you saw this when it first came out in the fifties, or have already seen the Blu-ray, you most likely have never seen THE SEVENTH SEAL as it looks here.

Just the improved image of the film would justify the cost of the Blu-ray, but it comes with an overflow of special features.  As is so often the case with Criterion, an extra film is thrown in, the series of interviews known as BERGMAN ISLAND is included, along with an add on to Peter Cowie's earlier commentary on the film, which also included with the feature film.  Cowie also provides a Bergman 101 run down of his films, with a bit about his life as well.  I am not sure how helpful the 101 feature would be for someone unfamiliar with Bergman, but it provides a nice refresher for those who already know his work.  There are other features as well, meaning that you not only get the film, but something like a miniature course on it.  In Great Britain there are some very good DVD/Blu-ray releases, in particular by the Eureka! and the British Film Institute, but neither in Great Britain nor in the United States does anyone come close to matching Criterion.

For being filmed in 1957, this was amazing and truly breathtaking.  I won't bore you with the details as included in dozens of other reviews.  I will just point out some of the things I found interesting.

First, the two disc DVD set has a ton of great features, and these are well worth viewing.  Second, the Criterion transfer was great.  I don't think that the Blu-Ray will be able to improve upon it, but the picture is clear and the sound is masterfully restored.  For purists, they might complain that the film lacks some of the roughness of the original (which was filmed with 10-20 year old equipment even then!); but I think that Bergman would approve of the purity and clarity of this version.

The backdrops are dramatic, even more so when realizing 95% was shot in the studio or on the backlot in Solna (with mid rise buildings just behind the trees).  The acting is stellar, and the language really seems to mesh well with the theme and storytelling.

For those who are very religious, I might understand a little hesitancy to watch this; but note that the film never questions religion outright... Bergman makes a point that the film is questioning the 'silence of God'.  Read some reviews, wikipedia, watch the extras, etc... before you make a rash judgement.

This is a film that rewards the view with multiple viewings.  This was one of the original 'art house' films.  Bergman was a film icon and deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as Kurosawa, Fellini, Truffaut, Kubrick and Goddard.

If you enjoy dramatic, intelligent movies from the 50s that eschew the Hollywood norms and take risks; then this is a must see.",1283904000,3,1917,4.577712609970675

3827153,5,B001WLMOG4,"Since first seeing this film in my early 20's, I've considered it the greatest film I've ever seen, and repeated viewings have yet to change that opinion. Having the opportunity to own this on DVD was a treat for myself. To my surprise(I usually do not read contents, basing my purchase on the title itself & price) I was pleasantly surprised to not only recieve this pristine copy of the film, but an extra disc filled with excellent material, including a Woody Allen overview of Bergman films.
(Bergamn is Allen's favorite director, and close viewing of Allen's films often finds homages to Bergman, including Allen's Interiors).There were also several interviews with Bergman himself.

  If you are a Bergman novice, I reccommend this flm as the one to start with. There is plenty of plot action, and the performances are more open and accessible than many more slower paced Bergman films. Every time I watch the movie, I see something new, and while watching this on a recent flight, I realised how well paced the movie actually is.

  Bergman's story centers on a knight & his squire returning, disillusioned, from the long(10 years) and bloody fighting of the Holy Crusades. They return to a Danish countryside wracked by the Black Plague. The knight, awakening on the stony beach, is greeted by Death himself, who , in lieu of taking the Knight, agrees to play chess with the Knight, and delay taking him until their game is finished.

  In their travels, the Knight & his squire run into many characters, creating a small band they travel with towards teh Knight's castle, until's the movie's final confrontation with Death. At a recent party, the host asked over dinner, for every one to name thier favorite film, and why. I picked this one, and it's beacuse there is , literally , everything in this movie. Bergman speaks to Life, Death ,marriage(good and bad) love, lust & hate. He speaks of religion(bad and good) and faith(not the same thing). He adresses war, and peace and how all lives affect others.

  As grim as the film can be, there are many very funny moments as well, and two of the most unforgettable movie characters ever, the Knight & Death. Bergman's Death is often shown and parodied(the end of this film is parodied in Woody Allen's Love & Death, by the way).

  The movie is in black & white(late 50's) and subtitled, which, sadly , puts some people off, but it is , still and always, my favorite movie-I recently re-watched Barry Levinson's ""Diner"" and got a small kick out of watching two of the characters watching the Seventh Seal in a theatre-one character is absorbed, the other talks about going to the beach all the time and never seeing Death there.

3827161,5,B001WLMOG4,"1957 was one of my favorite years for film, and `Det Sjunde Inseglet' is one of the many reasons why.  One of Ingmar Bergman's finest films (and that is saying a lot, since he is one of the greatest directors of all time), `Det Sjunde Inseglet' is a startling glimpse at death and religion and the impact those two very important subjects have on life.  With stunning performances (Gunnar Bjornstrand gives perhaps my favorite supporting male performance of all time) as well as crisp and engrossing black and white photography, `Det Sjunde Inseglet' is nearly as beautiful as it is powerful.

The films core is found on a desolate beach where Antonius Block meets Death and challenges him to a game of chess.

This game represents the game we all play, that of life.  Death is an inevitable end, a course we cannot cheat (for there is no way that Block can actually `beat' Death), but one has the opportunity to give the game their best effort.  Thus, one has the chance to embrace life while they have it.  Block has seen a lot in his lifetime (war and plague to mention just two) and so his faith has begun to waver; his doubts surfacing about God and his concern for humanity.  This theme of religion (or better yet, spirituality) is touched upon in the majority of Bergman's films, but the poignancy and emotional relevance has never been stronger than it is in `Det Sjunde Inseglet'.

I find hesitation in really explaining much more of the film, for it is an experience that one should walk into blind almost.  There is so much to uncover here, but what is so wonderful about filmmakers like Bergman is that they present a message one has to really uncover themselves.  There are many ways to interpret this film, and no which way is really correct.  It all depends on how the film touches and or moves you.  If I really elaborate on my own personal findings it could unfairly influence your interpretation of the film, and so I'll reserve my thoughts on the matter for those who have already developed their own opinions.

So watch the movie!

The acting, like I mentioned, is sublime.  I easily fill my Best Supporting Actor ballot with almost everyone in this film.  Like I mentioned, Bjornstrand is my favorite supporting male performance of all time, so he takes this in a cakewalk; but Bengt Ekerot is extremely effective as Death himself, and Nils Poppe is marvelously entertaining as Jof.  All three are leagues above any other performance that said year; and 1957 is a stunning year in nearly every category (Lead Actress is also jam packed).  I really enjoyed Max von Sydow's detachment here, but he is clearly out-acted by the supporting cast.

I wanted to take a few moments to really expound on my love for Bjornstrand here.  He is utter perfection; quite possibly the most complete supporting performance ever recorded on film.  He is witty, charming, genuine, engaging, stern, desperate, depressed, concerned, focused, heroic, dashing and even a bit scary.  He covers all of the bases with effortless balance and not a single ounce of awkwardness.  He is stunning here, no ifs ands or buts about it.

I am a huge fan of Bergman, and while `Det Sjunde Inseglet' is not my favorite of his films (I reserve that honor for `Scener ur ett Aktenskap') it is certainly one of his finest moments and one of the best films of all time.  At the price listed here it is a steal, so for once you don't have to splurge to experience something special!",1255996800,9,3460,4.649671052631579
3827162,5,B001WLMOG4,"Yes, the BD version definitely delivers.

As for the film itself, most of you probably have seen this film or some of his other work... so I won't comment much on the film, but rather the technical aspects of this film.  I mean, a knight plays chess with Death, what's not to like about that?

Stunning image quality and sound.  It's actually been a while since I've seen an older version, though I think it wasn't even the old Criterion edition.  What I can attest to is that, like ""Repulsion"", the transfer is simply incredible.  There is absolutely no way short of a projection of the film itself that will deliver like this one.  The subtitles appear to have been modified a little, being translated probably better for today's modern age.  The extras are not extensive, but a nice addition to the BD version of the film.  Also included is a nice booklet with the film.  It could be considered a ""collectors"" booklet, as it is nicely put together and informative... but to me it's just something that Criterion added as a bonus.  Very nice, though.

Bergman's exposures and lighting come through so beautifully in every frame.  There are some scenes that come across as ""flat"" but that has nothing to do with the Criterion transfer and was more than likely on the master print itself.  I think this could have been adjusted slightly to get rid of the prominent grays, but it could have been Bergman's intention as well... that I'm not sure about, but it was certainly in the original film.  What's gone from the original is a hissy, poppy audio track and there's not a single hint of dust or scratches anywhere.  Amazing what Criterion has been doing with these old prints!

Keep in mind the aspect ratio is 4:3, (the ratio of what was previously the standard for TVs), not 16:9.  It was common for films of that era to be presented in it's full frame form... if you have a projector setup or large enough widescreen television, don't worry it hardly distracts at all.

Also, you'll be glad to know that Criterion was smart enough to eliminate those ugly blue cases that most BDs are packed in.  They have more specially made cases that are clear and just a couple millimeters deeper (the spine, presumably to make more room for the booklets).  Much more attractive on your DVD case than a row of neon-blue cases.",1249862400,8,2317,4.602439024390244

Rather than artificially reduce the amount of grain, they left it intact to preserve the ""original"" state of the film. It was a bit off-putting at first, but I got used to it quickly, and I think it was absolutely the correct decision.

The film is a marvel from start to finish, and the wide shots in particular are nothing short of beautiful.  The detail you can see in the waves of the ocean or the leaves of the forest is astounding.  The sense of realism and weight that is given to the actors/costumes/settings via the level of detail is truly revelatory as well.  The sound is crisp and clean, although I'm admittedly not a serious audiophile.  Really though, it's the visual brilliance that will stop film nerds in their tracks. This is reference level stuff.

If you are a fan, this version of the film is worth every penny.  I haven't yet delved into the extras, but the fantastic transfer of the feature alone is worth the purchase.",1247184000,7,1287,4.465811965811966

3827167,5,B001WLMOG4,"The film:

Bergman is one of those things. He won't appeal to everyone. It's arty, yes. It's high concept. But really, when you get down to it, many of his movies are not hard to watch at all. This one might be the most accessible. Max Von Sydow plays a crusading knight returning home wearily after a long campaign. With his servant, he encounters a country besieged by plague and despair. Against this backdrop, he encounters Death, whom he challenges to a chess match. Does he want to live forever? No. He wants answers to his soul-chilling skepticism about God and life.

The performances are all very good, especially Von Sydow and Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand as his squire. Dialogue is clipped and spare, but evocative. Sydow has some particularly good scenes in the chapel, confessing his doubts.

Overall, it's easy to see why this film is hailed as a classic. It's deep, but also brief enough and paced well enough to be enjoyable. The ending is a bit cryptic, but not in an off-putting way. It should definitely be viewed by anyone with an open mind for ""world cinema.""

The Blu-Ray:

This is a great transfer. This is what I'm sure we all hoped ""Dr. Strangelove"" would be. There is a fine, regular grain structure which allows us to see terrific detail, especially in foliage, facial features, and cloth textures. Black levels are solid and consistent, so objects in the shadows are always well delineated.

You MUST make sure your gamma and brightness are set well! This is a film in which a lot of stuff can be lost in the shadows - it is very high contrast. In the opening shot, if your display is crushing blacks, the mountains will look like one black blob, when in fact there is a huge amount of detail and shading on rocks. SO: if you do not have a disc like Digital Video Essentials, at the very least pop in a Lucasfilm disc to use the ""THX Calibrator."" It has a contrast/brightness pattern that should get you set right.

Extras include a LONG documentary/interview piece with Bergman in his later life, presented in 1080i. Commentary is provided by a film scholar.

***********

If you are a fan of Bergman or this film, this is a no-brainer. There is detail here you'd never see on a DVD, and the black levels (so important on a b/w film like this) are much deeper and more consistent than any SD presentation could allow. Extras are a nice complement, and for the price, you really can't beat this, especially compared to what Criterion releases cost just a few short years ago.

If you're more of a neophyte to this kind of cinema, you should rent first. See if you like this sort of thing. Don't be daunted by the reputation of this and other Criterion releases. Give it a good honest try. You might be pleasantly surprised.",1246060800,33,2746,4.585714285714285
3827168,5,B001WLMOG4,"It's safe to say that The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's most famous film judging by how firmly entrenched it has become in popular culture over the years. Key images and scenes from it, including Death, the chess game, and the Dance of Death, have been emulated and parodied countless times over the years. On a historical level, it has also been credited with helping launch art-house cinema in the 1950s, along with the films Akira Kurosawa and Federico Fellini. However, this has done little to diminish what a powerful meditation on man's search for purpose in the universe it is.

The first disc starts off with an audio commentary from the previous edition by film scholar Peter Cowie. He briefly talks about the impact that the first time he saw The Seventh Seal had on him. He points out where Bergman drew his inspiration for the look of Death. Cowie populates this track with production anecdotes along with an analysis of what we are watching as well as the film's themes.

""Afterword"" is a follow-up by Cowie to the 1987 commentary he did for the Criterion Collection. He points out the film's rich humor, despite its reputation as a dark, brooding film about death. This extra gives him a chance to mention things that he failed to when he originally recorded the commentary.

""Max von Sydow Audio Interview"" features excerpts of interviews Cowie conducted with the veteran actor in 1988 for a book about the man. He talks about his upbringing and his parents. He recounts his first experience with the theater and how it led to him becoming an actor.

""Woody Allen on Bergman"" features a wonderful short film from Turner Classic Movies with Allen talking about his love for Bergman's films over a montage of clips from them. He says that The Seventh Seal is his favorite Bergman film. This is an eloquent tribute to the man and his films.

Also included is a trailer.

The second disc includes ""Bergman Island,"" an impressive feature-length documentary about Bergman that was released in 2006. Bergman reflects on his life and career, coming across as a modest and humble man who tells all kinds of engaging anecdotes from his life. There are many clips from his films and excellent behind-the-scenes footage.

Finally, there is ""Bergman 101,"" a crash course on the life and career of Bergman by Cowie. He narrates over stills and clips from the man's films. This is an excellent primer that traces Bergman's career arc and touches upon many of his films while also providing factoids and analysis.",1245628800,44,2515,4.821345707656612

I am a USMC Vietnam Combat Veteran and have danced with death seven times while on my tour and came back ""Without a scratch""(just a saying as there were leeches, elephant grass, trillions of mosquitoes). Some around were shot, some stepped on mines, some were hit by flack from artillery, rockets, grenades, mortars, and RPGs. Seven times I was lucky, I mean there must have been at least one Angel involved. Yes I believe in GOD. I will watch(First time, the whole movie) by renting on iTunes as Amazon doesn't have a rent option. I'm not really a B&W person as I am an artist and very much a colorist, but hey I get it. I do have a B&W collection but but mostly comedy like Laurel &Hardy, The Three Stooges, Marx Bothers, Thin Man series(First 4) Abbott & Costello(4 Monster movies) and the first two volumes of The Bowery Boys. I also have the gangsters, Bogart, Cagney and Robinson in about 20 movies. So it's not like I won't watch B&W just the stuff that is very special. I rated this movie prematurely so I could write this. Once I have watched the movie I will ajust accordingly, but it's gotta be at least four stars. Sayonara",1503360000,,1214,4.376106194690266
