8615738,5,B00FH0RGLE,Loved this movie. Love anything Jonathan Rhys Meyers is in. Hes the best actor I know of and can adapt to any part he plays. I had other favorites at one time but I am smitten by him. I watched the movie twice to understand what was going on. A tumultuous relationship only to end in sadness.,1524528000,,292,4.140350877192983
