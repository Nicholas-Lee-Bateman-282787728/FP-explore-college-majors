7736456,4,B01EK44KXE,"I first saw this as a rental and was thinking of adding it to my collection since I did like it a lot when I first viewed it.  Was planning on getting the 3D version once I found it at a decent (read reasonable) price and, even though I don't have a 4K tv, I thought this was a too great a bargain to pass up.  I enjoyed re-watching it in 3D and, if and/or when, I move up to a newer 4K tv, I'll be all set to view this on that one also.  And for those who haven't seen this film, try it out, it's well done and funny.",1524787200,,518,3.6486486486486487
7736457,5,B01EK44KXE,"For the best technical quality and convenience, I use a Zidoo x9s or x10 streamer to play back AngryBirds. 3D.iso rips without any issues whatsoever. In full MVC/1080p resolution on my LG 65"" OLED. Superb! (better than 2K jokes upconverted to 4K)
Here is the BEST source for 3D blu-rays:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/3d-blu-ray-movies-tv/b?ie=UTF8&node=1804651031

I really like the sense of humor in this movie along with the colors. I watch it too frequently!
The 4K HDR is brighter with somewhat more saturated colors. But I'd rather watch in 3D than burn the eyeballs out...

Well, I /think/ it was a ring-tone. The point is, I had no expectations at all before seeing it.
I liked this a lot. The animation is great and the story is ... absurd, which, in this case is a complement.

7736481,1,B01EK44KXE,"Don't buy this version. The case is the flimsiest DVD case I've ever seen and the disc retainer in the center is very grippy. It's almost guaranteed that you'll break the disc when getting it out, especially if it's a child who will get the disc out each time. The only way around this is to set the box on a firm surface and gently ease the disc out. My son tried to get the disc out himself and broke it. Now it won't play and it was his Christmas gift (w/o gift receipt, sadly) so now he doesn't get to watch this movie that he loves. Buy a different version.",1514246400,,562,4.072072072072072

I've played the game, but my husband hasn't, so he came to the movie with no knowledge of what to expect. We both laughed through out the movie and I wasn't expecting that level of humor.

To my surprise, it had a good story and the comedy was well timed & story pacing excellent.  I smiled & laughed.  The movie makers did a good job of keeping the abilities of each bird true to their abilities given in the  game. The King pig and his minions were hilarious.

Great for kids and adults and skews somewhat towards boys. My only wish is that they gave numerous stronger roles to female characters in the movie as that is a huge percentage of their base gaming audience. What a huge mistake for the movie studio!!!  They did not even include Stella as a character in the movie. Get it together Hollywood!!  We need women included in the movie and gaming culture as key rock stars!!",1492732800,2,548,4.6875

7736605,4,B01EK44KXE,"When I first heard that an Angry Birds full length CG animated feature film was in the works years ago, my initial reaction was a common one: how in the world are they going to fill an hour and a halfs worth of screen time based on a game with virtually no story whatsoever?

The answer, it turns out, is very, very easily.  And why not?  Films like Illuminations Minions and DreamWorks Penguins of Madagascar have taught us that rich plots aren't necessary to deliver a couple hours of mindless digital escapism.

Sony, no stranger to proper film-making techniques, took all the right moves with this one: Assemble a cast known for comedic presence and good timing, draw from a witty screenplay that isn't overly simplistic or complex (by Simpsons alum Jon Vitti), keep the visuals bright, cheerful and accessible and the rest will take care of itself.

First-time feature directors Clay Katis and Fergal Reilly, both longtime studio animators with major Disney and Warner Bros. credits to their names were brought on to helm the project for good measure.

Did the efforts pay off?  Considering the film was made on a budget of $73-mil and managed to take in $350-million at the box office alone, that is about as resounding a yes as imaginable.  Given the way Hollywood studios work; these types of profits assure that this will not be the last we hear of CG animated Angry Birds films.

But were here to talk about this one and right from the opening scene, a very Ice Age-esque segment where the films main protagonist Red (Jason Sudeikis) races through a jungle carrying a gluten-free cake while encountering obstacles of endless bodily abuse, it becomes clear that the laughs are going to come quickly and relentlessly.

Red, it turns out, is a party clown for hire and when his would-be customers push his buttons past the breaking point, its off to anger management class for our short-fused hero.  Its here he meets Bomb (Danny McBride) and Chuck, a speedy yellow bird (Josh Gad aka Olaf the Snowman from Frozen).  Thus unlikely trios time spent reforming is short lived when a ship full of deceptive green pigs washes ashore with agendas all their own.

The pacing of Angry Birds is surprisingly efficient; reminiscent even to the impeccable scene-splicing work of DreamWorks in fact.  Puns and double entendres abound within the dialog but never is it off-putting enough to offend young ears.  Older ears, however, will likely find much to chuckle about here.

Detractors are quick to cite a lack of depth or richness of plot in their criticisms but truth be told, there is more story to be found here (and delivered well enough across an interesting cast of characters) than many CG features with absolutely no source-material restrictions to consider whatsoever (again think Minions, Penguins, the Ice Ages etc.)

If you're in the market for some lighthearted laughs and a quickly paced romp laced with lovely tropical visuals, look no further.  Just remember; not unlike the app upon which this film is based, expect the concept of squashing little green pigs into mush to make a whole lot of sense.",1486944000,,3113,4.841509433962264

The humor in this is far from childish. Like most current ""children's cartoons"" the humor is geared more for adults. Although there are some really great running gags. If you have children, I'm not sure this will have things that might traumatize a child. However handle with care anytime you have two opposing forces.",1485129600,,619,4.336206896551724

7736690,5,B01EK44KXE,Definitely worth renting for $3 on Amazon. It has a lot of adult references that kids may not understand and they are little stupid but still funny. It's not good enough to watch over and over but I'd watch it another every 6 months,1484265600,,232,4.295454545454546

I had ZERO expectations and, frankly, thought I'd be bored out of my skull. Surprise, surprise - this movie actually delivered!! It's cute, it's funny, it's sarcastic - and it still has a bit of ""life lessons"" in there. I don't say this often, but this one deserves a sequel.

The only reason I rated this 4 rather than 5 stars is because I wasn't bowled over by the person who voiced Red - a little lacking, IMO.",1484092800,,519,4.350515463917525

7736717,1,B01EK44KXE,"I'll be succinct: this bird-brained snoozefest rules the roost when it comes to The Worst Animated Movies of 2016. Yes, I realize that it's based on a very simple videogame, the world of which makes Mario seem as complex as The Lord of the Rings, but that doesn't excuse such a painful film adaptation. In their efforts to create a world, characters, a theme and a plot, the crew behind this turkey has stuffed it with sub-par writing, jokes that don't work, unmemorable characters, annoying use of pop songs, vulgarity, politically-correct pandering, and no reason to care what's going on. Plus there are at least two moments when I could only shake my head and murmur ""What was that?"" because those moments simply made no sense.

Okay, there is ONE funny line. I'm going to reveal it to you so you can save 90 minutes of your life and whatever the price of this flick on Blu-Ray is (thank god I rented it):

SPOILER

(Red Bird, watching a long line of baby birds following their mother) ""Jeez, haven't you heard of bird control?""

Ha ha, not bad, but that's the only real laugh in this film.

I barely finished this, and then immediately rented ""Despicable Me"" again (even though I'd rented it the day before) to get the memory of this dud out of my mind. Frankly, ""The Angry Birds"" is so awful that it makes that dog of a film ""The Secret Life of Pets"" look like Best In Show. Do not rent this unless you think you'd enjoy watching the cinematic equivalent of a rotten egg. This flick's a real stinkeroo.",1483574400,2,1507,4.5054945054945055

7736904,4,B01EK44KXE,"Adults get a lot to love about this movie.  In the lair of the hero Eagle that is the supposed guardian of the birds of Bird Island (and who has not been seen for decades) is a gold record album of music by-----The Eagles.  I doubt that 4 year olds will catch this bit.  The retired guardian also has some good bits about growing older that grown ups, especially grand parents, will enjoy.  New age feel good clap trap takes a major hit, which I liked and the theme of the story has suspicious immigrants coming in uninvited to do the local society no good, a nice cautionary item.
  The little ones will like the fast pace and colorful birds.  They will also like the puke jokes-several, always a winner.  They will enjoy the very many fart jokes, as did I.  They will also like the two nicely done snot jokes.  Body fluid jokes (one poop joke included) always please the younger set.  The single pee joke is a doozy that eveyone will notice.
  At the end of the movie the dastardly pigs get their just reward and we are treated to a brand new crop of totally cute new hatched chicks.  all the birds have huge eyes which humans respond to with favor.",1479168000,,1151,4.317757009345795

These characters were so much fun and so cute that I had a really goofy smile on my face from start to finish.

They loved this movie.  Yes, there are a few moments that my friends were disappointed about, but I guess my outlook on life is a bit different.  I'd much rather my kids watched something humorous like this than all the Disney movies where teenagers kiss and get married.  Seriously, this is a movie about animated birds and pigs.  Much better than watching movies about Disney princesses and then thinking that's real life!  At least my kids won't be trying to launch themselves in a imitation of this movie, like my friends' kids who are constantly talking about boyfriends/girlfriends/getting married and wanting to kiss each other.",1477785600,,807,4.804347826086956

7737230,4,B01EK44KXE,"For a movie that is a spin off money maker for a computer game, The Angry Birds Movie was pretty entertaining. I only played the game a couple of times and didn't really see what the attraction was, but still recognised most of the main characters and other aspects such as the slingshot playing a major role in this movie. I also played some terrible go kart racing Angry Birds character game. I do recall a pink bird which isn't in the film as being the second main character in the kart game. All the main bird characters in this one are male, it's a bit odd that they didn't include the usual token sidekick female character in a kids film. Perhaps the pink bird will appear in the sequel. I really liked the Red Bird in this one though. Jason Sudeikis does a good job giving the iconic bird a personality and at the same time making you feel sorry for, like and root for the large eyebrowed feathered guy. I actually thought most of the stuff he was getting angry about was quite justifiable. The dad who acts like a jerk when he delivers the cake, the bird sneezing multiple times over his popcorn, really the other birds are surprised he doesn't just take their bad behaviour!

The basic plot of this one revolves around our angry red avian friend being sent to anger management by the court. There after getting into a fight with the sign, he learns it's some useless share your feelings hippy style nonsense session. Of course he is not impressed but this is also where he meets the other main characters from the game, the oversized red bird, yellow bird and large black bird that blows up. By the way none of the birds on this island can fly. Other than the yellow bird the other feathered characters are a little underdeveloped, but again that's probably what sequels will be for. The green pigs from the game arrive on a ship and are a fascination to the birds who have never seen pigs before. Everyone except for Red is blind to the fact the pigs are deceiving them but of course Red is dismissed as an an embarrassing annoyance. Like with the other sidekick bird characters, all the pigs except for the leader don't really have much of a personality.

The animation is 3D looking, although not quite as detailed as other major studio animated movies. There's plenty of adult jokes in this movie that may or many not go over the heads of children, but nothing that will harm them. There's also a lot of crude humour. Basically it's a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.

The region 4 DVD comes with 4 hatchlng mini movies which would go for around 5 minutes in total. They involve the new born chick characters who in the actual movie pretty much just looked at the camera and blinked with their big eyes looking cute and didn't do much else. They don't do much in these mini movies except for to play with a worm in one. Really the movie was about angry birds, not cute birds, they could have made some shorts with the other main characters or something that would have been more entertaining. There's also a music video for Blake Shelton's song Friends, and a few other extras.",1475280000,,3101,4.455985915492958

7737238,3,B01EK44KXE,"Im familiar with The Angry Birds in that I played the app once a few years ago upon getting a new smart phone.  And now here is the movie on this stunning Blu ray version.  There have been some excellent animated films in recent years.  Most have an excellent story, humor, a good soundtrack and colorful action.  The very best include a principled aspect targeted at the little ones.  Angry Birds has most of those elements although the story is simple and sketchy but consistent with the game.  The moral of the story is also a bit weak, bordering on non-existent.

Red (Jason Sudeikis) is a little red bird with bushy eyebrows.  As a kid he was always teased about the eyebrows and now as a grown-up lives on the edges of town next to the ocean.  His anger issues come out in force when he delivers a birthday cake to a family.  After his trial, the judge (Keegan-Michael Key) sends him to anger management class.  There he meets a couple other violators.  Chuck (Josh Gad) is a speedy, yellow roadrunner and Bomb (Danny McBride) is a huge, overstuffed blackbird.  Their counselor is Matilda (Maya Rudolph).

When a large ship lands on their shores, the town full of birds and an untold number of unhatched children, welcome the green pigs with open arms.  Only a few are on board headed by Leonard (Bill Hader).  Red suspects something is fishy, so investigates further, much to the dismay of the townsbirds.  Sure enough, the Trojan Horse is filled with more pigs, and later more ships of green pigs.  Their goal?  Eggs!  So Red, Bomb and Chuck decide to climb the mountain where the Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) resides.  They need his wisdom as to how to recover the eggs and the unhatched children within.  But the old bald eagle is fat and lazy and offers no immediate help.  So the little trio build their own ship (using TNT boxes) and sail to Pig Island along with a giant slingshot Leonard left behind.  Game on.

Frankly the best thing about this movie from the perspective of a grown-up is the soundtrack which features plenty of recognizable songs covered by contemporary artists.  Gad and Sudeikis are also a hoot as Chuck and Red.  There are enough off-color jokes for the adults which will fly over the heads of the kiddies in the audience.  The color is spectacular as is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  Subtitles come in English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese and a host of Asian languages.  There are also a ton of extras, although my rental copy didn't include them.  Finally, can someone tell me why these birds cant fly.",1475107200,,2552,4.616926503340757

I watched the whole movie which seemed like it was based on a screenplay or book that was written by someone with no talent for it.

This movie came out super late relative to the game's popularity. It does however stand on it's own. There's no need to play the game to enjoy the movie.

That said, there wasn't a lot of depth. Given the characters involved I thought there might be more subtle adult humor. Sadly no. It was a PG type movie with some anger issues. There was some humor - not enough to hold my attention. Not a ton of laughs. NO sophistication. Period. Josh Gad's character - such a distinctive voice - was irritating.

7737495,3,B01EK44KXE,"Angry Birds Movie is a movie based off of the hit game/app, called Angry Birds. There was also a cartoon that came out back in 2013 called Angry Birds Toon which has also received mediocre reviews and may have also been an unnecessary adaptation, though I haven't seen it. But what's different is that this one gives the birds legs and dialogue to work with.

It stars Red, a hot-headed red bird who reacts childishly to almost everything. Now, I am not a fan of irritable characters but in some scenes, I could see why the things that annoy him would be annoying, like for instance, a bird sitting next to you sneezing on your popcorn while you're trying to enjoy a movie.

Red and his friends, the crybaby, Bomb, and the hyperactive, crazy Chuck encounter pigs, who want to destroy the island. So, the kind- hearted Red and his friends must do something to try to stop them, which includes acting angry and using slingshots while also using special powers (now, I don't remember that in the game).

The character Chuck is usually really annoying. I don't see what's the deal with him zipping around but they could've developed his character more. He rarely has his moments where he's being kind, but unfortunately, it's stopped by Red, who's better but is still a mediocre character.

Bomb sometimes whines and it gets pretty annoying. Terrence is probably the best character out of this that I could think of. He's above average as he can be a little too aloof but his grunts are pretty funny and he does have some redemption towards the end. His character is inconsistent overall.

The movie tries to stay true to the franchise, but it has some unrealistic moments like the birds using special powers (now, I don't know if there is a game where that could happen, but if there isn't, put that in a game!) And I don't know how the baby birds can sing that well already and the village be restored that fast.

The animation and character designs are kind of cute, they do have some flaws but they're alright.

This was an unnecessary, corny adaptation to the game. Though, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it does have some funny moments. It relies unnecessarily on crude humor. And the mid-credits scenes were annoying.",1473465600,,2232,4.607052896725441

Their bad review was the only reason I didn't see this in theaters. They gave it bad reviews because they obviously align with the political left. This movie has a lot of political truths to it. It is very funny unlike some of the recent animated movies I've seen such as ""The Secret Life of Pets"" which was quite boring and had very few laughs.",1473379200,,483,4.438202247191011

To clarify, they're was no outright swearing, but the words used were simply plays on what is normally said when swearing.  For instance, ""pluck"" was used in place of another word, which rhymes. In our family clean, wholesome movies are watched as a family, and movies that are geared toward children, but aren't fit for them, don't get watched. And language is a major issue with me.

The Great Eagle the Angry birds revere comes strolling out of his cave like he has been on a binge and pee's into the lake below his cave.

7737659,1,B01EK44KXE,"I regretted not having read any reviews for this before renting this for my kids to watch on a lazy Saturday night. It had several current and former SNL player voices, and it felt like a series of bad SNL sketches tenuously connected by a half-baked idea to form a movie bloated with tired jokes. In the first 15 minutes, I was wondering when it was going to be fun and/or funny. But it just kept trudging on to the next sketch, trying to outdo the former one. Someone must have thought, ""A bird with anger management issues. What a great idea for a movie!"" That's where it must have stopped. There are some animated movies that are mainly for children, but with subtle humor that adults can enjoy. Humor wasn't subtle, just in your face. It was all a bit too mean. In between the bad writing, it seems they had to show someone getting hurt or insulted at least in every other scene. For adults, the jokes were just bad. For kids, I cringed that they had to hear stuff that I'd hate for them to repeat later with friends. My eyes were rolling from the beginning. There are a lot of good and mediocre animated kid friendly movies out there. I'm not saying your kids won't enjoy this--you know, because it's a cartoon and Angry Birds is popular (what's not to like, right?)--but I would recommend you try anything else first.",1472774400,4,1324,4.430327868852459

The worst scene showcased Red viewing statues of ""art"" in an anger management office which showcased a statue of an orgy that Red claimed was exotic). Although most young children may not pick up on these it is still present. As an adult watching I did expect more from this movie and felt it was a bit lacking since it was based off of a game where you throw angry birds that have special abilities. This was only shown towards the end of the movie (maybe the last 30-40 minutes) and didn't showcase a lot of those abilities. That aside it was a decent movie. Not something I would purchase though unless you're a parent wanting to entertain your kids who loved the movie. I would not watch it again unless it was on TV and I wasn't able to find anything else.",1472342400,,866,4.487341772151899

7737799,4,B01EK44KXE,"Once a nifty (yet sometimes horrifyingly annoying) little game, now a full-length feature film.  I have been on the 4-year breeding plan,  often making happy family movie nights hard to pull off (ages range from 3-26 when they're all here).  The fact that the older kids played the game did help garner interest in the movie.  I digress.  Here is what I can point out from the adult perspective:

*Great cast:  Jason Sudeikis (Hall Pass) , Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), Peter Dinklage (midget from Pixels), Maya Rudolph (SNL), Bill Hader ('Fear,' Inside Out), Danny McBride (Land of the Lost), Danielle Brooks (Taystee, OITNB), and Sean Penn, to name some.

*Fun (at at time fun-ny soundtrack)
The Rick Astley made me laugh as it rang with nostalgia from my youth.
The opening includes some Black Sabbath, which is always cool.  Lol.
Many familiar and some lesser-known (KRS One...you old Sublime fans should remember them!).

*The infamous slingshot makes it's appearance into the plot as the film builds to the pivotal scenes in the storyline.

*There are some spontaneously funny scenes and adult references that make it most bearable for the adult viewer, which I appreciate since most kids movies make me want to dive into moving traffic.  Lol.

The anger management sessions are funny.

*You will see all of the characters from the app/game.

This movie is cute.  My daughter has had me watch it 7500 times already.  I had to rent it twice.  I'll take this over Frozen any day of the week!",1472083200,27,1491,4.826086956521739

7737814,5,B01EK44KXE,"Fun movie with a classic rock soundtrack.  Adults would like this movie and its sitcom style plot with a portion of the movie centered around Red, the main character's, ""anger management"" therapy sessions and the friends he makes.  Each character is a misfit in their community, but their talents and friendship save the day. The pigs are delightfully colorful and their city especially would appeal to those who like retro industrial cartoon imagery.  The color palettes of the cities, island and environments are all very well done. The ""boss"" pig is of course up to no good, but he's like mayor Boss Hogg in the Dukes of Hazard you can't help but kind of like him and his charm (plus he knows how to throw a party).  While this movie is a cartoon the PG'ish jokes are more geared toward adults, however pre-school age kids and up will probably enjoy it for the steady action and bright colors.",1471910400,,896,4.651898734177215

The liberal slant in this film is unmistakable: The ""almighty"" Bald Eagle is a legend school children don't even believe in anymore. Our colleges literally teach our young people that Americans ""suck everything!"" When the angry birds seek him out, they discover that he is an old, overweight, decadent version of himself that can't even fly anymore, let alone do anything about the immigrant pigs who have invaded Bird Island, welcomed by the Judge as well as virtually all the other birds, even though their true intentions are to steal and eat their eggs.

This is truly a movie for our times as illegal immigrants blow up more and more things we worked hard to build, as the Red bird with the big eyebrows puts it, and steal our children with their ideological poison, if not by actual kidnapping.

This film is well made and humorous. The nap-of-the-earth and aerial scenes are worth a look on a big screen, if you're into that like I am!",1471305600,2,1059,4.682795698924731

I've never seen a 3D movie before (weird I know at 35 lol) so that was unique for all three of us to experience. My 8 year old son and 7 year old nephew LOVED the movie, saying ""this is the best movie I've ever seen!"" numerous times and stating that it gets ""a 10 out of 10"", and the story of the red bird Chuck going from an orphaned outsider to a valued hero of the community was a very tearful message about antibullying (he was teased for his eyebrows throughout the movie). Overall, I believe the critics were way too hard on this film like they were with the Minions movie. The boys have been hardcore Angry Bird fans since they were toddlers so it was definately special for them, and for today's tablet touchscreen kids, it was pretty neat to see the app come to life. :)",1469577600,3,1299,4.179282868525896

With all other films (other than Ghostbusters 2016) I have seen available thus far, you are left to choose between one or the other, 4K or 3D, equating to twice the money spent. I own the LG OLEDE6P which is a 4K 3D TV with HDR10 and Dolby Vision, so this is a perfect match. Almost all LG TVs offer both 4K HDR and 3D.

Most people (myself included) will only buy one of these two formats. I choose 3D over 4K HDR because on my TV it is passive 3D technology, upscaled to 4K and TRULY LOOKS AMAZING!!!  However, I would like to have 4K HDR copy as well.

When an island populated by happy, flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies, its up to three unlikely outcasts with anger problems  Red, Chuck, and Bomb  to figure out what the pigs are up to.

What did I think?

The thought of a movie based on an app filled me with dread but this movie had more charm than it had a right to. Its hardly going to be remembered as a classic but there are enough gags  both relating to the game and life in general  to keep most attentions on the screen.

7738050,1,B01EK44KXE,"From the trailers, it looked like a promising video game adaptation. The jokes in some of the trailers were funny, so I though they would be just as funny in the theater. OHHHHHH was I mistaken... First, I'll give some positives. The redesign of the characters, while different, we're good redesigns, and in my opinion, are better than the original designs. The animation looked nice (sometimes) and was fairly detailed. The voice acting was... Serviceable. It certainly wasn't bad acting, but there were times where it seemed the actors weren't talking their roles seriously, or sounded bored. Unfortunately, that's about as good as it got... The jokes were tolerable for about the first fifteen minutes, but after that, nearly every joke is just green pigs waving their derrieres at the audience, or just talking about butts. Maybe a gay joke thrown in there. There is one point where an eagle pisses for a full 45 seconds, and everybody in the theater was laughing like hyenas, yet I was the only person disgusted by the scene. I might be just stuck up, but I really thought it was just stupid. Though on the subject of jokes l,there was one joke, a reference to ""The Shining"", which actually made me laugh, but here, I was the only person laughing. But what's a movie without a story? Well, no story would have been better than the one in this movie. While it's basically an adaptation of the minimal story from the first game, the writing was juvenile, and the story had no good sense of pacing. For a short movie, it felt like it dragged on forever. With okay animation, mediocre voice acting, and horrible writing and abysmal jokes, The Angry Birds movie is just fowl.

7738053,1,B01EK44KXE,"The entire concept of birds sacrificing themselves to knock pigs off construction sets is easily an idea I could have come up with last Friday night at 2:30am after a strong overdose. But who cares, right? Thats what makes Angry Birds so oddly engaging to play! So of course, this is the perfect material to make a motion picture out of! And you know what, The Angry Birds Movie is the most beautiful, most thoughtful experience Ive ever sat through in a cinema, met with some wonderful characters, hilarious gags, and a message that is suitable for all ages.

Ha! Had you there, didn't I? Gosh, I almost had to force myself to type that. Right from this films announcement, I was expecting this movie to be just a series of super unfunny gags only toddlers would find funny, along with a real overused message to make this feel like somewhat of a complete movie. And sure enough, the result met all my expectations to the tee. I mean, come on. I have always enjoyed the iPhone game, but how could a 97-minute story of these birds possibly be decent?

Well, just like this:

Step 1. You make the main character an underdog with an anger issue who is disrespected by the town.
Step 2. You set up his team through an anger management class.
Step 3. You introduce the green pigs as the main villains a quarter of the way through the movie.
Step 4. You make the main character the only one in the town who knows how to stop these bad pigs.
Step 5. You let these bad pigs steal the eggs of the birds in the town in order to eat them.
Step 6. You make the town's savior an absolute moron who the main character loses hope in.
Step 7. You save the actual game-playing part until the final moments, and only for five minutes tops.
Step 8. You throw in puns. Lots and lots of puns.

Ive gone crazy now after hearing, Happy hatch-day, Pluck my life, Insta-ham, and Kevin Bacon in Hamlet. But you know what? Toucan play at this. If this movie can go mad with bird and pig puns, so can I!

The movies egg-selent screenwriter Jon Vitti got his start writing adult comedies such as SNL and The Simpsons, and maybe he should have left his nest there. While he does sprinkle in some jokes that will fly over the kids heads, a majority of the humor here is winging it toward the 12 and younger crowd. But maybe thats not the problem. Maybe the problem is that he wrote out each character rather faithfully to their virtual counterparts, yet entirely unmotivated and all-around fowl. Every bird and pig in this movie is either:

A. Useless
B. Rude
C. Dumb
D. All the above

Owl go with option D.

You know that white egg-shaped bird named Matilda? Shes the teacher of the anger management class now, and is all sweet and calm, despite being an angry bird. Then that yellow triangle-shaped bird named Chuck is voiced by Josh Gad, and he is literally Olaf on crack. His best friend is that black bomb bird, and together they are so annoying that you ought to flip the bird at each of them. The enormous bird, named Terence, is the closest thing to funny this movie gets to, and he just flew right by without enough screen time. Then theres the little blue bird that splits into three, who doesnt even show up until the end-credits scene. Oh, and I guess theres Red. Yeah, no comment.

The world of these birds is also rather cheep. Basically it is all recreated from the designs in the game as well as the Toon series. Im sure it is a beautiful and creative world on screen, but I couldn't exactly tell, as everything in the frame was moving too fast for me to get a good look at the details. But essentially, the most genius thing they come up with is a pregnant bird carrying her egg strapped onto her stomach like a pregnant human. Yeah, seriouslywhat the duck?!

The jokes probably would have quacked me up if the animators actually took a breather in between each pratfall and each piece of rapid-fire dialogue. Also, if some jokes were removed entirely, that would help enormously. By jokes, I mean nipple gags, a bird beating up a statue, a malfunctioning stairway, and an eagle peeing into a pond for a full minute (yes, this movie actually resorts to that hawkward level of humor).

Okay fine, maybe there are a few redeeming messages. It does try to affirm that anger is good motivation to fighting for the right causes, but its entirely forgotten by the last few moments and is even deliberately mocked by the characters themselves. So yeah, no important values to be found here!

Im talon you, if a movie about the Angry Birds really needed to exist, then it should have be done by artists who actually gave a hoot. But even judging by an Angry Birds fan, this movie is not boosting the popularity of the franchise in any way. If anything, its just going to hurt the franchise. So stick with the game, theres no peeing eagles.

7738057,2,B01EK44KXE,"A work of cinema or a cynical 97-minute ad for a line of consumer goods?

That's the first question that springs to mind in the opening minutes of The Angry Birds Movie, a lavish computer-animated 3-D children's movie stuffed to the gills with rollicking fun, frolicking adventure, rockin' tunes, off-color humor - and more celebrity voice actors than you can shake a stick at, including Sean Penn, Maya Rudolph, Peter Dinklage, and Blake Shelton.

Shelton also contributes to the soundtrack. The 14-song collection has yielded several music videos and is currently on sale.

Scripted by prolific TV writer Jon Vitti (The Simpsons, The Critic, King of the Hill) and helmed by animators-turned-directors Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis, the movie is the latest addition to the obscenely large and lucrative franchise of Angry Birds video games, toys, books, comics, songs, and TV shows.

Although it's rated PG, its video-game-inspired frenetic pace, its prolific use of double entendres and bathroom humor, its heavy-metal- and rap-spiked soundtrack - not to mention the suggested violence that undergirds its story - make it a questionable investment for parents of young children.

Saturday Night Live alumnus Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses, Epic) stars as the film's reluctant hero, Red, a perpetually peeved pariah in the happy-go-lucky community of flightless birds who make their home in an Edenic village on Bird Island.

Orphaned before he hatched and mocked all his life for his loud, thick, Groucho Marx eyebrows, Red doesn't suffer fools gladly. That's a problem if you live in a village occupied by a guileless bunch who give new meaning to the term birdbrain. Red refuses to patronize one of the village's most popular shops, which offers daily hugs, and he assaults a customer who has hired him as a birthday clown.

What can you do with such unruly behavior. Judge Peckinpah (Keegan-Michael Key) sentences Red to an anger-management class run by the hyper-neurotic Matilda (Rudolph) and attended by a trio of other malcontents: Chuck (Frozen's Josh Gad) is a yellow-plumed Speedy Gonzales-type who seems to be high on meth and likes to flirt with boys and girls alike; Bomb (Danny McBride of Eastbound & Down), a huge gorilla-bird who explodes like TNT when upset; and Terence (Penn), a massive red bird who looks like he could be Red's dad.

The story gets going when a ship full of pigs arrives. Led by a bearded king named Leonard (Bill Hader), the newcomers are green, identical-looking, and aggressively amiable. The birdbrains all are taken in, while Red is deeply suspicious - then alarmed when he discovers the ship is full of TNT. No one pays heed to Red's ravings until the pigs take off with every single egg. Those are the birds' babies!

The hungry, egg-eating pigs have genocide in mind.

Yes, I said genocide. It's also the only term appropriate for what eventually befalls the evil pigs at the hands of the now-angered birds and their hero, Mighty Eagle (Dinklage).

While virtually all other animated films out there conclude with a lesson about tolerance and love of the other, including the Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon series, Angry Birds begins with this position only to subvert the message entirely. It sets up a scenario that justifies hatred and all-out war.

Don't get me wrong. Angry Birds doesn't depict any on-camera violence against person, bird, or pig. But there's a darkness at the heart of this movie that's hard to reconcile.

Put it down to the filmmakers' rather desperate attempts to appeal not only to the movie's pint-size target audience but also to their chaperones.

The Angry Birds

Movie teems with allusions to R-rated fare such as Game of Thrones and The Shining, and it features a hair-raising soundtrack.

For every celebratory tune by Shelton (""Friends"") and Demi Lovato (""I Will Survive""), we also get heavy-metal medleys that include snippets of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and full-length hard-core tunes such as Scorpions' ""Rock You Like A Hurricane,"" Limp Bizkit's cover of the Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" and KRS-One's ""Sound of da Police"" with its lyrics about crack dealers and gun-totin' cops.

I admit I fell victim to many a belly laugh watching The Angry Birds Movie. I loved Sudeikis' and Penn's performances. I'm not an advocate of Disney-cartoon-level naivete, and I tend to groove on subversive fare. But this movie has a creepy quality I can't shake off.",1464912000,2,4450,5.03265306122449

7738059,4,B01EK44KXE,"Red attends anger management classes and meets other angry birds. Pigs come to island and steal eggs to make an omelet on their island. Only Red can save the day.

The film used slapstick humor for the kids and an occasional scene that adults can enjoy such as ""The Shining""  pig twins. I haven't heard ""egg-cellent"" since Vincent Price spoke those words on ""Batman."" The film is light on heavy themes and saved money by avoiding high priced stars for the voices. Red was easy to identify with, but the rest of the birds were a bit shallow in character, but hey, it is just a movie for kids. Hatching eggs uses phrases similar to child birth for humor. Might want to wait for an inexpensive rental.

Guide: Bird standing and urinating like a man. Uses phrases like ""Pluck my life"" and ""Flocking birds.""",1464480000,19,802,4.555555555555555
7738060,2,B01EK44KXE,"The gags in the trailer were on par with the best Pixar movies, and with names like Maya Rudolph, Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage, Sean Penn, Keegan-Michael Key and Kate McKinnon, my wife and I were sure this was going be a laugh riot. Wrong. The only thing on par with Pixar was the animation.  The bulk of the gags were weak and often clich. Most of the content, especially in the first third of the movie, was so adult oriented (e.g. political/psychological struggles) that the children in the theater quickly lost interest. It wasn't until the birds began to battle with the pigs (not a spoiler for anyone who knows the game) that the children settled down. There was mild entertainment value in the avian sociopolitical struggles but it was all so hackneyed and humorously flat, it elicited a train of yawns from my wife and I. I'm certainly glad we didn't pay the luxury theater price (Captain America was playing -- we should have seen that, instead!) BTW: I'm an avid Angry Birds player, but not my wife, and we both walked away from the movie shaking our heads and wishing we hadn't wasted the time. Hopefully the new Disney movie, Alice Through The Looking Glass, is better!",1464220800,8,1195,4.6635071090047395
