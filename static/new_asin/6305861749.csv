I've always heard of Gundam, but never really pursued looking  into it as Dragon Ball Z was my more favorite show a few years back. Now  that anime is in full force with dvds, there's nothing holding me back from  picking up this series. This disc is definitely a must buy as was the  first. Now my set-up isn't as high tech as other reviewers might be. My dvd  player is one of the first gen Philips magnavox sets and a Panasonic  dvd-l50 portable dvd player, but as far as I can tell, there was nothing  wrong with the quality of the transfer. And I can tell when a transfer is  bad as I've gotten several discs with bad transfers like Highlander. The  menu screen is pretty much the same setup as the first so there should be  no confusion in getting around the disc. As for the story, pick it up  yourself and watch it. I highly recommend it cause the Gundam pilots have  some serious mental issues. :)",968544000,,983,4.2771739130434785
1083839,5,6305861749,An animation Cell is the actual image they use to make a cartoon. This DVD is so clear that it's like watching the actual animation table they made it on. The colors and scenes are flawless. Simply incredible. My friend and I  were completely blown away. A definite must have DVD!  BUY IT. I did along  with the other 3 Gundam DVDs. They are beautifully made!,964569600,,359,4.409090909090909
1083840,5,6305861749,"I have kept my eyes glued to my tv ever since I first caught a glimps of the Gundam Wing episode on Comedy Central.  I have to say this is one of the best animes I have ever since.  It has one of the best plots, character  building, and action scences.  If you like a anime with alot of  ""meat"" to it, this is the one for you.  This isn't your old  Saturday Cartoon!",962928000,,366,3.864864864864865
1083841,5,6305861749,"As Gundam Wing starts to explode in America, it is already a huge hit in Japan.  This show is rated in Japan as one of the top shows out there.  I have the first and second DVD's containing episodes 1-10, and I strongly  suggest that you buy the first and second as well.  They are very adicting.  A show with a great plot and great battle scenes deserves nothing less  than a five star rating!",962150400,3,394,4.1866666666666665
1083842,5,6305861749,"Ok, in general the Gundam series has always been a favorite of mine. first off it has some great action sequences and a nice story line thats not TOO hard to fallow if your a littel new to the Gundam series... but all in all  i must say that the american DVD release of New Mobile Report: Gundam Wing  was a welcome sight! even though this particular DVD is not out yet i DO  own the First one and it is something every gundam fan should own if you  can't find the subtitled episodes from Japan that is :)",958089600,5,505,4.070707070707071

7896526,4,6305861749,"Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,557,4.6938775510204085
7896527,5,6305861749,This is a rare and one of a kind anime. It has great balance between giant killing robots and political drama.,1252972800,,110,4.285714285714286
7896528,5,6305861749,"The first Gundam Wing dvd started with a bang, and finished with a revelation about who Relena really is. This dvd continues where the last left off with Relena's return to earth. But when OZ tries to take Relena out of the picture will Heero place the mission first, or give in to his feelings for her?
The first episode is good, but the second episode has in my opinion the first HUGE plot twist in the series. The Gundam pilots are manipulated by OZ into destroying the same kind of people they're supposed to protect, and this allows OZ to start a world-wide revolution. The Earthsphere Alliance were creampuffs compared to OZ, and now we know why. The Treize Assassination deals with the aftermath of the previous episode, but the real high point is Wu Fei's confrontation with Treize. But is Treize really as bad as he seems?
One of my favorite episodes in the entire Gundam Wing series is episode 9, Portrait of a Ruined Country. This episode focuses primarily on Zechs and his simultaneous attempt to free his home country and master the awesome Mobile Suit Tallgeese. We already know that Zechs is the greatest non-Gundam pilot on earth, but when he first tries to pilot Tallgeese...he nearly dies. The speech he makes about just what exactly the Tallgeese is should NOT be missed, to say nothing of the AWESOME battle scene where he first tries it out. And to top it all off, at the end of the episode Zechs takes off his mask.
And of course it would be cruel of me not to mention the last episode to be found on the dvd, where Heero and Zechs duel for the first time.
This is a great series for people who love Mecha, and Gundam fans in particular. And if you love the first few discs, keep getting more! The series just better and better as it goes along (in character development, action scenes, animation quality, and just plain overall greatness).",1053302400,2,1862,4.544642857142857
7896529,5,6305861749,"Treize, the leader of OZ, has tricked the Gundam pilots to kill the leaders of the Earth-Sphere Alliance.  The Gundam pilots thought they were killing members of OZ, but they were fooled by Treize!
  Meanwhile, Zechs discovers a flaw in the tallgeese and we learn that Relena is Zechs's sister!  Zechs wears his mask as a sign of shame we also learn.",1021075200,,350,4.596774193548387
7896530,5,6305861749,"The Episode: Scenario for Bloodshed is great, showing how OZ launches a coup dtat against the alliance. The events in the Treize Assasination epidose are key to psyche of wufei especially in episode 49. you will finally get to she the Tallgeese in action! highly recommended.",985305600,,275,5.0
7896531,5,6305861749,"Being new to the world of anime, I've yet to see the entire Gundam Wing series through, I actually didn't even like it until I saw enough of the beginning to understand what in the bloody heck was going on, but now there's no denying that I'm hooked, and this is the DVD that cemented my addiction to Gundam Wing.  Great plot, wild animation, deep sub-plots and truely dynamic and unusual characters all combine to make this a perfect example of what makes anime great.",979171200,,469,4.517647058823529
7896532,5,6305861749,I really enjoyed the Gundam Wing series in general and this DVD in particular. This DVD covers episodes 11-15. In this part of the series the action starts to heat up as the OZ forces step into the forefront and begin to fight back against the gundams. The quality of animation and the depth of plot makes Gundam Wing an exceptional series.,970099200,,340,4.5
