8252746,4,B0013RNIGC,"I love watching a master woodworker as he makes complicated look easy.  For me the highlight of this DVD was the section with Frank Klausz.  There are other video sections but for me they are secondary.  Watching Frank cut dovetails using a bow saw saw (yes, he used a bow saw to hog out the waste between the pins!) was amazing.  I spent hours in the workshop trying to approximate this stunning show of skill and I was using a coping saw.  No luck, but after 4 hours and turning a bunch of pine into firewood, I think I'm a little better.

This woodworking DVD is part of a series by Woodworking in Action.  I went to their web site looking for more DVDs and found that they have stopped accepting new subscriptions.  Back issues are available though, both through their site and also here at Amazon.",1312588800,,802,4.408163265306122
