Despite all the hype about it ""starring"" Rob, he shows up for about a minute.  His performance in that minute is, as usual, superb, but it's a total waste of his talent and his time.  The ""movie"" is actually five completely unrelated segments (each with it's own credits at the end), the best one actually being the one with James Franco.  The last one (with Robert Downy, Jr, who stands by his car asking various women to ride with him -- and that's all) makes no sense at all, as it is in itself simply a bunch of unrelated scenes all jumbled together.

4127622,2,B003IMGTH0,"Just as there is a surge in the attention being paid to flash fiction (stories that are limited, in general, to 1000 words) and other evidences that we are running too fast through life to really commit to just about anything (relationships, long novels, thoughtful motion pictures, food that requires more than 40 seconds to 3 minutes in the microwave, instant weight loss, chats on the computer or cell phone rather than sit down conversations, etc), so here is a DVD that presents five stories with  the loose theme of love.  In some ways these vignettes work - quickie ideas that don't merit further exploration than what is offered - and in more ways they seem so poorly made that even the excuse of low budget can't cover the results.

This DVD is five stories, briefly described as one form of love and the results, given a name, and then proceeds to a short story attempted to make passable by the use of star names but self-defeating in the fact that they seem shot on home video gear - grainy, poorly focused, meaningless lighting, and embarrassingly bad script writing.  SUMMER HOUSE (shot in Normandy we are informed in the credits stars a house with the incidental, very brief  placement of Robert Pattinson in the deep shadows as the love who got away from Talulah Riley and who  wants back. BLUE POLES is a truck ride in Australia with Sam Worthington on his way to Canberra to see a painting called 'Blue Poles' and offers a ride to Emma Randall whose naivet&eacute; crossroads don't seem to alter the driver's desires. GRASSHOPPER places James Franco on a train with Rachel Miner, a Goth-like sex kitten who retrieves Franco's cell phone and opens a thankfully brief silly near blackmail episode to retrieve the cell phone - with a corny twist at the end. PENNIES places Amy Adams in a diner, taking a job as a waitress to make enough cash to keep her daughter from being 'cut' - the 'cut turns out to be less than dramatic - and discovers the varieties of people's reactions to diner help on several levels. AUTO MOTIVES deals with cars - Michael Imperioli tries in vain to seduce girls into his car parked in Washington Square while Robert Downey Jr appears VERY briefly as a car detailer who wants to get in front of the attention of Director James Cameron.

Why make this five-part movie?  Perhaps it is a project of a wealthy philanthropist who needs a diversion, perhaps it is payback for favors in the industry.  The material is lack luster and it is surprising that the star actors took on the project. But then step back and consider the means: this is one way to get flash fiction on the screen for little money and a lot of hope that people will buy into the concept that from little seeds, gardens grow.

4127623,1,B003IMGTH0,"There is no point to any of these short stories. How they got James Franco and Robert Downey Jr to do them is beyond me. To even go further, the picture quality is horrendous!!! It was like watching an old video tape or a burned dvd. Yes..it was that bad!! The stories were so pointless,however,that I don't think a high def picture would have improved it anyways. Do not waste your time. At least this was a rental from Netflix.",1288742400,5,429,4.375
4127624,2,B003IMGTH0,"In direct contrast to Staci's ""review"", this is a real movie, just not your typically formatted movie that you may be used to watching. Staci, maybe you should not rely solely on IMDb for your information when you post online.

What I know about this film so far is:  It is being released straight to DVD on Nov. 2. It stars all those mentioned above, but spread out in 5 separate shorts that make up the 93 minutes runtime. All the shorts overlap in some way and fashion to tie them all together. Each short has a different director as well. ""The Summer House"" is the opening short, followed by (in chronological order): ""Blue Poles""; ""Grasshopper""; ""Pennies..."" and finishing with ""Washington Square"". I hope this clears up any confusion.

BTW Staci, why rate it 1 star when you haven't even seen it? Why rate it at all BEFORE you even see it? If Amazon should remove anything, it should be your uninformed ""review""...well, it really isn't a review at all, now is it.  I will temporarily rate this 5 stars just to balance out the previous ""non-review"".  I will edit my rating (if I can) and add my insight/opinion after viewing this film, hopefully before the Nov. 2 release, as I already have an advanced copy of this title.

Post edit:  The fifth short is called ""Auto Motives"", which is comprised of 4 or 5 mini-stories, one of which is called ""Washington Square"", and one with Robert Downey Jr. as a car detailer working for James Cameron.  I would rate ""Pennies..."" (Amy Adams) the most interesting.  You'll get hooked on the storyline...great acting by Adams with a twist thrown at you in the end.  ""Blue Poles"" (farmboy picks up a wannabee hippie) & ""Grasshopper"" (businessman loses Trio on train, found by trashy-dressed girl), are interesting enough, while ""Auto Motives"" (just a complete mess) & ""The Summer House"" (girl is saddened by a lost love) are wastes of time.  After watching, I change my rating to 2 stars.  Besides ""Pennies..."", it is not worth going out of your way buy.  Rent it and see for yourself first.",1287964800,53,2031,4.671348314606742

4127651,5,B003IMGTH0,"I'd been searching for this obscure RPattz gem, ""Summer House"", in the US for a long time.  I happened across this DVR only due to Amazon suggested items. I was besides myself with excitement that Summer House was among the vignettes and the first in the line up.  This coveted segment is not more than 30 minutes in length with RPattz being in approximately 5 minutes towards the end.  The storyline is not unique - essentially boy cheats on girl, boy follows girl to breathtaking summer mansion to reconcile, but despite his obvious irrestible charms, girl comes to her senses and rejects him.  What makes this story different is that it is shown in comparison and timeframe with the actual first man walking on the moon footage.  I tried to decifer what the common theme was, but perhaps the point is still lost on me; nonetheless, I enjoyed the 1960's time period clothing/hairstyles, the breathtaking English mansion setting, lush greenery, and other fine acting.  As far as the RPattz piece, I'm biased, but I absolutely loved it and have played that little section over and over again.  It's interesting to see RP playing the scoundrel for once, topped off with long wispy greasy hair and all his now classic expressions down to sticking his tongue out included.  Ironically, one of his lines is literally right out of New Moon and I keep picturing Bella there.  Plus, with his recent real life romance turbulence, it puts an uncanny spin on the exchange.  Consequently, Tahlulah gave a noteworthy, convincing performance as the anguished, spurned, but resolved ex-girlfriend; it was also impressive to see her evolve into a strong lead role here coming out from behind the scenes of her secondary role in Pride and Prejudice. I look forward to seeing her in future lead roles.  Shamefully, I invested less time in the other vignettes, which include a range of impressive Hollywood heavy hitters portraying so that's the way life goes scenarios.  The section with versatile James Franco includes a profound, disturbing gory murder.  The section with Sam Worthington and a traveling musician is mildly engaging, but I can't think of Sam in any other role except for Avitar or his playing Avitar again in Clash of the Titans.  The segment with Robert Downey, Jr. is disappointing as it's very choppy with visual images coming at you quickly; hard to see/know what is going on or even that it's the reknowned charismatic RD, Jr. in the scenes.  There's a section with acclaimed Amy Adams as a waitress and all the brutality that goes with that work - well done, but I feel like we've seen her in this beaten down persona before.  Overall, based on the DVD title, I had hoped that it included gushy over the top romantic vignettes like Valentine's Day; although not the case here, the sketches were still thought-proking.  As far as my recommendation of this DVD, if you're an avid RPattz fan, you'll want this to complete your collection. It's well worth it to fangirl me!  Otherwise, this DVD is no Slaves of NY; so unless you're a big fan of the other actors on the roster, wait until it goes on sale to view on a rainy day.  Enjoy!",1351382400,,3138,4.756457564575646

another multiple-story movie. But which was a lot better, actually.

offbeat, and Love & Distrust fits that role.",1339718400,,461,4.435294117647059
4127657,5,B003IMGTH0,"I have to say I was shocked to see all the 1-star reviews when I checked on Amazon prior to  watching Love and Distrust--I was even MORE shocked when I finished watching it!  I have to say that I have been sorely disappointed by the junk Hollywood has been spinning out nowadays--Love and Distrust was definitely like a breath of fresh air.

 I normally am not in the majority; yet, sadly, the way the reviews are so one-sided on this one makes me wonder about the moral character of most people today, as well as their emotional and intellectual IQs.  I can only hope that most of the reviews are from teenagers who were just expecting 90 minutes of Pattinson and who still have time to mature and appreciate what really matters in life...

  That being said, I did not see the trailer so all I knew was that it included several decent actors and what the case description said (and of course the image of Rob Pattinson on the cover.  I have since watched the trailer, and since there were no words, only clips from the 5 short films, I cannot say that it was ""misleading"", as others have said. Although it may have been nice to know that this is a collection of short films and not a feature-length film (could have put a note at the end of the preview for example, like ""A collection of short films""), I don't believe that would have changed many reviewers' opinions anyway.

I am not a huge Pattinson fan so I was not disappointed as many of the other reviewers were that he was barely in the film, although I was a bit surprised at the blink-and-you'll-miss-him part he did have.  However, with so many other great actors, this did not come as a shock.  I do not base my reviews on the actors involved, but rather the acting itself, what emotions it invokes in me and what messages it succesfully(or not) portrays.

James Franco and Amy Adams(who actually each played the main character in their respective shorts) did amazing jobs, as did the other famous ones in their brief roles.

This film was succesful in portraying various scenarios that we all might find ourselves in, including financial woes, stereotypes, alcoholism, sexuality and of course love and trust issues.  It kept me interested, as most movies nowadays have a problem doing thru 2 whole hours and it  actually felt like it understood the human condition.  The fact that several great actors were involved was just icing on the cake.

PS. If you really want to see a movie that's a good 2-hour waste of your time, try the new Arthur with Russel Brand or No Strings Attached with Ashton Kutcher.",1335657600,14,2569,4.547826086956522

This is not really a film.  It is really a collection of short films about 10 - 15 minutes in length produced by different production companies, directors, actors, and crews.  Evidently some scam artist with a computer decided they could find a random picture of Robert Pattinson, download several random short films by actors like Rob, Amy Adams, James Franco, and Robert Downey, Jr. that they each decided to make before they were stars and in desperate need to pay the rent, and call it a ""movie"".

The reason I give this movie one star is because Rachel Miner did an excellent job on playing her role, otherwise I'll take off that only star. I called redbox and they willing to give me a code for one free dvd rental, so i just lost 2 hrs for watching these shorts...",1302048000,3,1105,4.013698630136986

Bizarre and plain plots, rusty acting (except Amy Adams in Pennies, one of the short films), and mediocre cinematography...",1296259200,2,366,4.382352941176471
4127669,1,B003IMGTH0,"Honestly, and I mean this, maybe the worst move I've ever seen in my life.

It's simply unbelieveable that a cast like this would produce such a dreadful bunch of stories to compose a sorry excuse for a movie.  It has appearances by Amy Adams, James Franco, Robert Downey Jr, James Cameron, and more!

The movie is made of several different stories; all are which seem to go nowhere.  The directing is amatueur, the script is terrible, and there is no depth at all to it.

The story starring Amy Adams has a good feel to it, but the whole thing leading up to the ending is boring.

The last one is the worst, just a bunch of confusing scenes to run absolutely nowhere (the guy from the Sopranos tries to hit on women on a sidewalk and keeps getting turned down.  That's it...seriously...that's it.  End credits)  And he's a great actor; what were all these people thinking.

To sum it up, I rented this for $1.00 and I'm still upset.  Absolutely terrible. Save yourself!",1296259200,,970,4.485714285714286
4127670,1,B003IMGTH0,"I picked this up at the store because the front of the dvd lists some of my favorite actors.  Despite never having heard of this movie, I read the description of it on the back (which is the same as the product description on here) and decided I'd give it a go.  Total waste of $15!

This dvd is not a movie, it's a collection of short films.  Even though I figured this out within the opening credits (which looks like someone put it together with windows movie maker), I decided I would still give it a chance before totally regretting the purchase.  The first film with Robert Pattinson was so bad I nearly threw the dvd into the trash, but I had to watch the rest just to make sure it didn't get better.

It didn't.  Now I know why the product description describes this dvd like it is one movie following several story lines (think Crash), because the person who put this crap together knows that these short films are so unworthy of being purchased that they have to trick you into buying it!!

I wouldn't even suggest renting this, much less paying full price to own it.",1295654400,2,1077,4.35
4127671,1,B003IMGTH0,"Do not buy this DVD, the marketing on this thing is heinous!  I was most interested in seeing the made for TV movie ""Summer House"", however, there are only about 3"" of RPatz in the brief 1st story. The rest are OK with other known actors, but do not buy thinking you are getting 1 hr or less of the beloved Rob Pattinson.

very disapointed",1295395200,2,339,4.2
4127672,1,B003IMGTH0,This was really a waste of time. If you are interested in this because of R. Patt's then just rent The Summer House on Itunes for a dollar. It is a combination of short films that each actor did separately. I suppose the one with Robert Downey jr. is funny but he is only in three minutes of this DVD. This is definitely not worth it. I say don't waste your money.,1295395200,2,364,4.069444444444445
4127673,1,B003IMGTH0,"The ""product description"" sounded intriguing -- if only the movie had lived up to it.  I love small glimpses into lives, snapshots, moments, etc. BUT they have to MEAN something.  These didn't.  It's too bad, too, as there were several terrific actors who did play their parts well, but they had little to work with.  The big problem?  Nothing connected the stories -- different time periods, different places and circumstances, different people who had nothing to do with anyone in any of the other short features.  This hodgepodge of situations might have even worked if there had at least been a theme that connected them all.  Or, if they really were individual short stories, they should have had a beginning, middle, and end or an overarching theme that added up in the end and made them worthy of standing alone.  Didn't happen.

It's wonderful to be innovative and try to create something new, but just zapping a bunch of half-baked stories together and calling it a movie is neither innovative nor creative.  It's just bad.",1295136000,2,1032,4.845714285714286
4127683,1,B003IMGTH0,"taking this POS back! my boyfriend and i rented this movie from a redbox - we are adventurous, so even though we had not heard of it before, we like the actors in the movie - so we decided to give it a try.  HUGE MISTAKE!!!! this IS the WORST movie of all time. ALL TIME. we actually wrote a note and put it in the case for the next unsuspecting renter. it reads: might be the worst 1.06 you ever spend... in your life.

we are hoping that the next victim will keep the note going, we feel the need to warn all of humanity - as this could be an indicator of the apocalypse - because it must be the work of the devil.

Daniel Radcliffe was one of the suporters for it in the credits. What was he thinking?

I understand short stories but these didn't even have a plot, aside from pennies which was the only one I could even barely get into.  I just can't believe that these actors would do a movies like this, especially James Cameron!!!  They must of been paid big bucks to agree to this.  The only thing I can come up with is that it was some sort of test to see if people would see a movie just because of the actors or something.  They had to of been paid a crap load of money to agree to doing this film.  I 100% do NOT recommend this movie...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!",1292112000,3,656,4.0859375

I didn't think anything could get worse than Creepshow 3 but this film truly exceeded the crap in ""crap factor""  This was pretty much a blind rental through Netflix for me but how can you go wrong with some great A list actors such as Robert Pattinson, Robert Downey Jr., & Same Worthington?  Well in this case WAAAAAAYYYYYY WRONG!!!!!  I used to make better films with my brother when I was 10 years old with an 8mm camera.  These short stories (if you can call them that) make ZERO sense.

My boyfriend and I tortured ourselves with this film and kept our fingers crossed that the stories would all come together at the end. Well, they didn't.

No one should have to go through what we went through. I would have much rather watched my daughter's movie selection, ""Barbie in A Fashion Fairytale."" At least her movie had a plot!

I don't ever comment on movies, good or bad, but this is one of those special situations where I feel the need to perform a public service and warn others. DO NOT RENT, BUY OR IN ANY WAY SUPPORT THE VIEWING OF THIS FILM!

I thought that with a cast that starred in it (or donated their presence) that this would be a great movie to watch.  Oh was I ever so wrong and ever so disappointed.  As others have posted, 5 short stories.  I did not see them tying together as a few posted.  Robert Pattinson was brief and the lighting so bad you could barely see him.  Robert Downey Jr. was wasted on his bit part.  Sam Worthington was ok, but should stick to something with action in it.
I did actually like the Amy Adams' ""Pennies"" story.  As stated in a previous review, it does have a twist at the end that you are not expecting.  James Franco didn't do too bad for what he was given to work with.  Regardless, I wish I had spent the time cleaning my toilets and cat's litter box rather then watching this movie.  If you MUST see it, please save yourself some money and go rent it first.  I'm sure it will be in the $5.00 bin at a major discount chain within a month.",1291075200,2,1043,4.078817733990148
