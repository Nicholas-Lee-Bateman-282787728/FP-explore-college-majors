4654800,5,B005CW117C,This is a replacement for VHS tapes purchased many years ago. The quality of these recordings is so much better than the tapes that it makes us wonder why we waited to long to make this purchase. We have always loved Alec Guinness as George Smiley so it is a genuine pleasure to be able to watch him again.,1335312000,2,306,4.203389830508475
4654801,5,B005CW117C,"I saw the recent 2011 movie version of the same Le Carre story of Tinker Tailor, there is simply no comparison. I always liked Gary Oldman, but Alec Guiness and the cast are excellent in the BBC staging, which is truer to the book. The accompanying Smiley's People is also wonderful.",1335225600,2,283,4.568627450980392
4654822,1,B005CW117C,"The series is fantastic, amazing, brilliant.
The low rating is for the seller in US. There's a big sticker on the packet ""this dvd you ordered is a region 2 DVD that requires a region 2 dvd or region free player. This dvd will ""not"" work on a normal USA (region 1 player.) This dvd requires a pic or region free player to work"" and then a suggestion of how to  return to Amazon ""accidental order"" presumably to help their seller rating, rather than misleading product description.
WTF not put the disclaimer as prominently in the description as it is on the received package?",1463529600,,575,4.528846153846154

4654825,1,B005CW117C,"Some folks when they ordered this product got an email or a note warning them thar the product won't work on US DVD players. I got neither the email or the note, and I didn't realize I was getting region 2 until I tried to play it, which was after I'd opened the thing, so I can't get my money back. I also think I ordered the thing by One-click, and I don't think the region 2 message was there to be seen, but I could be wrong about that. Bummer! I know it's my own damn fault, but I'm still feeling ripped off.",1438560000,2,513,3.9423076923076925
4654826,5,B005CW117C,Great to have the all time BBC classic. Hope Amazon does the same with Rumpole of the Bailey!,1428278400,2,93,4.222222222222222
4654827,5,B005CW117C,"Awesome! Anyone that watched the movie remake would benefit from this. I mean, Alec Guinness can't be beat! He is Smiley! Have the books and this follows the storyline without losing anything.",1421366400,3,192,5.03125
4654828,5,B005CW117C,"Alec Guinness was a class actor . . . he carried this series (there were some excellent actors in this series). The series was typical of the high class of production that the BBC released in that time, and continues to do so today.",1420243200,2,232,4.295454545454546
4654829,1,B005CW117C,"Very deceptive of Amazon to offer this DVD for sale in the United States.  PREFACED BY NEW !  It is USELESS to but in the U.S.
Scrolling to the bottom of the page is necessary to see in small print that the DVD will only play on European machines and is therefore useless to me in Brooklyn, NY  I resent paying $5.00 to return this to you!",1414972800,,339,4.029850746268656
4654830,1,B005CW117C,"I bought this without noticing that it is for ""Region 2"" machines. The US has Region 1 machines. It came with a big tag on the outside of the DVD warning that it won't play on US machines, so i returned it. I didn't notice such a warning and, going back to this page now, I still don't see a bold warning, although I do see it says (in small print in the technical section) it is for Region 2 machines. I suggest Amazon place a large font, bod face, warning on the page. But at least consider this a warning to you.

BTW, these are two of the greatest movies ever! Doesn't do them justice to call them a TV series.",1413158400,,614,4.032786885245901
4654831,5,B005CW117C,"To put this in the simplest terms these series are BRILLIANT. Putting them together like this is far too long coming but i am satisfied. I was 9 years old when the first series first aired and as a child i was enthralled and am even moreso after watching literally dozens of times. All the acting and writing is again, BRILLIANT. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME ACTUAL TALENT IN SO MANY RESPECTS TO WATCH OVER AND OVER.",1410825600,4,411,4.35064935064935

4654833,5,B005CW117C,"To me this is one of the Great Spy books.  For those of you worried about the zone 2 limitation, I enjoyed it on my MAC!!  Both Tinker and Smilley's are related stories!!",1400630400,,170,4.121212121212121
4654834,5,B005CW117C,I cdan't think of another actor that could have ever played  Smiley.  He was Smiley.  You felt that he had been doingthat joball his life.  It is a story thast is not  at all contrived.  You just know that what you are wastchking really happened.,1389830400,,246,4.355555555555555
4654835,5,B005CW117C,"The late '70s/early '80s BBC productions of Le Carre's great espionage diptych of Tinker Tailor/Smiley's People are really without peer, amongst dramatized spy stories. Alec Guinness is at the height of his powers as Smiley and the tales unfold with the implacable force of Greek tragedy. They capture the dismal art of espionage with with a clear, harsh eye. Absolutely everything in Smiley's world is dingy and cold and depressing; much as one would assume it to be in reality. Consider how tatty and threadbare the Circus looks. Perfect. Every scene seems like it was expunged of anything warm or happy or glamorous. And that's as it should be. The caveat with these DVDs, though, is technical. I assume the shows were shot on 16mm. A crime that it wasn't done on 35mm. And these are dark, grainy, ugly transfers. But that would be my only complaint.",1384300800,5,853,4.809523809523809
4654836,5,B005CW117C,"I could do a complex analysis of this but it is not really necessary. The books portrayed the tradecraft so accurately that it would be impossible to mess up any screenplay.
And the acting was some of the best you will ever see; Guinenss as Smiley managing to steal a scene by cleaning his glasses has stuck with me forever.",1381881600,4,324,4.416666666666667
4654837,5,B005CW117C,"These are 4:3 SD releases and technically it is no better than average but the acting and story line are superb. Le Carr at his best and Guinness is just perfect in the role of George Smiley. The much more expensive Blu-ray releases are only slightly better technically, this duo is excellent value.",1380067200,4,299,4.660377358490566
4654838,5,B005CW117C,"Far,far better than the new film version. Also though not mentioned by Amazon discs are not only region 2 but regions 2+4.

4654839,5,B005CW117C,"...for lovers of George Smiley.  SMILEY'S PEOPLE is more melancholy than TINKER TAILOR, more directly concerned with aging and the passing of time.  Indispensable for lovers of the character as played by Alec Guinness and very well made over all.",1359504000,2,246,5.125
4654840,1,B005CW117C,"Waited a month for delivery and received the movie The Way we Were, not what I originally ordered. Too long, too much money, and just too much hassle to return it.",1358208000,,163,4.290322580645161

DVDs arrived quickly and Cinema Cornucopia went out of their way to ensure I understood the limitations of using Region 2 dvds here in the States.  First, they sent an email and then they included a note (wrapped around the unopened dvds) to let me know that they would accept them back should I made the purchase without understanding the limitations, (provided they were returned unopened).

Bottom line, I'm very happy with my purchase and Cinema Cornucopia is a store I'd recommend to friends and family.

8465958,5,B005CW117C,"This is a Region 2 DVD set, shipped from Germany, which includes both Tinker, Tailor and Smiley's on a four DVD set, with separate cases for each, held in a large case.

For my viewing convenience, I first translated these into Region All.

The set includes the far-preferred British version of those two Le Carre works, and Tinker, Tailor is in seven parts, not six as in America. Smiley's is in six parts, but the content is quite different, and not ""dumbed down"" as the PBS versions both were. Subtitles, if selected, are in English, not German.

Of all the spy series, Tinker, Tailor and Smiley's remain my all-time faves.",1477440000,9,626,4.672727272727273

If the discs were not compatible with  American T.V.s that should have been indicated in the advertising.",1471910400,,357,4.53125
8465961,5,B005CW117C,"I have seen this BBC show a few times and I just love it.  I like it so much that I just had to purchase a copy for my video library.  The series is based on a novel covering Her Majesty's Secret Service or as they often refer to it as The Circus.  Like many BBC dramas of the period it is not a very fast paced show but it is very in depth with all it's characters.  In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, George Smiley must expose a high ranking Soviet mole in British Intelligence services.  It is a try spy story as told during the height of the cold war.  The author of the set John Le Carr has said that this is the story of how the Cambridge 5 were captured.  It really is one of the best spy stories ever told.",1471392000,,709,3.8819444444444446
