8516110,5,B005M2ATRA,"I grew up watching Ralph and Vicki on their ""Archer's Choice"" and ""Choice"" TV shows, along with some videos and DVDs from Bill Jordan and the guys at Realtree, since they had been on Realtree's Pro-Staff for years, but this video sure showed a variety of bowhunts all over the world. From Deer, Elk, Caribou, Antelope, and Bear here in North America to Plains Game and Cape Buffalo over in Africa! It even includes a sneak peak on some new products that came out in 1999. For example, when Ralph was visiting the guys at New Archer Products to discuss some of their new products, such as the Shockwave Broadhead, they wanted to keep it secret but they didn't know that Ralph had a brief case containing a hidden camera! I sure can't imagine what happened if they found out! Regardless, this is a great bowhunting video that any archer should have in his or her collection.",1514419200,,872,4.560509554140127
