Andrews Blu-ray Review: TOY STORY [1995] heralded as the first feature length film to be produced entirely on computer generated, it's the human input that makes TOY STORY work so well. A deceptively simple story 'peopled' with charming, funny, and well-realised characters and highly enjoyable fare for anyone who ever owned a toy.

It's a lovely joke that the film's toy characters are charmingly plain, especially Etch-a-Sketch, plastic soldiers, a dog made out of a Slinky, while its behind-the-scenes technology, under the inspired direction of John Lasseter, could not be more cutting edge. It's another joke that this film begins with human characters that have the flat, inexpressive look of toys. A boy named Andy is seen playing boisterously with Woody, his favourite cowboy, whose features remain innocently blank. Only after Andy gets bored and goes elsewhere does Woody spring magically to life.

With a voice supplied wonderfully by Tom Hanks, who leads this film's stellar vocal cast, Woody is instantly sympathetic. His prime spot in Andy's good graces has made him first among equals within the toy community, and Woody enjoys the perks of his power, including the attraction it holds for a Little Bo Peep doll. ""What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?"" she inquires.

But Woody gets a surprise with the opening of Andy's birthday presents, in an extended sequence that is one of the film's wonderful major marvels. The toys stage a reconnaissance mission to the living room, led by little soldiers who hide in the leaves of a houseplant as if this were a jungle. With the help of a walkie-talkie, data on the birthday gifts is relayed back to Woody, who isn't worried by Andy's new lunch box. However, Buzz Lightyear, the boastful new astronaut who takes over Woody's place on Andy's bed, is something else again. As for the rivalry between Woody and Buzz, it too keeps the film sparkling in believable ways. When Woody starts feeling competitive with this new plastic sibling and when Andy's cowboy bedspread subtly switches to an astronaut motif, it's easy to sympathise with Woody worries.

The story goes that our toys have a life of their own when we're not looking, and they form a hierarchical community where the most-played-with are the natural leaders. Sheriff Woody [Tom Hanks] currently rules the roost and ensures the smooth operation of their owner's playtime. But an early birthday gift in the shape of Buzz Lightyear [Tim Allen] is delightful deadpan and upsets this harmony when he takes Woody's coveted place on the bedspread. Things are complicated further by Buzz's conviction that he is a real space ranger, and not a battery operated plaything.

The strong cast of TOY STORY includes Tim Allen, posturing manfully as Buzz; Wallace Shawn as a neurotic dinosaur; John  Ratzenberger as a wisecracking piggy bank; Jim Varney as the Slinky dog; R. Lee Ermey as commander of the toy soldiers, and Don Rickles  as the caustic Mr. Potato Head. Randy Newman and Lyle Lovett sing a genial duet over the closing credits, and Randy Newman wrote the film's easy-going score. Thanks to exultant wit and so many distinctive voices, TOY STORY is both an aural and visual delight.

TOY STORY is a ground-breaking CGI animation and it's the top class voices which breathe life into an intelligent and witty script. Tom Hanks plays the kind of amicable all round hero that is built upon his star persona, and of course with superb support from an array of toys such as Mr Potato Head [Don Rickles], Bo Peep [Annie Potts], and Slinky Dog [Jim Varney]. Shot through with an exuberant and enviable sense of its own brilliance, TOY STORY will continue to impress long after its technical virtuosity has been upstaged. Perhaps even ""to infinity . . .  and beyond!""

PIXAR has changed the way that people watch animated films. With TOY STORY, it was the first time a generated animated film was done completely with computer graphics. The first is epic and created the franchise loved by everyone. Woody and Buzz are some of the most notable characters from any film and has nudged it way into everyones hearts. This Blu-ray contains the converted 3D presentation of this film. Since the film was originally released in 1995. It is before this new Disney Digital 3D technology existed. The conversion is really awesome and adds amazing good great depth to the computer generated animated film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  PIXAR Animation Studios brings you an upgrade of TOY STORY in this brilliant 1080p encoded image via this 3D Blu-ray of the original film and for the first time in an all-digital transfer, as well as the equally brilliant 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Given the recent nature of the clean-up, especially from the original digital files and the results are nothing short of spectacular and, just as expected, the image quality is essentially as good as a brand new computer generated film. This TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray pops out off the screen in a spectacular way with an amazing depth of field, and makes TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray a truly classic demonstration material.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again PIXAR Animation Studios brings you this TOY STORY in Disney Digital 3D Blu-ray is benefited with some tweaking with their awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio ES surround sound experience. The soundtrack exhibits the kind of surround mixes that have come to be another of the excellent PIXARs trademarks. Highly detailed, exceptionally well recorded and perfectly mixed, the PIXAR Studios relationship with George Lucas continues today through the top-end tracks produced at the Lucas Skywalker Sound studio, and you can be sure those levels are well reached here and actually surpassed. Bass separation is particularly impressive, especially in the rumbling road crossing scene in the animated film, and the intricate movements of the toys have much more clarity, even if they still don't quite call attention to themselves.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: A SPECIAL SNEAK PEEK AT TOY STORY 3: THE STORY [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:05] Here we get introduced by Lee Unkrich [Director], informing us about the new TOY STORY 3 that will complete the PIXAR trilogy. It's basically a promo to get you to view the third animated film. This is part one of the Sneak Peek promo about the 'TOY STORY' 3D Blu-ray franchise, very sneaky.

Audio Commentary: View Film with Commentary by Director John Lasseter, Co-Screenwriter Andrew Stanton, Supervising Animator Pete Docter, Art Director Ralph Eggleston, Supervising Technical Director Bill Reeves and Producers Ralph Guggenheim and Bonnie Arnold: Here we get very personal introduction with this audio commentary with the people involved with producing TOY STORY and you can view this in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround. Most of the talk at the start is just general chat about how they wanted the animated film to establish all the characters and the evolvement of the storyline. When you get to around Chapter 4 at around 6:38 minutes, where Woody is talking to all the toys, well if you look behind Woody there is a row of books and on some of the spines they read Tin Toy and knick knack to name but a few and were of course the original PIXAR animated shorts and low and behold someone comments on the in-house joke. But one annoying thing is that they say so many times that this is their favourite scene in the film, how boring [yawn] and on top of all that I felt there were far too many people doing the audio commentary, as each person sounds like they are trying to outdo each other with their personal anecdotes why they love this animated film and especially the women in this group, wow she has the most obnoxious awful voice I have heard in a very long time and somehow put me off this audio commentary. Despite this, most of the Group dive into the story, script, characters, and voice performances, animation strides in computer technology, as well as computer technical challenges, and filmmaking prowess that made the film the classic that it is today. All in all everyone says that they are very proud of their work on TOY STOY and especially as it was one of the first computer animated film and of course since then things have gone from great strides in technology and computer wizardry and improving with each year that passes. So all in all this audio commentary is okay, but again there are far too many people trying to outdo each other and also sometimes they try and talk at the same time, so in future please have less people with an audio commentary, as I do not want too many people talking vacuous comments at the same time.

Special Feature: Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Blast Off [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:27] Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs is a three-part short film series based on the Toy Story animated films. This is Part One of this fantastic little feature where Buzz Lightyear talks about his time on the International Space Station with Hamm and Rex. Each short shows Buzz Lightyear telling Rex and Hamm about his trip and how he got home in time for the events via the next two Toy Story Blu-ray discs. Buzz Lightyear is a real space ranger now.

Special Feature: Paths To PIXAR: Artists [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:49] This introduces us to a number of PIXAR veterans and the personal journeys they took before landing their roles at the PIXAR Studio. Contributors include Tia W. Kratter, Bill Wise, Sherry Callahan and Ralph Ecclestone.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: John Lasseters Car [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:28] This is one of three my favourite features of this Blu-ray release of TOY STORY and is a series of bonus features called Studio Stories. Here they recount the humble death-box car the director John Lasseter of TOY STORY drove to the PIXAR studio at the time of making the animated film. Here they talk about the really old battered car John Lasseter had, that was eventually falling to bits and so out of frustration, management eventually bought John Lasseter a brand new car. This particular short film features animated re-enactments of interesting and funny stories that took place during the making of the TOY STORY animated film. Narrated by Glenn McQueen and Darla K. Anderson.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: Baby AJ [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:40] This tells the very amusingly story of AJ Riebi and the lengths he went to in order to win the Studios Halloween costume contest, which he actually won. Narrated by AJ Riebi.

Special Feature: Studio Stories: Scooter Races [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:18] Here staff at PIXAR Studio elaborates on the famous PIXAR culture of the artists zooming around the offices at speed, and the attempts to make it around the PIXAR Studio to beat the previous record time. Narrated by Pete Doctor and Andrew Stanton.

Special Feature: Buzz Takes Manhattan [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:12] John Lasseter is in reflective retrospective where he expresses his pure joy at having a Buzz Lightyear balloon in the annual Macys Thanksgiving Parade in New York City. With location footage from the parade, and John Lasseters clear enthusiasm in being both as a parade walker and in talking head mode, its hard to resist this spot of spectacle. Contributors include John Lasseter [Chief Creative Officer for PIXAR & Disney Animation] and Roger Gould [Creative Director of PIXAR Theme Parks].

Special Feature: Black Friday: The TOY STORY You Never Saw [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:36] This is the last and most substantial of these extras, and looks back at the original version of the TOY STORY film as it was guided by the Disney executives of the 1990s. It is frank, but not so to upset those involved with the production of the animated film, but there is an interesting emphasis on how the notes that the PIXAR team received didn't really do the film justice, and how things didn't really fall into place until John Lasseter and his senior team pulled the story back from the brink of disaster and worked overtime over a two week period to present Disney with a plot and characters that really worked, and we get to sample of the film reel that led to the disastrous Black Friday screening is shown, and those with the original DVD release will get a feeling of dj vu. Contributors include John Lasseter [Chief Creative Officer for PIXAR & Disney Animation], Ed Catmull [President of PIXAR & Disney Animation] Pete Docter [Director of UP], Joe Ranft [Co-Director of CARS], Thomas Schumacher [Former president of Walt Disney Animation], Pete Schneider and Andrew Stanton [Director of WALL-E].
