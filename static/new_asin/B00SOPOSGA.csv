8699002,5,B00SOPOSGA,"I watch alot of movies made in other countries and alot of possession films, my favorite will always be the Exorcist. I know alot of people compare every exorcism film to the Exorcist but I try not to do that because none can compare. You really have to look at each individual film. Well I really enjoyed this one, even though it is another sort of found footage type. It is being played like a documentary being filmed. It is what you don't see that makes it scary. I don't want to get into to much just give it a chance and you just might enjoy it and find yourself surprised.",1515456000,,579,4.225225225225225
8699003,1,B00SOPOSGA,"The film makers let us know there has never been a film about Exorcism in Ireland, so they felt compelled to make one...not that there was any demand for bad found footage tapes of Irish exorcisms. Of course nothing says Irish like making your possessed person look like Sadako.

Lorraine (Aislinn N Uallachin) let's us know she is doing this as a post graduate project for an unnamed University. Aislinn N Uallachin looks  very good and polished narrating on camera, however her screams and whines that come later are simply annoying as was the jerk cam. Indeed, the camera work was bad for a project and at one time we get to watch the inside of the car door and air vent. Perhaps this was homage to Exorcist 2 and the air demon Pazuzu, whose name begins with the same letter as ""Poppy.""  Skipping the first 30 minutes would be time well saved. The characters themselves were never really developed as we only see them in short camera segments. What I did find interesting were the facts involving increased requests and performances of exorcisms. It is on the Internet so it must be true. Bonjour.

Now growing up I did see one exorcism performed in a Charlotte NC church. It seems a young girl got ""caught"" and claimed she was possessed by a demon. It was exorcised in about 10 minutes or so and she got her virginity and good name back. It really didn't fool anyone except for my friend Doc, who eventually married her...and divorced a year later. Not too much of a shocker there.

On top being a bad film, there is no swearing, sex, or nudity...just a PLOT SPOILER...another daddy issue.  Jeez.",1484784000,,1600,4.576923076923077
8699004,4,B00SOPOSGA,Pretty good overall and I thought it was worth the money. I was at first put off by some of the other reviews but I'm glad I watched it. The only thing I would have like more would be some more background and story about the possessed girl.,1458259200,,240,4.020833333333333
8699005,2,B00SOPOSGA,Not scary at all to tame,1441929600,,24,3.1666666666666665
8699006,1,B00SOPOSGA,I wish I had read the reviews first.  I wasted time watching it.,1440460800,,64,3.923076923076923

8699008,3,B00SOPOSGA,It was okay but i would like to have seen more scenes of the actual exorcism parts.,1428710400,,83,3.9411764705882355
8699009,3,B00SOPOSGA,"Yawn. Yet another boring entry in the exorcism genre. This one brings nothing new to the table, nothing original, no scares, no thrills. Even the backstory is the same as all the others I've seen. I definitely can't recommend this one.

That's not to say it's terrible, or poorly acted, or anything that would make it (for me) a one-star movie. It's just simply a rehashing of every other exorcism movie and there are better ones out there to spend your money on (The Last Exorcism, being one - not the sequel, however).

Anyway, it's just... meh.",1428364800,3,547,4.628865979381444
8699010,1,B00SOPOSGA,"I don't expect much from Found-footage due to movies like this; made by an obviously untalented writer/director duo that try to make a film using as little money as possible, forgetting that in order to make a good movie, you have to actually have something commonly referred to as ""talent"" (I heard that it was really important to the process). The actors were convincing enough, and the script wasn't entirely bad, but so many little directorial decisions made this movie incredibly taxing; it was tediously slow, nothing much happens until the very end, and once it does, it's over. Literally, there is no transition between acts 2 and 3. It simply goes into act 2, and then it ends. The people responsible for this movie (aside for the actors) should be forced to attend film school, watch some movies that are actual works of art, and take careful notes. What they are doing now will not get them far in the business.  A complete and utter waste of time.",1428278400,,959,4.674556213017752
