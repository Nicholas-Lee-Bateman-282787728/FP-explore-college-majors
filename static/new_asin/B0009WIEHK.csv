8068566,3,B0009WIEHK,"I rented this and I am glad I didn't buy it. Ignore the packaging and the little detail that this movie is from the people who were behind ""Phone"" -(go get it!) This movie is NOT at all like ""Phone"". You can see similarities where the formula worked then and they tried to go with the same thing again, the double bad character attempt, the leave something out and find out later attempt, but it just didn't cut it here. (I am being vague as to not ruin Phone for anyone who hasn't seen it)

The story...A dead girl opens her eyes in the morgue- cut to 2 years later. A girl comes back from a two year stay in the U.S to visit one of her old friends, part of a group of 5 that don't see each other anymore, that have moved on with their lives. She talks about a ghost stalking her- a girl they knew. Ultimately, people in the group start dying and we find out it was because of a girl they knew that killed herself that they went their seperate ways. Is it the ghost terrorizing them? One of the group? And why? It is compelling in the beginning to middle, but doesn't quite make a strong dash to the end. Don't expect a normal ending either.",1123372800,3,1142,4.121076233183857
