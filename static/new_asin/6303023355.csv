544180,3,6303023355,Gene Hackman has made a career out of great roles.  Everything from The Posedion Adventure to Hoosiers.  Maybe some of the movies wouldn't be considered classics.  But most of them were big box office and kept you watching them.  And along the way he won two Oscars.  Bat 21 is one of those roles.  Reading other reviews I didn't know that alot of this isn't really the way it happened.  But until not knowing that.  I thought this movie was very exciting and suspensful.  He plays Lt. Col going aalong on a mission when his helicopter gets shot down.  After a couple of days of waiting to get get rescued he decides to go on his own.  An avid golfer he uses terms from golf as code.  Along the way he has to fight a civillian among other things.  Danny Glover and Jerry Reed are also very good in this as well.  I read it was Jerry Reed's idea to make this movie.  If you take this movie for what it is.  A Hollywood movie of a true event  It is very good.  And when did Hollywood ever get a true story right any way.  Remember Bonnie And Clyde.,1477699200,,1046,4.165829145728643

I just wish that we would uphold these men and give them the praise they duly deserve. Our present government is degrading our military forces and think it is ok to call our country names. It downgrades America , the America which has always been able to lift its head high and state proudly that we are the home of the free and land of the brave. God bless America!  America is great. It has to get back to loving God and keeping holy in our Faith and respect for the things that God has called mankind to do. May God have mercy on this country and bring it back to the days when men were men of faith and strength because they loved God, dignity, purity and a high standard of living  and women who loved to be women and not men. Women who loved to be the mothers of brave and righteous men and women to live lives that were worth more than the infamy our lives have taken this nation today.",1445040000,,1047,4.152709359605911

544451,4,6303023355,"Gene Hackman and Danny Glover star in this air action drama set in the Vietnam war epoch.  Having read some of the reviews, positive and negative, I will say that the film, whether 100% accurate or not, is a riveting drama.  Bat 21 is a perfect follow-up for you if you like Air America or any of the other Vietnam great films (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, etc.)
Gene Hackman plays a specialist who goes out in the field by air and is brought down by enemy action.  Suddenly, the war is not an intellectual pursuit for Hackman but is tangible; he has to fend for himself: evade the enemy and contact our forces to arrange a rescue (evacuation).  It's touch and go whether he can make it out and you really experience how narrow an escape it will be...if he makes it home.",1441324800,,767,4.380281690140845

Gene and Danny makes this something to watch and not forgotten to soon. Actors are fantastic bringing this to realistic proportions that the feeling is there touching out for help. Based on a true story of an officer in a plane who gets shot down in Vietnam and now they have got to retrieve him and bring him home as he holds a lot of information. The pick up points are made but certain things are rising up and the mission is in jeopardy if they try to get to him. At the finish the rescuers are also in peril. The action is fast and thrills by the minute waiting for what is next that's coming at you around the corner, you won't be disappointed with this full on moving show even a marvellous classic like this should be in your collection. Don't take my word as I like a huge range of shows, now try to relax and complete your mission of watching this fabulous movie with munchies by your side and remote in your hand.

Danny Glover plays USAF CPT Bart Clark, pilot of the single engine OV-10 Forward Observation Control aircraft.  Through Clark's tireless efforts he manages to direct Hambleton through the dense jungle of Vietnam to eventual safety using the distances of various holes from golf courses both have played.

544746,5,6303023355,"Bat 21 is an excellent story about the truth life shoot down and rescue of  Lieutenant Colonel Iceal E. ""Gene"" Hambleton, the sole survivor of an USAF EB-66B Destroyer electronic warfare aircraft. Portions of the film were highly dramatized, including the climactic battle. Some characters were composites of real people, while others were created for the film. However, some other details were accurate, including the fact that Captain Larry Potts was of African American ancestry.

With all of that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys war movies or want to learn something about the Vietnam War and LtCol. Hambleton's and rescuers ""code talk"" that helped lead to the rescue of Hambleton.

The actual rescue took over eleven days, during which a major attack was delayed, resulting in numerous South Vietnamese soldiers being killed and wounded. Several attempts were made to recover Hambleton. Two helicopters were lost and members of its crews were killed or captured. A Forward Air Observer aircraft was shot down and USAF 1Lt Bruce Walker and USMC 1Lt Larry Potts parachuted to the ground safely, eluding capture. In an ensuing attack, six more Americans lost their lives attempting to rescue him. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the intense efforts to find the flyer, increased their efforts to find Hambleton. Walker was discovered and killed by the Vietnamese forces. Hambleton was finally rescued in a land operation by U.S. Navy SEAL Lt. j.g Thomas R. Norris and VNN Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet during a night-time, covert operation from more than 2 miles (3.2 km) behind enemy lines.",1415923200,7,1631,5.12406015037594

Recently, I happened to meet the sister of the actual pilot of Jolly Green 67, Capt. Peter H. Chapman II. She didn't tell me much of her brother's story, or of the entire rescue attempt, but what she told me made me curious, and I researched the incident and the role her brother played in it. I know that Hollywood condenses and changes stories to suit their intentions, but I felt that this movie strayed too far from the actual historic events - which, frankly, would have made a more gripping film than this one. I was very disappointed in the way that the Jolly Green crew's story was portrayed in the movie, so differently from the tragic historical reality. I thought the way the film portrayed the pilot, even in this fictionalized way, was terribly disrespectful to the memory of Capt. Chapman and his crew.

This film is typical Hollywood fare, nothing more, nothing less. I would not recommend it for anyone wanting to know any actual history about the Vietnam War in general, or this incident in particular. And I would think that even if a person were looking for movies that depict the human aspect of the conflict, stories of bravery, or the horror of war, they could find a better example than this too-fictionalized telling of a truly heroic piece of history.",1354579200,,1474,4.604562737642586

545083,3,6303023355,"Lt. Col. Iceal Hambelton was an Air Force Officer, and an expert in electronic-warfare and ballistic missiles. He had been involved in several missile development programs and other vital aspects of technology. Needless to say, he had a Top Secret security clearance.

Serving on an electonic-warfare plane as navigator, he was the only survivor when he parachuted over Quang Tri province, deep in North Veitnamese territory. In fact, he landed in the midst of a massive NVA ofgfensive, and the attempts to rescue Hambelton were truly epic. Five U.S. aircraft were destroyed, and nine severely damaged. Eleven airmen were killed in action, and two were captured.

Bat21 is a highly FICTIONALIZED account of the historical event. Gene hackman plays Lt. Col. hambelton in this portrayal of the incident. Danny Glover plays Captain Clark, ...an entirely FICTIONAL character, who ultimately rescues the stranded colonel. In REALITY, ...Lt. Col. Hambelton was rescued by a Navy SEAL, Lt. J.G. Norris and ARVN Commando Nguyen Van Kiet.

Despite the enormous Hollywood deviations from reality and the HISTORICAL FACTS, this is not a bad movie. The character of Captain Clark, although fictional, is truly notable as relentless forward air control pilot in a Cessna Skymaster, ...who never gives up in his attempts to guide the downed airman out of harms's way. Like a REAL AMERICAN, Clark never gives up in this attempt. Unfortunately, it is someone like Danny Glover in this role, but he did a good job. I was greatly disappointed to find that this part of the story never happened!

For what its worth, I think this film does a good job of portraying the truest character of American servicemen who bravely risked their lives in Veitnam. It also accurately portrays the REAL brutality of the communist NVA troops.

Some other flagrant deviations from reality:
-Hambelton and Clark engaging in long conversations, ...on the RADIO, INA COMBAT ZONE!!! (as if they were on the telephone)! There are scenes of an NVA communications team listening in on the transmissions. SURELY an electronic-warfare officer would be AWARE of that, ...and the inevitable triangulation from RDF!

...and a factual observation:
It is noted in the film, that the NVA already has a large file on Lt. Col. Hamblen. Its true. How did this come to be?
...While REAL Americans were fighting and serving in Veitnam, ....their were leftists on various American university campuses, who were ASSEMBLING RESEARCH ON DEPLOYED AMERICAN SERVICE-MEMBERS. THIS DATA WAS SUBMITED TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF NORTH VEITNAM, THE U.S.S.R., AND THE ""PEOPLES"" REPUBLIC OF CHINA!",1306627200,4,2623,5.1891252955082745

I found the movie, Bat-21, full of vile profanity, at the most mundane, non-emotional scenes, an insult to the real airmen involved in this saga and all military members past and present. Once again, Hollywood, having a sorry adaptation of the real book, even worse script writers, falls back on cursing as scene fillers.
The acting....wasn't.  The so-called story line is truly fantasy from Hollywood at its worst. It is obvious that the entire group involved in the making of this fiasco have no concept of the military, the Vietnam War, flying, military communications discipline, and for certain never read the book about this real-life heroic drama.
Gene Hackman tramps over hill and dale in broad daylight, on a treeless hill-top fully visible to the enemy, crashes through the boonies like a male rhino in heat, leaving a broken vegetation trail that a Tenderfoot Boy Scout could follow, and in general, appears clueless about escape and evasion.
The extremely long-winded radio transmissions between Hackman and Glover (in an OV-2 flying overhead), was more suitable for a conversation on a back porch swing than would ever transpire in a search/rescue/escape and evasion situation.  Pure bull crap!!
Read the book!  Don't buy, don't rent, don't even consider watching this most sorry excuse for a war movie.  I just wasted nearly $14 (with S/H) buying the DVD.  The Wizard of Oz, Spiderman, I, II and III are more believable than this fiasco.",1296518400,5,1659,4.9496402877697845

While creating a bond of friendship with ""Bird Dog"", a pilot that's watching out for him, and guiding him to a safe rescue (played by Danny Glover), he sees war from a different perspective than he's used to seeing it; from the ground. He learns about himself, and it changes him...""I'm through with killin'"" says Gene Hackman, is one of my favorite quotes.

My only negative for this flick is it's too short.  I would've preferred more scenes where Gene Hackman was performing ground-controller duties against the VC or NVA, and more aerial footage of the environment in which he and his crew members got shot down.

Overall, it's a great flick that helps promote the Air Force and the circumstances our flight crews can go thru during combat, especially when they are shot down.",1169337600,,711,4.747967479674797

Hackman knows that the area he is in is due to be carpet bombed in a few days and he has to get out of there. The problem is that the VC are listening in on the radio and that makes planning problematical until golf proves to be a useful escape tool. Hackman knows the layouts of the world's military golf courses like the back of his hand and comes up with a code using golf terms and the layout of well known military courses to let the rescuers know how to keep up with him.

When a surface-to-air missile hits the plane, Col. Hambleton is the only man able to eject from the aircraft, landing in the northern portion of South Viet Nam.  For the next eleven and a half days Col. Hambleton evaded capture by the North Vietnamese Army until he was rescued in one of the largest and most complex rescue missions of the Viet Nam War.  These true events, for which 234 medals were awarded, inspired this movie.

In the movie Col. Hambleton is nearing possible rescue by a Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopter when Viet Cong destroy the helicopter.  The Viet Cong, who are using the people of a nearby village to protect themselves from American attack since the Viet Cong know that Americans typically attempt to protect non-combatants, kill all the crew.  However, this time the rage of Col. George Walker (Jerry Reed, in one of his best roles) causes the village to be destroyed by napalm bombs.

Col. Hambleton is on the run for his life, both from the North Vietnamese Army and from an impending air strike by B-52 bombers.  Using the call sign Bat-21 and his URC-64 survival radio, Hambleton follows directions from forward air controller Captain Bartholomew Clark along a path based on golf courses that Col. Hambleton has played.

What I find amazing about this movie is that while there are events that illustrate the tragedy and inhumanity of the combat in Viet Nam, much of the movie focuses on the people in the movie.  There is a touching moment where Col. Hambleton passes a boy on a bridge, and the two exchange gifts, forgetting for a moment the ideologically generated conflict going on around them.  It is also apparent to me that Col. Hambleton had nothing against the Vietnamese people; he was just a soldier with a job to do.

Movies typically do a poor job portraying any war or combat, with few exceptions.  Similarly, this movie misses much with respect to the true story.  This movie also invents things that never happened, or misrepresents other events, likely all for the sake of pace and action.  However, this movie does catch the spirit of one man surviving incredible odds in war to not only do his job, which was to fight an enemy, but to get himself rescued in the process.  From that viewpoint this movie is a winner.",1130371200,42,2438,4.739336492890995

545215,4,6303023355,"High octane action and the perseverance of some of the leads elevate ""Bat-21"" to that higher level of Vietnam movie.  Basically the story of how a high-level intelligence officer eludes capture after being shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam, ""Bat-21"" is relentless and never exploitative.  Hackman is Iceal Hambleton, a USAF colonel who fights the war in Vietnam from the offices and golf courses of Saigon.  Tasked to identify communist missile sites, he boldly (and unwisely) tags along on an EB-66, an unarmed electronic warfare bird loaded with intelligence equipment.  The sole survivor after being shot down, Hambleton finds himself pursued by the enemy who apparently appreciate his value as a prisoner.  While the enemy (was it the NVA or the Cong? I could never tell) is unable to find Hambleton, they prove more than capable of making life hell for the rescue choppers sent to rescue him - including the crew of a ""Jolly Green"" cut to pieces over an enemy-held village.  While on the ground, Hambleton stays in contact with Bart Clark (Danny Glover), a USAF captain who flies spotter missions for more heavily armed bombers.  (Clark flies FAC - from his slow-moving Cessna, he finds targets for the strike fighters, marking them with white-phosphorous rockets).  Knowing that the enemy is monitoring them, Hambleton and Clark work out a code that posits the map of Vietnam as a big golf course.  As rescue attempts become more dangerous, Clark finds himself drawn ever deeper into the rescue, climaxing in his going rogue when his superiors throw in the towel.
""Bat-21"" isn't really a classic.  There's plenty of thrilling action, and the script even manages to find room for irony (as when Clark pauses during a radio conversation with Hambleton while he zaps a few communist troops).  Still, nothing really convincingly explains how Hackman manages to elude capture...by anybody (the script makes clear that he is definitely no Rambo).  The film also breezes over the biggest irony - that Hackman's code is based on his smarts on the golf course rather than the battlefield.  If the film excels over cheap action flicks, it's in the determination and exhaustion of its leads and persistent refusal to avoid Hollywood glory.  Also, unless anybody knows of another film, this is the only one I've seen that captures the critical role played by Forward Air Controllers in both prosecuting the air war in Vietnam, and rescuing those airmen nearly lost.",1069200000,3,2465,5.024570024570025
545216,5,6303023355,This film encompases the realism a Vietnam Veteran wants in a film centered on/in that war.  the films actors dedication to self portrayals of those who were there while fighting against all odds for those in need and under fire is accurate.  Danny Glover portrays the honest truth of character that most men had within themselves while there.  I remembered my own dedication to my country and its best beliefs while watching the film.

545218,4,6303023355,"Perhaps, like me, you've come here after watching ""Behind Enemy Lines"" featuring Owen Wilson and, of course, Gene Hackman, who happens to star in this underrated film.  Okay, the plot is almost the same as that action filck made with the technology of the year 2001, but, let me tell you, ""BAT*21"" gives its stress on a different matter than ""Behind,"" and that is the characters played by the two leads.
As the film claims in the opening, the story about Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton whose airplane is shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam is based on truth.  Now becoming ""BAT*21,"" his code name, he has to rely on a radio by which he maintains a contact with a pilot Captain Bartholomew Clerk (Danny Glover), who instructs and encourages him to overcome all the barriers waiting for him on the ground.  But Lieutenant Colonel has no previous combat experience in his career, and the time for massive air raid that is certain to kill him is coming closer.
Frankly, some of the scenes are too incredible (especially when Captain tries to fly the helicopter, which he has not done for a long time).  And you cannot expect the high-octaine action sequences, because the film's real focus is set in other places; that is, the bond between the two leading characters, which develops gradually through the unreliable radio contact.  Precisely this human part is the greatest asset of ""BAT*21"" of which quality is raised by the extremely superb acting by Gene  Hackman.  He is, as usual with any first-rate actor you name, the real energy with his depiction of toughness and frailty, and his powerhouse performance lifts this sometimes clithed film to the above-average level among many other ones about this war.",1019174400,38,1715,4.852739726027397

7835824,3,6303023355,"Having flown this same mission into NV I knew what I had to be prepared for. This crew in the movie seems to be not paying attention as to what their job was. When I flew this mission, myself and my crew were silent and no talking about lawn furniture. I was in radio contact with a navy ship who kept me advised to the migs that were coming my way. Also my ECM operator was busy jamming radar and I was busy avoiding missiles sent my way. Needless to say we survived because we were alert and prepared and not talking about retirement. This is why I give it three stars, it simply is not an accurate representation. Of the 100 missions I flew out of Takhli I cannot remember any verbal chatter other than what was related to the mission. If in fact this is what happened, then this would explain why they got shot down.",1522800000,,820,4.19620253164557
