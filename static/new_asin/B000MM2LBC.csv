8169987,4,B000MM2LBC,"Production Quality: This is a VHS production that has simply been made into a dvd, nothing more.

But if you're thinking about buying it, it's because you want to see these 2 actors having a good time talking about the Good Ol' Days.  And that is what this dvd is!

If there's a flaw (with the content) it's that it feels too short.  The anecdotes are fun and funny, and the chemistry between these two men is wonderful!  I recommend any Trekkie or Trekker snatch this up if you can, because it's a wonderful snapshot into part of who the men behind Spock and Captain James Tiberius Kirk are.  (And what a lovely snapshot!)

P. S. If you watch this and still want more, I highly recommend buying Shatner's 2 autobiographical books Star Trek Memories and Star Trek Movie Memories!",1175385600,2,779,4.521428571428571
