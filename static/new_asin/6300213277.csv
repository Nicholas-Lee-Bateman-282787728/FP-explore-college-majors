7806202,5,6300213277,The old war by computer theme is played out here.  Instead of fighting a war with weapons; this planet has it's citizens stepping in booths for execution.  The machine decides who lives and who dies.  Kirk of course ends it all with one of his talks with the Vedikarians. With one sweep of his phaser the natives have to fight the old fashioned way.... with futuristic weapons of mass destruction. The Federation again paves the way for peaceful resolutions to conflict. Only this war will last a few hundred years before they actually become citizens of the Federation.,1041379200,,570,4.795918367346939
7806203,5,6300213277,"One of the fun things about science fiction is that you can take things to their logical albeit extreme conclusions.  That is what the Enterprise encounters on Eminiar VII in ""A Taste of Armageddon,"" a planet that has been at war for five centuries but which fails to show the usual signs of destruction.  This is because they have been fighting the war with computers; after such an attack Anan 7, leader of the High Council announces that half a million people were ""killed,"" and now have to report to disintegration chambers.  Unfortunately the Enterprise, which was warned not to approach the planet, has also been destroyed and Kirk's crew needs to beam down for disintegration.  Of course, Kirk takes exception to this request and decides to remind these people of the true face of war.  As far fetched as this idea might be, you have to remember the idea of the Neutron Bomb, which would kill the people but leave the buildings, a weapon that was ironically considered by some to be more ""humane"" than your traditional nuclear device.  Kirk's efforts to restore sanity are hampered by the presence of Federation Ambassador Fox, who wants to stick to the traditional diplomatic approaches despite the fact nobody on the planet is impressed at all by such delicacies.  ""A Taste of Armageddon"" is another, albeit minor example, of Captain Kirk versus the Super Computer plotline that was so prominent in Star Trek's first season.",1002844800,,1433,4.872427983539095
7806204,4,6300213277,"What if war were fought with computers and the casualties reported to disintegration chambers? This episode covers this question and does a pretty good job.
There is a fair amount of action and the suspense is well done. The conflict between Scotty and the none-too-bright diplomat is especially well handled. This is one of Scotty's best command assignments. He runs the Enterprise with intelligence and restraint.
Kirk's solution to the episode's problem is very suspect in light of the prime directive that he's supposed to be following, but over-all, this is a very good episode.",997660800,2,583,5.147368421052631
7806205,3,6300213277,"Kirk has fun breaking the prime directive and blows up the planet's computers. Spock has several good moments, including ""Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder"" Scotty does well to  keep the diplomat in line.",939859200,,233,5.297297297297297
