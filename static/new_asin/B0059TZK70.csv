8463020,5,B0059TZK70,Great DVD.  Loved being able to watch both stories on here.  It's hard to find DVD's that cover the prophets and keep the kids interested.  This did both.,1495497600,,154,4.428571428571429
8463021,2,B0059TZK70,"These movies are loosely based on Scripture with much added for dramatic effect, the movie Solomon being the worse offender.  It seems to focus more on Solomon's personal relationships with women rather than his position as the King of Israel and weakens him to a ludicrous degree.  He seems to be first under the dominon of his mother until her death and then under the dominion of his wives.  Of course, we know that in the Scriptures, Solomon's heart was turned away from God by his idol worshipping wives and this movie portrays that but the entire buildup of the theme of this movie is to find meaning behind Solomon's fall rather than his many triumphs.  He spends most of his time in bed with his wives or talking about his wives, or cyring over his wives.  Even the consecrating of the Temple is of little importance in this movie and the great prayer Solomon prayed to God for Israel is cut to a few short lines.  In the movie, he falls in love with the Queen of Sheba and they marry and have a son.  Solomon wants to place their son on the throne instead of Rehoboam but the High Priest refuses and Solomon starts crying and the Queen of Sheba decides to leave and go back to her own country with their son and he becomes King of Sheba.  It's ridiculous.  Jeroboam is completely out of character, leaving Solomon's employ because Solomon is turning away from God to the idols of his wives.  He waxes on and on about how Solomon is leading Israel to disaster because of his betrayal of God.  According to Scripture, Jeroboam was a far worse offender and God finally sent a prophet to Jeroboam proclaiming that because of his evil ways he would die and his name would be cut off.  Of course the prophecy came true.  I could say more but I think that's enough to show that the movie is only very loosely based on Scripture (they did get the names right!)

The movie Jeremiah isn't as bad but still adds much that isn't necessary.  Of course, we know from Scripture that Jeremiah was forbidden by God to marry so the movie makes this into a grand theme by having him fall in love with a Jewish woman who then sacrifices her life to save his . . .  Jeremiah's relationship with God and the prophecies by which he forewarned Israel of their fate are a confused jumble mixed in with the romantic storyline.

So, I don't recommend this movie if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Scripture.  I don't even recommend the movies as pure fiction either since, in that regard, they're rather boring.  I won't be watching them again, it was a waste of money.",1455580800,3,2563,4.449678800856531
