8033253,1,B0002V7OF6,Is this really 350.00??? Is it covered in gold? I cannot believe it would be this much. I hope it is a misprint.,1386115200,,112,3.9130434782608696
8033254,3,B0002V7OF6,"I just got this and it doesn't have the Godzilla 2000 Special Edition.  Just the regular English dub.  It seems like everyone was saying that the 2000 dub/sub would be in here, so I'm wondering where the misinformation originated.  The only saving grace is the 3 oldies with the original Japanese track.",1098230400,4,303,4.788461538461538
8033255,5,B0002V7OF6,"It may not contain a Japanese/English Special Edition of Godzilla 2000.  According to some early reports, this is the same English-only DVD released a few years ago.  So, don't buy the box unless you don't any of the films and you also want the U.S Godzilla.",1098144000,8,258,4.586956521739131
8033256,4,B0002V7OF6,this set is a good set because it has three dvds i don't have and also apparently godzilla 2000 is a new special edition with the japanese version on the other side of the disc!  unfortunately those are joined by the worst godzilla film of them all the american godzilla.  a dvd that most huge godzilla fans already own like me and that casual fans don't want to own.  unfortunately us huge fans may be forced to buy this because of the godzilla 2000 dvd.  there is no place i can find to order this seperately so i am very afraid that i will have to buy this.  this is a problem because of the cost and also i want to ask for the godzilla dvds for christmas but no one will buy me a five disc set for christmas.  its to expensive.  so please tristar release the special edition of godzilla 2000 seperataley.  just because you have a bunch of extra copies of your bad movie doesn't meen we should have to buy it to get a good movie. UPDATE 10/18/04 the godzilla 2000 disc will NOT have the japanese cut!  I recommend this to nobody unless you don't have any of these discs buy the new ones seperately and don't encourage Sony's lies about what is on the dvd's consider my review a one star now.,1093305600,14,1194,4.201754385964913
