1787233,5,B00006RCQE,I have just about every Richard Simmons sweating tape and needed the challenge of the speed and rhythms of the Latin beat to reach my target heart rate.,1230076800,3,152,4.464285714285714
1787234,1,B00006RCQE,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. I like Richard Simmons, but this was a dud. I was also very upset that because I opened it, I am not able to return it for a refund. This makes no sense, how are you suppose to know you like an exercise video if you do not open it and watch it. This is not a friendly rule to customers of Amzon.",1200268800,4,339,3.857142857142857
1787235,5,B00006RCQE,"As a Hispanic, I thought the music could have been better but the video is still worth it. My mom has been a fan of Richard Simmons for yrs (and even met him!). I've been lacking on cardio and the gym at the University here is always packed from noon 'til midnight. I didn't know Richard Simmons had other tapes besides Sweatin' to the Oldies (still great!) and was thrilled to find this! The moves r hard to follow until u get the hang of it but I worked up a real sweat trying. The background dancers r great and they make Richard look like the odd white guy in a Latin club knowing the moves but without the natural Latin flair (which I suppose he is). I think I burned calories just laughing. It's definitely worth the buy!",1111881600,5,727,4.237410071942446
1787236,4,B00006RCQE,"I have just finished my first attempt with this routine.  Sure, the dance steps were a bit hard to get down, so I just did my best to mimic the first time, but what fun.  There are real dancers in Latin costume, and because the men were in pants and the women in dresses, I could see their legs well enough to see the dances.  It was easier to learn than when I first tried the Richard Simmons Dance Your Pants Off.  I had so much fun, that I didn't realize I was sweating until the cool down.  The routine went fast too, because of the fun.  Don't let the dance steps discourage you, just do your best and you'll be dancing away in no time.  These dancing excercise tapes have been better than just a way to excercise.  I have become better coordinated, more graceful, and learned dance steps, too.",1094515200,8,799,4.245033112582782
1787237,3,B00006RCQE,"I own several Richard Simmons tapes, and this is definitely my LEAST favorite.  In some other reviews, people mentioned that the camera work was great.  I strongly disagree with this.  For some other type of video, it would be, but this is an EXERCISE video.  You need to be able to see the people's feet/full body when they introduce a new step.  However, the editor of this video often cuts to shots of people's muscles, faces, etc. at this critical time.  I am usually very good at picking up aerobics moves, but I have trouble with this video because of the showy but poorly thought-out editing.  Unlike others, I like the toning section (get Simmons cool weights!) but I agree that it is not enormously effective/strenuous.  However, I think it helps to get your muscles ready for more effective toning later down the line.  This section and the music are the main things I like about the video.  However, if you are looking for an easier and more fun tape, get Disco Blast-Off, which I highly recommend.",1090800000,2,1009,4.649717514124294
1787238,1,B00006RCQE,"I've been doing workout videos for years, so its not like I haven't had experience with these things.  But this video is ridiculous.  The eclectic and dizzying mix of moves from the first 10 minutes was enough for me to throw my hands up and laugh.  I don't think they repeat a single move more than twice in this entire video.
They spent way too much time designing fancy Latin backdrops, strobe lights & black&white disco cinematography.  Not to mention the laughable scantily-clad Latin chicks that sit along the sidelines and whistle at those sweating and rump-shaking in the video.  A little more time needed to be spent designing a routine that was actually feasible to accomplish.  If you're looking for a GOOD Richard Simmons tape, I'd recommend the Mega-Mix Blastoff.  It's a lot easier to follow and a LOT less cornball.  But if you're looking for a good laugh, pick this up today!",1074470400,6,891,4.740259740259741
1787239,3,B00006RCQE,"I love Richard Simmons and Latin music, so this video had a headstart with me. The production looks terrific--excellent camera work here, which is unusual for exercise videos. Yet is this really an exercise video? Sort of. Richard himself sticks to the usual low-impact aerobic moves, which is helpful if you're not a dancer.
The rest of the cast, though, goes for sexy, wiggly variations and look like they're on the dance floor, not in the gym. Fun? Yeah--dance along with them. But if you're looking for a good instructional video, this isn't it.
Also, the toning portion requires wrist weights, which isn't mentioned at all in the tape or on the box. How heavy should they be? Who knows. I wish Richard would talk to the viewer in the video about using such weights or substituting others. Most of the toning exercises (top half only) don't seem suitable for weights, and Richard gives no instruction on form--no info about bending your knees, posture, etc. This surprises me, since his ""Sweatin' to the Oldies 2"" is quite good on this score, and far more comprehensive. In ""Latin Blast,"" Richard ends by saying, ""Now you're toned."" Um, no, not from this tape!
I recommend and use this tape only occasionally. It's good for when I'm bored with the gym-style tapes and feel like jiggling to jazzy music with a strong beat.",1042934400,9,1325,4.765217391304348
1787240,3,B00006RCQE,"I loved the music in this video, but just could not get the moves down.  I am familiar with Richard Simmons workouts and know that he does not cue very often, but these moves were more advanced then what he usually does.  I'm sure that after a few times I'll get the moves down, but it was just frustrating to try to keep up when you had no idea what was coming next.
The toning section is a joke, he goes too fast and makes the moves two big, so you risk getting injured. I only got through a few minutes of the toning before turning it off and the next day my upper back was killing me from doing large arm circles with weights (which shouldn't be done!).
I wouldn't recommend this tape for anyone who feels uncoordinated, I'm a dancer and I still couldn't figure out the moves the first time!",1040256000,3,795,4.189542483660131
1787243,2,B00006RCQE,"I love my richard simmons and have 4 other DVD's however, the Latin Simmons left me a little sad. Richard didn't seem to give a lot of instruction and at some points in the workout seemed like he was lost. I also would have liked it too be longer. now don't get me wrong it's a nice workout however, it is not up to par with his other DVD's. if you just want something fun to do then this would be a CD for you but, if you really want to work out I would pass this 1 up.",1360195200,4,470,3.757575757575758
1787244,5,B00006RCQE,A little variety adds to the spice of life and this latin beat is just the answer to lose weight. Ole!,1359849600,,102,3.9047619047619047
1787245,4,B00006RCQE,I tired will again soon . maybe when get some others down and more confindent . i liked but got to get better to keep up to some honestly lol.,1342915200,,142,3.7666666666666666
1787246,1,B00006RCQE,"Although I'm generally a fan of Richard Simmons' workouts, I was very disappointed with this one.  The moves are more complicated than those of his other workouts, so I often had to make up my own moves to the music instead of keeping up with Richard. Like another reviewer said, I think that the other participants are likely professional dancers rather than regular people. I also did not like the ""matador"" moves with the scarves. The only positive thing I can say is that I like the music.  One thing to note is that the aerobics part takes roughly 29 minutes, and then there is a weight training segment. If you stop after the cooldown, you'll miss that part.",1310774400,8,664,4.571428571428571
1787247,5,B00006RCQE,"I want to address a rather negative review that accused this of not being an exercise workout...I lost 40 pounds and 5 dress sizes dancing to this thing...matter of fact I was afraid of something happening to my old VHS and wanted a DVD to make sure I never lost it...the moves are fluid and fun, and they are teachable...each set of the workout deals with a different area of the body in specific motions...so much fun you do not realize you are ""exercising"", which is precisely why I love it.  The dance sequence works the traps and the humorous and for balance and flexibility...this is a GREAT little gem and will remain my fave.  By the way, I am 62 now, and started dancing to this in my late 50's...so OLA!",1302048000,6,713,4.393939393939394
1787248,5,B00006RCQE,"I happened upon this video at a thrift store and bought it.  I had never seen a Richard Simmons workout before but was always curious.  This video was fun to work out to and extremely fun to watch, especially with the good looking male dancers. I have since purchased several other of Richards videos and love them all.  This one will always be my favorite. And I was glad to purchase it here in DVD form after using the thrift store VHS so much.",1300406400,3,446,4.285714285714286
1787249,4,B00006RCQE,"I like this one, in fact it is my 4th favorite, after the 1st and 3rd Sweating to the Oldies, and the 80's Blast Off.  It is not like his other DVD's, it has more dance moves in it, but I found it to be a bit sexier, my hubby likes to watch me do this one!",1298764800,3,256,3.491228070175439
1787250,1,B00006RCQE,"I had bought this a while ago and just happened to notice it on Amazon.  I have a number of Richard Simmons videos, but this is the absolute worst one in terms of exercise.  This is the only one that I can say I think Richard ""cheated"" and actually got Latin dancers, instead of average exercisers.  Ballroom dancing was my hobby for a long while, so I think I know a dancer versus an average exerciser.

The average person would NOT be able to catch on to these movements without training--in fact Richard appeared to be having problems most of the time and they actually showed him only for very brief stretches.  And then there were the moments where Richard was seen using a piece of cloth like matador in kind of a dream-like state.  This was truly more like a music video than an exercise video.

Some of the male dancers were very good looking and moved well, so to my point again, if you like watching Latin dance...but definitely not conducive to exercising to.",1264896000,4,970,4.4772727272727275
1787251,1,B00006RCQE,"I bought this tape recently and threw it out after watching and attempting the first few routines/dances. Richard Simmons spends more time trying to attract the attention of or look as sexy as the male dancers than he does giving solid exercise instruction (instruction? What instruction???).

The music isn't particularly good and the visuals are cluttered with too many people attempting too many individual moves. Anyone trying to exercise to the video had better have a solid understanding of how to exercise safely, since you don't get that from Richard Simmons. The video lacks his usual empathetic encouragement, and the moves aren't explained or user-friendly for the typical home exerciser.

Worse, the sexual gyrations in this video are inappropriate and idiotic. I doubt anyone is going to mistake Richard Simmons for a Latin lover, so why have various women rub up against him suggestively? What's the point? How does this help any of us get fit?

I'm sorry I wasted my money, but by tossing the video in the trash maybe I saved someone else from doing the same.",1258502400,,1074,4.988826815642458
1787252,5,B00006RCQE,It's great.  Nothing like he's ever really done before.  Makes you feel like your at a Latin dance club.,1234483200,,104,4.421052631578948
7972422,5,B00006RCQE,"This arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It's a little hard to follow, even if you're familiar with Richard's moves. Probably won't be one of my favorites, but it's something different anyway.",1492387200,,200,5.28125

7972430,5,B00006RCQE,"Just love this workout! If you have lost some weight & want to step your workout up a notch, this is it! I went from a size 18 to a Size 2 in 6 months with this workout out along with using the old step bench workout.
This is fast paced but so much fun! Even if you can't do all the moves just keep moving & have fun.
There is light weights involved after the cardio.
This is the best! Went though 2 VHS tapes and now have it on DVD .",1397347200,,434,3.6774193548387095
