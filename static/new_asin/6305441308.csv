7889262,3,6305441308,"The movie was a complete spoof,nothing made any sense but I did like some of the big name stars making fun at themselves.and the fact that the credits said one star was in the movie and never was,was borderline insulting.",1276473600,,221,4.55
7889263,3,6305441308,"THE MISERY BROTHERS is the concoction of writer/director/actor Lorenzo Doumani, and he even uses his actress wife, Brenda.  I first came upon them with the well done, if uneven, horror spoof BUG BUSTER.
This really corny and derivative comedy spoofs everything from JFK and Marilyn Monroe to ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The Godfather.""
Most of the jokes miss horribly, but there at least a half dozen that really work well.  Doumani and veteran character actor Leo Rossi play the Misery brothers, who stand to inherit 200 million dollars from their gangster fathers estate IF they do two things:  not get arrested for any felonies for at least a year; and secondly, get married within that year.  If they don't the money will go to Rev Scheister's Second Son of Christ church.  You know from here what will happen.  But it doesn't really matter as the movie is simply a vehicle for over the hill actors to have fun.  For example:
ABE VIGODA plays the gangster dad, Don Frito Layleone, head of the huge food chain syndicate.
PAT MORITA appears as Judge Ben E Hana, who serves justice with a variety of culinary weapons.
DR. JOYCE BROTHERS appears at the very end to hear the Misery boys' story.  (A previous listener dies during the story).
NELL CARTER shows up as a witness who don't know nuttin.
NORM CROSBY has a field day as the prosecuting attorney who uses most of his words in erroneous context (He's really funny).
ERIK ESTRADA appears as the jail warden who breaks into an Elvis Presley impersonation of the Misery Blues.  (His jump suit, however, is red).
LOU FERRIGNO isn't green in this one, but he riotously plays the brothers' servant, chauffeur, cook, etc.
SHERMAN HELMSLEY is the villainous Rev. Scheister, and Don King effigy.
RODDY PIPER appears as a wrestling referee who officiates a tag team match between the brothers and two prostitutes (who later show up unexplainably dead?).
FRANK STALLONE appears as Frank the cop, with as much brain matter as his famous brother's Rocky character.
Musical numbers come out of nowhere, and although one is very funny, the others fall flat.
There are tons of bodacious bosomy babes, none of them with any acting talent, but one cowgirl is hilarious when she tries to execute the boys.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A GUILTY PLEASURE, but it does have enough laughs to entertain you.",1085961600,5,2323,4.7875
