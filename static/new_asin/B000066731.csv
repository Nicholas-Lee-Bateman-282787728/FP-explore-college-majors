Goten is now very inspired to kill Buu because Buu turned ChiChi into an egg and stomped her.  Now, after ""days"" of training for the boys, only about a hlaf hour passed on Earth when Buu declares he will wait no longer.  As part of a plan, Piccolo leads Super Buu into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.  Because Trunks wanted to be legendary as a warrior and stretched things out, the two fuses normally, not becoming Super Saiyans.  They were easily toppled, and then showed Piccolo and Buu that they can become Super Saiyans AFTER Fusion!  Can they really win the fight against Buu?  You'll have to buy this video to find out!",1021939200,,752,4.525925925925926

They have a great many new tricks, and may actually stand a chance.",1355702400,,243,4.545454545454546
7962081,5,B000066731,"Gotenks is the most bizarre, immature fighter ever. All he wants to do is put on a good show and he does. This is the first DVD in where Gotenks fights Majin Buu. This has some cool fighting, but it's disappointing because Gotenks doesn't get to go to super-saiyan 3 in this one. The second part of this fight is in the DBZ DVD: LOSING BATTLE, in which Gotenks goes SS3. Here is what you want to know about what's in these great episodes.
Time Struggle
-Chi Chi getting turned in to an egg
-Goten and Trunks training in the Time Chamber
-Goten and Trunks trashtalking Majin Buu (halarious)
-Formation of Gotenks
Super Moves of Gotenks
-Gotenks doing a bunch of goofy moves that don't work
-Gotenks going super-saiyan and doing some awesome moves such as COSMIC HALO, HEADBUTT and one of my favorite moves ever, the SUPER GHOST KAMIKAZEE ATTACK!
Trapped in Forever
-Majin Buu regenerating from Gotenks' ghost attack
-Piccolo destroying the Time Machine door because Gotenks wanted to show off
THE SKINNY: The episodes in this DBZ DVD are some of the funniest I have ever seen. If you want that and good fighting, get this DVD. Obviously, if you are a fan of Gotenks, this DVD is essential.",1046044800,4,1188,4.6084905660377355

Or try beating your head on a wooden bat, not an aluminum one.
Yes, it's that bad.",1026950400,2,244,4.212765957446808

7962084,4,B000066731,"some people call the Buu saga the best ever.  Not hardly, have you even seen Cell and Frieza sagas?, This was a good tape, seeing ChiChi get eaten by Buu is worth the price alone.  Piccolo really started to [anger] me ... in this tape, he just stands there and does nothing he could have at least fought Buu and bought Goten and Trunks a little time, couldn't he? Hey even Krillen gets up the cojones to attack Buu eventually, come on Piccolo, oh well, it was still a good tape, but hardly a must see, and not perfect by far.",1023062400,,525,4.188118811881188
