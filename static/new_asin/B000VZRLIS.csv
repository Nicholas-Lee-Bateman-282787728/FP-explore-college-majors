8220754,1,B000VZRLIS,"My husband and I finished this movie just minutes ago (as I type), and his comment was, ""That's a new low."" I don't think I've ever seen such a miserable piece of film. Stupid - stupid - stupid. I found nothing entertaining other than a couple of humorous lines. Why anyone would want to wed or bed that hulking brute, who was about 43 when he made this movie, is beyond me. Sorry, Carlo Pedersoli.",1306972800,,398,4.32
8220755,5,B000VZRLIS,"One of the earlier Spaghetti's with Bud, sans Terence Hill in which Jack Palance plays an almost comedic and very entertaining role.  Bud Spencer is evading marriage to Palance's sister and Jack Palances character in this movie is not one to be trifled with.  He'll shoot up anything in sight, whereas Bud prefers to use his fists and bull strength.  This movie is interesting because its subject matter is not the run of the mill western generic theme.  It also is humerous without being slapstick. It comes as a pleasant surprise to watch, very entertaining, funny and eye brow raising.  A reallly good movie.  Five stars!",1231632000,4,624,4.839622641509434
