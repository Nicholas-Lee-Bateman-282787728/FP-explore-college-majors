8105640,2,B000E40TK8,"Jo Diorio is a phenomenal player but the video did not do justice to his audience.  The demonstrations for both ""Stella by Starlight"" and ""Autumn Leaves"" were only somewhat inspirational and I found that it was all too difficult for me, a reasonably accomplished jazz guitarist; i.e. I know the tunes, to see around his fingers or determine what frets and strings positions he was playing at.  The duration of each song (as noted in other reviews) was lengthy and at times even the tunes became somewhat boring to watch.

While his limited recommendations were worthwhile he talked very little about his chord fragments, harmonies, arranging solo pieces, fills, comping, bass lines, intervals and chord inversions that he used, as promised in the write up.  His banter demonstrated a lack of preparedness.

2 stars for entertainment value.",1350000000,3,839,5.094890510948905
8105641,5,B000E40TK8,"Joe Diorio plays solo versions of two songs in this video: ""Stella By Starlight"" and ""Autumn Leaves"".  Each performance is so full of such high quality playing that I'll probably be busy for the next year or more trying to learn and absorb it all.  My review is 5 stars only because the playing is so good and so many great ideas are there for the taking.  Unfortunately, the production quality is in the one star range.  The sound quality is very bad.  It's often harder to see his left hand on the 'close-up' camera than in the main view.  There are no written or specific examples.  Joe does offer some good advice and discusses some general concepts, but I would only recommend this to someone with a solid jazz background and a good ear because you will have to transcribe anything you want to get from the video.  My suggestion: find the short clip of the video on youtube.  If that 2:00 clip seems like a gold mine, the video is the mother lode.",1257552000,5,952,4.394285714285714
8105642,3,B000E40TK8,"Alert: The player needs to be already proficient in the harmonies of the tunes, Stella by Starlight & Autumn Leaves, covered in the teaching session.  But then, even though the player is already very familiar with the harmonies of these tunes, Mel Bay should have provided transcription of some kind because there are indeed a lot of musical ideas Joe covers on the tunes.  This DVD is recommended only if the player is:

(1) already proficient in performing the aforementioned tunes,

(2) looking for interesting chordal ideas to play these tunes, and then apply them to some other tunes.

This means that the player has to be on advanced level to make use of this DVD. A less advanced and generally more useful DVD of the same genre is otherwise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Basics-Jazz-Rhythm-Chops/dp/B00008G7PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Basics - Jazz Rhythm Chops</a>

The last thing I need to point out is that the sound quality of this DVD is quite poor.",1205625600,3,1022,5.477707006369426
