7948829,3,B00005OCLL,"Schizo is a very minor offering from British cult favourite director Pete Walker, made in 1976. The plot sees an attractive figure skater called Samantha who is being stalked by the man from her childhood who was responsible for the death of her mother. Has he come back 15 years later to do the same to Samantha? All will be revealed, but he story is not very gripping and the film isn't very well made.

We open with some very plain footage of an industrial site in northern England, as the movie establishes the character of the ""stalker"" with shots of him packing a bag and departing for London. It's not a great start but it gives you an idea of what to expect, because there isn't really anything attractive to took at in the entire film. Most of what is filmed is on location and it's either harshly lit or barely lit at all. Especially disappointing is the fact that many shots are actually out of focus. The script is fairly well written, with people speaking quite naturally, and most of the acting is good, but Lynne Frederick is a bit weak in the title role.

There are some gory moments and a surprise ending that Pete Walker presumably thought would please the punters (even though it's ridiculous), but when looked at as a whole, the film fails to deliver solid entertainment. I much more distracted by the very dated look of the proceedings than the actual events unfolding, with lots of bad 1970s fashions, and some truly awful home wallpaper on display. One supposed highlight shows Samantha being terrorised in a supermarket, but hearing a tannoy announcing special deals on ""Baked Beans at 13p and Instant Coffee at 47p"" just made me chuckle!

I own the R1 Redemption DVD of the film which is very dark and it's hard to see what's happening in some shots, plus is has yet another one of their silly ""home staged"" photo covers that is not an image from the actual movie, so that adds further disappointment. If you are looking to purchase I would recommend the BluRay so that you can at least see what's going on, but there are far better Pete Walker films than this to choose from.",1418428800,,2101,4.538258575197889
7948830,4,B00005OCLL,"Even though this is one of the weaker films from director Pete Walker and screenwriter David McGillivray (FRIGHTMARE; HOUSE OF MORTAL SIN; HOUSE OF WHIPCORD), it is still miles better than most horror films from the 70's. It's a shame that Pete Walker gave up filmmaking after directing HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS in 1983, because he was one of the premiere thinking-person's filmmakers from the U.K. When he teamed up with Mr. McGillivray, the films were thought-provoking, as well as violent as hell. Lynne Frederick give a great performance in this film and the surprise ending, although telegraphed early-on in the film, is still well done. Not one of Walker/McGillivray's best, but still worthwhile viewing.",1410220800,,711,5.137931034482759

7948832,2,B00005OCLL,"Schizo (Pete Walker, 1976)

I can't believe I'm the only person who saw the ending of Schizo coming less than five minutes into the movie. In the seventies (and, unfortunately, beyond), there was a tendency to conflate schizophrenia and what we now know as Dissociative Identity Disorder. (That whether DID even exists is still a controversy raging in psychology journals, as depicted in the recent Julianne Moore vehicle 6 Souls, is interesting, but ultimately irrelevant to the current discussion.)  The film starts out with a voice-over about schizophrenia. Well, actually, it starts out with a voice-over about split personality (the seventies term for DID, back when the now-discredited Sybil was all the rage) that contains a few less-than-subtle clues about the Big Reveal at the end of the film. Within two sequences of its ending, I knew what that Big Reveal was going to be, and you probably will as well. Given that the movie is framed as a genre mystery, this does tend to curtail one's enjoyment.

Plot: Ice skating star Samantha (Phase IV beauty Lynne Frederick, who would appear in only two more feature films before retiring from the business in 1979, at the tender age of twenty-five) has just accepted a proposal of marriage from her beau Alan (John Leyton, in his last feature appearance until 2005's Color Me Kubrick), and the two couldn't be happier. Well, okay, maybe they could, because a long, long shadow from Samantha's past resurfaces at the nuptials: William Haskin (Peeping Tom's Jack Watson), sent to prison fifteen years earlier for murdering Samantha's mother, has been paroled, and it seems he's on the like mother, like daughter trip.  Soon enough, people close to Samantha and Alan start turning up dead, including the playboy husband of Alan's close friend Beth (The Wolves of Willoughby Chase's Stephanie Beacham), who comes to stay with the couple after her spouse's gruesome demise. Ultimately, with Samantha paralyzed by Haskin's presence, it's Beth who is forced to try and stop Haskin from bumping off any more of their compatriots.

Co-writers David McGillivray (who, amusingly, would go on to write a critical history of British sex films soon after) and Murray Smith's decision halfway through the film to thrust Beth into the main role was a very good one; while Frederick is quite the beauty, and I doubt anyone is going to complain about the amount of time she spends unclothed in this film save those who say it's not nearly enough, Stephanie Beacham carries this film to the point where I was wishing they'd done it quite a bit before they actually did. (I should add that whenever I say something in this review about Beacham's strong performance, you should mentally append except that hilarious final scene where she's waving and jumping like a madwoman. It's embarrassingly hilarious.) It's also notable that it's once Beth starts looking into things, the film's base solidifies; it's been kind of a muddled mess up to that point, albeit one with some interesting foley work, but it's right then that the film's giallo-loving heart starts getting worn on its sleeve, and Schizo starts behaving like the stylish-yet-low-rent shocker that it's been trying to be all along. The problem is that by that point, the cat's been out of the bag for far too long, and many casual viewers will likely have lost interest in the story. Recommended for fans of British seventies thrillers, of course, and giallo fans will find some interest in the film's second half; Walker has internalized the conventions of giallo well, and once the film goes in that direction, it does so convincingly enough. But casual thriller fans are best avoiding it. **",1385424000,,3687,4.9886178861788615

7948834,3,B00005OCLL,"A beautiful young ice-skater is stalked by her mother's killer in the weeks following her wedding, but no one seems to believe her despite the number of bodies that begin piling up around her. Who is this crazed madman, and what does he want with Samantha all these years later? Pete Walker fashions another mean little Slasher film out of England while taking key notes from the popular Italian Gialli. Although it is well-played and stylishly directed, the slow pacing, cluttered plot, and predictable twists make this a pretty standard watch. Even still, the bloody payoff in the end comes as a complete shock. Walker slips in several other brutal murder sequences throughout the film while somehow managing to keep it off of the notorious ""Video Nasties"" list in the UK. With enough atmosphere, killing, and suspense to keep the average viewer's attention, SCHIZO proves to be another enjoyable entry in the early English Slasher cycle.

7948835,4,B00005OCLL,"Some movies get too much recognition while others don't get enough. ""Schizo"", falls into the latter category.

Released in 1976...sandwiched between ""Black Christmas"" [74]& Halloween [78]Regrettably, this film is constantly overlooked as a forerunner to the American Slasher. Not to mention, having Italian Giallo trademarks
as well.

Regarding it's slasher/gialli pedigree,it's all here. Red herrings, childhood trauma, sexual transgressions and of course the violent death scenes! The killings are all pretty brutal..one scene in particular is an inspired ""Jason/Friday the 13th"" piece of work...5 years ahead of the game, mind you.

Performances from all the leads whilst not outstanding are competent.
On the downside,""Schizo"", has some moments where the pace could pick a bit but not to the point of total boredom.

""Schizo"", is more than a ""body count"" film with senseless and endless annoying teenagers waiting to get offed. Hopefully, this film will one day receive the reappraisal it yearns for and deserves.

7948836,3,B00005OCLL,"""Schizo"" is an English slasher flick starring Lynne Frederick of Lucio Fulci's ""Four of the Apocalypse"" and Stephanie Beacham of ""And Now the Screaming Starts.""  Both young women are gorgeous and deliver incredible performances.  Don't let appearances deceive you.  This movie begins as an ordinary slasher flck but it has several twists and turns in it that will genuinely shock and surprise the viewer.

  Frederick is an ice skating star who is engaged to be married.  After her marriage, she learns that someone from her past has been paroled from prison and is stalking her.  Soon, a person wearing black gloves begins savagely bludgeoning and stabbing her friends and acquaintances.  Very similar to an Italian giallo, this suspenseful mystery has numerous elements from ""Psycho.""  I only wish the body count had been higher and the ending had more closure.

  Also, I loved the tagline on the DVD jacket:  Schizophrenia . . . When the left hand doesn't know who the right hand is killing.  It fits this stylish thriller perfectly.

  Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't have any extra features.  It doesn't even have a trailer.  Perhaps Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will give it a better release than Image gave it.",1206921600,2,1219,5.0

Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

SCHIZO is a giallo-style shocker from British director Pete Walker (HOUSE OF WHIPCORD, FRIGHTMARE), which offers an appropriately convoluted plot allied to a series of brutal killings by person or persons unknown. The marriage of ice-skating star Samantha Gray (Lynne Frederick, from VAMPIRE CIRCUS) to Alan Falconer (former pop singer John Leyton) attracts the unwelcome attentions of a shadowy figure from Frederick's past, a convicted murderer (Jack Watson) recently paroled from prison. When his apparent stalking of Frederick prompts a series of vicious murders, old secrets begin tumbling into the light of day, culminating in all manner of bloodshed and mayhem...

Though SCHIZO is a little more conventional than Walker's previous outings (""It was less Gothique...I wanted less incident and outrage,"" he explained), it still manages to deliver the goods, even if it takes rather too long to work up a decent head of steam. Most of the shocks and scares are confined to the second half of the film, and while the steady accumulation of narrative details pays dividends in the end, individual scenes are somewhat labored, not helped by Frederick's lack of presence in the leading role. By contrast, Stephanie Beacham (DRACULA A.D. 1972, INSEMINOID) is effortlessly charming as a family friend who turns detective when Frederick identifies Watson as her stalker - had the roles been reversed, this could have been a small masterpiece of psychological horror. Other stand-outs include veteran character actor Watson (recognizable from brief appearances in countless British movies, here given a much weightier role than usual), and a bearded John Fraser (TUNES OF GLORY, THE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE) as a psychiatrist who pays the price for digging too deeply into the circumstances surrounding the death of Frederick's mother.

Walker was always aware of his limitations as a director, allowing clever scriptwork to dictate his method, but he was no hack, as SCHIZO ably demonstrates. Here, his point-and-shoot style is frequently punctuated by moments of genuine visual dexterity, such as the circling of a pen on a newspaper article which gives way via dissolve to a spinning ice-skater, or the truly unsettling seance towards the end of the film in which psychic Trisha Mortimer manifests physical signs of possession by one of the killer's former victims. The subsequent murders are blunt and bloody, with no pretence to subtlety. Peter Jessop's artful cinematography and Chris Burke's sensitive art direction makes a virtue of the film's slightly seedy locations, and while a good fifteen minutes could have been cut from the 109 minute running time, Alan Brett's keen editing skills manages to streamline an increasingly complicated scenario.

Sadly, this was Walker's last collaboration with writer David McGillivray, who had originally been assigned to overhaul an old unused script by Murray Smith (author of Walker's earlier films), but McGillivray felt that the killer's identity was too obvious from the outset. Maybe so, but viewers may still be taken off-guard by some of the climactic revelations. Bottom line: If you're a fan of Walker's output or British exploitation in general, you'll overlook the film's slow-burning tempo and enjoy its outlandish plot developments. Worth a look.",1007510400,8,3374,5.380681818181818
