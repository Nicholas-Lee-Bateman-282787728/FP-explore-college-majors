6463448,4,B00L2YXY6U,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and was a little put off by the short ""dream sequence"" that was included early on, but then got into it and enjoyed it for the kinda quirky revenge flick that it is. The acting and the technical movie-making were surprisingly good; this was not put together by three guys with a camcorder. The plot is not particularly complicated or believable, but then it rarely is with a revenge flick, and that didn't reduce my enjoyment. I finished the movie satisfied, and even willing to watch it again if a buddy comes over who's not seen it. Thumbs up!",1426896000,3,591,4.481481481481482

6463451,4,B00L2YXY6U,"I love modern day movies that have a grindhouse feel to them.  And I don't mean films that can make the picture grainy, to look as if its being played on a cheap reel.  Im talking about movies that capture the heart of the grindhouse genre.  Movies like PLANET TERROR and CHILLERAMA are just a couple of titles that spring to mind.  The latest film release from director Steven R. Monroe, simply titled MONIKA, fits nicely into this classification as well.  And while its not perfect (ok, grindhouse films were far from it), the film is still very enjoyable and entertaining.

Monroe is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.  I absolutely LOVED his remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and Ive enjoyed several of his lower-budget creature-features as well, including MONGOLIAN DEATH WORM, WYVERN, and IT WAITS.  I had the pleasure of seeing him at Texas Frightmare Weekend a few years ago, and he was a real class act.  I hope to see many more features from him in the future.

MONIKA is shot with a very grindhouse-like style.  There are not many moving camera angles, but there are a lot of singular, stationary shots.  Also, there are many scenes where the color seems to be diminished.  This could be due in part to the desert shooting locations, but it might be intentional as well.  Either way, the look enhances the film experience and helps to set the movies overall tone.

The acting is great, and I am very impressed with the whole cast.  Jason Wiles and Cerina Vincent do a stellar job in their roles.  I find this especially impressive when considering Cerina Vincents earliest role was Yellow Galaxy Ranger Maya in POWER RANGERS: LOST GALAXY.  This surprised me, but she has come a long way.  I will admit I was leery about seeing C. Thomas Howell onscreen (he doesnt usually show up in the best of films), however he does a fine job here.

But for as entertaining as MONIKA is, the film does have some flaws.  The plot will most likely be confusing to some (as the premonitions aspect of Wiles character will throw some viewers off).  I personally enjoyed how this all plays out, but I can see some viewers reacting differently after discovering how the movie ends.  Also, you cant expect much substance out of this film.  It is what it is, and it pretty much tells you up front what to expect.  If you can keep that mindset going in, you should enjoy watching it.

For me, MONIKA is a win.  I recommend it, however I know some of you will not like it.  Still, if you're a fan of grindhouse like me, you should welcome this flick with open arms.  The film is available now if you want to check it out.",1411689600,8,2619,4.501061571125265

6463464,2,B00L2YXY6U,"The plot to this doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense, but what really makes this movie unwatchable is the ridiculously poor cinematography that's defined almost entirely by colored filters, bad exposure, and a shaking camera.  Is it supposed to be evocative of a dream?  Is it supposed to make the dull, static scenes feel exciting and interesting?  I don't know, but it's annoying and it doesn't disguise that this is an amateurish, boring movie where too many shots just feel like filler used to drag this out to a feature length running time.",1469577600,,553,4.680412371134021

I'll say this first, I liked it as much as Last Man Standing, and that's saying something.  But I'm torn between giving it two stars and five stars.  The story is a really decent bang-bang, shoot em up, with the cool added twist of a strong/tough (smokin hot) lead female character along with a realistic down at the heels actor type psychic male character.  The only reason I'm tempted to give it the two stars is the way they used the fake outs at the end.  I keep going back and forth with kind of hating them and really liking them.  The part that seemed like the end was a really decent enough ending, though it was nice in a way to keep things going, because it was kind of anticlimactic and a bit sad.  Though, that was why I liked it too, it was very non-hollywood.  I feel the same about the double fake outs at the end though, they were nonstandard, and made things more fun and trippy.  Anyway, I'm giving it four stars because of how fun it was to watch, and I guess I'll stick with that, since really that's all that matters...",1431907200,,1184,4.25

6463594,4,B00L2YXY6U,"Wow ... so much better than I ever expected, this is a fun movie.  Loved it!  Not so much 'Grindhouse' (IMHO) as it is an epic graphic novel sprung to life, where normal rules do not apply - except revenge.  Please don't dismiss actor Cerina Vincent ('Monika') as just another 'bimbo' because of the first few minutes - as I almost did.  Keep watching - she's actually a talented actor fully capable of carrying this movie.  Even if she's ... well, you just have to watch.  Honestly a fun and well-made action flick.  And check out the opening title sequence - it's excellent, as is the musical scoring.  Have fun, and thanks for reading!",1431388800,10,638,4.535087719298246

6463599,4,B00L2YXY6U,"It was a decent movie.  Very good try at putting a new spin on a cliche.  I must say that the girl who played Monika is a true beauty, but the awful dye job was distracting.  Worth a watch.",1430956800,2,189,3.7948717948717947

6463601,1,B00L2YXY6U,"It's depressing to see once-decent actors (Howell) signing on to really bad projects. But everyone has to eat, I guess. This isn't the worst film ever made, but it's close. I have to assume the positive reviews were written by friends and family of those who had some stake in this miscarriage. The rest of the cast seems to have been recruited from an AA meeting, along with the writer and director. Stay sober, guys.",1430265600,,418,4.586666666666667

6463609,4,B00L2YXY6U,"Quite the effort here in all things. Not a typical film in the unfolding of the story. I do feel it could have been cut down a bit in length/exposition (story could have been tighter). I did like the way this was shot and the performances from the actors. Most of all the color pallet of the film was perfect in support of the theme, setting, and story arc. Some of the shot sequencing/visuals were really good.",1427673600,,411,4.35064935064935

Ok so the production is fair & the cop scene very low budget - looked like guys just running lines

8663430,3,B00L2YXY6U,"I liked it but, didn't count on it being a master piece when I saw C. Thomas Howell had a part in it...longtime since he was directed by Coppala but, you know for a story that has been told before in many different ways it's worth a bowl of popcorn if for no other reason than to see the lead actress who is quite good in the role and she's not the typical blond by any stretch",1488499200,,377,3.909090909090909
