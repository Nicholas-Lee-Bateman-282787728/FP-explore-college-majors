1072963,1,6305807426,"If you purchase this movie because you are a fan of Keith Emerson (as I did), the only part you will enjoy is the music.  This movie is typical of the nonsense that Europeans call film.  It seems its only goal from a  visual aspect is to present wild, un-connected poorly acted scenes.  The  story was almost non-existent.  The lighting and set design looked like  that of a college film student.  The dubbing was almost unbearable to  listen to.  If you want to support Keith Emerson - buy his CD's.",957830400,3,500,4.455555555555556
1072964,5,6305807426,"The Anchor Bay DVD nearly blew me away. Thick colors, full sound and the clearest image I've ever encountered (as good - even better than AB's Tenebre). And Dario himself gives and on-screen introduction. I can't think  of a more definite release.
And for the film: This has to be the  strangest, most-dreamlike horror-fantasy I've seen. Very much like Dryer's  Vampyr this film is a nightmare on celluloid and not just a narration.  Don't look for the plot - you won't look for it in your dreams either.",957830400,,504,4.693181818181818
1072965,5,6305807426,"If you're into the atmosphere of the world of horror, this is the flick for you. The music...the set designs...the premise..everything takes you into the most dreamy of the genre. This film is even more fairy tale-like  than Suspiria, which of course is another great Dario flick.  This is the  most dreamy, ambient, vibey, gothic, colour cascaded, trippy, at times  shocking, and yes possibly,  esoteric film I have ever seen. I am torn  between deciding if the world of inferno is the perfect version of Hell, or  of Heaven. And Emerson's score tossed in with some Verdi....simply  brilliant.",956966400,5,594,4.989795918367347
1072966,5,6305807426,"Don't analyse this film or admire it's fine acting talents (the film is dubbed) - you won't get anywhere. Instead admire the skillful direction by the virtuoso director, Dario Argento. This film, like Suspiria, are truly  ingenious as they don't quite seem like this world. The sets are all  fractured and watered with vibrant colours of red and blue. The most  effective part of the film is the soundtrack. Most of the film, including  one great and graphic murder scene, are (if I remember correctily) set to  Beethoven. Enjoy!",955152000,4,529,4.898876404494382
1072967,2,6305807426,"...  Inferno is not-definately not an enjoyable movie. Ihonestly wanted to give the film a higher rating than 2 starsconsidering the massive signature Argento stylistic input but theplot/storyline is just completely unbearable. The slow pace and nonsensicle structure is unforgiving and the film leaves you drained after watching it considering all of the questions you'll ask yourself about the movie. Unfortunately the film never-NEVER EXPLAINS THE ""PLOT"" FULLY. While this is a known factor of Argento films, the plot in Inferno is unacceptable! It's the absolute most annoying Argento has ever conjured up!... Still, Inferno features some nice visuals and the dubbing is really cheesy-but in a stylistic atmospheric way. Inferno is a work of art but definately not a good movie. See to only admire the visuals (or become bored to death) *2stars!* END",954547200,3,854,5.325925925925926
1072968,5,6305807426,"This film is too often overshadowed by its predecessor, Suspiria.  That's unfortunate because, in many ways, Inferno is the superior of the two.  It unfolds like a nightmare.  We are drawn in to dark recesses where evil  awaits with outstretched arms.  Logic breaks apart as the dream takes hold.  We are left with unfathomable images of an increasingly alarming nature.  Terror knows no bounds and no place is safe.  The final revelation is  thankfully unexplained, leaving the viewer to make up his/her own mind  about what it all means.  This is a macabre jem that deserves to be seen.  Forget the latest dreck that is seeping out of Hollywood.  Inferno is ten  times better!",949017600,3,678,4.833333333333333
1072969,4,6305807426,"Dario Argento's second installment in the (as yet unfinished) three mothers trilogy. It takes place in the same hyper, dream logic, over saturated color world first introduced in Suspiria. Argento plays the same  games with space and time as H.P. Lovecraft does in some of his short  stories. By merely opening doors or turning corners, characters move from  recognizable worlds of physical normalcy into screaming nightmare worlds  that defy both logic and physical reality. A truly wonderful movie that  should not be missed by any fan of the bizarre. Hopefully a widescreen  version will be released soon. (Hint Hint)",924220800,,620,5.212121212121212
1072970,4,6305807426,"Although the acting is fairly poor, the dialogue stilted, and the plot non-existent, this movie--as the Re/Search book ""Incredibly Strange Films"" notes--is about as close as one gets to the flow and feel of a  dream. I would attribute the mood to the bravura visuals--classically  composed still shots a la Peter Greenaway; planes of saturated color  winking on and off as characters move through a outrageous deco sets;  swooping lens movements worthy of Sam Raimi's  ""wraithCam""--working in tandem with the gorgeous, occasionally  incongruous prog-rock stylings of ELP keyboard whiz Keith Emerson. Scenes  of great formal beauty are intermittently jarred by stabbings, immolations,  strangulations, eyeball-gougings, and rodent attacks, all fairly gratuitous  (just like in real life!), and Emerson's synthesizer flailings are equally  prone to erupt without warning--often to miraculous effect. The music that  accompanies one woman's taxi ride through the rainswept streets of Rome is  wild and offbeat and sticks with you, and the Gregorian finale--the  repeated incantation ""Suspiriarum, Lachrymarum,  Tenebrarum,""  referring to the ""mothers"" (all of them witches) who cause the  film's mayhem--sounds like a rock opera version of Orff's ""Carmina  Burana"" (it's hokey, but trust me, it works!). I have also seen  ""Suspiria,"" but prefer this film on the level of pure, macabre  experience.",918432000,,1394,5.712195121951219

1073192,3,6305807426,"Deep Red, Tenebre, Suspiria, Phenomena, Four Flies on Grey Velvet are all some of my favorite horror movies out there, so I'd definitely classify myself as an Argento fan.  But sadly this was one of his weaker efforts.

Hearing that this was the spiritual successor to Suspiria had me looking forward to watching it, but styling is about the only thing the two have in common.  Inferno looks great, but that's where the praise ends.

The story was disjointed and even pointless.  There was a scene where an old crippled man was in a river being attacked by rats, most of which were obviously rubber, and then a local food vendor hears his cries for help and proceeds to come slice his throat with a knife. On the surface that sounds pretty awesome, but I'm not sure how it played in with the story.  Oh and the geezer was initially out there trying to drown a burlap sack full of cats before his attack, that should be mentioned as well.

There was also another goofy scene where a woman was attacked by cats.  And by attacked, I mean someone off screen was literally throwing house cats at her.  Funny to watch but too silly to take seriously.

I won't reveal the end, but when the credits started rolling it was like...oh, so that's it?

I should mention one more thing, poor choice not going with Goblin here on the soundtrack.  They did amazing work on Tenebre and Deep Red and should have been included here.  I will admit that the final song in the movie wasn't bad, but the rest of the soundtrack didn't do anything for me.",1446336000,,1530,4.460431654676259

1073322,5,6305807426,Inferno is the second part in Dario Argento's three mothers trilogy. This film is a great sequel to Suspiria. Very eerie and has an ambiance to it that only Argento can achieve. In my opinion it is one of his best films.,1419984000,,220,4.261904761904762
1073323,4,6305807426,"This Blu-Ray looks good, but be warned that this film contains animal cruelty.  In several scenes cats and rats are handled and subjected to serious stress.  Most disturbing is a scene of a cat being carried by the ""scruff"" of its neck.  At one point the cat appears to be twisted slightly to the side in order to elicit crying.  There is also a scene where a group of ants are sprayed with poison, and it appears genuine - while in another a cat is (fed, partially off camera) a live mouse.  The mouse scene is historically notorious, but personally I find the scene of the cat wrenched by the back of the neck worse.  While many people may shrug their shoulders, in my opinion and in that of millions of others, hurting or killing an animal or yes, an insect, for pure entertainment is never justified.

Without the animal cruelty, this is one of Argento's better films.  The Blue Underground Blu-Ray looks very good with lots of sharp scenes and strong colors.  The 7.1 soundtrack is decent, though not as strong as the 7.1 separation might suggest.  Recommended, but with a very large caveat regarding the use of its animal actors.  The 4 stars are a balance between a strong Blu-Ray and decent movie, with some consideration given to the time this was made when evaluating the (mis)use of animal co-stars.",1412294400,2,1310,4.603448275862069

1073327,2,6305807426,"After buying this along with ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"" and loving those two and already being a fan of Argento's ""Demons"" films, I had high expectations for this one but was highly disappointed. It took me all my energy to not fall asleep watching ""Inferno"". The plot made no sense whatsoever and random characters kept getting introduced as they were important and then almost immediately killed off. The only good things stil intact were the visual effects and somewhat interesting climax, about the only time in the movie I got somewhat interested.
Other than that, watching this was punishment to me. I wound up selling it a friend who collects horror flims.

1073328,5,6305807426,"Despite considerable input from Lamberto Bava and Mario Bava INFERNO had a limited theater run partly because it was being investigated by public prosecutors. Many, however, now consider it to be Argento's finest Work. The ABC Arrow Bluray comes with an incredible 44cmx35cm poster and other worthwhile enclosures. This is the second part of the Three Mothers trilogy, and the Mother Of Tears from part 3 has a prominent but not-really-speaking appearance in a couple of scenes. Argento gets the absolute maximum from his Eurobabes, particularly Miracle and Nicolodi, something he was to do continuously until his sudden and unexpected dip with Dracula. The footage which is shot in Rome and New York looks great, and embellishes the brilliant but lighter colours of this Bluray which work particularly well when there is action going on. One of the many stand-out scenes, which is depicted in the very flattering poster, is where Miracle does an incredibly sexy underwater swim for lost keys into someone's Gothic bedroom. There are several spectacular victims which are on a par with Argento's usual output of bloodiness. Arrow 16/9.",1398384000,,1135,5.2076502732240435
1073438,3,6305807426,"I reluctantly give this 3 stars. This just comes up short after the intriguing style of Suspiria. There are moments of visual appeal but overall it just feel disjointed and broken with most of the 'gore' factor coming off extremely cheap and goofy. Typically I accept those gore elements because they are only mere distractions that highlight plot twists in Argento's works, but in this film it only adds to the sloppy mess.

In the end I just don't buy this as a decent or meaningful second act after Suspiria... most know that Argento's concepts of The Three Mothers trilogy just failed completely. Why did he even bother? It was a grand idea but he failed in pulling it off. Suspiria is a classic that should have just stood on it's own.

Re watching this I noticed horrible frame rate, instead of fluid movement there are many scenes where there is that lag type visual effect, I'll have to compare my DVD copy to see if it suffers the same problems. I'm not very impressed with this transfer.

I'm not a religious person, more of a humanist... believe in reality but once when watching this movie I had a weird experience while watching the ending. Typically I laugh at the lame ending but I was really paying attention to the vibe etc, when death shows up a very dark message kind of popped into my mind, ""welcome death into your heart"", now I was just relaxing playing my guitar like usual and not depressed or any other strange mental activity going on and it creeped me out to the point of wanting to toss all Argento's movies into the trash because of possible visual and audible masking of subliminal messages. Seriously weird... I don't want to welcome death in any form into my life while I'm still living. It makes me want to research possible subliminal masking in movies.

Edit:

I've come to realize it's not so much Argento that I like but his cinematographers much like I concluded about Ridley Scott. If you observe his choice of cinematographers you can see a clear patern of visual art quality to his films. So in short most of what Argento fans atribute to HIS talents are actually the talents of the cinematographers and film editors. Take away his best collaborators and you get crap like Mother Of Tears, Phenomena and his other lesser works.",1398211200,5,2268,4.617866004962779

1073440,4,6305807426,"I decided to buy the Dario Argento Collection Vol 1 used. Since Phenomena and Inferno are both over 10 dollars (used or new) I decided to buy this used for about 20 dollars.

The dvds come in a very strong dvd case with two separate disc holders that don't look like they'll drop the dvd so they will be fine during shipping.

Both dvds look crisp and clear and the audio seems to be just fine (not to keen on that stuff).

Phenomena is about a girl who finds out she can communicate with insects, while she's at a boarding school where students seem to be dropping like flies. It's the movie that just so happened to influence the making of the original Clock Tower for the SNES, and if you've ever played it or emulated the game, the atmosphere is basically the same as the movie. Great movie, very fun.

Inferno is the sequel to the dearly beloved Suspiria. It's a movie that is HEAVY on atmosphere, relying on the color blue, and red (and it's combination, purple) to surround the whole setting, almost as if it were a dream, or better yet a nightmare. It doesn't have the same beautiful kills that Suspiria did, nor is the soundtrack as good but it's a worthy sequel. The biggest fault for this film though is how split up the narrative is, seemingly having no real main character till the second half of the film.

My biggest fault with this package is that there no subtitles for either film, which is something I hate not having. My hearing isn't bad, but at times I miss things that people say and having subtitles helps me keep up with the narrative.

Together this package was worth the 20 dollars I spent, and I'm happy with my purchase (seeing that this and rest of the Dario Argento collection DVDs seem to be going up in price). I say snatch it up when you see it for 20 dollars and make sure to check the description. Make sure people it's both dvds, none are scratched, all that regular things you check for in used dvds. If your shelling 20 dollars for a used dvd it better be in GOOD condition and not scratched up.",1392163200,2,2034,4.353562005277045

Dario Argento may work in the horror genre, but his cinema speaks to a deeper emotional current, one that so-called modern-day ""auteurs"" seem unable to reach.

1073536,2,6305807426,"My copy starts with the director making an appeal for understanding, which I took to be a bad sign of what was to come.

The story underpinning this movie is relatively straightforward and starts very promisingly with a situation that builds to an unlikely (but very evocative and atmospheric) underwater sequence. Illogical, and in my opinion some other footage could have been sacrificed to make this a little more believable from the character's Point of View, motivation-wise, but very well executed.

After that fairly strong start the movie basically fell apart, with an ensemble cast we never get to know well enough to care about and a wandering plot that failed to hold any real interest for me after the first half hour or so. Characters wander into this story, are given portentous (or pretentious) lines to say and then are rendered irrelevant.

It seemed to me a bunch of ideas for scenes that had been glued together with no inter-scene continuity to give the story any sort of structure as it was told rather than a story that had been fractured in order to tell it in a novel fashion and disguise its ordinariness.

And it suffered greatly from having no point of view character for us to hitch our suspension of disbelief to.

Even I know that you can't tell a story effectively this way.

The ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic.  The film is definitely an exercise in style over substance.  Still, the movie looks great and contains many very haunting images and murders.

1073601,5,6305807426,"I should point out that I'm a pretty big Argento fan, so my review should be taken as such.  Of all of Argento's films, my two favorites alternate between Suspiria and Inferno.  It seems that no matter how many times I rewatch those films, they actually get better with each new viewing, (usually the opposite happens).  Each of those films have a certain unique aesthetic value and atmosphere.

With that being said, while I would recommend Suspiria to a first time Argento viewer, Inferno is actually the last of his good films which I'd recommend.  While Suspiria tried to have somewhat of a plot, Inferno's plot is pretty weak and sometimes hard to follow.  I think another problem people have with this film is while its a sequel to Suspiria and has a similar look and feel, its a very different film, this film can't be approached as a sequel.  It also further moves away from his early films in that instead of using the normal Goblin soundtrack it uses a Keith Emerson score which has a more piano/classical music feel to it.  I actually hated the film the first time I watched it, but every time I've seen it since the plot gets clearer, the visuals get better and I love the film more and more.  It seems that many of the Argento's I loved on the first watch can't even come close to holding up on rewatches like this film.

As for the Bluray release, the transfer is beautiful.  Of course I'm comparing this to the Anchor Bay / Blue Underground (2007) DVD release and it looks like a completely different film.  If you have those older disks this is well worth the upgrade.  As for the reviewer who complains that this release isn't as up to par as Tron, I've not seen Tron so I can't comment on that, but usually the italian films from this era use a cheaper film stock so the original film quality wouldn't have been as good as tron (I don't know if Inferno is this same way or if its BU's fault, the transfer looks beautiful to me).

The supplements are few but good.

The trailer seems to be a straight transfer from the SD disk, it should be watched only after the film since its full of spoilers, I do find it intersting just how much the trailer tries to make this a fast paced horror film instead of the slow atmospheric film it truly is.

There is an interview with Argento and L.Bava, this also seems to be a SD transfer from the Anchor Bay disk.  Its worth watching as well, especially for the sections where it talks about M. Bava having a part in the special effects, in a way this is one of the last films the great Bava worked on before he died. His visuals/effects work very well with Argento's vision.

There are two new interviews with the brother and sister in the film (Leigh McCloskey and Irene Miracle).  Both of these interviews are about 15 minutes each and I found them interesting.  I do wish they would have been longer.

Overall if you're an inferno fan and have the older Anchor Bay / non SE Blue Underground disk then this is an essential upgrade, the transfer looks great and its like watching the film in a different light.  If the viewer is new to Argento, while I love this film, there are probably better places to start.  I'd recommend The Bird with the Crystal Plumage as an accessible starter film.  Suspiria (hopefully it will get a bluray release soon) and Deep Red are also two brilliant films to begin with.

In short thanks Blue Underground for giving us another great transfer of a marvelous film!  I can't wait for the releases of Deep Red and The Cat O' Nine Tails.",1304726400,3,3522,4.421705426356589

I got tired of hearing that piano over and over again. I think this film has great lightning effects, like the many different colours that is used in this film.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I think it`s an improvement over the old Anchor Bay DVD that i have. I found that the colours looks more sharper and detailed + vibrant. This is how the colours should look like.

Audio Quality: 3.5/5

I saw this film with the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. I must say i found this remix disappointing. First of all, i think the bass when we hear the theme song twice (you know the one in the end credits), sounds a bit canned. I think it lacks bass. Too bad, because when i saw Arrow Video`s BD of City of the living dead, with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track, it sounded much better in my opinion.

At least the theme song there i think did not sound canned or lacked any bass. Hm. Apart from the canned sound of the theme song and lack of bass, i think it sounds only good. Strange thing, the flames we hear, i think have good, but not great bass. The sounds of the flames had more bass than the theme song.

I thought the 5.1 audio track would at least sound just as good as Arrow Video`s BD of City of the living dead. I hope their future Blu-rays with DTS-HD MA 5.1 will sound better than this films audio track. If they sound as good as their BD of City of the living dead, i will be happy to buy Blu-rays from them.

Other reviews here outline what happens, but what dissapointed me was the fact that this is nowhere near as gory or cringe-making as Argento's other works, such as Tenebre or Suspiria. A normal person would be sick and unable to look at the screen on those. but that's hardly the case here. With Argento you usually get to see blades going in, glass cutting slowly through flesh, heads being taken off right in front of you etc.. sick I know but that's part of the spice in his work. Here you don't get that, there is even one scene where a woman is attacked by cats. she just rolls around and it isn't that disturbing, but then when the killer goes to bring the knife down on her the scene fades to black and you don't get to see the stabbing, no blood, no knife going in, nothing. Anyone who knows Argento must know a scene like that is far off the mark for him. The visuals of the deaths were a big part of his films. Same thing when the guy gets his head chopped off in the river, there is no blood to speak off and it looks pretty tame by Argento standards. He didn't do the same beautiful, disturbing photography he is known for on the deaths.

1073610,3,6305807426,"At its essence, Inferno tells a classic horror movie tale about a haunted house.  It's a bit odd, bombards the viewer with random, twisted imagery when least expected, attacks the senses with a kaleidoscope of colors, and overpowers the eardrums with pounding piano accompaniment.

Beginning in what feels like a movie half-finished, a woman is reading a book about Three Mothers (Tenebrarum, Suspiriorum, and Lachrymarum).  Written by an architect/alchemist named Varelli, it tells of these three evil entities their resting places.  One such place is in New York, and the young lady, Rose, reading/translating the Latin book senses a connection to her surroundings.

Even though I had to watch the introduction twice to understand it, with talks of mothers, keys, cellars, and what-not, the story sets up fairly well.  Although, the beginning is a little too packaged for most viewers, myself included, but from all that I have read of Argento, the zip-locked plot is not the important part.  The voice-over continuously leading both Rose and the viewer towards the next step is hilarious: ""The second key is hidden in the cellar.""

What follows is the meat of the story, doom and gloom awaits any who dare delve into the wickedness of not only the Three Mothers story, but also any who snoop around the house - the true star of the movie.  Characters die non-connected albeit creative deaths, as the world itself, ostensibly controlled by the Three Mothers, unleashes its fury.  Spectacular deaths, amazing in both their gore and their senselessness, it's horror for the sake of horror, with no pretense or worry about an in depth plot or protagonist.

Being an Argento neophyte, I can say one thing without reservation about Inferno: This is absolutely not the right movie to start viewing his work.  For all of the movies in his oeuvre, and for all fans passionate fans, jumping straight into Argento's Inferno is a little too hot; there needs to be a period to adjust to the heat.  While the lighting, colors, and sets for some of the scenes are way ahead of their time, at times it feels like a movie directed by someone with severe ADHD, jumping from here to there without transition.  This movie is directed explicitly for the foreign horror connoisseur, a person with true passion for the legacy of horror.  I'm sure it's perfect for the target audience.  Granted it's an obviously older movie and can be appreciated as such, it's much too spastic and disconnected, not to mention extremely lacking in character development to actually create a new Argento fan.

1073682,4,6305807426,"Like millions of other Dario Argento fans, I am eagerly awaiting the American release of ""The Mother of Tears.""  In the meantime, I decided to review the first two films in the Three Mothers Trilogy.  The first film, ""Suspiria,"" was based on Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs.  The second film, ""Inferno,"" is based on Mater Tenebrarum, the Mother of Shadows.

  In the prologue of ""Inferno,"" viewers are introduced to the novel The Three Mothers.  However, they soon learn that it is not a work of fiction.  The Three Mothers (actually they are sisters) are witches.  An architect, E. Varelli, built each one a gothic mansion in different parts of the world.  Death and destruction have always surrounded these mansions.

  A young poet, Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle of ""Midnight Express"" and ""Puppet Master"") lives in New York.  She buys The Three Mothers and suspects that the apartment building in which she lives belongs to the Mother of Shadows.  Disturbed by the book's contents, she mails a letter to her brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey of ""Dallas"" fame).  Soon people around them begin dying in gruesome manners, murdered by an unseen assailant.

  There are many similarities between ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno.""  First, and foremost, is the fact that they were both directed by the Italian Hitchcock, Dario Argento.  Both have gorgeous, elaborate sets that are filmed in a dreamlike palette of primary colors of reds and blues.  In ""Suspiria,"" the house was a ballet school with students as victims.  The house of ""Inferno"" is an apartment building and its wealthy tenants are victimized.  Both have gruesome death sequences involving animals.  In ""Suspiria,"" a blind man is attacked and killed by his seeing eye dog.  Rats and cats attack tenants of ""Inferno.""  Both films have great musical scores to accentuate the violence.  The endings are fiery.

  Furthermore, Alida Valli, who starred in ""Suspiria,"" returns for another evil role.  Daria Nicolodi who co-wrote the script for ""Suspiria"" has a supporting role as well.  She was the long-time girlfriend of Dario Argento and also starred in his giallo mega hit ""Deep Red.""  She starred in other films of his as well such as ""Phenomena,"" ""Tenebre,"" and ""Opera.""

  Unfortunately, ""Inferno"" never enjoyed the same success as ""Suspiria.""  This is partly due to its ending which seemed contrived.  It was very difficult to understand.  However, sometimes dreams, or nightmares, can be difficult to comprehend.  If we approach ""Inferno"" as a nightmare, then anything is possible.

  It will be very interesting to view ""The Mother of Tears"" for the first time and look for similarities between it and the first two installments of the Three Mothers Trilogy.  In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the visual roller coaster ride from Hell that is ""Inferno.""",1221523200,2,2812,5.083516483516483

She accidently unleashes unspeakable evil, her boyfriend whom just came back from Rome he finds out that Sarah is dead and must solve the mystery of these bizarre killings and weird happenings.

Very dark and bloody yet complex supernatural horror thriller shocker from Italy's greatest horror maestero Dario Argento is one of the better films of his carreer. Sure the plot is full of holes and can be a tad confusing, but the film does offer some visually stunning atmosphere and some gory murders like decapictations and bloody stabbings. It's suppose to be part of the ""Three Mothers"" trilogy which started with ""Suspiria"" as this movie is suppose to be a sequel to and finished recently with ""Mother of Tears: The Third Mother"" as this is worth a look for fans of the genre and Dario Argento.

1073684,1,6305807426,"After making his two masterpieces, ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"", it seemed inevitable that Dario Argento's next film would disappoint. However, ""Inferno"" is not just disappointing, it is downright bad.

The second film in the ""Three Mothers"" trilogy (the first being ""Suspiria"" and the third being the recently released ""The Mother of Tears"") is about a young woman who thinks that her New York apartment building happens to house one of three witches, the Mother of Darkness. That's it. The plot really doesn't progress much beyond that. I'd like to say that much investigation and suspense follows, but it doesn't. Sure there's a string of gory murders and the young woman's brother shows up in New York, but these scenes are all rather random and don't really form a coherent storyline.

As with all Dario Argento films, the acting is atrocious. However, because ""Inferno"" lacks the coherance of ""Deep Red"" and the stylish beauty of ""Suspiria"", this is all the more apparent. At times I felt like I was watching a bad t.v. movie, not a film by one of the greatest horror directors of all time.

Inferno is the second film in the ""Three Mother's Trilogy"" by Argento (about the mother of darkness), with the first being Suspiria (mother of sigh's), and the last one titled Mother of Tear's, which has just  been made now and shown at film festival's as we speak. Argentos' Inferno follow's a lot of the same theme's and imagery as Suspiria did, but instead of dealing on theme of witch-craft, deal's more with the theme of alchemy. It has the same beautiful cinematography, vibrant color's, and attention to detail that Suspiria has (maybe even a little more), and a very dark and beautiful nightmarish quality that only Argento can deliver. Argento film's are usually lumped into two catagorie's: Supernatural thriller's (Suspiria, Inferno) and murder mystery's (Deep Red, Tenebre), and while it's hard for me to choose, I'd have to say I love his supernatural stuff the most. Inferno has a good amount of special effect's, stylistic murder's and good gore scene's (probably a little more than Suspiria in my opinion) that are very well done, and Mario Bava also helped out with some of the the visual effect's for some of the scene's. I'm so sick of hearing people say that Inferno is hard to follow and incoherant. The plot is very simple, you just have to pay attention to it. It make's perfect sense, but you must have an attention-span greater than a five year olds'!!!!! Italian director's do not spell out every little detail of the for the viewer's like American movie's, they try to make you piece together the puzzle through dioluge and character's actions, instead of literally describing the plot in full detail, which I really love about them, and find flattering to my intelligence. The score for Inferno is one of my favorite score's ever for a horror film and is f*****g amazing to say the least, although it is not performed by Goblin (who did all the great Argento score's), it is still f*****g amazing, I can't wait to pick up the soundtrack.

As in Susperia the cinematography is amazing and the kill scenes are always (in true Argento fashion) not only gory, but gory in a clever and orignal way with kills that at least i've never seen before.  The finale of the film is fantastic.  Overall this film was everything i'd expect from Argento.  I'd recomend it to any fan of horror.",1189296000,2,494,4.444444444444445
1073690,4,6305807426,"After the success of SUSPIRIA , Dario Argento (Master of Horror) presents INFERNO, a journey into darkness. Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle) reveals the dark secrets of ""The Three Mothers"" (Mater Tenebrarum, Mater Suspiriorium, & Mater Lacrimarum) written by architect Varelli and discovers that the source of all evil resides in the building she lives in. Aware of her discoveries she mysteriously disappears. Mark Elliot (Leigh Mc Closkey) travels to New York City in search of his missing sister Rose only to unravel the mysteries she set out to find in an inferno nightmare. Considered the semi-sequel to SUSPIRIA there are many similarities but INFERNO seems more watered down and disjointed. Leigh Mc Closkey takes on Jessica Harper's character from SUSPIRIA and the ending stands in the footsteps of SUSPIRIA. Still there are many elements to distinguish INFERNO as a master piece. Dario Argento is the master of lighting, creating an atmosphere he knows best, setting the trend for other directors. Alida Valli makes her appearance but the impact isn't as strong as in SUSPIRIA as I think to be one of her finest roles. Keith Emerson from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer does a superb soundtrack.",1184889600,,1193,5.123076923076923

The performances are very poor, in marked contrast to Suspiria. The music is also strangely sedate for a horror film, also in contrast to Suspiria.

1073781,5,6305807426,"Inferno is the second film of Dario Argento's unfinished ""The Three Mothers"" trilogy (while Suspiria is the first film).  This film is classic Argento with its brilliant cinematography, abrasive yet eerie soundtrack (which seems out of place in certain scenes), brutal/bizarre deaths and sub par acting.  Argento has stated that the actors aren't the focus of his films; rather the environment, mood, story and technical aspects are the potent force behind his masterpieces.

One thing about this movie that I found totally surreal and almost fantasy like was the lighting.  The illumination in this giallo creates an ambient and nebulous setting, which is very unique.  The light gels and/or set design in Inferno paint a mood in just about every scene.  These moods vary from precarious (yellow) to foreboding (blue) then tranquil (green) to wrath (red) and back to enigmatic (purple).  This type of movie making magic really plays a huge part in the film.  I've shown Inferno to people before and they might not have liked the movie, but were impressed with the lighting and cinematography.

As for the plot, well it is somewhat lackluster.  Mark, who is schooling in Europe, receives a letter from his sister Rose, who lives in New York.  Rose's letter has a sense of bereavement to it, in regards to the apartment she is living.  Rose believes that there are some clairvoyant or supernatural forces at work.  Therefore, this sends Mark to The Big Apple to console his sister.  However, this is the beginning of Mark's disconsolate hardships.  He seems to be putting a puzzle together that doesn't want to solved.

Inferno might have to be witnessed more than once to fully digest what has transpired.  However, I have seen it about a dozen times and I still don't know if I fully ""get it"".  In other words, the movie can be a bit confusing.  There are also some parts of the film that ""drag on"", but it doesn't take away from the overall effect of the movie.  One of the best scenes is the underwater sequence, which is just plain eerie.  There is one scene that involves cats.  I love cats and having them as pets, might make this scene a bit hard to watch.  Nevertheless, many aspects of Argento's films have a ""pseudo-fake"" quality about them, so you always know in the back of your head that what is happening on the screen isn't real.

As formally noted, Dario Argento's ""The Three Mothers"" trilogy is currently uncompleted.  However, the third film is supposed to be completed and released by October 2007.  The name of the movie is ""The Third Mother"".  I do hope this is fact and not a rumor.",1177977600,4,2604,4.754464285714286

anyways, a lot of underground dvd collectors are probably wondering about this new blue underground version of this movie. i say this. if you have the anchor bay version, never fear. both versions are exactly the same, save for the fact that the newly released one is region zero and the insert is doubled sided along with the clear case. the anchor bay one does come with a nice interview book insert though.  if you don't have this movie,id recommend to pick the blue underground version up.(ahem, cheaper!) if you have the anchor bay one (likewise to myself) theres no need to shell out 12 more bucks..i mean unless you plan to visit folks out of the USA or adore the clear see thru cases.

1073786,3,6305807426,"In the wake of ""Suspiria"", where Dario Argento fully committed to the visual and aesthetic possibilities of the horror genre, narrative took a back seat. Gone were the days of the tightly plotted whodunits such as ""Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" and ""Deep Red"". ""Inferno"" is symptomatic of a cinematic approach in which narrative is subservient to and in service to increasingly grand visual set pieces. ""Inferno"" more so than any horror film marked the eventual path the genre would take in the 1980's. ""Inferno"" isn't however devoid of narrative, but making sense of it is not the paramount concern of the spectator. The theme of alchemy acts as an effective metaphor for the film as whole, as Argento throws in tried and tested ingredients to create something that is startlingly dark and baroque. ""Inferno's"" narrative problems however are not it's undoing, it's as if Argento realises by the very nature of the genre that his major concern is the realisation of another world; in this case a gloomy and gothic netherworld in which the forces of evil are much closer than one expects. Full of spectacular and senseless violence ""Inferno"" reconstitutes the gothic form (made quaint and redundant by Hammer) and gives it a unique Italian sensibility.",1162598400,10,1252,5.024038461538462

So I bought it, and I've watched it twice.  The 2nd time, it really hits you.  It's a completely surreal, image driven film.  If you try to make sense of it, it won't work.  The imagery is everything, and it's outstanding.  There's not one frivolous frame in the entire film.  It's fantastic to look at.  It's not Argento's best work, but it is certainly one of his most fascinating films.  The soundtrack by Keith Emerson works very well too (I'm a massive ELP fan).  The performances are adequate, but that's not really important here.  It's a shame Argento hasn't made a decent film since 1987.  He really has some talent....",1161129600,5,861,4.549019607843137
1073788,4,6305807426,"In an age where garbage like the SAW movies and endless remakes of horror classics (The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, etc.) clutter up theaters, it's nice to be able to revisit the visionary horrors of Dario Argento.  Sure, Inferno is slow-paced by today's standards...and it's all the more terrifying for it.  Like a master painter, Argento takes time to compose each scene for maximum visual impact.  Each time I watch Inferno, I get drawn in again.

Like his masterpiece, Suspiria, Inferno isn't terribly well-acted or even conventially plotted.  But again, it's about the visual experience, the in-your-face horror.  Do your nightmares make sense?  More often than not, they don't.  And that's what the best of Argento's films do: they approximate living nightmares.  Even the music--at times discordant and jarring--adds to the unsettling feeling that Something Is Not Right Here.

It's safe to say if you're a fan of those recent movies I listed at the start of this review, you probably won't care much for Inferno.

The use of color and lighting in this film is magnificent, and the cinematography first-rate as well. The story is dark and ominous and you quickly find yourself immersed in it. I rate it right up there with ""Tenebre"", ""Suspiria"", and ""Deep Red"" as one of his finest cinematic achievements. Just awesome. Dario is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. Period. An uncompromising visionary of stellar genius. He has a vision and he does not deviate, he is unconcerned with studio execs approval or public perception of his films. Unwaivering, he makes the kind of films HE wants to make. He doesn't set out to make a commercially successful film. He doesn't compromise his ideals and sacrifice the integrity of his films by allowing their content to be edited just to please producers, or in a pathetic attempt to try to appeal to a more mainstream audience. Perhaps that's why some of his releases have been cut by nearly an hour! (In the U.S. and other countries outside of Italy.) Sadly, ""Phenomena"" was originally released in the U.S. at just 82 minutes. The U.S. version from Anchor Bay is 110 minutes. (It should be noted that this is not the complete version either. The ""integral version"" available in Italy, Holland, and Japan runs 115 minutes.) That's 28 to 33 minutes that was cut previously!! That's absolute butchery and that's sickening! The Director's original vision needs to be preserved at all costs. At any rate... Dario is an immensely talented director and ""Inferno"" is a prime example of the man at his best. No true Argento fan, or horror film buff in general, should do themselves the injustice of not owning this movie. 5 Stars, hands down. Highly recommended viewing if you enjoy dark, morbid stories with dazzling visual imagery. I wish that even 25% of the directors in Hollywood had the talent, the vision and the balls that Dario possesses. Maybe then we wouldn't be bombarded with the gutless, unimaginative, uninspiring trash that is heaved upon us month after month, year after year, by the Hollywood filmmaking community.

Of course, there's Dario's signature nightmare moments where reality seems to disintegrate into a dream passage for mysterious reasons, and as always his timing of suspense scenes is impecable.

Ulike his previous films, ""Suspiria"" and ""Deep Red"", where there was one straight forward storyline, ""Inferno"" is an assortment of set pieces that are cast aside, only to be concluded later with a prodigious, or not so prodigious death. New characters introduced, were only for the purpose of having them killed off.

Argento movies are an acquired taste. His stylistic elements, use of color and angles put him in a class all by himself. However, if this isn't your cup of tea you may be left with insipid plots. ""Inferno"" is no different. As I've stated before, if your more into a ""Scream"" type of movie then you most likely will not be impressed with this movie, however, if your fan of the stylish Argento type Italian Giallo movies then ""Inferno"" should be right up your alley.

  Inferno is one hot movie. I cannot believe how scary this movie is. It is very dark, gothic. This is one erie story fimilar to Suspiria. This time, there is less time to get to know the characters because they don't stay alive long. What I am trying to say is..there seems to be a huge difference between this and Suspiria. Suspiria had a less complex story, you got to know the characters well, it made sense. Inferno, the story is far more bizarre, you don't really see the witch often (more in 1st person views during murders..seeing gloves). This film leaves me with an uneasy feeling. It sort of makes you wonder about life. I'm not saying I believe in witches, but this opens up your mind and makes you wonder about things. The hot dog vendor was freaky.

A couple of characters stumble upon this fact through a rare book and look to figure it out.  But basically anyone who gets nosy or near that damn book is slaughtered.

Alot of people claim this film makes no sense, but I don't see why they think that.  Hell, I just told you the plot.  I think people find it confusing coz of the bizarre characters and situations that arise(the hotdog vendor thing is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a film.  I hope Dario wanted that to be funny).  But all these you can put down to witchy hocus pocus.  I'd strongly suggest watching this if you liked Suspiria.  It's gory, very colorful, bizarre and downright trippy.  And lets not forget that funky soundtrack by Keith Emerson(Da Da Do Dee Do Dee Do Dee Suspiriorum! Da Da Lachrymarum! Da Da Tenebrarum!

1073936,5,6305807426,"When I read the other reviews for Inferno, I was lead to believe that it would be a hard to understand, but stylish, mess. I have heard the term ""style over substance"" so many times in reference to Argento's films that it has become a cliche'. Inferno is one of Dario's most bizzare and unconventional narratives, but it is not incoherent. A good horror film should always be aloof or ambiguos (take Kubrick's ""The Shinning""). Horror becomes cheesy if over-explained. The scene in Suspiria when the dog rips out the blind guys throat would not have been as effective if we knew exactly why it happened, this is the difference between a great horror film and your average episode of ""Charmed"".

I personally found Inferno very unnerving and creepy. I won't spoil the plot, but in the first scene in the cellar, I sat bolt upright in anticipation.

Technically speaking, Argento is at his stylish best on this one. The lighting is great (even thought the saturated red/blue does get a little over used), the building and set pieces used were fabulous and (much to my surprise) I really enjoyed Keith Emerson's score.",1096588800,2,1114,4.766839378238342
1073937,4,6305807426,"After seeing Dario Argento's ""Inferno,"" I have moved into the final phases of seeing his entire body of work. It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a brief period of time, Argento drifted away from the tried and true giallo format to indulge in what would become known as his ""Three Mothers' Trilogy."" The first entry is ""Suspiria,"" the second ""Inferno."" The third, unfortunately, has never arrived on the scene. After watching ""Inferno,"" I must say that I prefer his giallo films.

That's not to say ""Inferno"" is a bad film--far from it. The movie introduces the viewer to a young woman living in a most mysterious house. According to a book she finds entitled ""Three Mothers,"" written by a long dead alchemist named E. Varelli, the building she currently resides in may well be one of the three structures the aforementioned alchemist built for these three mothers. Who are they? Mater Tenebrarum (the mother of darkness), Mater Suspiriorum (the mother of sighs), and Mater Lachrymarum (mother of tears) rule the world from their three abodes, effectively controlling the destinies of everyone on the planet. One of the houses sits in Freiburg, Germany, another in Rome, and the last in New York City. And wouldn't you know it? Rose (Irene Miracle), the young lady who found the book, definitely lives in an eerie building in the Big Apple. We learn most of this within the first ten minutes of the film. Unfortunately, these scenes form the only coherent segment of the movie. All bets are off after Rose learns she's probably living in the middle of an ancient, horrible evil. From this point forward, ""Inferno"" lurches from one nonsensical plot thread to another. Some of them are interesting, some of them aren't, and some fall somewhere in between.

The movie suddenly shifts focus to Rose's brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey), a student studying music in Europe. He receives an odd letter from Rose describing her suspicions about the house, so he decides to leave immediately for New York in order to lend a helping hand. Before he goes, Mark witnesses a few bizarre scenes. For instance, while listening to a piece of music in a lecture hall, he sees a beautiful young woman a few rows down staring at him. Why? Who knows, but the credits identify this woman as one of the three mothers. Too, in a short subplot that really goes nowhere, one of Mark's acquaintances that saw the letter investigates the Varelli book much to her everlasting detriment. Anyway, Mark arrives in New York only to discover his sister is missing. He thus moves into the building determined to find out exactly what is going on. In the course of his investigations, he meets up with the oddball bookseller next door, a flighty neighbor (played by Daria Nicolodi), and a few of the other stern yet creepy tenants. Rose's brother soon makes an interesting discovery, alluded to in the Varelli book, that leads him smack dab into yet another confusing series of events involving an architect with a weird talking device implanted in his throat and the Mater herself.

""Inferno"" is probably the only film I haven't worried about spoiling when writing a review. In order to spoil a film for someone, you have to know what the movie is about. I have NO IDEA what Argento tried to do here. The film eschews any conventional narrative in favor of one highly stylistic scene after another. And ""Inferno"" delves into style in a way few horror films ever achieve. You need look no further than the underwater scene at the beginning of the movie, or the cartoonishly lit interiors of the Mater's lair, or the revelatory denouement to realize this picture revels in artistically structured set pieces and situations. The flair for color and setting eclipses more than the narrative: the actors, the performances, and even the famous Argento kills disappear into the background. Sure, a couple of the characters meet their end at the claws of cats and rats, and a few knifings show up to keep you on your toes, but the main reason to watch ""Inferno"" involves enjoying the scenery and trying not to ask too many pesky questions about motivation or plot development. The movie concerns witchcraft and alchemy, two massively confusing topics, so who are we to demand answers to such supremely complicated subjects?

I liked the extras on the DVD. A nice behind the scenes documentary explains the technical difficulties behind the film. Apparently, tossing cats on Daria Nicolodi isn't as easy as it sounds, nor was the underwater scene a piece of cake. Probably the best thing about ""Inferno"" for this fan was the inclusion of a Keith Emerson soundtrack. As a huge Emerson, Lake, and Palmer aficionado, I instantly bonded with the organ/synthesizer score. Heck, a few of the songs would have fit in perfectly on a 1970's ELP album. All Argento completists will want to own ""Inferno,"" but newcomers to the man's work should probably fortify themselves with his better known (and just plain better) gialli work before diving in here.",1095292800,16,5737,4.881025641025641
1073938,5,6305807426,"Considering that Suspiria is by far the most popular and acclaimed film in Argento's catalogue I'm rather confused as to why the sequel Inferno isn't more popular.  Fans of Suspiria, like myself, ought to eat this up. Admittedly, it isn't as good as Suspiria, but it takes all the things that made that film so extraordinary and unusual and pushes them boundaries even further, while managing to be a fairly distinct from it's predecessor. This is most definitely a worthwhile piece in and of itself, and it is a must see for any horror fan, or those who enjoy visually startling films.

Visually, Inferno is even more stylized then Suspiria, with virtually nothing being shot in a perfuntory or realistic manner. It takes the most prominent visual aspect of Suspiria, the bright, garish sets and surreal colored lighting,(most often red and blue) and takes them to a greater extreme, and in a slightly different direction.  In Suspiria, the set design and colored lighting were relatively simple, generally using open areas and relatively simple lighting, frequently with the entire scenes bathed in a single color.(And it rarely become more complicated than simply having 2 colors for the background, and 1 more illuminating the characters in the foreground) Thus, for all it's eeriness, the lighting in Suspiria actually illuminated the scene quite well. Not so in Inferno.  The sets are cramped and elaborate, with numerous different light sources illuminating small portions of the scenes, generally with much of the scene still shrouded in darkness.(often to the point which you can't easily identify objects)  Thus, although Inferno has many of the visual elements of Suspiria, they are used in a notably different style. Personally, I think that Inferno looks even better then its predecessor. The most notable scene, visually, is when Rose is attacked in her apartment.  It is simply astounding.

This film is not big on plot or character development. In fact, I would say that it has perhaps the least character development of any film I've seen. (none) And to my surprise, I think this is actually a slight problem. Although Suspiria wasn't too big on character development, it managed to make me genuinely like Suzy and Sarah, whereas I don't give a damn about anyone in this film. And this actually makes the horror scenes less effective. The plot extends the mythos of Suspiria, with Rose reading a book, The Three Mothers, in the opening scene. The book states that 3 sisters rule the world, Mater Suspiriorum, Mater Tenebrarum and Mater Lachymarum, and that they live in Freiburg, Rome and New York respectively.(Naturally, Mater Suspiriorum was Helena Marcos in Suspiria)  And she discovers that, wouldn't ya know it, she's living in the apartment complex in which Mater Tenebrarum resides.(She lives underneath it though, not in one of the apartments.) She's disturbed by this story and calls for help from her brother, Mark, living in Rome. Thus, an investigation is begun by various individuals, generally leading to their untimely deaths. As you might imagine, the plot is driven by absurdities and contrivances almost exclusively. But I don't care, and neither should you, considering the film and its goals.  It can be a bit confusing at times as well, but you ought not worry about that, for the reasons stated above.

The murder sequences are very elaborate and nicely done, in much the same magnificently colored and hallucinogenic slasher film manner found in Suspiria, this time generally with taloned, cowled killers.  They do have some slight flaws, however. Most significantly, they lack much of the sheer intensity and brutality of the killings in Suspiria. (Sorry about the endless comparisons, but they practically beg to be done) Simply put, the victims in Inferno are, for the most part, not made to suffer the way they did in Suspiria.  Some people found the more sadistic aspect of Suspiria offensive, but that's what gave the deaths there power.  Naturally, the most affecting death is the most painful seeming one, where the victim has their head pinned down through an open window, and the broken window pane repeatedly dropped on their throat.  The visualization of this event leaves something to be desired, but it is conceptually nasty enough to make it work very well. Still, all the other deaths are beautifully shot and staged, even if they aren't as painful or personally affecting. Another problem is that they attempt a few more animal attacks, with little success.  There is a cat attack, which is unintentionally humorous, and a massed rat attack which is just kinda bland. Fortunately, that is not all that is going on in those scenes, and they are still excellent sequences overall.

One of the most famous aspects of Suspiria was its extraordinary score by the band Goblin.  Here Keith Emerson takes over scoring duties, and takes them in a different, somewhat more conventional direction, with lots of omionous, discordant piano pieces.  Though not as effective as Goblin's work, it still works quite well, and is preferable to merely attempting a retread of the previous score. It uses the old trick of having a vicious murder contrasted with a grandiose, incongruent classical piece,(to great effect) and I also particularly enjoy the rock version of some Verdi piece they use during the cab scene.(It's cheesy, but I like it)

Sadly, the end of this film is somewhat anti-climatic.(Though to a lesser extent than was Suspiria)  It's primarily hurt by the fact that it has a conceptually solid but incredibly hokey visual effect during the confrontation with Mater Tenebrarum. It's also hurt by the fact that the evil is defeated not by the actions of any of the protagonists, but just through luck and chance.

Well, that's about it. Somewhat flawed, but the flaws don't matter much.  If you haven't seen Suspiria yet, see it first. If you like that, check this out.",1091491200,11,5925,5.03680981595092
1073939,3,6305807426,"I am a huge fan of Suspiria and Dario Argento so naturally after seeing Suspiria I rushed out and bought this. I knew this installment couldn't really match up to Suspiria but to tell you the truth I couldn't help but be a little dissapointed. Here are some of my likes/dislikes with the film.
LIKES:
Dario's direction and sense of style have not changed and the set pieces and shots in the film are top notch.
The kill count nearly doubles in this installment which leads to some very good moments, and some not as good. But nothing horrible (I mean you gotta love that hot dog vendor scene). And although the music may not be as creepy the suspense is still very much there.
The elaboration on the plot (although still a little confusing) is always nice.
DISLIKES:
The music bugged me a lot and is by far my number 1 compaint with this film and basically why I gave a 3 instead of a 4. This may seem trivial but the heart pumping masterwork in Suspiria gripped you and kept you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. The score in Inferno just fails to do this and is mostly just a soft piano score which loosens the tension and atmosphere for a lot of the film.
The only other thing that bugged me enough to mention was a few of the killings. I mean as I stated earlier I like most of them but they failed to match up to the grandiose masterpieces in Suspiria. More deaths are always good but it seems in some cases they exchanged quality for quantity. Moreover the back on the DVD says it's uncut but particularily in one of the scenes it fades out rather abruptly which bugged me because it was probably the best death in the film (I speaking of the window scene where Rose is killed).

OVERALL:
Despite a few areas most of the aspects of this movie are quite enjoyable and I highly reccomend this, especially to fans of Suspiria and Dario Argento.",1073088000,,1864,4.310541310541311
1073940,4,6305807426,"I stumbled upon the twisted and surreal world of Dario Argento completely by accident. I am a horror movie affecionado and when I got my DVD player (soon upgrading to Blu-Ray) I was eager in purchasing as many horror films as possible- well at least the good ones. Unfortunately that's when I realized they're aren't that many good ones out there at all. Aside from the obvious classics - ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Shining"", ""Halloween"" etc I couldn't bring myself to purchase the other, countless horror trash- sure they make an entertaining viewing when they're shown on T.V but spending your hard earned cash on them is a little harder to do. That's where Dario comes in. Amazon.com steered me in his direction during my countless Amazon.com horror movie searches and I'm glad they did. Since then, I've purchased many of his more popular films namely ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", ""Tenebrae"", ""Inferno"", ""Phenomena"" and ""Opera"". Hollywood rarely makes movies like these anymore and the movie that comes to mind that is comparable in style is Brian de Palma's ""Dressed to Kill"".

""Inferno"" is Argento's second entry in his Three Mother's Trilogy, the first being the now classic ""Suspiria"". The story takes place in New York City where a beautiful young woman stumbles upon a book written by an alchemist who was responsible in building the dwelling places of the three infernal mothers. These three otherworldly women are evil sisters who control the world and are set in Germany, Italy and the US- New York City. Anyone who dares to investigate the book is brutally murdered by diabolical forces. Many critics have complained about the confusing plot of ""Inferno"" and not many have understood it. They have complained about the plot holes and confusing plot twists and with good reason. Even repeated viewings won't help answer many of the unanswered questions that remain however, the film is so stylish and so beautifully filmed, you almost have to surrender to its mysteries. For the Argento curiousity seeker, I recommend viewing the film as is, without digging too deep into the story. In my opinion, a good horror/suspense film should always leave you with questions unanswered. Do you really want every little detail explained to you like most, if not all of today's horror films? I don't. Argento does not give in to the viewers curiosity and created this tantalizing tale with twists, surreal images and style to boot. Even critics have commented on the visually stunning set pieces which include a flooded ball room holding many sinister secrets, ghostly drapes, twisted stairways, dark corridors with glowing eyes peeping through and like ""Suspiria"", a whole array of visually stimulating colours are thrown in to assault the senses and they adorn the film to great effect. Whatever you think of the story, there is no denying Argento's trademark style is at it's best in ""Inferno"".

""Phenomena"" is another Argento gem that needs to be viewed and not just by horror fans because it is not really a horror film. It's more of a disturbing fairy tale with the classically beautiful maiden, in this case the very young Jennifer Connelly, a murderous monster (or two), and several million insects. The story deals with a gifted young student who is sent to an all girls school in Switzerland. The beautiful Swiss landscapes is suddenly stained red with the blood of these innocent young girls as a monstrous killer lurks within the picturesque landscape. However little does our killer know that our heroine is able to control, through the use of mind power, insects who she manages to manipulate in order to find the killer. She is referred to in the film as ""Beelzebub - Lord of the Flies"". Throw in a very smart Chimp with a straigh-razor, several thousand maggots, a detective fly, Argento's special brand of horror magic and you have a wonderfully morbid fairy tale. Other pluses include the gorgeous Swiss location, a  beautiful Jennifer Connelly in the beginning of her career and a film score which adds to the films dream-like quality. All combine to make ""Phenomena"" beautifully eerie!

Both of these films are greatly recommended to anyone wanting to break out of the ordinary mold of your standard Hollywood horror movie. The plot to both of these films are extremely over the top, maybe a bit on the confusing side, hardly believable but it takes someone like Dario Argento to make all of these odd elements work. They all come together like some sort of surreal, abstract painting to be viewed and enjoyed with an open mind.",1067644800,,4553,4.955497382198953
1073941,5,6305807426,"Dario Argento's INFERNO, the sequel to the great SUSPIRIA, is the director's most difficult film; it was hard for him to pull this one off and it took a lot of time. In the end, however, it was all well worth the effort. INFERNO establishes its link to SUSPIRIA in the beginning, as Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS fame) reads the book ""The Three Mothers"" by one E. Varelli, an architect and alchemist who built three houses for the Three Mothers, who are really evil beings who rule the world through sorrows, darkness and tears. Rose, in fact, might live in one of those dwelling places, a hotel in New York, which is the dwelling place of Mater Tenebrarum, Mother of Darkness. (SUSPIRIA covered Mater Suspiriorum, Mother of Sighs/Sorrows.) Anyway, her brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey) comes to New York and gets caught up in the weirdness that ensues.
As I said before, Dario Argento had a real difficult time filming INFERNO. He bypassed the witchcraft of SUSPIRIA in favor of alchemy for this story. Fortunately, he had help from another Italian horror legend: Mario Bava (TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE, BLACK SUNDAY, SHOCK), who filmed an amazing underwater sequence in the beginning which is a sight to behold and is really scary. Some think that the music student with the cat (Ania Pieroni of TENEBRE and Fulci's HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY) in the scenes in Rome is a representation of Mater Lacrimaurum, Mother of Tears; if that's so, what a great setup for the third film that would have been. While not as mind-blowing as SUSPIRIA, INFERNO is a wild experience in its own right and has an equally awesome music score (here by prog-rock vet Keith Emerson) and scary imagery and lighting reminiscent of an EC Comic book.
BTW: Have you noticed any similarity between this and Fulci's masterpiece THE BEYOND? I mean there's the house that maybe concealing some sort of evil, there's the gruesome murders at random, and there's the awesome score! Anyway, you have to see THE BEYOND, and I'll explain why in another review. But give INFERNO, Argento's purest film, a try but watch SUSPIRIA first so you'll understand this movie better!",1066435200,3,2145,4.815718157181572
1073942,3,6305807426,"Good stylish Argento movie dating back to 1980. Yet something wrong. Maybe the plot, too close to that of 1976 Suspiria, of which Inferno is probably an ideal sequel, but not as whipping and fascinating. The academy school has been replaced by a groomy building, nest of Mater Tenebrarum, one of the three Mothers who rule the world. The impression is that something is missing, probably the final part of the mothers trilogy, which began with Mother Suspiriorum in 1976. Superb cinematography and juicy episodes, such as the cellar immersion of the protagonist or the double gore murder of Eleonora Giorgi and Gabriele Lavia, whose screams mix up with Verdi's Nabucco. I expected something better from the solution of it all, but your nerves will be whipped from the very beginning up to the whole development of the movie.
Good job from Anchor Bay Ent., with a widescreen presentation (1.85:1) enhanced for 16x9 TV's, the audio track is only in english language, but in 5.1 Dolby Sorround. The extra features are essential, with an exclusive Dario Argento interview (which begins before the film starts, but cannot be selected from the menu), the theatrical trailer, a still gallery and the talent bios. Good exercise of tension with a great score from Keith Emerson, excellent style and fascinating colours.",1052784000,2,1310,5.04147465437788

1073944,4,6305807426,"Dario Argento is the godfather of Italian horror! Inferno is, in my opinion, one of his finest movies. If you're in it for the gore, buy Deep Red instead. However, if you love occult flicks where the horror is symbolic and on a grander, more menacing scale, you might just enjoy this. The movie revolves around the three mothers, women of unspeakable power who control the fate of entire cities. The key to discovering their secret lies in the pages of an alchemist's book, but those secrets seem to cost the lives of all who try to uncover them. There is quite a bit of violence and blood for those who enjoy it, and plenty of mystery and intrigue. This film should be savored like a fine wine.",1049328000,,695,4.4375
1073945,4,6305807426,"Excerpt from the Three Mothers:  ""I Varelli, an architect living in London, met the Three Mothers and designed and built for them three dwelling places, one in Rome, one in New York, and the third in Freiborg, Germany.  I failed to discover until too late that from those three locations, the three mother ruled the world with sorrow, tears, and darkness.  Mater Suspiriorum, the mother or sighs and the oldest of the three, lives at Freiborg.  Mater Lachrymarum, the mother of tears and the most beautiful of the sisters, holds rule in Rome.  Mater Tenebrarum, the mother of darkness, who is the youngest and cruellest of the three, controls New York.  And I built their horrible houses, the repository of all their filthy secrets...""
That is what Rose Elliott, living in an apartment building in New York, discovers in an ancient book sold to her by Kazanian, an antiques dealer and later, as we learn, rabid ailurophobe--fear of cats.  She realizes that she lives in one of the three houses and sets out to unlock the riddle.  However, she is brutally killed, but not before sending a letter to her brother Mark, who is studying music in Rome.
Mark, distracted by a sultry woman with a huge dirty white Persian, forgets the letter at the music auditorium.  His classmate Sarah reads it, and calls Mark.  When he gets to her place, he finds her murdered.  He arrives in New York and gets mixed up in what his sister was investigating.
The scene preceding Rose's death is one of the eeriest, with windows lit hellish red, shimmering blue lights dancing along the walls, lightning, and glass breaking with the rain pouring in.  It climaxes with her gory demise.
Another is when Rose drops her keys in a pool and diving to get them, finds a weird room underwater.  Actress Irene Miracle clearly put her talents as an experienced underwater swimming to good use.
Two other characters meet with even worse deaths.  Elise, Rose's neighbour, has a, well, CAT-astrophic fate.  It's a highlight of this movie.  Cats feature a lot in this movie, BTW.  Ditto Kazanian, only worse, and with a different animal.  The casualty rate in this film is higher than in Argento's Profondo Rosso and Suspiria.
Although not mentioned, the girl with the cat was Mater Lachrymarum, and wordlessly played to perfection by Ania Pieroni.  Check the closeups of her blue eyes.  Two alumni from Profondo Rosso appear:  Gabriele Lavia and Daria Niccolodi.  As in Rosso, Lavia plays a character named, yes, Carlo.  Daria Niccolodi (Elise) was Gianna in PR and was the ex-wife of Dario Argento and mother of Asia Argento.  Alida Valli (the desk woman) came out in Suspiria as the menacing Miss Tanner.
One superlative visual effect was done by Mario Bava, and that was the transformation scene of Mater Tenebrarum.  Not bad for a period without digital graphics technology.
Keith Emerson's (of Emerson-Lake-Palmer) piano score captures the eerie atmosphere of this film, as does his Latin choir in the Mater Tenebrarum song near the film's end and credits.
The second in Dario Argento's as-yet uncompleted Three Mothers trilogy, while not as visually grabbing as Suspiria, still maintains horrific deaths and images, lots of blood, whispering voices, and menacing hands.  And Leigh McCloskey (Mark) comes across as unassertive and undynamic.  Still, a laudable effort from Argento.",1042243200,5,3350,4.946332737030412

1074031,5,6305807426,"People often criticise this film, complaining about the lack of drama and story. These people do not truly understand what this film is. It isn't the regular teen fodder to give you laughs and cheap thrills. Like Fulci's THE BEYOND, it's an exercise in pure cinema. It's a film about the images, symbols, shifting patterns of light and music. All these elements are placed together to pose certain cryptic riddles that are seemingly never revealed. Interspersed between these enigmas are moments of cinematic lyricism. We are constantly surprised by amazing shapes, colours, patterns of light. Because the enigmas regarding the truth of the legend of the 3 mothers are indecipherable, and because the clues are foregrounded to an extent in the film style, we are constantly forced to try and work things out which cannot be answered. This futility of the film's truth takes us to a meta-cinematic truth. We find out through this why the actual film was made. The reason being that the language of cinema isn't sufficient to spell out truths, it is primal. It is ultimately beyond language, and beyond time and space. Argento's film is oneiric, and is an exercise in poetic sensation. This film evokes feelings in me that are sensational, overwhelming, feelings that cannot be explained. Maybe they mean nothing, or everything. But INFERNO shows that the mechanics of cinema evoke a purer, non-language, profound sensory expression.",1031875200,7,1431,5.119658119658119
1074032,5,6305807426,"Phenomena hooked me right away, even the momentary twinge I felt when the monkey made its appearance (I hate monkeys, especially monkeys in ""horror"" movies) was short lived; this monkey is actually a device to move the plot along and never overstayed its welcome.  The tension continues to build up, right up to the end, which was a nice surprise.  Many elements from prior Argento films make appearances here and everything just works.
Inferno is the third and final chapter of the Deep Red trilogy and the second and, so far, final chapter in the proposed Three Mothers trilogy.  Inferno suffers from the ""Jan Brady"" syndrome.  She is beautiful and accomplished in her own right, but she follows an even more beautiful and equally accomplished sister.  It is easy to be so dazzled by Suspiria that Inferno is obscured in her shadow.  But upon a second viewing, the scales fall and the ears become unplugged and Inferno proves to be her sisters equal.  Its simply that Suspiria is a fairy-tale whereas Inferno is a symphony.
Phenomena includes a trailer, a couple of music videos, the first of which is absolutely mesmerizing, and an interview.
Inferno includes an introduction by Dario Argento, that unfortunately comes off as an apology, a trailer, and an interview segment.
This gift set, in fact, all three volumes of the Dario Argento collection, represent a tremendous value.  Just compare the price of buying these two DVD's separately.  This is now the DVD's golden age.  Enjoy it while it lasts.",1006387200,9,1505,4.913043478260869

After all, it features a great score by Keith Emerson, has some very eye-catching parts (mainly the under water room and the alchemist in the library). It also features the wonderful Daria Nicolodi (also in Deep Red and Tenebre).
I suggest first time viewers try renting this film first, as you may find yourself highly disappointed.  Although, for Argento fans it's a must, and over time you will probably find yourself appreciating the over all artistic expression that was put into the film.",1004486400,,808,4.962962962962963
1074034,4,6305807426,"Because if you see it during the afternoon you will laugh hysterically.  This is not to say that horror was not meant to be watched during the day.  King Kong terrified me as did every version of the Mummy ever made (except the Indiana Jones one with B.F. that came out not too long ago).
  Argento's ""Inferno"", if viewed late night however, is a force to be reckoned with.  The story line sort of picks up where Susperia left off.  Don't try to read too much into it, because the more you try to understand it, the more frustrated you will be with some of the odd characters who appear maybe once or twice and then vanish with no explanation as to identity or motive what so ever.
  But, I rated this movie four stars!-as to where it succeeds, it does so brilliantly in where Argento's dialog and characters leave off.  He says more with one image of an empty hotel room under water (and makes more sense at that) than the paragraphs of exposition he devotes to explaining the Three Sisters.  The real horror is in the architecture, not as an active menace, but as a latent malevolent force.  Argento's set designs are flawless; I loved his spartan use of color against the many shades of darkness throughout the film's mostly gloomy sets.
  As for one of the sisters who finally manifests herself, well . . . we'll just have to wait until the third installment to see if more sense can be made of this mythology-if and when Argento ever crafts one.",1004054400,,1450,4.446969696969697

""Inferno"" is no exception; it holds your attention from start to finish, and if you weren't fascinated by it, you have to be a pretty dull person.  So the plot is not crystal clear,who cares?  Argento has never specialized in the plot department.  But, contrary to what many people think, Argento's movies DO have substance are not just fanciful exercises in style. Argento, more than any horror director I've ever seen, evokes a sense of the marvelous and otherworldly:his films point away from the commonplace, the ordinary, and push us in the direction of the unknown. Half the people who bash this movie probably couldn't take their eyes off it while it was actually playing.  True, some of the dialogue is ludicrous and the scene at the end with the 'grim reaper' was absurd, but the sheer magic and intrigue of the movie make its flaws unimportant.  Argento is to horror cinema what Lovecraft, Poe or Kafka are to horror literature.  I find it hard to believe that the 'fans' who dismiss this movie because of qualms they have over it 'not making sense' or the incomprehensible nature of the plot were Argento fans to begin with: the premise of the movie is neither more nor less ludicrous than the plots of his other movies.  Argento's work is not meant to be logically coherent or rational, but to penetrate the mystical, shadowy side of existence.  You will never see a more visually stunning or visionary horror movie.

1074036,4,6305807426,"A combination of alchemy, witchcraft, architecture and horror, director Dario Argento's Inferno is a pulsing thriller filled
with murder, supernatural mayhem and atmosphere so thick you could slash through it with a knife. The peculiar proceedings are set into motion in both New York and Rome when two young women, Sara (Eleonora Giorgi) and Rose (Irene Miracle), find a book called The Three Mothers, a tome of alchemy written by an architect named Varelli. According to the book, Varelli built a trio of resting places for the Three Mothers, an evil trio whose identities remain at the core of the film's mystery. If you listen closely, you can hear the identity of the first mother, who's domain was visited in the previous Argento film SUSPIRIA. Rose's brother and Sara's boyfriend is Mark (Leigh McCloskey--remember him from Dallas and Just One of the Guys?), a music student in Rome who jets to New York after Sara is murdered and Rose disappears. He follows up Rose's research on The Three Mothers and, with the help of his sister's neighbor Elise (Daria Nicolodi, Argento's girlfriend), comes to the realization that the building they are in is one of Varelli's. Along the way, Mark encounters a variety of quirky characters including Elise's butler (Leopoldo Mastelloni), the building's maid (Alida Valli), a cat-hating book-seller named Kazanian (Sacha Pitoeff), the infirm Professor Arnold (Feodor Chaliapin) and his nurse (Veronica Lazar). After a series of murders and a revelation that the butler and the maid have been plotting to steal Elise's jewels, Mark discovers a secret series of passages within the building. They lead him to its core where he finds the wheelchair-bound Professor Arnold--who explains that he is really the architect Varelli. After a violent struggle, the dying old man confesses to Mark that he is merely a servant to the Mothers. The building begins to burn out of control, but before Mark can escape, he discovers the shocking identity of the Three Mothers.
This is considered to be the sequel to Suspiria, although it's never really quite clearly stated as such.....one of the problems with this film is it's lack of explanations for some of the murders (and several other situations...)....I guess you are supposed to think that everyone is under the control of the Three Mothers? As usual, Argento's style reigns over substance. The color, the camera angles, the overall pace and storytelling, the viscousness of the murders. The mythos of the Three Mothers is very interesting..I think it could have been explored more. The third Mother, a beautiful brunette stroking a cat and whispering spells, appears as Mark read's his sister's letter in Rome...could she be the subject of the last of the proposed trilogy? Hopefully someday. There are some great effects in the film too....particularly at the end when the identity of the third mother is revealed. Extras on the DVD include the usual trailers and an interview with Argento. The booklet has an interview with Leigh McCloskey.
All in all, I really liked this film, but I couldn't really recommend it for everyone......you need to be a fan of Argento's style and have a certain amount of patience and acceptance to enjoy it fully!",1002758400,8,3231,5.063789868667917

While this is certainly not one of Dario's worst it is certainly not his best but it's good enough to keep from being just a mediocre movie. What little plot there is concerns a young woman named Rose (Irene Miracle) who is doing some research on the building she lives in and she disocovers it was built by a man who had some associations with a trio of witches for whom he built three buildings. In the first SUSPIRIA you see the first building which is the dancing academy and in this one the building we are in now is in New York City. Each building for each witch. They are called The Three Mothers. When she begins to suspect something unusual in the building she lives in she writes to her brother in Rome to come and visit her (when the movie switches over to Rome we briefly see the third witch, she is the one holding the cat). Soon after her brother Mark ( a bland Leigh McClosky) goes to New York City only to find out she has dissappeared. Soon after the movie becomes a series of situations that don't really mean anything. While the movie's cinematography and use of primary colors are very beautiful and the sets and special effects are very impressive the movie suffers from two things: a script that does not make any sense (this script is filled with too much nonsense, even for Dario to whom the plot never really makes much difference) and a bland leading man. Leigh McClosky is one of the blandest actors i have ever seen and therefore it is hard for the auddience to really care about him. The supporitng cast is pretty good though. Alida Valli (SUSPIRIA,THE THIRD MAN) returns but to play another role as the building's landlord. And Dario's girlfriend Daria Nicolodi works with him for the second time. She plays a sick Countess who lives in the building. And the musical score by Keith Emerson is very good. But like my title says, Inferno is long on style but not on logic and subtance. But compared to Argento's other dogs (TRAUMA, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) this seems like a masterpiece. Dario has yet to finish his trilogy about The Three Mothers. Here's hoping the third one is better.",995328000,5,2339,4.480093676814988

The film had a true sense of Argento's style with flash, bizzare murders set to the creepiest music and lighting, but unlike Deep Red, this movie made no sense whatsoever!  Even with seeing Suspiria before Inferno, this movie made no sense.  I'm not saying the movie was bad, because the muders were shot in such a true Argento style, that you had to like them.  So many questions of this flick were left unanswered.  What was up with the hot dog vendor?  What was up with the ending?  Who knows...maybe we'll find out when Argento finishes the trilogy up.  I reccommend this flick to seasoned Argento fans, or those who have seen Suspiria, but don't make this your first Argento film, start with Deep Red.",990316800,3,757,4.548148148148148
1074136,2,6305807426,"...and hang his head in shame for this subpar horror movie. Maybe I should have taken a cue from the brief introduction by Argento before ""Inferno"" started where he mildly praised the movie that I was in for a bumpy ride, because in a previous interview (at the end of ""Deep Red,"" actually) he claimed he ""didn't keep"" any of his films.  I thought, ""Oh great, he's trying to butter me up for what's ahead.""
So, after seeing ""Suspiria,"" ""Tenebrae,"" and ""Deep Red,"" I was expecting something on the level of those horrors but instead got a terribly incoherent supernatural thriller (I guess).  To some degree, it can be said that Lucio Fulci did a little ribbing on ""Inferno"" to make ""The Beyond,"" but at least that movie was big, overblown horror fun that didn't wallow in the pompousity of its own artsiness.
The ""plot"" has something to do with the legend of ""The Three Mothers"" and an American music student who's searching for his sister but finds death instead.  The movie is basically set up in the opening credits, and even if you can follow that brief expelling of information, you'll still wind up confused...and more likely frustrated...by everything that goes on.
Argento, who made some of the best Italian horrors of the 1970s, seems curiously defanged here.  Even the maestro's usually eye-opening set pieces lack the urgency of his previous films.  Any fans of Italian horror will want to see this, at least once, but this is hardly Argento's best work.",982713600,11,1465,4.774703557312253

I know someone is going to have a death warrant out on me now, but I have to say that the Goblin soundtracks for ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"" sometimes JUST DIDN'T WORK. They are interesting, true, but never really help scare me. I am a very traditional as far as soundtracks go (among my faves are the soundtracks of Danny Elfman, and Worjech Kelar's soundtrack to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""), so the piano-and-string scary music Keith Emerson arranged for ""Inferno"" is just right. Also, the story in ""Inferno"" also actually explains the Three Mothers, which ""Suspiria"" did not. In addition, there were more scares in ""Inferno"" than in ""Suspiria"". There were actually scenes that made me catch my breath. On the other hand, the main characters, for the most part, are very boring and shallow. But isn't that the case in most Argento films?

1074138,3,6305807426,"OK, nobody watches a Dario Argento movie expecting a great plot. Its just the immense style and care he handles his movies with. So just about everyone can easily lose track of the plot and concentrate on the gracefully-staged killings and highly original (sometimes outragous) story elements. The problem with INFERNO is that (despite the fact it has some nice Argento touches, some great scenes involving an underwater chamber and an old man getting eaten by an army of rats), the plot is so thin that in this case you tend to somewhat ignore SOME of the Argento trademarks and start wondering what the hell is going on!
An American music fan returns home from Rome after getting an urgent call from his sister. By the time he returns, she's already dead so he handles the case himself finding the SUSPIRIA-type killer which somehow relates to an evil myth.
INFERNO isn't really such a bad film. With horror maestro, Mario Bava giving it his last shot with the special effects (he died the same year), the film has some kind of punch and, though it is fairly slow, it feasts the eyes with some nice imagery but as I said, it just DOSN'T MAKE SENSE. Argento helped Bava's son, Lamberto on DEMONS five years later which I found a little bit more fun.",974160000,5,1250,4.609865470852018

It'll be excellent for those ready to accept a surrealistic film and be poor for those looking for hight tech effects & true plot. I have to admit that I personally very much enjoyed it. I saw this movie first when I was some 14 and it had a considerable effect on me. Actually I could never forget the scene with the rotting body at the ""basement"" (and was careful enough to avoid stepping on any sewer top for years...). Since than a good 15 years has passed so I was a bit sceptic whether the movie could still have the same effect on me. It almost could. But there was something completely disturbing: the dubbing. During the whole movie I saw the guys standing next to their microphones, with pages in their hands, reading a text. As if it was a kind of a penalty for them. This never happened to me before but it almost ruined the whole atmosphere of the film. I'll switch to Italien the next time I watch it -not understanding a word-  only to see if there's a difference. I won't lose much anyway since the movie is more built on visuals/sound rather than on conversations.

1074142,4,6305807426,". . . and that's just as it should be.  I disagree with those who say the  plot is hard to follow. It's more that there is no plot, just a series of  events, some more understandably connected than others.  This film is close  to being an exercise in pure surrealism.  It's as if Argento threw up his  hands and said, ""Screw it.  I usually have a hard time managing a  coherent storyline, so this time I'm not even going to worry about it.  I'm  just going to construct a vague framework and go nuts with the nightmare  imagery that is my forte and have a great time.""  Which of course  would have been disastrous if it wasn't for the fact that Argento is a  brilliantly imaginative visual stylist.  To paraphrase Pauline Kael's  review of David Lynch's The Elephant Man, this is not the usual movie where  narrative is the glue that holds everything together; here, imagery is all.  Argento holds you rapt with one entrancing, eerie and dreamlike scene  after another.  There's also one inspired moment of black humor when a man  being attacked by rats--well, I don't want to give it away.  Suffice to say  it's a great joke that very wittily subverts your movie-watching  expectations and (it seems to me) makes a satirical comment about New York  at the same time.",962755200,,1267,4.544642857142857
1074143,3,6305807426,"INFERNO

(Italy - 1980)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

Though prized by many Dario Argento fans as one of the director's major works, INFERNO emerges as a real disappointment. Abandoning the dictates of a cohesive narrative (which distinguished the giallo epics that made his name), Argento relishes the opportunity to strip INFERNO down to the bare essentials: Leigh McCloskey is  an American music student in Rome who returns home to New York to look for his sister (Irene Miracle) who's gone missing in a neo-Gothic apartment building where deadly supernatural forces hold sway.

This 'bare bones' scenario allows Argento to concentrate exclusively on a series of loosely-connected set-pieces, each self-contained and virtually independent of the main thematic framework. For reasons which will delight some and  mystify others, characters react to extraordinary events in completely  unrealistic ways: Miracle discovers a rotting corpse in a hidden room in the basement and fails to contact the police. Likewise, McCloskey is drugged into unconsciousness while searching the building and dismisses the experience as though it were nothing. A ghostly Ania Pieroni turns up in the middle of McCloskey's music class, completely unobserved by anyone else, whispering something unintelligible before drifting away on a gust of supernatural wind. And so on.

With characterisations, plot and - most importantly - drama sacrificed in favor of dream-like set-pieces, it's virtually impossible to get a handle on the proceedings, and for all its  mayhem and visual beauty, it simply lies there and dies there. Perversely, the film's refusal to operate in a conventional narrative manner and to supply concrete answers to most of its mysteries has provided plenty of ammunition for intellectual movie students over the years (Maitland McDonagh provides a good account of INFERNO's subtextual concerns in her book 'Broken Mirrors Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'). But anyone simply looking for a good story, well told, are best advised to look elsewhere.

But don't despair: When INFERNO works, it sings! There's a genuinely terrifying moment when a supernatural presence makes itself known in the apartment of Eleonora Giorgi, one of  McCloskey's fellow music students - Argento's use of sound and imagery during this sequence is extraordinarily effective, particularly his use of 'Va Pensiero' from Verdi's 'Nabucco' as an aural counterpoint to the on-screen horrors. The subsequent assault on Giorgi and Gabriele Lavia (a helpful neighbor who comforts Giorgi following her hair-raising encounter with a spectral killer at the local library!) is brilliantly ochestrated, and so is the pay-off when McCloskey stumbles on the gruesome aftermath. INFERNO achieves greatness during moments like this, but it can't sustain itself over feature length, and the result is one of Argento's least memorable achievements.",959212800,4,2949,5.560267857142857
1074144,4,6305807426,"Most fans of Dario Argento are perfectly aware of his strengths and weaknesses as a filmmaker. More than any other film in his canon of work, ""Inferno"" stands as a summation of these. Being his most beautiful film, it is also one of his most aggravating. The narrative is intermediary, resembling the ""structure"" of some Lucio Fulci's more famous films such as ""City of the Living Dead"" and ""The Beyond"". In fact, ""Inferno"" even goes beyond those boundaries of loose narrative threads. However, Argento has always been a much more canny filmmaker, and with the aid of an uncredited Mario Bava, he has created some of the most haunting imagery in horror films. The best scenes of the film are the ones that have long silent passages, primarily the ones involving Irene Miracle's character, Rose. The underwater sequence, and later where she is pursued by an unseen assailant in a dilapidated section of her apartment building are astonishing. One the most interesting aspects of ""Inferno"" is how tranquil this film is despite the gory mayhem and Keith Emerson's score. Unfortunately, there is a germ of a story here, and it drags the film down. In this respect, Argento should studied Bava's films like ""Lisa and the Devil"", which handled the surreal and fantastic in an interesting and layered fashion. ""Inferno"", on the other hand, provides only a series of clumsily strung together episodes, and naturally the film as a whole comes up much less than the sum its parts. Equally disappointing is Argento's flat treatment of his witchcraft/alchemy premise. Like ""Suspiria"", the story is reduced to a simplified conflict of good vs. evil. Not helping matters is the fact that the viewer has no emotional investment in any of the characters. The actors primarily occupy space on the screen reciting the most ludicrous dialogue I've heard in a while. Despite its flaws, ""Inferno"" is well worth seeing for its formal elements alone. Yet, if you're new to Argento, don't start here. See ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", or ""Tenebre"" first.",957916800,2,2024,4.991124260355029
7894881,3,6305807426,"Okay, so I'm probably gonna get a lot of flack for this review. However, I think of the  "",Three Mothers trilogy"", along with being a follow up to Suspiria, this was very lackluster in my opinion. Also due to the fact that the trailer that I have seen, which is the one that is also an Amazon. Not saying I watch just the one on Amazon is when a google in porno trailer almost every death is in the commercial. So when it comes to. When and what is going to happen? Even if you don't know the story, you know how they're going to die one day got to die and the fashion and style of which it is going to be. I do like this movie. But considering this is the follow up to Suspiria which, when I think of a great horror movie, it does not matter that it is a Dario Argento film even though this is technically. The movie to me false plot because you see the trailer and you expect it to be non stop over the top kill after kill and a certain fashion horror. And the movie was more like Hitchcock with the Italian horror style. Also, I really got tired of the way the film was scored, I e the sound track and the fact that 50 percent of the film had no dialogue that's. The movie? Or if I am watching a film, it is not an English and it's done in a certain matter, but I don't want to sit there and listen to a movie filled with opera type music what it is a horror film, it's either make it or see or make it scary, but don't make it over the top opera music and. Have portrait simulated stabbing scenes is how I would describe the murders. Am I upset that I bought this? No, because to get this on DVD or blue ray. It's like 25 dollars, and I don't have many of Dario Argento films on Blu ray DVD or even digitally. And I still like that, but I think if you're going to go into what I've read about the film, it's in the top 50 best horror films of all time. I would only base that on the fact that just for horfilm. Or, for the fact that the 3 mothers trilogy Suspiria, which is the first film com inferno, second film co and mother of tears, the third, and I think final film are stand out for a trilogy that spans almost 30 years. Would I buy this again now that I watch it again definitely. I definitely jumped. What was meant to be scary? And there definitely were parts that you know shook me in my seat. But as far as being a great horror bill I would say it was good or ok but if the really inventive horror seems for not in there it would just be eh...
