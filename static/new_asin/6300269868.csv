8167269,5,6300269868,Was surprised to find a non-traditional blu-ray to be of great quality. This movie is not available to watch or dl anywhere and it is a very good movie.,1502323200,,152,4.275862068965517
8167270,1,6300269868,"Absolutely terrible transfer! Nothing said in description regarding that this DVD will only play in ""playback"" devices. Will not play in DVD drives on computers, nor though Xbox. Don't waste your money unless you have an old school DVD player. And even then, it might not work.",1454457600,,277,4.914893617021277
8167271,5,6300269868,"I saw this movie while I was 19 in the U.S. Army stationed in Hanau, Germany, with the 3rd Armored Division in 1975. I was intrigued with going to Berlin to check out Checkpoint Charlie, which was shown in this movies 2 times to get the gold bars out of East Berlin. All my army buddies at that time were barrack rats. So I did not go to Berlin while stationed in Germany between 1974 to 1977. I did go to Berlin to Checkpoint Charlie in 2013 on vacation with my wife 38 years later. This movie got Berlin with Checkpoint Charlie on my bucket list. Teddy Savalas did a great job as a stealthy con man as Major Harry Morgan.",1441584000,,623,4.1570247933884295

8167274,2,6300269868,"Print is fine, and I'm appreciative of WB for putting lesser known movies like this out on DVD.
That said, about INSIDE OUT...it's pretty bad.  The story idea is nothing new but had promise, involving a Mission: Impossible-esque substitution and lots of skulking around in divided Berlin.  In theory this means you should be better than the MI episodes that do pretty much exactly the same thing, as I'm sure the budget was higher.  Sadly INSIDE OUT cannot be considered a success.

Part of this is on the cast. Savelas never veers far from his Kojak persona (tinted glasses and everything except a lollipop), Mason puts on a silly German accent and looks a bit pained, and Guenther Meisner seems to be doing a self-parody of his Adolf Hitler roles - except INSIDE OUT might have been his first go-round with Hitler.  If it was a better movie, you'd think the self-referential plot point of hiring an ""actor"" to play Hitler was clever...this movie is not that intelligent.

Main issue is the script, though.  First there's the wasted time - we spend an awful lot of time getting to the point in a pretty talky fashion. (The repo man in the bowler hat even gets a line!)  Then, there are more plot holes and implausibilities than you can drive a truck full of gold through.  There's the infamous car jump (which might as well have been jumping the shark).  How do you get an old Nazi out of a maximum security prison?  (It doesn't involve a lot of digging through walls, luckily for them!)  How do you get several hundred pounds of gold up a few stories in the blink of an eye?  (Unclear as it's never explained.)  Yadda, yadda...

Also, in true 70's TV fashion, they throw a whole bunch of silly ""gotcha"" cliches at you - like ""you can't leave...[scary pause]...you dropped your pass.""  Or the stupid kid next to the dynamite.  Or ""we must get to the prison in less than 15 minutes, but a truck has jackknifed in a very inconvenient spot.""  Ugh.

In fact, there are dozens of Mission: Impossible episodes that pull off capers like this with more elan.  So (unless you're a James Mason or Guenther Meisner mega-fan, which would be excusable I suppose), I suggest your put your 20 bucks towards Season 2 or 3 of that series, and skip this one.

Alternatively, if you really need a good heist flick that's off the radar, get yourself a copy of SEVEN GOLDEN MEN or GRAND SLAM for half the price.",1358553600,3,2391,4.539719626168225
8167275,3,6300269868,"production left something to be desired, in my opinion.  The plot/premise/storyline, or whatever, was great;  WW2 soldiers, on both sides, go after Nazi gold years later.  That should make a great movie.  Plus, the cast of Savalas, Mason and to some extent Culp was noteworthy.  They were one of the reasons I bought this to watch, since it is rarely, if ever, on TV.

What lowered the production quality was the feel of a TV movie to it.  I know some TV productions can be good.  But it was not here.  Some of the music seemed to be out of place, not in keeping with the suspense of the story.

Also, the movie at times just seemed to be campy, almost cheesy.  Not because of the actors I mentioned, but the dialogue and direction of certain scenes.  The whole story was a suspense/thriller type and there should not have been any light-heartedness until the end of the movie when the gold was in hand.

It could have been quite a good movie.  Maybe the producer and directors of Eagle has Landed, made at roughly same time, should have run this production.  Might have ended up better.

I will try later to view this again  and see if it gets better with repeated viewing.  Some moview are like that. I would recommend waiting for a TV/cable  broadcast of this, rare as it is,  instead of purchasing the dvd.",1335398400,,1310,4.447257383966245
8167276,4,6300269868,"I really love this film, when I first seen it on TV, and was looking for in either VHS or DVD. That the film was very good interesting movie, with an all star cast. I love the music, and the story. A really Tongue & Cheek Cloak and Dagger with the East Germans, and the Russians. Nicely film in Germany, and Holland, the UK. Telly Savalas, Robert Culp, and James Mason good trio cast. And not to mention Aldo Ray.",1247097600,,413,4.175
8167277,3,6300269868,"I have watched this whenever it is shown on the televsion

 A very good cast,Very. There are not any shots filled with

 violence,flames and explosions. Just a good old fashioned

school-boys own adventure. Iwish there had been more like

this from the studios!",1140048000,6,261,4.953488372093023
