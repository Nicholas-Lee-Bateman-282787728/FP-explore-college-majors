I find it amazing that the youngest knows colors and shapes and I have to admit its mostly because of this video.  Not all videos out there are really teaching children, but I find this one, and others in the Brainy Baby series to be the exceptions.  Keep up the good work!",1043712000,6,437,3.9885057471264367
1691534,1,B000063S6K,"We just got this video, and we don't love it.  We have Brainy Baby too.  Brainy Baby is a bit clinical looking, and although
it has good intentions, it's not very creative.  This video is a little more creative, but all together not that great. My children are 1 year and 3 years.  The baby will watch it for about 5 minutes at a time before turning his attention, and my three year old is way past it the content.",1028937600,105,414,4.1375
1691535,5,B000063S6K,My son loves brainy baby. We received the right & left brain dvd as gifts and he was hooked to them. So we decided to buy a couple others and sure enough he loves them. Just long enough to hold his attention while I get a few things done and I feel good knowing he's learning from it. He screams with excitement when the babies and kids come on the screen it's adorable. Started watching them about 5 months he is now 14 months.,1419292800,,428,4.107142857142857

1691541,5,B000063S6K,"Because of the Brainy Baby DVDs my 2.5 yr old son knows his entire alphabet (upper and lower case); he can even distinguish between lower case b, d, p, etc. which all look similar.  He can count to 10 and he knows some of his shapes.  He's learning his shapes now and we will use the numbers DVD to learn 11-20.  I highly recommend Shapes and Colors, ABCs and Numbers.",1402617600,,368,4.228571428571429

1691548,5,B000063S6K,"When I first found out I was pregnant, I went shopping at my local Waldenbooks to pick up some board books. Sadly, the Waldenbooks is gone now, but I still have the books I found on that trip.

I spotted the Brainy Baby collection and knew I just had to have it for my little peanut. After all, I wanted him (or her) to have every advantage. Shapes and Colors is one of a set of four, and I'm reviewing it first, because it happens to be downstairs (thanks, Thomas), and carrying things up and down the stairs is still a challenge.

What to say about this book? Well, first it is very sturdy. This was one of the first books I let my little boy hold when he was still a baby, and it still is in near-perfect shape. As the title would indicate, it is very colorful. It does present shapes in an easy-for-a-toddler-to-understand way. Apart from calling a rectangle a square, my not-yet-three-year-old has mastered this book. And toddlers/preschoolers really seem to love it. After all, my little boy brought it downstairs for me to read with him.

The other three books in this collection are just as good, and I'll be reviewing them as they show up down the stairs.",1374710400,,1164,4.429906542056075
1691549,5,B000063S6K,This cassette is truly educational and captivates kids' attention. I play i over and over for a two year old under my care and he does not get tired of it.  He tries to repeat the name of the colors and familiarizes himself with the shapes and their name. It is a great introduction to shapes and colors for toddlers.,1370736000,,317,4.283333333333333
1691550,5,B000063S6K,"It is nice that this video tackles two concepts in one video. I like the series overall so much better than most Baby Einstein videos which many moms rave about. I highly recommended this DVD to parents/homeschoolers/caregivers/teachers who are looking for a fun, educational DVD without the gimmicky cartoons.",1365379200,,310,5.346938775510204
1691551,5,B000063S6K,Lots of shapes and colors to learn and keeps the attention of the small child.  Very good way to learn about shapes and colors.,1362182400,,127,4.291666666666667
1691552,5,B000063S6K,"For the longest time everything was ""yellow"".  I knew he would eventually figure it out but wanted to give a little encouragement.  This video is excellent.  After watching a few times he no longer says everything is yellow.  He knows all the shapes and colors and impresses people when he says oval.  Great video, its kind of long but my son watches the whole video no problem.  He still likes to watch the video which is a bonus.  Definitely recommend !",1360886400,,455,4.54320987654321
1691553,5,B000063S6K,Great educational DVD. I like that it gives pictures of everyday items that are shapes. It helps when my 22 month old sees it on the DVD and then while we are out and about in our day I can remind him of the shapes that he saw in the DVD. He really enjoys the Brainy Baby DVD's.,1360540800,,278,3.810344827586207
1691554,5,B000063S6K,"My daughter is now 3 1/2 years old. She started viewing the entire Brainy Baby Collection since the age of 2. I must say this DVD has not only aided in shape recognition, it also introduced shapes within everyday objects (e.g. Sandwich (square), pancakes (round), folded napkin (triangle), street signs (rhombus). She notices shapes of all sizes--pointing things out that I didn't even notice...like octagon shapes embeded in the marble flooring of my local bank. I highly recommended this DVD to parents/homeschoolers/caregivers/teachers who are looking for an fun, educational DVD without the gimmicky cartoons. I must add that NOTHING replaces good ol' fashion observation of shapes in our everyday lives, indoors, as well as outdoors.

P.S. This DVD covers Primary /Secondary colors, Cool/Warm colors. The visual aids shown on this DVD were brillantly simple and fun.

Cannot recomment Brainy Baby series enough. Excellent investment!",1358899200,,938,5.506944444444445
1691555,4,B000063S6K,"My kid is smart. And not like ""oh, he's a smart kid"" but like ""holy cow, you have a smart kid"" smart. I really do think these videos help. We've been watching the Left Brain and Right Brain videos for a long time, and he still likes them at 3, but is starting to get a little bored with them. So we tried this one for older kids. He thinks it's awesome. I like the Left and Right Brain videos more, because they play nice classical music and are very unoffensive to listen to while you're paying bills, or folding laundry, or whatever reason you need your baby to be entertained without you. This video's music is... not as nice. My 3 year old likes it. But he also likes Spongebob. So, there's that.

All in all, very educational. Apparently entertaining",1358380800,2,755,4.3546099290780145
1691556,3,B000063S6K,"I have the LEFT BRAIN & RIGHT BRAIN Brainy Baby DVDs and my daughter has loved them since she was 4 months old. She really watches and pays attention to them. I thought this Shapes & Colors one would be good, but it's a little too advanced for her at 9 months old. I'm hopeful that when she's old enough, she'll like it though. It's my own fault for not reading the product description prior to buying so I would have known this is more for older children.",1344211200,7,456,4.193181818181818
1691557,5,B000063S6K,"So, my 3 y o daughter loves the colors song! Such a nice sing along song. Apart from that, I love the presentation of the concepts. Introduced once and then reviewed by a child and an enthusiastic adult. I found it really good.",1323388800,,227,4.3023255813953485
1691558,1,B000063S6K,This video has a poor production quality. A video with kids hold up colors and shapes dancing around. I could have made this video with a home video recorder.,1293753600,91,158,4.482758620689655
1691559,3,B000063S6K,"It's okay. I do like how they teach the colors and shapes, although the production value could be better for the price. It doesn't have an actual storyline, but it's a decent educational video. Unlike some I've seen, it's not confusing or unclear in anyway. The use of real kids is good, too. Helps hold my son's attention. He's two and doesn't ask for this video by name, but if I put it in, he usually watches. The colors section is the best I've seen so far.",1252713600,8,461,4.310344827586207
1691560,4,B000063S6K,"previously purchased brainy baby ""music"" video for my 1 & 2 year old daughters and they love it.  decided to expand the video library with brainy baby shapes and colors and they enjoy it just as much!",1241222400,,200,4.405405405405405
1691561,5,B000063S6K,"I purchased almost all the Brainy baby DVds, that includes ""ABC"", ""123"", ""Shapes and colors"", ""animals"", ""Music"",""Art"",""English"", and before ""Pick-a-boo"" and "" Laugh and learn"". They all are wonderful and educational! My son loves them and learned his ABS, colors and shapes, and count,expanded his vocabulary tremendously!
All the videos are musical, colorful, clear ,fun to watch, easy to follow, full of information and knowledge! All the concepts in art and music are well presented, I am an art/music teacher, and could easily use those tapes at school for Pk/K level! I would recommend it to anyone!",1231804800,,605,5.247422680412371
1691562,4,B000063S6K,"I was pretty confident that my daughter would like this video based on other people's reviews, but it's definitely gone beyond my hopes.  Even for a baby who gets to watch other ""entertainment-based""  cartoons, her eyes still light up when she sees the case for this one, and will even ask for it by ""name"" (""Babeee!!"").  Highly recommended.",1228694400,,341,4.844827586206897
1691563,5,B000063S6K,"Our son is on the Autism Spectrum and is a very visual learner.  He knew his shapes and colors and we used this as a repetition source for maintenance.
One day while driving he came out with one of their songs - Green grass, blue sky, red apples and the yellow sunshine.  We were surprised since he doesn't normally speak without a lot of prompting.  He really liked the song.  We in turn were very happy to hear him sing the words out clearly.  Highly recommend for those on the ASD.",1219017600,2,484,4.274725274725275
1691564,5,B000063S6K,I was given this DVD and I love it!  I started letting my son watch it about once a week when he was around 15 months and he knew his shapes and colors in no time!  I think these videos are superior to Baby Einstien because they actually teach your child.  If you are unsure just buy a used one and try it. I doubt you will be dissapointed.,1218585600,,340,3.898550724637681
1691565,5,B000063S6K,"This was the first of the Brainy Baby series DVDs I bought for my now 3 1/2 month old son.  It hooked me.  I like the series overall so much better than most Baby Einstein videos which many moms rave about (except I do like Neptune in that series).  Anyway, this video is wonderfully perpared.  It has vibrant uses of colors and shapes--using many children and creative ideas for every day items to show children shapes--such as a pizza slice for a triangle.  Since children tend to want to watch the same video over and over--be sure to pick one you can stand too.  This one is fun to watch for you and your children.",1193443200,2,618,4.3304347826086955
1691566,3,B000063S6K,The video is Ok but some of the songs are pretty hokey and even my son doesn't like them. He will watch the video but he has yet to sit for the entire video like he does with others.,1123632000,9,182,3.6923076923076925
1691567,3,B000063S6K,"The Shapes portion of this video begins with a really long song about shapes and foods (triangles are like pizza slices, etc).  I really don't care for the singing voices.  It always sounded to me like they were singing, ""Whilst you know how to name your shapes"".  I had to listen to this over and over and finally realized they they were really singing ""Once you know how to name your shapes"" (at least I think that must be what they are saying because whilst just doesn't make sense).

The shapes focused on in this video are circle, square, triangle, rectangle, star, diamond, heart, oval, crescent, and then they have a very little bit with the shapes pentagon, hexagon, and octagon.

The very first time I watched this I thought it was annoying.  Everything seemed to be fast and hard to absorb.  As I watched it again I felt that it wasn't quite as bad as I thought at first.  I like the Colors half of the video better.

In the Colors section they have a lot of repeats of Baby's First Impressions Colors,  but Brainy Baby has more speaking and adds a few more colors.  The colors are red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple, brown, pink, black, white, silver and gold.  After a few colors they have a color review.  Just for you to get an idea, for purple they show these things in purple: balloons, flowers, bunny, ball, baby with a scuba outfit on (why?  I don't know.  I guess because it's purple),  slinky, grapes (animated ones and also real ones), egg plant, pool dolphin toy, easter egg, toy turtle and then kids in purple.

It is nice that this video tackles two concepts in one video.  I think it's ok but I'm not wildly excited about it.  I really like So Smart Shapes and So Smart Colors better.  Please read my other reviews.",1116028800,5,1746,4.465189873417722
1691568,4,B000063S6K,This is a good DVD. My daughter likes it. She likes all the shapes and colors in the Brainy Baby Video and in the Galloping Minds 'Shapes and Colors' video. I recommend both.,1102032000,,174,4.303030303030303
1691569,5,B000063S6K,"We started off with ""Right Brain"" on this series. After a few days we introduced my daughter (20 months) to Shapes and Color DVD. We must admit, this is an awesome DVD. Even better than the Right Brain! The narrator describes each shapes and colors very clearly and distinctly. My daughter after watching it for few days can now say red green blue (in her own pronounciation ofcourse) ! I would highly recommend this DVD. Along with this, you may also look into getting bright colored balls and objects. We bought five very bright colored foam balls from Walmart which also proved to be very valuable. Now she can relate to things shown in the DVD and things around her. Also there is a song in the DVD ""I am sitting on green grass"" which we thought was sooo peaceful and catchy that me and my wife are always humming it. :-D",1095724800,10,825,4.434210526315789
1691570,5,B000063S6K,"The thing that I like most about this video is that it doesn't just give the 'basic' shapes, colors, etc. but is well-rounded in that it encourages the child's brain to stretch beyond the usual and it 'grows' the child everytime they watch it. They see something 'new' everytime and are always asking to watch it 'Just one more time please Mommy?' This is sweet music to my ears!",1080777600,6,379,4.507246376811594
1691571,5,B000063S6K,"I am very impressed with the Brainy Baby videos we have tried so far (Shapes & Colors; English; Animals).  My 16-mo-old is captivated by this Shapes & Colors video and I've been amazed by all the shapes she can identify (triangle, circle, square, rectangle, oval, heart, star, crescent).  I'm not saying she learned all of this from this video; she's also learning from books, puzzles and our conversations in ""everyday life.""  But what I like most about these Brainy Baby videos -- as compared to Baby Einstein -- is that they name the objects clearly as they show them.  The BE videos we have tend to show objects along with nice music (and my daughter enjoys naming the objects as she sees them), but as she is quite interested in learning names for objects right now, I like the fact that these videos name everything.  If your child likes you to read word/picture books or identify every object they see, these videos will probably be a great hit.",1077062400,27,952,4.642857142857143
1691572,5,B000063S6K,"I love Brainy Baby products--they're all awesome! My 19 month old son knows most of his shapes and colors--just today he pointed out a ""heart"" on his sippy cup and a ""circle"" on a block.
He loves to watch this video, which is his second favorite after ABC's. It's positive, well done, and even fun for me to watch with him.
My favorite is how they combine ideas--when they introduce the color blue they change the background music to be the blues. Very well done.
I HIGHLY recommend this video--this series actually (ABC, 123, Animals) to anyone.",1074297600,3,546,4.639175257731959

1691574,5,B000063S6K,"I just love this video.  My daughter is learning so much from it and it is great fun to watch together as well.  There are computer animations, happy children, lots of fun toys related to the topic.  As always with this series, the music is great.  I like that included is shapes like pentagon and hexagon.  Great lessons, never boring, just what children love!  Finally a video company that cares about high educational standards as much as I do!  (And still knows how to have fun doing it!)

This particular one is one of their favorites- the little one has learned pretty much all her shapes and colors from this DVD! The lack of crazy pigmented animation is something I like- something actually soothing for them to watch and so refreshing from the blaring Dora we usually hear! (Big Dora fans in our household!)
