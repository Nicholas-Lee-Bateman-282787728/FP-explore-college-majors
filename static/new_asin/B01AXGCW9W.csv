7613918,5,B01AXGCW9W,"I highly recommend this to any Film Noir fan, or classic movie fan in general.  I enjoy Film Noir's, and have seen a great many of them  Now having seen Too Late for Tears, restored by the FilmNoirFoundation and UCLA, and released by Flicker Alley, this has become one of my top five favorite Noirs of all time.  It is so good that I was puzzled as to why it was not more generally circulated or better known.  Then, I watched the story of the restoration, and that told the story as to why this film is really just now seeing the light of day.  In fact, without a great deal of effort in the search and rescue process, this film may have been lost forever.  The restoration work was done beautifully as the picture and sound are like new.  And the packaging from Flicker Alley is outstanding.  The artwork is great, and in fact you have the option of a reversible cover, which I took advantage of to select the cover more akin to the original poster art.  It is very rare for me to write a review of a purchase, but in this case I was impressed enough to write one.  I am also writing one for the companion Flicker Alley release of Woman on the Run.",1464307200,,1150,4.210045662100456
7613919,5,B01AXGCW9W,"It's about time this essential noir was rescued from crappy public domain purgatory. Now it can be appreciated for the gem it is. This is Lizabeth Scott's film: she's slippery, seductive and utterly shameless. I liked the stills and essays in the booklet that came with the disc and the featurettes about the film were also helpful. It's a nice set. A must for noir fans.",1464134400,,371,4.636363636363637
7613920,4,B01AXGCW9W,"TOO LATE FOR TEARS is the other title recently released by Flicker Alley (along with WOMAN ON THE RUN) as part of a collaborative effort between them, the Film Noir Foundation out of San Francisco, and the UCLA Film & Television Archive. Billed as the ""Return of the Film Noir Classic"" it restores a really good example of the genre to viewers once again. TEARS is just another one of several independently produced films that fell into the public domain and has existed for years in bad video copies that were taken from a battered 16mm print. Some of those copies are still available but don't be fooled. When it comes to many older movies, you get what you pay for. This set may be high priced by regular standards but it's worth it. In addition to a DVD/Blu-Ray combo you get loads of special features on the discs and a 24 page booklet.

The story, based on a SATURDAY EVENING POST serial (and later pulp paperback with an eye popping cover) by Roy Huggins, concerns a middle class housewife (Lizabeth Scott) and her husband (Arthur Kennedy) whose lives are forever changed when a satchel full of stolen money is tossed into their car. The husband wants to notify the police but the wife has other ideas. Things get complicated in true Noir fashion when the man who tossed the satchel (Dan Duryea) shows up to get his money back. Scott is determined to keep the money at any cost which keeps mounting as the film progresses. Throw in a suspicious sister-in-law and an old military friend of the husband and things get really complicated. To say any more (as another reviewer did) would spoil the several surprises TEARS contains so I'll stop right here with this little bon mot. The ending, though a bit over-the-top, is a real corker.

Scott is fantastic as the frustrated housewife who dreams of better things and will allow nothing to stand in her way in order to achieve them. Duryea, who specialized in playing low life heels, finds himself in over his head which allows his character more depth than he usually got to play. The supporting players, Arthur Kennedy and Don DeFore (later on TV's HAZEL) are equally good and help to keep the proceedings interesting until the final payoff. What keeps me from giving the movie 5 stars is the direction of Byron Haskin. Cinematographer turned director Haskin is best remembered for such fare as THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953) and TREASURE ISLAND (1950). While good at action-adventure he has no real feel for the Noir genre (something mentioned in the special features) so that the pace sometimes lags and the lighting lacks visual flair. Nevertheless TEARS is still a very good movie that is great fun to watch so three cheers for this wonderful restoration. If you're a fan of Lizabeth Scott, Dan Duryea or Film Noir in general, than this one is irresistible.",1462665600,9,2814,4.682828282828283
7613921,4,B01AXGCW9W,"I really hate it when I see ""Lost"" attached to a film that wasn't ""Lost"". Case in point: Too Late for Tears.
Yes, it's mostly in the public domain in poor quality prints but Mueller did release it thru Image under their Dark City label in a very good dvd transfer back in 2003 (they also released a mighty fine ""Kansas City Confidential""). So this ain't Lost (more like forgotten but growing in popularity). Does it deserve a good restore? Absolutely, and I hope Flicker Alley does a great job, especially at this price. But it ain't ""Lost"" by a long margin.",1458000000,7,558,4.480392156862745
7613922,5,B01AXGCW9W,"1949: Lizabeth Scott and her husband are driving down a California highway in their convertible.
A car drives up beside them and someone throws a suitcase into their back seat, then takes off.
No it's not a bomb.
When they open the suitcase, it's full of money.
The husband (Arthur Kennedy) wants to report it to the police, but Lizabeth Scott has different ideas.

This is probably the most preposterous opening to a Hollywood movie ever,
but ""Too Late for Tears"" is a wonderful example of film noir.
One of the few with a female protagonist driving the plot.

Lizabeth Scott's life becomes a nightmare from this point on, but I won't provide any details.
I wouldn't want to to spoil the surprises (there are a lot of them).

It's a public domain film, which is both good and bad news.
The Good News is that ""Too Late for Tears"" has been available on low-priced DVDs for as long as there have been DVDs (Alpha Video, A2ZCDS, Synergy)
The Bad News is that those prints look TERRIBLE.

I saw ""Too Late for Tears"" on TCM in 2015.
I was surprised by how good the print looked - almost a different film.
Now it's been released in a new Blu-Ray and DVD combo.
A joint production of Flicker Alley, The Film Noir Foundation, and the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

The original negative is lost.
The painstaking restoration process, involving multiple 35mm prints, is detailed in a fascinating five minute mini-documentary.
The picture isn't perfect, but what the UCLA lab has accomplished is nothing short of heroic.

Flicker Alley includes a commentary track with film scholar Alan K. Rode,
plus two mini-documentaries (21 minutes total)
SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT WATCH THESE EXTRAS UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE VIEWED THE MOVIE,
plus a 24 page booklet. DON'T READ IT EITHER,
English SDH subtitles.
This deluxe treatment is rare for a public domain film .
A bit expensive, but it's a great movie and your money will go to a good cause.

Trivia: The original title for Roy Huggins screenplay was 'Break the Wild Wind'.
I sort of wish they had kept it.

Lizabeth Scott (born 1922) was a fixture of film noir.
Her attempts to move into different genres was hampered by her appearance.
Not that she was too beautiful, but she looked too much like another actress who had a more established career:
Lauren Bacall (born 1924)

7613923,5,B01AXGCW9W,"I asked for this film to be released on blu-ray in our TCM noir class.  I guess maybe someone listened.  Lots of us voted this as one of our favorites.  Hope the price comes down a bit and hope the print quality is good.  I guess a 5 is a bit premature without seeing the quality, but just so happy it will be released on blu-ray.",1453680000,7,330,3.9545454545454546
7613924,5,B01AXGCW9W,Wow.  I always enjoy seeing Lizabeth Scott in any movie so I am probably a little biased.  But she is great in this one as the wife who starts out (mostly) mild and progresses to .... well you have to see it.  Good restoration on the Blu-Ray with some short documentaries on the movie and the restoration.,1476230400,4,305,4.315789473684211
7613925,5,B01AXGCW9W,"Made in 1949 this is one of those films that is a must for all noir fans. Do be warned though as this fell out of copyright some years ago and was widely duplicated  often very badly  but this is the restored version and is an absolute gem.

Late one night a couple are driving to a party that is far from inviting when a slow car tosses a bag into their open top car. The bag is choc full f cash. The wife is Jane Palmer (Lizabeth Scott) and she decides that she is going to hang onto the cash  despite what her husband wants. So she decides to convince him to keep it. He is cut from a different cloth and it soon becomes apparent how far she will go to keep it.

Now Lizabeth Scott is a show stealer here and that is even though everyone else is great too. She is so convincing as the manipulative and self centred vixen and I just loved it. As I said earlier watch out for poor copies or better still get the restored version. For those of you that love fashion, there are some timeless and elegant gowns on display here too and the men all wear zoot suits so you cant win em all. This is a must for all fans of the genre and one that has aged with style.",1475539200,,1159,3.9570815450643777
7613926,5,B01AXGCW9W,"Too Late for Tears, 1949 film

This was based on a `Saturday Evening Post' serial. It begins with a view from a hill overlooking a city in the dark (Los Angeles). A car drives along the highway, the couple in it argues. Another car tosses a satchel into their car. Then they are chased by another car. Is a bag of money good luck or a curse? Will they hide it or turn it in to the police? Will Jane spend some? Then a detective shows up to search their apartment. There is a surprise here! Does Jan have a character flaw? Can money buy ""peace of mind""? Danny shows up again for his cash. Will Jane make a deal? Will she play fair? Was that a mistake? ""You're quite a gal."" Will their plot be successful? Jane takes Danny for a ride, but he jumps out and runs away.

Alan's sister checks their apartment and finds the claim ticket. An old war buddy of Alan's shows up. Katherine talks to him. What happened to Alan? Would he take his Army gun with him? Lt. Breech from Homicide shows up. Was there another woman? Alan's car was found near the Mexican border. Jane is curious about Don Blake. Is Katherine a threat to Jane? Danny doesn't like this, but he has no choice. Don and Katherine investigate Alan's disappearance. ""That explains everything."" Finally there is a meeting that causes a crisis for Don Blake. Jane goes to recover the satchel and keeps her bargain. ""Its all ours."" Danny tells how he got the money - blackmail!

Jane has one more trick up her sleeve. The police find Danny but he won't talk. We learn that dragging a lake has a lot of paperwork. Jane leaves California for Mexico. Don Blake shows up, we learn more about him. He is a killjoy. At the end we learn who Don Blake really is. Jane refuses to come quietly and so she is not taken back to America.

The unexpected plot twists will keep you surprised. This story reminds me of ""Double Indemnity"". ""Jane Petrie"" is the most vicious villainess since ""Phyllis Nirdlinger"". One flaw in this story is that Jane did not see a family resemblance in Don Blanchard. Jane's first husband was Bob Blanchard.",1474070400,,2074,4.407310704960835

7613928,5,B01AXGCW9W,"This is an essential film noir that hasn't been available in a restored state before on DVD, much less BluRay.

7613930,5,B01AXGCW9W,"When it comes to exploring the darker side of human nature, film noir stands as the most potent genre to do just that. But what's most remarkable about it, it accomplishes this by incorporating ingenious methods of getting around a restrictive Production Code that went against the very types of subject matter these films indulged in. Logically, the genre shouldn't have succeeded as well as it did, nor endured as long as it has under such restraining circumstances. And while many noirs have been regarded as great films for decades, others have only recently come to be fully appreciated. A case in point is a nifty number called TOO LATE FOR TEARS (Republic, 1949).

What would you do if you happened to be driving along and someone speeds by tossing a satchel containing $60,000.00 onto the back seat of your car? TOO LATE FOR TEARS shows us one woman's answer to that question - she'd be willing to commit murder to keep the cash. Of course, just how she goes about devising her plan is what generates the nail biting suspense in Roy Huggins' screenplay adapted from his ""Saturday Evening Post"" serial. With taut, no-nonsense direction by Byron Haskin, the film spares no punches (nor noirish punch lines) in pulling off an unlikely premise as well as offering us a few twists before the disarming climax.

Heading the superb cast are sexy, smoky voiced Lizabeth Scott as the discontented, sociopathic housewife, and slap-happy screen tough Dan Duryea as her reluctant accomplice. Both are driven to each other not out of love or lust, but by their mutual and, in Scott's case at least, all-consuming desire to possess the money. Simply put, this film is about greed and the path of self-destruction it inevitably leads to. Scott and Duryea are likely giving their finest performances here, playing off each other brilliantly with a lethal chemistry that rivals Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in DOUBLE INDEMNITY (Paramount, 1944). They're more than ably supported by Arthur Kennedy as Scott's hapless husband, Don Defore as a mystery figure who seems to know more than he should, Katherine Miller as Scott's suspecting sister-in-law and Barry Kelley as a cop who draws his own conclusions.

TOO LATE FOR TEARS has been underrated since its release partly because of its poor box-office returns and the fact that both writer Huggins and director Haskin were dissatisfied with the end result. Another factor is that the film was allowed to lapse into public domain, which led to inferior prints being the only means by which one could see it. Thankfully, this neglect has finally been rectified with Flicker Alley's extensive, exhaustive restoration of TOO LATE FOR TEARS which is available as a Blu-ray/DVD combo edition. Now, audiences can come to appreciate what a marvelous film it is and how well it encapsulates all the typical film noir staples, but in unusually perverse ways.

Bonus features include an absorbing audio commentary by noir historian Alan K. Rode, a mini-documentary on the making of TOO LATE FOR TEARS, a piece on the efforts made to rescue this ""lost"" noir classic and a 24-page, well illustrated souvenir booklet.

The lesson learned here is it's never too late to rediscover a terrific classic movie.

My highest recommendation.",1466380800,4,3266,4.994485294117647
7613931,5,B01AXGCW9W,"Ever since watching the restoration of TOO LATE FOR TEARS at the UCLA Festival of Preservation in 2015, I had been eagerly awaiting the DVD (and Blu-Ray combo, in this case) release. I must say, when I finally got hold of this set, I was very pleasantly surprised.

The movie, which for years had been only available in sub-par versions after it fell into the public domain, was transferred from the 35mm restoration, and it is definitely not the only highlight here, though the picture quality is superb and the film as a whole is highly entertaining. Stars Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea portrayed two of THE most quintessential noir characters, and both performances register around each actor's best, in my opinion. I've always particularly adored the abundance of suggestive, biting dialogue (Danny: ""Don't ever change, Tiger. I don't think I'd like you with a heart"") and Scott's ability to vacillate between seductive, smoldering and outright dangerous, even when she's trying to play innocent.

Presentation-wise, this set reminded me of the good ol' days of DVD, when packaging, extras, and even those insert booklets (or a mere one sheet) existed. Nowadays, you usually just get the bare bones - a disc - but not with this package. In addition to both the DVD and Blu-Ray, there's a beautiful 24 page booklet, which includes stills, posters, lobby cards and a very informative essay by Brian Light. I particularly enjoyed the piece, because it provided information I wasn't aware of, such as the fact that the movie was based on a book, and Jane's character had much more deeply rooted discontent in the source material (which has always been an issue with me in the film, because there's barely any basis for her evolution from disenchanted housewife to full-on murderer).

The extras were also great supplements. Though I'm generally not a huge fan of commentary tracks (and if I do listen to them, I will have it on in the background), I had the chance to listen to a bit of this one, and Alan K. Rode's comments were both sharp and entertaining; I've heard him speak before several times, and I think an audio commentary track is an ideal format for him to share observations and insight, because there's so much more time. I also enjoyed the short piece on restoring the film, since I'm quite interested in film restoration. The only featurette I was a little disappointed by was ""Chance Of A Lifetime: The Making of Too Late For Tears"", the reason being the speakers basically only discussed the actors and analyzed parts/performances in the movie; though the information was great (I particularly liked how Eddie Muller called parts of the picture a 'farce,' which I hadn't thought about before AND they had audio from Lizabeth Scott's 2010 Academy conversation), I was simply under the impression it would be more about the actual production, but it really wasn't; however, Brian Light went into some of those details in his essay in the booklet, for anyone who may be interested in learning more about the actual production. Perhaps another title for the short doc would have been more suitable - the content was still top notch, though.

All in all, Flicker Alley, UCLA and the Film Noir Foundation did a fantastic job in bringing back this ""lost"" classic and presenting it with all the bells and whistles it deserves. I highly recommend it to any fan of film noir!",1465948800,2,3384,4.849480968858131
7613932,5,B01AXGCW9W,"Thanks you UCLAfor restoring this amazing noir and releasing it on blu-ray.  I almost didn't buy this vlc-ray because of the ost. But, boy I am so glad I did!  I have been watching noir for the past 44 years or more, and I had never heard of this film.  The plotting is incredibly complex and original.  Lizbeth Scott is wonderful.  This a classic.  Its production values are on a par with Detour.  But the film is a miracle.  Dom De Luis is makes for some unprecedented, in my experience, of hilarious self-consiousnes at points.  He asks the other main woman if her name is Lizbeth.  Nothing formally complex here.  It's transcendental only because it limits itself to the most basic kinds of shots.

7613933,2,B01AXGCW9W,"First Off let me say that I'm a huge Lizabeth Scott fan. That said I didn't care for this flick.  I think she plays the sweet vulnerable type best.
I liked her best in  ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" a great Noir/Melodrama hybrid. If only they had gotten rid of that sappy violin etc.
Liz was also great in ""I walk alone"" & ""Pitfall""  I've got over 100 Noirs in my collection & seen about 200 & ""Too Late"" just didn't do it for me.
I tried to watch it twice & both times I ended up shutting it off after awhile . Here Liz plays the fem fatale & it wasn't working. I thought The writing/pacing and whole affair just wasn't working.  All that said I think it's great that Eddie Muller & UCLA are restoring old Noirs & hope they
keep putting them out.  With luck they or Criterion will get a hold of ""Detour"", DOA, ""Moonrise"", ""I walk alone"" & others.  Too bad they won't conflict with

The picture is so grainy that it reminds me of TV stations we used to receive on a UHF antenna---snowy. So what's with all of the five-star reviews that say ""great restoration"" or ""excellent"" or ""magnificent""? And why do too many of them use the exact same heading of ""Five Stars""? There's just too much similarity between reviews here for them to be legitimate.

The telltale fact is that the transfer is really not very good for a Blu-ray---far from it. Maybe it's better than any of the previous DVD transfers, as other reviewers have noted, but I'm not rating a comparison here. I'm very disappointed.",1531785600,,705,4.778688524590164
