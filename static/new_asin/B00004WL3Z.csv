8000679,2,B00004WL3Z,my thing is on some of theses movies out why do we make them this is one of them bad all around not good for nothing lol,1389744000,,120,3.4814814814814814
8000680,5,B00004WL3Z,"This is a spoof film and very well done. Witty script, some of the acting is very good and some is deliciously bad. But as it is a spoof this is just right. A favorite of mine and of almost everyone I showed it to.",1199923200,7,214,3.7777777777777777
8000681,1,B00004WL3Z,"I bought this video with the intention that, while KNOWING it would be bad, I'd find some glimmer of camp value in the cheesey storyline or dialogue.  There is not.  How this version of a script could be made without someone walking in and yelling ""Stop, let's cut our losses"" is beyond me. Imagine 90 something minutes of porn acting and porn plot with no porn... And done poorly! (And that might even make some of you think, I LOVE bad movies, I want to watch it... ) It's not even BAD in any funny sense of the word.  It's just ""wrong.""  Rent it if you must. Do NOT buy it because you will not watch it through.",1170115200,2,614,4.177966101694915
8000682,1,B00004WL3Z,The worst movie with even worse acting that I have ever seen. Not worth 1 star or wasting the actual plastic of the CD box.,1159315200,2,123,3.96
8000683,1,B00004WL3Z,"Yes, a support group for all those who have suffered through this ""movie""! It is indeed the worst movie I've ever seen, however it's so bad it's hysterically funny. This poor film has a huge identity crisis going on, is it soft porn, drama, comedy, or what? Example; towards the end of  Cellblock, there is a tense fight scene which takes place in the cell. One of the charecters, (I won't mention who and spoil the fun!), reaches over and grabs a milk CARTON, cracks it against a table and comes at the other with those jagged edges! I think once a year, everyone who has seen this should get together, watch the movie, and then have a great Cellblock Q party afterwards to celebrate the movie ending!",1153612800,4,702,4.484375
8000684,1,B00004WL3Z,"It is just unbelievable how bad this film is.  The actors are somewhat cute, but the acting is just horrible.  The average porn film has better acting than this.  The script and storyline seem totally like the lead-in to a hot porno ... scene, but nothing happens.  Not worth owning at all unless you want to see what may be the worst ... movie ever made.",1025568000,15,355,4.333333333333333
8000685,1,B00004WL3Z,"I rented, rather than purchased this movie, and boy am I glad. (Although if there was a way to get my rental money back I would.)
The concept had the potential to be an all-gay sendup of the the women in prison films - except it looks more like the transition scenes in a gay porno with all the sex cut out. Bad lighting. Bad acting. Bad sets. Bad writing. (You get the picture.) Even the actors look embarassed to be in this one.
Oddly, on the DVD, this is also a photo gallery option - that has almost nothing to do with this film. Out of 75 or so shots, only a half dozen come from the film - the rest are gratuitous shots of naked men - apparently from other vidoes (most likely porn) the company owns.
The movie: a painful 82 minutes. The DVD: a waste of plastic. Move along to something better - you'll thank me for it.",979516800,24,825,4.098765432098766
