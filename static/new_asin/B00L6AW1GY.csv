6473025,3,B00L6AW1GY,"""Killer Mermaid"" starts off promisingly enuf!... A young couple are making out on the Adriatic sea shore - the girl takes off her top and goes into the clinch with her BF - BUT - suddenly HE is lured into and under the water by a mysterious haunting melody and the shocked girl is simultaneously dispatched by an, unseen, on-shore psycho killer. This duel threat scenario of land-based AND water-based killer(s) is an interesting concept and sets the stage for all the subsequent action - wherein the usual group of young people with a variety of socio/sexual entanglements get picked off one by one as the plot progresses. At the same time this is indicative of the, sort of, schizoid approach that this film demonstrates, as it moves forward, that I found tended to detract from its' potential success.  Is it a slasher flik OR is it a killer mermaid flik?!?

While there WERE a few original concepts & creepy moments - much of the movie seemed derivative & pretty 'by the numbers'.  For starters - it was hard not to make comparisons with Spielberg's JAWS as 'Killer Mermaid' utilized so many of its' sorta 'over-used' techniques in attempting to provide thrills & chills... such as: the numerous underwater scenes with pulsating music alluding to the unseen aquatic threat - the grizzled old 'Quint'-like mariner who spins a long-winded scary tale of doom, and the key characters who ultimately end up in a vulnerable little boat on the sea anticipating an attack from the deep! Personally, I found it a little disappointing that so much time was devoted to the land based murderer - I was expecting and hoping for more mermaid action!

On the 'plus' side:  the cast was attractive (lotsa skimpy bikinis!) and the dialog, albeit banal, was delivered adequately - though there was a LOT of verbal exposition that sorta slowed things down on several occasions.  The 'mermaid' was pretty effectively realized AND had an unusual feature... a remarkably nice butt! - not the 'classic' asexual fishy lower extremities one typically sees in mer-creatures - this one has an attractive pink 'booty' B4 the tail begins! She was pretty gorgeous... when she wanted to be.  It was also nice to see x-ploitation alumnus Franco Nero resurrected to fulfill the role of 'Nikos' - the sage old salt who tries to warn the young folk away from danger. The locations were interesting and definitely added to the 'sinister' feel of the film.

On the 'negative' side of the equation, however, I would again note the formulaic nature of many of the plot devices and the manner in which the story is told - not many surprises here! There are some fairly massive incongruities in the action and the, previously mentioned, tendency to try to 'explain' things in long winded soliloquy that generally slackened the pace and tension of the proceedings.  Also - for fans of such - there ultimately was very little 'skin' on display beyond the brief opening sequence - Heck! even the 'topless' mermaid hardly revealed her upper torso to much advantage... apparently relying more on her 'siren song' to lure the men into her deadly embrace.

Over-all I found this eastern-European stab at horror to be OK - but with a little more originality and imagination it coulda been so much more... a bit more screen time for the titular mermaid wouldn't have hurt either.  Perhaps more of a 'renter' than 'a keeper'- in my opinion - BUT worth a look!  Widescreen format - English language - some nice extras.",1411603200,2,3470,4.81344537815126
6473026,3,B00L6AW1GY,"Listen, the movie is called ""Killer Mermaid."" So if you are mulling renting this movie, your expectations can't be high, right? I mean, when you stumble across a movie with ""Killer"" in the title (Killer Clowns, Killer Jellyfish, Killer Peanut butter - you get the point) you're really looking for some good B movie fun. And on that level, the movie almost delivers.

Kelly and Lucy go to the Mediterranean to meet an old college friend, enjoy the sites, and for Kelly to write an article. While on a boating excursion, they (along with three other friends) decide to visit a mysterious island. An old man warns them not to go - there is wisdom in age - but as we have come to expect in these movies, they ignore him and promptly go visit. And that's where all hell breaks loose.

There's a killer and there's a mermaid. And there's a killer mermaid.

I found it odd that Kelly would take a cruise ship, a yacht, and a small boat into the Mediterranean when she is petrified of the water. And I was a little disappointed in the inner fiber of our heroine.

Slight spoiler:

In most horror conventions, there is some point where the heroine overcomes her fear and does what needs to be done to save herself and her friends. I waited for Kelly to do that. And I waited some more. And then I waited again.

Let's just say that Kelly is NOT ride-or-die. She's mostly run and hope somebody will save her.

The best line comes toward the end of the movie, when the old ship captain says something like, 'the mermaid's sisters are coming and they will kill us all.' He means this sincerely and he's fully committed to dying in battle.

But uh ... mermaids can't walk. They can't drive. Can they really get beyond the pier? I mean, really, there isn't much they can do outside the water. They aren't the biggest threat - not like a vampire or something. So I wasn't quite sure HOW the mermaids were going to kill them all. But he was convinced, and in these types of movies, that's all you need.

So caution to you, beware the water, beware the killer mermaids. Because they are out to kill us all.",1411516800,3,2089,4.405194805194805

6473031,3,B00L6AW1GY,"Computer graphics bring an ancient Greek myth to life in this mostly well-done horror flick about a mermaid monster. Two American girls go on an exotic vacation and meet up with an old college boyfriend and his new fiance. During a day trip on the ex-boyfriend's yacht, the group spots a mysterious island with an abandoned prison (sort of like a Mediterranean version of Alcatraz.) They join forces with an old friend of the fiance's and decide to go adventure on the island even though an old man warns them sternly to ""stay away"" from the place. (Who listens to old men in cafes anyway?) The suspense builds quickly after they run into someone unexpected on the island.
Parts of this movie were absolutely excellent. There aren't many places creepier than an abandoned prison at night when your flashlight is burning out. Sometimes the acting could've been a little more convincing. The tension was quite high in some places, but I was freaking out more than the actors seemed to be at times. If you are a big fan of horror movies, put this one on your list. If you want absolute realism, pick something else.",1410220800,24,1112,4.678571428571429
6473032,4,B00L6AW1GY,"There are three things that make this movie a four star production.

Those being the beautiful scenery ,the excellent creature effects and Franco Nero. Otherwise it was an interesting watch with some pretty good character development and nicely paced plotline.

The main story being about a killer mermaid in itself is an intriguing subject which is built around cleverly..

During the third act things heat up and there are  explanations  that put  certain things into perspective and enlighten us as viewers.

If you're looking for a gore fest you won't find it here but there is a few kill scenes that don't pack much of a  punch save one and its done in a very darkened light. Overall its a satisfying film that lovers of folk lore or underwater creature films will enjoy.",1410220800,,776,4.7819548872180455
6473033,3,B00L6AW1GY,"This little film from Serbia directed by Milan Todorovic is based on a story by Marko Backovic and transformed into a screenplay by Barry Keating and Milan Konjevic. It will satisfy the current voracious appetite for horror stories that serve substantial amounts of gore to audiences who love that sort of thing. With an unknown cast the director relies on the presence of Franco Nero to bring a bit of credibility to an otherwise incredulous story.

Two American girls travel to Montenegro on vacation to visit an old friend, playboy Alex who unbeknownst to the girls is now engaged. They decide to venture to Mamula, a former prison island and Nazi concentration camp that houses a horrendous evil. During their exploration of the fortress they discover that they are not alone: a sinister fisherman named Niko (Franco Nero)  is seen disposing of human remains in a well and everyone realizes they are in mortal danger. Someone else is on the island with them and he will stop at nothing to protect it's secrets. There is a darkness hidden beneath the island and the terror has just begun - the killer mermaid.

As if there weren't enough of this type of tale on television for free they continue to light up the marquee. As long as there is an audience there will be more. In Serbian and English with subtitles. Grady Harp, September 14",1410048000,4,1339,4.738197424892704

6473049,4,B00L6AW1GY,"WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS: One big complaint: When the title of the film reveals the film's main twist, I have a problem with it. This film was released under the title NYMPH in most other countries, which keeps the mystery of the film intact. Now a couple of small complaints: 1): I almost didn't buy this DVD because one of the blurbs on the front cover of the DVD said ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER meets SPLASH!"" Since that blurb is attributed to genre website DreadCentral, all I can say after watching the film is the person who wrote the blurb was either drunk or stoned or he took one throw-away line in the film and thought he was being creative. He was not. The film has nothing to do with either film except for peripheral elements. And I don't remember Daryl Hannah's mermaid character eating anyone. 2): I'm also very wary when the DVD sleeve mentions that the film was an ""official selection"" at a half-dozen film festivals I never heard of before (""The Grossmann Fantastic Film & Wine Festival""? Are you kidding me?), but still didn't win one award. Don't get me wrong, this film is very entertaining, but there is hype and then there's HYPE. This is a Serbia/Montenegro co-production (How many times have you heard that? Me neither, but everyone speaks English.) that opens with a quote from Hermen Melville's ""Moby Dick"", where we see a young couple at sexual play on the beach of Rose, Montenegro (filmed on location). Sergei (Janko Cekic) is suddenly pulled under the water and his topless girlfriend Ana (Jelena Rakocevic) has a spike driven through her neck on the beach from some unknown person. Two young American female tourists, Kelly (Kristina Klebe; also an Associate Producer) and Lucy (Natalie Burn) are taking a vacation to the beautiful coastal town of Rose, where Lucy plans on meeting her college sweetheart from seven years ago, Alex (Slobodan Stefanovic), to catch up and do some partying. Lucy is somewhat disappointed to see that Alex has a girlfriend, Yasmin (Sofija Rajovic), who gives Lucy the cold shoulder. Alex has their vacation all planned out, which includes partying on a boat and doing some sight-seeing, including a deserted Army base on a nearby island that was used as a submarine dock during World War II. But first they have a pre-party at Alex's house, where Lucy sees fisherman Niko (European legend Franco Nero; REDNECK - 1973; DAY OF THE COBRA - 1980; ENTER THE NINJA - 1981) giving her the old stinkeye and Kelly jokingly says, ""I think he knows everything you did last Summer!"" (Hence the DreadCentral blurb). Kelly doesn't like the water since her sister drowned years ago (Lucy says to Alex, ""I don't think I have ever seen her in the water."") and it is quite obvious that the flame is rekindling between Lucy and Alex, since Alex noticed that Yasmin treated Lucy like a bitch a short time earlier and didn't like what he saw. We then see someone with a gaffer's hook killing a young guy on the dock. What does one thing have to do with the other? Patience, my dear readers. The next morning, Alex and the gang use his boat (it a very nice boat) to go sightseeing and take a look at the old Army base (it apparent that Kelly is nervous being on a boat), which was built when the country was known as Yugoslavia. They meet Yasmin's friend Boban (Dragan Micanovic), who Alex doesn't care for since he's a little too handy with Yasmin. Once back at shore, Boban suggests that everyone should actually go to the deserted military base tomorrow to party, but when Niko hears Boban say that, he warns everyone not to go there, since he lost six good men there a long time ago and he can still hear their screams. He also believes something evil surrounds that base and advises them, ""Just go somewhere else."" Of course, since this is a horror film, they ignore Niko's advice and take the boat there the next morning, but they cannot dock because the island is surrounded by jagged rocks, so they must swim about 20 yards to get to shore. This worries Kelly, but Boban lets her hold him tight while he swims to shore (and a little romantic heat happens between the two). Since they are on an unoccupied island, there is no cell phone service and they all see an imposing stranger (Miodrag Krstovic; billed in the credits as ""The Guardian"") dropping bloody human parts from a metal pail into a well. When The Guardian leaves, Lucy takes a photo down the well and a woman shows up on her camera phone, but The Guardian spots them and begins to fire his shotgun their way. They run to the boat, only to find it gone, so Boban tries to grab the shotgun away from The Guardian, only to get seriously cut on the leg with a knife. Boban tells everyone else to run away, while he plays a cat-and-mouse game with The Guardian. Boban avoids him and rejoins Kelly and Yasmin, but they have lost track of Lucy and Alex. Alex hears strange, beautiful singing (the women can't hear it) and he becomes obsessed with meeting the woman in the well (He is so obsessed, he tells Lucy, ""Get out of here, b***h!""). Boban and the other two girls discover a room with a bloody bathtub in the middle and the walls are plastered with newspaper articles of missing people dating back to World War II. They also find an old photo of The Guardian with Niko and they are both wearing military uniforms. Lucy joins the rest of the group and she tells them that Alex has found the mystery woman, so they go off to find him, not noticing that The Guardian has grabbed Yasmin, killed her with the gaffer's hook, put her in the bathtub and begins to decapitate her with an axe (It takes him at least ten swings with the axe to remove her head from her body, which impressed me, because it is virtually impossible to decapitate a person with a single swing of an axe, like you see in a lot of horror films. The neck contains a lot of tough muscles.). When Boban and the two American girls backtrack to find Yasmin, they see The Guardian hack off her head and throw it on the floor. Boban hears the beautiful singing and becomes obsessed in finding out where it is coming from and it takes a slap in the face by Kelly to snap him out of it. They discover that the beautiful woman they saw in the well is actually a mermaid (it comes as no surprise considering the give-away title of the film), as Boban fights for his life against The Guardian. Lucy and Kelly then spot Alex's headless body floating in the water, while the beautiful mermaid (Zorana Kostic Obradovic) transforms into a hideous creature (Mina Sablic). Lucy falls in the water and is killed by the creature, while Boban has one of his hands impaled by the gaffer's hook, but he plants the axe into The Guardian's back and kills him. Or so he thinks. The mermaid lets out a god-awful scream, which brings The Guardian back to life (she needs someone to feed her human bodies when she can't find them herself) and he chases Boban and Kelly through the bunker's labyrinth of narrow tunnels and they barely escape with their lives by making it through a metal door that leads outside. Niko is on the other side of the door and he tells them to get in his rowboat if they want to live. It turns out that Niko is the hero if this movie, as he tells the story of the killer mermaid while he rows back to the mainland. It turns out this mermaid is actually one of the ""Sirens"" of Greek mythology (Niko says the legend got one of the islands wrong, because the island that the bunker was built on is one of the three islands occupied by a Siren.). He and his men discovered the mermaid when they were building the base in the 1940's, but his six friends were murdered by the mermaid and The Guardian once use to be his friend until the mermaid took him over and made him her slave. His ex-friend than began killing tourists and residents to feed the Siren's hunger (I mean, how could you tell the authorities such an outrageous story without being thrown in a mental institution?). While Niko is just a few yards from the mainland, the mermaid attacks, knocks Boban off the boat and drags him down the water to his doom. Niko impales the mermaid with a speargun with a line attached to it while Kelly gets over her fear of the water, jumps in and tows the boat to shore. The mermaid then appears again and Kelly pulls the speargun line and drags her to shore away from the water, while Niko throws a net around her so she can't crawl back into the water. Nico nearly falls under the mermaid's spell when she starts to sing, but Kelly snaps him out of it (she should take a job where all she does is slap men in the face) and Niko stabs her to death with a multi-pronged fishing spear. The Guardian holds his dead mermaid's body in his arms, when Niko realizes that the Siren's two sisters are leaving their islands thousands of miles away to come to Rose for retribution. Nico knows that everyone in the beautiful seaside village will soon meet their doom, so he creates the first victim by impaling The Guardian's head with the gaffer's hook and then just waits for the inevitable to happen. The film ends on this ominous note, but who knows, maybe there will be a sequel?  Director Milan Todorovic, who co-directed the film ZONE OF THE DEAD (2009) with this film's co-screenwriter Milan Konjevic (Barry Keating was the other co-screenwriter and this was his very first film), based this film on the Greek mythology of The Sirens (The number of Sirens varies from story to story), which was made popular in Homer's epic story ""The Odyssey"" and they can be seen in the film THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1958), where the Sirens' yells force Sinbad's mutinous crew to crash their boats. While this film plays fast and loose with the mythology, there is plenty of topless nudity (the very first shot is of a topless woman), girls in bikinis and bloody gore to keep your eyes occupied. Besides, you get to see Franco Nero in a horror film (it's not just a cameo) and, except him and the two American actresses, nearly everyone's last names end with an ""ic"", although they all speak perfectly understandable English. The on-location photography and the real deserted Army base add immensely to the atmosphere. Nothing spectacular, but a good way to spend 96 minutes. The mermaid and creature scenes are a combination of physical and very good CGI effects, otherwise all the other gore is done physically. Partially financed by internet crowdfunding.

Killer Mermaid... Opens up with the usual hot chick getting topless or something with her man, next she gets iced... Then we're treated to a really hot chick in Natalie Burns in a bathing suit. Killer Mermaid... This spells B-movie over the top, horror comedy shlock, with plot holes so big you could coast ships through. I mean based on its name alone one should be thinking ""so bad it's good"". At least these were the things I thought coming into this with very low expectations. Fortunately, this little Serbian B-Flick is nowhere near the usual retard-fest, as the viewer is treated to a pretty well done horror movie with some really good build up and a nice revelation. More than likely I wouldn't consider this something to run out and grab, but it's definitely worth a watch at some point.

The plot follows the group of friends as they enter that forbidden island and soon make a horrific discovery. This then leads to them fighting for their lives against a man whom wants to kill them for reasons they don't know. From here the viewer is treated to a pretty good mystery and thanks to the spoiler-filled title, probably won't be able to wait until this mystery reaches its conclusion.

Director Milan Todorovic nails the character development well enough making this group people to care for. Their curiosity got the better of them with even one person wanting nothing to do with the island as he constantly made excuses not to go there. For the most part these characters were believable in their actions, all the way down to their personal feelings unrelated to the island.

The second element Todorovic handles very well is the pacing. Killer Mermaid really takes its time through some solid and creepy build up. Those whom are familiar with the mythology behind these creatures will quickly understand what's going on with their siren and its attraction towards men; and this plays a really good role in arousing interest on what's going to happen next. The addition of a human killer roaming around murdering people also adds to the suspense, but at the same time it works against the movie creating a pretty big flaw.

I do understand for the most part that not many people are fighters especially women. The first instinct is to run when facing life threatening danger and this is simply standard fare in the horror genre anyway; yet at the same time though, I simply couldn't buy into the killer as a legit threat, and I continuously wondered why he was even breathing at all. It seemed like he could be easily beaten and this ruined some of the movie's effectiveness. I also have to mention the lack of gore and creative death scenes as an issue. There really isn't anything over the top which is unfortunate, because it would have made the pay off on numerous occasions that much rewarding.

Despite lacking in gore and creative death sequences with some things left up to the imagination. Killer Mermaid is still an enjoyable watch with a really nice creature design. I could imagine men trying to sleep with that thing without being hypnotized. Plus the movie continues its tense build up until the very end with a promise of something really cool.

Killer Mermaid is a movie that's better than what it should be, but it could have been much better. I do not recommend this movie at all to the gorehounds because you guys will no doubt hate it. This movie is mainly for those whom for some odd reason watch horror movies, yet complain that they are violent with blood and gore.

Pros: Works very well with its characters and build up

Cons: Lack of gore and creative kills helps hold it back",1432339200,,4045,4.6461538461538465

6473101,5,B00L6AW1GY,"I caught this little gem on netflix. Its a Serbian movie that was shot on location. I thought that it would be a waste of an hour and a half. The first thing that I noticed was how good the cinematography was. The acting was pretty good for a cast of unknown American and Serbian actors. This one has it all, bad guys, nazi's, babes in distress, murder and a cabalistic mermaid.",1423612800,2,378,4.263888888888889
6473102,4,B00L6AW1GY,"Killer Mermaid tries to pair a slasher flick with a creature feature.  It isn't quite successful in this endeavor but it was an interesting attempt.  The plot is standard for this type of film, strand a group of people somewhere they can't easily leave (in this case, a supposedly deserted island.  The villain wrecks their boat and tracks them down one at a time).  The main problem with this movie is one of intent, delivering a film that's supposed to satisfy viewers who love these types of film.  Unfortunately, the pacing is off.  The film starts with a man disappearing into the sea while his girlfriend in killed onshore.  After that barely promising sequence, the film and story lags as we are introduced to the bodies (I meant characters).  They are not particularly interesting people yet we're made to watch them flirt and dance with only one other brief foray into horror before the story finally gets started with the group heading for the island.  The island in question was once a German installation.  Now it's an abattoir, where an ex-German soldier feeds his mermaid.  Only men are susceptible to her siren call.  This part of the movie stays close to type (where the characters are hunted, running through tunnels, losing one's head in the melee).  The mermaid was played by two women, one a fashion model, the other a swimmer.  The CGI is fairly decent.  I liked the novelty aspect of trying to merge two types of films and creating a hybrid.  If they had worked more on continuity and suspense.........  At any rate, it is what it is and it leaves you with the suggestion of a sequel.
I'm keeping it for future viewings.",1423526400,,1642,4.685314685314685
6473103,3,B00L6AW1GY,"Wow, I was quite under impressed.  This is  beautiful shot scenery and location for this film.  All the actors do a good fun job, especially Franco Nero.  But it painfully drags I guess forward towards the main event.  Pretty good CG for the mermaid but takes much to long to get to this creature.  3 stars is being kind only because the pieces were better that the picture as a whole.  For an afternoon TV type free  movie and time killer it's Okay, but it is not campy like the Sharknado movie franchise.",1423180800,,506,4.365591397849462
6473104,2,B00L6AW1GY,"I'm so bored that I came to Amazon so I could write this review. I've never written one in real time maybe it'll make it more interesting. I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum but make no guarantees. You have been warned.

I'm not quite half way through and I'm still just wondering if we're ever going to get to the point.

The characters all have some kind of personal drama but nothing that's actually interesting enough to keep me focused on the story or cheering for their survival. What? A character is afraid of water which we'll be encountering a lot of soon? Didn't see that coming!

The actors are just dull, they speak mostly in monotone and there is a lot of uncomfortable eye contact with the camera.

Lamest fight for a weapon, ever, my chihuahuas are more aggressive when playing tug of war.

And now we're back to slow.

Wow finally a mermaid. I do like some elements of the character design but overall not impressed. Although I'd like to know what eye makeup she uses, she's got it on pretty thick and its not even smudged.

Geez 16 minutes left in the movie and we're just now getting to the backstory.

There are unanswered questions that only a lesbian's presence in the film could answer. Oh well.

Is that really the time to bring this up?random switching back and forth of gears.

That's it? That's how it ends? Lame. Just lame.

Overall, this film was underwhelming. It lost my full attention very early on and never got it back. I can't name 3 characters in that film with any kind of confidence.

If you have Netflix the film is currently on there so you can watch it. Hopefully you will enjoy it more than I did.",1423094400,,1642,4.4186046511627906

6473106,4,B00L6AW1GY,"Campy fun that soars well above the Syfy-class formula stuff usually released. The movie is very entertaining and belies its low budget constraints. The title is a disappointment but the original one Nymph was a much better choice. The actress who plays the mermaid is stunningly beautiful and gives a good performance without speech. Franco Nero still has a great screen presence. Overall It is a good story that was well done. While there is always room for improvement on any project, my gripe is in the lack of vibrant color for the siren's CG body.",1421712000,,553,4.770833333333333
6473107,4,B00L6AW1GY,"A film which has a lurid title, Director Milan Todovic's 'KILLER MERMAID' aka 'NYMPH'-2014 doesn't quite deliver the goods till it reaches 45 minutes into its 95 minute running time.  Before we meet the titled creature, we are treated to a rather slow moving travelogue of Croatian landscapes with scantily clad women never building up to character and plot development until veteran Euro actor Franco Nero arrives on the scene.  Tourists are disappearing at a rapid rate suggesting a serial killer on the loose but its just a fisherman who is under the influence of our mermaid to supply her with human flesh.  Our quartet of characters led by actress Kristina Klebe who outshines the rest of the cast must struggle to survive on an isolated hard to get to atoll as Nero tries to get them back to the mainland.  The special effects of the creature played by fetching Euro model Mina Sablic are quite good and save the film from being a routine Horror outing.  Director Todovic does what he can with the budget that he had giving the audience some suspenseful scenes but because of the slow beginning, its like watching two different films.  Franco Nero looks great for his age bringing a seriousness and touch of class to the proceedings.  The film looks beautiful in a slightly letterboxed 1.85 crisp transfer in English.  The extras include a making of and behind the scenes featurette with good interviews with the cast and crew and a bonus crowd funding promotion for the film at the time of its release.  Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, the film suffers from that long stretch at the beginning which keeps it from the cult status it deserves.",1421625600,,1653,4.711805555555555

6473114,3,B00L6AW1GY,"Although suffering from a slow pace and over-exposition, this was a promising little micro-budget movie by a filmmaker early in his career.  After seeing this man-eating water nymph story, I look forward to what he can do when paired with better writers and a meatier budget.

Opening, in all straight-faced seriousness, with a soulful Moby Dick quote only to transition into a cute couple's vacation montage scored by promiscuously-themed club music and by the fourth minute baring breasts upon usthis movie is clearly all about balancing mood.  Maybe more about balancing one ominous introductory quote with lots of bikinis, butt-angled camera shots and mermaid breasts to come.

Kelly (Kristina Klebe; Breadcrumbs, Chillerama, Halloween) and Lucy (Natalie Burn; In the Name of the King 2, The Expendables 3) go on a Mediterranean adventure vacation to a small, uninhabited island with Lucy's Serbian ex-boyfriend Alex, who is bringing his fianceawkwaaaaaard.  Needless to say, some lovelines get crossed.  Also needless to say, this is hardly pertinent to the story.

Our young attractive group of vacationers encounter a super creepy old man (Franco Nero; The Woods, Django Unchained) who tries to warn them away from the island they wish to visit (Mamula) and of the man-eating nymph Scylla, who evidently ""ate"" this old man's entire diving crew.  I wonder why they didn't buy into his totally credible story about an aquatic chick eating six grown men.  So they go despite these warnings.

After he opening scenes and meeting the characters, things move at a sluggish pace and the acting is nothing to brag about.  The good thing about that is that we more than sufficiently get to know the characters and maybe even care about some of them.  The bad part is that we came to see a movie called ""killer mermaid"" and an hour into the movie we still haven't seen this flesh-gnawing fish girl!

Nothing like The Little Mermaid's Ariel, our ""monster"" in this movie is a mix of Greek mythology's singing siren and an anthropophagous mermaid.  But to compliment this we also get a psychopathic fisherman pick-axing people with a grappling hook. When we eventually see the mermaid with her latex suit and CGI-tail it is, in fact, satisfying.  I just wish we got to see a lot more of her throughout the movie.  And no, I'm not talking about mermaid boobsbut they're there as well.

The gore in this fantasy-horror is hardly present, minimal and infrequent.  A bucket of chum made of severed hands, an impaled neck (but we don't see it happen), some corpse butchering (but we don't see it happen), and a single satisfying axe to the back make up everything leading up to the equally ungory finale.  No good mermaid-related kills though.  And that just ain't right!

Directed by Milan Todorovic, who is credited as the creator of the ""first Serbian zombie movie"" (Zone of the Dead) and now the ""first"" Serbian sea creature movie.  I'm not so sure that these ""firsts"" should be considered noteworthy, but this movie wasn't awful.  It was really only ""bad"" in ""good"" ways and it certainly showed us what Todorovic can envision and do with a tiny budget.  The storytelling suffers from over-exposition, especially in the very end, but this is fixable with experience and is nothing I'd advise skipping the movie over.

Give this flick a chance.",1418342400,10,3336,4.946140035906643

Bad acting, sub par special effects, really bad writing make for yet another failed attempt at a horror movie. The writing was really the worst thing here as it was almost trying to be poetic but the film is so stupid that it makes for more of a laugh than a scare. I think this writer thought he was writing a Shakespearean play. This was ridiculous to say the least. In fact the only redeeming equity to this movie is the location and scenery.
