8736748,3,B016LFJJLI,"BOTTOM LINE: A kind of obscure movie, it is nonetheless overshadowed by other much better films in the same vein. I wanted & expected to like it a lot more but it blows through its set-ups so quickly that there's no time to get emotionally involved with the four & two legged characters, or their plight. Being an MOD release it's on the pricey side, too. Therefore, THE SILENT CALL is only very marginally recommended, for curious collectors and hardcore animal lovers. 3 STARS

THE STORY: Father packs up his wife & mop-topped son to relocate from Vegas to L.A. for better job. Their little car, (a Renault Dauphine, a tiny, woefully under-powered Karmann Ghia wannabe), is stuffed to bursting with their belongings so there isn't enough room for Pete, the big family mutt. He is supposed to stay with a curmudgeonly next door neighbor until dad can raise enough money to send for him. Pete however has other ideas. Seconds after the family leaves he makes a break for it and spends the rest of the film's scant 66 minute runtime chasing after them.

THOUGHTS: Hitting screens just a couple of years before the classic HOMEWARD BOUND, this particular film does what it can but is severely hampered by its tiny budget and too-short length, which doesn't allow for much plot or character development. Still, if you're curious to see another take on the time-honored ""pet will stop at nothing to be reunited with his/her beloved family"" genre, then by all means give this harmless, by-the-numbers entry a looksee. But in all honesty there are much better versions of this kind of tale out there, including the aforementioned HOMEWARD BOUND, (the original, not the silly remake with Hollywood 'name' actors voicing the pets. Ugh). While THE SILENT CALL purports to be a true story, there's no way of knowing just how much of it was real and how much was concocted by the scriptwriters, since obviously everything that happened between the time Pete escapes until his owners encounter him again is guesswork. Unless of course the actual story became a popular news item at the time and the affected parties, (hobos, truckers, farm owners, etc.), stepped forward to fill in details of Pete's journey by recounting their particular run-ins with the big lovable dog. Otherwise it's all speculation. We'll probably never know. Also, the film never develops any suspense or danger for our canine hero, so the drama is never as intense as it could (and should) be. Almost every step of his voyage & encounters with strangers is accompanied by silly, light-hearted music. As such, good old Pete never seems to ever be in any real danger at any time. Without much tension or dramatic build-up, the intensity of the emotional payoff when Pete is finally reunited with his young owner is also diminished. Speaking of which, that scene is over with so quickly it also hampers the film. It's like the director & film crew where desperate to finish shooting the film as quickly as possible in order to get home to dinner or something. A lot of wasted potential. Not a deal breaker, but quite disappointing.

THE DVD: This MOD (manufactured-on-demand) offering from Fox is a barebones deal. No nothing, except the film itself. On the plus side, the movie looks & sounds really good and is in its proper scope format.",1451347200,2,3299,4.8250883392226145
8736749,4,B016LFJJLI,"A very enjoyable family film. It is a throw back to the boy loves dog, boy loses dog of the Lassie era.
It is also an opportunity to see Gail Russell in her final film appearance. That brings a sadness to the proceedings
that might not be there with another actress.
I recall it when Fox released in Cinemascope/Black and White in 1961. It was a product of their ""B"" unit and
a small budget is an understatement.
But relax and watch a movie that will entertain and warm the frosty evenings.",1449360000,4,490,4.336956521739131
