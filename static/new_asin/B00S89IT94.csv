8697621,4,B00S89IT94,"Ce film, galement en ""zone 1"" est illisible sur mon graveur (mais pas sur mon PC. J'ai pu le lire et, hlas, le rendre ! Il vaut plus par son scnario que par sa ralisation, plutt statique et paresseuse. On y retrouve d'excellents acteurs, souvent partenaires : Forrest Tucker, beau et rude, visage nergique, joue ici ce  ""flingue tranquille"", sheriff dcid mais calme. Il aurait pu faire une carrire dans le registre de Wayne (dont il fut plusieurs fois partenaire). Mais il joua souvent les salauds, avec talent.  Jim Davis, le ""John Wayne du pauvre"" (selon lui-mme), tourna plus de westerns que le ""Duke"" avant de connatre une gloire tardive en patriarche de ""Dallas"". Ds le pr-gnrique, Lee Van Cleef a un traitement de star : ternel tueur en noir, il est prt  supplanter son employeur. Les femmes sont bien mais ""dcoratives"". Le climat de racisme et l'abandon du sheriff voquent ""Le train sifflera trois fois"", un homme seul face  une foule hostile et  deux salopards qui tirent les ficelles ...",1447632000,,996,4.8011695906432745

8697625,5,B00S89IT94,Great Blu-ray transfer of this little know western. Good story with some nice twists. Love the opening when the incomparable Lee Van Cleef rides into town - up to no good.,1429574400,4,171,4.548387096774194
8697626,4,B00S89IT94,"OLIVE DVD seem to be leading the field in lesser known film releases, all top quality transfers. This is no exception. A fine Scope transfer 2.35:1 ratio. Mint B/W picture and good sound. No extras. Tucker is definitely the star of this grim saga as the hardpressed sherrif trying to defend his friend Jim Davis from charges of ""immorality"" (honest). I asked myself if, in 1957 when I was 12 years old, what would I have thought of this western. Probably not a lot, as it is dialogue driven, grim, with rape, lynching and some pretty nasty stuff from Van Cleef. But watching it today I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, script and direction from Claxton. I don't feel able to quite give 5 stars or recomend it to everyone. But western fans should give it a chance. If you have never seen it it will be a worthwhile chance to take. Thankyou OLIVE.",1428969600,11,843,4.516339869281046
8697627,5,B00S89IT94,"THE QUIET GUN is a neat little Western that has been generally ignored or overshadowed by bigger-budgeted major oaters that came out in the later 1950s. Yet, it is well worth investigating; indeed, it may represent some of director William Claxton's best cinematic work.  Shot in stark but very crisp black and white (and the Olive print is pristine), it has the feel almost of film noir about it. Significantly, it offers veteran Western actor Forrest Tucker an opportunity to have a lead, as he mostly acted in supporting roles in his earlier ventures. In this effort, his calm, nonplussed ""hard"" style is sometimes reminiscent of late Randolph Scott. In his role as the threatened sheriff he is superb. Jim Davis, always dependable, turns in a fine job, as well. And then there is Lee Van Cleef, who was already in the process of honing his fiercely unique Western character...and last, Hank Worden, always fun to watch and hear.

The plot is tightly woven; it seems rather simple at first, but then sprouts legs and becomes more complex. The action is swift (the film only lasts 77 minutes) and satisfying. There is not a slow down at any point....Claxton keeps things moving and is able to build the suspense.

One last point: pay attention to the undertaker. He is the icing on this engrossing little Western romp. Recommended.",1428364800,10,1333,4.837719298245614
