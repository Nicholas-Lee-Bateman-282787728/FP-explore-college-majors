8530231,4,B008SC9XTG,"For those not ""married"" to the standard idea of what bellydance should be (classic or tribal styles) this is great. Lots of repetition to help you learn, and hiphop modern fusion combo ideas to make your own. Not for beginners.",1373068800,,227,4.7
8530232,3,B008SC9XTG,"a bit disappointed I have to say, not in Unmata - freakin love them.  They are an amazing Id almost say ""family"" of dancers.  I think my disappointment is simply the content, not the instruction.  The instruction was very easy to follow and were broken down well. I was expecting the tribal fusion interpretation that Amy had was more street hip hip and less belly dance.  I do however know that the Cover and information on the back doesnt really mention belly dance, its an assumption of mine because of what Unmata tends to do - integrate a unique style (Sigil style :) ) but infused with some belly dance.  Thank you for the moves - I did learn, just thought it could use more actual belly dance.",1362787200,4,700,4.4375
8530233,4,B008SC9XTG,"Not quite belly dance-y if that's what you're looking for, but a little more hip hop. This goddess dance leads you through powerful movements and choreography from the exciting and creative mind of Amy Sigil. I've been dancing for 25 years and I was sore the next day.",1355356800,3,268,4.604166666666667
8530234,5,B008SC9XTG,"I picked up this DVD at Hot Pot and of course it was challenging. The DVD is about an hour and a half long and it's all dance and conditioning without special features so you get your money's worth as a workout DVD. It should be noted that, like her last DVD this is not a straight belly dance workout (more modern or hip hop inspired) and is better for dance conditioning than specifically learning belly dance moves.

It has a vinyasa yoga inspired warmup that's mostly standing poses with no down dogs or other poses that strain your wrists. Amy goes through this warmup explaining how the sequence goes and then drills it extensively

Like in the warmup, everything in the choreography section is broken down and very well explained and drilled extensively before being showed in a quick performance. I have no doubt I'll be getting plenty of use out of this disc and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Unmata's style of dance fusion.",1354233600,5,950,4.615384615384615
