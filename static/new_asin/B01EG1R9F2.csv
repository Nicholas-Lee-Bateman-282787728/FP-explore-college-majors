7734671,5,B01EG1R9F2,absolutely loved this short horror film the director did an amazing job capturing the 70s and 80s horror movie spirit,1473206400,,117,4.9
7734672,4,B01EG1R9F2,"I was really plesantly surprised by this film. Over the last few years there have been so many of these 80s' (and 70s') ""throwback"" concept films, and honestly, very few of them ever invoke the nostalgia of those days with success. This one does. At less than an hour, the movie presents a handful of fake movie trailers and then the feature presentation. At first, i was a little skeptical of the running time, and I also wasn't sure I wanted to shell out the money for something that wasn't even a full length feature...but, having seen it, I've changed my mind. With the exception of maybe a few more minutes of character development, the film would be cluttered. It would get boring, I think. The fun would get old. Instead it presents a simplistic, but well paced story that looks fantastic and is so much fun! I was truly reminded of B movies from the time period, something like ""Flesh eater"" for example. The story might not be original, but it is perfectly matched with the concept, and I enjoyed it very much. The acting was surprisingly decent as well, which just isn't something I was expecting. The effects are all practical, gory, and sometimes hilarious. The soundtrack is authentic and moody. This is a perfect modern example of those random horror titles you'd discover on VHS back in the day, while perusing the shelves at some mom and pop video store. I'm looking forward to watching it again.",1473120000,3,1412,4.652
7734673,5,B01EG1R9F2,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If youve never heard of LAKE NOWHERE, don't be surprised; I had never heard of it either, prior to receiving it.  But I wager this film will quickly make a name for itself.  Chocked full of old-school flavor, this little indie gem might be obscure, but it offers a wealth of entertainment.  I haven't had this much fun with a slasher flick in a long time.  Horror fans will definitely want to make a note to grab this one for sure!

Because this film was completely unfamiliar to me, I went into it with no expectations.  But I have to tell you:  this movie is a riot.  The filmmakers captured the nostalgic air of 80s horror so perfectly that its hard to tell this is a modern-day movie.  I love it, and I cannot wait to see what these guys have in store for us next.

LAKE NOWHERE is shot just like the old slashers of yesteryear.  The film is spotty and grainy on purpose in certain spots, but surprisingly this doesnt detract from the experience at all.  If anything, it adds to the atmosphere created by the film itself.  This is difficult to explain, as you have to watch the film and experience it for yourself to understand.

The acting is pretty good, particularly when you consider the cast is trying to appear as 80s actors in a low-budget horror flick.  I have to commend the entire group of doing a great job.  Several of these folks also appear in the commercials that are shown prior to the movie, which makes the whole thing even more fun.

The special effects in LAKE NOWHERE are impressive and look good onscreen.  I would have liked more carnage, even though theres plenty to go around here.  I understand budget constraints, though, and the production crew does an outstanding job with the money available.

LAKE NOWHERE is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  I cannot find a single flaw with this entertaining throwback, and it therefore earns a high degree of respect from this reviewer.  The film is available now in a Limited Edition Blu-ray format, so get your copy soon!",1473120000,,2080,4.473404255319149

7734675,2,B01EG1R9F2,"I was expecting a nostalgia filled slash fest, but I got what amounts to a mediocre student project that doesn't stack up to the likes of Evil Dead. I really wanted to love this, but there just wasn't enough to fall in love with. The Final Girls is far superior. I understand this wasn't meant to be meta, but as a straight slasher/zombie flick, I don't think it works.
On a good note, it did seem like it was filmed in the 80's, so I may be judging too harshly.",1471737600,3,462,4.144444444444445

7734677,4,B01EG1R9F2,"Clocking in at an ultra-lean 51 minutes, ""Lake Nowhere"" (2014) is convincingly presented as if you were watching a distressed tape of an old movie that's been through the VCR eight or 10 times too many. Taking it a step further, it's as if you were watching an old tape of a movie you recorded off TV as evidenced by a few faux commercials at the beginning and several glitches in the feature where what was seemingly recorded over slips through. (Jeez, what a goofy thing for me to feel nostalgic about.) As for the story, it's full slasher retro: a half dozen young people head to a cabin by the lake for a weekend of fun until one of the girls reads a cryptic inscription off a tombstone in an ancient graveyard. A weird masked man from the woods shows up, and -- needless to say -- much blood is spilled. I loved every minute of this throwback movie. There simply needed to be more minutes to love.",1501459200,,902,4.34319526627219
7734678,3,B01EG1R9F2,"I really wanted to like this much more than I did.  Lake Nowhere is intended to recreate the experience of watching a horror movie on VHS in the early 1980's complete with vintage looking video logos, coming attractions and tracking problems.  But the filmmakers take a couple of unnecessary liberties.  One is including a vintage beer commercial which is not something you would have seen on an old VHS rental.  The commercial is for the beer all the characters in the movie happen to be drinking, which is presumably why it was included, but it would have been better off used as part of the special features.  The other is presenting the whole thing in 16:9 widescreen when a vintage VHS image would be cropped to 4:3.  Strangely in the extras section, the teaser trailer for Lake Nowhere is actually cropped to the correct VHS aspect ratio.

For the most part, the filmmakers do a good job of capturing the look and feel of an early 1980's horror film and Lake Nowhere certainly works as a homage to something you might have rented back then.  It's also fun for as far as it goes--but ultimately the problem is that it doesn't go nearly far enough.  Lake Nowhere isn't a straight horror movie like Ti West's The House of the Devil which was a spot on tribute to early 1980's horror films--there's no attempt whatsoever to make Lake Nowhere scary or even mildly suspenseful.  But Lake Nowhere isn't quite a comedy either along the lines of Hobo With A Shotgun or The Editor, which were both amusing tributes to exploitation movies from the early 1980's.  So if Lake Nowhere isn't scary or suspenseful or funny what exactly are you left with?  That's the ultimate problem I have with Lake Nowhere--it functions as an effective tribute to old VHS horror but it doesn't make any effort to be an actual horror movie or a comedy, leaving little more than an empty exercise in style.  Lake Nowhere doesn't have enough ambition to actually be good and it's not something there's much point in sitting through more than once.  It's a cute way to waste an hour but that's about it.",1500940800,,2075,4.618528610354224
7734679,4,B01EG1R9F2,"I'm just finding out about this film and gave it a watch. Seeing as I am an Avid Slasher film lover,especially retro slashers. Everything about this is on point as far as the throwback aspect. Perfect styling,set design camera, work etc.

It's just under an hour and this includes some very cool fake retro previews and a beer commercial that follows suit. The film itself was fun and has some very awesome over the top old school effects. Even though it has such a short running time I didn't feel short changed.

So if you're into retro slashers take a dip in (Lake Nowhere) you'll enjoy yourself and get that old nostalgic feeling.",1499385600,2,634,4.601769911504425

7734685,5,B01EG1R9F2,"Horror films can take many forms they can be psychological (Repulsion), hauntingly beautiful (Picnic at hanging Rock),visually surreal (Antichrist) to total cut throat (High Tension) Lake Nowhere is more of the latter and for this reviewer a welcome addition. Presented in a ""grindhouse"" style were welcomed with some interesting teaser trailers and a commercial to boot. The story were firmiliar with partying kids, the forest, and of course your crazy killer on the prowl but unlike your standard slashers were aware that there is more to this story something  even more ominous then whats clearly onscreen-- For myself Lake Nowhere represents the seed of an idea that i believe the collective (Ravacon) will surely expand upon either in a direct sequel or in a different but clearly relevant other project---the cast is great particularly Villanova as our innocent girl archetype named Bonnie to Nate Wright as our catalyst and resident naked guy- Howk is terrific in a very physical role-- special effects including makeup and on screen are well handled and an excellent opening theme from Stephen Phelps reminiscent of the best of John Carpenter--pop it in have a blast and hope you get out alive",1476230400,,1201,5.127551020408164
7734686,1,B01EG1R9F2,"I generally never leave feedback for any type of products, especially movies.  But this time...this time I feel that I have no choice.  I'll just come out and say it: I absolutely hated this film.  Hated everything about it.  I've been a horror movie fan since I was a little kid, having grown up in the slasher movie craze of the early 80s, the 'golden age of horror', as it's been referred to by some.  Anyhow, I have watched thousands of horror films in my time, from the lowest of low-budget shot-on-video backyard garbage all the way up to the biggest big-budget Hollywood excuses for horror and everything in between.  I very rarely 'hate' a film, but Lake Nowhere rubbed me the wrong way in every single aspect.  Where to begin...the fake commercial and trailers at the start were amusing, probably the only decent thing about the disc.  The feature film, had it only been a trailer itself, would've been a lot easier to sit through.  The full-length film, even with its short 45 minute running time, still had me feeling like I was suffering by the end.  Lake Nowhere is supposed to be set in the 80s, but the filmmakers, probably having grown up in the 90s, didn't have a clue what they were doing when it came to hair, wardrobe and dialogue.  None of it was in the 80s vein.  It wasn't even a solid attempt.  They couldn't even manage to put makeup over the actors' obviously 'not 80s' arm and wrist tattoos.  The cast looked like a bunch of hipsters who went to a thrift store and bought clothes they assumed were from the 80s.  Pretty sure I saw the striped dress the one character was wearing at Target last year.  I know the running time was short, but the characters weren't realized in the least.  You are introduced to them, watch them participate in some drinking games, that's about it before the killing starts. Same goes for the killer not being realized: his outfit looked like something a 4th grader put together.  It was the opposite of scary or menacing.  It looked like a mix of paper mache, leaves, tree bark and glue.  Simply embarrassing.  The kills themselves were, um, pretty bad.  I've seen better kill scenes/gore in films with $25 budgets.  The gore, while getting points for being practical rather than CGI, is pretty laughable.  I really don't enjoy beating up on a film this much, but having read so many GREAT reviews prior to watching this, I was more than let down by this effort.  Getting back to the film - the plot is muddy, especially near the end.  I guess if you want to just watch nonsense featuring a little bit of boobs, some silly gore, an even sillier killer and hipster actors, then this might be the film for you.  If you have respect for yourself and your time, you'll do yourself a favor and skip this shit sandwich altogether.  If you want 80s-inspired horror, try House Of The Devil, The Sleepers or Blood Junkie instead.  Sure, none of those are masterpieces either, but they all do a much better job than Lake Nowhere.  So to summarize: flimsy story, bad hipster acting by non-actors, grade school gore, a silly-looking killer, boring soundtrack, annoying VHS tape effects, so-so fake trailers, uninspired nudity, poor camera work, I could go on and on, but won't dedicate any more time to this film.  Not recommended for anyone, at anytime.  Ever.  Not even the most diehard horror fans should seek this out.  Avoid at all costs.  Makes Black Devil Doll From Hell seem award-worthy.",1474243200,5,3442,4.614497528830313
8758481,1,B01EG1R9F2,"I quite enjoy bad horror films, but this was just a bunch of randomness thrown into a bloody blender. It was short but it took forever to get to the meat of the storyline.

8758482,2,B01EG1R9F2,"Fifty minutes is such a strange running time for a standalone film.  Too short to feel like a real movie, but far too long for a segment in The ABCs of Death or V/H/S or any of the horror anthologies from the past few years.  Lake Nowhere at least had a coherent structure with a beginning, middle, and end, but other than paying tribute to 1980s slasher flicks I don't see what the point of it was.  I think I would have liked it more if the creators had expanded it to 80 or 90 minutes and done something more original with the story, even if they kept the VCR quality visuals.",1528329600,,579,4.151785714285714
8758483,5,B01EG1R9F2,"This is essentially an experimental short film. Please do not think this is a full film. That being said, I judged it along those lines. I would really like to see more from people behind the production. It's spot on with the retro early 80's feel to it almost like the first Evil Dead.

8758484,3,B01EG1R9F2,"Not too terrible. I almost stopped watching because the picture quality was so poor. But the crappy graininess actually made it better. A sort of, Night of the Living Dead poor quality of the film made it seem like it was something you were not supposed to be watching. The gore was well-done to the point of being somewhat gross and disgusting (especially the very last murder). Quite convincing.

8758487,4,B01EG1R9F2,"good throwback. The ""this is a VHS tape"" aesthetic was fun. The story was about as good as a standard low-rent 80's slasher, which put another way is ""not great."" but this was most likely the intention of the filmmaker, as this is clearly a love letter to crappy 80s slasher films.",1522022400,,281,4.423076923076923
8758488,5,B01EG1R9F2,"Masterful. Utterly masterful. The movie isn't simply a horror film, but rather a recreation of a full experience: watching a VHS movie you got from the local brick-and-mortar ma and pa video rental in the 1980's, complete with some idiot's halloween party recorded over a minute of the tape. The movie recreates fake VHS tracking bars. It opens up with 2 fake trailers, a fake beer commercial, and then the movie loads into its main showing, with a quick interruption from the dude that accidentally recorded over the rental. In many ways, it strives to pull off what Ti West tried to do with The Roost and House of the Devil. But rather than make a predictable 80's slasher, the team keeps the 80's production recreation intact, but turns the subgenre on its head, morphing the slasher into an occult monster film.

The only flaw is the run time: at a scant 50 minutes total (including all the stuff I just mentioned to set to mood and feel of the film as an 80's relic) there's not enough time to develop the main feature. What is there is GREEEEEAAAAT, but it ends too abruptly. Another 20-30 minutes should have been appended to the main features to truly exploit its potential. One can only hope that the team makes a follow-up or conversely turns the fake trailer for Harvest Man into its own feature: horror needs more from this crew!",1521936000,4,1341,4.610878661087866
