1687836,4,B0000633ST,"With the release of 1972's Something/Anything?, Todd Rundgren established himself as a major force in the music business. Subsequent albums showed that Rundgren could not be happy merely churning out pop tunes and love songs, and each album he releases is nothing like anything else he's ever done.
As a video pioneer (his Time Heals video was the second-ever video played on MTV in 1981), Todd has always been at the forefront of what's new and cool in visual productions. This collection shows some of his award-winning techniques in computer animation, coupled with musical styles from rock to hip-hop metal. With the advent of desktop publishing and graphic design, Rundgren is able to merge the creativity of his craft with mind-blowing animation effects.
You won't get hits or stage performances with this video, but you will get state-of-the-art animated productions of some of Todd's best works - lyrically, musically and visually. This video, released in 1993, still seems current, even in these times when technology becomes obsolete quickly. Catch it while you can, because Rundgren won't stand still.",1012780800,,1112,5.252808988764045

7958592,5,B0000633ST,"What a fun and entertaining DVD! Video of a studio recording session(no crowd noise)with a live audience...which only Todd would attempt. Fantastic Desktop collection of songs from the new at that time, TR-I = Todd Rundgren Interactive.  Interactive Disc Technology Todd inovated although no longer used in production was revolutionary, allowing one to change the the tempo and arrangemnt of songs. Facist Christ includes the best video ever of that song and few other great No World Order songs. Todd explaines the different versions of the tunes and Interactive Disc Technology. Combined with state of the art computer graphics on Theology and others, way... way ahead of the times, as usuall for Todd. Bonus performance footage of ""too cute to be true"" Michele cooking a human brain. Todd's favorite of his back up singers and soon ""wife to be"" Michele Gray, formerly of the Tubes back up singer and circus performer... whom married Todd in 1998. Just really captivating and worth every dime of your time! You won't be dissapointed if you are a TR I fan. How could you be sceptical??? After all...Todd is  ""A Wizard....A True Star""",1417305600,,1134,4.994708994708994
7958593,5,B0000633ST,"I loved this..lots of inside video of the process he used for this period of music. Fascinating,and beautiful! If only Todd could get in a time machine and be young again so more generations could keep hearing his continuing creative genius and wisdom!",1366934400,3,252,4.883720930232558
7958594,3,B0000633ST,"The video and audio quality of this collection was excellent. The videos included in the Desktop Collection were very entertaining, even though I'd seen most of them before. It was the 2nd Wind Recording Sessions which left me disappointed. All the commentary before each song, explaining a bit about the song, was interesting. The disappointment came when the performances of the songs were cut to about a minute or less. I was looking forward to seeing and hearing how each song on the album was performed. Thus, if you are a fan of the 2nd Wind CD, don't bother buying this DVD.",1194912000,3,581,4.705882352941177
7958595,5,B0000633ST,"If you like Todd, you have to want this. Nothing is better than seeing a live recording. The sound is great and the pictures are even better. If you like the album grab this DVD. I first bought this on VHS and it was borrowed and never returned, so that is the greatness of it. Everyone should see the genious. Get it and enjoy.",1075766400,,328,4.140625
7958596,4,B0000633ST,"I'll admit right up front I am a solid TR fan, and have been for most of his career. His is a unique and rare talent, and this can cause some consternation for people used to the cookie-cutter, assembly-line mindset of most of the music industry. Todd is not afraid to launch off in strange, unusual, and even downright weird  directions, and a hardcore fan like myself delights in the surprises and new ideas he tries, whether they work well or not.
Todd's music ranges from Broadway tunes to blazing heavy metal, and genres I can't even stick a name on. His album concepts are all over the place as well, from being virtually self-done, to vocal only, to having a large band. The bottom line with Todd is expect the unexpected. His musical, technical, and producing talent are legendary. He is a modern marvel.
Okay, enough hero worship. The high point of this DVD for me is the set of music video animations. These were produced with the help of an early render farm setup of Amiga 2000 computers with New Tek Video Toasters and Lightwave software. They have some serious historical value in terms of computer animation and computer platform development. (Yeah, I know there a jillions of you out there saying ""Amiga? What's that? Look it up on the web. Amiga fanatics are still going strong.) This was groundbreaking animation work, folks. The Amiga and New Tek made a huge jump forward in video production and animation. (Remember Babylon 5? Would not have happened without the Amiga and Lightwave.)  Lightwave is still a killer ap, available on other platforms.
Then there is the artistic value, which cannot be measured. I like the animations very much. Being a musician, I am also a big fan of performance music videos, and the full length video in the studio of his song, ""Want of a Nail,"" is great. I would have liked to have seen more of the audience/studio segments go the full length of the song, but if you listen to the commentary, that would be extremely difficult to do, considering the way the pieces were recorded.
Don't buy this thinking you will get a bunch of full-length songs recorded in front of a live audience. (His rare explanations of the meanings of his songs are a cool part of those video segments, however.) Buy it for the animations. It is worth it for those alone.",1074902400,12,2299,4.646191646191646
7958597,4,B0000633ST,"Perhaps some of the other reviewers didn't get far enough to look at the Desktop Collection. 6 full-length videos with great computer animation and a great studio video of ""Want of a Nail"". I'm just now watching the other section, but already feel like I got my moneys worth. The computer animation was way beyond state-of-the-art for videos from the early 90s - and creative/relevant as well.",1042934400,5,393,4.880597014925373
7958598,5,B0000633ST,"It's a little too obvious that these other guys that gave this DVD a poor rating didn't get it. All they want is concert footage? I thinks this shows another amazing side of Todd's talent. The computer art is very inspiring, beautiful and challenging. Todd has always been a great computer artist. The clips of the tour band for the Nearly Human/Second Wind tour show them at work on rehearsals for the songs. I found it very interesting and fascinating, even just the brief clips of each song. It is rare that we even get art of this caliber anymore these days on DVD or CD, so I don't understand what they are really complaining about. I am also a Todd fan that has seen nearly every tour the guy has done, and I am completely satisfied with his work.",1032998400,17,753,4.385714285714286
7958599,1,B0000633ST,"Live?!
Well that's what the packaging says. There is a complete setlist written on the back. The description says its a live performance. But, they failed to tell me there was only 15 seconds of each song. Thats right, 15 SECONDS.
Each track begins with a loose explination of the song by Todd. The band starts to play the song, then, out of nowhere it 'fades' into the next track.
I don't really know the reason for selling a live performance that is missing the performance. I think I just got ripped off, and if I could get my money back, I would.",1026432000,6,550,4.349514563106796
7958600,5,B0000633ST,"What can be bad?  Let me change that...his ""Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect"" was actually a video/dvd I could have lived without.  But the 2nd Wind Sessions..I have seen before and really enjoyed the insight into the recording process and the fun the performers..and the audience seem to have.  Plus Todd cracks me the hell up anyway.  The DeskTop Collection I have also seen before and enjoyed.  Todd is sadly underappreciated.  His induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is long overdue.  He has participated in some of the seminars that are held there...one would think his induction would have occurred by now.  Although he will be inducted...I am bothered that it hasn't happened yet. But...I digress.  This DVD is really quite good and immensely entertaining...his music is timeless...hits home every time.",1019433600,3,823,5.082089552238806
