2691973,4,B000KJTFEI,"The first animated Hellboy movie to make it's way onto DVD, Hellboy: Sword of Storms may feature a voice cast comprised of those who appeared in the live action film, but the animated film's story, spirit, and delivery are blatently directly inspired from Mike Mignola's genre bending comic.  Sword of Storms begins with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), pyro Liz (Selma Blair), and fish boy Ape Sapien (Doug Jones) assigned to check out reports of a professor becoming posessed by demonic Japanese spirits.  Soon enough, Hellboy is trapped in another world and fighting to get out while learning the secrets of the spirits, while Liz and Abe get in over their heads with all sorts of badness.  The animation may be an acquired taste for some, but it is what it is, and it's well done enough.  The voice acting is superb, and as said before, the overall story and tone of Sword of Storms maintains the spirit of fun and originality that Mignola's comic has done so often.  The DVD itself is packed with worthwhile special features which in itself is a welcome surprise, which rounds out a great package that's more than worth it's list price.  All in all, if you dig Hellboy, comic or movie or both, pick this up.",1171152000,6,1202,4.672985781990521
2691974,4,B000KJTFEI,"I know the fan community is going to foam at the mouth over this, but I'm not really a fan of Hellboy.  I picked this up because Tad Stones said I would like it.

Tad Stones is the supervising producer, and is also responsible for the story and screenplay together with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola, and also directed together with Phil Weinstein.  I trust Tad's recommendation because I'm familiar with some of his other work, although given his far-reaching responsibility for the finished product, I expected his opinion to be slightly biased.

So dealing with this without any pre-conceived notions about what Hellboy ""should"" look like, I have to admit that I thought Tad Stones and company did a pretty decent job of it.

The storyline is pretty ""stock"", the main protagonist must embark on a mystical quest.  Along the way he runs into an assortment of nasty things that don't want him to complete said quest, and therefore try to do him in.

The animation is well-done for the current crop of made-for-television animation, where the key drawings are done in house and the film is then shipped overseas for the ""in-between"" work.  Production values therefore aren't up to Disney/Pixar standards, but are quite high nonetheless, with the exception of a couple of continuity errors here and there that I noticed.

There are some unintentionally amusing moments with American artists trying to render mythical creatures from Japanese folklore.  They try hard, but can't quite pull it off.  It still makes for an entertaining device, and to be honest only people very familiar with Japanese folklore will notice the inconsistencies.

The vocal cast is passionate about the work and turns in a fine performance.  They convey the tone of each moment without being overwhelming, and it's a fine blending of visual and aural imagery.

The real reason why you should pick this up, especially if you're a fan of animation in general, is the lovely crop of extras that come on the DVD.  A series of presentations about Mignola's original artwork and the trouble of translating it for the medium, the character designs, and the voice work give one a real insight into the capabilities and limitations of mainstream animation as it exists today.  There's a lot of behind-the scenes material here, unusual for an animated feature, that compels you to pay some attention to the ""men (and women) behind the curtain"".  Current-day animation hardly holds a candle to the classical animation of the forties and fifties, animation's ""Golden Age"", and it's instructive to see why.

To sum up - Good for a first effort by Tad Stones and his team, a few rough spots which I imagine will be dealt with in future releases, and a really nice set of extras that give great insight to the state of the animation industry today.",1170979200,3,2807,4.886075949367089
2691975,4,B000KJTFEI,"I liked it. It was a bit manga, but the theme of the episode is Japanese, so it can be expected. I was expecting more of a ""Batman the animated series"" look but it was more ""Jackie Chan adventures"". The story is good and the action fast. It isn't for kids, as the language is in the pg area. ""Hey dumb-a**, now I'm pis**d"" and there's also a lot of decapitaion, violence and cartoon killing like a lot of manga. It feels a little like ninja scroll in the quest with the sword and the many monster trials he faces to get to the climax. I look forward to the second installment and a more familiar hellboy setting.

One weird thing about the dvd, every time a monster is about to attack, a computer generated fox shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen. Anyone know what the deal is with that?",1170892800,5,801,4.201298701298701
2691976,4,B000KJTFEI,"The world's greatest paranormal detective continues his battle against the forces of evil in ""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"". When a university professor of mythology opens an old forbidden scroll and becomes possessed by ancient Japanese demons, the secretive Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense sends Hellboy and a team of agents to Japan to investigate. While examining the crime scene, Hellboy discovers a cursed samurai sword and is transported to a supernatural dimension of Japanese folklore. From comic book creator Mike Mignola and director Guillermo Del Toro, ""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" is a very entertaining animated adventure that fans of the comic book hero Hellboy will certainly get quite a kick out of it. An engaging storyline, stylized animation, cool action sequences and Ron Perlman's outstanding voice talents highlight this well produced extension of the ""Hellboy"" franchise. The voice cast also includes Selma Blair, Doug Jones and Peri Gilpin.

""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" is a truly excellent DVD. The animated feature is presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a rich and colorful video transfer and a great 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. The DVD is also packed with an insightful audio commentary with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola and production crew, three short but informative behind-the-scenes featurettes (To Hell and Back, A New Breed & Conquering Hellboy), a 42-minute Comic-Con panel discussion, four trailers and colorful interactive menus. Overall, ""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" scores a worthy ""B"".",1170633600,13,1557,5.514644351464435
2691977,5,B000KJTFEI,"This animated movie's story is more in line with the Hellboy comic book stories than the live-action movie was, and while officially unrated, it's similar to the live-action movie and the comic books.  I'd probably give Sword of Storms a PG-13, with [...].

I love, LOVE, the mythical creatures used in this movie, it's much like the comic in that way.  I have a softspot for folklore monsters being used in comics, books, & movies, especially when it's normally obscure folklore stories (like the Japanese flying heads or the Baba Yaga, for instance... Hellboy comic readers know what I'm talking about).  I'm just not into the Marvel spandex-and-cape-wearing superheroes, they don't appeal to me at all, so in contrast, Hellboy and his friends feel like the perfect superheroes to me.

Voice acting is great here, though I'm biased because I couldn't imagine Hellboy's voice before Ron Perlman took the part.  The other actors do a great job as well, and the sound effects were great (I watched it with surround sound when it was on TV).  The animation has great lighting and colors, I thought (I say ""great"" way too much, I know), although the characters do look a little, well, ""Kim Possible"".  Just a little.  Not a bad job, though. I kept up with the  movie's production diary on another website, and Tad Stones (the movie's director) was saying why they had to do that style for the animation: Hellboy needed eyebrows to show expression, Kate looks younger than she does in the Mignola comics because in animation any lines on her face would make her look like she was 70, etc.  Stuff like that.

Last thing, it's not mentioned here in Amazon's info, but every DVD of the 1st run (first 300,000, I believe) will come with a 32 page Hellboy comic called ""Phantom Limbs"", story by Jim Pascoe, art by Rick Lacey, inside the DVD case, along with a pin up by Mike Mignola.  This info is straight from director Tad Stones, as another way to entice you to buy the DVD.  Well, it worked for me, I'm buying it!  A great way to feed my Hellboy habit while I wait for BPRD: The Universal Machine to land on my doorstep.",1170288000,8,2115,4.617647058823529
2691978,4,B000KJTFEI,"HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS is the first of two (so far) animated Hellboy films; it debuted on the Cartoon Network on October 28, 2006. The second animated offering, HELLBOY: BLOOD AND IRON, is slated to air in 2007. For those not in the know, Hellboy is a very popular and successful Dark Horse comic book character conceived, written, and illustrated by long time comic book artist Mike Mignola. HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS is not a follow up film to the live action HELLBOY, but, instead, bears a closer similarity to the comic book version. Here, for example, Hellboy and Liz do not have a romantic relationship and Abe Sapien is not psychic. However, pertinent cast members from the live action movie do lend their voices to this animated effort, with the exception of the film-uncredited David Hyde Pierce, who had originally voiced over Doug Jones's Abe Sapien role. Here, Doug Jones gets a chance to do his own vocal work, and he doesn't suck.

Some more background for the casual viewer: Hellboy, a baby demon summoned to Earth by Nazi occultists in 1944 - during WW2's final days - and subsequently adopted and raised by the U.S. Army from infanthood on, is one of the good guys. Hellboy makes a powerful ally as his demonic origins equip him with superhuman strength, near invulnerability, an immunity to fire, and a gigantic stone hand (called the Right Hand of Doom, which is prophesied to be instrumental in bringing about the Apocalypse; but that's got nothing to do with this film). Hence, the big coat-wearing, big gun toting, now mature Hellboy has become the primary agent of the U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, an entity dedicated to defending humanity from supernatural threats. Which now brings us to HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS.

SPOILERS ALERT: When a Japanese folklore expert reads and is possessed by a mystical scroll, the B.P.R.D. sends Hellboy and a team of agents to Japan to look into things. They quickly learn that the possessed professor and a certain enchanted sword are the keys to unleashing the Storm Demons, Thunder and Lightning, who, in turn, upon release, will summon their brothers, the Dragons, to lay waste to the world. During the course of the investigation, Hellboy chances upon the sword, picks it up, and is instantly transported to the horrific fairy-tale world of Japanese mythology, where folklore legends are real and mostly...not very welcoming.

Meanwhile, the team members back home press on and attempt to locate the possessed professor. They are also encumbered with their own challenges (the aforementioned professor now effecting meteorological mishaps, an implacable sea leviathan, and animated furniture which would horrify the Disney empire). In the end, of course, the fate of the world is left in the mismatched hands of Hellboy. However, he faces a perplexing quandary as he learns that, to get back home, the Sword of Storms must be shattered, but that the same act will cause the demons Thunder and Lightning to be freed into our world.

Creator Mike Mignola's storytelling leans heavily on the horror aspects of worldwide folklore and mythology. In fact, he revels in it. This time out, he delves deep into Japanese folklore as he has his hero facing off against the Rokurokubi (human-looking creatures who can elongate their necks), a Gataro (the cucumber-loving, shelled water demon), a Tsuchigumo (the arachnid woman), a group of Nukekubi (human-appearing monsters, who, at night, are able to detach their heads from their bodies), and your generic Oni (your basic demon or ogre). Hellboy, by the way, has already had a prior encounter with the Nukekubi (in a story titled ""Heads"") as evidenced by his decisive actions in dealing with them here. The only supernatural being who, on the surface, doesn't seem to have it in against Hellboy is the kitsune, an intelligent fox who imparts advice to our demon protagonist. HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS.

Those who've experienced Hellboy only thru the live action movie have been missing out on some great, distinctive art by Mike Mignola; viewers are urged to check out Dark Horse's various Hellboy releases (in particular, HELLBOY: SEED OF DESTRUCTION, the initial Hellboy graphic novel). With his minimalist style, prodigious use of the color black and his propensity for heavy shadows in juxtaposition with the more vivid hues, Mignola excels in establishing a dark, atmospheric universe for his hero, with a design steeped in steampunk technology and Gothic visuals. Unfortunately, Mignola's artwork isn't fully translated to this film. While the color palette here is somewhat and sometimes reminiscent of Milogna's preferences, there are several sequences where the design and the look stray from Mignola's stark and brooding artistic renderings; at times, it even has a tendency to more closely resemble the JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES in its style and sensibilities. Not that that's a bad thing; it just isn't Mike Mignola art. I don't mean to quibble but I was hoping to be exposed to a cohesive animation done up ala Mignola; instead, I only get glimpses. Just, more darkness next time, please.

The voice actors do a decent job. Ron Perlman is invaluable as the taciturn Hellboy, whose battle cry seems to be, ""Oh, crap."" Selma Blair returns vocally as Liz Sherman, who still doesn't have full confidence in her pyrokinetic gifts. I've gotta say that Liz's cartoon incarnation doesn't look at all like Selma Blair, but, it's no big deal. Doug Jones as the amphibian Abe Sapien does a good job mimicking David Hyde Pierce's verbal mannerisms, while Peri Gilpin comes on to the series as Professor Kate Corrigan.

Based on HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS, I'm looking forward to HELLBOY: BLOOD AND IRON. Come to think of it, I also can't wait 'til the second feature film comes out. While SWORD OF STORMS does suffer from an unexceptional, straight-forward plot and a lack of character-driven moments (one exception is the underwater scene between Liz and Abe and their interaction afterwards), the viewer does become privy to plenty of demon-slaying action and a lesson in Japanese folklore. So, while I think it's pretty cool, it doesn't really resonate within me on an emotional level. But, hey, let's not go further down that path. The Hellboy franchise will always be more of a visual vehicle than a stage for the touchy-feelies. So, if you get kicks out of watching Lovecraftian monsters, a no-nonsense hero demon armed with a friggin' gynormous gun, and superpowered misfits all wrapped up in a nice Gothic/pulp adventure package, then Hellboy is right up your alley. Three and a half stars for this one. Oh, and if you're gonna check out HELLBOY: SWORD OF STORMS, then you might as well also get the excellent AMAZING SCREW-ON HEAD, also by Mike Mignola.",1167523200,12,6780,5.015985790408526
2691979,5,B000KJTFEI,"I enjoyed the movie and read the books and graphic novels. So, when I realized it was on CN, I DVR it. It is excellent animation and really did a nice job of capturing the animation style. The diaglogue was tuned down a bit as it was on CN at 8pm, not on Adult swim. The actors from the film did the VoiceOvers i.e. Ron Pearlman as Hellboy.

Abe Sapien: You just made the newbie face.

Hellboy: Oh, crap.

Hellboy: You're not a normal fox.

Fox: And you are not a normal man.

Hellboy: Really? What gave me away? Any idea why I'm here?

Fox: Do I look like a philosopher?

Hellboy: Nice.

Fox: You carry the sword of storms, and it has tasted the blood of demons. That is all you need to know. For now.

Hellboy: Sure, 'cause that's just so much to absorb all at once.

Fox: [leaving] Don't cut yourself.

Hellboy: Hey, kiddo. How you doing?

Liz Sherman: Great. For a walking napalm strike...

Abe Sapien: You saved our lives, Liz.

Liz Sherman: I practically torched you. Not to mention a couple of dozen miyans. Sorry about the burns ...

Abe Sapien: Barely a sunburn.

Hellboy: Come on, they were mummies. And they were trying to kill you. Trust me, there's no upside to cutting the undead ANY slack.

Abe Sapien: You did what you had to do.

Liz Sherman: I lost control, is what I did. If you hadn't stopped me, I probably would have melted the place, and probably the two of you. I can handle the little stuff fine, but when I try anything big... God, the Bureau should lock me up! I'm the real monster!

[Hellboy and Abe begin laughing]

Liz Sherman: Okay, okay, I get it.

Hellboy: [wiping his eyes] No, no, you're the monster, all right. Me and Abe, we... I mean, you're lucky we let you be seen with us.

Abe Sapien: [chuckling] It's true. You do cramp our style.

Hellboy: The world needs what we can do. That makes us good guys. That's enough for me.

2692008,4,B000KJTFEI,"Sword of Storms(released Feb/06)stars the voices of Ron Perlman in the title role of Hellboy,Selma Blair as Liz and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien. All actors of course starred in the original Hellboy roles on film and I can honestly tell you if any of them or none of them had been involved with this project,I would have given it a wide pass. Rarely,if ever,can other voice actors,as good as they may be,ever hit the right dynamic of the originals. This film manages to get it right,right from the start and it is a joy to watch.
The film itself starts off with the team defeating a group of ancient demons in an underground temple. After this they head home for some much needed r&r,but Hellboy is pegged to accompany a Professor Corrigan to the home of a professor who specializes in ancient Japanese mythology. It seems the professor had obtained an ancient manuscript detailing a story about a samurai who imprisoned the thunder and lightning gods inside his sword,and who are brothers to the dragon gods. Unfortunately he was turned to stone and he never returned to rescue his lady fair in a temple. As the professor reads the manuscript he is possessed by a demon and he goes in search of the samurai's original sword. He finds it but cannot obtain it,but before he flees he reeks havoc on its owner.
Professor Corrigan,Hellboy,a psychic and two other members of the bureau in haz-mat suits arrive to investigate. Hellboy finds and picks up the sword and suddenly he is transported to Japan. Hellboy will meet up with several demons along his journey such as a spider woman,headless men and women,a thing Hellboy calls""turtle boy"",and others. All these demons are put in his way by the possessed Japanese professor,so he/they may try to obtain the sword. Of course Hellboy never lets the sword out of his reach for any length of time and,when necessary,lets his fists do the persuading for him.
Liz and Abe fly to Japan to rescue Hellboy but they are caught in a terrible storm and their plane goes down in heavy seas,killing the two pilots. Liz barely survives,and only because Abe gives her his breath(or burps as Abe later calls them)far underwater. They come upon a very small rocky outcropping in the ocean and they have their hands full with a very large underwater demon.
When they finally defeat the demon a small fox appears to guide them straight to Hellboy,who coincidentally has been helped by the same fox already and is now finally confronting the Thunder and Lightning gods. Hellboy was tricked by the previous demon he defeated and broke the sword unleashing the gods. Their unleashing has also triggered the slow stirrings of their brothers the dragon gods and if they defeat Hellboy,they will all rule the world.
Hellboy has a full plate as he and the gods battles back and forth. In the end Hellboy picks up the two pieces of the broken sword and that is what finally brings down his foes.
The film is about 75 minutes long,not including credits,but it goes by fairly quick. The action is pretty constant and the voices of the original actors bring each character to vivid life. The only one who is not quite constantly ""on"" is Blair. She falters a bit at the beginning but as the film progresses she thankfully gets up to speed. The animation is terrific and there are unforgettably brief moments such as Hellboy walking through a forest whose ground is covered in colourful leaves,with the odd leaf falling here and there,which are absolutely gorgeous. The film is well paced,imaginative and true to the Hellboy spirit,so how can it lose? Not only are the original actors voicing their film roles but director Guillermo Del Toro is also on deck to help guide the film. You do not have to have seen the films to enjoy this animated version as their is a brief explanation at the beginning,of the bureau's and Hellboys origins.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras abound here with audio commentary,several featurettes with one being the Comic-Con of 2006 intro'ing this film to the audience there with a panel discussion,and much,much more. Also included is a Hellboy mini comic book!
All in all a solid entry in the Hellboy cannon. The original voices and creators are on board this project which certainly upped the credibility factor. It's a nicely paced,plotted and beautifully animated film from start to finish. Recommended.",1351123200,,4405,4.782152230971128
2692009,5,B000KJTFEI,"...this is an animated film, based on the Hellboy comics as much as on the live-action movies. All the original voice cast from the live-action movies, is still here. The art style, is something of a cross between, the comic art and the animation style of the newer Fantastic Four cartoon. The story concerns, ancient gods released from a samurai sword who bring dragons into the world and Hellboy time travels and it's really a lot easier, when you watch it. Well...it's great fun and I recommend it, to anyone who likes the live-action films!",1315353600,,544,4.7368421052631575
2692010,4,B000KJTFEI,The quality of the video was good but the plot was thin.  Ron Perlman and the other actors played their parts well but were limited by the script.  I'd stay with the movies and the other cartoon of hellby which was superior to this one.,1287014400,,236,4.222222222222222
2692011,4,B000KJTFEI,"Sword of Storms makes the transfer from graphic novel to animated feature brilliantly.  This story centers around Japanese mythology, beginning with the BPRD (Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense) investigating a mysterious demonic possession.  Hellboy picks up a magic samurai sword and is transported to a magical realm where he must reenact the journey of a samurai warrior (with plenty of creepy Japanese mythological monsters!)  Abe and Liz face off against dragons in the real world, while agent Corrigan track down the demon possessed professor.  Wielding the Sword of Storms, Hellboy must escape the alternate dimension and prevent the demonic gods of Lightning and Thunder from escaping their prison inside the sword.

Sword of Storms is everything you love about Hellboy.  It's well written, creepy, adventurous, mythological, packs plenty of fist-to-face action, and downright hilarious.  It utilizes the paranormal and Japanese mythology but keeps itself from getting too weird, making it accessible to a general audience.  Sword of Storms success is greatly due to its production team.  They worked with Mike Mignola (the graphic novel author) and kept the same actors who worked on the Hellboy major motion pictures.  This consistency from graphic novel to film and back to animated feature keeps the Animated Hellboy movies strong and familiar.  Overall, I enjoyed Sword of Storms more than the silver screen Hellboy adaptations.",1278720000,,1450,5.486486486486487

2692013,5,B000KJTFEI,"We love it. It's a great story and well scripted. My 8 yr olds love it as much as I do. It's not dumbed down, so there's enough of a plot to hold adult interest... provided you aren't above watching a cartoon of a comic book hero. ;)",1246665600,,233,3.875
2692014,3,B000KJTFEI,"Japanese folklore is rich with monsters and demons... so it seems appropriate that Hellboy would encounter one or two along his way.

And the animated spinoff movie ""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" does a decent enough job ushering some fun Japanese goblins and monsters into Mike Mignola's world. The entire storyline is rather straightforward and bogged down by a tepid tragic-love-story-from-the-past that putters out, but Hellboy's adventures in a menacing Wonderland and  the attacking dragons make for a good adventure story.

First off: the team ventures into a green, slimy, root-filled underground temple, where they must battle an ancient bat-deity and a small army of Aztec mummies. Then to the main plot -- a history professor receives an ancient scroll that tells the story of the demonic brothers Thunder and Lightning, and a doomed love between a princess and a young samurai. And when the professor finds the samurai's sword -- surprise! -- he gets possessed by the demons.

But when the BPRD is called in, Hellboy touches the sword as well -- and is sucked into a bizarre otherworld full of monsters, ghosts and magical creatures. In the meantime, Abe and Liz are caught in a typhoon that strands them in the middle of nowhere -- and it turns out that dragons are on the way. To save human civilization, Hellboy must not only escape from the otherworld of Japenese legend, but also deal with the demons and some tragic ghosts....

""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" is not quite the twisty, mysterious tale that its sister story ""Blood and Iron"" is: it's a pretty straightforward action/fantasy story of monstrous creatures about to be unleashed on the world, and a rather sentimental ghostly ""Romeo and Juliet"" tale. The latter is the weakest part of the entire movie, actually -- none of the ghosts are very interesting, and the climax of their subplot just sputters out and dissolves like a wet firecracker.

Fortunately the rest of the story is more entertaining -- lots of thunderstorms, very angry dragons, and Hellboy's rather peeved journey through a very creepy world of Japanese legend. Bouncing-head goblins, a vicious kappa (""He really likes cucumbers... WHAT IS YOUR NAME?!""), an eerie spider-woman who spins bloodied threads on an instrument, and a fox that has a knack for turning into a wise old lady all make appearances, and most of them end up at the wrong end of Hellboy's stone fist.

Of note: The head-goblins actually are from a Mike Mignola short story that goes the same way, but the writers managed to sneak in a few other references to Mignola's comics (including Katie rambling about a mythic king and his berserker warriors).

Ron Perlman's vocals make this Hellboy absolutely perfect -- he's sarcastic but good-hearted (""You're lucky we let you be seen with us!""), while Doug Jones is excellent as the resourceful, mellow fish-man Abe. Selma Blair has some trouble (which she admits, if you watch the making-of featurette) making Liz sound lively, but after some initial rockiness she does manage it. And the animation is pretty good stuff -- the jewel-toned landscapes of Japanese legend have a bad habit of turning into spooky nightmares.

""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" suffers somewhat from a padded ghostly-romance subplot, but the rest of it is a solid, straightforward tale of Japanese folklore and the occasional cursed sword. Worthwhile spinoff.",1235260800,,3383,5.048387096774194

2692016,5,B000KJTFEI,"Released in 2006, Sword of Storms was the first Hellboy Animated DVD in which a Japanese professor of folklore opens and reads a scroll which causes two demons to possess him. These demons wish to wreak havoc upon the world of the humans. It is up to Hellboy to stop them.

I loved the animation, the style and the plot of this story (some parts came straight from the comic books). I thought the Japanese mythology aspect was absolutely wonderful (Hellboy must outwit, outsmart and outfight many Japanese demons and ghosts). I also love Hellboy's wit and sarcasm. He makes me chuckle every time.

The DVD itself is very good. It has enough extra features to satisfy without becoming overwhelming (I thought the director's cut of the live action Hellboy DVD was almost too much). Plus, the extra little comic book included was a nice side story with more Hellboy action and wit told with more great art. I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of Hellboy, underground comics, animation or just plain good movies.",1226275200,,1011,4.738636363636363

2692025,4,B000KJTFEI,"Hellboy: Sword of Storms is the first of the Hellboy Animated series based on Mike Mignola's popular comic book series called Hellboy. It is directed by Phil Weinstein & Tad Stones and written by Mike Mignola & Tad Stones. It features the vocal talents of: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, and Peri Gilpin. A Japanese professor of folklore named Professor Sakai opens a forbidden scroll and becomes possessed by the ancient Japanese demons of Thunder and Lightning, who seek to return and summon their brothers, the Dragons, to dominate the human world. The BPRD is brought in after Sakai attacks one of his associates. But, when Hellboy picks up an ancient sword, he disappears into a weird land of Japanese mythology. In the meantime, BPRD agents Corrigan and Russell Thorne (a psychic) follow the trail of the possessed professor, while Abe and Liz are stranded on an island in the middle of the ocean where they battle one of the Dragons.

I got to be honest, I was expecting more from the first animated feature. I was expecting it to have a much darker tone, like the comics or even the movie but it doesn't. Overall, though, it is a good animated feature. Well worth getting if you're into Hellboy or animation. Just don't expect it to be as spectacular as you might think it'd be & you'll do just fine.",1220572800,2,1315,4.668103448275862

2692028,4,B000KJTFEI,"Hellboy serves up exactly what I love.  Creator Mike Mignola pits his gruff red giant against a magical mystery tour of the world's dark realm of gods and monsters, delving deep into authentic folklore and legends, serving up a concoction that is part scholarly research, part Gothic horror, and full-on balls-out entertainment.  The problem comes when transferring a creation that is such a singular vision of its creator, with a unique art-style and atmosphere, into a fluid medium.  It is rarely going to be a complete success, and the best attempts come when the  animation team brings something new to the character, something that couldn't be achieved within the confines of the printed page.

""Hellboy: Sword of Storms"" attempts to strike a balance between the ""Hellboy"" movie, which was a decent adaptation, and the original comic.  Most of the original cast has been brought in for the voices, which is a real coupe as they are already familiar with the characters.  That makes a nice grounding point for the audience as well, as there are no shocks or disappointments when they start speaking.  The animation could have been a little stronger, and shows the influence of Paul Dini's now-familiar ""The Animated Series"" style that most comic animations follow.  In the DVD extras, it is revealed that the animators wanted to use the actual look of Mignola's art-style, but they were contractually forbidden to do so, which is a bit of a shame.

For the storyline, Hellboy is sent against the invisible realms of Japanese mythology, attempting to return back to the physical world while retaining possession of the Sword of Storms, a mystical samurai sword, and thus save the world.  As usual, the monsters are all authentic creatures from Japan,  including the gods of Thunder and Lightning. He takes on a kappa, an oni, a joroguma, rokurokubi and the collection of nukekubi that was adapted from the Mignola story ""Heads"".  Even with the deviations in the visual style, the story is pure Hellboy, and it is great to see it animated. I do miss the subtlety of the comic, with the tiny background details that manifest the atmosphere, but even without that I would call this a successful adaptation.

The DVD extras are a real boost as well, with interviews with Mignola detailing the creation of Hellboy, and even more fascinating are interviews with the director and animation team explaining the choices they made when transferring the comic to moving pictures. Its makes one a little more forgiving when you realize the compromises that had to be made, and they they did their best to retain the integrity of the work of art they all adore.",1193961600,3,2651,4.914798206278027
2692029,3,B000KJTFEI,"I am not a huge Mike Mignola or Hellboy fan just so you know where I stand.  Not that I have anything against them, I think he's a creative writer and artist and that Hellboy is definitely an awesome character.  I thought the live action movie had a cool look to it so once Hellboy made the leap to the animated world, I couldn't resist.

The first thing that stood out to me when I started watching it was the music.  It's sounds just like the live action soundtrack which helps you remember this is an extension of the movie and not a Saturday morning cartoon.  The character designs for animation are pretty bright and cartoony, but not to the point of being distracting.  I suppose it could have been a little more dark and shadowy like the comic but that's a minor complaint.  The voice acting is pretty decent, Ron Pearlman's voice proves to be just as well suited for the animated Hellboy as the live action one.  Selma Blair was a little bland but so is her character I guess.  Plus this was her first time doing animation so I suppose she deserves a break.  Doug Jones takes over the voice of Abe from David Hyde Pearce and I guess they liked him so much he'll now be voicing him in the live action sequel.  Peri Gilpin also joins the cast and adds a new dynamic to the team.  The only one missing is Prof. Broom unfortunately.

The featurettes on here are great, with plenty of behind the scenes, interviews with Mignola about creating Hellboy, and a very in depth look at the character design during the comic con panel.  It even comes with a mini comic of the animated Hellboy.  So while I think it was a cool idea and had some decent action, I think they could do better, and am looking forward to checking out the sequel Blood and Iron.",1193011200,,1750,4.341538461538462
2692030,4,B000KJTFEI,"The animated tales of Hellboy, brought first to television by Cartoon Network and then to DVD by Anchor Bay, follow Hellboy and his friends in the B.P.R.D. through a few more days at the office. Sword of Storms begins with the acquisition of a little something on the origins of something really terrible, connects the dots with a wonderful sword and a nice little demon that has an interesting tale empowering it all, and ends with - well, that would spoil all the fun. It incorporates the minds behind the Hellboy movie, looks into the mind behind the character, and gives a good animation team a great project and a nice little tale of Japanese conundrums. The tale is a good one in my mind, too; if you follow Hellboy and like the design of the work that Mignola and others have put into the unique storytelling Hellboy often encounters then this is something of a nice trip. It is different in some ways when you add in a carton appeal, but Hellboy has always adapted quite well and does so here as well.

The one thing I have to say about Hellboy is that you know something like this never leads to any type of horrible conclusion. The main pieces of the puzzle never fall to the wayside, the evil elements are always a little on the oddity side of the spectrum, and some of the pieces are just there to be a bit strange. Still, this is Mignola working on the film so you know it will have good composition, something to say on the horror that is the ""it"" in our tale of twisted time, and it will be enjoyable.
When you add the fact that you do not have to watch commercials into the equation it makes it A LOT better. I actually bought it because I couldn't stand the disruption that those brought and was glad I did so.

If you expect something really dark, you might be a tad disappointed. It is a cartoon and, despite what can be done with cartoons, it is slightly toned down. It still has the twisted mind of Mignola, though, and that makes the watch pleasing. So, if you like Hellboy, this might be something for you. It has a fairytale quality (with Hellboy punching it now and again) and makes for a light audio-visual lunch.
Also, pick up Hellboy: Blood and Iron and The Amazing Screw-On Head if Mignola-based material is something you want/ need on DVD.",1192924800,4,2269,4.4
2692031,4,B000KJTFEI,"The beginning of the Hellboy Animated series, first off I should point out to lovers of the movie that Hellboy Animated Sword of Storms and it's sequels follow a different plot line then the movie does. Example... Hellboy and Liz are not lovers, (In fact Abe and Liz share a suggestive scene) The world knows about the B.P.R.D. and Hellboy. I haven't read the comics but I belive that these stories are more in the spirt of them, then the movie was. The cast from the movie returns to play there charecter's. Theres a surprising amount of bonus material so thats good. Those who enjoy Sword of Storms will also enjoy it's sequel Blood & Iron just as much if not more.

Parents be warned that while these stories are sutiable for a young audeince some stricter folks may find issues with one or two things, (But I really don't see a problom for most folks) and adults need not worry just because there animated and were originaly shown on the Cartoon Network they have not been dumbed down or filtered out.",1191456000,3,1116,4.502463054187192

It's not animated in Mignola's distinct style (see the animated Screw-on Head) but the artwork does manage enough of a satisfactory flow to tell the story well.  The tale itself is pretty original (with a little Mignola-created material thrown in) and well-done so as to keep the viewer interested throughout the movie's length.  Best of all, it is not totally ""dumbed down"" for children the way many animated takes on comic icons are, and does in fact use several curse words, though the violence is creatively muted.

Lucky for you there are several items currently available that should (at least temporarily) quench your thirst.

If you'd like to relive the movie, try the HELLBOY novelization, by Yvonne Navarro. Navarro is an old hand at adapting screen properties, both large and small (she's done several BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER books, plus novelizations of SPECIES I and II) and can be counted on to do so in a readable and entertaining manner. Her work on HELLBOY is no exception. Writing from director Guillermo del Toro's script, and adding in her own little extras based on her intimate knowledge of the source material (she even gets HELLBOY's alternative spelling of ""pancakes,"" substituting ""m"" for ""n"", correct), she produces a faithful adaptation of the movie. If you like her HELLBOY book, you might also sample some of Navarro's original novels. Books like AFTERAGE and MIRROR ME (available from The Overlook Connection Press), THAT'S NOT MY NAME, FINAL IMPACT, and RED SHADOWS are all well worth your time and money.

If you wish to explore the comics that inspired the film, there are several reasonably priced HELLBOY collections available from Dark Horse Comics. The movie's main inspiration comes from HELLBOY: SEED OF DESTRUCTION, written and drawn by HELLBOY 's creator, Mike Mignola, with an able assist from the venerable John Byrne of Superman and X-Men fame. HELLBOY: CONQUEROR WORM explores ideas Mignola touched on in SEED OF DESTRUCTION, finally explaining the origins of the strange race of aliens who appeared in that story.

If you like those, you can sample HELLBOY: WAKE THE DEVIL, HELLBOY: THE CHAINED COFFIN, and HELLBOY: THE RIGHT HAND OF DOOM. WAKE THE DEVIL is one long story, the other two volumes present several stand alone short stories which explore world mythology and folklore (THE CHAINED COFFIN features ""The Corpse"", an amusing tale whose events feature prominently in the movie). To see how other folks handle HELLBOY and his eclectic supporting cast, try BPRD: HOLLOW EARTH AND OTHER STORIES, and HELLBOY: WEIRD TALES.

If plain old prose is what floats your boat, there are several worthy original HELLBOY novels, among them HELLBOY: ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HELL by Brian Hodge, HELLBOY: THE GOD MACHINE by Thomas Sniegoski, HELLBOY: UNNATURAL SELECTION by Tim Lebbon, and three by Christopher Golden (of OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS fame), namely HELLBOY: THE LOST ARMY, HELLBOY: THE BONES OF GIANTS, and HELLBOY: THE DRAGON POOL.  Golden also ably edited HELLBOY: ODD JOBS, an anthology featuring short stories by the likes of the aforementioned Brian Hodge, Poppy Z. Brite, Nancy Collins, Greg Rucka, and Chet Williamson.",1175212800,,2861,5.117773019271948

2692054,4,B000KJTFEI,"Live action translates perfectly into animation in this feature-length Hellboy adventure. What makes it even better is that the main cast return to do the voices and Marco Beltrami's main theme is used. A lot of animated spin-offs in the past have proved to be just as good when taken seriously by the makers (Animatrix, Spider-Man) but, in my opinion, Hellboy: Sword of Storms was good enough for a theatrical release. A small one, like Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.

The story has HB, Liz and Abe go to Japan where a local historian has gone missing and a priceless exhibit damaged. While at the scene, HB wanders off, following a strange Fox and ends up trapped somewhere in time. Liz and Abe have no idea where he is but have their own problems to deal with as the weather takes a turn for the worse.

Stuck in ancient Japan, HB must deal with a bunch of vampires, demons and monsters in an effort to get home. Easier said than done.

I liked the movie, but felt it lacked something. Still, it made me interested in the character, even though I have yet to buy a single Hellboy comic book. After watching this however, I can't wait to get some more of HB. The animation style follows that of the comic pretty closely and the color pallet ranges from very bright and very colorful to moody and atmospheric. It's very impressive and highly detailed. Don't expect 'saturday morning' style animation here.

If you are seriously into Hellboy or even if you are just a casual fan of the movie then you totally have to get this. I eagerly await Hellboy: Blood and Iron, due out this summer. In the meantime, I reckon I ought to get me some Hellboy comic-books.

And if he makes it home, he must face two ancient gods ready to destroy the world. But hey, nothing's ever easy.

Fans of Mike Mignola's comics or the recent Hellboy movie will love this adventure. True it doesn't use Mignola's distinctive art style, but it maintains a look that is distinctively 'Hellboy' while at the same time being much easier to animate. Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones return to voice their movie roles, and seasoned vets Peri Gilpin, John Hurt, and Phil LaMarr carry the supporting characters. Perlman again proves he is the only choice for Hellboy, and his deadpan delivery is amusing in itself as well as emphasizing some of Hellboy's actions.

This dvd is fully loaded. Lots of featurettes, audio commentary, and footage taken from the panel at the San Diego comic-con. With the first release, Hellboy blows away all previous DTV efforts from Disney, Marvel, and Warner Bros.

Also, this story seems to be loosely based off one of the hellboy comics (you all remember the flying heads, right?). The last thing you have to know is this is officially NON-CANON. Mignola (though involved) wanted this project to be differentiated from *his* hellboy, hence the more-traditional cartoon style. The big upside to this is all the actors from the hellboy movie (ron perlman, selma blair, et al.) do the voices for their characters in the film. The downside is the story didn't translate into an hour-long show very well, so its kinda plodding and dull in places. I still recommend it though, especially if you can get your hands on one of the versions that came packaged with a small graphic novel (also non-canon, but fun).

2692062,3,B000KJTFEI,"I love Hellboy and Mike Mignola's work in general so I was pretty excited to check out Hellboy Animated. I knew going in that the people behind the film were going with a different look and feel from the comics, as requested by Mignola. This didn't bother me because they had great designers like Sean ""Cheeks"" Galloway working on the project bringing a sharp new look to the characters. Sadly, the animation sucked the life out of the design work and really bored me. It was stiff and looked like a Saturday-morning cartoon. I think a character as cool as Hellboy deserves a better looking animated incarnation than this.

The voice acting was very good, once again only weakened by the animation.

The extras were actually my favorite part of the DVD. There are some nice features on how Mike Mignola created Hellboy and discussions with Sean Galloway on re-designing the characters for animation, among other things.

All in all, I think it's worth checking out but it could have been much better.",1171411200,5,1000,4.76878612716763
2692063,2,B000KJTFEI,"I gave this more than just one star because I was able to watch it all the way through once.  But that's about it...  The plot and dialogue are pretty good; I never read the comic series, but loved the live action version, and this seemed true to the spirit of that one.

But I'll never watch it again, because I just don't understand how in 2007 a cartoon can be released with worse art and animation than Looney Tunes was capable of in the 1940's.  Worse even than most anime (oooh, harsh, but true).  Think ""Steamboat Willie"" in color.",1171238400,5,538,4.34

8157321,3,B000KJTFEI,"It's a good story. It's animated in a kinda Kim Possible way which makes it seem worse than it is. There isn't any gore or any ""lose all hope"" moments like in the comics. I enjoyed it and it's got some good jokes and action.",1466035200,,224,4.0

8157326,5,B000KJTFEI,"Hellboy Animated: Sword Of Storms is a really fun little movie based on the comic book series by Mike Mignola. The film features the voices of Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones. In the film, Hellboy must solve a case involving a Japanese sword, and he must trap 2 demons in the sword in order to save the world.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's basically a 77 minute Saturday Morning cartoon episode. It reminds me a lot of the kind of cartoons I grew up watching in the 90's and 2000's. It's a fun little animated adventure, and I highly recommend it.",1441670400,,560,4.333333333333333
