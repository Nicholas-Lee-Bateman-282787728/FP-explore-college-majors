2477858,1,B000E0VNQQ,"Of course fabulous ballerina--Maya is the greatest.  However, the pieces filmed for this video are  kind of filmy and hollywoodish.  My major beef is that the conversations are in Russian with no English sub-titles.",1202947200,,215,5.264705882352941
2477859,5,B000E0VNQQ,"This DVD about the dance legend is beautiful to watch, especially the interview with this still beautiful woman and how she feels about dancing.  She lives through dancing and she makes dancing live, as only a handful of people can do.  It is fortunate we have a record of this piece of ballet history.",1150761600,18,302,4.574074074074074
2477860,4,B000E0VNQQ,"This newly released DVD has 12 selections danced by this genius of the 20th centry ballet, 9 of which have been available on two other DVDs for a while.
6 of these selections are taken from a marvelous black-and-white, 70-minute documentary film originally released in 1964 with the title ""Maya Plisetskaya"", then released on DVD format in 2003 with the title ""Plisetskaya Dances"". The excerpts are from the ballets:
1) Romeo and Juliet.
2) Swan Lake.
3) Don Quixote.
4) The Dying Swan.
5) Laurencia.
6) Walpurgis Night.
The other 3 selections are from a 1973 color movie, released on DVD not long ago with the title ""Carmen Suite"":
7) Carmen
8) Prelude (Bach).
9) Raymonda.
The only new releases on DVD format that we can find in ""Maya Plisetskaya, Diva of Dance"" are the following 3 selections:
10) Spartacus: the pas de deux, a color take which is obviously not from the 1964 film.
11) Isadora.
12) Bolero de Ravel.
For those who already have the other 2 DVDs, this ""new"" DVD is worthy only for the last 2 excerpts, ""Isadora"" and ""Bolero"", and for the second half of the DVD, which brings ""Maya Plisetskaya in Conversation"", a recently recorded documentary in which the diva and her husband, the composer Rodion Schedrin, talk about her long career.",1140739200,93,1252,4.747706422018348

2477911,5,B000E0VNQQ,"This is surely one of the finest ballet DVDs Ive ever watched. Her interpretation of Bolero is stunning. I have watched it again and
again and found recently to my dismay that my copy had a crack
 in it and could no longer be played.  I am delighted to have been able to get a new copy of this wonderful DVD.  Maya Plisetskaya
is/was the finest ballet dancer ever.  If you have never seen her, I urge you to get this DVD - if you love ballet you will
adore this DVD.  Mike Woollam in South Africa.
PS then read up as much as you can about this incredible woman",1435276800,,560,4.054545454545455
2477912,3,B000E0VNQQ,"None of the dialogue is translated from the Russian which did not bother me as
these interviews with Plisetskaya have appeared in other DVDs with translation.
It appears to have been put together in a hurry and some of the filming is scratchy
or blurred and it has a few highlights that do not appear on other DVDs.  For the
most part ... enjoyable but much of it is repetition of what has appeared elsewhere.",1431993600,,409,4.453333333333333

2477914,4,B000E0VNQQ,"It has been known to me for MANY YEARS of the greatness of Maya Plisetskaya - but to see her in some of her outstanding successes was wonderful!!
And the interviews with both her & her husband, were fascinating!
A wonderful DVD!",1393286400,2,228,4.4523809523809526
2477915,5,B000E0VNQQ,"This a stunning documentary.  Ms. Plisetskaya's rendition of Bejart's ""Bolero"" by
Ravel is so powerful.  It gives me goosebumps...dance and artistry unsurpassed.",1381104000,,161,6.2727272727272725
2477916,3,B000E0VNQQ,It did not seem to me that the selections were the best of her performances.  Some pieces were not videoed from the best perspective.  The beauty was lost.,1377561600,,155,4.5
2477917,4,B000E0VNQQ,"ONE OF THE FINEST COMPILATIONS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST PRIMA BALLERINAS TO COME OUT OF RUSSIA.EARLY CLIPS IN BLACK AND WHITE ARE TO BE EXPECTED.

2477918,5,B000E0VNQQ,I love Maya Plisetskaya dancing. The most striking performance in this DVD from my point of view is Don Quixote. It seems as she comes to your seat and grabs you by the tie (if I was wearing one). Superb.,1283126400,3,204,4.125
2477919,5,B000E0VNQQ,"Just the picture on the cover of the booklet accompanying this DVD is almost worth it's cost. If not, then her 20 minute ballet of ""Bolero"" certainly is.

Be advised that one reviewer incorrectly stated the Russian language interviews of her and her husband Rodion Shchedrin have no English subtitles. The subtitles are accessible from the main menu, and most likely, from the DVD player remote control.

There are many things about this DVD that make it 5 star quality. Two are listed in my first sentence. Another is the rarity of any recordings of this remarkable ballerina who has been awarded the very highest honors by a fairly stingy Russian hierarchy. One, Prima Ballerina Assoluta among others. I guarantee you won't be able to keep from smiling along with her as she reminisces on some of her happier remembrances, and you might tear up with her as she describes an occasion when she was invited by actor Jean Vilar to dance at a ballet festival in France, and during the performance it was announced that Jean Vilar had died suddenly. She tells us that her ""Dying Swan"" ballet was being dedicated to him. The event was outdoors and during her dance it began to rain. She was soaked, the audience was getting soaked, her tutu was sagging, and she said, ""It was as if tears were falling from the sky"". She doesn't know exactly how many times she has danced ""The dying Swan"", but thinks it would be 20,000 to 30,000 times. Think about that.

I admire Maya Plisetskaya. When she hummed the tune from Raymonda, I had to get it out to watch the entire ballet. It didn't star Maya, but it starred a contemporary of hers, Irina Kolpakova, whom Maya mentions in her autobiography. Even though this DVD has dances repeated on other ""Maya"" DVDs it is worth having.......Richard.",1258329600,11,1778,4.6923076923076925
