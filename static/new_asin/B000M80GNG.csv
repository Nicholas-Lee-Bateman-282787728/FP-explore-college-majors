8167019,4,B000M80GNG,"A powerful and thoughtful made for television movie with insight into the often neglected survivors of a loved one's suicide. Explores the aftermath of the survivor's grief, anguish, anger, confusion and deep hurt left by the suicide of someone close to them. Also illustrates some of the day to day pragmatic obstacles and callousness show toward survivors by insurance companies, banks, employers and other institutions.
Also explored is the especially poignant and emotional trauma and bewilderment suddenly thrust upon a devoted wife and teenage son. Most of all, their question is: Why?? All in all, an important movie, well made, on a subject rarely ever touched upon. Highly recommended. Should be seen by many more viewers.",1283472000,,731,5.310344827586207
