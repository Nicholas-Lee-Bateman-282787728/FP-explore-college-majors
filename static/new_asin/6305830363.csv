7895967,2,6305830363,"Not really a ""movie"", but a series of a couple of different short-film episodes with different themes and tales of vampires. It was ok...I wouldn't rent it again though.",1111104000,,169,4.862068965517241
7895968,1,6305830363,"I'd rather get my story ideas from sixth graders than from the sorry bunch that wrote these tasteless, unimaginative episodes. This is the industry at its average -- slightly better than reality plant shows.
If this is the kind of stuff that turns you on, you should up your dosage of Prozac.
I could have written better stuff. And chances are, you could too.",1078617600,,359,4.625
7895969,4,6305830363,"This is a collection of episodes from the Showtime show ""The Hunger"" by Ridley Scott.  Each of these episodes about vampires is introduced by Terrence Stamp.  They are based on stories by horror writers such as Brian Lumley and Ron Dee.
In Fly By Night we see an unusual vampire.  The vampire and a woman suffering shell-shock are locked up in a hospital's padded room.  She recognizes the vampire for what he is and tries to help him, hoping he can help her.  A little confusing (how did everyone die in the flashback?).
A Matter of Style has a young man discover that he is a vampire.  He is assigned a mentor who tries to teach him the ropes (shape-changing, killing and even sex).  A fun story.
Necros is another different type of vampire.  A man falls for a beautiful woman who is in the company of an old man that some call Necros.  Some say his is a vampire while others claim he is the devil himself.  A strange tale but with a major hole (what happened to the earlier disappearances?).
Footsteps is an arty tale of a woman plagued by her nature to kill and those who always seem to track her down (it is not clear if she is vampire, werewolf, or something else).  But in Paris she meets a strange man who may be able to redirect her future.
As this is a Showtime show, there is plenty of nudity and sex so these tales are not suitable for all.",1067212800,14,1352,4.283464566929134
7895970,4,6305830363,"This is not the vampire movie with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve, but rather a collection of 4 episodes from the 1997-1998 and 1999-2000 Showtime series ""The Hunger"".
Produced by Ridley Scott (of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" fame) and his brother Tony, and hosted by Terence Stamp in the 1st season and David Bowie in the 2nd, the series was always well-filmed and produced but somewhat hit-or-miss in its scripts and acting. Nudity is a staple.
The Vampires DVD is the best of the four I own. It features the following episodes:
1) Fly By Night - wild man black vampire helps a woman trapped in a padded cell in his own demonic way
2) A Matter of Style - stars Chad Lowe as a virgin vampire whose mentor, Carmilla, teaches him the ropes
3) Necros - William Cobb is on vacation when he catches a glimpse of Helma, a breathtaking creature who captures his imagination. She has a companion, a frail old man who, according to folk law, is Necros, a dead thing that feeds upon the living. Should Cobb pursues his desires or heed the warnings of the town folk? A night of unbridled passion reveals the terrifing truth. Directed by ""Highlander""s Russell Mulcahy from a story by Brian Lumley.
4) Footsteps - Claire is a beautiful woman who travels the world attempting to save her voracious appetite for gourmet food and the men to dine with her. She devours food and lovers all over Europe until in Paris, she meets Patrick, a vegetarian, who challenges her to her very core. How can the ultimate carnivore build a relationship with a quintessential vegetarian? From a story by Harlan Ellison.",1029110400,22,1605,4.6749116607773855
7895971,3,6305830363,"I'm a big fan of the genre and so bought this DVD on the strength of the title.
A collection of short 'vampire' stories I thought the first very erotic, until it's untimely end.
One of the stories deals with a vampire who in the throes of passion developes not only a tail, but a very long tongue which she uses to drain her lover's life-force. Very strange, but still rather sexy - but pointless - she is collecting near mummified men for her partner's bridge games !?! (I kid you not!)
A mixed bag of some interesting some erotic, but still all over I think this is worth missing.",1029110400,7,582,4.3
7895972,5,6305830363,"Ok - no Bowie here, this is not the movie!  This disc is a collection of four 25 min episodes of first season of The Hunger.  Terence Stamp is the host this season, with short cameos at the start and end to frame the story, same format as Twilight Zone/Hitchcock presents/Outer Limits etc.
As well as Stamp being *wonderful* to watch, the stories are a lot of fun - more ... than horror & fangs, but tightly told and some very fine performances from the actors.  The production (from ""Scott Free Productions"", that would be Ridley & Tony to you) is classy - very easy on the eye throughout.  Bon appetite!",1010880000,7,605,4.423423423423423
7895973,2,6305830363,"first let me say that THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE WITH DAVID BOWIE.
but i knew that when i bought it. Showtime has/had a horror series, much like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt, called the Hunger. they got Bowie to host a few episodes. this is a collection of four ""vampire"" episodes from the show.
i use the term ""vampire"" loosely. most of them are not your typical vampires. you see NO fangs, almost no blood, and only one scene in which a vampire takes blood. you DO see a lot of sex.",974160000,22,488,4.147368421052631
