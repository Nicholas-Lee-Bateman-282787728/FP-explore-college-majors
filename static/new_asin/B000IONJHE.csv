2661304,3,B000IONJHE,"Three stars on my scale means an average movie that you wouldn't regret paying for at the cinema.

That said, this is a classic horror movie and was well made for its time. In our age of CGI and digital effects, it's very easy to dismiss older films as being ""hokey"" or ""unrealistic,"" but there is also something visceral to them. American Werewolf in London is one of those films that has enough corny sensibility that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time portraying some good horror tropes in emotionally evocative ways. You can watch this one for just good, classic, horror fun or you can pay a little more attention and see the personal horror of the main character, David, as he is confronted with the reality of being a monster. The first transformation scene is one of my all time favorites in werewolf cinema, as it is sudden, confusing, and ultimately horrifying for the character himself, even if modern audiences might get a chuckle or two out of the effects. The makeup and costuming are actually quite well crafted and it's worth noting while you watch that absolutely none of this was done with computers. What you see is painstaking time and attention spent on creating an illusion with actual, material, costuming and make up effects.

This is definitely a film worth keeping in your collection if you like horror. Maybe best avoided if you're not keen on blood and gore.",1515196800,,1410,4.704453441295547
2661305,4,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf in London (1981) is a classic horror film and monster movie. It is a tragic tale of man who gets the werewolf curse while visiting the beautiful English country side in London, England and gets attacked and bitten by a werewolf, because he travelled off the road and was lost in the woods and didn`t know a monster lived there. The werewolf transformation scene is very realistic and impressive and looks like the character is going through a lot of psychological and physical torture ! There is a lot of dream sequences that are pure evil and is in the imagination of the David character warning him of the dangers to come. And also his dead friend telling him that he will transform into a werewolf. Unless he ends the werewolf curse by killing himself . He also gets into a romantic relationship with a nurse who doesn`t know when the moon is full he transforms into a massive, powerful, ferocious werewolf beast with the strength of an elephant and powerful jaws and sharp teeth. !",1513814400,,1006,4.625698324022347

2661329,5,B000IONJHE,"<<SPOILER ALERT!>> AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981) stars David Naughton as David Kessler, who, along w/ his friend, Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne), is backpacking through northern England. Their vacation takes a detour into terror, when the two are attacked by a creature of the night. Jack is mutilated, and David is wounded. After waking up in the hospital, David's life becomes a supernatural nightmare. His dreams become increasingly feral and bizarre. At times, David has a difficult time distinguishing between dream and reality. In fact, the dream sequences are very inventive and well used. When Jack begins haunting David, he learns about what really happened to them. Jenny Agutter is great as David's nurse, Alex Price, who takes a personal interest in his case. Everyone remembers the ""dream within a dream"" and ""transformation"" scenes. While David's transformation scene is indeed impressive, it's not the only instance of brilliant special effects. Jack's slowly-rotting appearance is a prosthetic wonder! Lovers of horror / comedy films should be ecstatic over this one! Music is used perfectly as well. An all around masterpiece of its genre.

While in hospital for his bite recovery, a nurse (Jenny Aggutter of ""Logan's Run"" fame) takes a special interest in him and takes him home like a stray. So is he a bit unbalanced or does he have a nocturnal apatite that includes a lot of dumb people?

There is lots of great and not so great music with a moon motif in the background.

The DVD set comes with tons of extras, starting with ""Rick Baker - I Walked With A Werewolf"", 7:20. We get to see this epic, cool dude. But it's a bit too adulatory, and not so interesting. ""Making An American Werewolf In London"", 5:20, we find out that Baker did the Star Wars cantina scene, and that John Landis himself did some of the stunts, like smashing through plate glass in the Picadilly Circus scene. ""Interview With John Landis"", 18:20, we find out that he wrote the screenplay while in Yugoslavia doing Kelly's Heroes with Clint Eastwood and an ensemble cast. His driver Sacha, who is ""probably up in front of the war crimes tribunals"", met a gang of gypsies at a crossroads burying a man deep, feet first, with garlands of rosaries. Noted that the screenplay seemed to earlier reviewers to be ""too funny to be scary and too scary to be funny."" The dream within a dream is a reference to ""Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"", where people kept waking up. Landis calls the transformation a stiff-e metaphor."" ""Rick Baker on An American Werewolf In London."" He mentioned they had a long time to think about the screenplay since they made Schlock together. We see some unused wolf footage - we never get to see the rear end of the wolf. They made change-o-hands and change-o-heads, and when the scene was shown people stood up and cheered! ""All right, this is why we did that"" they said to each other, reflecting on months of hard work for just a few seconds of film. But Landis wanted the creature to be more of a mystery right up to the end. Rick Baker got the first-ever ""Best Make-up"" Academy Award. ""Casting Of The Hand"", 11:00, literally just that, very boring. Chopped up. Cool shots of Rick Baker's shop. ""Outtakes"", 3:00. Applying fake blood, rolling head scene, ""Story boards"" 2:30, comparison of over 20 story boards from the Picadilly Circus scene. ""Photography montage"", 3:40, totally nutso naked pics montage.

Disc 2 has ""Beware The Moon: Remembering An American Werewolf In London."" ""From the director of Animal House - a different type of animal."" Talks about how primitive 1969 Yugoslavia was, with its superstitions - ""the same year we put a man on the moon."" Got the green light to do the film, finally, after making three successful films - The Kentucky Fried Movie, Animal House, Blues Brothers. Talks about the Black Swan in Surrey, aka The Slaughtered Lamb. ""Beware the moon, eh"" he says as if he were Canadian (lame). Two leads talk - Griffin Dunne did not even audition. ""Are you claustrophobic?"" Landis family friend Jenny Agutter, the stunning nurse, talks. The wolf howl is an elephant and a wolf howl played backwards. Very cold in the moors scene. Griffin Dunne was depressed to find that he had to wear full body make-up. ""It was like being eaten alive by ants."" Body hair shot was done in reverse: they made him up in full, and removed it slowly - coarse hair to light hair. Elmer Bernstein's score was lightly-used in film. Cat Stevens didn't want his ""Moon Shadow"" used in the film, nor Bob Dylan for his ""Blue Moon"", so Sam Cooke's is used three times. Interviewed Michael Carte, the Gerald Bringsley character. Steadicam scene! Shot some scenes to slip into the movie theatre scene. Funny anecdote about a miscommunication over throwing the decapitated head onto the car ""hood"" or the car ""bonnet"". Discuss the Picadilly Circus scene - live and on set. Censors were more concerned about the nudity than the violence.

2661360,4,B000IONJHE,"Released in 1981 and written & directed by John Landis, An American Werewolf in London details events when two American male college students (David Naughton & Griffin Dunne) hike through the moors of northern England where they're attacked by a ferocious werewolf under the full moon. One wakes up in a hospital three weeks later wherein he starts a relationship with a nurse (Jenny Agutter). Will he become a werewolf? John Woodvine plays a doctor who takes interest in the case.

There were three major-release werewolf films in 1981: The Howling was the first and arguably the best, debuting in April, while Wolfen came out on in July and wasn't really a werewolf film, but rather a thinking persons nature-runs-amok flick. An American Werewolf came last, released in August, and was easily the most successful at the box office, making three times its cost in the US alone and 6 times worldwide. Yet, The Howling was more successful if you go by profit in comparison to cost, as it was surprisingly low-budget for a major release. ""Wolfen"" was, by far, the most expensive; and flopped.

""American Werewolf quickly garnered a cult following and I can see why. I usually don't like horror mixed with comedy, but this movie does it expertly; its consistently thrilling, gory, colorful, quirky and amusing. The transformation scenes hold up, as they depict the excruciating process. Moreover, its interesting seeing life in London in 1980 (when it was shot). Unfortunately, while Agutter is comely, not enough is done with her; and theres a curious hollowness to the movie, not to mention it ends in an awkwardly abrupt manner. Nevertheless, its well worth checking out if you're in the mode for a quick, entertaining horror/comedy fix. A stand-alone sequel came out in 1997, An American Werewolf in Paris.

A UK production, the picture runs 97 minutes and was shot in Powys, Wales (Hay Bluff, Crickadarn & Brecon Beacons) and England (London, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire & Middlesex). The special makeup effects were done by the renowned Rick Baker.

2661364,3,B000IONJHE,"Creepy yet occasionally amusing movie finds two American backpackers wandering around the North York Moors (after the curfew, no less) and getting savagely chewed up by a vicious attack dog of some kind--or so it seems. While one of the men doesn't fare so well, David (played by the likeable everyman David Naughton) ends up having dreams about the occurrence, and it soon becomes apparent that all is not going to be well when another full moon rises in the night sky.
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is not so much a traditional approach to werewolf cinema but is more so a modern day take on the theme of demonic possession (in the laidback audio commentary on this disc, actor Naughton explains that he actually had nightmares himself while playing this character!), featuring the case of a man whose physical and spiritual being is overtaken by a force beyond human comprehension. American-Jewish director Landis is both a kidder and a goofball (and there's a reason why directors of his ilk mainly make comedies...I suspect that it has something to do with having the last laugh, so to speak), but he doesn't try to hide this fact nor disguise it in his approach to film directing, and as a result AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF... feels like an attempt at a serious movie that its maker can't quite take all that seriously. But this is not to say that I dislike Landis himself, but this material leaves something to be desired for sure. While the film's makeup effects won an Oscar for the fascinating and knowledgeable artist Rick Baker, there is no doubt in my mind (after having carefully reviewed them both yet again) that the werewolf transformations in Joe Dante's THE HOWLING are the superior werewolf scenes captured on celluloid. Somewhat ironically, effects creator Rob Bottin (who did THE HOWLING at one studio, while Baker was hard at work on this picture) was an understudy of Baker's, and his transformation of the Eddie Quist character in THE HOWLING is the scariest werewolf transformation ever seen in a movie: while the Landis movie has a makeup job that revolves around far too many cut-aways, close-ups, and obvious changes, the Bottin transformations in THE HOWLING are all done in-camera (too) without having any noticeable edits in the film (witness the Eddie Quist transformation late in that film). And Bottin's effects were slow-building and equally well-lit--the transformation footage was not only eye-popping and highly detailed, but you could see it all happening right before your eyes and it was scary as hell to boot! But, if this movie proves anything, it's that sometimes the student is better than the teacher. And this is not to say that David's transformation isn't good. It's just that I disagree with others who have taken the party line claiming that this film has the better effects stuff. The cast are all very good in the film (the long suffering Griffin Dunne certainly deserves a nod, and the beautiful, tenderly sexy Jennifer Agutter is never anything to complain about), but other than that there isn't a whole lot of reason to recommend the movie. While I like all of the songs that Landis has chosen to put on the soundtrack, I disagree with their use in the movie. I think Landis was going for some type of effect that just didn't register for me, as I felt that the songs were quite out of place throughout the movie. And of course another major problem is that the movie really has no story (something that separates this one from THE HOWLING for sure) and while the characters are enjoyable, the picture really does need a narrative to propel it forwards (for some reason, American movies starting slacking off on the narrative imperative--as I call it--and this movie is the perfect illustration of what I'm talking about). The picture is also shockingly gory at times, featuring a lot of adult content and some unnecessary scenes of foreplay that might keep this one out of the hands of the kids who might enjoy the movie more than most adults even. Still, I do have to say that AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF... has many enjoyable scenes in it (including a few nightmare sequences that will really give first time viewers a jolt), and in some ways it is more entertaining than both THE HOWLING and 1981's other wolfy offering WOLFEN (by Wadleigh), but even for all of its great effects and actors one can't help but notice how all of these shocks and jokes are being used to hide the fact that the plot is really rather pointless. And, of course, since there is no story there is also no ending! Still, this is a fun and quite scary movie to watch around Halloween, with adult audiences primarily.
The ""Full Moon"" edition of the movie on DVD goes quite a long way towards giving you every detail behind the film's creation. There is, oddly enough, no audio commentary by Landis, but there is a breezy and amusing one by Naughton and Dunne, who talk about things that sometimes relate to the making of the movie and sometimes don't. But in general this is a fun listen. The ""Beware the Moon"" documentary (which comes on a separate disc) is hosted by filmmaker Paul Davis, who guides the viewer through the often tumultuous run that the picture had on its way to getting made, starting as it did on spec (composed by Landis back in 1969). This documentary does go in depth indeed, even though some things are repeated that you might have heard on the seven or eight brief extras included on the first disc.
If you are a stickler for a restored picture, I'd say go ahead and spring for this on Blu-Ray. But if you already own it on DVD, I don't think it's really worth it to upgrade. After all, a cleaner picture just helps you to see the film's many flaws, after all. C",1489017600,,5711,4.700598802395209

2661366,5,B000IONJHE,"This motion picture was the prototype of a new genre combining serious horror with strong comedic elements. It is of a standard well beyond the various ""Comedians Meet Monster"" flicks of the 1940s and 50s. Landis, as both writer and director, challenged the industry to rethink the stereotypical horror category in a new and highly creative form, including the musical score, staging and, especially, the outstanding makeup effects. ""An American Werewolf in London"" still stands today as the hallmark of its class.",1488412800,,514,5.280487804878049

There were scenes missing and, worst of all, the captioning was done by idiots who are afraid of ""dirty"" words. I do not want my movie edited and my captioning censored. It wasn't worth buying.

2661471,5,B000IONJHE,"A gruesome movie to watch when you are 10yrs or so in the early 80's and still stands up to the test of time.

In 1981, John Landis was (and still is) the King of Comedy. Animal House, Blues Brothers, 1941... The humor still percolates through this film as well as sets a new STANDARD for horror/ shocker films: Terminator, Nightmare On Elm Street, with it;'s gallows humor and; for the time, pretty amazing visual effects. Prodigious usage of ""Moon"" based songs to further carry the humor.

In many ways, this movie IS a comedy, as one would expect from Landis, but it is a horror film at it's heart. PTSD and ""survivor guilt"" while also developing into a monster. It's a pretty dark little film that ends up tackling some bigger issues and haunting the main character as he ends up becoming the creature he is warned about.

This movie comes about within a ""new age"" of film-making, where bigger risk is take with subject matter and pushes boundaries of what is considered to be ""obscene"" as well as acceptable. NOW, this film is considered to quite quaint and tame, but back in 1981... This was a very HARD R rated film. It is quite gory, features nudity and plenty of swearing. While other movies before it: Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday The 13th came before it, when one views this movie, you can see how it really ended up becoming  more influential to films like Terminator, Nightmare On Elm St and the horror genera in general.

As a 10yr old, I absolutely BEGGED my Grandmother and Step-Grandfather to see it... and I'm sure they cursed me since. There was a point where I did have to leave the theater; as I recall, it was The Uptown in Chicago on Broadway. While already shaken up by the first attack, I think I ""needed a moment"" when Griffin Dunne's character first visits David Naughton in the hospital.

Hey, it was 1981 and I was 10yrs old!

I still revisit the film because it is a classic and still grabs me to this day.",1482105600,,1948,4.4858757062146895

2661482,4,B000IONJHE,"To be clear, this isn't a very good movie. The pacing is slow and the story is, by now, very predictable. I gave this movie 4 stars because it edges over into the so-bad-its-good category. The gore and slightly hokey effects and horror scenes are all over-the-top, and I think the movie knows it - there're definitely some moments where it's making fun of itself. This saves it from being bad and makes it fun to watch, even if you know what's going to happen, and the werewolf effects, though a bit hokey, are pretty impressive for the time. Also, the zoo scene is priceless.

What a wonderful mix of humor, terror and love making that is believable enough to pull you into the story's horror and pathos at the same time you have a good laugh or two.  Scenes shot on the English moors are by themselves beautifully atmospheric and scary as heck without the need of CGI.  Makeup and transformations are superb.  I particularly liked the wit that went into the makeup job on the walking dead.  I won't give anymore away.  Just watch the film and see for yourself.",1478044800,,583,4.485714285714286

2661704,5,B000IONJHE,"It's admittedly dated in spots, but the makeup\transformation effects hold up remarkably well. Nowadays it would be all computerized and would lack the same feel and realism and would make them look like something from the Twilight series. Lots of trademarks that you can expect if you're familiar with John Landis films: humor, music, and macabre. An interesting addition to the werewolf mythology, and the beautiful and classy Jenny Agutter is never a bad thing either.",1475539200,,471,5.2105263157894735

It is an older movie so they probably didn't have the technology thats available today and we are all spoiled by that. There was absolutely no chemistry between David Naughton and Jenny Aguter.

2661734,2,B000IONJHE,"Not funny enough to be a comedy, not scary enough to be horror, and not smart enough to be satire. This was supposed to hold a mirror up to the horror genre, but instead was so sure of itself that I could not get in to it. The main character is an 18-going-on-40-year-old who becomes a werewolf while traveling with his friend in Wales. He is haunted by his friend who was murdered in a 20 minute fever dream marathon before he transforms.

The movie is celebrated for its makeup and puppeteering effects, but even those are hit and miss. The werewolf transformations are probably some of the best done, but his friend's final ""decomposed"" form is very much a Sesame Street-like Muppet effect. The movie could have cut out about 40 minutes and would have felt better and scarier.

This is great for those who appreciate old school FX, and those who want a scary movie that won't actually freak you out too badly.",1472515200,,912,4.5212121212121215

2661846,5,B000IONJHE,"As an avid horror fan, I don't know why it's taken me so long to get around to watching this movie, but oh man am I glad I did.

This movie dabbles in three genres: comedy, horror, and tragedy. It's a comedy first and foremost, and the horror aspects don't really ramp up until the very end (same with the tragedy). More than that though, it focuses on a traumatized man trying to come to grips with himself as he wonders if his sanity is crumbling. Since this is a horror-comedy, I never expected it to delve into the psychological ramifications of coming to grips with being a werewolf (a mindless rampaging beast in this instance, not the romantic Underworld/Twilight type of werewolf). It even shows just how utterly painful it would be to undergo a transformation that physically changes your body to such a large degree.

The writing itself is unusual. Not in a bad way, mind you. It just surprised me that John Landis wrote this, when the humor is very British. Then again, he has spent plenty of time abroad, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's able to convey both British and American humor styles. The actors themselves all do a fine job, but the fact that Jenny Agutter plays a lead role really makes me happy. I've had a small crush on her ever since I saw her in Logan's Run. If nothing else, watch the movie for her, because she's wonderful.",1463356800,,1357,4.489878542510121

2661853,1,B000IONJHE,"This review does NOT show any negativity towards the film, as it's one of my personal favorites. The Problem however lies within the blu-ray.

When this film was originally released in 1981, the entire soundtrack was Mono. The VHS was Stereo, which is fine, but the picture quality was horrible, although the full screen version does appear to show more of the picture. My guess is that the movie was shot in full screen, then cropped to widescreen for theaters. Anyway, the movie first made it onto DVD in the late 90s with poor color balancing on the video (a minor complaint). The audio had been upped to 5.1 surround, which seems unnecessary, but it wasn't until the 2005 DVD that problems arose.

On the 2005 DVD, the audio was altered to sound more modern (I guess...). What does this mean? Well, first the entire soundtrack was pitched down. This is a decision I really don't understand. Not only that, but the film was in 5.1 surround AGAIN, only it sounded more compressed! And worst of all, in true George Lucas fashion, sound effects were ADDED over the original audio.

As we all know, towards the beginning of the film, the boys get attacked by a werewolf. In the 2005 version, several growling sounds were added that were NOT present in the original film. When the pub-goers shoot the creature, gunshot sound effects are added that again were not in the original. There were also several animal noises added at the beginning of the zoo scene, as well as a gooey sound added when the first victims bodies are discovered.

Now you'd think with a blu-ray, they'd release the original version. I guess nobody noticed the edits, so there was never any demand to do so. Unfortunately, both blu ray releases are identical to the 2005 DVD, just with better picture quality.

I'm all for enhancing a/v quality, but adding sounds and pitching down the soundtrack was a REALLY stupid idea. The sad thing is that not many people know about this, so they end up buying an altered version! I'm hoping for a blu-ray release in the near future that contains the UNALTERED Mono soundtrack from 1981, at least as an option. If you want to see this movie, I suggest the 90's DVD. It's cropped and the color is messed up, but it has the best audio.

C'mon Landis! Give us the original!",1462665600,,2279,4.614814814814815

Dunne, Naughton and Agutter and all the other actors did a superb job. The horror and comedy mixed very well and kudos to Landis for doing a excellent job. However one dark spot in the movie was the ending, while the movie could not have an happy ending, it could have had a bittersweet ending. Naughton knew he had to die and even though he was in a different frame of mind physically and mentally he did recognize Agutter but in the end he had to end it and he appeared to lunge at her to get the police to shoot him for it was his love for her and her love for him that ultimately would kill him as hinted earlier in the movie but the ending was cheesy because Landis could have allowed Naughton and Agutter to express their love before he passed and possibly got a chance to tug more on the heart strings.

It's a classic with a very simple but solid story, believable characters, amazing effects, some of which still look better than modern CGI and a really great sense of humor. I love that it doesn't ever have time to turn into an angst fest as some stories of this nature are want to do. The soundtrack's also pretty good without being anything too complicated- the same song is actually repeated three times in different styles but it just works so well I can't imagine it being any different. Overall an amazing film.",1455580800,,542,4.540816326530612

2662032,1,B000IONJHE,"Should not dump on a cult film, but that ""beep-beep-beep"" sound you hear right now is a dump truck backing up to a blank page.  I'm driving and it is full of ""don't watch"", ""save your money"" and ""stay clear of this movie.""  I wish I had not spent the time to watch this dead end, drawn out, full moon, campy, nonsense flick that seems like the script was not completed when they started shooting.  There is irony everywhere folks.  This movie features one full moon and my review feature one full star, or an I Hate It level review.  But, hey, now I've seen it.  If I'm at a cocktail party and some old fart references ""An American Werewolf in London"" I will be at-the-ready to let him know all about it.  But in the meantime, I should get a life.  This movie is ancient (1981).  At least Landis can say he's made a movie or two.  Better than me on that count.  But I'll stand my ground and stop counting stars at 'one' when it comes to this film.",1454544000,,947,4.176795580110498

But this doesn't take away from the overall AT ALL this is a fresh and funn take on a classic tale and I recommend to everyone to check it out NOW.

Usually it's like, ahhh, or noooo or eee eee eee! as they run around the set. In this movie, the protagonist stands up and yells, JESUS CHRIST! like he's on fire. Followed by tormented agony. Then there's that scene with vivid dream of the werewolves dressed as nazi's attacking people. Very scary. This bluray is a must-have for any horror fan!",1449360000,,472,4.564705882352941

AAWIL seems unable to decide whether or not it wants to be taken seriously.  This drastically reduces the suspense element of the film.  I also didn't buy into the love story.  To me, it seemed less than genuine.  Therefore, I found it difficult to really ""care"" for the characters and emotionally engage/invest in the film.  The special effects were great for its time and the there were a few good scares, but I considered only giving this one two stars.

It just wasn't fleshed out enough for me to get invested in what was happening. Spoilers: He get's bit, his friend gets killed, his dead friend turns up as a ghost to warn him about being a werewolf, he turns (transformation scene was disappointing after having it hyped up my entire life), he kills about 10 people (don't actually get to see a single one die), and then he turns one more time at the end just to get shot by cops. And that's just the interesting bits. Everything in between those scenes was just... boring.

It was also filmed on location in England and the finale in Piccadilly Circus is awesome.  It also ushered in the newest in special effects that were entirely physical at that time.  And still gives the new digital effects a run for their money.  5 stars.  100%.",1440028800,,414,4.44
2662285,4,B000IONJHE,"In past reviews, I have wailed about the deleterious effect that some (not ALL) low-budget 80's horror movies had on the movie industry. We saw some of this influence re-emerge in the early 2000's with all of the wobbly zombie movies shot by college kids using Digicams they bought for cheap at Best Buy and Circuit City.

So here we have a big budget 80s horror flick. It seems that large studios finally woke up to the fact that these semi-amateur film-makers were making tons of dough and that horror films--like horror fiction--had become an industry.

I agree with the millions of reviewers who have noted that the balance between scares and laughs in this movie is not always successful. I understand Landis's comments about how this movie is a horror movie, not a comedy movie. He explains that, in modern times if a werewolf were to appear, people's reactions would seem comic because they can't accept what is happening right in front of their eyes.

Nonetheless, the movie becomes relentlessly brutal in its last 15 minutes--too brutal, I think. Cars crash and crush each other like soda cans; innocent bystanders get slaughtered--like lambs (ha ha)--in the most gruesome and beastly manner possible. Maybe this is Landis's idea of a wake-up call for all of the obtuse, class-conscious Brits in the movie. Reality is staring them in the face and they can't ignore it any longer.

Regardless of what you make of the horror vs. comedy debate, American Werewolf remains important and influential for those wonderful Rick Baker make-up effects. Landis gets some of the credit for those effects, too. His decision as a director to have a complete transformation under warm, bright lighting with no camera lens tricks was a good one. Sure, Baker's innovations with make-up effects are ultimately the star of the movie, but Landis also has to take some credit. These kinds of effects had never been done before, and I'm sure studio execs were constantly looking over Landis's shoulder wondering what the hell he and his crew were doing.

This new digital remastering looks good, not great. The extras are worth the price if American Werewolf is one of your favorite movies.",1440028800,,2176,4.918256130790191
2662286,3,B000IONJHE,"Okay I'm as surprised as anyone that I'm giving this only 3 but I need to be honest and in my (just my opinion) this film has aged a little bit compared to The Howling which still holds up. The main culprit is the story which is pretty flimsy and some of the humor just leaves me cold (though a few jokes are spot on.) That's not take anything away from the iconic transformation sequence which is still worth the price of admission even today. Also David Naughton, while a fine actor, doesn't really hold your attention the way Bruce Campbell or Dee Wallace are able to, though admittedly he kills it in the zoo scene. Maybe I'm nitpicking but to me this film contains a lot of the laziness that John Landis became infamous for. In later movies like Beverly Hills Cop III it became impossible not to notice that there was something missing.",1440028800,,841,4.432258064516129

2662324,5,B000IONJHE,"Over the years An American Werewolf in London directed by John Landis has taken on a mythic status among horror aficionados for the landmark SFX transformation sequences that to this day remain quite ingenious. However, with a thirty plus year viewing interval under my belt it is amazing to see how much the genre has evolved to the capabilities of the technology available..

With no CGI on hand to affordably bolster the frequent lulls between the carnage, American Werewolf is for all intents and purposes a romantic comedy with fangs - a straight ahead (very verbose) story of infatuation between emerging lycanthrope David Naughton and his nurse, wonderfully played by Jenny Agutter of Logan's Run fame. In fact, between the knowing glances and love struck prattle, thirty of the ninety minute running time is consumed watching their impossible love develop - by today's horror standards this would be enough time to dismember an entire legion of the undead.

Also, judging by the 21st century horror rule book, An American Werewolf packs more suspense than scare - with a gore quotient that is truer to the early films of the genre than to any ghoulish bloodbath that could be digitally conjured today. However, all things considered, AW is an extremely well done period piece that is well worth your time and respect.

2662345,5,B000IONJHE,"AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON [1981 / 2014] [Full Moon Limited Edition Iconic Art SteelBook] [Blu-ray] From the Director of Animal House . . . Comes a Different Kind of Animal! A Full-Blooded Horror Film That Happens to have a Sharp Sense of Humour!

Re-discover one of the most gripping horror films of all-time with the cult classic AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. Blending the macabre with a wicked sense of humour, director John Landis (National Lampoon s Animal House) delivers a contemporary take on the classic werewolf tale in this story of two American tourists who, while traveling in London, find their lives changed forever when a vicious wolf attacks them during a full moon. Featuring ground-breaking, Academy Award winning make-up by Rick Baker [The Wolfman], this digitally re-mastered Full Moon Edition also includes the new feature-length documentary Beware the Moon.

FILM FACT: The film won the 1981 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and an Academy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Make-up. In the Piccadilly Circus sequence, the man hit by a car and thrown through a store window is John Landis himself. The end credits, which congratulate Prince Charles and Diana Spencer on their marriage, end with a promo card for Universal Studios urging viewers to ""Ask for Babs,"" a reference to National Lampoon's Animal House. Before David Naughton transformed into a beast, he served as the jovial pitchman for the Dr. Pepper adverts and director John Landis wife loved those spots, and she recommended her husband consider him for the werewolf role because of them.

Cast: David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, Joe Belcher, David Schofield, Brian Glover, Lila Kaye, Rik Mayall, Sean Baker, Paddy Ryan, Jenny Agutter, Anne-Marie Davies, John Woodvine, Frank Oz, Don McKillop, Paul Kember, Colin Fernandes, Albert Moses, Jim Henson (archive footage), Michele Brisigotti, Mark Fisher, Gordon Sterne, Paula Jacobs, Claudine Bowyer, Johanna Crayden, Nina Carter, Geoffrey Burridge, Cynthia Powell, Frank Singuineau, Will Leighton, Michael Carter, Elizabeth Bradley, Rufus Deakin, Lesley Ward, Alan Ford, Peter Ellis, Denise Stephens, Christine Hargreaves, Linzi Drew, Lucien Morgan, Gypsy Dave Cooper, Susan Spencer, Bob Babenia, Ken Sicklen, John Salthouse, Vic Armstrong (uncredited), Ryan Folsey (uncredited), John Landis (uncredited), James Payne (uncredited) and Terry Walsh (uncredited)

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Few films had blended horror and comedy as masterfully as AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON did back in 1981. London revolutionised special effects for that era. But the film works best as a study of a tortured soul. Our hero is forced to make an agonising choice, one made all the more difficult as the dead bodies pile up around him.

American pals David Kessler [David Naughton] and Jack Goodman [Griffin Dunne] are traveling through England when their vacation is cut short by a hungry wolf. The beast kills Jack Goodman and takes a bite out of David Kessler, who thinks he survived the assault with only a few scratches and one less friend. Unfortunately, nobody else does either. They think werewolves are old folk legends, and that you are merely suffering from post-traumatic stress, and they're probably right... right? For a while you think so. The doctors are probably right. There are no such things as werewolves. You're probably just going crazy. No such luck. But Jack Goodman comes back from the grave to tell him otherwise, especially as David Kessler will become a werewolf when the next full moon comes around, unless he kills himself before then. But David doesnt like that option, particularly since falling for the Nurse Alex Price [Jenny Agutter] who treated his injuries following the attack.

While relaxing in the new girlfriend Alex Price s apartment reading a book, you start convulsing in horrendous pain and starts morphing into a positively horrifying monster, created by make-up artist Rick Baker and others. And we see David Kessler go on a man eating rampage, terrorising the main city streets of London, and have no control over your horrendous outbursts.

AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON was a beneficiary of the growing trend to film in locations that might add to the experience of watching them. The chosen locale for John Landis' 1981 horror comedy was London Zoo which heralds the start of one of the film's few genuine comedy sequences as luckless student David Kessler [David Naughton] wakes up in the wolf pen and realises he needs to make it halfway across London without a thread of clothing to his name. The scene is very funny, especially seeing the character with his clothes off and especially seeing him reacting with the public, especially in the park and his journey back to Nurse Alex Price s [Jenny Agutter] flat via public transport.

London delivered state of the art (circa 1981) make-up effects from gore maestro Rick Baker, including the iconic transformation scene that s lost little of its visceral punch. And the film s saucy soundtrack, every great song with the word moon in the title gets a showcase, heightens the mood. But its Jacks occasional reappearances where the film s black humour truly pops. Griffin Dunnes wiseacre role makes the horror go down easier while illustrating Davids sad predicament. Writer and director John Landis, fresh from directing Animal House and The Blues Brothers, found just the right balance between horror and humour. AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON deserves its cult status, not only for its shock sequences, but also for the tiny moments, like David Naughton calling his family back home via the public phone box for what might be the very last time. Those touches make this werewolf story so very, very human.

In the end, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON successfully attempts to update the werewolf genre; there is no such thing as silver bullets or other silly plot points from previous werewolf films. This horror cult classic attempts to simplify the fact that it is very funny, but does not hinder the scary elements or the impact of the creature. Because what does the werewolf represent? It represents the idea of stripping someone of their humanity and leaving them at their most primal state: something that seemingly happens in everyday society. And that is why the darker tones of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON mix perfectly with comedy and horror, that at the time the critics hated it, but luckily it has now become a cult classic, which I endorse 100%.

So grab the popcorn, turn down the lights, grab some silver bullets, especially for protection, and get ready to watch the best horror flick of the 1980's has to offer! You'll never look at a full moon the same way again! A must see for the horror buffs and lovers of scary films and werewolves. Watch this film on this stunning new Full Moon Limited Edition Iconic Art SteelBook Blu-ray disc and scare yourself silly!

Blu-ray Video Quality  This ""Full Moon Edition"" has been digitally re-mastered with a good 1080p encoded image, that hasn't gone overboard with the DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] and has an impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio. However, it does sort of show a lot of signs of age, as there is some graining throughout. Much of the film features hazy skies, which are a lot thicker thanks to all of the grain. Grainy images are throughout the film, but that sort of adds to its creepy factor. Overall, colours are dim and dark, but there is some nice detail in spots, most notably inside the Slaughtered Lamb pub. David's nightmares are a bit more vivid, as are the images. The colours get a bit more of a boost here, if you can actually see in between the hands covering your eyes. Makeup master Rick Baker's handwork is also pretty detailed, including the pieces of flesh hanging off Dunne's corpse. The colours and contrast are excellent, probably of the standard that you'd have seen in cinemas in 1981 and the blood effects are bright, as well as the night time scenes are clear with good definition.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound on this Blu-ray disc comes off so much better, than previous releases, thanks to this release's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. With England most of the time, especially in this film, can be very rainy, so you can expect a host of weather-related sounds, including rain, thunder, and whipping winds aplenty. The best part, of course, is the howls, growls, and feasting of the werewolf, which seem to come at you from every angle. Some of those scary moments are loud; this I suspect is just to make sure you jump. But again the audio soundtrack is beautifully balanced with clear dialogue and excellent use of the surrounds making the werewolf attacks as terrifying as they can be; especially the scene in which Jack is killed really retains its power to shock with the blood, quick cutting and Griffin Dunne's superb performance pleading for his life. The soundtrack music by Elmer Bernstein is used sparingly but effectively with Bad Moon Rising by Credence Clearwater Revival and three different versions of Blue Moon really well placed.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Cast Members David Naughton and Griffin Dunne: Here we get the introduction from David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, where they inform us that they are in a recording studio in Burbank, California, and you hear Griffin Dunne ask David Naughton when was the last time he viewed this film, but tells us he couldn't remember when it was. They also tell us about their children and not at the time when they were younger in allowing them to see the film. They also inform us at the start of the film, that it was filmed in Wales, to represent the North of England and the Moors. An interesting fact comes to light, is that Griffin Dunne tells us that he never was asked to audition for the film, and had at the time, never done any actual film before, but when he met John Landis and spoke to him for about 10 minutes, John Landis immediately said, okay and got the part in the film. We also hear David Naughton inform us that reason he got the film because John Landis via his wife saw David in the Dr. Pepper adverts and liked what they saw. They also tell us that a lot of the time they improvised things up as they went along, as most of the time they did not stick to the script, which John Landis liked very much, plus it was a 10 week shoot. When John Woodvine appears as the doctor, we find out that originally it was going to be James Fox or Robert Stevens as the doctor. Because Griffin Dunne did not do much filming, most of the time decided to visit as many London Theatres plays as possible. But what Griffin Dunne was not so keen on was the horrible special effects make-up mask he had to wear, he said after 12 hours it felt like ants were eating his skin on his face and eventually had to rip the mask off, which did not very please Rick Baker. Both Parents of David Naughton and Griffin Dunne saw the film and were totally horrified what they viewed and were truly upset. When you see David Naughton turned into a werewolf, it took 6 days to shoot. Now even thought I have given you a lot of insight into David Naughton and Griffin Dunne audio commentary, there is a lot more fascinating information you get to hear from this dynamic duo, as there is a lot more naughty funny information to be heard I have not revealed and if you want to find out what that is, then I highly recommend you make an effort, as it is a well worth listen.

Special Feature: My Scene: The My Scene feature is available while the film is playing. For more information, please consult the instructions in the menu.

Special Feature Documentary: Beware the Moon: This is a really informative and fascinating insight on the making of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and what you get is 13 separate titled categories, which you can either play all of them in one go or play them separately and they are as follows: The Beginning [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [14:10]; The Cast [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [7:16]; Shooting in Wales [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [5:38]; Murders on the Moors [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [7:34]; What Bad Dreams Are Made Of [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [5:28]; Bringing Jack Back [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [4:24]; The Transformation of David [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [12:08]; The Music of American Werewolf [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [2:30]; Underground Filming [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [5:26]; Porno & Puppets [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [9:16]; A Four-Legged Hound from Hell [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [4:28]; Causing Disturbance in Piccadilly [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [7:19]; The Beast Unleashed [2009] [1080i/p] [1.78:1] [12:32].

Special Feature: I Walked With A Werewolf [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:30] Here we get a really personal view by Rick Baker [Monster Maker], especially on his journey to becoming a top notch professional Make-up Artist and tells how he was influenced by the old Classic Horror films from Universal Pictures, and their famous monsters, that were for him, well cool. When Rick Baker worked on the John Landis 1981 classic funny horror film, he wanted to see David Naughton transfer into a werewolf in a proper professional way, instead of the old fashioned dissolves that you use to see in the black-and-white Universal Pictures old gothic horror films. Rick Baker also informs us that he really loves his job, especially making things look realistic and would also do his job just for the love of it, even if he was not employed in the films. This is a really nice little feature and well worth viewing.

Special Original Feature: Behind the scenes: AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:15] This looks to me like an American Television A Made For TV type documentary and gives an in-depth look behind-the-scenes of the making of the 1981 film and we get a personal contribution from John Landis [Director] himself. But we also get lots of clips from the old black-and-white Universal Pictures horror films. Sadly, the film with John Landis was shot on 16mm film and most of the time it looked slightly out of focus. At the very end it mentions that a new film entitled The Werewolf is coming out and obviously a film Rick Baker has worked on.

Special Feature: Universal Studios Home Video presents John Landis on: An American Werewolf in London [2001] [480i/1080i] [1.33:1] [18:20] This again looks like another American Television A Made For TV type special and is a very nice intimate personal view from John Landis on the making of his 1981 film, and again we get lots of clips from old black-and-white Universal Pictures gothic horror films. This is a really nice presentation and well worth a view.

Special Feature: Make-up Artist Rick Baker on AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [11:14] This is again another personal view from Rick Baker on his work with the 1981 John Landis film and a lot of his views are basically repeated on what he said in the special I Walked with a Werewolf. We also again get lots of repeated clips from AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, as well as unused outtake footage. We are also informed at the very end, that Rick Baker received the first Academy Award in the category of Best Make-up for his work on AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.

Special Feature Archival Footage: Casting of the Hand with Rick Baker and Crew, David Naughton, and John Landis in October 11th, 1980 [480i] [1.33:1] [10:59] What you basically get to see is the long intimate insight into the process of building up the arm and hand, for false arm and hand for the special effect when David Naughton turns into a werewolf.

Special Feature: AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON Outtakes [Soundtrack Missing] [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:08] What you get to see in total 7 standard outtakes, but we get one extra out of the blue entitled Mystery Footage [soundtrack missing], which is a repeat from a previous extra, where you get to see John Landis sitting front of some scenery talking to the camera and then suddenly the scenery falls over him to reveal four naked couples romping on a bed. Although it says no soundtrack, what you do get is the sound of film going through a projector.

Special Feature: Storyboards [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:26] Here we get to view at the top of the screen the storyboard drawings with wording underneath explaining what the scene is and below it you get to view the actual part of the film relating to the storyboard, which eventually opens up showing you the actual part of the film, but you also get lots other clips from the film.

Special Feature: Photograph Montage [2009] [480i/1080i] [1.33:1] [3:45] Here you get to see lots of still photographs from the 1981 film. Some of them are in colour, but we also get to see lots of black-and-white still photographs. As you view this montage of photographs, in the background, you get the soundtrack music from the film.

Special Feature: D-BOX Motion Code: If you are equipped with a D-BOX integrated motion system, you will be able to experience a whole new dimension while watching the film.

Finally, I never get tired of watching AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and though there are some superb lycanthropic films around, this is by far my favourite comedy horror cult classic. This Full Moon Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray release has some really excellent Audio and Video quality presentations and a really fine and amazing array of brilliant extra features that will keep you busy for several hours. If you own the 25th Anniversary Edition, it's still worth upgrading for this improved Audio and Video package and with definitely more extras, especially the excellent Beware the Moon documentary, but if you don't already own this, it's as close to a 'must buy' as you can get and I doubt if there will be anymore Blu-ray releases in the near future, so grab this Blu-ray Edition, as once they have gone, that is it. Highly Recommended!

2662356,5,B000IONJHE,"Best werewolf movie EVER!  Plenty of scares, but also a lot of laughs, perfect for a sick sense of humor...greatest transformation into a werewolf EVER!!  Very few other horror movie has such good special effects, especially in the 80s!!",1431388800,,237,5.051282051282051
2662357,4,B000IONJHE,"The film has some very stereotypical aspects to it, the almost arrogant and foolish way that British intelligence is shown almost seems derogatory, as David must submit to foreign policies and beaurocracy. However the images of Londoners is mildly balanced and justified by the asinine shenanigans of David Kessler. The story is a funny and the negatives are minor unless youve seen the film like a thousand times and those idiosyncrasies are all that remain to pick at. The story stays with in a classic premise that does not rely on props or gimmicks of the time to find its humor which make it an easy film to watch no matter how many decades pass.

The special effects in this film are kick ass and organic. It is some of the best special effects make up work of the era. It kept with the basic concepts and abilities of creature effects , something that I am glad to see come back into fashion in horror. There are a few scenes in this film that really stand out as far as quality of FX. The rotting visuals are kick ass. Gross and gory and good. Plus I think this is the first time that we saw werewolves as massive beasts instead of the upright biped creature known in earlier stuff like The Wolfman. No need for a real wolf, the kind popular in today's shows and movies, nor is there any aspects of the standing monstrosity that is so terrifying such as in The Howling. This was a truly original design for the era. It made not only werewolves scary as hell beasts with almost no resemblance to man but it also made real wolves a bit more scary as well (for me anyway).",1431216000,,1577,4.382252559726963

Since childhood (I am 25 now) I have been a huge fan of the horror genre and particularly enjoy horror films from the 80s and prior. Years later I watched it again and I am absolutely blown away at how amazing the special effects were and how truly realistic they seem even by today's standards. Forget CGI, stop motion all the way! In fact, the special effects within this film were so groundbreaking and impressive it created the ""Best Makeup"" category within the Academy Awards. The cinematography is also eerily stunning. What with the English fog on dark moors and the werewolf's point-of-view camera shots it is truly an effective horror film. I do not want to blow away the plot (watch the film yourself) but I will say that the film also has comedy effects that blend in beautifully with horror which in itself is a phenomenal combination- like salted caramel but on screen. With great acting, an awesome story, and great combination of horror-comedy, American Werewolf in London is truly a gem of a film!",1428883200,,1246,4.542222222222223

The video wasn't ""enhanced"" for those picky enough, seems right from the video, but the film, story line, acting were all top notch, and the movie is fun. I'm a fan of dark humor and this was lighter than dark without being a full fledged comedy. And it's really nice to ""own"" the movie as I hate watching commercials of an edited movie. This also ""sounds good"" in that I can put it on, and enjoy it without having to be glued to the visual, and still be able to do my work around the house. It also works well with ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" for when I want to spend my day in the same vein of werewolves. The special effects were/are classic, and again, all parts played where one can't imagine anyone else in the roles. A good movie for any movie buff's collection. And just a thought...enhancement, 3D, Blue Ray wouldn't necessarily make this movie ""better"" as its own version stands by itself and has stood the test of time as a cult favorite.

2662415,3,B000IONJHE,"I really enjoy werewolf movies. Ive seen quite a few. Im not CRAZY addicted to them. I haven't seen all of them out there, but there are creature designs I like and of course ones I don't.

I saw this on AMC, and no offense to bigger horror fans than me, I didn't see this until fall of 2014. Okay now that you've said, ""WHAT?!?"" Ill say again, I'm not really a horror fan. I just like werewolves, and not even the scariest creatures. The Wolf-man (with Anthony Hopkins) is my favorite. Something about AWIL caught my eye. The comedy is great, and perfectly dry. Amidst all this bloodshed to have the lead characters dead friend coming back and bugging him all the time (yes AFTER he's killed) to sort of serve like a guide and to warn him is brilliant. The first night when the guys are being hunted by the creature with the howling in the distance is classic horror. I loved the first 20 mins, perfectly done.  The werewolf transformations are great and hold up against the 30+ year age of this movie. Nurse Alex (Jenny Agutter) is great, a beautiful actress, and I credit Griffin Dunne ...hes hysterical. Even as a full on corpse!

I was totally into this movie for nearly the whole thing until the end. Reasons? Here we go:

1. WAY to many scenes with David Naughtons butt, I mean the guy ends up naked A LOT, it almost became a point of comedy, male ass almost always means comedy
2. There is plot buildup and development and then the resolution is just sort of there
3. I felt John Woodvine was underused, his character was great, just underused
4, Its a very sexual movie, with one scene being in a porn theatre. So, this to me, just for me, didn't have any value
5. The ending is anti climatic, and very sudden.

So, I didn't hate it, didn't love it. It falls in that ""glad I saw a classic, and glad I own it"" category. Its just not one Id run back in a house on fire to save.",1421712000,,1884,4.266106442577031

I lived thru the 80's, and I know that film-making had a very, very long way to go at that time, and I do try not to measure older films by today's standards, but really...this is what people call awesome special effects? Seriously not. Horror? No, not in the least. Humor? I think not, aside from just being ridiculous. The acting is some of the absolute worst. Bit parts were played 200x better than most of the main characters. Especially the two American guys...their acting was mechanical and completely hollow.

The special effects are probably the only thing it has going for it.  There were many plotholes, but ""SPOILERS""  if you haven't already wasted time watching this, the main thing that took me out of this movie is the fact that after the boys were bitten and one dies, the other is placed into the hospital and is in a coma for days, the parents of the one that lives are seemingly not concerned at all about their son who was brutally attacked.  They do go to the funeral of the boy who was killed, but when they are called by their son, instead of being on the plane to England to make sure their son was OK, they are out to dinner or a party with friends. Really??? There are other things that could elaborate on, but that was the straw.....

Universal really did make the effort to clean this film up to make the picture quality more, crisp & sharper in 1:85:1 widescreen
and it Definitely shows, much better clearer picture than the old DVD release
plus the sound quality has been boosted to a new 5.1 master audio mix which sounds Great on my surround sound system

in regards to the special features
this FULL MOON BLU-RAY release is exactly the same as the 2 Disc DVD set released before
all the special features, every single one of the them has been carried over to this new blu-ray version
BEWARE THE MOON which is all new 90min Documentary on the making of the film
which has new current interviews with John Landis,Rick Baker & nearly all the Actors from the film, Great 90mins Documentary
I WALKED WITH A WEREWOLF which is a new Rick baker interview giving his recollections
on the special make-up effects in the film
MAKING AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON
the original TV promo featurette broadcasted when the film was seen in Theaters
casting of the Hand, Outtakes and lots more all on 1 blu-ray Disc, incredible
so forget the old DVD release get this all new blu-ray version worth the money for sure

Universal has also re-issued this blu-ray this year 2014 as a steelbook packaging with Different cover art
it's listed on amazon.com check it out
this steelbook is exactly the same as the 2009 blu-ray release, the picture quality & special features are the same
only Difference is Different packaging, this 2014 version is steelbook with Different cover art
the 2009 release is standard blu-ray case so up to you which one you want

This was the first DVD I bought it was the first bluray and one day when I can buy it digitally I will. Seriously amazon iTunes google play store why the F can't you buy this digitaly. I would spend around $40 just for a digital copy if you asked that much on top of owning it on charge DVD and bluray.

2662446,2,B000IONJHE,"Don't get me wrong.  ""An American Werewolf In London"" is a GREAT movie!  But repackaging a previous release and the only difference being that this new one is in a ""steel box"" is just greed at it's finest!  If you already own the 2009 ""Full Moon Edition"" then buying this is a BIG MISTAKE, because all of the special features from 2009 are just ported over to this edition.  There's nothing new here.  No new interviews, behind the scenes, or anything else.  So, if you already own the 2009 ""Full Moon Edition"" of ""An American Werewolf In London"", then you don't need this!  Universal should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this as a ""Limited Edition"".",1417824000,,659,4.629310344827586
2662447,4,B000IONJHE,"In a nutshell:
The subway scene where you see it walk up, stop and then look up...the quick but eternally long scene was burned into my childhood, and yes it still occasionally pops up in a rare-if-ever nightmare. ..but my dream self just laughs and tsk-tsk's at it......one of THE best movies ever made.",1417737600,,304,4.648148148148148

2662457,4,B000IONJHE,"One of the creepiest and best transformation scenes but other than that, it really is quite dated and not all that fun to watch.  The sequel ""...In Paris"" was at least a little bit goofy and made it more entertaining to watch.",1416787200,,226,4.380952380952381

2662459,5,B000IONJHE,"Besides boasting some of the best special effects of its time (the transformation sequence won an Oscar for FX makeup artist Rick Baker), An American Werewolf in London boasts a fun story and witty dialog that make the film a true delight. One of the few films to successfully mix comedy into terror, the film never has a dull moment. Landis both wrote and directed the picture, keeping it lively and horrifying at the same time. For horror movie buffs like myself, there are numerous nods to the old Universal Wolf Man films. The cast play their scenes well and are obviously having the time of their lives doing it. This may be as close to a perfect werewolf movie as we ever get. As it stands, it is at least a great guide to making a horror movie infused with a lot of fun.",1416614400,,777,4.36551724137931
2662460,4,B000IONJHE,"One of the best horror films of the 80s, it does have some flaws. An American Werewolf in London easily stands out for its remarkable achievements in make-up, the transformation sequence still unmatched to this day. The final puppet of the werewolf David looks organic, realistic, and fierce. One of the best lycanthropes ever put to film.
The first half of the movie is where it really shines. The atmospheric opening attack to the bizarre dream sequences in the hospital, the film is remarkably surreal, frightening, and laugh out loud funny at the same time.
My one major complaint would be that the climax of the film outside the theater is a bit rushed. The horrific car crash sequence is very well executed, and feels like the beginning of an exciting finale. Sadly, this sequence ends a short time later, and the film comes to an abrupt conclusion. It does hurt the film just a little, but does not dethrone it from its status as a classic. One of three wolf themed movies released that year, this one is still the best. Aside from its abrupt ending, it is still a treat and has aged very well. Check it out.",1416528000,,1115,4.58

2662532,5,B000IONJHE,"I'm telling ya...this was THEE cream of the crop, Werewolf movie, without a doubt. Far as horror goes, it was shocking as a kid in the 80's seeing this for the first time. And still has the same impact even as a grown man in 2014. The title alone, is more of a statement, than a mere movie title. There have been a few other pretty good wolf movies, that I remember from the 80's. But there is just something more special, and captivating in AAWIL that puts it in a league all its own. I kinda wish they would actually do this movie again, pick up where it left off, Alex crying the ally....then perhaps finds out she is pregnant with David's 'Half human, half wolf' baby. Thus the curse was never quite lifted, because the wolf blood line has been passed on to his son/daughter. I dunno, just spit ballin here. This movie KILLS, literally....and I mean that in a good way. Watch it. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you will probably rewind it a few times just to watch the transformation all over again.",1413331200,,999,4.376344086021505

This film is a classic.  Directed by John Landis, of Michael Jackson's Thriller fame, it's a horror comedy which certainly has both dark and light moments.  I would put this right up there with The Lost Boys, Fright Night, and The Goonies in the category of 1980s Halloween classics.",1413331200,,431,4.417721518987341

It was the first of its kind to show that werewolves were/are people with lives, and they were usually very likable people, too (not moody, grim and depressed folk like Lon Chaney, Jr.!) And also in its day, the special effects were pretty terrific. I just watched this for the first time in many years, and while the movie was still entertaining, it wasn't as great as I remembered it. I won't ever watch it again, but it's still a classic for its time. So far, my favorite werewolf movies are Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps.",1411430400,,576,4.443396226415095

2662628,1,B000IONJHE,""" .... I seriously don't known what all the hype is about. Give me a break ! Why everyone is thinking this is such a fantastic movie ? Special effects , maybe yes , but story line & plot , no. Never.  A movie coming from John Landis & nobody is expecting this to have some form of comedy elements in it ? I read in Wikipedia tonight that people ran or walked out or ""left"" the movie theater in terror because the movie was so scary for them that they couldn't or didn't finish watching the rest of the film. I watched this movie from beginning to end & found it to be spotty & checkered with the story plot being all over the place & lost in a sea of childish horror scenes , a romance in great part & detail as the movies leaning story line & plot & the so-called scary scenes are all filled with satirical lines that made no sense. Believe me , this was no horror film. One or 2 scary scenes only because they make you jump & not because of the special effects or makeup. Seems like a bunch of Sissy's have been watching this movie to be scared of it thinking it's a scary movie. The special effects by Rick Baker are fantastic , but something so infantile story-line-wise & it completely makes you lose sight that this movie is labeled as a Horror film for which it is not. In spirit it is a horror movie because it looks scary & has scary makeup & special effects , but it is not surprising at all that this is more of a joke than a real film. That Weird Al may have written it. I was all set in watching this movie for the very first time in my life here in 2014 as the movie was made back in 1981 & I find myself missing out on nothing should I never have seen this movie at all. The werewolf looked fake & the movie pretty much was relaxed , time consuming & very lackadaisical at most. I don't know what all the hype is about this being a very scary movie. It is not. The special effects won academy awards for the werewolf transformation segment & that is the only eye popping thing about the movie. Those who walked out of theater as described in Wikipedia's rendition of this movie being seen by those in opening weekend & walking out terrified are afraid of juvenile leveled horror movies like this that any child would disbelieve this film to be plausible in their innocent undeveloped minds to know when something looks poorly made. The movie was maybe 15 % scary. I am being generous. The rest of the movie dealt with looking for David Kessler , investigating , love making & too much time spent in the hospital & the story focused too much on the romance of David & his nurse , Alex Price. This is no horror movie. Maybe a made for TV horror movie mixed in with with very subtle horror & no real idea of where the movie is going. Those who ran out who thought this movie was terrifying to them , only stayed long enough to see what foolishly was scary scenes to them , but if they stuck around long enough to see the entire film , it is more deserving of a laugh than a strike of fear. Only the werewolf transformation was pretty good special effects-wise , but the other special effects done in the film was poorly done makeup-wise. The blood looked fake & when Jack was talking to David in the movie theater being only of skeletal formation , I knew I couldn't believe it as everyone knows , you need lips & a tongue to form the words for which Jack Goodman spoke. Skeletons don't have tongues or lips , so how could this Skeleton Jack guy speak as a dead skeleton without those 2 key elements for speech ? Yes , I know it's just a movie , but knowing as a dead person coming back in a skeletal form , that you don't have a tongue or lips distracts me from taking that scene serious at all & only if you don't need a tongue or lips to form words in real life , would I ever believe that skeletons could talk without a tongue or lips. Lol ! Everyone is talking more about how scary this movie is rather than how comical & juvenile this movie is actually. I was expecting this movie to be a serious hardcore knock your socks off horror movie , but with the likes of John Landis writing & directing it & knowing those who know of or have seen his movies before like Animal House & The Blue's Brother's before this film , shouldn't be expecting anything remotely great. John Landis is a comedy writer & should stay that way. Horror movies are not his forte'. I was really disappointed in how lacking the horror was in the movie as the film spent more time in the relationship of he & Alex Price , running around looking for David Kessler in London & or a lot of time spent doing everything else except showing us gore. Sure even a horror movie is deserving of a script & a story line , but I believe that it is just that. John Landis spent too much time on the comedy aspect of it than what we all would naturally consider a true consistency of horror , gore , macabre & disgust. This was none of it. Just a love story by a wide margin majority with too much heart & all the time got lost into the focus & development of the relationship between David & Alex. Not enough horror sequences. No focus even in the exceptional amount expected in regards to David as the werewolf. Very little was filmed or written in the movie with David portrayed & acting as the werewolf. I was mildly impressed , never scared & shook my head in disappointment. I expected more out of this film than all this falling in love stuff & drifted scenes away from the prime story plot which is the werewolf. The story was just everywhere all over the place & became useless. I don't know what all the hype is about other than the great special effects. Other than that , the story & plot stinks & was completely pointless. Not enough Horror to even minutely call it a Horror Movie. It is listed on my cable TV guide as a ""Horror Comedy"". Yes , I believe that is more fitting than the insult to the intelligence of real horror movies. This movie ,  to anyone , is more deserving of subtle laughs & occasional mellow dramatic intriguing impressive gore scenes to one's own mind than the overrated , excessively gloated & blown out of proportionate sheer terror everyone exaggerates about this movie. Stop making this movie into what it's not by trying to brag how great it is. It's not all that. It has it's moments , but it's not a good movie at all from beginning to end. For 1981 , the technology of the special effects used is so unconvincing , outdated & corny at best. John Landis is mediocre & marginally talented with special effects & is poor & remedial for someone who writes comedies & has no talent & no experience in making horror films. Stick with what you know & are good at , John ( Landis ). Comedies. Leave all the real horror movie making business to the real experienced professionals who know what real horror movies are & what scares us. Not all this un-scary , multi-tasking , here there & everywhere story lined movie this is & was. John Landis clearly does not know what scary is.
  ... I must also say that the 1980 film ""The Elephant Man"" was not directed by that of David Lynch. No sir. It was directed by Blazing Saddles director : Mel Brooks himself. Yes. Brooks felt that if he had given himself directorial credit or any part of his name being associated with such a masterpiece like The Elephant Man , people would not go to see his movie fearing that it would have been a comedy. The opposite effect here whereas I have been Bamboozled into thinking this movie was a genuine horror film & yet comedy was severely implemented into it. So , the people who made The Elephant Man , lied about who directed it. So , in closing , people didn't want to see An all of American Werewolf In London because they got too scared & left the theater early & people , if they knew Mel Brooks directed The Elephant Man , would go to see Brooks' movie with a strict un-opened mind in thinking that The Elephant Man would have been a comedy. Polar opposite intentions apparently. I am so glad Brooks chose to not be inclusive of his name being associated with The Elephant Man. I am sure that the typecast of his history in movie making would have disappointed those who would have attended the showing of this movie who were hoping for comedy , but got drama in the purest natural form expected. Mel Brooks deceived the movie-goer's with great intentions of making a movie that he wanted people to take seriously even if it means to be hiding being an alternative director's name for protection. When I looked up this movie , An American Werewolf In London on my cable box , it had it listed as the genre of ""Horror."" I am not used to , nor would ever ever be comfortable with movies being made or called Horror / Comedies.
  There is no such thing or should be no such thing as Horror / Comedy. That is completely an oxymoron genre. Other than a few movies that follow that genre. ""Little Shop Of Horrors , ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" & maybe the less known rarely heard of horror comedy ""Saturday The 14th."" If I had a small helpful hint of preparedness for this being a Horror / Comedy right off the cuff in the beginning before watching it , I either would have changed my mind into not wanting to watch it because I would have thought it was stupid for someone to make a Horror / Comedy movie or would have seen it preparing myself for obvious stupidity & that I would have kicked myself for knowing it was a stupid movie , but chose to watch it anyways against my better judgement.
  Either way , I think this movie should have been called a Horror / Comedy & not labeled as a Horror movie only. But , damn me for not remembering this director for making stupid juvenile movies like Animal House to ever set aside my typecasting thoughts to think that John Landis could actually sit down & figure out a way to make a serious movie for which I thought this one was. I thought that knowing that Mel Brooks created such an excellent tear-jerker as The Elephant Man & was able to write comedy as well as drama , that maybe I could have opened my mind up to a comedy writer & or director who makes comedies for a living , could also have the equal talent in writing & or directing a horror movie equally. I was wrong , I have been kicking myself for watching this movie & was severely disappointed for ever thinking that John Landis could ever rise above his single & closed minded talents of being able to only write comedies & never write real Horror movies as this one has so elusively tried to be passed off as that being a horror film.""",1395360000,,10548,4.252117588440458

In AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981), writer/director John Landis respectfully tips his hat to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-Chaney-Jr-lycanthropic-classic-of-40-years-earlier/dp/B00001TZ6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon Chaney Jr. lycanthropic classic of 40 years earlier</a>, then deftly surpasses that picture both stylistically and cinematically. In special effects alone, this one is worlds beyond the clumsy film overlaps used to transform Chaney from an upright man to an upright hirsute. Under a full moon, Landis's misfortunate bite victim moans, screams, thrashes, emits guttural sounds and writhes in naked terror as hands and feet elongate into paws, face stretches to a snout, body hair thickens to sparse fur and the newly-born creature loses all bipedal abilities.

We witness this chillingly detailed metamorphosis one time only, and that's more than adequate. Often the stalking monster is represented by a camera looking out from its viewpoint; also effective as we close in on fleeing prey. There's gore, but it's not gratuitous and is used only when necessary. A new element is that those killed by a werewolf are doomed to wander Earth as undeads until the last of the creatures either commits suicide or is destroyed, which is best accomplished by someone who loves the man underneath the wolf.

Simply put: despite a recent CGI-laden version, this well-done, by turns dramatic, humorous and frightening work just may be the werewolf to see. Highly recommended!",1394150400,,1757,5.85546875

At 1 hour 38 minutes there's virtually no drag in the pacing and the ending cascades into the closing credits with  a note of 'take that- any questions- tough!!'

The supplements are quite beefy with over 2 hours of total bonus content plus an audio commentary.

2662682,4,B000IONJHE,"Some things about American Werewolf have not aged well - some of the dialog is a bit cheesy and I couldn't help thinking after the initial werewolf attack, why didn't David go immediately home to the U.S. (or his folks come get him)? It is a weird moment of illogic that David would stay on vacation after his best friend was killed.

But putting plot problems aside, there are brilliant moments - the undead cheerfully suggesting ways for David to commit suicide (in a porn theater no less) is one of the greatest scenes in a horror film ever. The make-up and special effects hold up 30 years on; Jacks wounds and advancing decay are remarkably good and morbidly funny. But its the amazing transformation, still the gold standard for werewolves, that keeps me enthralled. Yes, it is still that good and that it was made purely with practical effects (i.e. no animation or post effects) is still a marvel.",1383004800,,905,4.65625

The buffering/fluidity of the stream was just fine--not perfect, but no real issues.  Image quality was murky, and I was a little disappointed that the film was in standard aspect ratio rather than widescreen.  Many of the ""monster moments"" in the film were too dark to really see.

2662698,4,B000IONJHE,"Considered a monster movie classic, 1981's `An American Werewolf in London' is a great example of how humor and mayhem can cohesively exist without becoming a parody.  While there an elements of this film that feel corny or cheesy, they are effectively masked by the film's eerie atmosphere and brilliant effects work.

The film tells the story of two American boys from New York who are taking three months to travel Europe.  They start in London, much to the dismay of Jack, who really wants to meet up with some chick in Italy.  One night they stumble across an eerie pub where the locals kick them out and they wind up inadvertently walking along the moor, where they are attacked by a vicious beast.  Jack is slain, but his friend David is merely injured before the beast is killed.  David wakes up weeks later, in the hospital, with memories of a giant wolf despite claims from the police and locals that it was an escaped madman who attacked the boys.  David experiences bizarre nightmares, which concern him, especially when his dead best friend appears to come back, claiming to be rotting away in limbo waiting for the curse to be lifted.  In other words; David needs to kill himself, because he is now a werewolf and none of his victims can truly die until he is dead himself.

David refuses to accept his own fate and winds up carrying on a relationship with his nurse, Alex, until the inevitable happens and the moon is...full.

The buildup to the actual transformation is free flowing, and the actual scene is remarkably done.  This film earned that Makeup Oscar hands down, delivering a chilling sequence that is as grotesque as it is intriguing, and even stands up to today's standards of movie magic.  Sadly, once David becomes a wolf the film gets a tad lazy.  It's almost rushing to get to the end, sparing all suspense for a briskly paced collage of attacks that are too quick and too `off screen' to be all that chilling.  The final scene is a chaotic five minutes of blood, fur and car crashes and then the film just ends.

I can't decide if that sudden ending is brilliant or lazy.

The film spends a lot of time leading up to the bloodshed, but the first half is superior in many ways to the second, since it moves at the same brisk pace yet feels more interested and thought out.  I only wish that more thought had been put into making the hunting scenes and the kill scenes truly blood curdling.  Still, I understand why this is considered a classic and beloved by so many.  It is brisk, funny and effective in many of the right places.",1380499200,,2562,4.530434782608696

2662703,4,B000IONJHE,"Okay - here it is. The werewolf that is on the top of favorite lists for many is not my favorite fur flick by far. This isn't saying the film was  bad; no, not at all, far from it. But was it all it was hyped up to be?

Before the fur starts flying as I list negative points, let's first start with the good stuff. For one thing, the atmosphere. The scenery really stands out in this film and deserves a mention as one of the first pro checkoffs. It's breathtaking, beautiful, yada yada; set in the hills of England.

 The movie DOES starts well - the characters are hiking and talking. We get a general feel through decent dialogue of who they are and their general personality. There is fog everywhere when they leave the diner after ominous hints from the people there. And when the werewolf strikes, it's a scary as hell scene! Out of the Howling and this one put together, this has to take the cake as the creepiest part from both movies. Unfortunitely, this was basically the only frightening part. After the attack, the dark and well-done intro becomes a movie as inconsistent as a roller coaster.

 Now that I've unleashed all that, let me get this off my chest. From over the top humor, the underacting of almost every character except David Naughton, and other stuff that simply baffles me, it's unclear what type of film this really is supposed to be. Seems some of the time meant for humor, other times serious. These things can be blended into a movie, fine, but here it just came out not knowing what it wanted to be. The end result left me confused.

 One thing was the friend from the dead. It's nice to know once you're massacred in a horrifying way and your life is shortened way too much, that you can come back and retain your sense of humor. The makeup effects of him decomposing were excellent but the character itself simply annoyed me. Griffin Dunne was competent in the role of Jack (dead and undead) but the movie would have went along more interestingly without comedic dead people popping up. I would have prefered David to uncover the truth for himself, and leave out the rotting wisecracking sidekicks.

 I think Robert Ebert sums it up better than I just did with this quote from his review:

Landis never seems very sure whether he's making a comedy or a horror film, so he winds up with genuinely funny moments acting as counterpoint to the gruesome undead. Combining horror and comedy is an old tradition (my favorite example is BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN), but the laughs and the blood coexist very uneasily in this film.

 Another big gripe I could not help noticing (and please believe I am NOT exagerating) is that everyone in London is so damn CALM.

 ""A werewolf you say? Hm, interesting...""

 You could tell these people that their family had just been strung up and disemboweled and they would hardly blink. Their faces for the most part stay so serious and stiff no matter they hear or see, and even during some of the attacks you would expert more of a reaction. This made it harder for me to get into, but I did enjoy shaking my head in amazement at these people. Is the culture really so hard to surprise?

 In this movie werewolves apparently have insatiable appetites. During the reign of their ""change"", they kill and eat. Not once, not twice, but many times. And it seems they do this every night!

 There were other inconsistencies. When David was changed but didn't know it yet, he observed cats, dogs, ect all being frightened of him. But in the zoo, animals don't seem bothered. When he wakes as a human, there is no blood on him anywhere. He also seems to wake up really in the mood, must be some werewolf hormonal thing.

 There was no tension or build up after the first attack. Not really any stalking scenes, nothing that could be considered frightening. This bugged me as I enjoyed the feel of the beginning and wanted it to continue. The pace of the movie is also pretty slow.

 The ending was very abrupt and cut off. After the light tone of the movie to the dark serious tone, back again, forward again, and we're all dizzy from mood changes...we have a grim quick ending with sudden credits of upbeat, wild, crazy music!?! I wasn't in an upbeat mood by far when this went off.

 I had always really looked forward to this movie and have to say it was a letdown. There were some great scenes - the opening, the long transformation scene that has to be one of the most realistic in lycanthrope history - but I prefer my werewolf flicks darker. And if they're not dark and attempt humor instead, I enjoy it only if I find that humor amusing.",1379635200,,4597,4.480815347721823
2662704,5,B000IONJHE,"This review is for the Full Moon Edition Blu-ray.  I hadn't seen the film in 20 years or so, and everything really held up well.  This is not a dated film.  Lots of humour and a few laugh out loud moments.  Amazon lists the tons of features this disc has.  They are good.  There's a ""new"" documentary which interviews all relevant cast and crew quite nicely and you hear lots of stories.  I think it's nearly as long as the film itself.  After, that most of the rest of the features are from earlier releases of the film, so if you watch those you're hearing most of the same stories, but from people with about 10 years less gray in their hair.

2662733,4,B000IONJHE,"I've been slowly catching up on the 'great' horror movies that came out in the 80s, and for the most part, I've been disappointed more often than I've been impressed. An American Werewolf in London however, was a fun and entertaining combo breaker. The last good horror movie I saw over the last 6-7 months was John Carpenter's The Thing, and while Werewolf might not be on par with it in some categories, it's just as memorable. I remember seeing parts of this movie on Comedy Central in the mid/late-90s, and I couldn't figure out why it was on there at the time. After sitting through the whole movie, I can now see a lot of the comedy, and it holds up quite well.

David and Jack are two young American men backpacking through Europe. While in England, they check out a small tavern called The Slaughtered Lamb, which has a picture of a monstrous wolf head on the sign for some reason. When they enter, the locals immediately stop talking and watch the foreigners in silence, not offering them any help. Ordering food and drinks doesn't go any better, but when they quote a western movie, one of the guys starts to go off with his own joke, getting the others into his story and setting the mood back up. However, the boys ask why there's a 5-pointed star drawn on one of the walls, and that's it. Silence again. They get out, and are attacked by a large wolf a few minutes later. Jack is brutally slashed apart, and dies as a result. David is about to suffer the same fate, but the guys from the tavern intervene and blow it to bits with their guns. David wakes up in a hospital 3 weeks later with a few nice scars from the fight. Local law enforcement already have a story ready- that he was attacked by a lunatic who broke loose. Weird huh? David also starts to have visions of running through the woods naked, and of strange dog-soldiers killing people mercilessly. While in the hospital he starts a little romance with one of the nurses, Alex, who is kind enough to let him stay in her home now that his friend is dead and he has nowhere to go. Unfortunately, David is also beginning to hallucinate Jack, who decays more and more each time he sees him. Jack warns David that he's in limbo, unable to move on to the afterlife because of a curse. David is now a werewolf because he survived the attack, and the bloodline needs to be stopped. Sure enough, a full moon appears shortly after this warning, and all hell breaks loose.

An American Werewolf in London has this nice blend of horror and comedy. It's not done in the same way as say, Shaun of the Dead, but when the comedy comes in, you can't help but laugh. This really surprised me after a fairly serious beginning with the gruesome wolf attack. There's a scene later on in the film where undead Jack is talking to David in an adult theater, and the undead versions of people David killed as a werewolf appear in the seats around him. They all offer ways on how he can kill himself to stop the curse so they can get out of limbo, and one couple is very enthusiastic with their advice. Without missing a beat, they cut to something else to end the scene, and I was laughing out loud due to how absurd it was. There are other moments like this, and I won't spoil them. The movie's pacing is excellent, with no time wasted on boring character development that wouldn't matter either way. The relationship David and Alex have is cute, and both characters are likable. Both her and his doctor want to help figure out what's wrong with him, though we know the guy doesn't have much of a chance in finding a real cure for his problem, especially when Jack doesn't offer any solutions other than suicide/death.

Rick Baker did a hell of a job with the makeup and special effects. Most of the werewolf shots seem to be just a wolf head puppet that comes into frame to bite people. When the actual transformation takes place, it's a sight to behold, especially considering the year this movie came out. Hands stretching out, claws breaking through finger nails, feet changing shape...I was genuinely impressed by the work here. Even the kills were done pretty well for the most part, like Jack getting mauled in the beginning. I'm so used to the camera cutting away after a few seconds, yet that wolf just goes to town on him. It's relentless! To be fair, that's the longest kill in the movie, and most of the others aren't on the same page. There's still a good bit of suspense for what it's worth.

Horror movies rarely do anything for me. Part of the reason is because I saw Pet Sematary and It when I was a little kid, and nothing since then scared me. As far as favorites go, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is probably always going to be my favorite, and there are few that I can enjoy when watching a second time. An American Werewolf in London though, will most likely be viewed a few more times. It's just plain fun!",1368316800,,4887,4.4206437291897895
2662734,5,B000IONJHE,"Well, if you're in the market for a great werewolf movie that has a sense of humor, then see An American Werewolf in London (1981)--hands down the best werewolf movie ever made!

Steering clear of formulaic horror movie plot clichs, An American Werewolf in London avoids immature promiscuous summer campers and delinquent drug-using twenty-somethings with loose morals as we are introduced to our protagonists David and Jack.  Yes, they're twenty-somethings.  And yes, they have their quippy repartees.  But their immaturity is no more than an otherwise responsible pair of men enjoying a night of manhood away from the wife and kids.  They're actually somewhat mature when things aren't crazy.

They unintentionally make their way to The Slaughtered Lamb Pub, a northern Englishman's locals-only sort of place adorned with a pentacle on the wall.  They are a backwoodsy, superstitious and secretive lot.  More fearful of the locals than anything they could encounter among the full moon, dreary weather and local fauna, they flee into the wilderness to be met with some sort of animal attack.  David in injured by this ""animal.""

During his recovery David dreams about some in-the-buff jaunts in the forest followed by some very disturbing visions of evil ""werewolf soldiers.""  As clearly indicated by the movie's title, this recovery occurs in London, he occasionally turns into a werewolf and people get eaten.  David's lovely nurse Alex takes a shining to him and invites him to stay with her.

While David lives with the curse of lycanthropy, his victims are also cursed.  These now undead victims appear before David, flayed and gory, and serve as an ""everything you ever wanted to know about werewolves, full moons and lycanthropy"" guide.  As we see David's undead victims throughout the film their level of decomposition advances and you can't help but to smile when they point that out.  Great make-up, by the way!  Sprinkling more comedic charm on this gory horror are the sharp-tongued jokes and off color behavior of David's haunters.

The transformation scenes are really something.  We see his hands slowly elongate and HEAR his bones  and tendons stretching, giving root to the maddening pain he seems to be going through--I mean, I almost FELT it myself.  So then, when his vertebrae elevate, his shoulder blades protrude and his skull begins to elongate you predict more pain as if you were watching someone brace themselves before resetting your dislocated shoulder.  His nudity during this scene properly conveys his vulnerability and you genuinely feel sympathy for all of his suffering.  All the while, some ironically pleasant music is playing in the background on Alex's record player in her kitschy living room.

Fully transformed, he looks like a wolf after an ""evil"" HGH binge on chest and arms day.  But not so much like a wolf-man.  This is a nice change of pace even when compared to today's werewolves in which our shapeshifters become regular-sized normal looking wolves (e.g., Hemlock Grove), giant normal looking wolves (e.g., the Twilight Saga), wolves from a twisted R-rated Alice in Wonderland (e.g., Ginger Snaps), classic wolfmen (e.g., The Wolfman, Wolf, Teen Wolf), the wolfman on steroids (e.g., Van Helsing, Cursed) or the reversed man-wolf (e.g., the Underworld series, Being Human, An American Werewolf in Paris).

Writer/director John Landis is epic in comedy--having brought us Animal House (1978), The Blues Brothers (1979), Trading Places (1983) and Coming to America (1986) to name a few--and he's even had other successful forays in a least semi-humorous or satirical horror (e.g., The Twilight Zone movie, Innocent Blood), but I find it stunning that he was responsible for the greatest werewolf movie of all time!  And this is hardly just my opinion.  While some favor The Howling (1981) or Ginger Snaps (2000), online lists tend to include London in the top five or six (if not #1) more than any other.

The story is good, but clearly not without some forgivable issues.  What made this movie truly great was Landis' ability to be brilliantly funny at times, while keeping a straight, serious, even brutal tone during the violent, rending scenes, the wincing transformation and the final scene with nurse Alex and David such that I wouldn't dare call this a straight up horror-comedy or a satire; simply a great, very serious werewolf movie that also happens to be often funny when things aren't dire.

It doesn't matter how old you are.  The effects truly hold up and stand the test of time so don't worry that the lack of CGI will make it uncool.  Just see it!!!",1368057600,,4617,5.063492063492063
2662735,4,B000IONJHE,Two young boys are backpacking through Europe. They stop at a weird tavern. The people inside are not very nice and they leave. One of the boys is killed by the werewolf and the other is just scratched. The people from the tavern are nice enough to shoot the werewolf after they let the boys go out of the tavern knowing the werewolf was out there. The surviving boy is in a coma for three weeks after a scratch on his face and a few on his chest. The one on his chest is clearly a wolf scratch. But everyone is saying that a lunatic killed his friend and scratched him. The new concept is that the victims of the werewolf are undead until the werewolf dies. They haunt him trying to convince him to kill himself. That was the new twist on the old werewolf story that adds dark humor and breathes new life into an old tale.,1367798400,,823,4.182389937106918

David is a werewolf who must die to set his victims souls free. So, the plot is twisted but what horror film's plot isn't. The plus with this film, the part I liked, is the transformation David goes through to become the wolf. In an age where everything is cgied, it almost seems like costumes and makeup have become a lost art. Some cgi effects, like those in Cursed, are just terrible. Here, you don't have that.

The performances of David Naughton and Griffin Dunn are outstanding in this film and their buddies for life (and death) relationship is not only believable, but helps to raise this film above what could have turned into just a mediocre gore fest. Although some people might feel that the special effects are a bit dated, this movie's transformation scene was filmed without the benefit of CGI and stands-up pretty well on its own (even by todays standards). Director John Landis does a fine job of blending in humor with the horror to keep the audience interested. Dunn's character has quite a few witty comments as well as a deteriorating physique. It all mades for a bit of ghoulish fun. If you're a horror fan and you haven't alreay seen this one check it out!",1355011200,,808,4.6573426573426575
2662757,4,B000IONJHE,"But that's what makes it so interesting.  Let me start off by saying that I don't get why some people criticize the acting; I don't think the movie was challenging enough to merit me calling any of the performances brilliant, but nobody pulled me out of the movie and all the leads interacted in a manner that I found natural and charming.

All the elements of a good horror movie are here, even if they aren't as polished as we might expect in a finished product.  On top of that, American Werewolf is funny, and it doesn't seem like it's trying too hard (because horror hadn't yet evolved into its self-parodying phase).  To me, the basic story is similar to a classic tragedy: David has a fatal flaw, being a werewolf, which admittedly is not his fault but which leads to his untimely death.  I found myself actually sympathizing with the characters quite a bit.  Is it more awful to be trapped as a zombie, or to have your zombie best friend come and tell you to kill yourself?  I don't usually care this much.  Poor Alex, too, was put through a confusing and traumatic couple of days.  When I first watched the movie, the abrupt ending had me shouting at the screen in disbelief.  Now, though in a way it's another example of the movie not being complete, I actually kind of like it like that.  There really wasn't that much more to say.  Though I feel very silly comparing this to Hamlet, think of the last few scenes of that play.  There's a huge dramatic scene in which pretty much everyone dies, then a bit more dialogue with Horatio and we're done.  If it's not a problem there then I'm not so sure it's a problem in American Werewolf.

In spite of what I just said, the movie does have some issues with pacing.  A good example is the scene preceding David's first transformation, where he just messes with stuff in Alex's house for I think the full duration of CCR's Bad Moon Rising.  I'm willing to forgive because that's such an awesome song, but probably the time could have been used a bit better.  As I understand it, the werewolf transformation itself is a very iconic scene on which many others have been based; I can certainly see the resemblance to the transformations in Being Human, as one example.  My favorite scenes in the movie are any involving Jack, and anything that happens between when David wakes up in the zoo and when he runs away from Alex.  Funniest part of the movie.  ""Mummy, a naked American man stole my balloon!"".  Speaking of nudity, I'm grateful for the matter-of-fact approach, both in the sex scene and when David is running around London.  There's nothing too graphic, but there are no odd contortions of the camera to avoid showing anything but feet and elbows.  The sex scene doesn't exist just to highlight naked Alex, either, which I appreciate.  Though a bit... sudden, it's a character moment.

Altogether, this movie is great for analyzing if you're interested in how films are put together, and it's an interesting twist on that buddy comedy thing the '80s loved so much.  (Also very '80s: the fever dream or whatever when the monsters break in and kill David's family; I'm still not quite sure what the point of that was.)  I'd recommend American Werewolf to some of my friends but not others.  I'd recommend it to anyone reading this, because whether you like it or not it's not very much of your time.  Go watch it on Netflix if you can.",1354838400,,3394,4.534539473684211

2662762,5,B000IONJHE,"John Landis' contemporary horror classic is back, resurrected like the Abominable Dr. Phibes via BlU-RAY!!!!  This is the film that landed Landis the coveted ""Master of Horror"" title early on in his career.

How did he know?  How did he know to make the werewolf transformation so stunningly realistic?  How did he know to shoot it in bright lighting?  How did he know to build up to the horror with humor?  How did he know that humor and horror would go so well together?

Well, there are commonsense answers to all these questions if you take time to study John Landis' body of work, and to listen to his philosophy and hear his influences.  When I talk to the new generation of filmgoers, I'm confronted by individuals who say ""John Landis?  What has he done?""  Then when I list all the incredible cutting edge movies he's made and how he was one of the first directors to work with Michael Jackson and Eddie Murphy, and how he has always been a director who has celebrated diversity, not necessarily because he makes a conscious effort to do so but because that's the wonderful progressive man that he is -- the response I get is ""Oh. So?""

Or they boil him down to the man who directed ""Thriller"" (a great and wonderful film in its own right.  And yes, it was a film).

Part of the reason is that much time has passed between films like ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"" so that younger audiences forget how original and entertaining those movies were upon their release.

""Werewolf"" continues the tradition of using the genre to explore the cruel poetic nature of fate that was established in ""The Wolfman"" with Lon Chaney. Landis has a wicked sense of humor, so he can't help but laugh at the circumstances that befall the protagonist even as he seems to be revolted by the same.  And that's precisely what this movie is a study in -- the attraction of the abject.  Landis has to give us full frontal werewolf transformation that at the time was only rivaled by Joe Dante's equally enthralling ""The Howling.""  We have to see the horror; we are not going to look away from it, but we can still appreciate its irony.  Hence, humor as a coping mechanism.

People often talk about ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" playing right before Mr. Blonde slices off the cop's ear in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" but Landis (and others before him) was doing the same thing in ""Werewolf"" years before (no disrespect to the Dogs).  Who can forget Sam Cooke's ""Blue Moon"" during David's painful transmogrification?  Or the sickening 'anxiety' inducing use of ""Bad Moon Rising"" as David paces nervously around the apartment waiting to do the werewolf equivalent of ""throwing up.""

If you like werewolf movies but haven't seen this, then do yourself a favor and watch it.  Better yet, if you like this movie and have not seen Landis' vampire horror comedy ""Innocent Blood,"" go ahead and make it a double feature.  If you still want more of Landis' dark stuff, then you can also look up 2011's ""Burke and Hare"" with Simon Pegg.  For another fun, pulpy werewolf movie, Wes Craven's ""Cursed"" is great silly fun, while Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" is absolutely genius.",1349913600,,3161,4.652252252252253

Follow an unfortunate American pair of friends as they meet up with their worst nightmare on vacation in England and by the end of it, you will find yourself pitying the great terrifying beast that is wreaking havoc on the town of London.  In my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made and much more riveting than your usual horror movie.",1327795200,,629,4.743119266055046
2662775,5,B000IONJHE,"AWESOME!!!!!

That's how I would describe.  The movie is a good one.  I think you already know that.  If you don't, I would suggest to watch it and decide.  It might be a little old fashion for some (and they might be right, I mean, this movie is almost 30 years old), but still manages to impress.  The best proof was my youger brother saying ""good transformation!"" when the wolf came up and screaming ""#%!!"" almost at the end, when the wolf taked midtown London.

Anyway, believe me, the movie is good fun, even for today standards.

Being said that, what I like the most of this edition is the special features.  That's the solely reason why I buy Blu Rays.  Special features.  Extra content.  Otherwise I would just rent the thing.

I haven't seen it all yeat, but only the long documentary ""Beware the Moon"" worth the purchase.  Is a VERY detail documentary about the initial idea, the casting, filming, scenes, make-up, puppets, effects and a lot of stuff that gives you an amazing insight of how this movie came to be.  There's even a very short but fun snippet about the ""porn"" movie on the theater scene.  VERY good stuff!!!

2662777,5,B000IONJHE,"AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON

In many ways, John Landis' American Werewolf in London could be considered a sequel to the original Curt Siodmak 1941 version, paying tribute to the werewolf mythology Siodmak established.  But in the tradition of a good sequel, Landis add new flavor to the story and creates a new visual of the werewolf that makes it unique.  Landis combines great location, plot, and special effects to make this movie memorable and a jewel in the crown of the horror film genre.

The story involves two friends on a trip in Europe.  While stopped in Northern England, they are attacked by a werewolf.  David is merely wounded by the creature, but he soon starts having strange dreams and a rather odd visit from his dead friend Jack who perished during the attack.  Jack reveals the truth to David--he was bitten by a werewolf and on the next full moon he too shall morph and prowl the night in search of victims.

It's great how Landis uses most of the same iconography from the original--the attack by the werewolf, the pentagram, the full moon.  But the added elements of David's terrible dreams and haunting visits from Jack contribute a fantastic way to build the suspense leading up to the first transformation scene.  These parts are really great, too.  While being visited by your dead friend in various states of decomposition is unnerving, David's dreams are not much better.  They are expertly devised to build the idea that David is not well and provide fantastic entertainment while waiting for the transformation.

The transformation itself is some of the best special effect work ever.  It's not just a quick scene where the camera pans away and when the shot comes back we have a werewolf.  Instead, we get an up close view of the entire procedure as it is happening.  The wolf itself is really cool and a leap from the earlier depictions of a half man-half wolf creature.  This wolf is much animal in appearance, and certainly more demonic looking.  It's a powerful beast with red eyes, wide gaping jaws lined with razor sharp teeth, and a howl more like a hellish scream than something natural.  In other words, it's a very original and scary monster.

Surrounded by all this hellish bloodshed is a rather unusual dose of humor.  I guess this should not come as a surprise considering Landis has made some classic comedies, but there are a few scenes in particular that will stand out.  I have in mind the one in which David seeks refuge from his demons in an X-rated theater.  It's a must-see scene.  It's a good assumption that this humor is intended to lighten the mood, but it also seems at times to compliment the whole absurdity of David's tragic situation, too.

In this respect David and Larry Talbot of the Wolf Man have much in common.  Both are Americans who find love while in England, both are cursed with this terrible condition, and both don't have much hope for recovery.  But like Larry Talbot, this is what makes the movie engaging.  You like David and you can't help to feel bad for the poor guy.  He's just a young guy looking forward to the start of a full life when suddenly the world around him collapses.  He must face the fact that his carefree life has just come to a crashing end and in its place is death, decay, and despair.

The technical aspects such as the camera work, use of locations, and the special effects combine to create a wonderfully creative movie filled with exotic notions and mystical ideas.  The film succeeds because it hits all the right buttons and is captivating for every second it plays.  There is never a dull moment and it's one of those movies you can watch anytime, over and over without it getting old.",1326758400,,3694,4.651234567901234
2662778,5,B000IONJHE,"This film is a classic, it was done in the early 80's and for that time the special effects were excellent; and still seem to give some that chill up the spine. I was very young when I went to the theater to see this movie with my folks,  around 9 years old. I remember it really creeped me out; but it had a somewhat comical side to it. I recommend this movie to any horror fan,  and to any one who wants to see a horror flick plus a little comedy with it. I do have to say the ending is a tragic one, but the movie is excellent without a lot of gore.

The Blu-Ray version is a WONDERFUL rerelease, with newly fixed up sound, picture, color, and overall quality. It also includes special features nearly worth the price of entry on their own. I have owned this film in VHS, in DVD, and now, in gloriously restored Blu Ray. This is worth every cent, and I am something of a die-hard ""never rebuy films in a new format"" person. But this movie keeps improving with each newly-minted technological advance, and Blu Ray seems to have nailed the ultimate version down. Perfect color. Perfect picture (minus the unavoidable remnants of that era's film-recording methods). AMAZING sound (and is the howl STILL not one of, if not THE, scariest sound effects, EVER???). Pick this up.

2662782,5,B000IONJHE,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

I First saw ""An American Werewolf in London"" in the theater, way back in 1981. 1981 was the greatest year for Lycanthrope films, not producing one or two masterpieces, but three! ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""the Howling,"" & """"Wolfen,"" all different, but all masterpieces in horror, let alone the Werewolf sub-genre, & I loved it, as Werewolves were always my favorite monster, other than giant monster films.

""An American Werewolf in London"" stands as my third favorite horror film of all time, behind ""Hellraiser"" & ""the Exorcist"" historically, but I find myself enjoying ""An American Werewolf in London,"" now more than ""Hellraiser."" That is really saying something for me & this film, as I've watched the film probably fifty times in the thirty years it has been out. This is what truly makes a great horror film, or any great movie for that matter, one that repays the watcher with great entertainment, viewing after viewing, year after year. A movie that you can probably almost recite every line of dialog, & you find your self sometimes spouting off lines from it in a conversation. That is what ""An American Werewolf in London"" means to me.

""An American Werewolf in London"" is without a doubt in my opinion, the greatest comedy/horror movie ever made. It has terrifying moments of dread & suspense, it has great jump out of your seat scenes, & it has comedic scenes that match the terror & horror of this film, a relief from the tension it builds. It is filled with pathos, comedy & creepiness all at the same time in scenes with David & Jack. Jack was killed by a Werewolf in the first part of the movie (that in it's self is one of the greatest scenes in horror) & rises back from the dead to tell David who was also attacked, but survived, that he will become a Werewolf in two days, the start of the full moon. David does not know whether he is hallucinating or dreaming Jack at first, & questions his own sanity. These scenes are some of the best in the movie, they truly make you jump when you first see Jack appear. They make you laugh with their delicious black comedy. They make you shudder with their eeriness as Jack talks straight to David about becoming a Werewolf, killing people, making others, & that he is the last in line of the Werewolves & should take his own life, so all the victims from previous Werewolf attacks can move on from being bound to walking the earth. There is such pathos in these scenes, that it causes sadness, as the two actors are truly superb in their performances, there is great chemistry here. I really can't understand why David Naughton, who plays David, fell into obscurity after this film, his sad, funny, & terrifying performance as the man doomed to be a werewolf is one of the greatest performances in horror. You really feel empathy for this person. You care what happens to him. You feel his pain. Also a special mention for David's dream's sequences, truly disturbing dreams.

All of the actors in this movie give top flight performances, from the men & a woman at the Slaughtered Lamb, to the doctor who cares for David, to the beautiful, truly talented actress, Jenny Agutter, the nurse who falls in love with David. The end scene is a real heart wrencher. I'm not  ashamed to say, even after all these years, it gets me every time.

The make-up & transformation scene in this film was & still is a landmark, & 30 years latter, it has not been matched, though ""the Howling"" came close. Speaking of ""the Howling,"" Rick Baker started doing make up for that film, but then left for ""An American Werewolf in London,"" because this was his & John Landis's dream movie. Rob Bottin then took over the reins for the make up of ""the Howling"" & did a wonderful job, as he has many times since. I've always liked two legged Werewolves over four, but it is a great tribute to Rick Baker, that he has made the most terrifying Werewolf ever, one with four legs. A hound straight from hell, right in to your worse nightmare!

A special mention has to be made about the soundtrack to this film, one of the greatest in horror! ""Blue Moon,"" ""Moon Dance, & ""Bad Moon Rising,"" really add atmosphere to this film. The original music is great too, especially during the scenes with Jack & David. All of sound track first rate, which is so important to making a film more successful!

Anyone who has even a remote interest in horror films must see ""An American Werewolf in London, not only because it is the greatest Werewolf film ever made, or for that matter, one of the greatest horror films ever made, but it's more than that, it is a masterpiece of movie making! Long destined to be a film remembered for decades to come!

The Blu ray was great! Though there is some grain in some of the scenes shot at a distance, but the close ups are crisp. The colors are vivid. The sound is great for a film this age. Well worth the upgrade!",1321660800,,4904,4.525959367945824
2662783,4,B000IONJHE,"I saw this movie when it when it premiered in 1981. I'm sure that the special effects dazzled me 30 years ago, but the campy, tongue-in-cheek comedy stuck with me all these years. ""Stick to the roads, stay clear of the moors,"" has been my Halloween mantra ever since. This is the precursor to Buffy, Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead. Not a laugh a minute or really bloody gory, it's more like a visual of Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London.""",1319932800,,443,4.481481481481482
2662784,4,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf in London(Aug. 81)stars David Naughton and Griffin Dunne in this decent man turned wolf-er film of the early 80s,all under the aegis of director John Landis. The film has been remastered well and looks better than ever.
I hadn`t seen this film since its`debut in 81,so I was just going by recollection. I remember the film as a whole not being an outstanding effort but more so recall the wonderfully eery special effects and top notch makeup jobs. The story involves the two stars as tourists roaming the English Moors in England. It gets late,it is raining and miserable and the two decide to seek shelter in a small local pub. The locals don`t like these intruders and when Dunne asks about a pentagram on the wall the two decide it is warmer outside than it is in. While hiking in the dark they are attacked by something that kills Dunne and leaves Naughton bitten and in the hospital to recover in London. The local police do not believe the distraught Naughton but over time his attending doctor seems to find enough in his story to investigate it personally.
Naughton boards with his attending nurse and the two become closerthanthis. However Naughton over time receives some visits by his dead buddy warning him that he has been bitten by a werewolf and that by the next full moon it is HE that will be roaming the streets of London on a killing spree. Naughton is at first totally skeptical but in the end he does indeed turn and starts a killing rampage. On one of them at the end of the film Naughton,the werewolf,has been cornered in an alley by a theatre and is subsequently shot and killed by police as he tries to lunge towards his loving nurse.
What is really compelling about this film is not so much the story,which is a decent one overall,but the special effects and make up. The detail of the man turning into a werewolf and the sight of a decaying Dunne as he reappears to Naughton in order to help his buddy,even in death,holds up brilliantly even today. It was so impressive even back in the early 80s that I believe that the AMPAS created a new award category just for this film-Outstanding Achievement in Makeup-which has been presented ever since. And speaking of Dunne`s reappearances,this was also what made AWIL such a hit then;the sly sense of humour throughout. Both the stars under-acted in order to provide us with a more natural and realistic interpretation of two buds,far from home and homesick,in for the long haul,as it were. The overall effect and impact of the film today isn`t,however,as sharp as I recall it back then. This is in large part due to myself and the vast improvement of SFX in general since that time.
Technically speaking the film is in its original widescreen aspect ratio of 1:85:1 and has been remastered,looking better than I remember. This two disc edition does the entire film up right. In fact I would give the package a five star rating. It includes such extras as:the trailer,commentary by the two stars,two features on the film with the cast,director and make up artist Rick Baker,another looking at Bakers handy work,a featurette on the making of AWIL,a talk with Baker about the film,outtakes,storyboards and much more.
I recommend AWIL to all looking for a decent scary movie to watch at home with some friends and alot of popcorn. The story takes a back seat to the SFX which were groundbreaking for its time. Give it a peek-see!",1317427200,,3420,4.6827242524916945
2662785,5,B000IONJHE,"I really wish I had this one on BD.

Werewolves have always held my #1 spot in supernatural fiction. And all of the good ones are wrapped in tragedy; we actually feel bad for the beast. I dare say I have seen every werewolf film ever released, with the obvious exception of 1913's The Werewolf. But this one is in the Top Three, only beaten by Lon Chaney Jr.'s the Wolf-Man (1941) and Ladyhawke (1985, though it wasn't solely about the werewolf, it fits in my opinion).

We have two friends crossing the moors outside northern England, attacked by a werewolf. One dies, the other lives and turns into the beast. The real problem is, John Landis wanted the movie to seem ridiculous, so for every scare there is a timeless joke. At times, the film may make no sense, as the main character truly thinks he's losing his mind. The film enforces that with bizarre scenes, like a bunch of werewolf-Nazi stormtroopers breaking into a quiet suburban home and laying waste to everything. The make-up effects alone make it worth watching, and if I remember correctly, they made a new category in the Oscars for Make-up f/x just because of this film. And even on DVD, the picture is crisp and clean. Dolby Digital 5.1 makes a lot of the establishing shots pretty wicked (when the kids are being hunter by the werewolf, specifically). The Special Features.... wow

The commentary is great, featuring the two friends who's lives are changed by the attack.  David Naughton and Griffin Dunne point out everything as they fondly look back on the film. Behind the Scene galore, outtakes, photo montage, a look at the make-up f/x by master Rick Baker. My personal favourite is the interview with John Landis himself. He is, as always, laughing so hard everyone becomes possessed to join in the joke with him. Listen for his 'shmuck' joke. Priceless.

If you don't mind so much about the quality of DVD v. BD, stick with the DVD. This release has more than enough extras to make it worth while. However, if you prefer increased quality through HD and BD, go for the BD version, also referred to as the Full Moon Edition.",1315267200,,2100,4.634408602150538

2662788,5,B000IONJHE,"IF you've ever seen it, you know how good it was, you don't need me telling you.  It's both hilariously funny, horrendously vicious and terrifying (those dream sequences started a whole slew of imitators, none even close to the originals here), and it was heartwarming as well.  It could've done without the obligatory love/shower/nude scenes, but that was 1980.
It's only real glaring flaw, if it can be called that, is that we never get enough of the monster itself, which set a standard for werewolves that has never been matched and never will, even with CGI, which I personally dislike in most cases.  Truly this thing was out of the realm of darkness, low mean, massive, and completely evil.
Also, ignore the town's folk and their local who was a werewolf earlier.  It makes no sense that they would keep him alive only to shoot him later, or that he himself wouldn't have committed suicide.  At the very least why would they not lock him up?  The doctor's trip out there was still good, but pointless next to the villagers' logic and benavior.
Dead and alive, Griffin Dunne carries the best humors of the film.  I liked him in Johnny Dangerously, and he proved himself again here, especially as the decaying corpse who still had Jack's wit.  When he ate the toast though, I expected to fall out of that gaping hole in his throat, but that's just me.",1314144000,,1356,4.620833333333334

The road on the moor is muddy, the air damp and chilly.  The barren hills seemingly go on forever.  As the gloom is descending into night, you enter a village.  You are cold and hungry, so when you see the pub, you hurry into the ""Slaughtered Lamb.""

The clientele hush, gawk, and then turn back to playing their games and tipping their pints.  The barmaid takes your order, a man tells a joke, and as a man is about to throw a dart, you ask, what the pentagram and candles are for?  The dart misses.  The pub's atmosphere darkens with clouds of fear and unwelcome winds blow you out into the night.

You press on, surely there is another place you can stop.  To add to your misery, a cold rain begins to shroud you in its clammy wetness.  Thankfully, it is short lived; the clouds part, moonlight bathes the mist.

To your consternation, the full moon doesn't reveal the road; where is it?  Time to go back!

2662797,4,B000IONJHE,"It had been a long time since I saw this movie.  I remembered enjoying it, so I took a chance.  Glad I did.  The acting is somewhat stiff and the special effects are the ""dated"" part in my title. I'm sure they were state of the art back then.  You can't really expect any better, but the effects were well done for the 1980's.

The dead friend of the now-werewolf that keeps popping up is one of the best aspects of the film.  The scene where that friend, along with several other of the werewolf's victims encourage him to commit suicide so that they might be free is especially well done.  No one is happy to be dead but they all must ""make the best of it"".  Kind of the English ""keeping a stiff upper lip.""  That is one of the running themes of the movie.

The ending seems a bit rushed and more of the 'not what sure we should do' variety.  You can see it coming pretty early on as the only way ""out"" but I can't say many movies are otherwise.  (Maybe Bardem's escape at the end of 'No Country for Old Men'?)",1296000000,,1012,4.107142857142857
2662798,3,B000IONJHE,"This is a pretty good monster movie with some truly fine actors, in particular Agutter.  However, unlike the classics of the genre, where a dark mood of foreboding and anguish build, this film strays into a comedy that didn't hold together for me.  You enter scary scenarios and then the actors get almost flippant, even sloppy in the way that they depart from the mood for a few laughs that don't add to the story.  For example, the nurse keeps meeting with a cute little boy who says, ""no!"", to everything she asks; this shows she is warm and it is touching, but it detracts from the plot rather than advancing it.

In terms of plot, it is pretty formulaic.  Two American friends are doing Europe, when they stumble across a strange village.  Feeling unwelcome, they walk out into the rainy night only to get attacked by you know what.  One of mauled, but survives, hence is doomed to monsterdom.  He meets a girl who falls for him, lives up to the curse, and gets offed while she is looking.  One shouldn't  expect more than this, of course, but it should cast a spell that the viewer enters and can forget everything else for a time.  This it completely fails to do, in part by indifferent direction - it feels almost like they are making it up as they go along - but also because of the misplaced humor that pops up, like the bumbling policeman whose character is never developed beyond knocking over medical instruments under the eyes of a glowering boss.

The best thing in the film is the transformation scene, which is one of the best and most graphic that I have seen in the genre.  It is well done, though the werewolf himself often appears stiff and puppet-like.  One comic twist that does work are the visits (as spirits in limbo) of his friend and victims, but even they are sometimes stupidly lighthearted.

The unbelievable thing is, it's 30 years old and yet Hollywood hasn't released one single werewolf movie that could challenge this great flick. There have been some fine efforts. The Howling, Dog Soldiers, and I know I'll catch grief for this one, but Bad Moon! (Yes, I like this one) But they are far behind when it comes to the classic An American Werewolf in London. I already owned the dvd of AAWIL, but with Blu-ray coming out and hitting more titles all the time, I just had to get the Blu-ray treatment of this fantastic film. I'm a special features buff and this one has some really good ones. I watched the entire movie, plus all of the special featurettes in one sitting.

The best of the bunch was the incredible ""Beware the Moon"" where Landis speaks about all of the negative press that the film received and how difficult it was to shoot the climax in Piccadilly Circus (considered the Times Square of London) in London's West End district. This documentary had some really great stuff here. And having learned my lesson from purchasing other older movies that received the Blu-ray treatment, my expectations were kept minimal as to how it would look. But the transfer was unexpectedly sharp! The audio was exceptional and I found this purchase a great bargain! I can watch American Werewolf in London multiple times. And David's transformation into the werewolf the first time is one of the finest transformations in cinema history without the help of computers.

2662814,5,B000IONJHE,"I ordered this movie the other day because it belongs in any horror fan's collection. I haven't received yet, so my review is simply about the movie (which I've seen a number of times). First and foremost, this movie is flat-out entertaining regardless of your preconceptions about werewolf movies.

In reading a number of the negative reviews about this movie there are concerns about the special effects. There is no CGI in this movie. Everything is done with live actors, make-up, and mock-ups. These old-school effects are top notch, and were groundbreaking at the time.  To me CGI has become rather commonplace. Unless it it very, very, VERY good (i.e. Golem in Lord of the Rings) it creates the same disappointment I feel when watching the cheesy animated fireside transformation in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Special-Edition/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(an otherwise excellent movie). If you simply must have CGI in your movie, don't bother to buy this one.

Another objection is that the movie had a poor ending, or that the script didn't faithfully portray the werewolf legend. I take exception to both of these assessments. There are two basic types of werewolf movie in my opinion, the classic and the shapeshifter. What is the difference?

The classic werewolf is a victim, and changes in accordance with the lunar cycle. These changes are painful, unavoidable, and result in a fugue period. After the transformation he is unaware of his rampage and horrified once he discovers it. The resulting inner turmoil is at the heart of the classic legend and the only release is death, hence the obligatory sad ending. As a viewer (or reader) we are supposed to feel sympathy for the werewolf.

The shapeshifter is a different form of werewolf. These guys can change shape whenever they choose. In some stories they can only do this during the lunar cycle, but more often than not it truly is an ""at will"" transformation. They are usually happy with their lot, and relish the power it brings them. No one feels sympathy for this type of werewolf. They are generally (but not exclusively) little more than a common criminal in werewolf clothing, and usually are found in packs -- unlike their classic counterpart who is a loner. The Howling is one of these types of films, as is the follow up to this movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Werewolf-in-Paris/dp/155890848X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Werewolf in Paris</a>. Shapeshifters are very popular at the moment.

An American Werewolf in London is a classic werewolf horror movie with some humor injected. Rather than detract, the humor actually highlights the underlying horror. It is like the uneasy laugh of a boy walking home though a graveyard at night. The script is good, the acting above average, and the special effects still hold up very well indeed. The story takes you from the moors of Yorkshire to Piccadilly Circus in London as you follow David in his journey through lycanthopy. There is plenty of blood, howling, romance, some nudity (another horror staple), and humor.

I heartily recommend this movie if you like the classic werewolf and can live without CGI.",1283472000,,3316,5.4147286821705425

There's also a variety of ""real"" characters.  Most are total unknowns, and all the Brits are definitly natives.  I didn't hear a single immitation accent, or imposter posing as a local.

Released at the same time as ""Cat People"", ""Prophesy"", and ""Wolfen"", this movie has outlived all of them.  Thirty years after the original release it is still worth watching.

2662830,4,B000IONJHE,"I doubt anyone reading this is looking for a plot summary or a discussion of how Rick Baker's effects made cinematic history.  You're here to read about the new material on this disc.

The ""Beware the Moon"" feature IS worth the purchase price alone.  Running 90 minutes, it discusses key scenes of the film in their running order, so it's almost like a video commentary.  It includes funny and fascinating behind-the-scenes anecdotes, as well as tons of ""unused footage.""  I have to say, some of the test shots of the werewolf under construction stalking around the set look even creepier than the finished product.

The only other new feature, ""I Walked with a Werewolf"" with Rick Baker, would have been more enjoyable if they didn't drown out his very soft baritone with needlessly dramatic and very intrusive music.  You have to really strain to hear what he's saying, the music completely overwhelms him.  Someone needs more experience on the mixing board.

The film transfer looks good, if a little grainy, but the sound is crisp and clean.  My only other complaint is with the disc menus.  It's not that big a deal, but I appreciate when disc menus are somewhat in keeping with the feel of a movie.  ""Werewolf,"" unfortunately, uses the same Star Trek-type spaceship interface that worked very well on ""Serenity.""  Here it's just distracting and makes it seem like the disc was slapped together.

In special effects alone, this one is worlds beyond the clumsy film overlaps used to transform Chaney from an upright man to an upright hirsute. Under a full moon, Landis's misfortunate bite victim moans, screams, thrashes, emits guttural sounds and writhes in naked terror as hands and feet elongate into paws, face stretches to a snout, body hair thickens to sparse fur and the newly-born creature loses all bipedal abilities.

We witness this chillingly detailed metamorphosis one time only, and that's more than adequate. Often the stalking monster is represented by a camera looking out from its viewpoint; also effective as we close in on fleeing prey. There's gore, but it's not gratuitous and is used only when necessary. A new element is that those killed by a werewolf are doomed to wander Earth as undeads until the last of the creatures either commits suicide or is destroyed, which is best accomplished by someone who loves the man underneath the wolf.

Simply put: despite a recent CGI-laden version, this well-done, by turns dramatic, humorous and frightening work just may be the werewolf to see. Highly recommended!",1265760000,,1540,5.9324324324324325

The film revolves around a college student who goes on a rampage or three after being attacked by werewolf on a Yorkshire moor. Hairy situations indeed; the film won a Best Makeup Oscar.
  According to those in-the-know, Landis came up with the film's plot while in Yugoslavia working as a production assistant on Kelly's Heroes. He and a Yugoslavian member of the crew were driving when they came across a group of gypsies performing rituals on a man being buried so that he would not rise from his grave.
  Poor dead Michael Jackson said it was this film that he chose Landis to direct his music videos, including Thriller and Black or White.

2662848,5,B000IONJHE,"The first time I saw this movie I might have been 8 years old and I wasn't supposed to be watching and for good reason...it scared me for probably the next 5 years of my life lol.  I have always been a werewolf movie fan (as long as it didn't look too corny and had somewhat of a storyline) and this movie has both.  The special effects were so far beyond anything that had ever been done in movie making and it looked totally believable!  Even as an adult, I enjoyed the movie and felt that it could be released in theaters today and would be able to hold it's own.",1255824000,,566,4.081081081081081
2662849,5,B000IONJHE,"I love ""An American Werewolf in London"". This remains one of my all time favorite monster movies, a fun, crazy mix of horror and comedy. Director John Landis pulls out all the stops on this classic, about two American backpackers, played perfectly by David Naughton and Griffin Dunne who are viciously attacked on the English moors by a savage beast, leaving one dead and the other cursed to become a werewolf.
After that, it's full moons, visits from the living dead, a pretty nurse, and one of the best, most realistic werewolf transformations ever committed to film, courtesy of the brilliant makeup effects guru Rick Baker, who won an Academy Award for his work. For this special edition DVD, there is a great full length documentary on the entire making of the film called ""Beware the Moon"", which is extremely fun and informative. A great film to own.",1255305600,,857,4.797297297297297
2662850,4,B000IONJHE,"By expertly blending humour with gore and suspense, Director John Landis created a unique and instant horror classic with some novel touches of his own. I say this is a ""modern"" classic because I want to distinguish this from the werewolf movies of the 40s, 50s and 60s, which are referenced throughout. This and The Howling, could be considered part of the ""modern"" era of werewolf films.

The story begins with two American backpackers somewhat lost in rural England who, looking for shelter and something to eat, stop by a strange pub. Unfortunately for them, the locals are too cynical to warn them about a local legend that involves (you guessed it) a werewolf. From there things get weirder for the remaining backpacker, David, as he wakes up in hospital and is forced to confront the reality of what happened that night on the moors.

I loved how self-aware the characters in this movie were. From the rural English folk, who didn't think the Americans would believe their legend, to David who continually has to check himself as he is visited by his dead friend, Jack. We see him in gradual states of decomposition as he warns David about his responsibility and tells him that, since he was killed by a werewolf, he must walk the earth as one of the ""undead"" until the curse is lifted.

On top of that, there's a killer soundtrack with songs like Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" and CCR's ""Bad Moon Rising"" punctuating key points in the film.

Even though the creature itself is laughably fake by today's standards, I can't help but say I prefer it to the (even more fake) CG nonsense we see by the bucketload today.
The transformation scene, however, has stood the test of time and, in my opinion, still looks excellent. Landis wanted it to happen in harsh lighting with no cutaways and I think the effort paid off because we see the entire transformation in detail. It's so much more visceral and disturbing than what we get today.

Landis has said that he didn't want this to be considered a comedy (""It's a horror film"", he says in the interview on the disc). While that may be true, I think the legacy of this movie will lie in its wicked sense of humour, something that we'll continue laughing at even after the special effects start to look old and contrived.",1255132800,,2269,4.648379052369077

Hope someone could help me and thank you.",1254528000,,273,4.48
2662853,5,B000IONJHE,"With all due respect to some of the other reviewers, they are obviously not writing about the Full Moon Edition BD, which was issued in 2009.  I'm writing about this specific BD version.

I also own the HD-DVD version and it is quite good.  In fact, several of the extras that are on this BD issue were also on the HD-DVD version.  But with the BD you also get an additional interview with Rick Baker as he talks about his experiences from the making of the movie, plus a documentary titled ""Beware the Moon"".  This latter feature is worth the price of the BD by itself.

So, how's the quality of the transfer?  Pretty darned good, I'd say.  Certainly the best that's ever been available.  It is noticeably better than the HD-DVD transfer and the sound has either been remixed or improved in some way.  The DTS 5.1 sound is perhaps not as good as some films, but it's a lot better than it was on the HD-DVD or standard DVD.

As for the film itself...what can I say?  This continues to be one heck of a ride for the viewer.  Everytime I mention this film to someone, they describe an experience they had when they first viewed it.  (When I received this BD edition from Amazon, I showed it to one of my younger co-workers.  Without any prompting he said, ""I couldn't sleep for two weeks after I saw that on TV."")

What it will probably boil down to is, should you go ahead and buy this Full Moon Edition BD to replace your old HD-DVD or DVD?  Heck, yeah!  What are you waiting for?  It's worth every penny.",1254441600,,1505,4.310714285714286
2662854,5,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf in London is probably the best Werewolf flick since Lon Chaney Jr originally transformed under the full moon.  Sure, the film is almost 30 years old, but with the new high def transfer it's hard to tell.

As an avid DVD buyer my transition to the Blu-ray media has been a little slow to say the least.  I'm generally only buying new titles and am very stubborn when it comes to double dipping on titles I already own.  Some companies take the cheap route and just slap an upscaled transfer onto a Blu-ray in order to make some fast cash.  This however, is completely worth re buying.

I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film was when it was originally released on DVD back in the late 90's .  I instantly fell in love with the movie.  Everything about it was perfect, the humor, the scares, the sfx, the amazing soundtrack.  It's very rare to find a movie that so perfectly combines horror and comedy, a film with characters you truly care for.  This is a movie that sticks with you, one of the better horror comedies, one of the best werewolf films.

The transfer is great, crystal clear.  It's as if it was filmed a few years ago.  The audio has great as well, the film has never looked or sounded this good.

The extras for the most part were transfered over from the original 2001 DVD, but the best extra comes in the form of a feature length documentary called ""Beware the Moon.""  The documentary covers everything from conception, to filming, to the somewhat negative reception it got when it was originally released.

It's a pity more movies don't get the kind of treatment.

Buy this disc immediately!",1253577600,,1637,4.494915254237288
2662855,5,B000IONJHE,"The title of my review is a quote from the new feature length documentary, 1 hour and 37 minutes to be exact, featured on the brand spanking new Blu Ray release of one of the greatest horror films of all time, An American Werewolf In London.  It's fresh in mind, mostly because I just watched it, and because I recently had a debate where someone assumed that if the majority likes or dislikes a film when it comes out that makes what they say so.  Guess not.  This film received poor reviews when it came out.  Most of which revolved around negative accusations against Landis not knowing whether to make a comedy or a horror film.  I guess they never saw Abbot and Costello Meets The Wolfman.

Yes, this is a HORROR film, not a horror comedy.  It's a horror film that happens to be funny.  There's two type of funny horror films: goofy ones without a serious bone in their body, often referred to as splatstick(Dead Alive, Evil Dead II, Return of the Living Dead) and the harder kind, the kind that requires more restraint, the kind like American Werewolf.  See, there are funny bits but they all come from the characters realistically dealing with an absolutely absurd circumstance like, say um, TURNING INTO A WERWOLF!  The trick here is similar to what Shaun of the Dead did.  The characters were funny but the zombies weren't.  They would literally tear you apart and eat you alive in a very graphic fashion.  There were no thriller jokes involving syncrinized dancing undead, or fish out of water timeline gags with talking corpses.  The same applies here.  The werewolf story is tragic, sad, horrifying and deadly.  The scene where the lone commuter is attacked by the wolf in the tube is still one of the few scary werewolf moments ever committed to film.  Not to mention the opening scene on the Moores, which works more so then not due to Griffin Dunne's realistic and terrifying screams of agony as he is ripped to shreds.  Plus, a good thing to do in horror is to make the characters funny.  This lets the audience warm up to them faster, since most horror films don't have the time for Jane Austin levels of character development.  When they're funny and charming then the death, mutilation and terror to befall them works even better.

Of course the Blu Ray transfer is the best this film has looked in years.  The DVD had a huge grain problem.  This Blu Ray does away with most of that but, it has more to do with the lighting and film stock, but it's only there in glimpses and not often.  All the special features are the same as the previously released DVD minus two.  We get the feature length documentary Beware of the Moon: Remembering An American Werewolf in London and I Walked with a Werewolf.  I Walked with a Werewolf is disappointing.  It's only a seven minute interview with make up and creature creator Rick Baker.  He rehashes some things he said in the previous Rick Baker feature from the first DVD, and some of this feature's material is featured in the full length doc.  The only new thing this featurette adds, and this is an annoying add, is innocuous tid bits about Rick Baker's involvment with the upcoming The Wolfman remake.  This is fine and well, but nothing of substance is said.

Beware of the Moon is the most comprehenssive doc ever produced for this film.  Sure, a make up effects and horror buff like myself knows most the info and stories by this point from reading movie books and Fangoria magazine, but it's nice to have for posterities sake.  The biggest focus of the doc is the make up effects of course.  What's really neat is we are treated to some outtake footage of the effects, unused test footage, and behind the scenes pics I've never seen before all thorughout the doc.  This doc starts in 1969 and goes to the film's release.  The whole cast, the ones still alive, are all interviewed, EVEN THE DARK PLAYER FROM THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB shows up!  Now that's what I call thorough.  It's cool getting stories from David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, who seemed to not be fond of his whole make up process.  Dunne's most interesting tale involves the moment he found out the final third of his character's performance would be done by a puppet.  He was not happy and voiced it.  They met him in the middle and let him control the mouth on the puppet.  That's one I didn' even know.  Pretty cool.  Another one I found most intereesting are the stories behind David Naughton's and Griffin Dunne's casting.  Neither had to audition.  For the details just check out the doc.

Besides the Baker and Landis interview from the previous DVD release the other really cool feature worth checking out is the commentary by Dunne and Naughton.  Their reparte' is still there all these years later.  You can really tell why you cared so much for them in the film and their character's friendship just hearing them outside of their roles.  Even if you don't like commentary tracks you should give this one a spin.

The bottom line is, even if you don't have Blu Ray yet, this is worth the triple dip(fourth dip if you count the video cassette for me).  They re-released this film on DVD with the same features as the Blu Ray in a two disc set, so no one can be left out.  Corny I know, but this film is such an influence and never outdone or done as well, with the exception of the forementioned Shuan of the Dead.  This film is a classic and it truly is a very funny and very scary horror film.",1253059200,,5435,4.52
2662856,5,B000IONJHE,"This is the only 5 star Blu I have given that is not a reference quality picture, but they put so much on here I could not avoid it.

The picture quality and clarity were underwhelming, but it still looks better than any of the prior versions. Plenty of artifact, hair, grain and fade throughout but the colors turned out nice, especially the reds (plenty of red in this film). I would have to say it preserves nicely (in a nostalgic way) how we all remember seeing this back in the 80s scaring the something out of us. The DTS rears actually get used but only in the howling sequences, otherwise everything is funneled into the front three channels. But what makes this so worthwhile are the supplements.

The new features with Rick Baker and John Landis are worth the two hours and have TONS of great material (personal favorites include the ratings board clashes, how the screenings went and Baker being interviewed in front of his favorite prop - the whole wolf, still looks so real). The additional features are from the prior releases and include the interviews, making of, outtakes, photos and more. The subs and menu listings are in 18 languages and the film is dubbed into four others. This also has the D-Box Motion Code, BD Live and is laid out in the typical left-feeding Universal menus.

Like I said, not a reference picture or sound, but overall this makes for a great deal at this price. If you only have a couple hours for a rental, at least watch the Beware the Moon (new) feature as each location is visited recently with some great Landis material spliced in appropriately.",1252886400,,1593,4.602112676056338

2662860,5,B000IONJHE,"""An American Werewolf In London"" is an expertly crafted horror classic.  It is one of my favorite werewolf films for numerous reasons:  It was written and directed by John Landis who also gave us the late Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.  Davis Kessler`s (David Naughton) transformation into the werewolf was created by makeup artist Rick Baker who also worked on Eddie Murphy`s ""The Nutty Professor"" and Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes.""  The scenes on the Welsh moors were very eerie and gothic; they were reminiscent of the horror films produced by Hammer in the late fifties to early seventies.  Gorgeous Jenny Agutter of ""Logan's Run"" fame is perfect as the beautiful Nurse Alex Price who falls in love with the horrible beast that is terrorizing London.  Alas, as in so many other films of this nature (such as ""King Kong"") beauty can never have the beast.

  Normally, I don't like humor mixed in with my horror.  However, due to Landis' superb direction, the humor doesn't distract from the horror.  My favorite scene:  When the werewolf breaks out of the porn theatre in Picadilly Circus; mayhem and panic ensue.  ""An American Werewolf in London"" has a high body count that will not disappoint.  It rivals ""The Howling"" - another classic that was released the same year.  Wes Craven's ""Cursed"" - a mystery slasher involving a werewolf - is also recommended.  For connoisseurs of the classic horror films, Hammer's ""Curse of the Werewolf,"" starring a young, dashing Oliver Reed, is a must see.  Also, if you enjoy a lot of violence and gore, ""Dog Soldiers"" may be the ticket for you.

2662863,5,B000IONJHE,"This is a masterpiece of a film by an inspired John Landis who takes a topic done dozens of times before--lycanthropy--and adds a little sauce and spice to the kettle. Here we have a werewolf film with adventure, black comedy, a little flesh [both pressed together and ripped apart to bloody shreds], laughs, ""oh-my-Gods"" and even pathos. This is a great, imaginative, inventive film with superb special effects that you will never forget, as I haven't since I saw it on the screen in 81. Starts off with a couple of young Americans backpacking it through the spooky European countryside at night. Love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcomed like the plague. Both leave the place and are quickly pounced upon by a werewolf with one guy getting mauled to death and the other, the 'he-shoulda-gone places' David Naughton [who plays David] surviving only to become a murdering werewolf. All hell breaks loose thereafter, as David falls in love during the day, kills by night and constantly bumps into his 'back-from-the-dead' backpack companion, Jack--complete with mauled & ripped flesh. Great cringes and laughs as with each of Jack's post-mortem apperances he is more and more deteriorated until, at the end, he is nothing but skull and fascia. The scene in the theatre when Jack introduces David to each of his deceased, devoured victims, complete with gaping holes and missing limbs, is a beaut. The transformation scene where David turns into a werewolf in his living room is absolutely ASTOUNDING and UNFORGETTABLE---this is an all-time classic horror scene. Cheers to the special effects and make-up pros here. GREAT film-making by John Landis with refreshing originality and a marvelous, astute variation on a sterotypic horror theme. Sorry Naughton didn't become the star he should have. If you haven't seen this one you MUST before the next full moon. Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys.",1243987200,,1921,5.00625

The appeal to this film is the combination of horror, suspense, action and humor. The latter actually is the key ingredient because this can become a downright scary movie. The levity here and there is welcome relief. There is just the right amount of contrast between horror and comedy.

For parents wanting to know, there also is a fair amount of rough language and there two sex scenes, one as part of the story and one ""on screen"" in a porn- movie theater where the two male leads meet late in the story.

2662874,5,B000IONJHE,"Hadn't seen this movie in a few years (quite a few) and caught it on AMC just the other night during their Fear Fest '08. I taped it and have been watching it with glee every day too.

David and Jack are attacked early in the movie by a Werewolf, David's life is spared by the patrons of the Slaughtered Lamb pub, but now he has inherited the bloodline of the beast, and is the last one apparently and needs to die in order for all the people he will kill (plus Jack) to cross over to  the other side, as they currently walk the earth in limbo.
Jack wants him to commit suicide, but David seems to think he's going crazy, hallucinating, basically losing his mind.

As many have stated, the tranformation scenes...especially the first time David turns are really good, there is some blood and gore, but it's not anything like in today's movies. Even seeing Jacks's tore up face in the first scene of him as the undead is not too bad, and he's more concerned about his would be girlfriend going off to sleep with some other guy right after his funeral ""love mocks me, even in death"" I believe was the line he used.

To me there are so many funny scenes in this movie. David and Jacks relationship seems to get even better when Jack becomes a member of the undead....I love his lines when trying to get David to kill himself. ""Can I have a piece of your toast?"" And holding up the Mickey Mouse figurine and mimicking ""Hi-Ya, David!"" Plus his increasing decomposition as the movie goes along. The classic porn theatre scene is priceless with all David's fresh kills sitting there decomposing trying to come with ideas on how David should off himself.

David has an insatiable appetite for people when he turns, and for his love interest the Nurse Alex whom he is frisky for throughout. While at the theatre I spoke of earlier he turns into the Werewolf again and this begins the final showdown outside the theatre that has plenty of action and special effects to finish out this classic.

2662877,5,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf In London was a funny, but gory movie that I enjoyed very much, not to mention David Naughton(David Kessler)did a lot of nude scenes in this comedy/horror flick showing off his Manhood, including his wiener and tushy showing David Naughton with even more graphic nudity and even more nude scenes than anyone else in this movie, including co-star Jenny Agutter(Nurse Alex), since Jenny's ta-tas were the extent of all her nude scenes, especially when David & Alex did a couple of sex scenes in the middle of this movie playing the song ""Moondance"" by Van Morrison while David & Alex are doing hubba hubba after Alex takes David into her apartment after David checks out of the hospital in England since David is an outsider and a drifter with no place to stay while Alex falls head over heels in love with him inclining Alex to reel David in like honey attracts a bee, which obviously results in David banging his sexy nurse(Alex)whom by the way becomes his girlfriend before he dies off of course.

The scene where David roams around buck-naked in the forest when he kills and then eats a deer in this film is very similar to the scene where Irena(Nastassja Kinski)roams around buck naked like a bitch-in-heat showing off her Womanhood in the forest for no apparent reason in the middle of the night eating a rabbit alive in the movie CAT PEOPLE.

The special effects in this movie when David transforms into a werewolf for the first time are also marvelous too and so are the bonus materials showing outtakes on what the director and producers had to do to get that transformation scenes correct before they were able to do the theatrical release of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON back in the Summer of 1981.

Additionally, I would have to say that I think AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON was probably David Naughton's best film throughout his entire acting career and this movie was released only a few years after his one hit wonder song ""Makin It"" made the charts back in 1978.

Unfortunately, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON has a tragic ending to it when David as a werewolf ends up getting shot to death in an alley even after Alex(Jenny Agutter) tells David she loves him and then falls apart into tears after changing back into a naked man shot up to death all bloodied up with bullet holes in him, which made it a shame that they couldn't find a cure or any other solution to David's afflicted ability to transform into a werewolf, but you have to admit, David & Alex weren't a bad looking couple and it was quite hard to not admire the intimacy between David & Alex either, which by the way were my favorite parts of this movie, especially when David got Alex into bed.",1219017600,,2699,4.593360995850622
2662878,5,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf in London was one of the first Horror films I saw. I remember hiding in the back room at the age of 5 hoping my parents wouldn't notice what I was watching. I had many a sleepless night due to that film. And I guarantee you that I will never feel safe in a subway.

About the movie:
This is a classic in the werewolf genera, both humorous, frightening, and true to the tragic history of the wolfman. John Landis (of Animal House fame) directed this interesting piece starring David Naughton as David, Jenny Agutter as Nurse Price, and Griffin Dunne as Jack. This is the classic retelling of an old horror film modernized and updated in the special FX area. And while we are on that area can we say breakthrough special effects? These set the standard for monster films up until Jurassic Park showed us the power of CGI. I don't want to give the plot away even though it's a very standard werewolf plot.

There are of course some great scenes in this film, I love the Slaughtered Lamb, no one can watch this scene without feeling uncomfortable.

As far as character development goes, the characters are likeable, especially Jack, but don't develop very much into the movie.

The acting is better than most horror flix, though it won't win any awards, I can't complain that it detracted from the film at all.

The script is quick and well written, easy to follow and hard not to like.

By today's standards some of the creatures look a bit campy, specifically those in the dream sequences. But again there is nothing better than the scene where David turns into the werewolf. And I love the idea of a four legged werewolf. I always hated the idea of a werewolf being a hairy man on two legs.

The film on the DVD is exactly like the one that was out in theaters they claim it is redigitized but I never notice any difference in that.

[...]

The Making of video was mostly a repetition of what was said in the interviews and was again entirely too short.

The casting of the hand was interesting and gave a better perspective on the real personalities of David Naughton and John Landis. It was pretty funny too. I just wish they had added more info on how they used the cast after it was made.

The deleted scenes have no sound to them so it's hard to distinguish why they were included.

I'll admit that I haven't listened to the John Landis voice over yet... after seeing his interview I can't imagine it being more that a poorly written stand up routine. Once I watch it I'll add my opinion on that into this review.

There were pictures and storyboards that I haven't bothered to look at yet since the batteries in my remote died.

My final opinion is to get this movie for the film, not the extra's. They are far too short and insignificant in the whole scheme of what is on the DVD. I personally love the DVD but I won't bother with the extras again.",1214956800,,2875,4.4

The best is Bad Moon Rising by Creedence Clearwater Revival. John Fogerty of CCR wrote 20 rock classics including Proud Mary and Green River.

The one thing that lets this version down is the transfer to HD-DVD
taking into consideration the age of the film (1981 i believe- or there abouts) you'd expect grain- but with todays technology and other older transfers being incredible! This is a disapointing transfer and showed up very grainy on my 1080p tv- especially the moors sections which looked worse than my DVD version!?? (how they managed this i do not know)

2662884,5,B000IONJHE,"David Kessler and Jack Goodman are two Americans taking a break from school and family by taking a three month trek across the English countryside. Wet and hungry they venture into a small country village where they stop in at the Slaughtered Lamb hoping to eat and warm up. They come across some eccentric residents who are anything but warm and are encouraged to leave even though it's late and the full moon is out. Shortly after leaving they venture off the main road onto the moors where they are attacked by a creature of the night.

David (played by David Naughton) is the only one who survives the attack but he's having horribly gory dreams and his mutilated dead friend Jack (Griffin Dunne) keeps coming to him, in various degrees of decay, and telling him he should kill himself before the next full moon. One of the ways David remains sane is hooking up with his nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter / Logun's Run).

An American Werewolf in London was written and directed by John Landis who also directed the movie Animal House and Michael Jackson's Thriller video. It was filmed entirely in Wales, London and Middlesex, England. This is one of the best horror movies of all time with incredibly detailed make-up effects by Rick Baker that still hold up for today's viewers. Baker set the standards for future monster movies.

I love the music too. It's addictive. Probably because there are only three songs throughout: Bad Moon Rising (Creedance Clearwater Revival), Moondance (Van Morrison) and three renditions of Blue Moon (Sam Cooke, The Marcels and Bobby Vinton).

This is one of my favorite all-time movies. There's comedy (a bit campy at times), there's blood and guts, there's wolf lore and there's a white guy running around in his birthday suit in the middle of the London. I've seen this film dozens of times and enjoy it every time. It's a must see film for horror buffs and werewolf fans. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.",1198454400,,1936,4.735905044510385

I loved this movie from the moment it started.  Seeing me beautiful and peaceful scenery at the opening of the movie really got to me.  I know that all these horrible events were about to take place and seeing the serenity that opened the movie created at ""wow"" factor for me.  (As you've probably figured out by now, I'm really big on contrast in a movie.)  The characters are ""real"" in the sense that you an feel for them and sense the agony and passion throughout the movie.  I'll admit that I jumped twice in the movie.  To me, this is an indiction of how into the movie I am.  Yes it's a cheap scare but if I'm analyzing a movie going ""this is wrong.  that's wrong"" then I'm not going to jump when whatever comes out of the closet.

My only complaint with this movie is the ending.  I don't mind where it stops per say but it's more the instant jump to the credits with the happy and up beat music after something so sad just happened.  (I refuse to put blatant spoilers in my reviews!)  I'm all for contrast but (as stated above) but this just wasn't the place for it.  Let me have my ending and digest it before forcing me to move onto a new emotion.

2662886,3,B000IONJHE,"This film establishes mood excellently in it's first hour.  Rainy english moors, edgy locals, the american boys who don't belong there.  David Kessler (David Naughton), surviving a werewolf attack that claims his friend's life, finds himself in a hospital w/a sympathetic ear from Nurse Price, as disturbing dreams signal he is now the werewolf and the countdown to his transformation and eventual killing spree has begun.

The film succeeds brilliantly in this buildup. It's tense, then abruptly lighthearted and comic, and back again.. back and forth as the dream sequences get more horrific- it's perfect.

Then the crescendo... the transformation.

Oof.  These makeup effects may have dazzled in the early 80s, but not so much now. Someone might have taken a tip from Rob Bottin, who kept his makeup transformations somewhat unlit.. as in the Thing, whose effects have held up remarkably well. The intent here was to really show the transformation, but less would have been more.  And the werewolf just looks like a werepig, really.

So, jaded viewers, scares turn to giggles and it's downhill from there.  A killing spree, populated with characters with no story arcs at all.

2662887,4,B000IONJHE,"I had heard about this movie for years, but I had never watched it until recently. The main reason was that I don't really care for Werewolf movies that much. Theres so many of these films, its usually the same basic story every time, the effects usually aren't good, and to be honest, I just don't find the whole Werewolf concept that interesting or scary at all. But with this film, I had always read rave reviews about it, especially about the special effects in it, so since I found it cheap, I went ahead and purchased it. But there it laid on my shelf for many weeks before I did finally take the plunge and watch this classic werewolf tale. Again, I wasn't expecting to fall in love with this film, but I gotta say, I really did like it. And though the film does have comedy in it, its well balanced with scares as well. Usually comedy in horror films is something I don't want to see, but this film knew its limits, and I feel that it never went too far in doing that. Yeah, this is basically the same old werewolf tale, but modernized in a very good way. The story is of a American traveler David Kessler backpacking through various parts of Europe when him and his friend are attacked by a werewolf. His friend is killed, and David is bitten but saved. David soon discovers that he too, will become a werewolf during the next full moon, and that anyone who is close to him, is in danger. The special effects in the film are quite good for its time, and the transformation sequence of David first changing into the werewolf was undoubtedly the most impressive. But only did I like the special effects, I enjoyed the scenes with David and his ""undead"" friend Jack, who appears throughout the movie, each time looking more and more decomposed, who repeatedly warns David about becoming a werewolf and what he must do to stop it. Yes, I know, those are comedic sequences, but for some reason, I liked them. It was something different and fresh. After all, who many times do you see zombies/ghosts in the same movie with werewolves, and it actually work? In fact, a lot of people call this film a comedy horror, but I disagree. This is definitely a horror film just with some comedic elements added to the mix. This DVD has some pretty good special features including a commentary by cast members, a short little featurette, and an interview with director John Landis. In closing, I've seen my share of werewolf movies, most of them aren't that great in my opinion. Need I mention the horrible sequel ""American Werewolf in Paris"" or the crappy Wes Craven film, ""Cursed""?? Indeed, this film has been the best werewolf movie I've seen so far. (I don't know if that saying a lot, though!) I think its done in a clever way, and it has a good balance to it. If you are a big fan of these movies, then I'm quite sure you've long since viewed and purchased this one.

This is the only movie I've ever seen people run shrieking out of the theater from, three teenaged girls who had been sitting behind us, delighted at the idea of being scared until the werewolf attack on the moors. I know our friend's wife(the Joan Crawford fan) wanted to join them...lol.
  I loved the blend of humor and horror, and using the various ""moon tunes"" to highlight what was happening was fantastic, especially during David's first 'change'. Everyone is right, this is the best transformation of any werewolf film, then and now, and congrats that they won the first ""Make-up Award"" for it at the Academy Awards the following year!
  Griffin Dunne _should_ have won an Oscar for being the best ever ""dead best friend"", but I also wish they had done a better job on Jenny Agutter's role. She's quiet an actress but was given little to do here besides looking worried and afraid. David Naughton is the perfect bumbling  college boy suddenly become werewolf, he really comes across as truly flustered trying to figure out what has happened to him and his friend and how to deal with it.

2662893,5,B000IONJHE,"For a longtime this was my favourite film of all time, its not anymore, but it is still a genuine classic film, that deserves a place amongst the greatest horror films ever made.

The reasons for this are threefold:

Firstly the special effects by Rick Baker are amazing. Remember this was made 25 years ago, there was no digital effects then, what you see on the screen was either done with make-up or animatronic puppets. Rick Baker won an Oscar for his work on this film in 1982.

Secondly the blend of horror and comedy. If you watch the extras you will hear the director Jon Landis state that the film is not a comedy, although he admits it is funny. Some of the scenes are very funny and this comedy, sometimes black comedy works really well against the horror in the rest of the film. The horror in this film is brilliantly done with the double nightmare sequence being a particular favourite of mine.

Thirdly of course its a love story. The ending to the film is ultimately all about the love story, but once again John Landis confuses our emotions by immediately playing The Marcels great version of Blue Moon over the end credits.

The scene in the Slaughtered Lamb is a direct reference to the multitude of classic Hammer Films that featured a Pub that went silent went our hero entered it. You will spot quite a few well known faces in the Slaughtered Lamb including a fresh-faced looking Rik Mayall.

The extras on this edition are pretty good, with both Rick Baker and Jon Landis having some interesting things to say. Perhaps the most surprising was that Jon Landis wrote the script for this film in 1969. There's also some fascinating stuff on how Rick Baker created the amazing special effects.

2662894,5,B000IONJHE,"When people talk about this film, many speak of the classic transformation scene.  Yes, it was an amazing achievement of special effects.  Don't let that distract you, however, from the fact that this was a highly intelligent take on the werewolf genre.  David Naughton is excellent as the american student come werewolf, and Griffin Dunne almost steals the movie as the gradually decomposing, but generally pleasant, corpse who continually reappears to his friend.  There are classic campy jokes (e.g., when David tries to get arrested as a form of protecting others from his werewolf alter ego) as well as real drama, and an excellent supporting cast including Jenny Agutter who combines great acting and classic beauty.

2662895,5,B000IONJHE,"OK, I couldn't resist that pun . . .

That said, I have loved this movie for years.  Two American boys are hiking across England when they end up at a mysterious inn on a full moon night.  Despite warnings, they decide to keep going and get lost on the moors.  One is horribly killed (this is a gory, gruesome movie - not for the faint-hearted!) and the other . . . survives.  Once he awakens from his coma, he moves in with his sexy nurse and begins to see the badly decomposing corpse of his friend following him around, telling him to kill himself before it is too late.  As the bodies pile up, the corpses following him around become quite a group (this is the darkly funny part - I love the dead people - yeah, I'm a sick ******)

Like all traditional werewolf movies, this one ends badly (as in sadly); I always feel SO sorry for werewolves - they have a terrible lot in life.

2662902,5,B000IONJHE,"Written and directed by a young John Landis, this 1981 release was a hit and rightly so. It is a smart, sharp, scary, and ultimately satisfying horror flick with a dash of romance tossed into the brew. Boasting a young and energetic cast, it succeeds brilliantly in what it sets out to do: entertain.

David Naughton (I'm a Pepper; you're a Pepper) is terrific as a young American backpacking along the moors in Northern England with his friend, played with comic deftness by Griffin Dunne. They are advised to stay on the road and off the moors. When they come upon a strangely named roadside in, they stop in for refreshments, only to get a very odd and funny reception upon their arrival. Feeling unwelcome, they decide to move along, but not before being told once again to keep to the road and off the moors.

Though they are able to see the road, as there is a full moon, they carelessly wander off onto the moors. No sooner do they do so that they start to hear the baying and howling of some creature. Scared and realizing that they have wandered off the road, they start running for it, when suddenly ""it"" is upon them, killing Griffin almost instantly before attacking David. David is saved by those very folk who had made them feel unwelcome in the inn. How they do it makes for a great scene.

The unconscious David finds himself waking in a London hospital several weeks later, remembering that he and his friend had been attacked by a viscious wolflike animal, a story at odds with what the police had been told by the local villagers. David begins to have some disconcerting dreams and visits by his now dead friend, who claims to be part of the undead. David, who thinks he is going crazy, is looked after in the hospital by an interested doctor, played by John Woodvine, and a lovely and caring nurse, played by a very young Jenny Agutter. David and Jenny happens to fall in love and upon his release from the hospital, he goes and stays with Jenny in her apartment. It is there that, during a full moon, David experiences what he has become.

What happens next is both frightening and, at times, humorous, due to the wonderful script penned by Landis. The doctor, intrigued by David's claims that he was bitten by a wolf like animal, coupled with a bizarre series of murders where the victims are found half eaten, travels to where David had been attacked and discovers the same roadside inn, where he encounters a reception similar to that which David and Griffin had received. Returning to London, he sets about trying to help David. Meanwhile David is himself confronted by what has happened, though he has no recollection of having done anything. What transpires next, however, will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.

This is a great horror film, well acted by the entire cast. The special effects won make up artist, Rick Baker, the first of his six Academy Awards for special makeup effects (Star Wars, The Nutty Professor, Planet of the Apes, Men in Black, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas).

2662905,5,B000IONJHE,"The Werewolf sub-genre is one that has suffered over the years from poverty row production values and destructive self mockery. Like the Zombie, the Werewolf is the poor relation to the endless tales of vampirism and Frankenstein. This is mainly due to a lack of generic tradition in literature and art, but Hollywood has done little to redress the balance over the years. However for a short time in the early 1980's the Werewolf enjoyed the fullest of moons with both Joe Dante's HOWLING and John Landis' AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON thrilling audiences and winning important critical notices. Landis had scored with ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS, and deftly combines the ribald humour of those films with all the horror clichs that had undone Universal's output in the 1940's. Importantly Landis's humour is not mocking, instead he gives us an affectionate parody, overflowing with enthusiasm. He is also very aware of the conventions and limitations of the genre itself. The scares and violence come in abundance as does the nonsensical narrative twists. England is both beautiful and eerie, a space in which the age old battle between science and superstition continues to be played out. The film works because of its lack of originality, through its post-modern appropriation of Universal's themes and iconography we have an early example of a horror homage. Wonderful special make up effects by Rick Baker however firmly anchors the film in modern horror seas. Full of excellent British character actors, the nostalgia of the film is pitched perfectly and represents the high watermark of Hollywood horror films for the 1980's.

Universal's 2 disc DVD is misleading. The supplementary features amount to little more than 45 minutes, and the DVD could have easily been presented on a single disc.",1156809600,,1807,5.14625850340136

But this movie is about more than special effects. It is directed and edited in a way that keeps you off-balance. You find yourself laughing at talking, decaying corpses. You find yourself on the edge of your seat while following a businessman through the narrow passages of the London tube. You find yourself pulling for a protagonist who ultimately can only have one solution to his problem.

Anyone who is familiar with the story of the werewolf will find this movie easy to follow.  What makes this movie different (if not unique) is its successful union of comedy and horror.  The humorous sequences are funny enough to laugh at while the gruesome scenes have the power to shock.

As a brief synopsis, two American students David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) are on a walking tour of England and attacked by a werewolf.  Jack is killed but David is only bitten and mauled.  David is taken to a hospital and while there develops a relationship with a nurse (Jenny Agutter).  David eventually encounters the ""undead"" Jack who tells David that he will become a werewolf and that he must die in order to release him from his curse of being one of the undead.  David has difficulty accepting this but does indeed become a werewolf who kills people.  (The human David can't remember killing people.)  The movie ends on a tragic note at London's famed Piccadilly Circus.

What makes this movie especially appealing besides its comedy-horror aspect is that we identify with David whom we hope will find some way out of his impossible predicament.

This movie has everything: laughter, hate, love, drama, and horror (gore) as well as violence, nudity, sex, and profanity.  Beware that this movie is not for the squeamish!

The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Naughton effectively carries the movie.  Seeing Dunne come back to visit his friend in various states of decay is hilarious!  (David calls Jack a ""walking meat loaf."")

The special effects are great.  They were so good that the movie won an Academy Award for Best Makeup.

The background music is interesting.  All songs have the word ""moon"" in their title.

The legal disclaimer in the movie's closing credits reads ""Any resemblance to any persons living, dead, or undead is coincidental.""

The only problem I had with this movie was its abrupt, anticlimactic ending.  It was truly a letdown when you consider that the entire story was so absorbing.

Finally, the DVD (Collector's Edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are several extras, all interesting.

In conclusion, if you want to laugh and be scared, then this is the movie to see!!

2662909,4,B000IONJHE,"'An American Werewolf in London' is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, and is also one of the very few ones which actually works as a horror film.  Overall the humor is perhaps more important than the horror, but most horror-comedies don't take themselves seriously at all.  The film has a bizarre, unsteady tone, and the humorous and horrific elements are often juxtaposed unexpectedly, which will doubtless aggravate many.  Frankly, it doesn't really have much particular drive much of the time either, but the individual scenes all play nicely enough that it all still works.  Also, it's got some of the most awesome practical special effects of all-time.  Definitely one of the most worthwhile werewolf movies of all-time.

The film opens with two young American, David and Jack, hitchhiking across the English moors, and eventually entering a pub ominously named 'The Slaughtered Lamb'.  The locals are rude and distant, so they eventually wander off into the night.  Turns out this wasn't such a wonderful idea, and that the locals did indeed have good reason to be in a bad mood:  There is a werewolf on the prowl, which attacks David and Jack, and is then dispatched by the locals.  Jack is killed but David survives and is hospitalized.  That's just the beginning, of course, and we all know what happens when you're bitten by a werewolf.

Again, the film doesn't have an overwhelming amount of narrative thrust.  We have the setup, then David basically sits around for a while and falls in love with the nurse, Alex, there are some  amusing and strange dream sequences and eventually David turns into a werewolf leading to the final climax.  Still, we've got some fun stuff going on.  The film is rarely, ya know, laugh out loud funny, but it's consistenly amusing and clevr.  The best humor involves the mangled, gradually desiccated corpse of Jack who comes to David repeatedly, telling him to kill himself.  He's got most of the best lines, and is very nicely played by Griffin Dunne.  He's a humorous character, but not with out a certain menace.  David Naughton is good in the lead, your standard average everyman type character, but likable and believable enough.  Unlike many horror movies, humorous or otherwise, Landis really tries to get you to like the major protagonist, and succeeds, so the film has got a lot more human interest than a lot of horror films.

The movie becomes a fair bit darker and more violent in the climax, though they certainly don't abandon humor entirely.  The transformation scenes are still extremely impressive today, and I do not doubt that they would've caused your head to explode back in '81.  The werewolf itself is less impressive, but I've seen a lot worse.  The major stalking/killing scenes are sharply done, and, again, played almost completely straight.  The ending is, perhaps, slightly anticlimactic, though it is nicely chaotic, with numerous car crashes and whatnot.

Yeah, I'm done.  A weird movie, but I like it.

2662914,4,B000IONJHE,"American Werewolf in London made John Landis a top director of the 1980's. Landis updated the classic werewolf tale to present day.

David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are a pair of American tourists hiking though the countryside of Britain.  It's late when they come to a small Welsh village.  The villagers are all on edge. When the boys unintentionally alienate them, they are cast out onto the moors.  They are attacked by a beast, leaving one dead and the other recovering in a London hospital with a beautiful nurse by his side and the decaying ghost of his friend visiting him.

When the next full moon occurs, he goes through a metamorphosis.  After a killing spree, he wakes up nude in the London Zoo.  (Very funny sequence on how he gets out of there.)

The next night it happens again with a wild finale in Picadilly Circus.

This film knows how to alternate between funny and scary.  It's a real rollercoaster ride.

2662915,4,B000IONJHE,"This is one of the first horror movies where the make-up and transformation effects were truly frightening and realistic, even though we've certainly come a long way since this 1981 cult favorite.  Director John Landis has helmed a whimsically humorous yet terrifying vision of the standard werewolf movie.  Originally chastised for its extremely violent climax in Piccadilly Square, this movie still remains a pretty effective thriller.  David Naughton eschewed his Dr. Pepper background as the young American who survives a werewolf attack only to find he is destined to become one.  Griffin Dunne as his friend Jack is fun as his deceased friend who comes back in varying degenerative stages to try and convince Naughton to kill himself lest he does more killing.  Lovely Jenny Agutter and austere John Woodvine offer fine support, but it's really Rick Baker's marvelous makeup that steals the movie.  The movie spawned a less effective sequel set in Paris.  This one is the best though.",1131235200,,990,5.15
2662916,5,B000IONJHE,"I was obsessed with werewolves when I was in second or third grade.  Something about them just fascinated me.  (Ironically, I was also terrified of wolves)  In second grade, I was determined to see ""An American Werewolf in London"" as soon as possible.  It sounded like a great movie.  After about three years of begging, my father finally allowed me to watch it.

The film begins with two college students travelling through the English countryside.  After a bizarre encounter with the locals at a pub, the boys stumble on to the British moors during the full moon, where they are attacked by a giant wolf.  Three weeks later, David (Naughton) is in a London hospital and Jack (Griffin Dunne) is dead.

John Landis, who wrote and directed this film, is famous for his great comedies, such as ""Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"", and ""Kentucky Fried Movie"".  People expecting the constant humor of those films may have been disappointed with this was released.  This film has humor - some parts are quite funny - but it's not a huge part of the film.  But the film maintains a light tone throughout most of that film, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.

David Naughton is very good; he makes many of his scenes very funny.  Griffin Dunne was a great choice; he makes a very believable, cynical young man.  Jenny Agutter, Naughton's love interest, is beautiful and a fitting casting decision.  John Woodvine and Brian Glover are very good in their roles.  Paul Kember was very likable and amusing as Sergeant McManus.  ""Muppets""/""Star Wars"" fans will enjoy a brief appearance by Frank Oz.

The soundtrack is very good.  (Trivia fact: every song in the film contains the word ""moon"" in the title)  Elmer Bernstein's score - what little of it that there is - is excellent and at times beautiful.  It's a pity that a soundtrack CD was never officially released.

Landis' direction is great, but it's Rick Baker's effects that are really spectacular.  The werewolf transformation is rivaled only by that of ""The Howling"".  ""The Howling"", which was released before this film, had special effects by Rob Bottin, whose mentor was Rick Baker.  I think it's neat that Baker did the effects for this film and did such an outstanding job; it's almost like he was reminding Bottin who was the student and who was the mentor.  The Academy Award for Best Makeup was created specially for this film, and for good reason.  The transformation scene is masterfully done (Sam Cooke's ""Blue Moon"", which plays during the scene, was a perfect choice - it really enhances the mood).

When I first saw ""An American Werewolf in London"", I thought that it was very likely the best werewolf movie ever made, and I still believe that.  It's a well-made, very entertaining movie with some spectacular makeup work.  Beware the moon and stay off the moors, but don't worry about picking up this wolfishly good movie.",1131148800,,2892,4.781818181818182

2662919,5,B000IONJHE,"David Kessler and Jack Goodman are two young Americans backpacking through Europe, just trying to have a carefree, good time. On a particularly chilly night, they find themselves wandering across an English countryside and getting pretty desperate for shelter, when they come across a pub called ""The Slaughtered Lamb."" Not deterred by the graphic advertisement, inside, they find the pub is really quite cozy and atmospheric. Fellows are playing darts, having a game of chess, telling politically incorrect yet totally hilarious jokes... Everyone seems a bit disturbed at first sight of the two American travelers, but things warm up once they are accepted as being completely harmless. That is, until Jack asks the forbidden question: ""What's that star on the wall for?"" The two young men are quickly turned out into the cold without an answer. If only they had known, but the only information they were given was a bit of advice: Beware the moon... and stick to the road. But these are two carefree American boys just looking for a good time. They're not worried about things like...werewolves! After only walking a short distance, the boys have wandered off the road and onto the moors, and only a few moments later, they are being circled by something horrible! The fog is too thick to see, but before they can react, the beast has attacked! In seconds, Jack Goodman is ripped to shreds! His friend David is running in fear! He stops to think for a moment, then runs back to help is already dead friend. Now, David is the one being slashed at, but before the creature can do his worst, a shot rings out and it's all over.

David wakes up to find himself in a London hospital 2 weeks later, desperately searching for his less fortunate best friend. He is cheerfully informed of his situation by the stern but benign Dr. Hirsch and the short-tempered American representative, Mr. Collins. But when David insists that it was a wolf that attacked him, he is treated less than respectfully. It seems to have been confirmed that it was an escaped lunatic that did the damage to David and Jack, and no one is interested in hearing otherwise. David is frustrated, and his new animalistic nightmares aren't helping, nor are the ones involving nazi were-creatures, but his mood is lightened as he is distracted by a lovely nurse named Alex Price. Alex is equally infatuated with David, and the two grow closer by the day, despite David's apparent mental state. You see, while having breakfast one morning, David had a visitor: his friend Jack; his DEAD friend Jack. The purpose of his visit was to warn David that he would transform into a werewolf at the next full moon, and if he doesn't want to hurt anyone he must take his own life. When David is finally released from the hospital, his next stop is Alex's flat. The young pair indulge themselves in each other, but all is not well with David, who is plagued by repeated visits from his increasingly decaying friend. Soon, the full moon is upon him, and David's moment of truth has finally arrived.

In 1981, John Landis put his own spin on Universal's ""The Wolf Man,"" and the result was a new classic for werewolf fanatics everywhere. The story is very familiar. A young American travels to England and gets bitten by a werewolf. He falls in love with a local girl, but their romance is interrupted when he grows convinced that he will become a werewolf himself. He finally transforms, reeks some havoc, and commits some murders. He becomes a sympathetic character as he expresses his fear and guilt over what he has done, but soon he transforms again and is finally killed, the film ending as suddenly as his life. With the brilliant look of its werewolves, Rick Baker's masterful effects (thankfully, CG free), and the genius of John Landis, ""An American Werewolf in London"" brought a realism to the werewolf genre that is reminiscent of the olde legends and lore. No silver bullets or fully dressed lycanthropes here! Many call this film a horror-comedy. Well, it's definitely more horror than comedy, despite what you might hear. It doesn't have any more comedy than one would find in the real life of an average, young American male. It's just so honest that it's funny. I was in London last New Year's, and they DID have Dart competitions on TV! As for horror on the other hand, this movie's got it. You may not find the film scary at first, but try taking a lonely, nighttime walk after viewing it. I've always found the subway scene particularly disturbing. And what can one say about the cast? Simply perfection. David Naughton plays the American werewolf superbly, from carefree traveler to suicidal lover. Jenny Agutter is lovely and sympathetic, Griffin Dunne is funny yet convincing, and John Woodvine is the Doctor you hate to love. Brian Glover is disturbingly suspicious, and who can forget the cast of ""See You Next Wednesday?"" *ahem*  It all adds up to one of my favorite motion picture experiences!

A sequel was released in 1997 called ""An American Werewolf In Paris."" CGI effects, a few confusing plot points, and zombies that were more annoying than funny marred the final product, but overall it was still a highly fun viewing experience, despite all its criticism to the contrary. See it and judge for yourself. Some say it's not a legitimate sequel because the story has nothing to do with the original film. I've heard conflicting theories though. Some sources have stated that the female lead in ""AWIP"" is supposed to be the daughter of David Kessler and Nurse Alex Price. Intriguing and highly possible, even probable, but it's never stated outright in the film, so I'm still waiting for some official word on that.

No matter how you feel about the sequel though, the original ""An American Werewolf In London"" is a must own for the werewolf or horror film fanatic! This DVD edition, which is the first release (and the only version I have at the moment) offers nothing more in the way of extras other than the theatrical teaser trailer, though I found it to be very cool and scary. For a better viewing experience with plenty of extras, pick up the newer and very affordable collector's edition release. I certainly intend to!",1129248000,,6205,4.773743016759776
2662920,5,B000IONJHE,"John Landis's ""An American Werewolf in London"" is Red in tooth and claw, and goes to show that even a man who's pure of heart, and says his prayers by night, may turn into a snarling hell-hound that boogies down to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Bad Moon Rising"" while tearing up yuppies in Kensington and uptight bankers in the London Underground---all when the wolvesbane blooms and the Moon is shining bright, of course.

Made in 1981 (a great year for movie Lycanthropes on both sides of the Atlantic) Landis's ""American Werewolf"" is for my money the greatest werewolf movie ever made, and coincidentally marks Landis's directorial high-water mark.

While backpacking across the UK, and shortly after a pit stop at the way less than 5-star Inn of the Slaughtered Lamb, American college buddies David Kessler (the underrated David Naughton) and Jack (a cheeky Griffin Dunne)are attacked by a mysterious beast on the moors.

The dimly glimpsed beast tears Jack's throat out and savages David, who is hospitalized and London, cared for by a pretty English nurse (played with sexy restraint by Jenny Agutter). Tormented by increasingly horrific dreams and plagued by ghoulish visions, David soon realizes that he has problems far worse than the cancellation of his summer-long EurailPass.

""An American Werewolf in London"" has long been regarded as a comedic horror film, and it's not hard to see why. The title is campy and glib, the film itself has a cocky and sarcastic air about it, and the dialogue between the increasingly Lupine David and his inreasingly ghastly revenant friend Jack is wickedly, blackly funny.

But ""American Werewolf in London"" is not a funny movie; it is far more of a classic evocation of the black, wild terror you feel when you find that the hungry, uncontrollable beast that stalks the night and slakes its thirst with the blood of innocents---is you. Landis, who had a fine touch for the comedic and strong sarcastic flair, uses funny barbs and witty dialogue to heighten the mounting horror of David's plight.

Landis has created a work of sheer, diabolic genius, channeling the stuff of pure nightmare: think of the stalking scene where a City banker is pursued by something---something too awful for the camera to show, we feel---through the anonymous, antiseptic, endless tube-like passageways of the London Underground. From the moment we hear the snarling, coughing bark coming from the darkened tunnel to the second some brutish thing comes slouching upon its cowering victim, we have left the world of film and entered the world of nightmare.

Rick Baker's special effects are outstanding: the prosthetic and gore effects are so shocking, so gruesome, and so organic that the film (especially on the crisp Special Edition transfer) looks like it could have been made yesterday.

But when all is said and done, the real credit for this masterwork comes back to Landis. Here is the work of a director in the prime of his career, finely balancing comedy with terror, wielding a mean and unsympathetic camera, and willing to take a chance. Those inured to its shocks from having watched the film hundreds of times may not realize what an insidious, subversive little piece of grue this is, but think about it: Landis zigged where a lesser director would have zagged, and the result is the stuff of nightmare. Where did those squealing Nazi pig-soldiers come from, anyway? I don't know, but thanks to Landis they have been regular guests in more of my nightmares than I can remember.

Dreamy, surreal, hysterical and terrifying, modern and classical at once, ""An American Werewolf in London"" is the greatest werewolf film of all time, and a fitting meditation on the Beast within.

2662921,5,B000IONJHE,"""An American Werewolf in London"" was the first horror movie I saw in my life. I guess it was in the end of 80s and I was thrilled then. As was I about ten years later when it unexpectedly came in my hands. Immediately I decided I had to possess this flick because I thought it's a movie for ages. And till now I haven't changed my mind. ""American Werewolf"" is a real horror film in all the meaning of this word and it has the right amount of humor (""Mom, a naked american stole my balloons""). There are some sequences which I consider classic - this is what a true horror movie should be like (I'm talking about the sequence with a werewolf attack at moors in the beginning or about the subway scene or ingenious episode where the main character is chasing a deer in the forest). ""American Werewolf"" looks rather frightful although sometimes it seems John Landis didn't have such an intention. It seems the movie was supposed to be ""horror"" only in quotes and indeed to be fun. But the creators achieved more than they expected - one of the best contemporary (well, I guess we still may call it contemporary) horror films was born.

The make up is a whole different story. If someone tells you he saw a better man-werewolf transformation scene than in ""American Werewolf"", don't believe this person, he's lying. I have never seen better and I have seen a lot. It's amazing how nowdays they try to make everything with computer graphics and fail because we can always tell the difference between a living person and a computer one. Why don't they just return to good old make up? What Rick Baker (who got an Academy Award for this film) did is absolutely astonishing. Now, 25 years later the transformation scene still looks awesome, I can't figure a single detail which seems out of place. I repeat: there's no werewolf movie which can top this one as far as make up is concerned. Just ""Howling"" (which by the way was shot also about 25 years ago) was very close but still...

""An American Werewolf"" to my opinion is the best werewolf movie ever and one of the most notable horror films in general. So I guess it's a must for every cinema fan. Besides this edition has a very interesting ""making of"" featurette.",1128384000,,2211,4.497512437810945

2662926,5,B000IONJHE,"PLOT: The film opens on the moors of northern England. Two vacationing Jewish-American college kids, David Kessler (David Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne), are traveling on foot. By nightfall, they reach the small village of East Proctor. They stop at a local pub named ""The Slaughtered Lamb."" The sign features a painting of a decapitated wolf's head on a pike. ""Where's the lamb?"" asks Jack. The two walk inside and the villagers immediately go silent and stare at them, as if they were freaks or something. They sit down and the barmaid takes their order. They ask if she has anything like hot soup, coffee, or hot chocolate. ""We have spirits and beers. If it's something hot that you want then you could have tea,"" she replies. The two quickly order the tea. Jack looks on the wall and notices an old drawing of a five-pointed star surrounded by candles. ""Maybe the owners are from Texas,"" suggests David. After the villagers start talking amongst themselves again, Jack identifies the star as a pentangle. ""It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney Jr., in Universal Studios maintained that's the mark of the Wolf Man"", he states. Jack builds up some courage and asks why the star is on the wall. The room goes dead silent. A dart playing villager points at the boys and states, ""You made me miss. I've never missed that board before."" David and Jack, now realizing that they are not welcome, decide to get going. The barmaid yells out, ""Wait! You just can't let them go!"" The rest of the villagers just say, ""Go. Stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors. Beware the Moon, lads!"" The two start walking down the road, hoping they'll find an inn or something. As soon as they left, the villagers started debating over if they should have let the two go or not. It soon starts raining and the barmaid says, ""Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain."" Suddenly a blood-curdling howl is heard. The barmaid starts pleading, ""We must go to them!"" ""I heard nothing,"" replied a chess-playing villager. The rain doesn't last long and David and Jack suddenly hear the howling. They immediately get scared. They look up to see a full moon and remember what the villagers said about bewaring the moon and sticking to the road. They look down and notice that they accidentally wondered off the road into the moors. The howling starts getting louder and they decide to retrace their steps. They soon realize that they are really lost and they sense that the large howling creature (whatever it is) is circling them. The two start running in a random direction, hoping that the howling sound will start to get far away. Suddenly David slips and falls. Jack leans over to help him up and a huge hellish beast attacks him from out of nowhere. David runs off to save himself, but Jack's calls for help make him feel guilty and he soon runs back. Suddenly the beast attacks him. David then hears the sound of guns firing. In a dazed stupor, he looks over to his side to see a dead naked man. He then looks up to see the villagers examining him. Then he blacks out. He awakens in a hospital in London three weeks later. Upon awakening, he is greeted by Dr. Hirsch (John Woodvine). He informs him of where he is and that Jack is dead. Two Scotland Yard detectives inform David that he and Jack were attacked by an escaped lunatic, he was shot by the local police, and that there were two witnesses at the attack. David immediately states that he and Jack were attacked by a wild animal (not a man) and that there were no witnesses. He suggests that the villagers of East Proctor are trying to hide something. Everyone just thinks that extreme trauma has clouded David's memory. While in the hospital, David has realistic nightmares such as one in which he is running naked in the wilderness and another bizarre one in which wolfen Nazi storm troopers murder his family. On the bright side, David is also finding himself drawn to his sexy nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter); she also finds herself drawn to him. One morning while eating breakfast, David looks up to find himself face-to-face with a rotting Jack. ""Can I have a piece of toast?"" he asks. David goes into shock. Jack informs David that the two were attacked by a werewolf on the moors. Since Jack was killed, he has to wonder the Earth in limbo as one of the undead. Since David survived, he is now a werewolf. In order for undead ones to be freed of their limbo, the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed. Jack pleads for David to kill himself or he'll make others undead. ""Beware the moon, David,"" he says. Then he disappears. David now realizes that the true horror is only about to begin.

COMMENTS: John Landis' An American Werewolf In London is an awesome film and arguably the best werewolf film ever made. Landis wrote the screenplay in 1969, and saved it for when he became a famous director. He later started a friendship with Special EFX genius Rick Baker. Rick Baker designed the ape-man in Landis' 1973 low-budget film ""Schlock."" Landis told Baker about his plans for AAWIL, but at the time no one exactly was banging down Landis' door for him to make it. Immediately prior to filming this, Rick Baker served as the special effects consultant on Joe Dante's classic werewolf film ""The Howling."" He must have gotten an idea or two while working with EFX man Rob Bottin. Landis wanted his film to be about a tragic werewolf, basically a modern update of 1941's ""The Wolf Man"", with Lon Chaney Jr. Baker wanted to design a bipedal werewolf like the ones from ""The Howling"", but Landis wanted his werewolf to be a quadrupedal hound from Hell. What Baker ultimately created was arguably the scariest werewolf in the history of cinema. Landis also wanted the transformation scene to be in harsh, bright light. A transformation scene in a dim room, like in ""The Howling"", is a lot easier because the dark can hide whatever flaws are in your makeup and EFX. Bright light shows everything. Baker managed to pull it off. This was also the first werewolf film in which the transformation is depicted as an extremely painful metamorphosis, with bones cracking and everything. Baker's transformation work was absolutely amazing. No more cheap lap dissolve tricks from films like ""The Wolf Man."" This also predated CGI and it shows that a realistic transformation scene can be done without it. I am not a big fan of CGI werewolves. The horrid sequel, ""An American Werewolf In Paris (1997),"" was done with all CGI werewolves. I think that they look like ridiculous cartoons. Baker's animatronic puppeteered suit looks awesome the way it is. Baker later became the first Oscar winner in the category of ""Makeup"" for this film. Many people expected this film to be a comedy, since Landis previously scored success with 1978's ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" and 1980's ""The Blues Brothers."" Audiences were in for a big surprise. Some people call this a horror comedy. Landis states that this is not a horror comedy and that it is a serious horror film with some humorous moments. Every song on the soundtrack has the word ""moon"" in the title. This film is a timeless horror classic. I would recommend this film to anyone. The new collector's edition DVD is awesome. The picture and sound have been completely remastered and it is presented in its original widescreen theatrical ratio. It also features outtakes, storyboards, photograph montage, production notes, cast bios, archival footage of Rick Baker casting a mold of David Naughton's hand, commentary w/ David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, a 1981 documentary entitled ""Making An American Werewolf In London, and brand new interviews with John Landis and Rick Baker. If you really love werewolf films, then buy this DVD as well as the special edition DVD for The Howling. Check out my reviews for The Howling, Howling II, and Howling III DVDs as well.",1123113600,,7851,4.7223032069970845
2662927,4,B000IONJHE,"With the exception of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"", this is the greatest work director John Landis ever produced. This comedy/horror hybrid is fast paced, brief and to the point. Alternating between producing genuine frightening moments and real eroticism (the use of Van Morrison's ""Moondance"" during a steamy sex scene is sheer genius) while allowing subversive imagery (the Jewish in-jokes are really a Jungian buffet of dark humor), and genuine organic laughs, Landis (WEREWOLF being unlike the rest of his work) uncannily finds a way to create a lusciously loaded and layered film with economy and precision.

Much has been written about the Rick Baker special effects and they are truly stunning and there isn't a hint of CGI to be found. The famous transformation scene is the best of the werewolf sub-genre as it is well-lit and performed with Sam Cooke's golden throat silking through ""Blue Moon"" on the soundtrack.

The leads are capable, likable and evoke empathy- a rare feet for a contemporary horror film. Jenny Agutter, one of films great underappreciated  female leads, lends her usual strong, sensual support.

Celebrating the classic horror film while also gently spoofing it, Landis creates a contemporary horror/comedy classic hybrid that improves with each successive viewing.",1116892800,,1297,5.374384236453202

Two Americans are wandering along the moors of Wales when they're attacked by a werewolf. Jack (the horny comic relief sidekick) is killed and David (the slightly mature frat boy type) awakens after 6 weeks in a coma in a London hospital, under the care of a hard boiled doc and a sexy nurse.

David begins to lose his mind when Jack shows up in sporadic visits, decomposing as he goes along. As a victim of the werewolf Jack is ""undead"" as in dead, but unable to rest, just like all the victims of this werewolf's line.

He urges David to kill himself and end the curse, freeing all the victims.

David does not and the first night mauls what appears to be an accountant in a Tube station amongst other victims. He wakes up naked in zoo cage with other wolves. He goes back to the nurse's flat and they have wild monkey love.

The next night he goes nuts and kills more people, including a clueless couple who are quite amiable when they meet him in the afterlife.

The third night undead Jack lures him into a porno theater with the saddest fake prono in the background. David transforms into the ugliest wolf you've ever seen in the theater and after killing everyone in it, escapes into the crowds of Lodnon town. Chased down an alley his only hope for salvation is the quasi-sympathethic London nurse who appears to be using him for sex.

Also they say the movie is funny its not i only got a laugh out of it because of the thought the main female character had had sex with a werewolf besides that its boring. Seriously i love werewolf movies don't get me wrong but the werewolf in this film more looks like an over inflated hairy balloon with legs and a dog mask, it's nearly as bad as the bald, over sized annerixic hampster of a werewolf from Harry Potter 3.

The tending nurse falls for him while the doctor trusts the sincerity and looks into the events.  But the full moon quickly rises and all concerned begin to realize that something is very definitely wrong.

The werewolf is a classic tragic monster and this film maintains that tradition.  No one asked to be a werewolf and they did not get that way through their own actions.  But this is not a typical werewolf film.  There is a higher degree of characterization and interaction than is usual.

2662936,4,B000IONJHE,"Updated Review: March 2015

Two young Americans, David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are attacked by a massive beast one dark, foggy night while back-packing in the English moors. One is killed, the other is sent to the hospital. David, the survivor, is then plagued by disturbing, violent nightmares brought on by his near death experience. Soon his dead friend Jack begins re-appearing (in various stages of decomposition) informing David that they were attacked by a werewolf and if he doesn't kill himself soon, he will become one himself. David does not believe his dead chum and dismisses his claims as rubbish. That is of course until that night ..  when the moon is nice and full and things start to get a little hairy.

Next to ""The Howling"", this werewolf spectacle is one of my favorite horror movies. It's a great mixture of horror and humor so even if you hate fright films, you may find something to like here. The film's cast is impressive. It doesn't have any world famous superstars, although many are respected, accomplished actors in their own right, and they all give good performances. Jenny Agutter, who you may recognize from films like ""Logan's Run"", ""Child's Play 2"" and a gazillion others (check out her IMDB page), plays the female lead and the werewolf's love interest. She is good here and lovely to look at (love the accent BTW) while Griffin Dunne, son of the late Dominick Dunne and the brother of the late Dominique Dunne of ""Poltergeist"" fame, is hysterical as the walking dead friend given the difficult task of tormenting his buddy. David Naughton's portrayal of the tormented David is really effective and he shows us considerable range here ranging from a charming, comedic performance to dramatic. You also have to give kudos to a man who has no qualms of running around buck naked in a park while stealing balloons from a confused child (a boy that seemed to have leaped out of a European comic strip). But despite the film's impressive performances, the real reason to see this film is for its ingenious special effects. No CGI monsters here folks, instead we are rewarded with several creative transformation scenes and a ferocious, three dimensional monster. The transformation scene is especially spellbinding (again, no CGI) and it qualifies as one the greatest werewolf (many would argue that it is the greatest) transformation scene ever captured on screen. The beast is not clearly shown until the final frames of the film so during those earlier attack scenes, the camera acts as the beast's eyes (POV), and the overall effect is chilling. The subway scene for instance, never fails to send some serious chills up my cowardly spine. Like most horror films (at least the good ones), this one saved the best for last and a major highlight is the spectacular climax in Piccadilly Circus. Once the beast is unleashed upon the people of London, all hell breaks loose and this is where the film goes completely off the rails. The over-the-top violence escalates for a few brief but heart-pumping moments, never letting go until the end.

""An American Werewolf in London"" along with Joe Dante's ""The Howling"" (1981) remain the best werewolf themed fright films. Although they differ in setting and tone, both can continue to bask in their glory since no werewolf themed horror films released recently (throughout the 90's and beyond) have been able to surpass their brilliance and creative genius. Some say ""Dog Soldiers"" is a worthy addition to this genre but the rest rely on far too much CGI therefore losing its effectiveness. Do flat CGI werewolves look realistic to anyone? This film is a classic. It's tongue-and-cheek horror done splendidly with one of the fiercest werewolves ever captured on film. It will tickle your funny bone while making you quiver in fear and the ferocious, hairy man-beast tormenting the friendly people of Britain is worthy of your praise. Get it.

There are a couple of DVD versions of this film out there so buyer beware. I have an earlier version purchased over a decade ago. The cover is blue and showcases the werewolf, in mid-transformation, as the cover art. This edition does contain some bonus materials, however the transfer is not great. In all honesty, it sucks. I am no expert in picture quality but this was made apparent to me when I recently viewed this in my friends HD TV; the sub-standard picture quality and sound were exposed in all its blurred, sub-standard glory. This newer version,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Werewolf-in-London-Full-Moon-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002HWUU9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Werewolf in London (Full Moon Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] is a better option in terms of sound and picture so make sure you get that one instead.

2662937,5,B000IONJHE,"What ever happened to horror movies using good ole special effects instead of fake ass CGI.  This film contains some of the best special effects ever in any film, and still stands up being over twenty years old.  This film and ""The Fly"" are my favorite horror films ever.  Whats cool about this movie is that it's got it's intense freaky parts as well as being hysterical.  When the main character calls his buddy Jack a ""walking meatloaf"" I laugh my ass off every time.  And the mass hysteria and widespread panic that occurs in the end of the film is equally disturbing and funny.  I think it is a send up of old slapstick humor actually.  It's great when a horror movie can take itself seriously and not take itself seriously at the same time.  John Landis is an amazing director who some how did something totally original with this classic retelling of the werewolf tale.  It takes balls to walk that fine line between humor and horror, most of the time directors fail at achieving the middle ground between those two things.

2662938,5,B000IONJHE,"Many of the horror/sci-fi movies of the 80's look outdated today in an age of CGI and non stop action sequences. I'm glad to say that AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is one of the few films of that era and genre that holds very well even today. At the core of things is the good story: 2 american boys on a hitch hiking holiday across northern Europe where they ultimately find their fate. One thing that stands out is the dialog: it's not some over dramatized sermon; it actually sounds like the type of things two young guys would say given the film's situations. By doing so, some of the scenes come off as ""funny"", but I wouldn't say this is a ""comedy"", even though it was directed by comedy maestro John Landis (Blues Brothers, Animal House). When the violence gets going it gets pretty ugly, even by today's standards. The Special FX (by Make Up Guru Rick Baker) earned this film an Academy Award. The movie moves at a nice pace and it never gets boring, something that, sadly enough, did not happen in the ""other"" werewolf movie, THE HOWLING, who despite this, was another landmark in Special FX.

The DVD contains the vastly superior DTS sound, which will make this a joyride. The DTS mix is loud and proud and makes every tiny detail stand out. Also of mention is the crisp and clear video transfer, a vast improvement over the VHS version.

You will do no wrong in owning this film. Not only it is an important history lesson, but it's also one hell of an entertaining horror film.",1099785600,,1490,4.454212454212454
2662939,3,B000IONJHE,"There's a lot to like about American Werewolf in London -- and just as much that's aggravating and disappointing.  Apart from David Naughton's thin performance in the lead role, the acting is solid, with Jenny Agutter the standout as a pretty young nurse who's a sucker for animal magnetism.

The film snaps from comedy (some of which works, some of which doesn't) to fairly realistic gore -- with nightmare scenes that give the entire story a sense of the surreal which is fairly unusual in a mainstream film.

The story is short and highly simplistic -- with little depth; the twists and turns, such as they are, simply don't engage.

2662940,4,B000IONJHE,"""An American Werewolf in London"" is an excellent homage to the classic horror films.  It is an ambitious combination of scares and dark humor.  John Landis, fresh from his successes with ""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"", definitely brought a fresh modern twist to the genre.  Primarily, this is a horror film but Landis delivers a dash of black humor usually in the person of the decomposing corpse, Jack, played by an excellent Griffin Dunne.  The British cast(Jenny Aggutter, John Woodvine, and Lila Kaye) deliver top-notch support.  The make-up effects, particularly the transformation scenes, designed by Rick Baker are still jaw-dropping to this day.  David Naughton, of ""Dr. Pepper"" commercial fame and the TV disco sitcom, ""Makin' It"", as the title character gives me a little pause.  He doesn't give a bad performance, just an average one.  The gore, particularly toward the end of the film, was just a tad excessive.  Those reservations aside, I highly recommend this film to those with strong stomaches.",1098748800,,1020,5.170731707317073
2662941,5,B000IONJHE,"There are a couple of things that have stuck with me over the years since I first saw American Werewolf in London. First, the opening on the moors of Wales (""Keep off the moors ... Stick to the road"" has always been good advice, and I can't resist adding ""it'sa cold and'a wet out here"" at the conclusion of hearing or singing Santa Lucia). [probe] Second, I'd never before seen anything like the werewolf transformation - I don't think I've seen much that rivals it since, either.

The rest of the movie was sketchy in my mind until I got the DVD, so there were still a few good scares and surprises in store for me. The laughs are more amusing than the out-loud laughs of John Landis' Blues Brothers or Animal House movies. Jack (Griffin Dunne's character) absolutely makes the film, being simultaneously very funny and very gross.

The werewolf movie has always been the odd-duck of Hollywood horror films. Dracula is all evil, all the time. Frankenstein's monster is woefully misunderstood. But the werewolf is a combination of the two, and it takes a good storyteller to find the right balance. For the most part, Landis is successful in capturing that duality in American Werewolf in London. Brief scary scenes are intercut with longer character exploration scenes, so moviegoers can really identify with David's (David Naughton's character) plight. The ending is overly brief, but I don't think it could have been extended without becoming maudlin.

As far as the bonus features go, the commentary is a bit weak. While Naughton and Dunne have great chemistry in the film, there are long silences on the commentary track. At times it seems they're caught up in watching the movie and perhaps somebody has to poke them with a stick to keep them on task. The fact that Dunne is absent in about half the film doesn't help matters, since there's less for him to comment upon. If Jenny Agutter or John Landis had been in on the screening I expect the commentary would have been vastly improved.

The rest of the bonuses are fairly good, although the soundtrack-free outtakes and the overlong ""casting of the hand"" segments are yawners. Some of the interviews ""spoil"" the scares, so my recommendation would be to watch the movie before the bonuses. The Script-to-Scene DVD-ROM feature is very nice (I had to click ""view full screen"" and then click on the movie while it was playing to get the feature to work properly; it was well worth the effort, though).

If the werewolf movie is the rarest breed of horror movies, then American Werewolf in London wins best of show (as it has thoroughly ripped the throats out of all competitors). It's scary yet provides a good plot; it's funny without being a spoof or satire. Not a typical Landis film in terms of comedy, but for top-notch movie-making it's among his best.",1096588800,,2814,4.746421267893661
2662942,4,B000IONJHE,"I first watched this move in 1984 at age of 12, and the comedy elements to this movie were lost on me at the time - it genuinely terrified me to the point of hiding behind pillows. Now after viewing it again 20 years I managed to watch the whole thing. The movie has aged very well and well worth watching. It is still very scary throughout and also will make you laugh out loud.

Plot wise, it is an old fashioned horror move updated to modern times (well updated to the early 1980s !). Its about 2 young guys who get lost on the Yorkshire moors, they stumble into an old English Pub full of suspicious locals who obviously have something to hide. Eventually feeling unwelcome our heroes leave the pub and end up walking across the moor when they hear a wolf howling. Needless to say the wolf attacks and one of the heroes ends up in London where he ultimately learns (and accepts) he is a werewolf.

Some of the special effects are unfortunately a little dated. In particular we only really see parts of the wolf at a time and when we do it more resembles a grey over size sheep than a giant werewolf. No doubt, if done today on a big budget we would have full close ups on a computer generated wolf will a full set of wolfish facial expressions. Nonetheless the transformation scene is very well done, possible the best ever done in the history of werewolf movies - both from a special effect and an acting perspective. All the actor needs to do is scream as one would when becoming a wolf, but he does this well !

The extras on the DVD are well worth watching. The actor's commentary is okay but the interview with John Landis on the themes and inspiration for him making the movie is brilliant and worth the 20 minutes - but watch it after the movie. The interview seems to have been taken 20 or so years after the film and it is interesting to see his pride and still apparent enthusiasm for this move and the genre. He describes a cool story from Yugoslavia which triggered the story as well as going into the background of a few scenes.

While there are laughs, the final movie is pretty gloomy - all werewolves are ultimately doomed (there is nothing that can be done) and our hero is no exception. But the final scene of chaos around Piccadilly Circus is more slapstick that scary.",1094601600,,2292,4.348130841121495

The only movie I have EVER seen that can top that is Rob Bottin's amazing work in John Carpenter's ""THE THING."" John Carpenter is great, isn't he? Halloween, The Thing, The Fog, Christine, I love that guy. ANYWAY, this movie kicks so much ass, and the humor fits right in. And I must say that nurse is EXTREMELY hot.

2662945,2,B000IONJHE,"I read all the positive reviews for this movie; I saw a segment of the transformation sequence.  So I went out and rented it.  Now let's get a few things clear first.  I'm a HUGE fan of Werewolf and Horror films, and I think that people should avoid the use of CGI and computer generated effects whenever possible.  I also hate the majority of modern bubble gum horror films I.E. Scream I know what you did last summer, Etc.  So with the Reviews and Ratings for this classic flick from the 80's and absolutely no CGI, I  felt I couldn't pass this one up.

And for what went wrong...

Yes, the Transformation sequence is AMAZING simply put.  And the humor put in with the film fits it well.  But the thing that drags the movie down to a 2 star rating is that at the end, I felt that very disappointed.  Not that it was depressing or anything, but by the end, it felt incomplete, I didn't care and I felt that I could have rented/watched something better.  Nothing came out of the experience of watching the movie.  I wasn't on the edge of my seat.  The acting while good enough, wasn't great and at times is very bland.

And the scene of the first werewolf attack is laughable.  It's the head of the dog being maneuvered by 1 guy.  And due to the camera angles, (in that scene) it looks cheesy, dark and poorly done.  I have seen the behind the scenes footage for this on an HBO special.  The werewolf in its final form looks more like a small black pathetic dog than anything else.  And what is with the Guy's nightmare with the Nazi (?) werewolves barging into his home, and shooting up the place, etc.  My friend and I were laughing so hard at its randomness and stupidity.  While the film may have been good at it's time.  And it's still worth checking out for the 1 good transformation sequence.  It doesn't work as well anymore.  If you want to see a Good werewolf movie with good acting and leans towards the Goth side a little more, I suggest renting Ginger Snaps.",1091404800,,1971,4.319672131147541

Although there had been humor in horror films before this movie, ""An American Werewolf in London"" showed once and for all that having comedy in a horror film didn't mean that the film would lose out in the scare department. Landis makes it clear that the film is NOT a comedy -- the horror scenes are carried with dead-seriousness and shocking impact -- but there is so much quirky humor surrounding these scenes that the film becomes incredibly likable and buoyant. Most of the laughs come from seeing the old movie werewolf premise dropped into the modern day and watching the characters try to deal with it.
Actors Griffin Dunne and David Naughton, neither of whom had been in a movie before, create a wonderful 'ordinary guy' feeling to their characters of two young American boys backpacking through Europe. In rural England, they have a nasty encounter with a legendary monster, and Naughton faces the consequences of being bitten when he returns to London and takes up living with a pretty nurse (Jenny Agutter).
The transformation scene is justly famous and a milestone in visual effects. Make-up wizard Rick Baker lets the viewers watch a real-time twisting of a human body into a wolf shape: limbs stretch, snouts pop, hair grows, the body contorts...it's amazing to watch. (And on DVD, you can watch it over and over and over again). Even computer graphics can't achieve an effect as startling as this one.
This DVD offers some nice extras. The image is good, and the 5.1 Surround Sound is decent (although there's not a lot of back speaker sound). Actors Naughton and Dunne do feature commentary on the film, and provide some interesting information and sound as if they were having a great time reliving the experience. I wish that Landis had been on the commentary as well, but you can hear his thoughts on the film in an 18-minute interview. Landis is an absolute hoot to listen to; the guy is as funny as his movie, and he absolutely bursts with ideas and observations. To go along with the Landis interview is an 11-minute interview with make-up maestro Rick Baker. He provides a fascinating look at crafting what he calls ""the coolest werewolf film ever made."" Also included is a vintage featurette on the making of the film, although it's only about five minutes long (but you get more of wise-cracking John Landis), ten minutes of archival footage of Baker making a cast of David Naughton's hand, and an assortment of storyboards, outtakes, and production photos.
""An American Werewolf in London"" is a major turning point in horror films and visual effects -- and even over twenty years later, it is still one of the most entertaining movies of its decade. It hasn't aged at all, and this DVD lets you experience it the way it should be seen (and in the company of wild-man John Landis!)",1089676800,,3262,4.847670250896058
2662947,5,B000IONJHE,"There's this scene in An American Werewolf in London where our protagonist is having a conversation with the decomposed corpse of his best friend while watching a pornographic movie in an adult theater.  There are others in the screenroom that eventually reveal themselves to be victims of our tragic werewolf.  Why are they here?  To convince the poor man to commit suicide.  ""You gotta kill yourself, man.  Tonight's another full moon.""  He then proceeds to change into the beast and terrorizes the movie theater.
I bring this one scene up because it had a profound effect on me when I first saw this at eight years old (I know, I know...an eight year old shouldn't have been watching this).  I had never scene anything as twisted before and I've rarely seen anything like it since.  That's the most important thing about this film.  It has never been successfully imitated.
Two American best friends are backpacking through England when one night on an lonely road out in the old country, they're attacked by a vicious creature.  One man dies, the other receives near-fatal injuries.  After a brief stay in the hospital, the protagonist is taken in by his lovestruck sympathetis nurse.  The visions of his deceased best-friend begin to haunt him delivering a terrifying prophecy:  On the night of the first full moon, you'll become the creature that attaked you.
______________________________________________________
I recently saw what I consider to be a disaster of a movie...Van Helsing.  I bring this up because of the interesting werewolf transformation in the film.  The werewolf would convulse and then proceed to rip his flesh from his body revealing the monster underneath.  All of this was done photorealistically as CGI.  But with all the realsim, it still doesn't have the impact of the first werewolf transformation in An American Werewolf in London.  But why?  Are we desensitized as movie-goers?  Personally, I think it comes down to style.  Modern filmakers are too obsessed with how real their effects look that they've become lazy convinced that the realistic CGI will be enough to satisfy the audience.  They've forgotten how easy it is to creep someone out.  Modern special effects should inhance the atmosphere set by a monster...not replace it.",1087603200,,2270,5.075675675675676
2662948,5,B000IONJHE,"I'd read that the impetus for AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON started in the former Yugoslovia in 1969.  A young John Landis was working on KELLEY'S HEROES and saw a burial at the fork in a road straight out of an old Transylvania movie.
He wrote his werewolf movie, but it went nowhere until Landis hit it big with ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS.  He then took out his werewolf script called (as the story goes) AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, a take off on the Gene Kelly musical, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  When the French didn't cooperate with locations, the setting was changed to London.
That's what I'd read.
One of the things that makes this film so special--other than the lean writing and the (at that time) eye-popping special effects--is how it manages to be both funny and scary.
How often do you find that?
I met John Landis at a film festival recently and he's very modest about his films.  He shrugs off ANIMAL HOUSE and WEREWOLF, sometimes referring to them as ""my dumb little movies.""  I'm just Joe Schmo Fan but I hope he someday realizes how great those films are.  Hollywood is STILL trying to make lightning strike again like it did with ANIMAL HOUSE and how many horror movies can you count that strike such the exquisite balance of AMERICAN WEREWOLF?  (If you bring up the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, then you've already lost the argument).
As far as the extras on the DVD, I was disappointed by the actors' commentary.  Too many dead spaces.  As much as Landis loves to talk about movies, I'm still wondering why he doesn't do commentaries for ANIMAL HOUSE and AMERICAN WEREWOLF.
He did an excellent commentary for KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE with Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers.
What young American boy, especially the space cadet nerd, didn't have a crush on Jenny Agutter after LOGAN'S RUN and AMERICAN WEREWOLF?
(One last little note: the film also makes great use of London locales.  Picadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, the London Underground, etc.).",1086480000,,1984,4.708092485549133
2662949,2,B000IONJHE,"The movie is great (4 stars), the extra stuff not.
- documentary: ok, but not too exciting. It more advertises the movie than giving a behind the scene look. A couple of interesting facts, but that's pretty much it.
- 2 interviews: good, but short (15min + 10min). This is the best feature on the DVD. (without these interviews my rating would have been 1 star)
- 3 behind the scenes technical effects: boring, for 10 min we see how to make an armcast.
- 4 commentry: this is the worst commentry, I've ever listened to. Firstly, there is not much talking. Over long stretches, one of the actors may announce the name of an actor we haven't seen beforehand, without giving any further info. And this happens every 5 minutes. Now and than (every 15 min) there is an about 3-4 sentence long communication between both actors, but mostly it's not very interesting. 1/3 of the whole dialog both actors discuss how hot the main actress was. A complete waste of time listening to this...
- 5 extra footage: without sound, and can be given a miss.
- 6 5.1 digital surround sound: Don't expect much difference from the stereo recording.
From a 21st anniverary edition I'd really expect more. If you can find a cheaper non-special release, get that instead. You won't miss any of the bonus features.",1079827200,,1289,4.608695652173913
2662950,5,B000IONJHE,"This is one of the few movies that have consistently given me nightmares since I was a child.  It is at least a decade ahead of its time.  Most of the negative criticisms that I have read use the word ""uneven"" a lot.  Even Roger Ebert, whom I admire, claimed that the humor and the horror were an uneasy mix.  This was years before he gave the movie Scream a positive review.  Now I LIKE the movie Scream, but there is no way that one can claim that it gets the balance right whereas Werewolf gets it wrong.  Scream simply benefits from occurring in the cynical nineties - Werewolf suffers from being avant guard.  .
The new DVD has a few good extras on it - especially a new interview with Landis.  Even after all these years, the film still holds up.  Unlike most films, I see more things in it the more I look.  What, for instance, is up with the townsfolk of East Proctor and what is their relationship with the original werewolf?  My guess - they brought it on themselves somehow.  Maybe one of their own ran over a gypsy and was cursed.  Instead of killing the bloke, they all decide to hide beneath the pentangle in The Slaughtered Lamb every full moon.
I am recently returned from England and this movie is listed in Fodor's as one of the films that best showcases London.  I heartily agree.  I visited the infamous tube stop at Tottenham Court Road and it still looks much the same as when the David made his kill there.  And as I walked, alone in the countryside, beneath the light of the full moon, I had to ask myself, ""Am I crazy?""  Fortunately, I made it to the pub.  There I waited, beneath the pentangle, for my friends to walk me home.",1074297600,,1652,4.29126213592233
2662951,3,B000IONJHE,"John Landis crafts an enjoyable piece of horror hokum, a tongue-in-cheek werewolf thriller that gives an affectionate nod to the old horror movies and also manages to deliver a few scares.
The title says it all: The mainstay of the film's humour, at least for the first half, is the irony of an American finding himself in England. The jokes are as much a poke at American perceptions of England as jabs at Englishmen themselves, from the class-riddled consciences of the native characters (they are all either inferiors or superiors) to the grim, rural northerners (""Don't go out on't'moors"" -- and we all know what happens next).
Special effects were pioneering, and still look pretty good today. Naughton transforms spectacularly into an actual wolf, albeit a pretty hefty one, rather than the half-wolf/half-man of an earlier era.
The soundtrack helps with the irony. Watch out for the alluring Jenny Agutter. If Amazon allowed half-stars, I'd have added an extra half to my three. Entertaining, if macabre, stuff.",1073779200,,1018,5.1017964071856285

2662954,5,B000IONJHE,"Hollywood werewolves have long been characterized as serious creatures who lope after their victims like an hirsuit Groucho Marx.  The image of this loping werewolf was originally etched by Lon Chaney and succeeding generations of actors merely continued his style.  But with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, director John Landis not only pushed the werewolf back down on all fours so it would resemble nothing less than a bristling mobile lycan tank but he also added a much needed touch of humor to force viewers to stand apart momentarily from the gore to contemplate what they had just seen.  David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans backpacking their way through a gloomy English moor right out of Heathcliffe's WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  They are attacked by a howling werewolf who kills Dunne but merely bites Naughton before it itself is shot by villagers.  This introductory scene in which Naughton and Dunne are banished by an unfriendly group of pub drinkers is an unsettling mixture of creepy fear leavened with biting wit.  It is precisely this same melding of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engage in extremes of emotions that range from laughing to choking, with the viewer sometimes not sure which one to choose.
Jenny Agutter is a much underappreciated actress who shines as a nurse who falls for Naughton, and cannot understand a radical change in his eating habits as he increasingly comes to prefer his meat extra rare.  Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that in another and less competent director's hands might have relegated her to little more than a fetching piece of English eye candy.  Griffin Dunne supplies visceral humor as a corpse that keeps popping up, like Hamlet's father's ghost, at opportune times to remind Naughton that the price to pay to be free from lycanthropia may be a tad too high.  And then there is the music, played in much the same vein as Simon & Garfunkle's lyrics from THE GRADUATE, but here Credence Clearwater Revival's lilting ""Bad Moon Rising"" punctuates the eye popping transformation scenes that a bad moon leads to bad vibes.  Finally, the special effects of Rick Baker are stunning in that you can see bones elongating, fur sprouting, and nostrils stretching as Naughton is seen scaring himself as much as the audience.  Ultimately, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is a ground breaker in the werewolf genre in that sight and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way as their victims are in their own.",1067644800,,2513,4.931279620853081
2662955,4,B000IONJHE,a werewolf movie surely a classic of horror and effects. the transformation of David Naughton turning into the werwold if surely horrific and painful. the chase scene in the subway is great and at the end with the adult theater is electric. the beginning with the vast land and the nice touchs with the rain are highlights,1066348800,,322,4.666666666666667
2662956,4,B000IONJHE,"I wasn't really looking forward to watching An American Werewolf in London, but the film has gained a strong cult reputation over the past two decades, and that was enough for me to give it a shot. For the most part, the film is deserving of its rep. Werewolf movies are pretty rare these days, finding a good one is even rarer. And even though AWIL wouldn't overall qualify as a great film, the fact that it's among the best of its subgenre is a good implication of the lack of quality evident in movies based around lycanthropes.
David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are two American friends on vacation in the hills of England. One dark and foggy night, they're attacked by a werewolf, Jack is eviscerated while David is only injured. He awakens in a hospital, put under the care of pretty nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), whom he quickly finds himself attracted to (and vice versa). But the day he's to be discharged, he's met by the undead spirit of Jack, who informs David that he will turn into a werewolf during the next full moon, and will proceed to go on a killing spree. The only way he can end his torment is to die, an option David is not willing to accept.
The opening scenes, set in the hills of England, display a quietly creepy atmosphere (which would be evident throughout all of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie ever made) that gets the film rolling to a good start. Surprisingly, once the movie settles into its London setting, it doesn't lose momentum. This is thanks mostly to the budding romance between Naughton and Agutter, which is really sweet and believable. The two also share one of the steamiest love scenes I've seen.
Naughton is very likeable as the cursed young man, infusing his role with youthful energy and vitality. Because of his performance, it's hard not to find his dilemma distressing and even poignant. Agutter is excellent as David's new love, taking what could have been a cliched role and shaping it into a focused and layered performance. No one else makes much of an impression, except maybe Griffin Dunne as the ever decaying, undead Jack.
Much of this movie's fan base stands behind it because of its humor. But to be honest, except for a morbidly funny scene inside a porno theater (involving David talking to all his victims), I didn't really get much in the way of laughs. Who knows, I may have to give the film another look to get all the jokes, but An American Werewolf in London feels like it mostly wants to be taken seriously, and director John Landis packs in enough tense and suspenseful moments to make it work as such.
The most famed aspect of the film is David's transformation, a scene that show off Rick Baker's superlative make-up work. However, not as impressive is when the werewolf actually moves about while stalking and attacking its victims. A couple of scenes are obviously nothing more than a bunch of f/x guys waving a furry animatronic wolf head at would-be victims, not exactly effective when it comes to evoking pure, shuddering terror.
The abrupt ending is initially bothersome, but further thought has convinced me that to continue with the film after the final scenes would have been unnecessary and probably less emotionally effective.  This is one superb horror thriller.",1064620800,,3291,4.713541666666667

2662960,3,B000IONJHE,"As someone raised on the classic Universal monsters I had high expectations for AWIL.  Sadly, few of them were realized.  AWIL does have the most powerful, eyepopping jawdropping transformation scene in the history of film.  Also, the star does a competent job of portraying the anguish of his position.  Aside from that, this movie is quite forgettable.
For one thing, once the transformation is complete we have a ""werewolf"" that looks like a carpet with big teeth.  Second, there is little originality in the basic plot.  The ""story"" is basically a countdown to an ending you can see a mile off if you have ever seen a werewolf movie before.
AWIL commits one unforgivable sin, however; it just isn't scary.  Oh there is the occassional startle, but no real horror is generated anywhere.  A great deal of this lies in the film's ""humor.""  While the there were a few funny gags the bottom line is the director clearly did not understand how to make a horror movie, so he went for a dark comedy hybrid.  The result is too repulsive to be funny (Hey look, that ghost has skin flaking off him, what a riot) and too inane to be scary.  While it may be a nice diversion on a Friday night, AWIL is not a classic.",1059523200,,1207,4.516129032258065

The results are much more frightening indeed.  While by today's standards the wolf may look tame, the transformation sequences and death scenes are very tense.
  And Landis, who dirceted many of the National Lampoon movies, doesn't forget to add in a healthy dose of humor here and there, and it works quite well.  The movie is somehow both very scary and very funny.

2662966,4,B000IONJHE,"Having been released the same year as ""The Howling,"" one would think one of those films would be remembered and the other sink to oblivion.  This has not happened. Both films seems to have their devotees, and I myself think that ""American Werewolf"" is the stronger film of the two. This film held my interest from the first few minutes and never let go. The blending of the old Welsh village inflicted by a curse with the carefree, American college students having a fun holiday works very well.  The tension at the strange, hostile Inn and the moody cinematography greatly enhance the mood. I can't think of many situations that would be more terrifying than being stranded on those dark moors while an unearthly howling gets closer.  I would have been content to have the film stay in the highlands rather than moving the action to London.
Once we get to London though, we, like the characters, play a waiting game to see how long it will take for the transformation of David to occur and for the carnage to begin. There are many great moments in this film, and the scenes when the wolf stalks his victims are not only terrifying but admirably restrained as well.  I do feel that the climax of the film, set in London's Piccadilly Circus, does get a bit too graphic and bizarre, but I suppose this was mainly to show the chaos that most likely could occur were a werewolf to suddenly pop out seeking food.
The performances in this film are decent. Griffin Dunne is funny as Jack, dead and undead and Jenny Agutter does what she can with the thankless role of love interest whose sole purpose seems to provide sex and material comfort for David. David Naughton does an okay job, but at times, his acting range is a bit limited and he seems to be about the only person who seems pretty unaffected by what is transpiring.  (Another neat trick is to close your eyes when Naughton reads his lines and you'd swear you were listening to David Schwimmer.)
It wasn't until recently that I saw this film (having been a scaredy cat 9 year old in 1981 whose parents wouldn't let him see R-rated movies anyhow), and it wasn't until watching the film that I realized the title was a nod to Mark Tawin's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."" It doesn't hurt either that Twain's book is explicitly mentioned in the film also.
""An American Werewolf in London"" is an enjoyable, thrilling and terrifying film that will keep you laughing even as you hide under the covers.  Good stuff.",1052956800,,2476,4.577878103837472

There are some cool shock scenes too, but that would be telling.  Some cute English girls don't do this movie one bit of harm, either!

Which, given the general attitude of the townsfolk, seems perfectly reasonable.
Anyways, I'd never seen it, I'd never heard anything about it when I watched it. It's funny and gross and silly, and I love the music. (Is there a soundtrack? ""I seeeee a baa-aad moon risin'..."") I recommend it to werewolf & horror fans everywhere.",1035676800,,606,4.672897196261682

2662973,5,B000IONJHE,"""An American Werewolf In London"" is one of those movies you can go back to again and again, without getting bored of it. It is a nice mix of horror and comedy, while being the best werewolf movie to date. Not since ""The Wolfman"" from the 1940's has a movie about Werewolves been so good.
The story starts off simple enough. Two American travellers in England cross paths with a vicious werewolf, one is killed, and hte other survives. The one who survives starts to experiences strange mental episodes, and he wonders if all those stories about werewolves are true--if you are attacked and survive, do you yourself become a werewolf. Director and writer John Landis took his time with the characters, making them believeable and likeable. The dialogue is very well written, with touches of black humor to keep the movie from becomming a standard ""bump in the night"" horror movie. The special effects and makeup were, for their time, cutting edge. And even today, the transformation scene is unmatched.
The DVD is an excellent package. I always enjoy the commentary buy the film makers, but on this DVD, the two main actors (David Naughton and Griffin Dunn) do the commentary. Their commentary is more like a friendly chit-chat, with amusing anecdotes and plenty of insight. Also included are two excellent featurettes, one of the makeup, and the other is the original 1981 ""Making of"" special. The outtakes reel is the funniest, with one in particular that will make you fall to the floor laughing. You'll know which one when you see it, but in case you don't, it involves a falling ""setpiece"".
This is one of my favorite movies of the 1980's, and one of the first I looked for when I bought a DVD player. With all the extras and the top quality transfer, it is worth every penny.",1032393600,,1780,4.708333333333333
2662974,4,B000IONJHE,"4 Stars as far as monster films go, and 3 by average film standards. Meaning If you go into this movie not knowing what to expect youll probobly give it 3 stars, If you rented it for special effects and gore then its a 4 star film. I find the movie itself, kind of weak. Guy gets bit, turns into werewolf, eats people. The acting isn't spectacular (although the pain i nthe transformation scenes looks very real). Also the film has a lot of nudity (male and female) in it, which I endorse whole heartedly if used right, but it's kind of just thrown into this film. (But the porno movie makes me laff out loud everytime. It kills me that they actually scripted this situation for a porno they watch in the film) As far as special effects go, this movie is spectacular, The transformation effects haven't been topped to htis day. Even the dead people are pretty ripped up and bloody, altho the actual attack isn't shown, just the aftermath. THe film lacks longshots of the wolf tho which is a dissapointment and a hinderance to the movie. Luckily they are included on the extras. Also there are a few documentarys on the makeup, a commentary and some cool deleted scenes. The audio on the film is crisp and the dialogue is easily heard over the music(The Soundtrack is great). The picture is very clear nad bright, altho not mind blowing.
If youv'e seen the film and liked it, then definately purchase this version, it's loaded. If this is you're first Experience with the movie I would rent it first, unless you enjoy gory type horror movies(not really scary, but heavy on the blood). The film manages to fall in between standard horror movie fair and bloody B movie zombie flix.

Baker, in my opinion, is the best F/X guy around, some would argue Stan Winston, but some would be wrong.  The writing is hilarious, and the mood is creepy. I love how the movie just abruptly ends.  This is a classic that should be in every horror movie fan's collection.  My only complaint is I would have liked to seen deleated scenes on the DVD, rather than outtakes.

2662978,4,B000IONJHE,"""An American Werewolf in London"" was the first really scary and not campy movie my mother (who is a true horror movie buff) let me watch.  Looking at it from a technical point of view, I much prefer this type of werewolf (the all-fours, more wolf-like) to those of ""The Howling"" or ""Silver Bullet"".
The soundtrack is really cool too.
Without giving too much away, I think the scariest part of the movie isn't werewolf related at all.  It's the dream David has in the hospital.
There's a lot of subtle humor too, notably the scene in the movie theater.  Then there are others that aren't intentionally funny, such as the fact that Frank Oz is one of David's doctors (the sound of ""Bert"" giving medical advice is hilarious!).",1022457600,,723,4.589147286821706
2662979,4,B000IONJHE,"In my opinion, it is the most well made werewolf film ever made. Compared with other werewolf films, special effects scenes are very impressive. It can be compared with The Howling in the scene, which changes to a werewolf. Both are pretty outstanding. The Howling is more dreary and stylish, but this film is more humorous. That is the reason the director of this film is John Landis who usually made well comedy movies such as Blues Brothers. This is not a film that makes a mood gravely or horribly. On the contrary, it gives a laugh. One of funny scenes is, people who murdered by werewolf, appear again with looks what they are killed at that time. Absurdly, they come out at the adult theater to threaten werewolf, David, who killed them, to do a suicide. That is what they can get out of terrible appearance. The scene that David changes to werewolf and kills people ruthlessly at the middle of the city, London, is remarkably striking. Humor and wit, this is a peculiarity of this film. After this films success, imitation film, An American Werewolf in Paris was made in 1997. However, it developed only computer graphic scenes. Nothing was special, it was a completely parody of this film.",1021766400,,1198,4.682464454976303
2662980,4,B000IONJHE,"Young Americans David Naughton and Griffin Dunne go backpacking through the English countryside and chance upon a haunted and unfriendly inn, after which Dunne is killed and Naughton wounded by an unidentified large animal. Taking up with charming nurse Jenny Agutter, Naughton begins suffering nightmares and waking hallucinations of being a wild animal, of killing people, and of talking with his dead friend Dunne. It isn't too long before he - and Agutter, and Doctor John Woodvine - realize he isn't hallucinating.
Very well-directed and -acted piece, balancing horror and humor nicely, though not as smoothly and subtly as the contemporaneous The Howling. The balance is carried off by straight-faced and nightmarish surrealism, and the wholesomeness of the genuinely appealing young cast. The clever juxtaposition of American and British culture helps immensely, adding both to the humor and the realism.
This is a truly unique piece, not really succeeding either as a comedy or a horror film, yet satisfying somehow on both levels. It's a bizarre viewing experience, but an enjoyable and worthwhile one.  The special effects sequences, especially the transformations, are pretty impressive too.",1019606400,,1202,5.4972972972972975
2662981,2,B000IONJHE,"It's perhaps easy to see why 'An American Werewolf In London' became a horror classic.  After all, it's effects for the time were truly phenomenal and creepy little horrors set in England always seem to appeal.
Watching today the special effects aren't as good and there are other entertaining low-budget horrors out there.  It's not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with the movie, it's just that there's nothing particularly special about it.  Rather than focusing on the disturbing dream sequences with the main character dead best friend (who rots away as the movie progresses), we have to sit through a lot of tired flirtation scenes with nurse Jenny Agutter and a few chase scenes.
True, not all horror lies in how scary it is or how gory, but the human element of the movie is also lost.  The romance between Naughton and Agutter doesn't seem real enough to warrant her reaction at the end of the movie (which is admitedly impressive) and the few glimpses we get of Naughton's increasing insanity are all to brief.
To conclude, this may be better than a lot of horror rubbish out there but it's certainly little better.  To say that it's often hailed as the first-of-its-kind, there's little new said here.",1019520000,,1222,4.855769230769231

2662983,5,B000IONJHE,"The story begins when two American students, Jack (Griffen Dunne) and David (David Naughton), are vacationing in England.  Late one night, Jack and David are foolishly walking through the moors when they are viciously attacked by a werewolf.  Jack dies from the attack, and David is left badly wounded.  If you know anything about horror, you should be able to figure what happens to David.
After David recuperates from his injuries, he visits a movie theater that (unbeknowst to David until he enters) is occupied by undead werewolf victims, one of which is Jack, in various states of decay.  The victims try to tell David that he must do himself in before any harm occurs.  Of course, David refuses to listen.  And because of this, carnage ensues throughout London.  The morning after each incident, David finds himself naked and forgetful of what happened the night before.
Is this movie predictable?  Yes.  Can anyone over the age of seven understand that David is doomed from the get-go?  Yes.  Is it boring?  Nope.  As I said in the title, AAWiL is a triumph for all involved.  There are a few scenes that are truly frightening.  You won't easily forget the subway chase or the scene when David (as a wolf) causes mass destruction during a downtown traffic jam.  Rick Baker's 1980s elbow grease makeup work makes today's pushbutton CGI effects look phony.  Just watch David's transformation scenes.  Over twenty years after this film was made they still look astonishing.  Baker earned his Oscar.
Then there is also the wicked sense of humor.  One of the funniest lines ever on film was when David took a little boy's balloons to conceal his nudity.  Jack, even though he's dead and dropping parts left and right, is the life of an already lively movie.
In closing, this is one of many fine horror movies to come from the 1980s.  What makes AAWiL special is its abilty to make you laugh one second and shudder the next.  Many films have tried this angle and almost all are failures, even this film's sequel.

2662991,5,B000IONJHE,"Written and directed by a young John Landis, this 1981 release was a hit and rightly so. It is a smart, sharp, scary, and ultimately satisfying horror flick with a dash of romance tossed into the brew. Boasting a young and energetic cast, it succeeds brilliantly in what it sets out to do: entertain.
David Naughton (I'm a Pepper; you're a Pepper) is terrific as a young American backpacking along the moors in Northern England with his friend, played with comic deftness by Griffin Dunne. They are advised to stay on the road and off the moors. When they come upon a strangely named roadside in, they stop in for refreshments, only to get a very odd and funny reception upon their arrival. Feeling unwelcome, they decide to move along, but not before being told once again to keep to the road and off the moors.
Though they are able to see the road, as there is a full moon, they carelessly wander off onto the moors. No sooner do they do so that they start to hear the baying and howling of some creature. Scared and realizing that they have wandered off the road, they start running for it, when suddenly ""it"" is upon them, killing Griffin almost instantly before attacking David. David is saved by those very folk who had made them feel unwelcome in the inn. How they do it makes for a great scene.
The unconscious David finds himself waking in a London hospital several weeks later, remembering that he and his friend had been attacked by a viscious wolflike animal, a story at odds with what the police had been told by the local villagers. David begins to have some disconcerting dreams and visits by his now dead friend, who claims to be part of the undead. David, who thinks he is going crazy, is looked after in the hospital by an interested doctor, played by John Woodvine, and a lovely and caring nurse, played by a very young Jenny Agutter. David and Jenny happens to fall in love and upon his release from the hospital,  he goes and stays with Jenny in her apartment. It is there that, during a full moon, David experiences what he has become.
What happens next is both frightening and, at times, humorous, due to the wonderful script penned by Landis. The doctor, intrigued by David's claims that he was bitten by a wolf like animal, coupled with a bizarre series of murders where the victims are found half eaten, travels to where David had been attacked and discovers the same roadside inn, where he encounters a reception similar to that which David and Griffin had received. Returning to London, he sets about trying to help David. Meanwhile David is himself confronted by what has happened, though he has no recollection of having done anything. What happens next, however, will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.
This is a great horror film, well acted by the entire cast. The special effects won make up artist, Rick Baker, the first of his six Academy Awards for special makeup effects (Star Wars, The Nutty Professor, Planet of the Apes, Men in Black, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas). The DVD itself provides a crystal clear picture with excellent sound, as well as a number of special features. It also provides an interesting featurette on the making of the film, as well as a wonderful interview with John Landis. Among some of the other features is a commentary by cast members David Naughton and Griffin Dunne which is mediocre. They should stick to acting. There are also the usual storyboards and outtakes, though the outtakes have no audio. All in all, the DVD offers enough features to make it a value laden DVD and well worth having in one's collection.",1009152000,,3595,4.625978090766823
2662992,4,B000IONJHE,"I first saw this movie in the theatres in the early 80's when it first came out. I loved it back then and think that it has withstood the test of time rather well. Rick Baker's makeup still looks as good today as it did 20 years ago. The story is about a couple of American college students backpacking across Europe. They encounter a werewolf, one of them dies, and the other is turned into a werewolf. There is romance, comedy, and horror all wrapped up into one movie. This movie will appeal to a variety of audiences but be forewarned that some of Rick Baker's makeup is gruesome. I would classify this as a romantic comedy with gore, not just a horror movie. The video transfer was well done but there was a bit of grain early on in the movie. I assume this was due to the film stock condition. The video has deep blacks, minimal color bleeds, and no noticeable edge enhancement or artifacting. The DTS 5.1 audio track is very good considering the source track was Mono. The rears are used a few times as well as the subwoofer but most of the sound comes from the center channel. This again is probably due to the fact that the source audio was a mono track.",1007769600,,1163,4.315068493150685

The picture is so soft similar to a VCD/VHS transfer  and the audio, though originally recorded in MONO and upgraded to 5.1 and DTS surround, the effect is poor and soft. The movie needs a better treatment absolutely. Video : 3/5 (the picture is so bad when watching in widescreen format), Sound : 3/5 Movie :4/5.

2662994,5,B000IONJHE,"As many reviewers have noted, this movie is equal parts horror and comedy and never have they been blended this well and they probably won't be topped.  Director Landis has a good story here and he doesn't go wrong until the very end (I thought the ending abrupt but then again maybe a change from every other ending in this genre was his intention).  The love story was believable and touching and this is important because we care about David and he is truly horrified by his transformation and it's resulting consequences yet, he can't believe it until it's too late.  Jenny Agutter is very good as a working class nurse and Griffin Dunne is hilarious as David's best friend who is initially killed but comes back to haunt the surviving David, imploring him to do the right thing (by killing himself) or else, well, you know.
This has been a favorite of mine since it came out in the movies so I bought it with the intention of turning on my teenage kids to it and I wasn't disappointed.  We had just watched ""The Wolfman"" with Lon Chaney Jr. around Halloween so the little splice of that movie here was an interesting segue to a more modern version.
Just the right blend of horror and humor really put this movie at the top of the pile and the first transformation sequence is one of the best moments in horror film history---it hasn't been topped in all these years.  The only false note is the Piccadilly circus scene where just too many gratuitous accidents seems to take away from the truly horrible carnage preceding it.

David Naughton made the best portale of the man to be the wolf at midnight with good dramtic skills in scenes of shock and denile.

2662998,5,B000IONJHE,"An American Werewolf in London is a rare combination of true terror and great humor, but, as writer/director John Landis himself has said, it is not a comedy, for many presumed and still presume as it being one-a comedy-horror that is to say. It at times is a very funny movie-true, but it is not a comedy. It is rather a very saddening story when you really think about it. I mean, both primary characters end up dead for Christ sake, one leaving the love of his life in great grief. What's so amusing about that?
An American Werewolf in London is not only my favorite werewolf film with a great soundtrack (as one to play three different versions of one of the most popular oldies song ever, ""Blue Moon"", how could it not be?), but was also one to open up new doors for such horror films that center upon these hair-raising themes. Before it, there was no such a thing as a four-legged beast that was seen crouched and using all four legs when in pursue of its victims, neither was there such a thing as a film that was this imaginative and this realistic when it came to the transformation of a character turning from an average-looking man to such a vicious and grisly creature that prowls the night for ""fresh meat"" whenever the moon rises high in full form and sheds its light upon those who might possibly take pleasure of seeing it for the very last time. As makeup artist Rick Baker has said in an interview which you'll find on the Special Edition DVD (don't bother with the old one), it's nothing like Lawrence Talbot in The Wolf man, where they sit him in a chair and do lap dissolves, do a little bit more makeup and shoot some film, and do a little bit more and overlap the two. Landis told Baker that he wanted a dramatic piece that was never done before, and that's exactly what he got; the results were astonishing in its days. With plenty of cuts, close-ups of different parts of the body, and harsh bright florescent lights, there was no way to be tricked, as it all happened on camera. Here, you see it all. You see the hands as they transformed into paws, the changing of the skull, the spine arch, the rapid growing of the hair which ultimately covered the entire body. And what more, what is even more realistic is that, as all this happens to the very unfortunate character which David Naughton portrayed, to his horror, it turns out to be a very painful experience, and, when you think about it, why shouldn't it be? If you were to actually undergo through such a harrowing experience, if your body was to actually alter into the form of a wild mammal's, just imagine how painful that would be...and Naughton perfectly shows that; he makes you feel his physical agony. It's brilliant; a perfect depiction that, in my opinion, has never been done better in any other film that followed.
John Landis was first inspired to create An American Werewolf in London back in the year of 1969, when he was a production assistant in Yugoslavia on the set of Kelly's Heroes. ""We were driving on this long road,"" recalls Landis. ""The traffic had stopped because this group of peasants and priests were burying a body in the middle of the crossroads. It was a criminal, and they were burying him there so he wouldn't come back to cause trouble. This was 1969, man was on the moon, and these people really believed in the supernatural. That gave me the idea-to take the supernatural and place it in a contemporary setting."" It was then that he wrote the script in hopes of making the film, and though it was never green-lighted at the time because the studios couldn't figure out how a horror could be both scary and humorous, in 1980, after his success with National Lampoon's Animal House and The Blues Brothers, it finally was, and audiences were amazed with this man's and the rest of the crew's abilities, whose talents winded up creating what has now become the most momentous modern werewolf horror film ever!",1003708800,,3926,4.523206751054852

2663001,4,B000IONJHE,"This movie is such a great horror classic! The first I saw it was when I was like 10 yrs old. I was so frightened by this movie that I couldn't even watch some scenes comepletly through without closing my eyes! I couldn't believe what I was watching on screen. The werewolf looked, and sounded so creepy! Especially the beginning of the movie where they get attacked on the moors. It was so freaky because you couldn't see the creature that was coming after them! The make-up was another thing that made this flick so awesome! It was the first time anybody ever tried that kind of effects before and they succeeded to the fullest! Rick Baker is the man on this film and so is John Landis on his direction and writing on his film....The Dvd is really great too. I just recently bought it, and really enjoyed it! Except they didn't put any trailers or spots in he Dvd and I don't know why they didn't! Usually they offer that feature in the Dvd special edition. Oh Well,It's still a awesome horror movie at it's best! The featurette is a little short, I thought and the commentary is kinda of interesting to hear from the main charactors in the movie since you have never heard them talk about their movie before! This is a must have movie for horror buffs! I give it 4 stars! It would of been 5,but the Dvd lacks some stuff. Still check this one out for yourself!!",1002153600,,1363,4.3700787401574805
2663002,5,B000IONJHE,"I remember seeing this at a neighbor's house when I was only 5 in 1981. Darn, it's been that long? I remember how much I loved every second of it. It may be dated given the werewolf segments seemed too short and unconvincing, but why AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON works so well is 1) Rick Baker's as always spectacular make-up, 2) John Landis' direction, 3) great supporting cast, I personally loved John Woodvine as the good doctor, and Paul Kember as the clumsy police sergeant, 4) the soundtrack, 5) the locale makes the film properly eerie, especially the beginning as ""Blue Moon"" is heard, and 6) the entire transformation effects given this was some years before Computer Graphics Technology came along. Had this film been made now with that technology anyway it would not have been so great. This film doesn't need any special effects to make it so great.
The entire film may seem somewhat formulaic and short, but it all works so well you simply take it for granted.
David Naughton's werewolf as originally intended from Rick Baker was to be a biped similar to the Lon Chaney, Jr. werewolf, but director Landis proposed a sort of demon hound from Hell look would be much more frightening. He was right. Everytime I watch the transformation scenes, and the scenes were the werewolf is running amok in Piccadilly Square, it all looks so convincing. Even by today's standards.
DVD includes great special features such as a ""Making of Featurette"", which is disappointly short, interviews with John Landis and Rick Baker, and behind the scenes segments. The commentary by David Naughton and Griffin Dunne isn't all that great though.
All in all great addition to your horror film collection. (if you're feeling a little nostalgic anyway) Oh yes, loved the lovemaking scenes :)",1001808000,,1780,4.858552631578948

2663004,4,B000IONJHE,"Director/Writer John Landis and Make-up Artist Rick Baker reinvent the werewolf movie with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. With definite nods to the classic werewolf and wolfman films of years past, and though more or less adhering to the basic tenets of the traditional werewolf legend, Landis and Baker create a werewolf film that is more tragic, more horrifying, and more realistic than any that have come before it.  In other words, it ain't your father's wolfman.  (Actually, if you're too young to have seen this movie during its original theatrical run, this just might be your father's wolfman.  But Lon Chaney it ain't.)
Borrowing from the successful formula of James Whale's classic horror films of the 1930s, Landis uses both macabre humor and visual gruesomeness to tell the story of David Kessler, a young American college student who is bitten by a werewolf and subsequently begins to engage in ""carnivorous lunar activities"" himself. The juxtaposition of jocularity and repugnance creates a sense of uneasiness that only adds to the tragedy of David's fate, and Landis is successful in milking from this ambivalence a crescendo of terror that reaches its apogee with the film's abrubt, though effective, climax.
The contributions of Make-up Artist Rich Baker to the effectiveness of this film should not be underrated.  The realism and hideousness that Baker creates with his make-up and related visual effects provide the audience with the ability to suspend disbelief and buy into Landis' tragedy, and without them the film would certainly fail.  Many of the effects for the scenes depicting the man-to-wolf metamorphosis are actually ground-breaking make-up effects, and Baker was awarded the 1981 Oscar for Best Make-up (first ever for this category) for his work on AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.
The 2001 DVD edition of this film does not include Theatrical Trailers or TV spots--a required bonus these days, especially since a previous DVD release did include them--hence the four-star rating.  The film alone actually deserves a five-star rating, as it represents both ground-breaking filmmaking and great entertainment.  It is a must for fans of the horror film, especially those genre fans who place the werewolf flicks at the top of the list.",1001548800,,2269,5.217032967032967
2663005,5,B000IONJHE,"You wouldn't think that John Landis, director of 'Trading Places', 'Blues Brothers', and 'Three Amigos', would make a serious horror film, did you? Didn't think so. What Landis has done, however, is skillfully combine shocks and chuckles into a wild romp through one of horror's most worn-out sub-genres: the werewolf movie. Anyone who has seen 'American Werewolf In London' has not forgotten it completely. Many people only remember the startling transformation scene, a make-up masterpiece that would go unrivaled until Rob Bottin's work on John Carpenter's 'The Thing' in 1982, one year later. But those people need to see this film again for the effective performances (especially Griffin Dunne as the ever-rotting Jack) and the tight direction. In fact this film could easily be looked at as the pre-cursor to films like 'Scream', mixing horror and comedy in such a way that it constantly keeps us off-guard, guessing what will come next, a scream or a laugh. And like 'Scream', it's as much of a parody as it is a true example of the genre. The film is also a marvel to look at, with many gloriously lighted locations and eerie, tense atmosphere. But what keeps 'American Werewolf In London' afloat is that it perfectly strikes the balance between gut-wrenching horror and gut-busting humor, making it the perfect date movie and a film that no fan of horror films should miss. The DVD is long-overdue and has some nice extras to it. An interesting interview with special effects master Rick Baker is a nice addition as is the commentary track (by actors David Naughton and Griffin Dunne), which is almost as fun as the movie itself. The outtakes are a mixed bag and the featurette leaves a lot to be desired, but all-in-all I couldn't have asked for a better DVD edition of one of my childhood favorites. A perfect purchase for the Halloween season. Trust me people, werewolf flicks don't get any better than this.",1001376000,,1921,4.895705521472393
2663006,4,B000IONJHE,"It was midnight and I was in a small strange town in Colorado on my vacation. I was walking to the theater to see the opening of American Werewolf in London. The moon was full and I looked up in the sky and I am not kidding because I have never seen this before or since but the light clouds floating in front of the moon looked like they were stained with blood! I couldn't have picked a more perfect night to see the film.
American Werewolf in London is about two best friends taking a walking tour through the countryside of Great Britain. ""Stay on the path and beware of the moors."" They are warned by locals. After some light hearted banter they soon realize they have wandered off the path. A sound of a large animal in the distant mist stops them in their tracks and suddenly panic sets in as they realize something unseen is blocking them off at every turn...and then the attack.
American Werewolf is an original blend of the macabre and some truly gruesome but very funny humor delivered especially well by Griffin Dunne as David Naughton's cynical decaying friend who has to convince him he has become a werewolf and is killing the innocent people of London. American Werewolf is scary fun and even has a little sex thrown in for good measure with a nice performance from Jenny Agutter as Naughton's nurse/girlfriend. The film really cleverly uses Van Morrison's Moondance and Creedance Clearwater's Bad Moon on the Rise to perfectly set the tone for the film. Touches like that really make this film memorable. I think most everyone is familiar with Rick Baker's now famous werewolf transformation scene which inspired Michael Jackson to ask John Landis to direct his video ""THRILLER"". The film holds together great until the gruesome slam bang finale in Picadilly that is a little silly and over the top. But this still ranks as the best and most original Werewolf film made. I have not had the privilege of hearing the extras on the new DVD but they should be a lot of fun because the commentary is by Naughton and Dunne who have really great chemistry together. John Landis also is interviewed in the featurette. This should be a nicer widescreen print than the last DVD however I much preferred the old cover with Naughton and Dunne in the moors than this new closeup of the werewolf. It looks more like a gargoyle what it's supposed to be. If you are lucky enough to have a DTS receiver you are really going to enjoy the sound in the early attack sequence as the werewolf stalks its prey.",1001289600,,2504,4.566666666666666

Humerous and gorey, but not to a nausiating point, this film kept me in suspense and I really thought that David Naughtan pulled of the confused American fecade brilliantly.  The transformation seen was very believable and earned make-up guru Rick Baker a much deserved Oscar.
The story of two young american men out for a stroll on the moors of England during a full moon was brilliantly orchestrated by John Landis, and the plot was very smooth and not too unpredictable.  Griffin Dunne makes a wonderful corpse in the movie after he comes back from the dead to warn Naughtan about his little secret.

2663012,5,B000IONJHE,"That's the way this film was advertised when it came out in 1981, in the classic Universal monster sense ""a monster movie.""  As a child of divorce, I had a weekend Dad that would take my sister and me to any movie regardless of rating (well, within limits) and this one scared us silly.  I remember sitting in the theater and watching the transformation (having seen Lon Chaney Jr.'s transformation in ""The Wolf Man"" I was familiar with the lineage of the genre and the example this film had to live up to... having seen ""The Howling"" later (not much later, as the films nearly competed with each other theatrically) I was a huge fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late, great Dick Smith and the master of splatter, Tom Savini), I was just glued to the screen during one of the coolest effects of all time, just awed by what was happening, and just freaked at the believability of it all when compared to the stop-motion transformation of the Chaney makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (""be a Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) and Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower)... yowza! (Well, I was 11).
The only thing that's ever bugged me about this film is the lack of what's supposed to be a supremely gory scene that Landis cut out because it overwhelmed the scene that came after it (supposedly, audiences were so grossed out and shocked that they babbled through the entire dialogue scene that followed David waking up in the wolf's pen at the zoo): the scene was the expanded murders of the bums by the dock, and I don't think it makes it to this new DVD version of the film (which is a bummer, because the expanded gore in Verhoven's Robocop (Criterion edition) actually plays better than the MPAA approved version).
In any case, this is a truly great ""monster movie"" in every sense of the word... it's gross, funny, sexy, exploitative in many ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls it gore porn), truly a Landis film by dint of it's ""in"" jokes and orgy of automotive mayhem, and it offers great acting and casting (even in small roles like the Pakistani shift worker at the hospital and the punks on the London Underground).  Just an all-around fun movie, with truly amazing, and Oscar-winning effects (still looking awesome and believable... nothing digital comes close!!  I'll say it again: digital just ain't there yet... the transformation looks bone crunching, painful, horrific, and stretches the imagination in more ways than one).

2663013,5,B000IONJHE,"This was one of the first 'horror' films I ever saw, and it is by far one of the most memorable films of the genre I have ever seen.  From the cold, bleak beginnings with the two young American back-packers wandering into The Slaughtered Lamb, there is a certain ominous and effectivly eirey quality from the word go.  The comical naivety and the even-more comically sombre attitude that the locals at the pub engage in is movie entertainment at it's best.  It sets the scene for the true rollercoaster of a movie that is yet to come.  The gore is gorey, the scares are scarey, the comedy is spot on and the surrealism is baffling and highly disturbing.  It has to be said that the setting for the film in London is inspired.  Of course, the tolken well-mannered coppers and the ever-so nice doctors and nurses seem to be plucked straight out of the nearest Britsih book of cut-out stereotypes, but I don't think the film could have worked any other way.  A lot of people claim that Scream (1996) is the best horror-comedy since this little masterpiece, but how they can even be compared is beyond me.  Scream mocks (respectivley) an entire genre of slasher movies that died way before Freddy even hung up his old slasher-glove.  An American Werewolf was the only, and still is, the only film in it's 'genre'.  Original, profound, desperately enteratining and memorable in every aspect.

This is probably the best Werewolf movie that I've seen with the possible exception of the much more artsy ""A Company of Wolves"".  This movie has the best transformation scene that I know of, and possibly the most realistic.  For those days, that was far harder to do than it might be today.  Although, I have to say that I don't think that CGI is ready yet to make one better than this.  CGI just doesn't have that ""Suspend the disbelief"" look that it will need for something that can involve this much blood and hair.  At least not yet.
The transformation is not the most disturbing thing to me though.  The thing that keeps me up at night (and I hate to mention it here or even think about it) is the strange and bizarre attack of the Nazi werewolves in a ""I didn't know that it was a dream"" dream sequence.  What they were or what their real point was, I'm still not sure of.  All that I do know is that they scared the living fecal matter out of me!  Still do today.

Days later the bittin one, David, wakes up in hospital. Days later he sees his dead friend who tells him that he has become a werewolf. David doesn't believe this at all. Once realesed from hospital David notices that people are dying around London and that he also seems to wake up naked in strange places and the reason for this? He's a Werewolf, stalking the streets of London at night killing people.  An interesting little film this is, for one thing the effects are really good, the wereworlf transeformation is probably one of the best ones I've ever seen im my life, I mean this was done in the early 80s and the Werewolf looks cool. There is a good amount of gore in this movie as well, there was obiously ALOT of work done on it and it really does show. I am going on about this because I believe crit must be paid to the effects department for the great job they did. It's another good thing that the effects arn't wasted for the movie is very good, the plot is slow but interesting, the deaths are pretty good and there are some funny scenes as well, go out and rent this movie today.",981590400,,1336,4.301587301587301

This is the Mecca of Werewolf  films, and unfortunately there has only been one sequel (it was ok).

The werewolf itself far surpasses any other in  screen history as far as scariness (Although the one in ""Silver  Bullet"" aint bad) and you will never again hear the Van Morrison hit  ""Moondance"" without thinking of Jenny Agutter. We should all be  so lucky as to have sensual hotties as nurses! ""Blue Moon"" also  is heard in many versions, and the music only adds to the atmosphere in  downtown London, all the way to the middle of the moors, and who wants to  stop at the ""Slaughtered Lamb"" for a pint of ale after the movie  is over? It is very close to being the horror hit of the eighties.`It was  to werewolves what ""Fright Night"" was to vampires. One of the  very best of the horror genre.",965606400,,1019,4.379679144385027

Two American tourist  out in the English backwaters, go wandering the moors (at night! ) after  tasting the liquid delights of a local country pub (dont they watch  movies!  everyone knows you don't do that!  drink at country pubs I mean),  they are attacked by a werewolf, creating another family member of the  psychowolfman clan and giving us an undead sidekick.

2663033,5,B000IONJHE,"My first ever time: Ten years old, at a friends house. Friend has video that parents have unsuspectingly left lying about. ""Let's watch the movie!"". So we did.
Surprisingly enough, I am not scarred for life  as a result. Nor do I feel the need to hurt or injure people as a result of  watching this movie. I must be one of those people who can seperate fact  and fiction...I meander...
All I can remember from that first viewing was  the absolute sheer terror I felt when the original werewolf stalks the two  men on the moors. This level of terror did not abate throughout the entire  film, always knowing what might happen, never expecting it til the last  moment.
Since then, I have seen the film countless times, and it still  rates as one of my classic all time horror favourites. This is the pinacle  of the werewolf story (yes, I know, the Howling was good...but that was  always riddled with a sexuality which I felt didn't fit into the werewolf  mystique).
My only critique of the film is the change of the  transformation - of the two times you see it, the second time (in the  theatre), the claws sprout through his fingers, where as they grew from his  fingers in the first one. That's picky. Guess it's all I could knock it  on.

2663036,5,B000IONJHE,"Was it the poet John Keats who said something like in""truth there is beauty"". Well, ""An American Werewolf inLondon"" shows what truly is scary, and in many ways that truth is so realistic, horrifying and downright macabre that there is a sense of complex beauty portrayed.  Director John Landis is extremely underrated, and this film is perhaps the most overlooked bit of genius I've ever watched. The one seen which will probably scare the hell out of you is when there is a dream sequence of running through the woods and you see a hospital bed. I won't tell you what happens but the fear that is evoked in that seen overwhelms anything ever shown. Remember in ""Jaws"" when Richard Dreyfuss goes underwater to search the wrecked hull of a ship and the dead body of a man suddenly appears out of nowhere? For me, that scene pales in comparison to ""Werewolf's"" frights.  As I said, I think Landis really thought hard about what would frighten someone and he put it into this film. For instance the flashback to David Naughton's family in America is interrupted with a hellish sound of incessant, nonstop banging coming from the front door. When the father answers it, lo and behold, but a group of Werewolves dressed up as Nazis begins stabbing everything in sight. Another, revolutionary scare tactic is the sound interruptions used when the werewolf prowls the streets (after his awesome ""beautifully realistic"" tranformation). Right when you think the wolf is going to jump out and rip someone to pieces, Landis cuts to a ""horrifying"" scene and sound of a train passing by, or a lion roaring in the zoo Naughton awakes in. Another important idea is the humorous ""twists"" added to the story. The detective who is completely inept at many things, knocks over a set of bedpans arranged like a china doll (one inside the other), as he tries to put these pans in the right order (with the doctor's watching) you think to yourself-this is so weird, why is this happening, this is funny, but is something horrible goin to happen. And thats what is terribly frightening about this movie, we never know when something greatly moving, funny or horrifying will occur. I think part of this could be paralleled to the fact that Naughton is an outsider to England. From the first scenes of those horrifying moors we hear the wonderfully eerie tune of ""Blue Moon"". Naughton and Dunne truly are like Samuel Clemens' ""Conneticut Yankees in King Arthur's Court""-outsiders to a strange world...This is a great film. I recommend it very highly (if you haven't noticed).",924825600,,2550,4.806378132118451

2663039,5,B000IONJHE,"One of the best horror/comedies around, director John Landis gives the viewer a perfect balance of both genres.  There's also a touch of romance thrown in for good measure.

David Naughton plays David Kessler, a  luckless young American tourist in England who, along with his companion  Jack, are attacked one night while strolling along the British Moors.  Jack  is mauled to death, but David lives on, only to awake from a coma in a  London hospital.  David's doctors are skeptical when he describes the  attacker as being a wolflike beast of some kind, but a group of locals who  witnessed the incident are reluctant to come forth and reveal the awful  truth behind that night's proceedings.  In addition to this, David's sanity  is tested when his late friend Jack comes back from the (un)dead to warn  him of his impending transformation into a lycanthrope.  David subsequently  finds solace in the arms of one of the hospital nurses, Alex Price, who  falls for his naive charm, and becomes intrigued by his apparent madness,  his predicament as much a mystery to herself as is to him.

Landis'  ""Werewolf"" blends the best of both worlds, delivering perfectly  timed shocks, believable characterisations, and an understated comic  sensibility which relieves the tension at the most appropriate moments of  the film (""I'm sorry I called you a meatloaf, Jack!"")  You can't  get much better than the brilliant make-up effects by Rick Baker,  especially his intensely excruiciating yet artistically exquisite werewolf  transformation, done like none other ever seen before or since on  celluloid.  The soundtrack boasts a number of ingeniously selected ""moon""-themed songs, including three very different versions of the classic ""Blue Moon"". The absense of a formulized ""Hollywood"" ending is another bonus, confirming the movie's status as a bonafide timeless cult  classic.  Remember: ""Beware the moon, lads"".

8147034,4,B000IONJHE,"A timeless and ageless gem to the horror genre.

Want some laughs? It's got those too!

John Landis and company have delivered one of the most profound, and cinematically awestruck Horror/Werewolf films in history.

One of the many reasons why this film works so well is the dramatic shift and scale from the harmless life of American David, to the horrific and screaming world of the supernatural lycanthrope/werewolf.

Not only are the visual effects there, but the undertones present in the time, and the back-narrative on the film's uses of said Special FX. For instance, with the dream sequence, Ms. Piggy and Kermit make a point that puppets are quite a powerful tool to the screen, because while it can look quirky, it will always function the best and look the most realistic. This is a tone and context that may not have been so impacting then, but with today's technology makes for a great punchline for Stop Motion Animations, Animatronics and Puppeted nightmares being the better of all CGI and so forth.

The narrative can feel quirky and odd at times, but the payoff is great for a horror fan who wants to see a monster go ballistic and berserk. While there are times where the sexual undertone comes a bit too far out the movie's pants/skirt, it has a humorous level that allows the viewer to both laugh and cringe at it (particularly the theatre/peep show scene near the end; it is moronic and ironically funny/scary).

If you have not seen this film, watch it: you may get a few jump scares, keep in mind, but the payoff for the film leaves you simply and plainly awestruck with the amazing look of this American Werewolf in London.",1515196800,,1649,4.688581314878893
