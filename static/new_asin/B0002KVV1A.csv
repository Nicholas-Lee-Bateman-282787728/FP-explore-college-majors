8028700,2,B0002KVV1A,"If you saw the 'coming attractions' trailer on another DVD, be advised this first DVD is almost nothing like what you saw.  This series apparently began life as a collectible card game, which leaves viewers who know nothing about the game in a bit of a lurch.  There is a 'guide to the world of Aquarian Age' included, but as there is almost no direct reference to any of these factions in the first five episodes, it's useless information.

Few of the characters generate any real sympathy.  Most of the personalities are abrasive, and, as might expected of a series that focuses on supernatural factions battling for control of the world, openly hostile, manipulative, and starkly lacking in any of the better human emotions.

There are no clear-cut 'good guys/bad guys' in these episodes, just an assortment of characters with dubious intent, manipulating and being manipulated by others with equally questionable motives.  Viewers attracted to this sort of gray area characterization might enjoy this, but the same vagueness makes a viewer investment or interest in the ultimate fate of these characters difficult to secure.

In some areas, ""Aquarian Age"" succeeds a little too well:  it's *too* complex for an introduction to the story world, the everyday characters are *too* everyday and seem a poor fit for the supernatural elements, and the mysticism is *too* out there, the mysteries *too* convoluted, and too much under the surface.  *Some* surface clarity is needed to hook viewers!

What this story needed was a principle character who knew what was going on, or had some understanding, a character whose perspective we could see, as opposed to seeing the effects on said character, with no clue as to what the causes were.

As far as the dub goes, there are some very jarring translation errors and poor word choices.  (Using 'senior' in place of 'senpai', for example, but using it the same way as 'senpai' is used.)  The English voice-actors, for the most part, are quite good, considering the limitations of script.  The animation and music are of decent quality. Too bad the presentation of the story doesn't match.",1113868800,4,2133,4.988700564971752
