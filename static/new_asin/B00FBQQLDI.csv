5974560,5,B00FBQQLDI,"This was very informative and I learned a lot about each character.  It was unremarkable to find out that ""Harvey"" was nothing like his character.  He seems to be shy and quieter than his character, but nonetheless spectacular.  Really love everything about Suits!",1382400000,,264,5.093023255813954
5974561,5,B00FBQQLDI,I always wondered if they had the figured out the can opener thing... now I know. I love that they all get along and I liked to hear from the creator how they come up with the law cases - what a great way to develop those cases - always looking at how it will affect the dynamics of the characters. This was very entertaining and I'm glad that I can be a fan of the who the actor's seem to be as people. Very funny!!!,1382140800,,417,3.86046511627907

5974608,5,B00FBQQLDI,"Patrick Adams was the most personable and natural talker of the group.  I was surprised that Gabriel Macht was considered the most different from his TV show character, w/ the director/writer chiming-in that Gabriel is the worse negotiator ever. Gina Torres seems in-charge even when just herself. And before watching this panel, I was bewitched by how cleverly and entertainingly Rick Hoffman plays Louis. But then Rick sat on stage, chomping on his gum like a cow, and that blew it. This is the second time I have seen an actor being interviewed like this (the other at an Apple store), where the actor is going-to-town on some gum.  It's unprofessional and tough to get past, as a viewer.  And he definitely couldn't field a question intelligently and chew gum at the same time...when it was his chance, he hemmed and hawed. More panels like this please - was entertaining to watch the ensemble's interactions and for them to share their observations.",1468800000,,954,4.8765432098765435

5974653,5,B00FBQQLDI,"Absolutely love this show!!! I as well signed up for Prime because of it! There are some movies, shows, etc. that even though u end up watching all season or shows and know the outcomes, you would watch over and over - like 24 (also a great series that I liked) - and would purchase. This for me is one of them not only because the writing is excellent and the acting, but the casting is perfect - 5 stars to these actors and actresses along with the creation, production and writing -- and Harvey is perfect as he is so faceted . Of course, Gabriel just is ""so pretty"" - can never tire of his person and style ! I hope this series goes on for well over 6 seasons!!  Thank you Amazon for carrying it!",1442188800,4,700,4.109489051094891

Being a fan of the show, the premise and the novelty of the show, and the cast, especially Gabriel Macht as Harvey Spector and Gina Torres as Jessica Pearson, I have watched this program many times, end still enjoy it.

I hope there will be many many more seasons of Suits.",1429228800,,497,4.297872340425532

5974673,4,B00FBQQLDI,"Never watched an actors' panel like this before but found it fun.

My favorite part is that apparently the actor who plays Louis Litt is truly awkward in a bizarrely compelling way. And surprisingly says 'like' and 'you know' more than most 14 yr old girls in his last answer.

Megan Markle reveals that she struggles to watch her scenes.

Overall the actors come across great, especially Gina Torres, even though she is pretty quiet. Patrick Adams has the most to say and is charming through and through.",1417478400,2,505,4.715909090909091

5974675,5,B00FBQQLDI,"Perfectly casted and cleverly written. This show is only for the grown and sexy. It's a great script and the delivery is witty  with a cynical sense of humor that I happen to love. Plus the fashion makes you want to work in an office. At least that office. And what can I say, Harvey Specter played by Gabriel Macht is so deliciously handsome and confident you'll start dreaming about him in your sleep.",1411516800,5,403,4.445945945945946
5974676,5,B00FBQQLDI,"This is a great show, with good charachters that fit well together. As long as it doesn't turn into a soap opera I'll keep watching.",1410998400,,132,4.32

But having worked in Film and Television in my past, I respect the need of ""down time"" i.e. hiatus.",1399075200,2,265,4.32
5974683,5,B00FBQQLDI,"Suits is a balance of humor and the seriousness of solving crimes.  But ultimately it is clean entertainment.  The directors do a great job meshing unique and flamboyant personalities with the more ordinary.  One of the things i love most is that the two main male characters as different as they are, are both smart and witty.  They pull their witt together to solve crimes.  Fun!

Cute cast really!",1390521600,,103,4.2
5974686,5,B00FBQQLDI,I found it interesting and entertaining to see the creator's thinking as he develops each character and plot.  Also realized how good some actors really are and how others just play themselves. The camaraderie among the staff made it fun to watch. The writers of each episode are fantastic and so are the free ad lib wisdoms from the actors.,1390435200,,341,4.683333333333334
5974687,4,B00FBQQLDI,"This show shows the life of attorney's - including the side all attorney jokes were derrived from, but also shows the humanity and political nature of playing the part.  The pairing of the two main stars is perfection.",1389830400,,218,4.7368421052631575
5974688,5,B00FBQQLDI,"You are all so cool, I can hardly wait for the new season and to see you all sitting together was so wonderful--your portrayal of real dramatic characters with real stories to tell, please continue without the foul language and nudity that you all have so aptly and discreetly dodged--an actual drama for adults and 'law' who would have ever guessed--hip hip hooray may you all have many, many great seasons together, your audience loves each and everyone of you and your writers, thank you so much!!!",1389657600,,501,4.7701149425287355

5974692,5,B00FBQQLDI,"Interesting cast, good plot lines, although sometimes too clichd. Best when it focuses on the intrigues and manipulations within the firm and less interesting when  it becomes soap opera like dwelling on the characters personal lives.",1382745600,6,234,5.5
