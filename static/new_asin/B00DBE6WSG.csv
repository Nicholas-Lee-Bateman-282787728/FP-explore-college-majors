5787156,5,B00DBE6WSG,Enjoyable.  Don Matteo is the Italian version of BBC's Father Brown and the English subtitles make it understandable.,1416268800,,117,5.5

5787160,2,B00DBE6WSG,"I love Don Matteo, but only four of the episodes where not on the Don Matteo discs I had already purchased. That's a lot of duplicate episodes.",1384646400,5,143,4.333333333333333
5787161,5,B00DBE6WSG,"This show is great.  Has English subtitles and is a really good family show.  Yes there may be a murder mystery, but you don't see the blood and guts.  This show will keep you guessing.",1378857600,2,185,4.228571428571429
5787162,5,B00DBE6WSG,"This is a long running (I forget how many seasons) show in Italy. Believe me, it doesn't lose much in the Atlantic crossing. The mysteries are compelling, but clean, and Father Matteo is a priest who loves the people around him and that love (plus his faith) gives him insight into the crimes. The interactions between Don Matteo and the police force often provide moments of humor, while never belittling the hardworking detectives. Also, if you know a bit of Spanish, you'll find yourself picking up on the Italian. What a fun way to learn another language!

One caveat... This does have several stories that duplicate those in the Don Matteo set (2008) published by Ignatius Press. Only the first four are not on the other set.",1377129600,11,730,4.748031496062992
8591237,4,B00DBE6WSG,I love the scenery and the music. I do get a bit put out at Natalina always blowing her top and also Don Matteo isn't always that empathetic about her having to do so much work and not receiving that much appreciation by some of the people who live there.,1518739200,,255,4.12
8591238,5,B00DBE6WSG,I ordered it for my friend (who is computer-less).  So Carla loves Don Matteo!,1457568000,,78,4.571428571428571

8591240,5,B00DBE6WSG,"This is great family entertainment: a little drama, a little humor, and a moral message about how we should all act to make the world better. What a great new role for Terrance Hill, whom we loved in the Trinity movies.",1454198400,,219,4.365853658536586
