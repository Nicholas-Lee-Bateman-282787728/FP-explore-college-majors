558603,2,6303082653,"A rather strange ""Natalie Wood"" movie.  Although she recieves top billing, she has the smallest part of the three major stars.

The real star of this movie seems to be the B-52 (which I assume to be an ""A"" model"").  The shots of it in flight and on the ground must have been awesome to see on a movie theatre screen.

There are plenty of goodies for any old airplane buff.  Great shots of the B-47, and even some action with the old propeller driven KC-97's.  Even a couple of close looks at an F-86.

Otherwise, the plot is somewhat hokey, and predictable.  Without spoiling it too much, at the beginning of the movie we find the action in Korea- during the war.  Efrem Zimbalist, who is a Captain, orders Karl Mauldin, a sergeant, to repair his F-86 so he can get to Tokyo.  Mauldin objects because it is nighttime, and any lights would attract North Korean fire, and he assumes that Zimbalist wants the aircraft repaired so he can meet with one of his honeys.  Anyway, Mauldin opens a panel on the side of the aircraft that is about the size of a microwave oven door and his crew then lights up the WHOLE AIRPLANE with enough light to illuminate Yankee stadium.  Needless to say, this does attract the fire that everyone was worried about.

Had they not invented the flashlight at that time?  Could they not have worked under a rain poncho or a coat?

Anyway, one of Mauldin's crew is killed in the attack and this creates major friction between him and Zimbalist, who, lo and behold, becomes the wing commander at Mauldin's base later when the B-52 is to be made operational.  It gets to be even more fun when Zimbalist begins to date Natalie Wood, who is Maudlin's daughter.

Well, as my wife always says.  Forget it- it's just a movie!",1252281600,13,1741,4.455696202531645
558604,3,6303082653,"Bombers B-52, a post-Korean War epic brought to you courtesy of the Military-Industrial Complex, stars Natalie Wood, Karl Malden, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in a tale of jealousy and technology, with a gorgeous, elegiac score by Leonard Rosenman.

The story of a father and a suitor who battle for Natalie's love dovetails somewhat awkwardly with the B-52, which is an icon-like technology presence in the movie. While Efrem Zimbalist falls in love with Natalie, the audience is supposed to fall in love with the B-52.

And well they might. The footage of the enormous B-52 is impressive and particularly suited to the Cinemascope format (at that time, also a NEW and exciting technology), and obviously Warner Bros and the Air Force worked hand in hand to bring us this ode to military technology and Cold War supremacy.

Efrem as an Air Force Colonel, and Natalie as the daughter of an aircraft mechanic ""crew chief"", are really good, but Karl Malden as Master Sergeant Chuck V. Brennan, the stubborn, righteous man with the tools of truth and integrity, is generally annoying and more or less weighs the movie down. Perhaps I'm being unfair as I am confusing the character in the movie with the most capable and likable actor, Mr. Malden.

Yet for all it's flaws and a campy story that plods along, I like this movie because it evokes the 50's and the Cold War so well. It recalls a time, almost forgotten, when fighting the Commies and ""defending freedom"" (even as hundreds in the US were blacklisted by the UAA) was just about what everybody drew their next breath for. And when, after ten years of the Great Depression and almost as many years of war and scary conflict, luxurious material things and earning more money were a real novelty and something to appreciate and even discuss. The materialism of the late 50's and early 60's had a basis in fact.",1251158400,3,1858,4.760869565217392
558605,3,6303082653,"My dad received this as an early Birthday present, and he forced me to watch this because I had forced him to watch Punisher War Zone! I didn't think it was awful, it's just not my type of movie. Master Sergeant Chuck Brennan doesn't like Colonel Jim Herlihy, and to make matters worse, Chuck's smokin' hot daughter, Lois is dating Jim. There are a few funny moments. I love the look of the classic 50's! You might like BOMBERS B-52!!!",1239667200,3,435,4.45
558606,4,6303082653,"This film was one of those 'feel good' movies about the U.S. Air Force during the 'Cold War' years of the 50's.  The stars of the movie are very old now or deceased (Efrem Zimbalist Jr is still alive, I believe, and Karl Malden has recently passed away.  Natalie Wood of course has passed on- so sad! Anyway, the story-line centers around the introduction of the B-52 (NOT the song group!) in the mid-50's as the primary strike weapon of SAC (Strategic Air Command).  Many of the aerial scenes are well done, including some interior filming of the '52, but, considering the era, I really don't know how accurate their replications were for the film.  The story is both a 'National Security' and a 'Personal Family Security' tale; an airman devoted to family and career.  Of course, at movies end; 'All's well that ends well'.  And that's the way I remember it back then. The B-52's used in that film have long since been gone, with up-dated versions still serving our country.  Can you believe that some of these 'crates' are older than the guys who are flying them?  Conclusion:  A good 'era' film incorporating some 'old-fashioned' family values that seem to be missing today...",1203984000,11,1180,4.717073170731707
558607,3,6303082653,"Bombers B-52 fits in the sequence of features with Twelve O'Clock High (1949), Strategic Air Command (1955), and A Gathering of Eagles (1963), as the 1957 period piece when the Air Force's Strategic Air Command was bringing in the B-52 Stratofortress.  The story is about a dedicated Air Force sergeant, Master Sergeant Chuck Brennan portrayed by Karl Malden, who resents his new commander, Colonel Jim Herlihy portrayed by Efrem Zimbalist Jr., for an incident that killed one of Sergeant Brennan's airmen during the Korean War.  Despite his distaste for Colonel Herlihy, Sergeant Brennan begrudgingly continues to serve in the squadron in order to field the new B-52s.  Matters become more difficult for Sergeant Brennan when his wife and daughter begin to pressure him to leave the Air Force for a more lucrative civilian career.  The movie's positive aspects are Karl Malden and Natalie Wood, and the nostalgic scenery of B-47s, B-52s, cars, and late '50s fashion.  Its script, however, is melodramatic by contemporary standards, and introduces the ridiculous development of a love relationship between Sergeant Brennan's teenage daughter and Squadron Commander Colonel Herlihy.  Despite these issues, Bombers B-52 remains another good period feature of SAC with its 1957 setting.",1139961600,8,1283,5.422110552763819
558608,4,6303082653,"This movie has some great shots of B-47 and B-52.  Natalie Wood was wonderful as she always was.  Could not tell if this was Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.s first movie or if he was just being presented by this studio for the first time.  Story line a little improbable though.  Still a good yarn for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon though.  Woould recommend it for history viewing also.",1103414400,2,376,4.552238805970149
558609,4,6303082653,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I finally got around to watching this movie, I really liked it.  It has great shots of
B-47's and B-52's in action, the story line was good (although not probable, a squadron CO would be canned immediately for what the movie character was doing), and I thought it portrayed the life of a military aviation mechanic fairly accurately (I was one in the Navy).  If you enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's ""Strategic Air Command"" you'll enjoy this movie.
I gave it four stars because the story line is stretching it a bit but overall I enjoyed this display of Cold War Era SAC equipment.",1054252800,16,605,4.541284403669724

This would never be tolerated,  (fraternization), in the real Air Force, but it makes for conflict in the  story line.  Excellent footage of B-52's on the ground and in the air.  Reasonably accurate portrayal of the stress and strain of life in the late  50's Air Force.  I was a ""SAC weeney"" from 1963 until 1979 and it  brought back a lot of memories.",935971200,59,537,4.698924731182796

The flying scenes inside the B-52 are ludicrous. The scene where the colonel ejects the sergeant is a howler.

Some good flightline footage.

I went on to be come an officer in the USAF, and still, can recall the deafening roar of those 8 Pratt & Whitney engines on a B-52.
This DVD movie is not about propaganda for the USAF, because this production is about a war readiness  in an uncertain peace during the Cold War Era in which the B-52 aircraft was one of the primary weapon systems on the center stage to deterrence.

559296,4,6303082653,"Again a movie I was brought up on, but this one is in a vivid color to bring the masses to the theater and away from the new invention the TV.  Natalie Wood the heart throb of that time is lead in this film but Karl Malden gives a great performance as a very believable Master Sargent, Line Chief at Castle AFB, CA.  On the other hand Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as an USAF flyer is like John Travolta masquerading as a B 2 pilot in Broken Arrow! He does not make it and he does not fit the story!  He does not have the look of Air Force never mind pilot.  Additionally, for a pilot at that time to move from Tactical Air Command (TAC) to Strategic Air Command (SAC) would be sacrilegious and rare.  This reveals problems understanding the USAF culture for the screen writer.  Finally, the hair cut may be fine for a lawyer in 77 Sunset Strip but not as an USAF Colonel.  It would have been much better having the unaccredited Stewart Whitman who was flying co-pilot as the aircraft commanded in that part.  At least he has a close credible look.
As a retired USAF officer who flew with SAC and worked in TAC I was very interested in viewing this film.  I enjoyed the story and found it could be real but the above cast flaws and screen writing was disappointing.  It appears this film was an introduction of The Superfortress B-52 to the American public and cold war-era preparedness to reassure the masses. Again, Warner Brothers injects its small screen stars into and a major motion picture to link the two media.
I very much enjoyed seeing my favorite USAF aircraft in the F-86 and B-47 in action and to see the B-52 in its original paint.  A great American era long gone but as I remember it.",1380240000,11,1691,4.336507936507936

559434,4,6303082653,Bombers B52 has an all star cast and a great story to tell.  It gives us an overall picture of an exciting time in America's history as we gained superiority in air power.  It is also about one Air Force family and their sacrifice to keep the B52 flying and protecting our country.,1352073600,,281,4.283018867924528
559435,4,6303082653,"""Bombers B-52"" with Karl Malden, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and Natalie Wood, made in 1957, compares favorably to 1955's ""Strategic Air Command"" with Jimmy Stewart and June Alyson.  Indeed the two films could be considered prequel and sequel, two chapters in the history of SAC and nuclear deterrence.  Jimmy Stewart flew the B-36 and the B-47.  Karl Malden maintained the B-47 and the new B-52.

Karl Malden gave a spirited performance as ""Master Sergeant Brennan,"" a supervisory crew chief, keeping the aircraft flying.  He's also the father of Natalie Wood, being courted by Malden's squadron commander.  The fine flight line scenes were filmed at Castle Air Force Base in California.

Of course, the major co-star is the ""A"" model of the B-52 Stratofortress, and the photography of the aircraft in flight and on the runway is quite gorgeous.  Fans of aviation films will also enjoy seeing the KC-97 tanker and the oh-so-sleek B-47 Stratojet, aircraft now largely forgotten.  Men and machines together anchored much of America's response to the Soviet threat during the Cold War.

559480,4,6303082653,Bombers B-52 is a good movie. Especially if you like military aircraft. This movie was filmed at March Air Force Base and at Castle Air Force Base. Bombers B-52 shows plenty of B-47's and B-52's. This is a movie about an Air Force Maintenance Line Chief and his Squadron Commander and the conflict between them. Line Chief Karl Malden thinks that  Squadron Commander Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is an Jet Jockey Casanova. Malden doesn't like it that his commander is dating his daughter Natalie Wood. This relationship has the possibility of hurting the deployment of the first B-52 Wing at Castle Air Force Base. Trouble boils over just before Zimbalist B-52 is picked to go on a non stop  trip from Castle Air Force Base to Egypt and back. Malden puts in for retirement when his boss is trying to keep him in the air force. Malden as a Line Chief is picked to go on the flight. On the return leg of the flight a fire breaks out in the B-52. Malden is forced to bail out and Zimbalist leads the rescue party to find him. Malden is surprised because he as always thought the Zimbalist character is only out for himself. In the Korean war Efrem Zimbalist Jr's F-86 jet landed at a forward base in Korea. He ordered  Karl Malden to fix his plane at night. Malden had always thought that it was so he could keep a hot date in Tokyo/ Zimbalist was under orders to report to Headquarters A.S.A.P with information on a secret North Korean base. Malden is convinced to stay in the Air Force and Zimbalist gets Natalie Wood at the end. I like this movie just for the footage of the B-47's and B-52's on the flight line and in the air.  It is well worth watching,1290038400,4,1645,4.401315789473684

559485,3,6303082653,"This is a hokey film that has little relationship with real SAC/B-52 operations in the late 1950s.  However, it is certainly worthwhile as a means of viewing some flying shots of the (early) B-52 aircraft.  Most of the ""on-base"" flight sequences were taken during the film-crew's visit to Castle AFB (at the time, near Atwater, California; the base was closed some years ago).  As a young Lt. fresh out of USAF flying school, and assigned to the 328th Bomb Sqdn. at Castle, I was lucky enough to see some of the filming, and observe some of the 'stars' walking around the base.  It was amusing to see Mr. Zimbalist walking around in his colonel's uniform, and being saluted by all lower ranks who passed him; I'm sure he got a chuckle out of it.
