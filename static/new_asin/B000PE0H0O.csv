8190708,4,B000PE0H0O,"The age of the internet has given us one sure fact, anime is always better in Japanese. English VA's, even the best of them, will very, rarely surpass the original seiyu. Zatch bell is yet another example of ""acceptable"" voice acting. Though it has its nice moments, it serves as a reminder to only buy anime (that is already free online) in boxsets (and to also remind ourselves that some anime is crap by modern standards, so no longer enjoyable).",1366588800,,449,4.625
8190709,4,B000PE0H0O,"I remembered this show from a few years back and decided to rewatch it, this particular installment was a bit of a let down, you don't really get to see the nitty gritty of the fight with the characters depicted on the front, so I imagine you see the brunt of the fight on the next one, and had I known that previously I would have bought vol. 12 instead of this one, but this one isn't bad, one episode will pull on your heart string a little and there are a few hilarious moments so for $5 its pretty good. At the end of the day if you were a fan of the series, sure get this one, but if you are new this may not be the best representation of the series",1360281600,,655,3.8955223880597014
