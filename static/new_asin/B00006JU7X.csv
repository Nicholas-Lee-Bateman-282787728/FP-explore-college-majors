1782530,5,B00006JU7X,I bought volume three after seeing most of the stunts performed on TV already but this show never gets old. Poo Diaper was one of my favorite Jackass stunts of all time I laughed so hard. It still was worth every penny and it makes me laugh every time. The stunts however were better on Vol. 2 in case you were only going to buy one but for only 17 dollars its worth all the laughs you'll get out of it. Johnny Knoxville is one of my favorite comedians and even though Viva la Bam and Wild Boyz make me laugh too I still wish Jackass was still on the air. Greta humor and kids remeber don't try and of this at home.,1115424000,,615,4.008130081300813
1782531,5,B00006JU7X,"I also have the movie! My favorite stunt on this DVD is ""the omelette"". In my opinion, THE BEST PART OF BREAKFAST! {no, not really}. All of the other stunts are....different...sort of in their own way. I haven't watched the t.v. show on MTV, but I have seen and own  volume 2 and 3 and the movie. The reason the stunts are different are because some of them may end up being shocking, but they're cool anyway. If you want a good laugh, watch some of them. Trust me. Have faith in yourself, and I say that to whomever reads this review. I think there should be a sequel to the movie because these guys can do....pretty much whatever they want. Enjoy!",1097798400,,649,4.319672131147541
1782532,5,B00006JU7X,this video is fu*king funny as hell. if you see jack ass the movie and liked it. you have to see this one. it keeps on getting better and funny. a must have for any jack ass fan,1065744000,,177,3.6842105263157894
1782533,5,B00006JU7X,"Yes kiddies, if Volume 2 wasn't enough for you, ""Jackass: Volume 3"" is here to give you more laughs, more cringes, more sickness, and more pain.  Some people think the show is utterly stupid and pointless.  Yeah.... and the problem is?  That's why it's so funny.
This isn't for people with weak stomachs.  A lot of the things you're going to see on this DVD are going to make you sick and cringe a lot... but you'll be laughing like hell if you're a sick and twisted S.O.B. like me!
When you purchase Volume 3, expect to see this:  Bounty hunter, beard of leeches, full pipe skating, bottle skating, hot dog skate boarding, security guard, nutball, spermathon, fat ---- #2, and much, much more.  Once again, nakedness is blurred (not really a bad thing if you ask me) and cuss words are bleeped.  Still I do not know why they feel that the actually swearing has to be bleeped out and yet swears in the background music can still be left in.  Oh well.
And again, no spectacular special features included, but it's the 77 minutes of hilarity and madness of the actual show that counts.  The few features included are things like a trivia game, photo gallery, and cast bios.
So if you think you can take another dose of Jackass, then by all means pick up ""Jackass: Volume 3.""  While it may not be as good as Volume 2, it is still a very worthy purchase.  Be prepared to laugh, cringe, and be disgusted.  All that fun stuff, right?  I thought you'd agree with me.
Kids, don't try this at home.  Until you are an actual member of the official show, just stick to watching so I don't have to hear parents and the news complain about how terrible of a show it is.  All right?  Think you can do that?  Great.  Thank you.",1040256000,5,1712,4.363924050632911

7970737,5,B00006JU7X,"Ok all you jackass fans, if you have yet to see jackass vol. 3, you are missing some of the best stuff ever. of corse not as good as vol. 2, but great none the less. One of my favorite stunts in the corse of the dvd, is Dutch BMX. I don't know why, but I just thought the editing was really great. The music, (Which I have no idea what was but would like to, and if you know contact me at fearseeker@gmail.com) Really fit really well with the skit. Another skit that I am fond of is 90 year old man. If you have seen the movie, It is kind of like the one in there. Johnny knoxville goes to a make-up artist (which used up almost their whole budget) and was decked out to look like he was 90 years old with great results. I am not saying anything more about this one, because I don't want to spoil it. On of my favorites on the dvd it tandom snow boarding. I think that says enough. And another is Dutch girl. In this Pontious dresses up like a dutch girl and skips happily down the street only to reveal to the onlookers, and he has no under pants on under his dress. My review is 5 for this dvd, and if it could go any higher, I would. My advice, buy the dvd and feal what it is like to laugh harder than you had ever thought possible.
