6184148,4,B00HMOW9YM,"I agree with these other folks...I too am glad that the Batman and Superman Filmation cartoons are finally coming out but I was hoping that they would use the original format as the Batman/Superman Hour with the original beginning.  I haven't seen that since 1968 when I was 6 years old.  That would've been REALLY neat.  The same with the Superman Aquaman Hour of Adventure.  The tune that is sometimes used during the Batman cartoon was actually from the beginning...""Batman...Superman, Batman...Superman!  Here comes the badguys on the run...Batman...Superman........""  I don't know how I can remember that, but I do!  Amazing!!!  I'm also waiting for some more Filmations like the Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage.  I'm really looking forward to the Superman ones since I didn't see them uncut since 1968.",1393200000,9,832,5.103703703703704
6184149,4,B00HMOW9YM,"I think my title says it all? What kind of a confusing mess is this? Yes, I'm glad we finally get to have the Batman cartoon adventures I grew up with on DVD, but why use graphics of a 1970's Batman and Robin on the packaging and NO MENTION (on the front at least) of what is actually in the box! I think a lot of people will be returning this expecting to see the artwork that is on the box. I don't know what's on the back, but I sure hope it outlines the 1960's filmation series and shows a few screen shots. Thank you WB for the series FINALLY, but what were you thinking on the box art?",1392940800,20,591,3.933333333333333
6184150,5,B00HMOW9YM,"THIS is what fans of classic Filmation DC heroes wanted released YEARS ago! 17 full episodes (34 shorts) consisting of the Dynamic Duo ,against such ruthless rogues as ""The Joker, Clown Crince of Crime; The Penguin, Pudgy Purveyor of Purvity; and the Cool, Cruel Mr. Freeze.""

These shows were broadcast opposite Superman on CBS in the late '60s when Filmation was still a fairly young name in Saturday Morning animation (Filmation would move to the syndicated animation market sixteen years later; but not with this, so that's another story for another time). While these episodes were definitely not ""BATMAN: TAS,"" also understand that it would be several decades before Batman TAS would be on television and these are great for fans of lite Saturday Morning fair (like I said, this is the collection that fans wanted years ago).

6184181,5,B00HMOW9YM,"I wanted a Batman cartoon that my three-year-old and I could enjoy together. It's super G rated, none of the peril is too much for him. I remember watching this from my childhood and I like that the emphasis is usually on Batman's cleverness rather than his brawn and he's happier than in most incarnations. It's Scooby-Doo level animation, which I think is part of its charm, but don't buy it if that bothers you.",1516233600,,414,4.533333333333333

6184187,5,B00HMOW9YM,"The Very First Batman Cartoon.

These are great and very nostalgic.  I think this was the first licenced  comic book property that Filmation animated.  If you lived the live Action Television  series Starring Adam West and Burt Ward then you'll  enjoy these cartoons. They have the same feel and campy humor as the live Action series.  My only wish  was  that this set had some bonus features.  Still,if you really love Batman then this should be apart of your DVD collection.",1492646400,2,476,4.765432098765432

6184207,3,B00HMOW9YM,"If you're a fan of the original 60's Adam West, Burt Ward TV Spoof series of Batman, this show will appeal to you as it captures that style very well with its storytelling, characters and execution. The stories do sometimes get repetitious however but do try to be amusing in the TV spoof style. Bang, pow, zap for the fights. Much like a comic book.

Only other real concern I had was the fact that the show has way too many close up views of the characters face. So expect 80% of every shot in each episode to consist of a static face in the foreground taking up 50% of the screen, and someone in the background standing nearby. This was the intentional style, so if you're a fan, enjoy. I prefer more breathing room when watching a show. That said, the art style is well done, and this is a historic take of Filmation's early days and interpretation of the Caped Crusader, Batman.",1463184000,3,883,4.384146341463414

6184227,5,B00HMOW9YM,"These cartoons from 1968 are great for Robin fans. While technically his sidekick, Robin is not just cheering from the sidelines while Batman does all the heroics. In these episodes, Robin gets plenty of action and is almost an equal to his famous mentor. I have included some screencaps of Robin to illustrate this.

In this two-disc set, episodes are grouped in three's: a two-part episode followed by a one-part episode. The opening and closing credits are shown only once in each three-part set.

Except for the opening credits, the image quality is pretty good. The price is right, too!

  The Batman series was first shown when I was near release from active duty, in 1966.  My section NCO two children that loved the series.  I didn't know which was more fun, Batman and Robin or SSgt Woody's two kids.
  I watched the series as my work schedule allowed, and thoroughly enjoyed the program.  I looked for the modern day Batman & Robin series for quite a while until I found this series.  The quality of the video is excellent and easily viewed on a CRT, LCD or LED displays.  What I did discover was, for a 70 plus year old man, I can watch 4 to 5 episodes at a time before I begin to loose contact with the programming.  However, my grandkids can watch The Caped Crusaders for hours, so it must be in the old man's rubble.
  Would I recommend the Batman Series for others, Yes, even to my friends.  For entertainment, which is what it honestly is.",1421020800,3,944,4.381502890173411

6184322,2,B00HMOW9YM,"Like most of the other reviewers here I love this show, so my disappointment is strictly with the DVD. Starting with the case this release shouts: ""CHEAP!"" the plastic used is very flimsy. The disc menus appear to have been made with some of those free DVD authoring programs. But the worst is the picture quality of the episodes themselves. Although not the worst I've ever seen, it is far from the best. The opening titles look very drab, as if sourced from a very old print and the image is not only shaky but also unstable. When the actual episode starts it remains shaky and unstable but it gets brighter. TOO bright actually. I can't be certain but I believe they have used some sort of edge enhancement which created a lot of jaggies and sometimes, when there are two lines drawn closer together they tend to flicker. I compared the first episode to a sample on itunes and although the picute instability on itunes is a bit stronger, the jaggies are nowhere to be seen, which for myself at least, is more pleasing to the eye. The audio is standard and contains languages and subtitles in English, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. By the way, sadly, the Brazilian dub is not the original, but the newer dub which uses a different soundtrack. As I said before, to me this show is great but Warner really dropped the ball on this release, specially considering that this year it's Batman's 75th anniversary. I just hope they don't do the same when they release the 1966 TV show.",1402444800,,1483,4.578947368421052
6184323,5,B00HMOW9YM,"I am so very glad that series is at last out on DVD. Just as the Adam West show ended Filmation animation gained the rights for Batman. they already had a long history of superheros. First with Superman later with Aquaman and others. so for the first time Batman came to the screens in animation form. I am a big fan of the 90s animated series, but I accept all versions. I love this early begining of Batman animation. Here Olan Soule and Cassy Casum (Shaggy on Scooby Doo) voice Batman and Robin. (they later go on to voice them in the Superfriends Hanna Barbara cartoon. Ted Knight would narrate and voice many characters.

so for this DVd it has the complet late 60s Filmation Batman animated series. i feel that not only does it have the spirit of the West show but it also has the feel of Silver Age comics. (which i could say about all the Filmation toons). Your not gonna get dark gritty stories here. its all light fun and adventure. but its good for the whole family.

Batman and Robin come up against many of their most well known foes. the Joker is there, The Penquin, Catwoman, there is the ""cool cruel"" Mr. Freeze (who just gained popularity with the West show, which took the one shot villain Mr Zero, renamed him and made him famous). there is the Riddler, who would go on to Superfriends but do to rights issues not the 77 Filmation toon. There are many other foes all who make their first animated apperance. Scarecrow and Mad Hatter make single apperances. there are new villains. Simon the Pieman, the Judge. Dollman. Batgirl (who just won new found fame) shows up a few times to help out.

on the whole this is just a fun series with lots of cool adventures. the first time Batman made his mark on the animated world.

Later on in 77 Filmation would do another cartoon. some are iffy about that one. i liked that it had Adam West and Burt Ward do the voices. it was still a fun show. but that is for another review.",1402185600,20,1936,4.3694444444444445

6184325,5,B00HMOW9YM,"This collection stands the test of time. Fans young and old can enjoy this interpretation of the character. Voice actor's , Olan Soule  as Batman and Casey Kasem as Robin bring back a lot of memories.  Unlike the current ""Dark Knight"" interpretation; this Batman is closer to the one from the live action TV show in the sixties. If you were growing up in the late sixties or early seventies, you'll remember the late, great Filmation Studios. The stories are simple and unsophisticated in contrast to what passes for super hero animation today.

You can watch this one with your family without any concern about adult material that is part of the current DC animated films. If I were marketing these DVD's I'd put a ""fun for Batman fans of all ages"" label on this one.  Too many of the new animated cartoons and movies should have labeling to indicate what type of audience they are for.  If I were a parent, I wouldn't want to pick up ""The Dark Knight Returns"" animated film for a five year old youngster. However this collection is your old school, bright knight, dark knight Batman all us baby boomers are very familiar with!",1402012800,5,1128,4.62
6184326,5,B00HMOW9YM,"hey there! darrell mcneil here. i was an animator/layout artist for filmation associates, (among other studios), in the '70's and '80's, participated in the writing of two books on the studio, including the recent autobiography of my old friend and boss, filmation co-founder lou scheimer and am cyrrently doingmy own thing with animated and live-action projects,including the last one lou participated in before his passing. i'm looking forward to 'the adventures of batman' release, having had tapes of the show for years, but there's a factual error i saw in one of the comments above that i wish to rectify. much as i respect his talents as a boice artist and the work he did for filmation on several series, larry storch was NEVER the voice of the joker! joker, as were all of the villains, was performed by ted knight. not only is whoever keeps stating that in error, but when hanna-barbera animated batman, robin, , joker & penguin for the new scooby-doo movies in 1072, they used the same lead voices for it and that included TED doing the exact same joker voice he provided in the batman series. listen to both of them and see if that isn't so! regardless, these shows are trteasuresand it'll be nice to have crisp quality dvd versions of them. (a shame, though, that they had to finally come out after lou's passing....the copies he had were ones i gave him,and he would've enjoyed seeing them in this format.",1400889600,72,1419,4.748987854251012

6184328,4,B00HMOW9YM,"I have watched the new set of these classic FILMATION cartoons from 1968. I was unsure if that was what they were until I recognized the episode titles listed on the back. Why feature 70's art renderings of the dynamic duo when the FILMATION-looking characters are INSIDE the package? Anyway, once you get past this blunder...the contents do not dissapoint...mostly. The opening main title credits look like crap on EVERY episode! It literally looks like someones VHS taped off a cable broadcast. But the episodes themselves and the end credits are pristine and better than ever!! They look and sound fantastic! So I'm very happy...but a bit confused.",1400457600,11,651,5.037037037037037

6184330,5,B00HMOW9YM,"""THE ADVENTURES OF BATMAN"" was certainly worth the wait,in all these long years,and especially before 1992's Emmy winning ""BATMAN The ANIMATED SERIES"",which was launched by FOX,and ignited the cartoon success,in the 23 years to follow. but
this series was special,because it was THE first ever cartoon series of Batman,after the original ABC-TV series ended its primetime
run in 1968. aired as part of ""THE BATMAN-SUPERMAN HOUR"" for CBS on 9/14/68,the original animated series was done on a more
serious level,despite the ""limited animation"" work,that was used,and was well written by the likes of George Kashdan,Bob Haney,and
others,who made the cartoon version of Batman,way more different then the live action series,and very true to the comic books of the
time period,since this was the later half of ""The Silver Age"" for National Periodical Publications,currently known as DC Comics. the
animation design of Batman and Robin was well made,since they were done in the image and drawings of master artists like Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson,who were also responsible for the incredible drawings and artwork of the comicbooks in
the mid and late 1960s,and the many great cover art,of these comicbooks,that made them such a success! Filmation Associates
at the time,was still a newly formed animation studio,who was enjoying great success with ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN"",and in Fall 1967,""THE SUPERMAN-AQUAMAN HOUR of ADVENTURE"" on CBS,which made this network THE No. 1
place for Saturday morning cartoons,also thanks to Fred Silverman,before his rise to network status in the 1970s. the Batman cartoons were pretty much the main success at the time,until the complaint from many angry and concerned parents forced the TV
networks to cut down on all the cartoon violence being shown! of course this didn't stop Filmation Associates,who,during the same
year (and network) achived MEGA success with ""The ARCHIE SHOW"",which went on to do a 10 year run on Saturday morning TV,
until 1978. so while ""The Adventures of Batman"" did a great job for Filmation,the other people involved,also get a large chunk of the
acknowledgement,too! Ted Knight for one,before landing the ""Ted Baxter"" role on ""MARY TYLER MOORE"" in 1970,was Filmation's
main voice actor,who gave these shows the class and taste-voicing all the villians,and actually doing a BETTER job,before the likes
of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill became the main names in this area of Batman's animated history. veteran actor Olan Soule was
without a doubt,THE best Batman voice over,and because of that,he and Casey Kasem,went on to voice their roles,first in 1972,
on two segments of ""THE NEW SCOOBY DOO MOVIES"",even with Ted Knight,and from there,came ""SUPER FRIENDS"" for ABC
in Fall 1973,which went on to an 11 year run- that's how good Olan Soule was! and one of the other people behind Filmation's Batman series,was executive producer Allen Ducovny,who was also responsible for all the Superman and Aquaman cartoons at the
time! in general,the 1968 Batman cartoons were both liked,and disliked,because many thought that the animation was too cheaply done-Filmation at the time,like Hanna-Barbera,were under fiscal limitations,since their Network contracts only allowed them to do so
much,for so little time,,not overly acceptable to those,who couldn't understand these reasons-but whatever is said here,Filmation really
did a great job with their Batman cartoons,despite their limits,this didn't hinder their success in any way, at all! the 1968 version of
Batman,was WAY better then Filmation's 1977 ""THE NEW ADVENTURES OF BATMAN"",even though Adam West and Burt Ward
came back to voice their charecters,the second version just didn't have the punch and charm,that the 1968 cartoons had! and although they are no longer with us,Lou Scheimer,Norm Prescott and Hal Sutherland WERE the true kings of TV animation-and the
BATMAN cartoons they did,for better or worse,was part of their impressive 25 year history,and the outstanding works to follow,as
a new generation of fans and viewers can look at their cartoons to determine what they were,,some may not like them,but the majority will also see it from a different view,since their version of Batman,was still true to the Silver Age history of DC Comics.",1393718400,4,4271,5.376119402985075
