8136738,4,B000H5UL20,"""Ambient Space"" is very good on two scores:  It shows excellent photos of everything from the earth's surface to the far reaches of the universe.  It is very educational for those interested in the development of the USA space program.  One feature that could be improved is the presentation of the subtitles identifying the subjects shown.  When these subtitles are selected to be shown, the subtitle banner obscures about one third of the picture.",1419638400,,449,5.027027027027027

8136740,2,B000H5UL20,"This video if it may be called that consists of a bunch of slides (photos) of rather poor quality. Since I viewed some pictures in PBS website of Hubble's photos I was excited at what I thought would be of the same fine quality.  Boy  was I wrong.  There is no flow to this ""video"" and no audio background other than a choice of a few hot numbers to play while you click on the remote to get it to go to the next picture.  Rather feeble.",1170979200,5,437,3.9885057471264367
8136741,1,B000H5UL20,"This CD intrigued me to the point of purchase, being I liked to view NASA photos. Unless you have a high resolution wide screen big television, it will NOT work very well on either a computer screen, or TV screen. I was disappointed. I contaced the company, and they said that the quality and resolution was ""as best as it could be"", and is best viewed on a big screen TV, which I do not have. Not very promising from the write-up they have. I would buy this program only if there were not so many other better quality pictures out there on the internet. I would not recommend this program to anyone. poor image quality.",1168473600,,620,4.353448275862069
