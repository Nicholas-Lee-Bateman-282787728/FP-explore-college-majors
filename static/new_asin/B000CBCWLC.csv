8096665,5,B000CBCWLC,Lorenzo had a lot to do with this hard-hitting movie. Loved the martial arts. The story line was pretty good and I wish he would do more of these better type movies. Great stuff.,1501113600,,178,4.264705882352941
8096666,2,B000CBCWLC,"""C.I.A. II: Target Alexa"" is most notable for being Lorenzo Lamas' directorial debut. While in many ways no worse than many action films in the genre, it struggles with budget constraints, odd editing decisions, and some extremely wooden acting, particularly from Alexa herself, Kathleen Kinmont, the then-wife of Lamas. The DVD has a cheap menu and no extras and my copy had a lot of audio dropouts. The CIA has a very limited budget these days by the looks of things and the plot revolves around a nuclear device that looks like a microwave oven. Of course standard issue terrorists in black have no trouble breaking in to steal it. It's all very realistic.

The stunts and effects are hilarious, and the backstory and exposition are labored and boring. Considering the amount of action on display it's a bit stunning how boring it is. The good news about the boredom is that you'll have plenty of time to concentrate on the details. I, for instance, wondered why if you're running around in broad daylight shooting people with a machine gun, why do you need a silencer? The backstory involves explaining how Alexa is actually an illegal alien, and how the government is going to frame her for manslaughter, but they will drop the charges if she will work for the CIA. This results in some absolutely atrocious emoting and Alexa strengthens her position by assaulting an attorney. So why does the CIA want a mentally unstable woman with a peculiar pseudo-British accent to work for them? Oh, of course...it's because only she can infiltrate the bad guys led by Kluge (John Savage). Of course Lamas and Alexa have a romantic backstory and the terrible dialogue that's part and parcel of it: ""I don't have a garden and I can't cook!"" (This passes for pillow talk in this movie.)

Alexa infiltrates Kluge's camp of 60 hardened terrorists and, of course, intimidates them all by destroying them in a fight. Thank goodness they all just politely wait their turn to be mauled and don't attack her simultaneously. Making this patently more ridiculous, we learn that Alexa's daughter's father is Kluge, who keeps prattling on about ""that night in Beirut"". You may think that's the worst of the dialogue, but you'd be wrong. My favorite line in the movie is ""I always wanted to visit North Korea"", a sentence never uttered by anyone unrelated to the Kim family. The double-crosses and laughable romance subplots pile up in an unseemly mess (Kluge has the nuclear chip under his bed and Alexa finds it straightaway), and there's a test of character when Alexa has to choose allegiance to Kluge or Graver (Lamas). Who will she choose? Who do you think?

If you don't know where this is going, let me you give you a clue: the claws are out. Alexa (it should be noted that Kinmont is quite attractive) has to fight an even more attractive woman as the men cheer and yell (""No scratching!"") Suddenly a helicopter appears and strafes the camp because...no reason, just because. In a lesson on continuity, they shoot down the helicopter and it crashes in a huge explosion, but it's back and totally fine in the next scene. We also learn that a helicopter can scare horses. Who knew? Conveniently, Alexa finds a fully saddled horse in a field (thanks to the helicopter scaring it there) and she rides off, before being abducted by the helicopter. Thank goodness she's got the chip! Through yet another ridiculous double-cross Kluge and Graver end up with guns pointed at each other and they...form a team of some sort. (?)

Kluge spills the beans and reveals that North Korea is the buyer of the chip, and they are having a party for the North Korean representative, Colonel Trang (Michael Chong), which gives them an excuse to put in lots of shots of women in bikinis. But after yet another pointless and public double-cross, Trang finds himself removed from the picture. There's another fight between Alexa and a very fit evil woman on a tall structure next to the beach. I won't tell you who wins, but I will reveal another line of comedic dialogue: ""You can fall, but you can't fly!"" Because, well, why not, another helicopter shows up to shoot at the bikini nuclear holocaust party. There is quite a tussle for the nuclear payload which involves another double-cross, helicopter theft, some silly stunt work, and Alexa successfully teaching herself to fly a helicopter in two minutes. Does Kluge survive his fall from the helicopter? I'm not saying, but it will not be spoiling anything to reveal that Graver and Alexa end up together again at the end (like there was any doubt in a movie like this).

This movie wasn't unwatchable, but it wasn't good either. There are some mildly amusing moments in it, but they're pretty sparse. Some of the cast and crew did better than others. Watch for the cameo by Branscombe Richmond, note that the First Assistant Director was Gilbert Alexander Wadsworth III, and pay heed to the credit ""Special Thanks to PAC*TEL Pagers"", which gives a very good hint as to when this movie was made. Alexa and some of the other women are very attractive, but the action sequences are hokey and boring, the plot is needlessly contrived and unconvincing (even for this genre which always requires some suspension of disbelief), and much of the acting is simply painful to endure. If you like low budget action films from the '80s or '90s, this may be worth a shot, but it's not memorable in any way.",1485907200,2,5413,4.754255319148936

8096671,2,B000CBCWLC,"This is the kind of picture with which there is nothing particularly wrong, but nothing that  commends itself as being worth seeing. Story concerns the easy theft of a super secret weapon and the  effort to infiltrate the thief's headquarters to get it back. The problem with the picture is that the whole thing looks like  it was created and produced by a high school film society whose main ambition was to get on stage to show off for their friends and family.

8096672,2,B000CBCWLC,"In 1993, Lorenzo Lamas premiered ""CIA II: Target Alexa"" - a redundant but ultimately inoffensive follow-up to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/low-profile-flick/dp/B00009MEFF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">low-profile flick</a>&nbsp;he and his then-wife Kathleen Kinmont had done in-between episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renegade/dp/B003XMKU0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renegade</a>, made notable only for the fact that it was also Lamas' directorial debut. While not a bad movie, it lacks the desired auteurship, meaning you can't tell it wasn't directed by any number of non-notable filmmakers. Lamas fan will probably want to pick it up for the sake of novelty, but I'm not sure anyone else would be interested.

The story: when a dangerous terrorist (John St. Ryan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Cyborg-Steel-Warrior/dp/6303060013/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Cyborg: Steel Warrior</a>) acquires a microchip with nuclear capabilities, the CIA's Mark Graver (Lamas) will need to re-recruit the crafty operative Alexa (Kinmont) for one last mission.

I know it's an unfair comparison, but while watching the flick, I weighed it against the first-time directorial outings of other action heroes, like Seagal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>&nbsp;and Van Damme's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quest/dp/0783226748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quest</a>. At first glance, the Lamas outing is decisively the cheapest: director Lorenzo obviously had the smallest budget to work with, and the limitations show in comparison, since both of those other two spared no aesthetic or geographic expense en-route to becoming flops. Additionally, it really doesn't seem like Lamas did anything out of the ordinary for his auteur debut: while Van Damme remade&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;on an ""epic"" scale and Seagal stuffed about every single one of his spiritual and political ideas into his environmentalist flick, Lorenzo seems to be either following a cut & paste pattern or being told what to do, since ""Target Alexa"" is bog standard, feeling like your basic early-90s action schlock on most accounts. The one unexpected and refreshing thing Lamas does different in his picture is not glorify himself: whether this was his decision or just the script talking, Lamas almost feels like a bit player in his own movie, compared to how Steven and Jean-Claude tooted their own horns in their films.

Kathleen Kinmont is definitely the star here - something I have mixed feelings about. Her acting's not bad, but when it comes to the action content, she's no Cynthia Rothrock. Many of her moves look professional but she's lacking convincing strength. Her two fights with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Gladiator/dp/B001XW7IDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Gladiator</a>&nbsp;Lori Fetrick feature a couple of nice exchanges of holds, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rothrock-vs-Shepherd/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rothrock vs. Shepherd</a>&nbsp;this ain't. In general, the action content feels too impersonal: there's a good deal of shooting and plenty of explosions, but the Kinmont/Fetrick encounters are the only one-on-one fistfights. Lamas pokes his head in from time to time to punch or kick someone, but by large, the film is missing his serviceable fight scenes.

The production is the only definite area where Lamas' inexperience as a filmmaker stands out particularly.  Nothing's really wrong, but several shots are timed poorly and the music is frequently underwhelming - not quite matching the tone of the scene. This aspect juuust manages to nudge my review down to its current rating, setting it right beneath my persona standard of action sustenance. I don't recommend ""Target Alexa"" but I don't particularly advise you to stay away from it. This is one of those movies that you can afford to watch on TV one night but otherwise leave be. Fans of Kathleen Kinmont might want to pick it up anyway for her considerable part, but otherwise, let it be.",1332460800,3,4521,6.869337979094077
