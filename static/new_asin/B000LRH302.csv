8163868,1,B000LRH302,"This was so interesting.  It came out a long time ago, but I wasn't aware of it until I ordered it.  It's a great put-together of the scenes she shot in the last movie that wasn't completed, and a documentary as to what happened to her.  I was a fan of hers, and I was 14 when she died.",1427414400,,286,3.8135593220338984
8163869,2,B000LRH302,"Other than the film clips and photos, this documentary is full of the same old garbage.  It was put out by 20th Century Fox, so that should tell you something.  However, I did love the Somethings Got To Give film at the end.  It shows all the footage, as an actual film, until they shut the production down.  This is the actual reason that I ordered this DVD.",1390953600,,359,4.235294117647059
8163870,5,B000LRH302,"I bought the whole set a while back and let my ex borrow this DVD, well be broke up, and I lost the DVD. I found this one and bought to complete my collection. It arrived in good time, end just as described. Will do business with this vendor again!",1374537600,,248,3.98
8163871,3,B000LRH302,"This film is mostly a movie filled with photographs that show different periods in her last days. There is very little actual moving film information. They do show the actual film footage, what there is of it, from her last movie. There are the almost nude scenes that were so well publicized when the film was being made.

The nice thing about the film is Marilyn herself, always glowing, smiling, beaming, seeming to enjoy her celebrity very much. The tragedy of her early death is treated with respect, but I felt after I watched the film, I would never watch it again, as it didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know.",1362873600,,632,4.592920353982301
8163872,5,B000LRH302,For any Marilyn Fan this is a must have about the final film that she never finished. Its great to get the inside story from those that were there and their impressions of Marilyn and what the studio was doing to her and the film it self. you won't regret it! GET IT!,1268438400,,267,4.056603773584905
8163873,5,B000LRH302,i just received the movie its simply marvelous i highly recodmined to any fan of marilyn monroe or the motion picture industry.,1232409600,,127,4.818181818181818
8163874,4,B000LRH302,"Although it was really amazing to see the reconstruction/restoration of ""Somethings's Got To Give"" and view all of the footage of Marilyn from her last (and unfinished) film, it was extremely disappointing to see the angle that this documentary took. Interviewing a senile housekeeper (Eunice Murrary) years after the fact and giving her testimonial credibility? Putting in the innuendo of the Kennedy's being responsible for Marilyn's death? Leaving out her re-engagement to Joe DiMaggio? Most of the people interviewed (with a few exceptions) are the self-serving sycophants who hung onto Marilyn and were honked off when she tried to cut them off the gravy train right before her death. Every frame of Marilyn's performance is magical; she looks absolutely luminous, and although the film itself would probably not have been a stunner if finished, Marilyn herself would have given a first-rate performance. So, if purchasing don't look for an accurate documentary; but enjoy the performance  from Marilyn that could have been.",1188086400,6,1029,5.391304347826087
8163875,5,B000LRH302,"The very touching ""Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days"". Narrated by James Cobourn, it's an open and honest look at what took place in the last few months of Marilyn's life, and the problems she was having while filming her final film. It's practically a day by day, sometimes an hour by hour account of the events leading to Marilyn's death. Her many missed days on the set of due to poor health and assorted maladies, caused the cast and crew many problems. But..she was Marilyn, and the stars, her Doctors, Susan Strassberg,and others close to her during her last days speak about those very emotional days. Some of these interviews alone, are keepsakes from greats no longer with us. There is also never-before-seen footage and some wonderful scenes of Marilyn interacting with the children of the film. Other great footage, includes the famous Birthday party scene for President Kennedy, and the nude scenes she did in the pool for the film.

Immediately following the documentary there is an edited, reconstruction of the scenes shot for the film. This film, also starring Dean Martin, ""Something's Got To Give"", which was to be a remake of the Grant/Dunne film ""My Favorite Wife"", finally saw an audience as ""Move Over Darling"" with James Garner and Doris Day.

This is an absolute must for MM fans. It's a piece of cinematic history to be treasured. It may also be purchased in a fabulous set, The Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection which also includes Bus Stop / How to Marry a Millionaire / There's No Business Like Show Business / Gentlemen Prefer Blondes / The Seven Year Itch. The DVD runs nearly 2 hours in total.

Enjoy....Laurie",1172448000,,1638,4.822064056939502
