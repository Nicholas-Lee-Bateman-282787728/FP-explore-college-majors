8328141,4,B001NY4WZG,"Very informative, recommeneded viewing for the generations who never knew the scourage of polio.
If the reader wishes to see a drama featuring the struggle against polio, I could recommend a 1946 movie
""Sister Kenny"" starring Rosalind Russell.",1421020800,,243,5.421052631578948
8328142,5,B001NY4WZG,Very informative and sad. I think many have forgotten the polio scare! AWH,1416960000,,74,4.769230769230769
8328143,5,B001NY4WZG,"I saw this on American  Experience DVD on TV and loved it. I have a friend who is 93 and was in charge of setting up the polio treatment centers  where patients were cared for. She was out West and in Alaska for several years.  I gave her the DVD and the book for Christmas and we watched the program today and she gave me added info as it played and it was a great history lesson. My friend went on to become a physical therapist and worked in that field until last year when at 92, she retired.. The March of dimes recruited former WWII nurses to care for the polio victims. My friend, Carmen, also served in the Army and was happy to work in the fight against polio.  I think the book which I have not read should have included interview with the nurses, especially Carmen. She could have added a great deal to the story.",1388534400,3,824,4.163522012578617
8328144,5,B001NY4WZG,I contacted polio in March 1949 at the age of 15 months.  I was curious about this disease and bought the DVD. I did not check the length of the DVD and was disappointed that it was only 60 minutes long.  Other than that it is a informative DVD. I did not know about the epidemic that besieged one town nor when the March of Dimes was created.. I would recommend this DVD for information.,1374537600,2,388,4.16
8328145,3,B001NY4WZG,"Polio has gone from an illness that paralyzed myriad people, especially children, to a disease that is largely gone from the populace.  This documentary tells how it happened.
When I think ""polio,"" I free-associate to FDR and he does show up.  I learned about the creation of the March of Dimes.  (However, I must say that the work doesn't speak of the organization's change of focus once a vaccine had been made.)  They speak of a tension between Doctors Salk and Sabin which reminded me of the tensions between WEB DuBois and Booker T. Washington.
This work covers the 1940s and early 1950s, a time before the Civil Rights Movement and the Brown v. Bd. of Ed. decision.  Of course, the virus does not think about race, but this was a very segregated time in the country.  Thus, I am very surprised at how diverse this documentary was.  One sees Black kids as well as white ones and often time mingling with each other.  Remember Charles Drew died because a hospital wouldn't admit a Black man, even though he was a renown scientist.  So this dynamic in the documentary was an eye-opener.
I hope I don't misquote the documentary, but it did seem that a vaccine save those who weren't sick and did nothing for those who were already ill.  This is not about a cure for the infected.  That dynamic plays a huge role in the research of distressing illness of our time.
Currently, the whole world is afraid of the spread of swine flu.  Fearing the spread of a disease, especially one harming children, will feel very urgent to modern viewers, even as the footage here is black-and-white and from a half century ago.",1241568000,3,1611,4.594405594405594
