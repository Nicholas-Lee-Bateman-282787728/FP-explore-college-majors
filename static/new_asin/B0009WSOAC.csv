Levon is a born storyteller, and talks of his early days in Helena, AR, (my home town), and his time with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks and with The Band. Rick Danko and Garth Hudson from The Band accompany Levon for some great rock/blues playing.

I've watched the entire DVD twice and listened to the songs many times, and I've only had it a few days.

As I said, it's great whether on not you have any intent to learn playing the drums.",1165449600,4,598,4.378378378378378
