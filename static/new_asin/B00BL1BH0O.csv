5636593,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Product description left me wondering about language.  I have sampled the first disc - main language is English with several options.  The picture is not HD, which I expected (so I'm fine with that).  No problems with audio.  The discs are in good quality plastic cases.  The outer box is very light - not standard for box sets, but I also expected that.  So far, I'm pleased with the value of the set and I know I'm going to enjoy seeing the previous episodes of what has become my favorite television program.  It is very hard to see the highlight on the selection icons - there is an audio marker that helps.",1411603200,50,611,4.401785714285714

5636606,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Huge Fan of the Big Bang Theory series. Got this collection for my mom for Christmas. I guess my favorite character would be Leonard. Leonard is like the normal everyday Joe. Seem like I have a lot in common with the Leonard character. Videogames, taste in women, movies. But think think that's how the creators intended his character to be. Great show watch to see the stupid and funny little everyday things these characters do. Highly recommend this Blu-ray collection for fans of the show.",1462060800,,493,4.811764705882353

Some nice bonus features too.",1452729600,,269,4.469387755102041

5636653,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Bazinga! See what I did there? You thought I was going to leave a negative review because of the title, then I clearly wasn't. Classic Sheldon.
My wife and I love this series! The box set is great. I noticed some other reviewers complaining of the quality of the first season. This is to be expected if you are watching the Blu-rays on a high definition TV. The series started before High Definition & Digital broadcast was the standard. After the first season you will notice when CBS switch to digital. Also, there have been comments about the menus on the first season. Yes, the color scheme was poorly chosen. However, none of these are deal breakers. Overall great series and a great deal on this box set!",1448150400,,710,4.5546875

5636787,5,B00BL1BH0O,Video/Audio are great HD quality nice and clear. Those who say its not HD must have poor TV resolution or poor Blu-ray players. I have compared these to my friends US Season 1 Set and they look the same. Season 1 episode menu is hard to see what your trying to select but that's only because of the colors they used on menu and it plays perfect in my US LG Blu-ray player.,1439078400,,372,4.109589041095891
5636788,5,B00BL1BH0O,"If you dig the Big Bang Theory and love bargains, this set is for you. Ok one or two of the episodes ia a tad bit grainy but otherwise this set is in crystal clear 1080P. The menu has issues from time to time but patience prevails. I love this show and if you're like me being able to see the episodes you've missed makes for big fun. It priced right. Less than $60 US and that is a bargain. Season 8  is about half of that. Love it.",1439078400,,433,3.865168539325843

5636792,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Finally got into the show this year and discovered why all the buzz. No Netflix binging on this title, and CBS wants an exorbitant amount of money to stream from cbs . com. This set is well worth the price, though I will echo the concern of some of the reviewers regarding the menu in the first season discs... The highlight is relatively hard to determine on the option buttons, but that does little to take away from the goodness of the product.",1438732800,,447,4.397590361445783
5636793,5,B00BL1BH0O,This is a great set to have. Can't wait for Season 8. I think this would make a nice gift.,1438732800,,90,3.55
5636794,4,B00BL1BH0O,"Wonderful show at a great price. Too bad you can't tell what you are clicking on with the menu. It shows no indication of a cursor. You have to go by clicking sounds. And if you stop it, you end up back at the beginning of the disk.",1438646400,,232,3.8541666666666665

5636808,5,B00BL1BH0O,"If you're not really into extra features but the show, this is a great price for what you get.  I don't know if the images are NOT exactly bluray quality as some reviewers have testified, but on my 55"" TV, I can't see anything worth complaining about.

5636814,5,B00BL1BH0O,"I live in Texas and they play great! This is a fantastic deal, a lot cheaper than buying them individually and they are Blu-Ray! I thought these would be too good to be true and I am so glad I was wrong! Buy it, you won't regret it.",1437609600,,232,3.8541666666666665
5636815,4,B00BL1BH0O,It's a great deal!!! My only complaint is that the format to navigate the menu is backward from what I'm use too. I use my PS4 to watch this and I had to learn how it work.,1437609600,,172,3.675675675675676

5636932,5,B00BL1BH0O,We have been watching re runs of the Big Bang theory and it was really confusing because they are all out of order.  I bought this series as a gift for my husband and it's great watching them in order.  My only problem is that it's hard to get to the next episode if you quit watching in the middle of the DVD.,1434844800,,310,3.9047619047619047
5636933,5,B00BL1BH0O,I Love this series,1434412800,,18,3.75
5636934,5,B00BL1BH0O,"For the price it can't be beat! Due to this product being an import, I was a little worried that I would have problems. The disks worked on all of my players and they looked great.",1434240000,,180,4.027777777777778
5636965,5,B00BL1BH0O,Perfect! And I really love this shoe it's hilarious in an intelligent way!,1434067200,,74,4.769230769230769
5636966,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Can't argue with the price. It's great to finally fill in the pieces of this show! Great packaging and the later seasons make it easier to navigate the menus and even pick up where you left off. First season is before it got picked up by the big boys with better cameras, so any reviews that it isn't HD are just flat out wrong. Looks fine on my 4K TV. Much better than watching the re-runs on satellite. It's Blu-ray!",1433980800,,418,4.2375
5636967,5,B00BL1BH0O,Great deal....good picture quality,1433980800,,34,7.75
5636968,5,B00BL1BH0O,My only criticism is that the scene selector doesn't work with my Sony Blue-Ray player.  Great value though.,1433808000,,108,5.0
5636969,4,B00BL1BH0O,The item was as described. It is of good quality especially considering the better price than other comparable items. As many have stated my first episode was of low quality but all I've watched after that have been excellent.,1433721600,,226,4.82051282051282
5636970,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Great price.  Skeptical that it would play in my player, but completely satisfied when the disks play as advertised.",1433462400,,116,5.105263157894737
5636971,5,B00BL1BH0O,Very pleased,1433462400,,12,5.5
5636972,5,B00BL1BH0O,"I waffled on whether to buy this since the reviews were hit and miss, but I watched every disc and had no problems.  Id never have known it was a UK export. I had concerns about some of the other customer reviews, so for anyone who wants to know:

1. I have a US Blu-ray player, and every disc ran fine. I suspect that some people had problems because their firmware is not up to date. (If your blu-ray player has wi-fi, youll probably be fine.)

2. The discs run at 1080p. The pilot episode is a bit grainy, but all the rest have a great picture. Its a softer HD than most movies use (probably because it was shot for TV) but its MUCH cleaner than DVD or even HDTV quality.

3. The menu always gave me the chance to resume and picked up right where it left off.

4. The menu of Season 1 is hard to navigate because they picked a bad highlight color, but the other 6 seasons menus are fine.

I honestly thought this deal had to be too good to be true, but Ive got no complaints.",1433462400,35,978,4.041450777202073
5636973,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Was very skeptical but the quality is great, other than ep. 1 and it's over 50% cheaper. Can't beat it!",1433376000,,103,4.2

5637014,5,B00BL1BH0O,"I enjoy watching the big bang theory. This set was awesome.
I got seasons 1-7 for such a cheap price. Normal price at Walmart
would have been 24$ per season. It was such a huge savings.
I leant them to my parents and they watched all the seasons in two weeks.

5637055,1,B00BL1BH0O,"Big Bang is great as usual.  The formatting of the disks is the problem.  The disks are from Ireland and to be fair the Amazon posting is clear that the disks are from the UK,  The menu would not come up at all for Disk 1 Season 1.  I almost returned them but decided to try the other disks first.  At least the menu comes up for the other disks but there are other little glitches.  There is a warning on the disk that you might have to go to a website and download new firmware.  Good luck with that.

5637058,4,B00BL1BH0O,I bnought this due to the price and wanted to watch the eposodes in order as I was not into this show when it first started. The price is great and it has good quality. The only thing i am not impressed with is the main menu where you select the episode that you want to watch on the screen you can't see what you are clicking on and are kinda guessing. Besides that its a great deal for the seasons.,1431388800,,400,3.950617283950617

I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the clarity. It does look nice, better than normal DVDs but falls a bit short of bluray. Id say its somewhere between the two. For the price, though, considering I've had no issuings accessing any content on the DVDs, I'm completely content with my purchase.
Comes in a box with 3 DVD cases holding Seasons 1-3, 4-6, 7 with 6 blu-ray discs in the first two cases, all nicely locked in with sturdy teeth. Arrived in mint ccondition.",1430438400,,572,4.509615384615385

5637134,5,B00BL1BH0O,"Fear not. All of the episodes are full HD. Yes, the initial episodes appear to have been shot with different cameras or lighting that give it a bit of a grainy look, but it it still sharp, 1080p HD video. Not sure how anyone could mistake this for SD. In fact, the menus and video quality are identical to the U.S. Bluray versions I rented from Netflix a few months ago. I will admit that the highlighting on the menus in the first season is subtle and you need to look closely to see that the selected item is a slightly different pale color than the unselected items. Can't beat the price! Less than sixty bucks (when I purchased it, April 2015) for seven seasons?! No brainer.",1429660800,7,679,4.354330708661418
5637135,4,B00BL1BH0O,"My wife got this box set for Valentine's Day and we watched all of the content together. This is a truly great value. As newcomers to the series we both enjoyed getting to know the characters and laughed out loud on several occasions. Many of the scenarios are recycled from older sitcoms, but the mere premise of several ""nerd"" scientists and a wannabe actress becoming unlikely friends provides a fresh concept which produces many unique scenarios. In this day and age of numberless CSI's and ""reality"" shows, this one stands out as a very entertaining alternative.

The packaging isn't anything special, but the content is very good. The episodes are displayed at a high resolution and there are plenty of extras included on each disc. I'm not sure if it is indeed region free, but all discs worked well in both my Samsung and my Sony blu-ray players in the USA. Complaints about difficulty with the menu are well founded, but only for the first season. A poor highlight color was chosen, rendering it very difficult to discern which menu option is highlighted. The menus on other discs are easier to see.",1429574400,14,1108,4.770833333333333

I offer it because I was concerned for quality at the low price of the set and not simply relieved but pleasantly surprised to receive a product superior to what I expected at a much higher price. Sound and picture are excellent on this set. Disc are secure in plastic cases and came in excellent condition.  It has all the standard features you expect of a blu-ray but also some very nice features I haven't seen before.  Within a season you can click to a particular episode and even if that episode is on a different disc, the interface will tell which disc to insert and begin at the episode you chose with no fuss.  Captions are available.  No problem with a US made blu-ray player.  Price is good.  If your a fan of the show this is a great deal, snatch it up.",1428192000,,829,4.24203821656051

Those who mentioned that this is not an HD set haven't made it past the first episode of season 1, which, being shot several years before the show was picked up by CBS, was most likely not shot in HD.

Good price for seven seasons (what I paid for the set amounts to less than ten bucks per season).
Packaging is OK. All of my discs were intact and free of scratches.
Episode titles and special features are listed on the cases.

Cons:
Beware: the discs are Blu-Ray, but the video quality is that of a standard DVD. The only plus is more episodes per disc compared to standard DVD's.
Poor menu interface. Difficult to see which icon is selected.

Conclusion: a bargain, but Blu-Ray image quality is mediocre. A bit deceptive, but not a deal breaker for me.",1424390400,3,560,4.59

I found this, read the reviews, decided to give it a try.  The packaging is minimal which I quite like, I usually get rid of Movie and CD cases because they take up so much room.  No need with this set.  The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is that I cannot pick which episode I want to watch.  The option is there but it simply doesn't function for any of these disks.  In order to pick a particular episode I have to fast forward to it.
