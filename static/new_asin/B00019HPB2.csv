8008793,3,B00019HPB2,"If you've been training for several years, you might not be surprised by the content on this DVD. Seeing Master Janjira perform his his kicks on the bag IS pleasing, I grant you (his punches also look quite sound); but the ""Special Drills"" are naught but: Working your abs while your training partner drops a double-end bag toward your face [to teach you lateral head movement against incoming punches], performing your kicks onto a bag while standing on a (weight)bench to improve your balance (this is quite useful, and actually quite challenging at first), using a heavy jumprope vs a standard jumprope to strengthen your arms,  and ""3 on 1 sparring;"" which is not 3 vs 1 simultaneously [a drill I strongly recommend, albeit I suggest you start with 2 vs 1] - but rather, is depicted as: sparring 1 opponent for a set time;  having opponent #2 relieve opponent #1;  then have #2 be relieved by opponent #3. That is, you spar 3 training partners one after another (with no break). There may have been other ""drills"" on the DVD,but I do not remember them. Wait, there was also a ""Plom"" [neck clinching] drill"" - practice neck clinching against your 3 opponents, one after another, until you are fatigued. It was nice to see an ""old school"" gym in the DVD (made me feel like I was in my yesteryears) and his pointers and performance are sound, but if you are intermediate and above, you might consider saving your money for another purchase. Please feel free to comment any alternative DVDs you might suggest, and happy training! Peace, MC",1118966400,16,1539,4.692592592592592
