7994069,3,B00009XN3A,"This is a rather odd movie in that it is a Swedish-Irish co production, relating the story of Victor Frankenstein (who, in the novel is from Italy) and depicting events happening in Geneva, Switzerland. As far as the movie goes, the adaptation is actually fairly close to Mary Shelly's novel and, as such, is one of the better versions of you want something akin to the original.  Having said that, the faithfulness also leads to some ridiculous scenes that do not work well on film, yet are copied from the book. Such as Frankenstein, having created the ""monster"" running up to his bedroom to hide under the sheets. And, the movie has a lot of philosophical dialogue back and forth between Frankenstein and his creation, which is a far cry from the more familiar mute, Boris Karloff version of the monster.  The real downside is the rather low budget and total lack of energy to the film (the book is rather dull).  The lame musical score and poor (at least on DVD) film quality don't help.  There are some nods to other film versions of the story, like the use of kites to conduct electricity to the monster during the creation scene, lifted from ""The Bride of Frankenstein"".  Worth a watch for Frankenstein fans and if you can get the movie at a reasonable price.  The 2004 made for TV adaptation is still probably the most faithful, but, like Terror of Frankenstein (aka Victor Frankenstein) is is also rather dull, which reflects back on the rather static nature of the novel itself.",1478390400,,1488,4.6603053435114505

7994071,4,B00009XN3A,"Beginning cynically. Why is it people assume if it's made forty years ago it must be accurate to the book? The Count Dracula mini-series with Louis Jordan, so many people praise as being more accurate than the Gary Oldman film yet it's not. It makes Mina and Lucy siblings, it combines Arthur and Quincey, Dracula did not de age... But I diagress... On with this.

Begins fairly well enough. It follows the book for the most part. It changes how the creature got the journal, how his hair looks (though it is long). Justine is left out entirely. Neither Victor or his creation are portrayed that sympathetically here. I think that's why I prefer the 2004 Hallmark version because you can see the mistakes they both make, the cruelty they both have, and yet you can also pity both of them.

This version is not bad but it's slowly paced. It's odd. The 2004 Hallmark Frankenstein (which is a bit more faithful to the book in regard to how the creature looked and maintaining all the characters) is three hours yet this hour and a half version feels longer. It would also have done well with a better budget.

This version is not bad but I still strongly prefer the 2004 Hallmark mini-series of Frankenstein.

Oh, one thing that I was very happy about is that they remembered Victor Frankenstein had not made the creature with pure science. He had studied books on alchemy and the occult, magick, Agrippa and Paracelsus.  He even discussed homunculi.  Very few versions acknowledge that there may have been alchemy and even magick in the creature's creation.  Few people realize this was not an anti-science ""Don't meddle in the affairs of God"" story.  The creature would have been fine if he had not been rejected by his creator.  It was about parental responsibility, judging by appearances, forgiveness and how revenge brings no peace.  Those were those were the real lessons of Mary Shelley's story.

This isn't a bad Frankenstein but the 2004 version with Luke Goss remains my favorite. I am happy this version exists so it's not a film I regret watching. I don't think there is any film I truly regret watching. There are just some films I feel better about being in existence than others because of what effort goes in to them. This tried to be true to the book but the 2004 Hallmark version with Luke Goss simply did it better.

Also it was a little hard for me to get used to the light haired creature. He was so much like the book, including hair length, save for the hair color. It's a petty detail but it stood out for me.

Something about it was a little dry, a little dispassionate. It's not horrible, just weak. Like the BBC play version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

At least they tried to follow the book.",1382486400,,2721,4.57201646090535
7994072,4,B00009XN3A,Had been looking for this version of this movie for a long time.  Nice to find it and receive it,1359936000,,96,3.8
7994073,3,B00009XN3A,"Don't get me wrong, I think this adaptation gets some things right, and it is by no means a bad film. I'm thrilled to add it to my collection. It's a perfectly respectable ""Frankenstein"", and was very likely the most faithful to its source material when it was released in 1976. However, not only would it be a mistake to call this version perfectly faithful to the letter of the text (there are several quite notable omissions and alterations), but where it strays from the SPIRIT of the novel is perhaps more significant.

As far as ""the letter"" of the text goes, the most significant change is that the character of Justine Moritz does not exist in this film. I'm surprised more has not been made of this by reviewers writing of its faithfulness to the novel, as Justine was a fairly prominent character in the novel and her subplot provided a lot of its emotional heft.

This film is notable for its breakneck pacing. At only 92 minutes, there's a whole lot to cover if you're trying to put together a faithful adaptation of ""Frankenstein"". Besides the Justine thread, it manages to touch upon most of the other important plot points, but in such a prosaic ""CliffsNotes"" kind of way, that none of them are really done justice. Unfortunately, squeezing so much into an hour and a half has been achieved largely by disregarding most of the novel's emotional depth and philosophical implications. Themes of godhood, humanity, responsibility and morality - themes that played a huge part in the novel, and are what give the proceedings much of their interest - are given very little time here. So the film moves along in a very ""A to B to C"" kind of way.

The film seems almost to be embarrassed by the sensationalism of its source material. It's as if the filmmakers set out to make an adaptation that eschewed all the melodrama of previous versions of ""Frankenstein"", forgetting that the novel itself, a proper Gothic through and through, was WILDLY melodramatic! Unfortunately, in this seeming attempt to be a ""more respectable"" or ""more serious"" telling (it's adapted from A BOOK, after all!), it actually loses some points on the ""faithfulness"" front.

Take, for example, the ""building a bride"" sequence. [Spoilers ahead!] Branagh's version has been criticized for its all-around over-the-topness, but I feel that for the most part this over-the-topness is pretty much in keeping with Ms. Shelley's novel. In . . .

THE NOVEL - Victor nears completion of the monster's bride, but then changes his mind and tears the body limb from limb while the monster, looking on through a window, howls in rage and despair! Crazy stuff!!

MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (BRANAGH) - Victor's motivation for ""building the bride"" is completely different here. It's his own dead bride Elizabeth whom he wishes to reanimate. He actually goes through with the reanimation and we see the bride shamble around a bit, and Victor and the monster scuffle for her affections, before she destroys herself. Some people got cheesed off about this because it was over-the-top and too big of a departure from the novel. I would argue that 1) it's no more over-the-top than what's in the novel, and 2) I'll take THIS departure over . . .

TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN - Victor is still working on the monster's bride. The monster walks in. They talk. Victor says he's changed his mind. The monster verbally expresses unhappiness with this state of affairs, vows revenge, and walks out.

What the - ?!

Sorry, but this scene represents what I don't like about the whole movie. They don't GO FOR IT. Same with the DeLacey sequence. Same with Elizabeth's murder. Again and again the novel offers wonderful opportunities for drama, opportunities to break our hearts or put us on edge, and again and again it refuses to deliver. Neither a low budget nor the looming hand of the censor will serve as an excuse; there are plenty of ways to excite us viscerally and emotionally without SFX or objectionable content, ways that have more to do with the editing, camera placement, etc. - but the makers of this film just don't seem very interested.

It's not simply that there is no terror in ""Terror of Frankenstein"", but that the filmmakers weren't interested in making a frightening film. The original title, ""Victor Frankenstein"", implies that maybe they were more keen on the ""character study"" angle. But at barely over 90 minutes, barely enough time to cram in all the text of the novel, let alone the subtext, it does not succeed any better as a character study. We really understand very little about either Victor or his creation by the time the credits roll. Sure, we get a handful of lines of dialogue that are supposed to boil their motivations and their existential quandaries down to their essence, but at such a breathless pace with not a moment to spare to really explore these character points, they feel more like pieces of a clockwork than something organic and feel-able.

I've harped on this movie enough. You're probably wondering why I'm giving it 3 stars. I'd have given it 2 if I could. This movie is exactly half good. Let's say the extra  star is because it's a little more than half worthwhile, being a landmark in cinema's ongoing struggle to make the perfect ""Frankenstein"" adaptation. I'm certainly not saying that's easy. Ms. Shelley's novel is great, but flawed. And some things that work in a novel do not work in a movie, so the idea of judging a film by how closely it follows the letter of the book on which it's based, while obviously valid, can only go so far.

The acting is okay. The wide shots of landscapes are very nice. Stacey Dorning, who plays Elizabeth, is super cute. The print, though not perfect, is perfectly watchable. And the price is right.",1339718400,5,5749,4.7716297786720325
7994074,4,B00009XN3A,"I would certainly go along with the idea that ""Terror of Frankenstein"" is the most faithful of all of the adaptations of Mary Shelley's gothic novel, but despite that fact this 1976 production ultimately falls flat with me. The question is whether the fault, dear reader, is in Shelley's novel or if there is something about the film director Calvin Floyd (""Vem var Dracula?"") has made that is more responsible for the net effect. This Scandinavian effort was originally entitled ""Victor Frankenstein,"" and I want to see in that an attempt to remind movie audiences that the name Frankenstein is supposed to be the mad scientist and not the monster.

Actually, I have never held that Frankenstein becoming the name of the monster was the biggest change wrought by James Whale when he made ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" In Shelley's novel it is not Frankenstein's trying to be like God and bringing his creation to life that is his great sin, but rather his abandonment of the creature. But in those Universal films it is the act of creation that is the big act of hubris and trying to be like God, which goes all the way back to the Towel of Babel and eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. ""Terror of Frankenstein"" focuses again on the act of abandonment by Victor (Leon Vitali), which motivates the Monster (Per Oscarsson) to try and force his creator to own up to his responsibilities.

The pace of this film is slow and for a mad scientist Vitali is overly sedate for a guy tampering with the power of life. The original music by Gerard Victory is used sparingly, so that you have lots of key moments where nobody is saying anything and there is nothing to be heard. This is a really quiet monster movie, which is okay because this is a fairly quite monster, more given to discourse than rampaging (even when he is killing people). So while there is an emphasis on fidelity to the novel, Floyd's film does not bring what is on the printed page to life, which is pretty ironic when you consider what ""Frankenstein"" is all about. On the other hand, the film is arguably the least violent Frankenstein movie, which means teachers could show it to their classes if for no other reason than to convince them the book is better.

Ultimately, ""Terror of Frankenstein"" has to be compared to Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film version ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" Both films begin and end with the Arctic sequences that served as the framing device for the novel, and the screenplay by Steph Lady and Frank Darabont incorporates a lot of the novel and Robert De Niro's performance as the creature is provocative, but Victor struts around without a shirt and the whole idea of turning Elizabeth into the monster's bride sends the movie off of the deep end. But there is a passion and intensity to Branagh's telling of the tale. It is not just that his version has more passion and intensity than the ""Terror of Frankenstein"" but that basically every other Frankenstein movie I have ever seen comes ahead on those scores.",1130371200,2,3051,4.677839851024209
7994075,5,B00009XN3A,"This 1997 Irish/Swedish cinematic interpretation of the Frankenstein tragedy is more faithful to Mary Shelley's original novel than any version filmed before or since, including the overblown 1994 Kenneth Branagh production that purports its faithfulness by using the name of the novel's author in its full title.  While TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN (a.k.a. VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN) is obviously a low-budget un-Hollywood film and does not, therefore, have the same slick-and-shiny production quality of the better-known 1931 James Whale film or the aforementioned Branagh version, the well-written, faithful screenplay and the superb talents of actors and director make it, in many ways, superior to all others.
Those familiar with Shelley's novel already know that it is an allegory that plays on many levels.  On the surface, Dr. Frankenstein's blind obsession with learning to create life and the consequences of his success can be viewed as a cautionary tale, warning the self-important intellectual of the dangers of presuming upon the realm of God.  On a deeper level, Frankenstein's rejection of his creation and the creature's consequent reaction is allegorical to the contention that often exists between father and son, especially when the father disapproves of the son's ideals or lifestyle.  Deeper still, the creature's attempt to reconcile with his creator--at least to some degree--reflects the Biblical story of Mankind's original fall from grace and subsequent attempts to regain favor with God.  In at least one of the introductions that she herself wrote for various printings of FRANKENSTEIN, Shelley suggests that all these themes are, to some extent, woven into the narrative of the novel.  And unlike many other filmic interpretations, all three of these concepts are also at work on some level in TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN, making it an accurate thematic reflection of the original work.
TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN also reflects the novel's depiction of the creature as an intelligent and articulate being, which is very unlike the usual dumb, lumbering brute that most other filmic interpretations offer up.  Not that the monster isn't ugly, because he is certainly that--a gruesome, rheumy, jaundiced-looking giant, much like Shelley described.  But rather than simply a fright-inducing Hollywood gimmick, his ugliness symbolizes the chasm between a father and son or, in a Biblical sense, the Sin that caused God to oust Mankind from the Garden of Eden.  (Though this combination of intelligence and physical ugliness was also a characteristic of Branagh's 1994 film, the make-up in TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN is much less flashy and pretentious.  The creature's appearance serves the story, not the other way around.)
This film is a must-see for fans of the Frankenstein mythos, especially those devoted to the original novel.  But the general filmgoing audience should also enjoy it, as the acting is fantastic (and in non-dubbed English, by the way) and the directing superb.
The DVD from Wellspring Media is basically a no-frills disc, the only extras being trailers.  It offers the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and though the film does look like it has been digitally cleaned up--i.e., there are few (but some) scratches or dust artifacts--it has not been ""restored.""  The color is sometimes off (e.g., there are times when the snow looks yellowish instead of white), and the shadows are generally not a deep, crisp black.  However, the price is reasonable and the disc is still quite viewable, and being that this is a lesser-known foreign film, this is likely the best that will ever be offered.
Condensed review: Five-star movie, faithful to its source material; three-star DVD quality.",1077148800,16,3717,5.342465753424658
7994076,5,B00009XN3A,"I would rate this 4 1/2, leaning towards 5 stars. This is a really visually and stylistically beautiful film, not to meantion a haunting experience. There are images within this film that will stay with you for years. This is not a fast paced ""mad-scientist"" movie as most would expect. This film captures the morbid/melancholy/gothic atmosphere of the original book almost perfectly. In fact it is virtually taken directly from the book with only a few minor details altered. The performances are very natural and very European giving it a sense of believability that most Frankenstein films lack. The morbid, filthy, and atrocious nature of Frankenstein's experiments are expressed very well in a series of shocking and disturbing scenes. The creation scene is played out very much the same as it was written in the book. We're really not quite sure exactly how the monster is brought to life. If you're familiar with the original story, there really isn't much difference. A couple elements in the story are condensed, but that doesn't really take away from the film overall. The framing of Justine is left out and the death of Frankenstein's father is implied rather than shown. The cinematography is beautiful and the atmosphere is intense. Leon Vitali is excellent as the tormented, remorseful Victor Frankenstein, but Per Oscarsson steals the show as the monster. Oscarsson, a specialist in neurosis plays one of the most impressive monsters in a Frankenstein film. There is something very unnerving, unnatural and disturbing in the way he moves, looks and even talks. Just as it would be with an artificial man. He's less hideous than disturbingly unnatural. Oscarsson expresses the monster's alienation from the human race in a very subtle, yet heartbreaking way as we watch him go from innocent child, to bloodthirsty, vengeful monster. Overall if you enjoy Gothic melodrama this is your bag. Definitely worth seeing for it's faithfulness to the original text.",1044921600,14,1970,5.140186915887851
7994077,5,B00009XN3A,"This ladies and gentleman, is by far the only true cinematic telling of The Modern Promethies. I saw this film long ago on Captain USA on the USA network. I was awe struck to see the monster being shown as he was always suppose to be shown.
The long black hair, the yellow complextion, the deep sunken yellow eyes and the thin black lips. No flat head here folks. This is the way Mary Shelly described her creation! This masterpiece had almost every single scene straight out of the novel. It even had the scene where the creature murders Henry Clerval at the top of a cliff. Clerval liked to rock clime you see. No other version had that scene, not even Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. All that film had was Clerval screaming NOOOO! on the middle of the stair case in Frankenstein's home. We never find out what happenes to him. The only films closest to this one are: Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Frankenstein Unbound, and Frankenstein: the true story. See this film (The Terror of Frankestein) ! It is the closest adaptation of the novel yet.",1001289600,4,1040,4.596774193548387
