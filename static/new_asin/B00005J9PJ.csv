8041638,2,B00005J9PJ,"Prem (Salman Khan) is happily married to Pooja (Karisma Kapoor) until he becomes infatuated with model Rupali (Sushmita Sen).  Pooja is devastated when she discovers his infidelity, and then forms a plan to win him back.

Humor is an intensely personal thing, and for me, watching Prem deceive his wife while trying to appease his mistress was not funny.  The acting was great, and some of the musical numbers spectacular, but I just didn't enjoy the plot.",1491955200,,456,4.896103896103896
