2534414,4,B000EU1Q18,"I purchased this dvd set for my husbands 40th birthday since he is an avid football fan.  I was somewhat hesitant to purchase the set d/t various negative feedback/reviews I had read.  My husband is THRILLED with the set.  He finds the coverage enjoyable and entertaining, as well as informative.  The coverage is interesting and includes facts as well as actual gameplay.  We are pleased with the purchase and would not hesitate to buy another set for any diehard football fan.",1171238400,3,478,4.851851851851852
2534415,1,B000EU1Q18,This is a washed down version of the Superbowls. I am sick to think they are charging this outrageous price for what generally amounts to nothing new,1167177600,10,149,4.555555555555555
2534416,1,B000EU1Q18,"If you think your getting the Super Bowls, you're not. It's a glorified season in review and and 20 minutes of each ""Super Bowl"" is dedicated to the actual SB. This is nothing more than the stuff they show on the off season when there is nothing else to keep the NFL fans fed. I'm going to try and return this, but I'm sure it won't happen...",1167091200,17,342,4.119402985074627
2534437,4,B000EU1Q18,"This is a great set. The Seasons from 1966-2005 are shown in a documentary like video showcasing mainly the teams in the afc/nfc championship games, with it finishing with a piece on the superbowl game. I will warn you, the care of the packaging is horrible. Mine came in with discs all over the place and i had to super-glue the cases properly becuase they were not even attached. But beside that setback, this is a must have for anyone interested in the NFL.",1296086400,3,460,4.488095238095238
2534438,5,B000EU1Q18,"I was very pleased with the item, especially for the price.  I bought it for my son who is 9 and he is really enjoying it.  The discs feature quick highligts of the preceeding season, longer reviews of the Chapionship games, and narrated highlights of the Superbowl games - plus special features like interviews etc.  As long as you were not anticipating full renditions of the games, you will be pleased with these highlights - at least we have been.",1293667200,3,451,4.6125
2534439,5,B000EU1Q18,"I consider myself a major fan of the NFL and it's history and this set is simply fantastic.
I was going to purchase it based on the NFL Super Bowl highlight films alone.
Then I read that it has a synopsis of each season and that made it even better.
What made it even more valuable is that the the season overviews of each particular year are the original NFL season overviews from 1966 through 2005. Therefore, offering classic NFL Films nostalgia from the late 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and half of 2000s. As well you get additional classic NFL Films programing on the special features sections. In all between the SB highlight films, the season overviews and the special features you get more classic NFL Films material than you ever thought possible in one set.
Also, each Super Bowl film includes the original intros often times edited out on television when they choose to start with only the game highlights.
All though I own the America's game set as well, I can assure you that this is the better deal if you only buy one of the two.
The America's Game Dvds are awesome as well and they offer special features as well.
However, they are more current in their hindsight, as they were produced in 2005/06 with modern day actors as the narrators.
By all means it is a great set but if you grew up watching NFL Films ""old school"" productions and/or like the feel you get from the Classical Music and Narration that made NFL Films what it is today then the SB I-XL set is much more recommended.
Trust me, if you purchase this item you will not be disappointed!",1292371200,4,1558,4.470175438596491
2534440,2,B000EU1Q18,"This is not a collection of Super Bowls I-X. It is only an overview of the Super Bowls. Super bowl III was about 16 minutes and included huddles, kicks, shots of the side line and fans. The discs also include a superficial look at the whole season. Personally, I thought I was watching commercials for the Super Bowl. Maybe a collector would want it; but, I think most people will want to pass on this set.",1278892800,3,406,4.355263157894737
2534441,3,B000EU1Q18,"I bought this after much deliberation between it and the ""America's Game"" complete set.  I'm so glad I bought this one, since you get a balanced look at the Superbowls, teams, and the seasons.  These are truly outstanding dvd sets, I'll be watching them forever and since I'm 47, I get a real nastalia trip back into the 70's when I was in high school (we loved football on network TV).  There is a serious issue with quality control however.  Not only is the packaging falling apart, as mentioned before, but a few of my dvds look used, with many superficial stratches on them.  I did not buy a used set and it was factory sealed.  I don't know if they took in a return and re-packaged it but the scratches I see are more than a blemish, on one disc particularly, it looks like someone played frisbee with it.  However, it appears that all of these dvds work.  I went through them and found none that froze or skipped around or anything like that.  Not sure if all work perfectly but I don't have time to preveiw every dvd; I'll take my chances.  Having said all of this, it is still an amazing amount of NFL footage, highlights, and some extras that I will watch forever (if the dvds actually work like new).  It would have been given 10 stars for content but -5 for quality control.  I did not send it back because the next set could be worse and I really like the content (so, its my fault if I get burned).",1269993600,,1411,4.283018867924528
2534442,1,B000EU1Q18,"I recently received this and the packaging was off. The plastic pages of each DVD collection set were all out of the booklet because the glue didn't hold. So I figured it was a one time mistake, so I made a exchange. The second set was in even worse condition. I now understood why the set was marked down from 150. There were more pages unattached from the booklet than not. I was very upset but because I love the Super Bowl so much I decided to keep it. I didn't feel like keep exchanging the product for a new one only to be disappointed a countless number of times. This is not Amazon's fault, they did not put these packages together. It is NFL Films, or whoever distributes their videos.",1266451200,6,694,4.305343511450381
2534443,5,B000EU1Q18,"This is something really wonderful to have.  No, it doesn't contain the whole game, it's more along the lines of what you get when you watch the NFL Channel's replays on Monday/Tuesday.  However, it's got great commentary and other features for each Superbowl as well as nice histories of what went on that season pre-superbowl.

For any football fan, it's something to have.  Beyond that, for any 'not really diehard fan' it's something that doesn't bore or get too 'technical' - so just about any interest level can have fun with it.

Fantastic buy.",1261958400,5,551,4.819148936170213
2534444,5,B000EU1Q18,"hi! i found this dvd set to be excellent! each season is individualy broken down and then concludes with a reel of  super bowl highlights. i think that whole games would take to long to view and that the footage is just enough to give the viewer a sense of the total game. the music and announcer are perfect for the films,which i would suggest any  nfl fan to purchase. just a tip in purchasing the set,i bought mine from a amazon seller for 36.00 it came shrink wrapped and in great condition. before you buy check out the ""used"" copies,their are real bargains out there!!",1248048000,,574,4.40566037735849
2534445,5,B000EU1Q18,"I practically stole this from Amazon. They ran a one-day sale on the day of Super Bowl XLIII and I got this 20 disc collection for $55.00!
It comes in four attractive cases, and each case has a replica Super Bowl ticket along with an informative booklet that contains each Super Bowl's roster, game program cover, even the winning team's ring choice. Very cool.
One negative was that some of the disc holders had come unglued from the cases, but my wife's glue gun fixed that problem.
On the videos themselves: While I have only watched two discs so far, and while yes, the 48 hours of content are season summaries ending with a Super Bowl summary, and not the entire Super Bowl, play by play, I think the collection is perfect. As I Giants fan, I already own discs devoted to their three championships, so a 15 minute summation of any other team's Super Bowl win is enough for me. And anyway, I like the longer season summaries better. It's a great nostalgia trip.
Some have complained that these videos are already shown on the NFL network. Well as a cablevision subscriber, I don't get the NFL network, alas. Still, you get to OWN the videos, and watch them whenever, in any order you like.
Forty years of NFL history sit on my DVD shelf, and are a perfect cure for the sports death month that is February. I hate college basketball, so my sports void is filled until the Giants start camp in five months.",1233964800,12,1408,4.482490272373541
2534446,4,B000EU1Q18,"This is a nice collection of stories about Super Bowls and their corresponding seasons.
However, these are only the TV shows that you can watch on NFL Network. I was expecting more extras, since a DVD format allows that. But the extras are just 5 to 15 minute accounts and interviews and just two per season. A more detailed account of the best games of every season would be warrant. Indeed, the best NFL games I've ever seen were mostly Conference championships, Divisional playoffs and wild-card games. It is a pity that many of these are just given a glance (few seconds) within the season's overview. Many superb teams did not make it into Super Bowls, albeit they played the most exciting NFL games ever. For example: late 70s Oilers, late 80s Browns, early 90s Oilers, Chiefs and Vikings, etc. These teams and playoff games deserve a better place in NFL history.",1206662400,2,869,4.723684210526316

2534448,5,B000EU1Q18,"NFL Films is amazing.  Their stuff gets better every year.

This 20-disc series, covering the first 40 Super Bowls, is quite possibly the best multi-disc set produced by the raving geniuses at NFL Films.

Two Super Bowl contests are featured on each DVD.  A sweet bonus item, which has been included with each Super Bowl highlight film, is a 45-minute regular season highlight film, which includes selected highlights of all the NFL teams -- not just the two clubs that eventually ended up in the big game.

Just be careful not to confuse this series with the so-called ""America's Game"" series, involving the first 40 years of the Super Bowl era.  That other 40-disc series focuses separately on the teams that would become the Super Bowl champions, examining their full season leading up to the big game, as well the Super Bowl, of course.

But either way, you will not be disappointed.",1200873600,7,887,4.796052631578948
2534449,5,B000EU1Q18,"I recently bought this product for my boyfriend for his birthday. He is a football fanatic, and was absolutely blown away after opening this. Gratned, IT DOES NOT CONTAIN FULL LENGTH SUPER BOWLS. It is still one hell of a way to make a loved one in your life happy.",1193097600,11,265,4.32
2534450,5,B000EU1Q18,"I really enjoy this product, if you want a story by images of the NFL, here it is. The season recaps give you an idea of what happened and the Superbowl reviews are simply great, covering well all key plays, strategy, and personal drama. Plus you have some add-ons that fit nicely in the seasons, focusing mainly on players and coaches.
Beware of the region though. In Europe this WON'T work and you will use a program to decrypt the CD and making it playable on your PC.",1188259200,2,471,4.363636363636363
2534451,5,B000EU1Q18,"My husband received this for his birthday, and we have really enjoyed watching it. There's so much information packed into these discs. No, not the whole game (but could you imagine, for example, watching Super Bowl XLI again? Yawn!). There's plenty of game footage and special interviews/etc. And the best part, even though they use NFL Films footage, the early discs use the old voice talent, bringing back great memories for the hubby. The only con is when we argue about whether to watch the glory days of the Packers or the Cowboys!",1181174400,3,537,4.78494623655914
2534452,1,B000EU1Q18,"This is great for what it is, only highlights.  However, the more I have been thinking about this, the more I realize that Highlights JUST ARE NOT ENOUGH!  These highlights only wet my appetite for more!  That is why I am giving this a low rating.  I used to think that highlights are better than nothing.  But I no longer feel that way.

Imagine, for a moment, if you could not rent or purchase your favorite movie - but instead, all that was available was ""highlights"".  And even worse, say it was highlights of that movie mixed in with highlights of all of the other movies of that year, or of that actor, or of that director.  You get the idea.  I think it is unlikely that anyone would even begin to suggest that highlights could replace the real thing.  Instead, there would be an outcry like the world has never seen.  Ok.  So I exaggerate.

Back to these games.  Imagine if they were never aired at all.  Imagine sitting down on a Sunday afternoon and all that is available is ESPN highlights of the games played that day.  Would that be enough for you?  It sure would NOT be enough for me.  I expect to see the entire game as it is played - uncut - unedited, and without after-the-fact commentary spoiling the excitement of the moment.

Fortunately that is what we get with live broadcast of football.  It is also what I believe should be made available for the greatest games of football past.  All of the past Super Bowls.  And all of the greatest games of past seasons and playoffs.  Time for a cliche argument:  We can spend billions of dollars to put people into space, but we can't put an entire uncut football game on DVD.  Ridiculous!

I am a long-time football fan. I realize that the entire games might not have the vast general appeal that most movies have.  But, on the other hand, there seems to me to be a built-in audience of fans of not only the past generation that enjoyed those games live - but the current generation which would enjoy seeing the classic games of their favorite team(s).

I know I would!  I was not old enough in the late 60's and early 70's too watch and/or appreciate the games of that era.  But I would be first in line to purchase those classic games (assuming tapes exist for some or hopefully all of them) as soon as the companies who own them realize the demand that exists and releases them on DVD.

I realize, as someone has written, that these games are likely owned by the network(s) and not by the NFL.  I don't see where that is relevant to the ultimate issue - the release of these games, uncut and unedited, including the original broadcast play-by-play, IS LONG OVERDUE!  Whoever owns the rights to these games needs to read the reviews on this and other sites demanding that these games be released - and realize that for every one person who takes the time to write a review, there are thousands more who feel the same way.  And if it is the networks, so be it.  Let THEM release the DVDs.  Makes no never-mind to me WHO releases them - just so they are released!

I also realize that some of these games may no longer exist - that the tapes/etc may have been destroyed due to lack of storage space.  So be it.  That is no excuse to not release the ones that ARE available!

I am not asking for the moon.  I am not suggesting that all of these games need to be released at once.  I would be happy just to see a beginning.  And I can't think of a better place to start than the classic Super Bowls of the 60's and 70's, starting with the first one of which tapes of the original broadcast are still available.  I'll be one of the first in line to purchase it!",1179964800,24,3621,4.308605341246291

2534454,5,B000EU1Q18,"This is pure heaven for any true NFL fan. Highlights of every Superbowl since 1967 are presented here in one glorious package. Each Superbowl has a 25-30 min ducumentary about the game itself and is preceeded by a 20 min review of the season that led up to it. Not only this but each game also has a couple of extra documentaries about the key players/events. The photography is fantastic, the music is adrenaline-pounding and the packaging/booklets include full player listings, score breakdowns, programme covers and reproduction tickets.

This box set will only disappoint those who were expecting the full game broadcast for every Superbowl but then does anyone truly think that's feasible at over 3 1/2 hours per game! Go on, treat yourself and work through them 1 to 40 to get a fascinating insight into the development of the game and first sight of every classic play.",1174176000,25,876,4.879194630872483
