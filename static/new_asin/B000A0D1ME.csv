I have purchased the entire Duvall series to show once my students have read the tall tale. The videos are well done, include humor, and, for some students, include actors the students have seen elsewhere. These videos enhance my lessons.",1340755200,2,332,4.946428571428571
8071075,5,B000A0D1ME,"I give it five stars because I remember watching it as a young'un, although I haven't seen it in about 17 years.  It's a fun and comical view of Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth.  His travels take him to the place Paul Rodriguez deems ""FLOREEEDA.""  They take him to a hilarious cameo by Dr. Ruth Westheimer who resides on the other side of a quicksand pit (""Don't call me, I'll call you."")
All in all, it's a great tale for the younger set and hopefully it is as good to you all as I remember it being.",1194566400,3,535,4.174757281553398
