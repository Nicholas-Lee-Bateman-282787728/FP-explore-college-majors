3622764,1,B001H4PA0S,"If you're in the mood for a film arranged around the relentless, overenunciated narration of a surpassingly bland main character, ""Watch Out"" is the film for you.  I beg everyone else looking for the kind of shocks and outrageousness behind this film's advertising campaign not to make the mistake I did -- put on a blindfold and pick out anything by Russ Meyer, Herschell Gordon Lewis or Guy Maddin and count your blessings.",1260489600,7,425,4.821917808219178
3622765,5,B001H4PA0S,"There's been a lot of buzz about this actor Matt Riddlehoover (one very easy on the eye man) and this director Steve Balderson. I had to check it out for myself. The disc contains some 4+ hours of material. The film - with and without commentary - plus over an hour of bonus video blogs. I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing quite like this. I'm still trying to absorb what I saw and heard. This is a keeper to watch again and again and well worth the price of admission. Act 1 is way-over-the-top-bizzaro-titillating comedy. I kept thinking - where is all this leading? Act 2 take an unexpectedly darker turn until the end. There's ample nudity - OK, more than ample. Someone ask Matt Riddlehoover if he did his own ""stunts"" and he said ""why, yes I did."" I'd say this film is a must see to believe, but that's just my opinion. I'll be waiting for Part 2!

3622766,5,B001H4PA0S,"I bought this DVD, hoping to enjoy a gay themed movie that wasn't a ""B"", with all the movies out there, this is one of the better made.  The acting wasn't bad, and the movie did a great job of holding my attention.  Its not your typical gay movie style, but I am happy to have this in my collection.",1236816000,2,299,3.966666666666667
3622767,3,B001H4PA0S,"I bought this movie due to the reviews saying how brilliant and entertaining it was. So, I decided to make the investment. After watching the movie, I can say I probably would never watch it again for a long LONG time. The first part of the movie (1hr duration) shows the true character of Johnathan, and how self-centered he really is. Some of it is sort of dry humor, while some of it left me on the floor in laughter. It was sort of a love/hate relationship; I loved how self governing he was, but at the same time, I hated how he responded to people around him. Matt Riddlehoover is certainly nice eye candy to view throughout the movie, so this definitely adds some points. The last thirty minutes shows how sadistic Johnathan is when people push his buttons. I suppose it was hard for me to digest due to it being such a high contrast of character for Johnathan. The man hates touching people with a passion, yet doesn't mind touching them when being cruel to them. This film is definitely out of the ordinary; not something you want to sit down with mom and dad for family entertainment. The film started out strong, but seemed to dwindle in the end.",1232236800,2,1157,4.436619718309859

3622769,5,B001H4PA0S,"What a joy!  This is the sort of eccentric film that made John Waters so famous many years ago, only with better film quality.  Matt Riddlehoover is perfect in the lead.  It is always fun to see a parade of eccentric characters who don't quite fit into society's mainstream.

Though Mr. Riddlehoover is naked for parts of the film, it isn't sexually explicit by my standards, and certainly isn't erotic.  The combination of roles, combined with acting of a high standard, makes this is a real treat for the viewer.",1228780800,12,514,4.666666666666667
3622770,1,B001H4PA0S,"While some people say it is better to have made a bad movie than to have made no movie at all, this movie really makes me question that line of thinking. This is a fairly ridiculous film that takes sexploitation to a new level. Clearly, the filmmaker was trying to shock people and create some kind of perverse Toxic Avenger, and perhaps on that level, he succeeded in finding a new high in being low. Watch Out is an appropriate title because you should watch out for buying this DVD. Painful to watch, tedious, and absurd. The scene where the protagonist's parents are filming him having sex for the first time was the epitome of cringe-worthiness. Watch Out! You have been warned.",1406678400,2,683,4.60655737704918
3622771,1,B001H4PA0S,Very badly done written and acted. Nothing fits together. Matt Riddlehoover should stick to doing porn. I would stay away from this and most all films he is in,1361836800,2,159,4.517241379310345
3622772,1,B001H4PA0S,"I earned a PhD from one of the top state universities, so I'm not totally stupid.  But, even after watching this movie TWICE -- once on Netflix and once on Amazon -- I still have no idea what it is about. Why did i watch it twice?  Because Matthew Riddlehoover Is stunning and prancing naked through much of the film.  I can tell you in excruciating detail what happens scene-by-scene, but I cannot for the life of me tell you what it all means.  The first portion of the film is some sort of satire or parody I suppose, but the second half departs from that theatre-of-the-absurd genre and becomes a sort of strange *maybe* commentary on megalomaniacs and psychopaths. Boring.  The anti-hero is unlikeable, and portrayed in sneering malice by Mr. Riddehoover, who whether naked or clothed is beautiful.  However, the budget for the film was apparently so small that the producers would not spring for an iron to press the wrinkles from Mr. Riddlehoover's costumes, nor would they authorize the expense of tailoring his sportscoat/blazers to fit him in sleeve length. He's an actor with some promise, and beauty to spare, but the material he has to work with here is, to say the least, weakly crafted.",1352073600,6,1201,4.722488038277512
3622773,1,B001H4PA0S,"people keep making such crap films? This is can be ranked as one of the WORST FILMS EVER (along such ""masterpieces"" as ""I want to get married"", ""Hey happy"" or ""Denied"").
Acting is so horrible that I had really made myself to watch this ""horror"" till the end titles...Plot? Even worse.
There are some full nudity scenes in, but believe me, 90% of blue movies is better than ""Watch out""!
I have found a couple of positive reviews on Amazon.com, but I am really puzzled reading them. How anyone could find this drag thing attractive?
I wish I could give big zero *.
You have been warned!",1342051200,2,584,4.4672897196261685
3622774,5,B001H4PA0S,"Mr. Barrows is a clever fellow that has issues. I think that Steve Balderson did a great job, considering the fact that the book was brilliant and it could not have been an easy task to make it into film. Great movie in how strange and different it is from everything you have ever seen before.",1336089600,,294,4.267857142857143
3622775,2,B001H4PA0S,"Steven Balderson's adaptation of the novel by the same name would be yet one more piece of indie picture dead wood were it not for the quality of its source material. For its production value at a budget of 300,000 it is quite good and will likely continue to accrue greater cult status as time passes. However it must be said that this film betrays and falls short of the promise of art made and delivered by Dr. Joseph Suglia's novel.

The single most glaring flaw was the selection of Matt Riddlehoover for the role of Jonathan Barrows. We take Jonathan Barrows at his word when describing the glory of Himself based on the reactions of others to him -he must fend off many, many sexual advances. Riddlehoover is sufficiently good looking for the world of this film, -convincingly desirable he is not. One is simply confused at the lustful advances of these people because his features do not and would not merit it. Not even from the cretins populating the town. Riddlehoover is Balderson's Jonathan Barrows, and not Suglia's. Riddlehoover's vocal effeminancy utterly violates the Greek God physical perfection of Jonathan Barrows and is completely at odds with the source material. (Ryan Reynolds is likely the only good candidate for this role. Billy Ray Cyrus fits the former rockstar profile Suglia mentions in pre-2008 interviews, though he is aging.)

Despite Dr. Suglia having his hands in the creation of the script, Director Balderson failed to translate his language into film in such a way as would indicate a nuanced and sympathetic understanding of the source novel. This film is Balderson's best guess:- the film he made demonstrates neither adequate apprehension of- nor sufficient insight into what Suglia penned, and what he arranged for him.

Director Steve Balderson's slaphappy approximation of Watch Out will be amusing and adequate for most, especially those who do not read. All pretense to charity aside, it is an unfortunate vulgarization of genius. Then again, just as Suglia said ""F*** the reader."" so said Balderson shortly thereafter ""F*** the viewer."" The message of this review in two words: F*** Balderson.",1327449600,4,2142,5.028169014084507
3622776,1,B001H4PA0S,"The only thing that saved this boring B movie was Matt Riddlehoover's cuteness.  The script was bad, the acting was bad, but Matt is oh so cute.  That's all that this movie is worth is to see Matt.  Should've been 'more' of him to see, though, to make up for the dumbness of the movie.",1291075200,,285,4.1454545454545455

3622778,3,B001H4PA0S,"The title simply states, Strange BUT Interesting, and that rings true. Matt Riddlehoover's performance was creepy and yet very appealing. Mr. Riddlehoover is very good looking, has an outstanding body, and is perfect for the main role. The story in itself is twisted but entertaining, yet weak at the same time.",1265932800,5,311,5.117647058823529
3622779,1,B001H4PA0S,"Not only is the central character in this terrible film self-absorbed and self-indulgent, so is the film itself!  This silly little diddy relies far too much on narration to make its rather inane point.  The script is abyssmal and the actors are mediocre.  The film has the look of a slightly more polished, but certainly not more entertaining, Troma film (the makers of ""Toxic Avenger"" and other cult favorites).  But it possesses none of the skill Troma is known for in telling campy stories.  I wish I hadn't wasted money buying this nonsense.",1263513600,,546,4.827956989247312
