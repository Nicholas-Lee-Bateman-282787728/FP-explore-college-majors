Pretty cheesy dialogues that were supposed to look like casual conversations but that were overly staged and rehearsed.  Not very helpful in generating discussions.  The book (the actual title, not the participant's guide), on the other hand was a great book to discuss with a small group, and a challenging perspective on the topic.",1370736000,2,409,4.970588235294118
