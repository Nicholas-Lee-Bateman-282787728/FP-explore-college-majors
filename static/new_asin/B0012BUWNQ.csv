3086365,5,B0012BUWNQ,"My wife was urging me to lose weight and improve my physical condition. Now I know her motive was very genuine; she was concerned about my health. You see, I was very overweight and inactive and she was worried that one day I was going to have a heart attack or even worse. I didn't want to go to a gym so she said she would find me an exercise video to do at home.

She ordered the Mr. Gym Couch Potato workout series and even agreed to do the workouts with me just to help get me started. Well guess what? It's been three months and almost 45lbs less between us and we both love what is happening to our bodies so much that she still does the workouts with me today! We can't wait to get home now just to debate which workout to do that day. They are all so much fun and easy to do and more important they work! This is the only exercise video series that I know that makes no outrageous promises but delivers great results.",1202774400,9,926,4.060109289617486

8245067,2,B0012BUWNQ,"This has to be a joke. Not for anyone looking for a continuous workout. I realize it's for couch potatoes, but this is beyond even a lazy persons workout. Way too much talking in between sets, pointless if one must go at such a pace.",1501977600,,233,4.2
8245068,4,B0012BUWNQ,"Pretty good work out if you are really a beginner in the world of workouts.  I am a total couch potato and this was challenging for me but not so hard as to put me off from continuing.  I am really getting the hang of the exercises and can feel my muscles burning when I do this.  The instructer is rather dry, but is good at explaining what the exercises are and the goals for the routines.  The multiple workouts make it easy to readily change up your routine.",1370995200,,462,4.157303370786517
8245069,2,B0012BUWNQ,"Read other reviews online about this being a great easy basic beginner workout able to be done by very overweight people. It is very basic in fact done in someones living room! If you can get over the unproffessional element thats one thing...I have very bad knees and my mother has a bad ankle...we couldn't do this workout! The problem is that they have you getting up and down from one move to the next and even on your knees for part of it. Not good for people  with arthritis or knee problems. Moves were simple enough, no aerobics just toning exercise. Disappointing overall, especially for the money! Would not recommend unless buying used somewhere for cheap.",1335312000,4,667,4.700854700854701
8245070,3,B0012BUWNQ,"I rented this through Amazon's Instant Video feature.  This was not what I expected.  I do not think the average ""couch potatoe"" could do very many of the exercises!  This is a regular aerobics and resistance workout.  In my opinion, if you are looking for sitting exercises to do while watching TV, look elsewhere.",1332547200,2,315,4.777777777777778
8245071,5,B0012BUWNQ,"Mr Gym's Couch Potato Workout Collection is a great set of DVDs for those who are just starting out on their fitness journey.  The Beginners work out starts at an easy pace(though don't get me wrong, you will feel your muscles working) and all exercises are carefully explained and demonstrated.  The instructor encourages you with every set but is not irritating as some instructors can be.  Another positive is that music is used sparingly throughout and when it does it is not loud.

I have purchased a few exercise DVDs in the past and found that they don't cater for beginners or those who are over weight.  The times I have followed these DVDs I have usually given up or lost motivation because they are simply too difficult.  However with Mr. Gym's Couch Potato collection the easy paced exercises are achievable, therefore increasing my confidence and chances of long term fitness success.",1286496000,,897,4.868421052631579
8245072,5,B0012BUWNQ,"I had a problem with my order, but Amazon quickly fixed it. It was worth the wait. This is one of my favorite exercise videos. Each exercise is demonstrated and explained. The exercises are easy enough for a beginner to keep up with.",1211673600,,233,4.441860465116279

8245075,5,B0012BUWNQ,"This is a great workout. I am a beginner and after just a few weeks, I already feel the difference.  Thanks Mr Gym.",1203120000,2,115,4.0
8245076,5,B0012BUWNQ,"I have bought and tried several exercise videos over the years. All of which made promises of giving me great weight loss and toning results in a short time. The only weight I lost with them was in my bank account for the money I wasted on them.

I recently bought the Mr. Gym Couch Potato workout series with much skepticism. After a few months of using them, this is all I have to say.... I can't believe how much better I feel and how much better I look! This exercise series is the best home exercise plan on video! With its ease of use (especially for me because I was overweight to begin with) and it's easy to follow instructions, I would recommend this exercise video series to anyone who truly wants results rather than empty promises.",1202774400,4,744,4.391304347826087
