8030282,1,B0002PUH4M,"This feature includes maybe some 20 minutes total of actual behind-the-scenes footage of what goes into making a Source Awards show happen.
The structure, if it can actually be called that, is based on MTV's The Real World; testimonials,strategically-placed cameras and all.

The rest is a mockumentary about the lead character Shawty going to the award show to get laid, and the two female protagonists strive to have sex with rappers/gain video model careers. 80% of what's on this DVD is scripted, and to be honest, not scripted very well. We had no reason why we should care about these characters. Basically, instead of fully taking advantage of  the atmosphere they were in and making something legitimately informative (they had backstage access, for heaven's sakes!!!), they half-as*ed it with BS subplots; i.e. the whole scooter thing, the whole threesome thing,etc.
Watch at your own risk; I felt myself losing brain cells.
If you want decent doc/mockumentaries; check out Confessions of a Porn Addict, This is Spinal Tap,Lil' Wayne's The Carter,Joaquin Phoenix's I'm Still Here, My Date With Drew, American Movie, Inside Deep Throat, Method Man's The Strip Game, everything by Nick Broomfield, anything by Fenton Bailey, etc.
Thank for taking the time to read my review.",1290297600,2,1281,5.213592233009709
