8548962,5,B00AA9QJ3I,"I am a great admirer of the music of Wolfgang Rihm. I have been listening to his works with concentration and satisfaction for the past three years. He is an extremely prolific composer, and I am amazed by the sustained high quality of work after work for the past half century. Photographs always show a smiling, even laughing face, and in a filmed interview he was genial, self-deprecating, and smiling. But his music is not characterized by these traits; it is intense, dramatic, loud, searing, cathartic - you get the point. Given those musical qualities, is it any surprise he would make an opera of one of the most relentless tragedies ever written? You will not be reminded at any point of Stravinsky's marvelous version; Rihm's work shows not a trace of that earlier neo-classical masterpiece. His is an expressionistic version, with Kreon especially, who comes across as a madman in a stunning coda to the tragedy. Andreas Schmidt brings dignity, beauty and, of course, fatal pride to his role. He is certainly an innocent in this version, but that does not spare him from the whips and scorns of outrageous fortune: he suffers terribly if nobly. The orchestral score is powerful and varied. Rihm's skill at orchestrating events, characters, actions and feelings is outstanding.",1413763200,,1287,4.9906976744186045
8548963,4,B00AA9QJ3I,"What a pleasant surprise to find that Arthaus Musik was releasing a video of Wolfgang Rihm's 1987 opera ""Oedipus,"" a recording which had apparently been slumbering in the vaults for 26 years!

This is a recording of the premiere performance at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in October 1987.  From the liner notes I gather that it was broadcast on German television.  The work was commissioned by Gotz Friedrich, the stage director of the opera house, following the successful staging of Rihm's ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tutuguri/dp/B00008NRIR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tutuguri</a>&nbsp;in 1982.  If you know Rihm's music, you will not be surprised to learn that the score is dark, atonal, and expressionist -- ""emotion full of complexity"" in Rihm's memorable phrase.

The baritone Andreas Schmidt is absolutely central as Oedipus.  He conveys well the intended innocence and bewilderment of the character as it dawns on him what he has done (though one does grow tired of him gazing upward for long stretches as if to find the answers there).  Emily Golden has a splendid mezzo-soprano voice and does a great job of acting the role of Jokasta, wife, and as we know, mother of Oedipus.  William Pell lends some serious bite in the role of Kreon, and he steals the show with his manic monologue at the very end.

Christof Prick leads the Orchestra of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.  The Chorus of the D.O.B. is featured only on tape, a very strange effect in an overall quite visually striking production.  Rather than a proper on-stage chorus, Rihm and Friedrich deploy 16 solo male voices as the Theban Elders, who appear in business suits and masks throughout most of the action.

Rihm created the libretto by splicing texts from Sophocles, Nietzsche, and Heiner Muller. This splicing results in one puzzling omission.  Of course we know the story, and the ending is predetermined.  The opera is full of foreshadowing and a growing sense of doom from the beginning.  But the moment when the truth is finally revealed to Oedipus is curiously anticlimactic.  The tragedy rolls on to its fore-ordained conclusion, but lacking any dramatic punctuation by that revelation.

I don't find ""Oedipus"" to be as powerful and successful as Rihm's previous opera,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hamletmaschine/dp/B000025RVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hamletmaschine</a>, written from 1983-1986 and premiered in April 1987, but it is much better than the later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Eroberung-von-Mexico-The-Conquest-of-Mexico/dp/B000001RVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Eroberung von Mexico (The Conquest of Mexico)</a>&nbsp;(see my reviews of both).

8548964,4,B00AA9QJ3I,"This is a video release of the 1987 world premiere of German composer Wolfgang Rihm's opera ""Oedipus"".  This release is also one of a series of new, important releases from the Berlin Opera on the always relevant Art Haus Musik label.  I have only been somewhat aware of Wolfgang Rihm, who was part of a ""new wave"" of young composers in Germany in the late 1970s and beyond.  The story is of course the fairly well known Greek tragedy of the young warrior who strives to be king after successfully passing the riddle posed by the oracle at Delphi.  Later we know that the Oedipus had unknowingly killed his real father, marries his actual mother and is brought down by the jealous Creon. Oedipus blinds himself and is doomed to wander as a blind, powerless beggar. Other opera treatments of the Oedipus legend throughout the years have included somewhat successful treatments by, most notably, Stravinsky, Enescu, Purcell and as ""Greek"" by Mark-Anthony Turnage.  While none of these is especially well known, the best known is the Stravinsky and - for me - Turnage's represents a very solid contemporary effort. Part of the problem is the story which does not lend itself to long narrative and the surprise plot twists are not approached gradually; Greek tragedy was largely moralistic. Wolfgang Rihm is a talented composer who, by now, has written many works including other stage works; mostly in European venues. (One of his finer recent works is a Violin Concerto written for Anne-Sophie Mutter) While his music - especially at the time of Oedipus - was a kind of ""anti-avant garde"" it is still angular, non-diatomic and very difficult to perform.  The staging of this Oedipus, too, with the libretto by the composer is creative but somewhat minimal. This performance, under the direction of Christof Prick is excellent and the video transfer is high quality. This is a work to be curious about and to admire for the craft. I cannot honestly say this is one of my favorite twentieth century works (or beyond)  In large part, it is still a hard work to get behind although it is fairly straight forward to follow. I found it revealing, I suppose, that the audience reaction at the end of this live video was quite mixed. There are clearly audible ""boo""s as well as some enthusiastic ""bravos""  I am somewhat mixed in my thoughts about the piece but I have heard or seen live hundreds of operas including the ""modern"" ones.  Most viewers will enthusiastically embrace this work for the craft and creativity involved - or not.",1360540800,6,2526,4.8018433179723505
