It is truly like someone copied from an OLD VHS -- that was taken off of channel 5 and was eaten by their dog.

....besides that it is fine :)

I am not making fun, I doubt there is a master copy of this flick so this may be the only way to see it.. Believe it or not this is one of my fave movies so I have been searching for this. As you can see in other reviews, there is a love/hate thing with this.. you either love it .. or hate it I *remember* watching this over.. and over.. and over so I love it for nothing else --even if just for the nostalgia :)

I am happy to see it on DVD and I DID like the movie itself, but lets say you have a version on VHS.. you will not get much of a better quality version here. (Except no commercials of you recorded it off the TV)

I give it 4* for the movie and 1* for the copy.

Great extras-including an interview with Gordon Liu himself!!I also recommend the Wu tang Clan's other titles like Shaolin Drunkard and Revenge of the Patriots.",1018396800,,320,5.173076923076923
7943273,5,B00005KH41,"The Wu has shown us the way again with the Hidden Chambers series!!!! The extras are the BEST ever on a DVD release. Dozens of clips,an interview with the Master Killer himself(!!!), and Wu wizdom from Papa Wu himself. There's even a Temple of Knowledge chamber where real monks pour our their philosophy. Ground Zero and the Wu Tang Clan have it locked down. The flick is alright,but not as good as his other works. He does fight the bronze men though. The extras are longer than the movie I think. I got my moneys worth big time. I have all the series now.",997315200,,558,4.375

This is listed as a Gordon Liu movie, however, even though he is in the majority of the movie He does little kung fu in it. Dont get me wrong there is plenty of decent to good martial arts In this movie its just he does about 20% of it and the rest is done by unknowns. Also the opening credits list Philip Ko (aka Kao Fei) like he is a lead in the movie and he plays  A villian who gets killed in 4 min!
You will also see quickly that parts of this movie were also in Shaolin Drunken Monk. Now Im not saying that this is one of those rip off movies, to me it looked like this movie Was shot first and because the movie did not feature more of Lius kung fu, the film owners Must have decided to re-shoot a new movie but took parts of this movie to make SDM.
If you watch closely you will see the same drunken master, same little boy that played liu As a child and the guy who played Lius brother are all in Fury and SDM.
The storyline is simple, two masters are on the run after being accused of stealing a book from Shaolin. The two have sons and actually switch each others children. The thought being to teach Ghost fist and Dragon Fist styles to each child so that when they get older they can combine the Styles to make a vicious new one.
While Liu character called Yeung Wang is still a child, his master is attacked by rogue monks And kidnapped leaving Wang alone. He later finds his way to the Shaolin Temple were he learns Kung fu. Meanwhile the other Child is being taught by Lius real dad the Dragon Fist. Confusing?
Anyway to make a long story short, the two finally meet after Lius real dad is killed. The fists are Combined and glory saves the day.
The picture looks like it actually came from a 35mm film rather than a video transfer so its very Very good condition. The Sound is excellent. As for the movie, Gordon Liu fans will be  Disappointed as he really does not do much Kung fu in this movie. I read that because Godfrey Ho Was staple at Shaws that Liu did this film as a favor to Ho after Shaws began to close down. He should not have done it as this is not a great movie. Like I said there is good action and Good martial arts as they were choreographed by Chan Yuet San who was the drunk priest in The Buddha Assasinator. He also appeared in Shaolin Drunken Monk too!
As for the DVD, once again Ground Zero blows the competition away with the total setup And display of this disc. It has and interview with Gordon Liu, various film clips that Featured some variation of 18 Bronzemen, Gordon Liu Film Clips, previews of other Ground Zero releases like The Best of Shaolin King Fu, The 9 Venoms and others, A music video, brief interview, and Lyrical blades from Wu Tang, more words of wisdom From two real life Kung Fu instructors who look like monks and a page that will link you  To the GZ site!
But with all those great extras it can not save this horrendous waste of Gordon Lius Talent  And time. It will be great when Ground Zero releases a DVD with a great movie as well As great set up. Judging from the Wu Tang Hidden Treasure collection you aint gonna Find a great movie in the mix. Just average ones.
If you are a collector of Liu movies get this, otherwise, keep the money and spend it on  Something else. I wish I did. I rate this movie a 2.75 out of 5 ( SDM was only a 3).",997315200,4,3342,4.119631901840491
