8300510,5,B001F0TSX4,"I rented this movie because I wasn't sure about it.

  Don't wait for Amazon and delivery sometime after 25 December 2008.

  Rent it now and watch now it is a great movie. Nothing spectactular about the scenery, just a great story and some very fine actors showing a series of events in the lives of 4 boys/men as they grew up together. A lot of people will be able to relate to this story thru personal experience as they were growing up.",1227916800,3,440,4.304878048780488
