2444979,5,B000BXHHSO,"Robby does a great job of covering all the basics in volume 1. He starts from scratch and this can be annoying to more experienced players, but listen keenly to what he says and it will help you. Volume 2 is more intensive and more directly related to hockey but volume 1 is the right place to start. There's no reason not to buy this. Robby Glantz has coached several NHL teams and dozens of players. He's not a hack, so listen up and become faster. His tips have vastly increased my speed and explosiveness. I'm one of the fastest ten players in my adult league.",1272758400,2,564,4.330188679245283
2444980,5,B000BXHHSO,A must for intermediates. Everything is explained in detail and helpful drills are given on every tecnique. Helps you to master the basic principles of skating.,1256860800,3,160,5.1923076923076925
2444981,5,B000BXHHSO,"As a totally new skater, I was looking for an instructional offering that would allow me to enhance my skills. I wanted something that was fun, engaging and allowed me to watch and learn from.
This DVD met all of my criteria. I especially liked the manner of delivery which was fun and engaging. The camera angles and out takes highlighting specific techniques were excellent. The presentation by Glantz was also excellent. I actually had fun watching this.
If you are new, or want to learn better technique in your skating abilities, then I would highly recommend this dvd.
This DVD is great for those just getting into skating but also intermediate skaters as the techniques highlighted certainly are the basis for elevating your skating.",1241308800,3,740,4.928
2444982,5,B000BXHHSO,"This product may not help great skaters or beginners but if you follow the video and do the drills it will make an average skater great.  I liked this DVD because of the little things described which has helped my skating tremendously. There are many close ups and Robby gives very good tips and explanations. You certainly will get your money's worth for less than $14.00 or about the cost of 2 skate sharpenings. My stride, stopping, turning have all improved immediately.",1234915200,3,474,4.780487804878049
2444983,5,B000BXHHSO,"I found this video to be very helpful in improving my skating speed and agility. The dvd is very helpful to both beginners and pro's alike.

The DVD demonstrates the proper body positioning, weight distribution and is presented in an easy to understand and follow manner.

I highly recommend grabbing volume 2 as well, it improves upon the lessons and information in this dvd.

Having first watched volume 1 and then volume 2 of Robby Glantz, I was quite disappointed with Laura Stamm's DVD, if you are trying to decide between the two, i would suggest getting this over Laura Stamms.",1233446400,5,584,4.762376237623762
2444984,2,B000BXHHSO,"This is OK.  It has some creative drills, however some of the concepts they show are not sound hockey practices.  Worth getting, but don't take everything presented to heart.",1215907200,,174,4.9655172413793105
2444985,5,B000BXHHSO,"I'm just starting ice hockey at the ripe young age of 38.  I bought this DVD and the Laura Stamm DVD to help learn skating.  While both are excellent, it seems to me that the Stamm DVD is going to be more useful down the line as I pick up more skating experience and comfort.  The Glantz DVD I find more helpful in actually teaching the moves/techniques shown in the video; therefore, I find it more helpful for me right now as a beginner.",1213660800,9,439,4.2023809523809526
2444986,5,B000BXHHSO,"If you want to get fast on the ice, this is your video to get there. By no means does this replace hours of practice on the ice, but it more than makes your time there a catalyst to boost your speed. You have to put in the effort though.

About a week after I ordered this, I fractured my leg so I was off the ice for 5 months. Once the tendons got back into shape I hit it hard with the drills in the video. I started with doing ""dry land"" drills in my living room in front of the tv to get my leg loose and teach the muscles to ""memorize"" that movement. Then came ice time. I know I'm faster because now I can catch the guys I played with before the injury when I used to just watch them fly to the other end of the ice. They're impressed!

If you're serious about getting faster and have access to a patch of ice on a regular basis, do these drills at least twice a week and you'll see your game improve greatly as you can now be in position to make great plays rather than watching them from down the ice.

2444987,5,B000BXHHSO,"Being an aduly rec player, this is the most useful hockey instruction video I've seen, and I've seen many. It's packed densely with information and produced flawlessly. The only complaint one mught have with it is that it doesn't teach some advanced moves, but volume II of this series does.",1173484800,9,291,4.84
2444988,5,B000BXHHSO,"This is a must have for anyone who wants to play hockey.

The camera angles and detailed instruction leave nothing to the imagination.

This is the best instructional video I have ever seen.

I'm 49 and have been playing hockey for about a year, I used to poke check at the other players as they went by, after a couple week of practicing the techniques on this video, I caught a high school kid from behind on a breakaway and kept him from getting a shot on goal.",1163030400,15,464,4.25
8093733,5,B000BXHHSO,"Volume 1 is more skating only, while Volume 2 is skating with puck handling.  Volume 2 is definitely for hockey players intermediate and up.  Some may questions whats different from many video clips on the internet. Quality of instructions are definitely worth to buy.",1482364800,,268,5.068181818181818
8093734,5,B000BXHHSO,"Great for beginners (recreational skaters and hockey skaters) to intermediate hockey skaters), and even advanced hockey skaters. Volume 1 is more skating only, while Volume 2 is skating with puck handling. Some may questions whats different from many video clips on the internet. Quality of instructions are definitely worth to buy. If you are a serious skater or like to improve your hockey game, you will not regret it.",1482364800,,421,5.115942028985507

8093737,5,B000BXHHSO,"This does good job of teaching proper technique for hockey skating.  Hockey skating technique is a lot different than figure skating technique, which is taught in most learn to skate programs.  If a hockey player doesn't have good technique, they won't be as fast as they could be, and speed is everything.

The technique shown in the video is very similar to what is shown in the Laura Stamm video.  I think the video quality is better in this video, and it's style makes it more watchable for kids.  The video has given me (not a good skater) enough info to be confident that I am coaching my kid on the correct way to skate.

Surprisingly, hockey practice does not spend much time on correct technique for skating, but spends the most time on stick handling and positioning drills.  So most kids will need some skating technique coaching outside of practice.  This video helps a lot.",1416182400,,886,4.634615384615385
8093738,5,B000BXHHSO,Thought that this was very informational  and helpful. So glad I got it. Will be sharing this with my grandson's.,1398038400,,113,4.65
8093739,5,B000BXHHSO,The instruction presentation was clear and concise; it was well organized. Seeing Granato and Duchesne demonstrating the skating techniques was great to watch. When I skate I am constantly concentrating on what I saw on the CD and I am improving my technique. I wish I had this CD when I was a kid!,1383696000,,298,4.537037037037037
8093740,5,B000BXHHSO,Explanations are offered about why the moves work and the camera catches the footing needed to perform the skill.  I have bought volumes 1 and 2 and rate them both highly.,1376611200,,171,4.516129032258065
8093741,5,B000BXHHSO,"I bought this for our 10 year old grandson Bobby who is an eager hockey beginner looking to catch up with those he plays with who have been playing hockey for several years. Last Spring we bought him Laura Stamm's power skating book and DVD which were helpful. I watched the Robby Glantz DVD before sending it to Bobby. It looks to be very well done and should be helpful. I'm most concerned that Bobby is ""running"" on his skates rather than pushing off properly. The Glantz DVD has excellent video showing the proper hockey stride and much more. I would recommend this DVD without hesitation.",1356825600,3,593,4.60377358490566
8093742,5,B000BXHHSO,"Robby G's dvd of power (hockey) skating techniques is great.  I have been skating for 10 years and I picked up some good pointers from him.  I had gotten away from some fundamentals.  The camera shots are great you can actually see the position of the skates and bending of the knee.  Lower is better in some sports.  Buy it whether new or veteran skater.  Well done video.
