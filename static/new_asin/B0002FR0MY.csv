8027860,1,B0002FR0MY,"Disappointed because the DVD was imported from England and I couldn't play it on my DVD player linked to my TV here in the USA. The DVD was probably restriction ENCODED regionally for Europe which is Region 2 and the USA Region Code is 1 and in the process of it being imported from England, the encoding was not changed to Region 1. The only DVD players that will probably playback this DVD would have to be a Region Code FREE Player.

I was able to view this DVD on my iMac computer which probably by-passes the Region encoded restriction. If it wasn't for this Region restriction code that could not playback on my DVD Player-TV here in the USA, I would rate this movie with 5 Stars. I really am affected by this meaningful movie which graphically portrays how suppressed recollection of rape during childhood and accompanying parental betrayal in accusing the child of being a lier can have such impactful psychological damage-wounding extending into adulthood.",1425513600,,965,4.778443113772455
8027861,4,B0002FR0MY,How did they get so many big stars to be in this one TV movie?  Liked it a lot.  Maureen Stapleton and Mike Farrell are terrific... but it's Kelly McGillis that stands out. This was just after her great performance in WITNESS.,1334275200,,226,4.357142857142857
8027862,3,B0002FR0MY,"This pilot produced as a possible television weekly series that did not come about, features a psychotherapist, Dr. Joe Braden (Mike Farrell), who becomes closely involved with his patients, away from his office, the plot blending two separate cases, an ostensibly compulsive nymphomaniac, performed by Kelly McGillis, and a cab driver (Tom Bosley) who is suffering from audio hallucinations; additionally, Braden's associations with his former wife and with his daughter, along with a possible new romance for him fill the landscape of the scenario.  Farrell gives an obviously well prepared and nicely nuanced reading as a therapist who cares deeply for his patients, while McGillis and Robert Vaughn also provide strong performances for a film that is ably directed, acted and photographed; however, other than brief dialogue concerning matters of psychologic theory between Braden and a Freudian psychoanalyst with whom he shares a medical suite, at issue are serious mental and emotional maladies that are patly solved within the script in cavalier fashion, reducing the believability potential of Braden who apparently, during a televison series, would be obsessed with problems of his client&egrave;le week after neurosis-saturated week.  The DVD version offers no extra features, other than an inadequate scene index.",1116460800,3,1325,5.62
